The other was Tom Zander. Did you do your home work on that dumb dumb yet?


With much thanks to Core (including BlockStream) people, partially even before they were called Core or BlockStream. Yet still he managed to sabotage SPV wallets and mount an attack that still lives on among his braindead followers today.
With again many thanks to Core and BlockStream for fending off that attack and continuing to harden Bitcoin.

That's sooo soooo weak. "Evolution or intelligent designer?" "Aah.. just a matter of opinion."
So you're saying for no other reason than just an opinion, we're now burning a shit ton of electricity daily to do the PoW? Just a preference? Really? We could do it with 0 cost instead, but just because it makes us feel coze, we'll chose the 6*24*$600 per day option?

So would you say it would be smart for exchanges (and other big hodlers) to, in advance, have a set of pre-signed transactions sending all the funds to a new cold-storage address and including a high fee (or better: multiple versions with increasing fee). Have these transactions ready and waiting on a completely independent machine running a full node monitoring the mempool.
Then when a security breach happens where the attacker tries to move the funds, this machine automatically sends in the first of the prepared transactions to outbid the attacker.
It's no guarantee, but sort of a last resort rescue service after your ship has already sunk.
I guess a downside would be that you need to be able to sign such breach reversal transactions after each new deposit, which means having the keys more exposed in the first place.
EDIT: Well I suppose there are much smarter and safer options available with (2-of-3 timelocked OR 3-of-3 without timelock) scripts, or something along those lines.

Yeah was a bit messy, sorry about that.


Well, if it was a matter of choice, I might possibly disagree with myself too. Unfortunately it looks like it's not really a choice. That seems a huge part of the whole block size debate in the first place: people *want* all kinds of nice sounding shit, but they don't understand that some things are simply not a choice. Most of this stuff is limited by external laws (physics/math/game/economics/whatever). That's why it took decades before Satoshi even found a narrow trail through the wolf infested dark forest.
Demand for free global extreme-redundant storage is obviously infinite. Clearly people would dump the whole pirate bay on there.
Similar for almost-free (very low fee). I could encrypt my data and use the blockchain as a cheap backup medium, dumping Gigabytes or more into it every day. Or wikileaks would pay a little and do their data dumps on there.
So free and near-free are out of the question anyway. The other extreme is a $million per byte fee. Nobody would ever pay that. So it seems like the demand curve looks to be infinite at fee=0 and smoothly trending down towards 0 at some high price. I don't see any reason to assume such a curve would be non-continuous or make weird jumps up and down in the middle. Sure there are other effects that influence demand (general popularity, ease of use, resistance to hostile hard forks, trust, stability and price of Bitcoin for example) but those are not going to change the general shape of this curve.
Sorry, long story.. need to run. Will try to finish later.

FYI: It used to be possible (and useful) to download the blockchain data files via bittorrent, but then when starting the Bitcoin client it would still do a full validation on those files and build a whole UTXO set from it. So no extra trust was required at all.
The reason that method disappeared is because Bitcoin can now download block headers first (small and fast) and then download the actual block out-of-order from different peers simultaneously. Effectively doing the same as Bittorrent, except more efficient as it can also do the validation and indexing in parallel. SegWit will improve this further, as a Bitcoin node can choose not to download the witness data for old blocks at all.
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:28:41
You're too kind and patient. I have huge respect for that. But i can't anymore. I can't stand trolls creating new accounts and staying the whole bs over again every few weeks.
Your level headed debunking of their bs helps a lot in showing other readers who has science and logic on their side. But it also leaves a lot of room for casual readers to pick up a few of the lies and having a warped picture of Bitcoin and it's community. Bullshit needs to be called out as what it is. Enough of the politically correctness and equal time for both sides of the debate. For me anyway.

Bull shit. If I create a &gt; 1MB block today (otherwise valid) Unlimited will fork off (and probably rejoin back later, when main chain overtakes, maybe not even, I don't give a fuck). Classic too.
Either way, they still failed: whether they didn't have the balls to believe their own outrageous bullshit and launch or pussied out, doesn't matter. Fact is, it proves noone was dumb enough to follow them (except for the few that were, hope you aren't one, for your sake).

That brings back questions like who do you trust? How are you certain you're talking to them and not some MITM? And how do you know that they didn't download their blockchain pruned from the same place? What about Sybil attacks? And before you know it you're full circle and you need to build a block chain to solve it.
Which would actually work, I guess: a blockchain with just the hashes of the whole UTXO set and the bitcoin blockheader at each moment in time. Add some PoW... And, as an optimization, we could take that new blockchain and integrate it into the Bitcoin blockchain and share the PoW. That's UTXO commitments again (extremely crudely... if a Core dev reads this, they'll shoot me).

The blockchain will be fine, but the UTXO set may have been doctored. That's why I said if you only need to trust confirmed transactions, you'll be fine anyway as you're letting the miners do the checking. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:23:49


It would help if you realize you're just parroting what unqualified liars told you. You're being used a a sock puppet.
Remember all the lies they've told that never materialized. Pay attention and make sure to remember who's lying here, don't let them fool you again.
For example Gavin Andresen who claimed 20MB and 8GB was all perfectly fine and fully tested. jtoomim later confirmed with his own independent data that 4MB was an absolute max before severe problems would start. Well, sorry if people with a bit more data than him prefer to keep a bit of a safety margin and think ~2MB with SegWit is enough for now. (block size, more transaction capacity is actually still in the pipeline too.) Adding Craig Wright and some other blunders, the only option is to write off and disregard Gavin.
Another example: all those drama queens claiming Bitcoin would die because of the halvening. "SegWit must be before the halvening! Hard fork before the halvening! Block time will double or tenfold after the halvening! Fees will skyrocket!" I didn't keep track of names, but I assure you most were in the camp. You can simply disregard all of them from now on.
I could go on and on with those examples from the past 3+ years of block size (and other) drama.
The world is too large to give everyone a 2nd chance: if they fuck up, you start ignoring them until they positively prove themselves to be telling the truth again.
Scaling capacity is in the pipeline and perfectly on time and in the best way possible: no sudden increase, but smoothly growing extra space depending on how many individuals consider needing it. The ultimate poll amongst users: "Do you want bigger blocks, then simply say yes by using SegWit transactions."
Even though blocks are not really full at the moment, you may as well get used to them being full all the time, because that's exactly the healthy state things should be in: enough transactions waiting in a queue to fill each next block on a high fee first basis, nicely forming a free market that pushes out the spam and inefficient abuse. Like the wasteful Coinbase.com practices. If you want to complain that blocks are full, go to them, they can probably single handedly increase capacity by 20% or more.
@_date: 2016-08-29 07:37:01
Yes it is. Although it's not so much the blockchain that you're trusting, but the UTXO set.

Yeah it's probably dogslow.
Greg was doing it to prove that no hard forks have ever happened: if the old version can validate today's transactions then by definition no hard fork has happened. Consensus rules are still compatible i.e. only soft forks.
I don't think he was trying to prove that it's a smart idea to actually run such an old version.

I never said anything about the halving. Besides, nothing happened during the halving. Another one of those doom conspiracy theories that melted away in the face of reality.

Blockchain == ledger == bunch of valid transactions.
The purpose of a script in transactions is to _validate_ that requirements have been met to make it a valid transaction. That means one person can do all the work necessary to create a proof showing that those requirements have indeed been met. All other nodes simply _validate_ that proof, without having to do all (or even know about) the actual work themselves, as is would be insanely redundant to have the same work be done twice (let alone by everyone).
Example: I require 285471 be factorized before this coin can be moved. You do the work and include that in the transaction you create: 3^3*97*109. All other nodes don't have to repeat the work, all they need to do is make sure that 3^3*97*109 equals 285471 (and all those factors are primes).

Property is only a thing because a government regulates and protects it. In nature there's no such thing as property. You only have property thanks to the government: you got schooling, inherited shit from your parents, you got work, you got roads to get to work, you got vaccinations, you got a doctor and firemen and food. And you got an army to protect your ass and property against invaders. You're using technology invented by the government or government enabled institutions daily. Without all of which you would be long dead already, and I'm pretty sure dead people have even less property.

Lot of work is being done: faster block relay with compact blocks and faster verification through various means. That means miners can validate faster, so even if they do validationless mining, at least it will be for a shorter period of time. The number of empty blocks has gone down somewhat over time.
There have been suggestions to make it actually impossible to do validationless mining. Basically by requiring the miner to commit to the current UTXO set. But I'm not sure of the status of those. They're bigger changes with effects in other areas that need to be worked out to the best possible solution, so it will take longer.

Worst of all: he was refusing to make BitcoinJ based wallets more secure, not putting in all kinds of safety checks and warnings to the user in case the Bitcoin network is under attack.

BitFinex SHOULD eventually try to re-acquire ALL BFX tokens, to ever be able to make the claim that they're clean again.
They can start by BUYing as much as possible at market price. Maybe a bunch every day.
It's UNethical to NOT do that, as that would mean the BFX price would just plumit, screwing every rightful owner. And whatever promise BFX may bring in the future would go the few risk takers buying up all BFX now for pennies on the dollar.

Sigh. 
Do you listen to yourself? Are you retarded?
You can't validate a block without having the block in the first place!
Headers first means headers first. Header means NOT whole block. Transactions are NOT in the header. Only a whole block contains all transactions (and header). So headers first means NOT validating all transactions. So headers first means NOT validating the block (until later).
In other words a transaction inside a headers first block that has not been validated yet is actually a 0 conf transaction. 0 conf is not secure (and actually worse if it confuses you into thinking it's 1 confirmation, which it isn't). So headers first is eroding what Bitcoin means and what PoW is about, undermining the security for everyone.
And since it's only a worthless stopgap measure that unfairly benefits centralized large miners, it's not something to promote our support and it sure as fuck is not a magic unicorn solution that they try to sell it as.

Meaning yes they will fork with a few blocks, meaning that bitcoin unlimited users are at risk of easily being partitioned off the network and double spent.
Criminally insane irresponsible devs. Dumb users.
And yes it does mean that this shit is live and the experiment is underway (fit a long time). The fact that the fork hasn't happened yet merely confirms that that experiment is bullshit and unnecessary to begin with. Also confirmed by the fact that such an attack has not happened yet: the potential for theft (which is the best measurement for adoption) is laughably low.

If they're good developers Core and them will gravitate towards the same position anyway. It's not like Bitcoin can go in 10 radically different directions and still remain Bitcoin. If they're shit devs (like XT, Unlimited, Classic) they're irrelevant anyway (like XT, Unlimited, Classic).

Except that that +52% would not have been there were it not for the efforts of Blockstream (and other core devs). It would likely have been -52%.
So all you need to do to get the same profits (without the $75M cost) is hold some bitcoin and shut the fuck up. Is that too much to ask?
Instead of Ver using his wealth to undermine Bitcoin's value and scam newcomers into scamcoins or temporary Bitcoin pumps, Blockstream actually works hard to increase the utiliity and true value of Bitcoin as a whole. Ver doesn't like that because when Bitcoin grows too big for him to be able to manipulate it, he can't squeeze free profits out of it anymore.

The point is, I can't trust your history if I don't verify it myself. I wouldn't be running a full node.
Not saying your proposal is all bad. It's probably better than running an SPV wallet. And if one only accepts transactions with a few confirmations then you'd be just fine.
But ideally, I want to compare my UTXO set (downloaded from you) to other people's, but without trusting those other people. I don't want to trust random people. However, as I'm already trusting the Proof of Work anyway (after enough confirmations), a UTXO set secured by PoW should do it. UTXO commitments do that and that's being worked on. After that your proposal would be pretty perfectly fine.

I don't claim to "know and have tested bitcoin to support 20GB blocks, let's do it right now, nothing to worry about, trust me" - Gavin 1.5 years ago. Proven flat out bullocks dumb not only by all other efforts at the time but even another idiot like jtoomim a year later, who said 3 maybe 4 mb at the absolute, no safety margin, max.
He might be the greatest most experienced dev ever but he clearly doesn't understand bitcoin and consensus details. The fact that he doesn't have the humility and awareness to recognise about himself, wise hr keeps claiming that he does know what's best (counter ALL other expert opinions) makes him an idiot, yes.
Not to mention the Craig drama. And the hostility with which he attacks the real experts and volunteers doing the actual hard work (note Gavin hasn't contributed a line of code for years!).
Yes clearly pompous idiot and that has nothing to do with name calling.

There is no problem NOW. Relax already.


That's true for any solution. And in fact SW is better than you make it sounds because even clients that have not updated benefit from the larger block size. It's like ablocksize growing gradually: faster when the needs rises.
Either way, it's the only solution that would be possible this fast anyway. A dumb limit increase would take a lot longer. No matter what deceitful and lying classicers say.

Malleability and bidirectional: as far as I understood it was possible to do (almost trustless, minus the last micropayment maybe), but using way clunkier methods.


Yeah that's what I mean when I don't see any applications for one-to-one channels. One that I came up with after posting that was maybe two exchanges that can instantly send bitcoin between each other, but even then you'd quickly want that between 10 exchanges (without locking up funds 10x each).
Your example with locking up funds with an exchange is pretty good I guess. But there too, if you take that first step you really want to take the next step too where you can instantly send your coins to different exchanges while only locking it once. Hence LN.


Interested to hear what problems you have in mind.
I know a town where many (~100) shops accept bitcoin today and it works quite well. Of course everyone knows that coffee payments on chain are not going to last, so this situation will end one way or another. But it does nicely pave the way for LN. Once wallets start supporting LN, all those shops will pretty much automatically switch from onchain to LN and shake off the lingering double spend/0-conf problems they have today.
Yes, real adoption will nevertheless still take a long time.
@_date: 2016-04-11 10:53:19
Yeah actually the article is not too bad and at least well intended. Still wrong on the item that you picked from it. I see spoonxt also confirmed the same thing.
Now what got this thing started was your other post full of typical classic FUD like:


And the whining about a HF and daring to call that uncontentious. Yes an uncontentious HF would be possible next year if it's uncontentious by then. Currently it's not.
And then the personal attacks on the very people that have built bitcoin what it is today, and we depend on to upgrade it for years to come. That would still be ok i guess IF you had shown to be a bigger expert AND contributor, which you clearly aren't.
If you want to learn, you can ask questions. Parroting bs and proclaiming to know better than dozens of experts actually working on the shit, can fuck off.

Nice summary of the state of affairs.
@_date: 2016-04-19 23:20:34


You're going to waste a shitton of people's time and cause frustration (notice how all replies were quite similar to mine) as well as confuse the hell out of other readers that are trying to learn for themselves. And you're not going to get the best answers because the smartest people around are just going to ignore you.
You need to add a lot more question marks and say for example: "I've heard these points before, are they valid?"


So don't forget the question marks then. (Joky)
It's good to be sceptical, but going overboard like a moon hoaxer or flat earther (which is whathas done) will do you (and everyone) more harm than a bit of trust in the people that have put decades of their lives into bitcoin (even before it existed) as well as have kept bitcoin afloat so far, making huge improvements. And that's not trusting a single person, that means trusting the consensus of a large and growing group of individuals of different backgrounds and with different viewpoints.


I'm a dev, although i haven't looked at bitcoin source code much at all, but to me SegWit sounds relatively simple, compared to the rocket science bitcoin development is anyway.
libpsec256k1 sounds a lot trickier to me (and more dangerous in case of bugs). Or the refactoring old code base into libconsensus: scree up one little change in undefined C code and the compiler will cause consensus to break and we're fucked. Of course the devs are smart enough to use (or make) tools and test cases that help ensure all is fine, but still.
Either way, the devs have years of experience now of implementing complex changes at ever increasing pace. If they are in consensus that SegWit is relatively simple and very doable, while the only ones disagreeing are few completely unknown (0 bitcoin experience) devs + gavin who clearly has political and butthurt reasons, then it's pretty easy to pick sides.


True. That's another reason why forums and reddit are quite horrible and tiring: people keep asking the same question and answers quickly disappear from sight (even if not down voted). bitcoin.stackexchange.com should be a lot better for straightforward factual questions and answers (ones that don't need a lot of discussion i guess).

That's what toasters do. That's what light bulbs do. That's what computers do. That's what ASICs do.
Energy is NOT converted into Bitcoins, instead the *VALUE of energy* is converted into the *VALUE of the Bitcoins*. Also pretty much 100% (with some up and down swings over time and minus miner profit).
Value is not a physical quantity, so plugging that into the conservation of energy law is just bullshit.

If you want to talk retard, your comment about email is exactly that. Email is not free, not sending and not receiving. The fact that it doesn't cost you internet dollars is because those don't exist (outside Bitcoin). The fact that some companies provide you with "free" email services, I'll let Ed Snowden explain to you how that works.
More fundamentally: nothing in this world is for free, so stop saying stupid shit.

There's many angles to look at this. One truth is that "USD in" == "USD out", so that huge truck and the trips to vegas are all paid for by others loosing that much money. Other speculators, but eventually other newcomers buying in for the long term. They (probably including me) paid a higher price to fund this guy.
That's cold hard truth. But then you can wonder if Bitcoin wouldn't have had guys like this and the price would have been boringly stable and low for all those years, and most of those newcomers wouldn't have never heard of Bitcoin because it wouldn't have made the news.
But that has both positive and negative sides too. 
And it was probably bound to happen. A stage of assholes any free unregulated market has to go through before it becomes large enough to withstand extreme price manipulation (and the participants wise enough not to fall for it).
So complex...

It's the other way around.
Computers have been great at handling "virtual stuff" for decades. Databases have been great at organizing and storing such "information". Distribution methods aplenty too.
Money is also "information", and in fact those same systems have been used to shuffle money around the world for decades and decades as well. As efficient as politicians and banker-oligopolies have allowed it to become.
The only thing new about Bitcoin/Blockchain/PoW is that now we don't need a central party anymore, or multiple central parties that communicate with each other.
So in your car analogy, it's like we've ripped out the central engine and we installed foot pedals underneath every seat, so occupants can now peddle decentrallized. But that does not make the car into a bicycle or airplane or rocketship. Which is what these blockchain-everything people claim.

@_date: 2016-04-07 13:21:38


Bit more optimistic I'd say it could start at 3 months, but whatever.


I don't see any non-scam alternative with a decent dev team behind it and that doesn't run into the same scaling problems. Bitcoin slow down or complete crash? Sure possible. Getting overtaken? Not realistic.


Hasn't heard that complaint before. Could be an issue I guess.


I think it did in some areas. The wrist is the extra confusion and misinformation that newcomers are getting. Bitcoin isn't easy to begin with and it was already hard to sift through the misinformation, but now there's a shittone more.


Don't really see that. Each update of the last few years has been bigger than the one before. Full of refactorings, cleanups, bug fixes, new features and huge performance and feature enhancements. And a lot of those were preparatory work for blocksize scaling.
Ethereum makes big promises, and as altcoins have proven many times before: big promises of golden unicorns attract ignorant people. I see it as a complete unsustainable joke though.

The fee is there to give you a mechanism to elbow your way to front of the queue in case a bus comes by. A bus will come by no matter what on average every 10 minutes. If there is no queue then you can do a low fee, if there is a huge queue (and you still think your transaction is worth it, then you add a fee so you get nearer the front of the queue.
Blockspace is provided by the bitcoin algorithm: a bus per 10 minutes. Miners are simply guards keeping an eye on the queues making sure freeloaders stay at the back. When a bus happens to come by their stop, they simply load 1MB from the front of the queue and send it off, pocketing the fees. A queue management reward, not a sale of block space.


They don't and can't generate more capacity. Capacity is fixed. That's why they're not selling block space.


Again: you said the same thing about security. Don't be daft.
Ok, especially for you I'll fix the problem ok? If all miners stoo mining i promise i will continue mining. There. Done. 1 block per 10 minutes.

By that logic miners certainly don't provide block space either. Block space is a given and almost constant: 1 per 10 minutes. No matter if an individual miner mines it not.
Miners don't even determine the price per kB really: the market does that. A miner will say simply pick the highest fees transactions available at the time.
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:24:39
It's not a discount in the sense you use it. And it has nothing to do with LN.
It's a fix for something that was crooked from the start, to correctly balance incentives and make fees neutral in the following respect. 
Currenty the byte size of an input is about 4 times larger than an output. That means it's cheaper to get 1 input and create multiple outputs, while it's more expensive to use multiple inputs and 1 output. This means splitting coins (i.e. creating more UTXO data and more dust) is cheaper than combining coins (i.e. reducing UTXO set size and cleaning up dust).
Increase UTXO = cheap.
Decrease UTXO = expensive
That incentivizes waste and therefore unnecessary load on the whole network.
Thanks to SegWit input and outputs will cost the same in fees, balancing the above: Increase and decrease are equaly expensive.
Also: there is nothing mandatory about it. Miners determine the fee they require and they can easily decide not to honer the discount and still charge full fee for SW transactions.
P.S. I know you are a complete troll that has been explained this a million times already and you just don't want to understand the truth and keep parrotting FUD for your own reasons. This post is meant for honest people reading this and getting confused by your nonsense.

I too am against censorship, but can you give broad examples of what you consider censorship? Keep in mind that:
* there's a reason usenet/forums/IRC/reddit are split into topic/channels. I do not consider rejecting off-topic posts as censorship, in fact I am very grateful for the anti-spam filtering that the moderators do.
* The topic here is Bitcoin, that automatically excludes all altcoins.
* You don't expect us to fall for the trick where the trolls come up with some altcoin nonsense but put the label "bitcoin XT/unlimited/classic" on it, in order to get past the moderation?
* I don't consider it a requirement to invite some mob into my house for a cup of tea so they can freely discuss the details on how to rob my place later tonight. And hand them my phone to call my neighbours to deceive them into joining the party. If they want to attack, they can do the preparations on their own platform.
* Seeing as censorship/moderation cannot be zero anyway: kiddy porn, private key stealing malware, doxing, death threats are off limits either way, so at best we're talking about a difference of opinion on the color of a shade of gray.
* The fact that the experts and smart people will be the first to leave and meet/debate each other elsewhere (possibly behind closed doors) as soon as the current place turns into a cesspool. For me those experts are the main reason I even come here: because I want to learn and keep informed of the latest developments. And it's also a weapon that we shouldn't give trolls: the ability to censor experts and stifle honest debate.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:47:44


That's very true and one of the reasons Core devs don't want to just raise the block size. It's certainly not the most important reason, but this just proves that it certainly counts.
A few techy nerds may shout "a 2 TB harddisk and a decent PC and internet connection cost almost nothing", but if reality is that nobody will go to the trouble of setting up such a system then it doesn't matter what arguments they have: people just don't do it. Wouldn't be the first time techy nerds get things wrong on what people want or are willing to do. How many times have you told your family members not to reuse password for different online accounts?
And people not doing it makes Bitcoin moot and we might as well quit the whole thing now.

That however is no argument that devs and teams and dev-consensus are useless.

Yet he proposed 20GB. Exactly my point.
Also: only safe after scaling solutions like libsecp256k1 and n^2 hashing foxes and segwit. None of which were made our even suggested by him, in fact they're diminished to nice to have but not necessary. Talk of ignorance.
Everyone pointed out scaling problems 5 years ago. Many people actually worked on fixes all that time (see above and plenty more: headers first, pruning). Gavin was just a source of noise and confusion that has resulted in a lot of noobs and ill-informed and trolls (one or more apply to you) to not understand the issues and thinking a doubling is easy.

Next time please also ask him about his bitcoin in space program. I donated cause of the cool factor, although the need always seemed far fetched (or at least premature) to me.
I don't think it was a scam, nor do i want my money back out anything. But if like to hear a bit of his side of the story and why it was mothballed.
Also one question relating to block size: how much scale would those satellites have supported? Storage, but more importantly bandwidth and cpu, constrained as they are.

What the hell is "light mode"? Don't tell me classic came uo with more empty promises?
Light mode is on its way in core, one of yhr steps being segwit which will allow fraud proofs. That will allow a light client to be really SPV as Satoshi described in his white paper and not have to download and validate everything to still get almost all of the benefits of the blockchain + a 99.999...% certainty about the rest.
Other big steps towards a light client are pruning and segwit itself allowing separate downloading of transactions and signatures. All invented and implanted by core devs btw.

That is PRECISELY the sort false and utterly STUPID information I was talking about. Thank you for proving my point exactly. Now take a few months of just reading true information and asking honest questions instead of parroting crap you picked up at a dirty street corner (i.e. Prove that the above is bullshit?
BECAUSE YOU CREATE THE ADDRESS WHERE YOU WANT TO RECEIVE FUNDS YOURSELF! You decide where you want to receive money! Why the FUCK would you create a segwit address if you don't support receiving money on it?? You fucking even couldn't if you wanted to fcol.

Half of the people on that list were on there without actually having been asked for their opinion and it took them several repeated public requests to be taken off the list for that to finally happen.
You're defending liars and cheaters as well as incompetent developers, trolls and outright scammers. Just open your eyes to the amount of work core is doing and the amount of transaction capacity increase planned for the coming 2 years and all you need to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:58:42
Yeah 10000 inputs from the same address. Address reuse mayhem. (As if 10000 is anywhere near realistic.)
Again: way more than 30%. 
Conspiracy bullshit. Most core devs are not blockstream and most ideas are from before blockstream even existed.
Xthin is an extremely stupid thing. It was an ideas years old, but obsoleted by much better ideas years ago as well. The fact the morons even started implementing it is baffling. Then when they made it they oversold it by lying with the statistics and still didn't understand that it was shit.
Proof: latest IRC logs. Bluematt implemented a proper actual solution. XT/classic devs had a chance there to further Bitcoin and actually do something useful but they proved themselves unqualified and too stubborn to listen to people that know their shit (and actually came up with the different ideas in the first place), so instead they ended up wasting everyone's time and adding to the classic FUD list.


I said incentivize. Sorry for using complex words for your simple mind. It means there will be a good reason for it becoming more popular.
Anyway. I've already proved literally every sentence of yours false if not outright bullshit but instead of understanding you just keep coming up with more. Typical troll tactics. You can just stay in your own little world where your the one who's right. In any normal world you're not.

Good write up I'd say (IAmNotACoreDev), albeit meta and not explaining so much what MAST does.


Except this particular idea is already 4-5 years old, but didn't have any practical way of being implemented before SegWit. It could have been implemented and experimented on in an altcoin, but I guess this once again proves the dev skill levels and priorities of altcoiners.

3 counts of completely failing to understand how open source (and development in general) works in one sentence.
You are not their boss. You're not even their customer. They don't work for you. They're not getting paid. If you don't like the product there's a money back guarantee.
That you dare use the word "should" is very telling.
How much time have you personally put into bitcoin development, or paid someone else to do it?
Anyway, the people working on LN are completely separate groups of people. No time is taken away from bitcoin development. So don't worry.
The inventors of side chains themselves have said that they don't really provide scaling. It's very questionable to assume much scaling (let alone infinite) from sidechains.

There's different levels of consensus, mister. Bitcoin mining lets nodes reach consensus on the blockchain state, they use hardcoded rules to do that.
Consensus on what those rules are is a whole different level. Every node needs to run the same rules i.e. there needs to be consensus on the rules. Node operators chose the rules, but they run code written by devs so in the end, if the rules need to be changed you need devs to agree (i.e. be in consensus).
From the context (we were talking about team of developers) it was clear that the type of consensus I was talking about was developer-consensus.

True. But if, at a traffic stop, a cop needs a mere speckle of marijuana to taint your whole car AND you enough to throw you in jail for a few years... It all depends on what rules make that 1/8th and what consequences are associated with such value.


Very much agreed. But that depends on not having politicians doing the above. It would be awesome if we can strengthen fungibility and/or make it harder/impossible for such politicians to even begin to imagine a prohibition.

I agree with your general optimism, however I find payment channels becoming popular before LN quite unlikely:
Payment channels have been possible (albetit a bit clunkier) for years now. The only thing ever that used it was Streamium as a proof of concept of something everyone as always used as an example: pay-per-second video. I don't see any applications (plus all wallets start supporting payment channels) pop up between now and half a year that will suddenly be all the rage.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:04:13
You're just making a huge fool out of yourself, just so you know. You probably get upvoted for such baseless cluelessness among other fools in but as soon as the IQ goes over that of a tomato, that doesn't work anymore.
Facts: wallets that don't warn for 0-conf transactions that are not crystal perfectly clear standard and including plenty fee, are just plain bad wallets. Complain to their devs for making shit all these years and not checking even the most basic simple things. Thank Todd for (again) pointing out flaws.
0-Conf is highly dangerous anyway and no matter how embedded is use is despite warnings by devs to not to: it may never impede the development of Bitcoin. It's already hard enough to make updates to Bitcoin, if we also have to take braindead use cases into account by staying backward compatible with them, that will just hinder progress and is not acceptable.
@_date: 2016-04-19 11:42:16
The fact that you're mixing betting about the minute details of the timeline and saying "the path is wrong" (and that other bs after that) just shows that you're butthurt and want to cause as much drama as you still can. Too bad you can't anymore.
Regarding the bet: it's roughly the timeline I said (a month) and it depends on external factors, so noone can ever be exactly sure. On the other hand, noone gives a fuck whether it's a week later or even a month later. So no I won't bet, it's not even worth thinking about a bet. It's not important.
Regarding the rest of your post: just grow up. Many many people that know what they are doing are in consensus (and none are against!). You better assume they are right or just sell your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:25:49
Seggregated Wittness, Lightning Network, Schnorr signatures, Signature Aggregation, MAST, Confidential Transactions, sidechains, a hard fork that increases block the size limit.
CT will not do scaling in transaction capacity wise, but it will increase privacy and censorship resistence (different kind and actually more important scaling). Most of the above solutions also improve privacy/censorship resistence btw (besides scaling the transaction capacity).
All being worked on. Exciting stuff for the coming 2 years or so.

Shows that you have a lot to learn on how Bitcoin works and what "trustless" means. Because the answer is actually quite logical once you know.
One way to learn is to try and play, so please go ahead with another wallet. Or you could have run a pruning node, using the pruning configuration setting. Maybe someday.
Anyway, welcome to Bitcoin! Hold your own private keys, or the coins are not yours.

You're not listening, nor show any willingness to learn. You're just violently in denial.
I never implied any of that. You can do 0 conf all you want all day long. Just don't blame RBF or Todd or Core for something you should have known already because everyone has said so since 0conf was first done: it's dangerous, so you need external methods to protect yourself: camera, trust, face to face, whatever.
@_date: 2016-04-25 16:15:49


Actually, coins are perfectly distinguishable, even on the same address. They're still distinct coins. You can separately see them "entering" or "exiting" an address. The fact that they're on the same address only provides extra meta information in that they both belong to the same owner.
(Disclaimer: there actually are no coins at all, but since it makes talking about it a bit easier it's ok to pretend sometimes.)

It's certainly possible. Greg recently did it to shut up some bigblock FUDders. Even further back than anyone with a right mind would want to.

A 1000 factors influence the profitability of pools, I trust you when you say the payout to a miner is significantly different and not always higher for larger pools.
All I'm saying is that larger pools have lower orphan rates, which is only 1 of those 1000 factors, but it is an advantage that apparently not all large pools share with their miners. I guess the operators pocket that money then.
The next thing I'm wondering is why do miners join those large pools if it's not for the money? Were they lazy and simply didn't compare? You don't expect people that spend serious money on it to be lazy.

Dude you're doing yourself such a disservice by listening to dumbfucks on and then parrotting their bullshit. You clearly have no clue how this stuff works, but you copy an opinion from whoever and then spout that as truth.
It would be a whole different story if you just came in here and asked a few polite questions and people would explain it. If you then still don't understand, you'll just have to trust someone: but who to trust is a very important decision so you better stay away from the crazies. Hint: The crazies are usually the ones that promise good things (golden rainbows, no problems, easy, ...) and blame the bad things on others (often with conspiracy theories).
Either way, if you get your information from "someone you trust" instead of understanding it yourself, it's really stupid to start spreading that information as if it's eternal truth. You really want to stay flexible with who you trust and change your trust if you run into someone better. What if you picked the wrong person to trust? What if they turned out to be wrong anyway? What if what they said was perfectly correct but you (because you don't fully understand) are misquoting them or applying their logic where it doesn't apply?
There's a million ways you can turn out to be a complete ass. Which you are here. Instead: asking honest questions and then doing something with the explanation (i.e. learn) is a lot safer.


There's no central party that can decide that. You can only decide the minimum you want to accept for yourself. 0, 1, 2 or 6 or 100. Depends on context, value and your own paranoia.
Whatever number you pick, there's always a danger. The idea of how Bitcoin works, with the chaining and PoW, is that the danger goes down exponentially. It's like throwing dice: if you throw all sixes you lose the money. How many sixes in a row would make you feel comfortable? 6 sixes in a row is pretty safe. 1 hmm... maybe only if you trust the other person. 0 is completely different case: there are no dice at all.
Hint: the difference between 0conf and 1conf is completely unrelated to the difference between 1conf and 2conf.


if(tx.Fee &gt;= MinimumFee &amp;&amp; TxLooksCompletelyNormal(tx) &amp;&amp; AllInputsConfirmed(tx)) { "you're received a transaction!" } else { "nothing" }
If the wallet didn't have something like the above in it, it was stupid and dangerous from the beginning. If RBF is not caught by the TxLooksCompletelyNormal check, then it's one easy change and done.
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:13:05
I'll stick to the 1.8 estimate I've seen most people make, but whatever 1.7 or 1.8 who gives a fuck? Multisig use is likely to rise anyway.
The biggest effect will happen soon after activation: most wallets  and tranaction heavy companies are already ready for it. Then it will trickle further towards the 1.8x, why would anyone care how long that would take: if blockspace is scarce it will speed up, if not noone gives a fuck. It's like having a dynamic auto adjusting-to-demand  blocksize, just like everyone wanted.
Yeah, I'd say a year after is "soon". Maybe we'll even get MAST in the meantime which will cut transaction sizes a little. But whatever maybe not that soon.
So future is bright. Doubling next few months and doubling next year. Plus possibly MAST and/or Signature Aggregation to reduce transaction sizes. That's already close to the 2-4-8 proposals of a few months ago.
On top of that we'll get the n orders of magnitude scaling from LN. I have no idea what to estimate for that on what time scales, but 10x and 100x seem fairly possible in a similar timeframe we're taking about above.
And that's looking only at the relatively boring and unimportant transaction throughput numbers. SegWit and LN (and MAST and AS) bring so much more to the table in terms of fixing long-standing bugs and adding security and features.
The future is bright for Bitcoin. The debate took a while, but thanks to the unrelenting hard work of devs in and despite of the debate, Bitcoin is steaming ahead ever faster and stronger.
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:47:57
Oh now you say you are merely trying to understand?
Before you were saying


Which didn't include a question mark because it's a statement. A statement worded such that it sounds like you know what you're talking about and researched the topic at hand.
So you didn't then? You meant to add a question mark, but you just forgot?
Yet instead of the question mark you added a list of standard debunked items from troll checklist, that again are only there to confuse the hell out of people that actually don't know but are honestly trying to learn. Which is the target audience of trolls: feed FUD to the ignorant newbies so they can further parrot that misinformation to others.
Ok, so let's assume you're not a troll but a victim of one, as described above.
In that case, i apologise for jumping to that conclusion. I hope you can see how i did that and how you can avoid such reactions in the future.

Enjoy the many rabbit holes to come!
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:43:55


I saw you did in other posts. Whole different tone of questions, and I think you'll agree that it resulted in much better answers (more useful for you and 3rd party readers, as well more friendly). So thank you for changing your tone.
And again apologies for jumping to the troll conclusion. It's hard to keep track of known-trolls and new names. Everyone deserves a few chances.
Regarding the censorship: in my view the level of censorship is way overblown. Most are just off topic or annoying trolls that get deleted or banned. But more importantly: it's not the Core devs that are doing the "censoring". Forum mods are independant individuals with their own rules and judgements (whether you agree with those or not, there will always be some rules on any forum). But it shouldn't reflect on the devs themselves. Most of them hardly visit and some do, but just to answer questions and explain stuff using facts.
As for classic: those numbers are overblown too. Most of those nodes are fake, just set up by a few individuals within a week on one or two cloud providers. As for the community size they just make a lot of noise, but it's not really that many people. Nor hardly anyone "known" (i.e. done anything worthwhile for bitcoin in the past). Any community has some sheep that follow whatever some popular person says without understanding. I'm (gladly) surprised it's not more than 5% tbh.
Yes, Gavin (and Jeff) are different. But Gavin has proven himself wrong so often and so badly now, that noone takes his take on blocksize serious anymore. Remember he started out claiming: "I've tested 20GB blocks, everything's fine, let's do it, trust me". After several iterations of downsized proposals (all proven wrong) we finally got some "scientific" data from the classic camp (jtoomim) that said 2MB maaybe 3MB max. (for now). And the fact that that's even possible at all is only thanks to all the hard work of Core devs over the last x years: libpsec256k, headers first, all kinds of other optimizations in caching and storage and communication plus Matt's Relay Network.
Well, let's not repeat the whole block size discussion here :)
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:57:04
Hmm. Weird. Doesn't sound very likely that so many people spend tens and hundreds of $ 1000s on equipment but then don't take a few hours to pick the best pool. And if they really are that lazy they end up with a pool on the other side of the world: high latency (even just chinese websites are often hardly reachable, let alone worry about latency and unreliability in mining) and if the Chinese pool operator turns out to do an exit scam then there's no courts you can go to. 
I kind of doubt that.
Is it because they assume it will keep them hidden from the IRS and other authorities maybe?
Or is it because of the centralisation pressure that mining inherently has: larger pools are slightly more profitable on the long run?
@_date: 2016-04-19 11:32:55
I used to think a bit of pressure was good and that he was doing a good job. Since about a year though, it's clear that he's just being dishonest, not understanding and pushing his own agenda. As well as just being toxic to the community.
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:11:32
Clearly you've put more actual thought and design into it than I ever have. So again, no disrespect :)
The gun to the head is still an important problem as you say. And I wonder if you actually need a blockchain or that some simpler immutable data structure (with hashes/encryption) would suffice. I don't see what "transactions" exactly are or what use the tokens would be. Nor do "blocks" make much sense if you don't have PoW anyway.
Open to being proven wrong, but I've seen posts by I think GMaxwell and sipa and maybe others on the topic of voting+blockchains and those posts made a lot of sense.
Especially on the overlap of 2 worlds full of promises but few real results (electronic voting and blockchains), I prefer the wait and see approach.
@_date: 2016-04-15 01:32:28
Of course it's not free. You pay for that one way or there other.
Bitcoin is boring and unnecessary for most "respectable people with a steady job and a house in a Western country where police and courts are on stand by to enforce the law". You just said it yourself: those people think credit cards are free money and way easier.
Bitcoin is way more useful for the unbanked and underserviced. They can't get a bank account let alone a credit card.
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:31:00
So why is he actively working against core then? Core has scaling next month. Core has 6x scaling this + next year (without counting LN). Classic has nothing. Not even a proposal or per reviewed and tested proper code. Nothing. Not even dreams for more than 2x. Nothing.

Noo dude... You got that all wrong. Probably misled by misquotes and lying headlines.
He was just playing what if games. Thought experiments. Possible solutions to what others were claiming would be a disastrous event. A scientist can do that: assume a position (no matter how unlikely or impossible) and start reasoning from there. Sometimes you end up finding something extremely weird, sometimes you end up proving the assumed position was really impossible, usually it gets you nowhere other than an interesting fun thought experiment.
Either way, then the trolls misquote you and half a year later your still getting nagged about it.

There's no way in hell they can ever get LN working on bcash: they ripped out SegWit.
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:46:11
Which they are getting. From core. And a shitton more actually.  (6x in about 2 years, beside all the real performance and feature improvements). So classic and especially Gavin can quit whining about it already. Getting extremely tiring walking around with a bunch of 3 year olds that keep crying for ice scream even while we're already walking in the direction of the ice cream parler.

Never said 0conf not allowed or not useful in cases. I Said it's dangerous. And if RBF requires a small change in your wallet software to not be brain-dead, then that's just proof of the software having been brain-dead before already. We're not stopping progress in Bitcoin in general just because there happen to be brain-dead pieces of software out there that can't deal with it.
Other than that you can do whatever you want with 0conf and nothing has changed because of RBF so stop trying to blame RBF or Todd or Core. Bring your whining elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-04-02 15:57:41
Cause you have no clue what scaling means.
This IS scaling because it makes the software more efficient immediately as well as opening up many future paths to further scaling scaling solutions. For example Aggregated Signatures (40% decrease of transaction size), or fraud proofs that allow light clients with way better security that current SPV, or a safer block size limit increase. And plenty more.
Changing a constant is not scaling.
At the same time it also scales the transaction throughout by 1.8x.

They will be by updated nodes, but to them they're not anyonecanspend because they understand the rules. Only old nodes see them as anyonecanspend, but won't relay them as they're not standard (and obvipusly weird).

In general in Open Source something is ready when it's ready and there's no point in asking "are we there yet?" every day. Not saying he is doing that, but in aggregate devs generally ignore those questions because it drives them nuts.
In this surviving case he was given a rough time frame: "sometime this summer" and there's no point in asking any more specific let alone an exact date that has nothing to do with LN whatsoever.
Sure he can ask, but my question is at least as valid.
@_date: 2016-04-15 18:57:43
Why? Are you counting the advantages of SegWit in your argument against SegWit?
@_date: 2016-04-15 00:20:39
Yeah well we all know credit cards are not THAT great either. It's not free money for a month. If you pay me enough and i have enough guarantee that I'm gonna get my money back i could give you bitcoins for a month or let you use my LN channel for a few weeks. Unfortunately that doesn't really work in a trustless way, so that only works for respectable people with a steady job and a house in a Western country where police and courts are on stand by to enforce the law.
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:02:18


Not really. Just "locked" in a multisig+timelock transaction.


No, not really. But you can run an LN node and establish payment channels and receive income from fees.
@_date: 2016-04-13 23:17:33
Bullshit you can receive as much as people will send you. You can only send as much as you've put into the channels (or received from others).
But sure, just because you can't send a million $ every 10 seconds that must mean the whole system is useless.
Have any more bullshit FUD ti get out of your system?
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:13:26
First of all: the post i responded to said decentralisation was going to die completely. Even a slight increase in centralisation would still debunk that.
But i do think it actually does increase decentralisation because it allows LN nodes to earn some money. Larger LN nodes with significant money at stake would likely run a full bitcoin node. Full bitcoin nodes are one of the pillars of Bitcoins decentralisation.
LN also increases privacy and makes it harder to censor payments.
LN itself a decentralised system and it doesn't affect the centralisation of Bitcoins itself.

@_date: 2016-04-08 12:12:49
Disclaimer (again): I am not a core dev (or even a bitcoin dev). All my own opinion.


I really don't see how any of that changes anything about rights to demand anything from anyone. Still doesn't change the fact that devs are doing what they enjoy doing (and what they are best in) in their own free time.
It's up to the community to pay for (and to organize) anything that isn't done already by the volunteers. Core are part of that community and they are in fact taking a lot of that onto their shoulders now, but it still doesn't really make sense that they *have* to.
That's part of the deal for everyone that came into Bitcoin: it's not a centrally run company with a helpdesk and refund window. It's open source and fundamentally you're entirely on your own. You can hire your own specialists to guide you through if necessary.
Of course in practice the situation is a lot better than that and devs and other volunteers do actually help people and write documentation and organize stuff. Partly because an open source project with 0 users is also no fun. But that's all a bonus and not a fundamental right that the universe handed out. Synergetic relationships with wallet makers and payment processors are just that: synergetic: both sides win and if the relationship gets disturbed both sides lose (a little), but that's about all the leverage you have, anything more that you get is bonus.


Lucky for you, glad you have. But that doesn't give you any inherent right to make more money tomorrow. Every day is a new one.
The above I describe in how far people have rights to expect something from others: which is almost nothing. And that makes it sound like open source is evil and wild wild west. Although of course if a central company goes bankrupt you're just as fucked (if not more), so that's not really the difference.
The funny thing, is that open source actually does give you some extra rights and that is to go do it yourself if you don't agree with the main devs. In Bitcoin this is actually harder than in "normal" open source projects because here you'll have to persuade a major majority of the community to follow your version instead of the status quo. But that too is a benefit because it guarantees more stability, which is definitely needed for a money to have value (trust that some devs are not going to uproot all fundamentals tomorrow). So it's not so much the devs themselves that guarantee you anything or give you rights to demand anything: you can draw reasonable expectations from this interplay of being open source yet long term stable. And since devs realize this and are in it for mostly the same goals anyway, this becomes a self reenforcing cycle. (Until people like Gavin start tearing that apart with contentious hard forks.)
In short: the fact that a demand was met yesterday (a question was answered, a feature was changed to align with your view) doesn't mean you actually had a right to even demand it. It just happened to be in mutual benefit of all parties involved.

@_date: 2016-04-11 02:01:18
Yeah real honest reply... I could have said the same about your dumb post: security without miners, that defies reality.
I said by that logic, i.e. using the same assumptions you made. Glad you could shoot holes in your own logic.
No they are not sellers of space, space comes whether they find a block or not. They can slightly influence the confirmation speed of individual transactions, but most will eventually settle on some algorithm that maximised their income i.e. just pick the highest per kB fees. By then the price is completely determined by the market i.e. f if your neighbours are sending higher fee transactions they will go into blocks earlier.
@_date: 2016-04-05 08:54:48
All bs again.
You think it's thought experiment and it won't be implemented, you have not a single argument to back that up.
It definitely looks like it will be implemented sooner rather than later: in fact most of it HAS already been implemented (see BIP). Details will take some time as well as planning a rollout etc. but even that should be fairly simple with BIP9 noe implemented.
It will make a nice (small) positive difference in scaling and privacy, which is exactly what we need (privacy more than scaling). With no downsides whatsoever as far as I've seen so far.
You can stick your head back in the sand now.
@_date: 2016-04-13 11:10:20
Keep moving the goal posts dude... We were talking about partitioning.  I'll just assume you conceded that point then.

Core has 6x scaling (on chain, not counting LN) in the pipeline for this and next year. Classic has absolutely nothing.
Now who's the dumb fuck slowing down true growth eh?
@_date: 2016-04-02 00:01:26
I literally haven't seen a sentence of yours that makes sense. Had enough. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 17:16:36
Well, impossible wasn't proven (unfortunately) but what was proven is that it's a lot harder and requires more than a pretty face and hollow pie in the sky promises. Thankfully the community was level headed enough to reject it, but it's important that the community (economic users) act the same next time someone (Gavin) tries. I'm optimistic as growth of number of people as well as growing economic interests (rising price) should make people more cautious, careful and conservative.
There are also technical improvements possible (and in the works) to make contentious hard (or soft) forks harder: SPV clients need to start checking more. Currently SPV clients blindly follow whatever longest chain they can find (note: one of the "benefits" of a hard fork touted by the classic hostile takeover gang) and hardly check anything (except for transactions destined to themselves). More checks as well as accepting Fraud Proofs from other nodes where local checks are not possible, should improve that situation a lot. So SPV nodes won't blindly follow some random hard fork without the owner actually making a choice.
More economic power forced to make an active choice instead of unknowingly being suckered into an update strengthens the situation.

@_date: 2016-04-14 10:14:57


And that's exactly what LN allows you to do: get the growth of Bitcoin plus earn some money on fees.
I bet even smart people lock up some cash in their wallets. That was what I was saying: no matter where you park your money it's always going to be "locked up" in some sense. Duration and flexibility and earned interest and paid costs make the difference, but those are different for individuals and circumstances and different throughout time.
When all shops in the real and virtual world accept LN payments then everything other than having money in LN would be called "locked up".
@_date: 2016-04-07 21:45:19


Don't worry about my karma, I don't. :) Was just saying seemed like a decent mostly factual conversation we were having but apparently worthy of down votes nonetheless.


OK. I interpreted another "stalled". With 1.8x and 2.0x coming up, send like it's growing more than the 2 years prior, so not sure i agree with stalled. And that's ignoring LN, MAST and SA.


Ok, another misinterpretation of mine then. And another point i don't entirely agree with, although I've heard it before. But i admit that might be because it takes a nerd to recognise (as in appreciate) a nerd. They seemed to be accessible and speaking to me very clearly.
You're probably right regarding many others (i guess), but for me, no.


For example, Bitcoin Core does not have any members that perform management tasks like maintaining communication channels with various shareholders in the ecosystem (payment processors, miners, wallets, merchants, users, etc.).
I guess that's being worked on now and has improved then since this sort of criticism has come up. Personally i don't really give a fuck tbh. Core is not a company with a budget for all that, not it's that the open source way of doing things anyway.


Wiki, website, documentation and forum posts explaining things were improving at a rapid pace (among others by if I'm not mistaken) before that criticism was even raised. All in much better condition than probably any other young in high flux open source project. Developers were all very accessible through many forums and IRC and even in person on meetups. And again they don't owe anything to anyone. It's open source, it's their own free time, not being paid, not a company.


Then they should do it themselves or pay for it. Open Source. WYSIWYG and if it's not enough they can fuck off. (My opinion, apparently not the Core opinion as change is underway, as you say next.)


I'm not sure that i think it's fair that it falls on their shoulders where some would better spend their time on what comes natural to them: hard core devving. But I do see that it has advantages for sure.
Still think ignoramas have zero right to demand anything. If they don't like it they can get their money back (whatever they paid for the software) and fuck off. If they don't like something now they can try their luck elsewhere (in fantasialand which will crumble soon anyway) our just wait a few more years for this role thing to mature. Maybe by then it will be more understandable and useful to them. The universe owes them nothing.

Correction: gavin has ben lying+deceitful for more than a year now. "Trust me, i tested it, bitcoin can easily handle 8GB." (Oops, i guess not: sssh don't say anything, quick throw another one out to distract.) "Trust me, tested. 20MB!" ... "8MB" ... "Unlimited" ... "2MB". 
Note that bitcoin with 20GB ( + growing rediculously) would be dead by now according to even jtoomims data (his own buddy).
No wonder no one takes him serious anymore.


Demand for cheap eternal storage+distribution is infinite. The only thing that hat hold that back now is the threat that it won't be cheap forever.


All at the same time, which takes consensus and then coordination and preparation, i.e. long time. And any node that doesn't get updated is left vulnerable.


Not all. Not at the same time. However, all major wallets already have updates ready right now. And wallets not updated are left as secure as they were before.


How about that is technically I'm impossible? Rolling out more than one softfork at the same time will only become possible in the upcoming version. A HF now would waste a year of valuable actual scaling in improvements and upgrades.

Well, I can imagine as a mining pool one is constantly looking over ones shoulder at what other miners are doing. "If one crosses the dam, maybe it's best to follow." A list like this might help to reassure each other that level headed people have thought about it and are staying on the right side of the dam.
Of course they can lie or change their mind or be forced to at some point, so certainly no guarantee or anything like that. But a nice statement as sign of healthy brains nonetheless.

ok yeah you still need the references. Principle problem: wildcards shift the work of scanning for those transactions to ALL nodes in the world. If it's your money, you better do the work and hand all the details needed to find and verify the inputs.
Huge problem remains: address reuse. Yes that is bad. Very bad. No matter if you're sending or receiving. Everyone suffers in privacy.
Yeah best case scenario is better (in bytes), but hugely unlikely to happen often. And normal-case situations will be handled by Schnorr+SA just as well. Without the cost in privacy.
People doing on chain microtransactions (especially with the same address) are complete idiots and don't need an extra push to do it even more.
@_date: 2016-04-05 08:43:13
You mean Schnorr signatures are slower to calculate/verify? Other than that i only see benefits for performance and scaling (smaller transactions).

Because there's no incentive for miners to work on the next block. They're better off trying to redo the previous block to get the fees in there.

This is part of what will create a true competitive (yet symbiotic), evolutionary (instead of revolutionary) and free choice environment that will allow Bitcoin to improve and adapt. As opposed to the political out of consensus altcoin attacks like classic/xt and the rest.
Another step in that direction is libconsensus that allows completely independent yet compatible implementations with only that minimised library as common code.

@_date: 2018-01-28 15:20:07
Yeah, I've heard the argument and I see the logic. Not sure I agree with it. I also think the kind of insider trading he was talking about was employees (high up or not) of those companies trading with better knowledge of how well/bad things are going with the company.
The kind of insider trading we're talking about when we mention Ver and Bcash is the fundamentally worthless tokens having been created out of thin air, pumped with lies and false promises and then surprise released specifically timed by the exchange itself, to coincide with coordinated spam and DOS attacks.
And again I'm willing to agree that all that isn't illegal and should be fine in a permissionless trustless unregulated system. But (1) that doesn't make Ver and coinbase any less than pure scumbags. I personally didn't expect anything less of them and haven't lost a penny because of it. But (2) I'm sure a lot of people have and because that money went to these assholes, who are now funded even better to do yet another attack on Bitcoin, making things worse for everybody.
And then even if we agree to the unregulation of insider trading, it's still not fully unregulated: if it were, there would be (class action) death squads hunting down Roger right now. And Roger's troll armies would be actually armed.
Many sides to this story, even if you fully agree with either Milton Friedman.

If the mempool is empty miners have 0 incentive to mine. So they shut off or they start trying to hijack the previous block so maybe they can steal the fee that were in there.
Also, when block space supply is abundant (i.e. empty pool) then price (fee) goes to 0, thus there is nobody paying for security, thus bitcoin fails.
Mempool is not just a queue, it's more like an order book on an exchange. People bidding on block space.

Look up some nullc posts on flextrans if you want to learn the endless factual technical flaws in it.

@_date: 2018-01-12 01:03:26
No, more than 2MB.


Then go use SegWit and tell shitty bigblockers like coinbase to get their shit together. Quit bothering the devs, they've already done their job 1.5 years ago and they are working on further and better improvements anyway.
Also, if you want something, go do it yourself and quit being a whining baby demanding free icecream.


Who gives a fuck? Did you do ANYTHING to further its progress? Did you pay for its development? Did you design it? Did you discuss the engineering details on the mailing list? Did you do any testing? Bug reports? Logo designs? Did you at least bring around coffee and do the dishes while the grownups were working on it?
No, that's what I thought.


AND you have no clue what you're talking about, so why would anybody care what you think should be the right block size? You think you're the first person to come up with a random number these last 5 years?
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:51:21
Right now miners certainly do NOT have full power on whether or how to scale. So you're talking bollocks there. 
In fact, if USERS are persistent and in full consensus, miners have no power at all: they are hired by users, so they can suck on monopoly money if they don't do what users want. That's why it's so dangerous what classic and others are doing: driving wedges in between and confusing the hell out of users and miners, to make it seem there is no consensus and make users less persistent. All in an effort to do a hostile takeover with a small majority.


Miners can put as much junk in blocks as they want, for free! There is no way to measure "needs of the network". So you're talking bollocks again.
In Bitcoin things work often exactly reversed from what they seem at first sight. That's why it's so easy forpoliticians and scammers like classic to persuade ignoramas: "We'll just do this and it will all be fixed, done. Don't believe the experts that have been discussing this for 3+ years now."

Most podcasts these days I listen at 1.5x speed, but Bitcoin Uncensored often needs to go down to 1.1x or this last episode even to 1x as I found it too interesting to miss words.

Yeah sounds like it makes sense. I used to be of the opinion that touching any shitcoin is just bad, but especially since dumping all this shitforks I can see how extracting money from those scams is probably the best thing to do to help them die more quickly and ultimately scam fewer people. Dumb money must go somewhere, better to BTC than to some scammer's pockets.

Probably because you're parroting unfounded rbtc FUD.
@_date: 2016-04-24 01:42:58


 False. Shitloads of normal transactions have more than one input, which means they have more than one signature. Thus big savings.
It also incentives CoinJoin to get even more signature into the one transactions and save even more bytes (plus increasing privacy).


Dumbest argument ever. You claim (whine and cry) blocksize is hugely important. Yet noone will implement a simple change to halve the transaction size. So therefore we might as well not do it.
And of course the whole world is still driving Ford model T's, why upgrade to a better car model?


Butthurt whining. Just admit you were rooting for dumb shits that were wrong from the start and you were and are very wrong about it. You don't understand any of the issues. So just shut up.
And then realised that SegWit will increase the block size (yes for everyone, direct effect) next month or 2 (faster than anything else possibly could). So you're getting what you want anyway. And after SegWit the other ideas mentioned here will again increase capacity (for everyone, direct effect). And then there's a hard fork on the road map as well.
So what the fuck are you actually complaining about. It's fuckjng free, you don't have to do shit and you get what you want but for some reason your crying like a baby.
Fuck off already.

There was a Ripple before the current Ripple-altcoin bought that name and replaced the whole thing with their own scamcoin. Ripple used to have a good name (and be a decent system, albeit not decentralized like Bitcoin), now the name is just a label for yet another shitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-04 21:42:18
Except block size has shit to do with difficulty.
The nearest link is that fees (both in USD and in BTC) are now higher than they were at first halvening both absolutely and relatively. All of which make this halvening a shitload LESS scary than the first one, if it has anything to do with transactions.

@_date: 2016-04-26 20:36:19
I'm glad you're asking for "SAFE", because protecting the properties, that make Bitcoin be Bitcoin and not Paypal, is more important than the exact blocksize.
Of the technologies I mentioned before, SegWit + Schnorr + SA + MAST combined allow for about 6x transaction capacity increase (if I'm not mistaken and depending on what type of transactions are popular by that time). That is achieved by actually making the transactions smaller instead of blocks larger, but let's be fair and agree that's equivalent.
Then there will be the hard fork, I guess it completely depends on what devs regard as safe by that time (after above and many other improvements that make it safer to grow). Let's be conservative for now and keep that at 2x.
So rough fairly conservative estimate(*) : 12x in two to three years. I'm not even counting the reduction in number of transactions that LN could cause. If LN takes away half of the normal Bitcoin transactions, then you could count that as another doubling.
Now to your question.
First question yourself why you would want that. Why do you want unlimited blocksize? Why must it all be on one layer?
Who says unlimited is better than some value X (possibly growing over time) ? Considering there's always going to be some small cost to bandwidth and storage, it seems obvious that (small) * (unlimited) equals (a shitload of money), for ALL nodes on the network. That doesn't sound so great. 
Also what more can you as a normal user do with "unlimited" instead of a "big enough" X? Upload your baby home videos? Star Wars Bluerays? Backup your whole PC? Why?
Whether possible or not, unlimited seems pretty pointless tbh. As far as I know "unlimited" is not possible yet in a "SAFE and workable" manner and likely never will be. Aiming for "big enough" sounds a lot smarter. Whether that is doable in a "SAFE and workable" manner remains to be seen, but I'd say that's everyone's goal.
So why one layer? To start with: let's say your neighbour does like Lightning Network and because he uses it a lot, he hardly makes any layer 1 transactions anymore. That means you now have extra space for your transactions that wasn't there before and you don't have to give up anything or do anything different. So even if you don't want to use extra layers, you sure as hell do want the extra space, so you better encourage everyone else to do use those other layers.
The next thing is considering that each off-chain tech will be different. Some you may not like, some you may like, some you may like only under certain circumstances. It would be stupid to dismiss them all (even before they're invented).
Then more specifically Lightning Network.
Think for a second about the reason Bitcoin has a blockchain to begin with: The only reason(**) Bitcoin needs a blockchain at all is to prevent people from cheating each other by double spending. Remember that other ways of cheating (malleability) will have been solved by SegWit soon or are simply impossible thanks to cryptography. If users were somehow prevented from double spending, we wouldn't need blockchains at all. No blocks (no blocksize debate) and no chain (no on/off-chain debate). People can just hand each other transactions directly, no need to even broadcast them to the whole world (so no bandwidth problems). Everyone just keeps any transactions they receive in their own wallet (no global storage problem) and creates new transactions out of those, giving them to the next party (in zero confirmation time!).
Wow, all 5 big problems that Bitcoin has: just gone. And all that still without middlemen!
You can have the above under that one condition: users must be blocked from double spending. In fact the above quite nicely describes current Bitcoin and the way double-spends are prevented is by putting them in chained blocks (causing those 5 "problems"). But what if you could create a safe environment where the non-double-spend can be guaranteed in another way?
Bitcoin is programmable money! The domain is a bit limited, a script lives in a pretty tight virtual space after all, but that space does (since recently) include a time dimension: for example, a coin can be placed somewhere with a guarantee that it can't be moved until a certain time has passed, unless some other conditions are met (2-of-2 signatures)... "can't be moved"! Can't be double-spend...
That's exactly what we needed above! (***)
This not only shows that LN makes a shitton of sense in the first place. It also shows that LN transactions really are just Bitcoin transactions, merely not stored on the blockchain. LN creates a safe environment (albeit smaller and shorter in duration) than what Bitcoin itself covers and allow blockchainless Bitcoin transactions to take place within that environment.
*) Any promises and errors herein are mine and mine alone. I'm a nobody. Don't blame the devs if they don't make it in time.
**) Yes, the public blockchain has a few other uses, but when focusing only on relatively short-term payment functions of Bitcoin, the above holds nicely. For example ignoring initial coin distribution.
***) I'm skipping some nasty details on exactly how to setup such unmovable coins between two parties. Those details make the safe environment smaller again, but nonetheless still large enough to be of use.

So your asking spam attackers to kindly invoice by your rule of sending it all to the same address?
That only means the donations are set up wrongly and there's still no reason to encourage that.
Besides aren't you the one complaining about slow adoption? 10000 same signature transactions are never going to happen. 100 are already extremely rare. And anything more than 1 is already rare plus will be going down in the future.
And WTF anyway? Schnorr with Signature Aggregation does exactly the same thing except it can do it with 10000 DIFFERENT addresses! Why are you such a lying dishonest ignorant sack of shit when Schnorr+SA gets mentioned (blabla adoption will take long time therefore stupid) but then you start promoting a clearly inferior (and pretty dumb) idea, which would have the same adoption problem (plus a shitload of other problems).
And you do the exact same thing with xt thin blocks.

Hint: not the "dishonest" one.
Yes it was an out of balance incentive.


Pretty obvious from the example under "Data". And then explained under "Input" and "Output".
But if you had any clue about Bitcoin, you would have known this intuitively.
The fact that you're comparing this to "2MB HF" and not just any HF, nicely betrays your hidden agenda. You're just FUDding and full of shit because you're butthurt that your stupid "2MB HF" is not happening. Boohoo.
A SF does things that were already legal before the change by assigning new meaning to previously nonsensical (but perfectly legal) transactions. If 100 people agree amongst each other to gives certain transactions a special meaning and they manage to convince a miner to mine those, then there's nothing you can do about that to stop it, nor do you need to give a fuck. They can do whatever they want with their special transactions.
Now the 100 is going to grow to almost everyone (because besides you, most people are not stupid), but still the ones that don't care don't need to care. And then at some point in the future when you install a new version you'd be stupid not to update so that you can interpret what's going on around, even though you still don't care and even thought you're still not using SW transactions yourself.  "ooh the horror... oh I'm being mistreated....ooooooh the heavens are falling..."
But at the same time you dare claim with dry eyes that this is worse than more 25% of miners + most of full nodes being fucked over by a premature unsupported contentious classic HF. Yeah... whatever...

Also: The two and a halve horse head devs have been proven unqualified so regardless of how stupid their ideas are they can't possibly run and maintain a billion dollar economy on their own (by their own admission btw, tom zander recently posted how he doesn't know much of how bitcoin works and he's still learning and has hardly looked at the source code at all so far). That would be one sure way to destroy bitcoin.

It's an idea to make bitcoin more efficient and have better privacy that has been on the shelves for 4+ years. And it makes freaking sense: whoever verifies the blockchain is only interested in proof that the script returned true. It doesn't give a fuck about the script itself, no one does. Anything that makes that proof smaller is a bonus in bandwidth, storage and processing speed.


Permissionless. They can already do that anyway. Noticed coloured coins and counterparty and proof of existence type of things? Factom (i hesitate to mention it, as i hear it's a scam, but the way i imagine it to work is simply publishing the merkle root of a shitton of data).
I guess with MAST they can do it at 0 extra overhead to the blockchain.
The fact is we'll never know how much value is being protected by the mining.
@_date: 2016-04-04 21:32:41
Signatures Aggregateion is also a big one. And possibly, an easier first step as it actually reduces transactions size as a side effect as well easing coinjoin and even providing an extra incentive to do coinjoin: the more signatures, the more space (and thus fee) is saved.

Pricing the point that it changes with time.


They're both different forms of locking up money. That's the whole point oc the analogy! Wherever you park your money it's locked up from the point of view of the shop that you want to buy something from but doesn't accept that form of locked up money.
LN is just another one such method.
Ask Greeks how good it is to keep your money in the bank instead of cash. Your local experience means nothing towards the actual usage patterns. But that doesn't matter, the fact is there are different forms of holding/spending money and all of them have a bit of a conversion delay. LN is just yet another form.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:48:34
Another special case to consider is 1to1 transactions. Clearly no change output there. But then sometimes it's just someone moving money (is that a "real"transaction?). Other times is someone sending to an exchange or otherwise transferring a whole utxo to save on fees.

@_date: 2016-04-25 17:46:35
Well that's because you're on the edge of where the "coin" analogy breaks down. If you want to call them coins then they're only temporary coins and every transaction destroys all the input coins and spawns new output "coins".
Like melting x gold coins into y fresh new coins.
On the other hand it's quite possible to (maybe slightly inaccurately) say that one can trace coins from address to address and apply tainting rules to them. In that case you're talking about the aggregate of multiple coins and not really individual coins anymore. You just define rules like "if one input has cocaine residue on it then all output coins will also". Or, if you like, more accurately: "if 1 cocaine coin is mixed with 7 clean coins, then the output coins will all be 1/8th cocaine tainted."
And similarly you can trace some coins stolen from MtGox to a year later being in the hands of Bob (whether he's to blame for that is a different story).
I guess in the aggregate the coin analogy holds up a little longer, but sure all analogies have a breaking point.

If you are imagining a market with a few different alternatives people can choose from, then you damn well better hope they all have very skilled devs, because rule changes are not just random and then the market decides whether it likes the change or not. That's how evolution works and that takes forever to arrive at still a sub-optimal solution, while the vast majority of iterations literally dies (and thus lose all their money).
Rule changes need very skilled and experienced devs to come up with and implement. Also changing a live system is not something one single person can ever safely do. So yeah, it's always going to be a team and there will need to be consensus among devs and lateron consensus among users and then miners.
Saying it's "useless" and "everything will magically automatically fix itself without it" is just complete bonkers. You're just downplaying the importance of devs and dev-consensus because you don't like the current devs because you're demanding stupid shit and they're not complying.

FUD. In normal cases both parties agree to close and you have your Bitcoin off of LN immediately (just wait the normal amount of confirmations, just as with any Bitcoin transaction).


FUD. Weasel sentence to begin with, but also the facts are incorrect. As long as minimum network scale and connectivity is reached, it will always be simpler to use LN. The difficulty in making the right balances for routing solutions lies in not choosing solutions that incentivize large centralized hubs.


FUD again. This is the same as with any other Bitcoin payment or withdrawal you ever do, which all can be "traced". Especially if you buy coffees every day directly with Bitcoin. Also: that single withdrawal can be done after thousands of LN transactions back and forth, all of which will have been hidden from the Blockchain and the public's eye.

First time I hear scaling equals competitivity. Which is nonsense.
First of all that competitor is going to run into the exact same reasons why "dumb change constant scaling" will not work in Bitcoin. Any altcoin that claims to have better scaling or better limits than Bitcoin is a scam: they don't have the scale that Bitcoin has so it's easy to say. Once they reach that nr of transactions they will find out and it will kill them. THAT is the time bomb.
Second: there's a choice between smart scaling and dumb scaling and you're advocating for doing the dumb scaling because otherwise the competition will je copy it anyway. That's just so stupid on so many levels.

Nope. You'd need another index, costing more work and memory to maintain.


Says every full node operator, who are doing the work that you're not paying anything for anyway. When was the last time you paid anything to a full node doing free work for you?


Yes there is: the whole world knows where you're sending your money too. In fact, smart people do NOT send money to re-used addresses. They shop elsewhere or donate their money somewhere else.


Ask people who create or study block explorers and analysers.
Anyway, time to do your own homework again. I'd be highly surprised if that wildcard thing ever gets implemented. Better not waste your time on understanding that, but shift to Schnorr and SA and MAST and all those cool things on the horizon.

I really don't believe they have the skills to come up with a malleability fix good enough to work with LN. They have some half ass proposal (flexible transactions or something?) but that only covers half of the malleability vectors.
They can't pull it from Core, since they've mutilated their own source with refactors and nonsense all over the place.

Bitcoin needs to be prepared before it can scale. And there are different ways to scale, some of which are way smarter and faster than others. Core just likes the better and safer and faster options.

You got lied to. LN is not possible on bcash. It also needs a malleability fix. A real one, not some half ass workaround that CW and Zander keep talking about. And a real one boils down to exactly SegWit because it's basically the only and simplest way to do it. So that just shows how retarded they are to rip it out and sabotage it for a year. Also: since they have 0 capable developers working on this, none of it will happen anyway.

@_date: 2018-01-09 09:30:13
That's why Luke says 300kB would be better. Tech growth would match chain size growth.
Note how SegWit does allow to throw away part of the transaction. So even though it increases the block size, in the long term it doesn't increase the chain size growth.
I guess at some point taking a UTXO snapshot of a few years ago and validating the amount of PoW on top might be enough trustlessness for most people. The best and most effective manner to do that is still being worked on.
Mimblewimble actually solves this fundamentally btw as old transactions can be actually discarded without trust.
Fees: theres quite a bit of stretch still left in on chain capacity, so number of transactions can still double a few times (more fees). At the same time LN does help a lot by taking the small transactions off chain so only larger payments that can sustain high fees go to the chain.
It's also not a requirement that hashing power continues increasing like crazy forever. It's ok if that growth drops of at some point. It will always still scale with the fiat price of bitcoin (or electricity price in BTC rather).
Hashing power mostly protects recent blocks, older blocks get to piggyback for free on the PoW done on the recent blocks. So the security mining needs to provide is related to the value at risk in recent chain history.
@_date: 2016-04-04 21:34:56
Good riddens to the morons that went to eth. Not a single altcoin can scale as well as Bitcoin, let alone better. Simply because none have put a single bit of effort into any actual scaling solutions.

Well i tried not assuming anything, i was mostly asking questions. But you're saying that so many people (that have invested 10s or 100s of thousands) are stupid for joining a large pool with larger fees. Basically they're too lazy to do a proper comparison.
Well, I agree there are a lot of lazy and stupid proper in the world, but it makes me feel there must be a better reason. Especially since if it's just laziness i would expect them to go for something more local and in their own country (trust thing and in case the court system is required).
Facts are that larger pools are more profitable (lower orphan rates) but as you say it's quite possible that the operators skim off a substantial percentage making it less profitable for the actual miners.
Bit of mystery then.
I always assumed that the overwhelming hashing power was owned in house by those large pools.

No. It's undoable to expect everybody in the world to fully research each pile of shit laying on the road to see if there's a diamond ring in there. If it looks like shit it's probably shit: you instinctively walk around it without even looking.
If only one person in the world does find a diamond ring in one it will be very easy for them to prove that and convince others and they'll come over to have a look. OP described one way to do that. Fact is: that hasn't happened since Bitcoin started.
Even better in one example where an anonymous person did create a diamond ring, he was smart enough not to hide it in a pile of shit but directly show it to the community and it was picked up: mimblewimble.

Actually quite a lot more than just a software system. Easily proven by the fact that you can take that software system today and start your own but it won't be worth anything.
And although indeed not a religion, money is actually awfully close to a believe system in some respects.


I can keep an eye out for interesting tech without buying into, let alone spreading, scams or otherwise hopelessly impossible goals. And the nice thing in practice is actually that all interesting tech (at least until now) has gravitated towards Bitcoin instead of the other way around. Even stuff that seemed hopelessly incompatible and in direct competition with Bitcoin, like MimbleWimble. It was welcomed with open arms.

And that would also have been a nice time for services to start doing batching and other efficiency improvements, as Core devs have been warning for many years. But no, you and Ver promised them endlessly bigger blocks, so don't worry, just keep polluting.
And still today your friends at conbase have done absolutely nothing towards SegWit adoption or even trying to not waste space on inefficient non-batched transactions.

You're making a beginner mistake in understanding the different kinds of consensus at play here and will get sucked into Roger Ver type of scammers that leech on that ignorance.
It's actually very simple:
1) Full Nodes verify EVERYTHING fully according to the Bitcoin rules. Any invalid transaction outside or inside a block get rejected and whoever sent it get banned.
2) Miners (hopefully also full nodes, not always) select which transaction goes into blocks and they seal the block with Proof of Work. Proof of Work doesn't mean anything to the validity of the contents and it can't.
3) Full nodes don't trust miners to be full nodes or honest, they check EVERYTHING again. Without proof of work there would be many alternative blocks with different double spend transactions, so a full node could pick any and different full nodes would end up with different chains. But since the point of a network is that everybody agrees, it makes sense to only pick those blocks that are part of the most-work-chain and ignore the rest. That way all Full Nodes deterministically end up validating and picking the same transactions.
That's all Proof of Work is used for.

They have some half assed "solutions" that somewhat sort of fix a few malleability vectors, but not all. And if you don't fix all, you might as well not fix any.
Most of SegWit is just the malleability fix, you can't make it much less complex by taking anything out, because it's all interdependent and sort of automatically happens because of the difference in calculating the txid.

Yeah bitcoin has improved a lot since then. "Headers First" lets it download blocks out of order and in parallel, much like bittorrent does. But now it can immediately process the blocks while downloading. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:37:51
And a very dangerous one. Other large miners can take this transaction and try to replace their block. If 2 or 3 of the biggest miners agree to do that together, they have easy money.

I said "all the way", so reading comprehension is minimal.


That's actually the only reason I and probably most people are in Bitcoin yeah: because world renowned experts and fundamentally proven good people are working on it. Had it been just assholes and retards like Zander and Ver and Rizen and you, then indeed Bitcoin would be worth one cent IF it could manage to keep running for more than a day without crashing.

I doubt any decently capable developer would destroy their chance of ever having a non-laughing-stock career by working for them. They'd be dumb as fuck to follow in the footsteps of Rizen, Zander and Emun. Someone who actually understands Bitcoin and its codebase enough to actually work on it comfortably at such a deep level would never ever consider working for a bunch of amateur scammers and would find themselves aligned much more with Core devs (even if they have large disagreements). And he/she would also understand that it's an almost impossible task to pull of alone: you need peer review and code review and lots of help by equally capable people to share the responsibility with.
Sure it's open source, but the very first thing bcash did was refactor their entire codebase, there is no way in hell they'll be able to fit it back in without a thousand bugs.


It's not the LN part of the implementation that's hard: it's actually making bcash suitable for LN style smart contracts that is hard.
I've heard Ver already brag about future LN compatiblity a few times now. I can't imagine any LN proponent having the need to hook up bcash, not if it requires so much effort and a large part of the bcash community being against it in the first place.


That's "implementing SW" from a user perspective. That's super easy and far far less dangerous, compared to implementing SW in the consensus code of Bitcoin.


Well, never say never, but I don't see it happening within any reasonable timespan. I much more expect them to just fake all kinds of fancy features by centralizing the hell out of it. Centralized systems are much easier to code and maintain and fix bugs in.

It raises fees which are an annoyance for real users, but mostly a perfect FUD narrative to suckers that don't understand. Those suckers then start doing the bidding for those doing the spam attack, which is whine and complain and talk shit and maybe even jump ship putting their money into the sucker pits laid out by again those same attackers: "buy bcash/eth/dash/, it's so much better".
The spam itself doesn't hurt Bitcoin itself much. The part that never gets confirmed is meaningless, some of it gets confirmed and will be an eternal waste of chain space and UTXO, but that's not too bad. There are also several counter measures people can take and further near term improvements will provide to reduce fees, so the annoyance should go down and cost for spammers up.

Not necessarily good. And not necessarily optimal: if there were a way for Bitcoin to lock you into only mining Bitcoin and nothing else, that would be better. It's unlikely that's possible of course.


Yet the goal of the Bitcoin protocol is not to suit the economic interests of every actor, it merely incentivizes every actor to do what is good for the protocol. Bitcoin is the beast that gives other actors just enough to have them do what is good for the beast. If the Bitcoin were designed better to get more bang for its buck that would be a win for Bitcoin. Not saying I have good proven ideas about such improvements or that they're even possible.


Yes, exactly. So if miners would be incentivized to look a little more towards the long term future instead of immediate money, then they'd be less inclined to be mercenaries and stick with Bitcoin a bit more even when time a temporarily a bit rough.
Like the 100 block minimum delay before the coinbase transaction can be spent. Arguably, if that were a 1000 then either you have to stick with Bitcoin longer (at least not abandon it so much that its price goes down). Even if you sell your share of the coinbase reward in advance (which you generally do in pools), then you're just shifting the risk to someone else, so he will be paying you less.
I guess any argument that says you shouldn't be supporting an attack on Bitcoin, because that could hurt your own bottom line at some point (imagine getting stuck with worthless ASICs if Bitcoin needs to do a PoW change), boils down to a tragedy of the commons where if you don't mine bcash, someone else will, so that doesn't matter.
I've long been for extending the coinbase lock period, even to months, to be honest. But I maybe the consensus experts have very good counter arguments (probably centralization pressure, now that I think about it: only large miners/pools can take on the risk of months without payment). And in either case, I don't think it could be changed without a hard fork, so I don't really see it happening.
I guess in this particular case you could argue that you're actually hurting bcash more than bitcoin since you're dumping bcash, adding to the selling pressure.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:26:33
So you only pick it up if it's worth your time and effort?
\&gt; unless I wanted to gamble on that value rising.
Indeed. But then you'd just buy the thing cheaper somewhere else instead of spending the money to pick it up.
Compare this to what miners do. They see a potential reward floating around on the internet and have to make the decision whether to try to pick it up or not. Combined they are willing to spend up to just below the level of the reward they stand to get.
Today all miners combined get 12.5+fees BTC every 10 minutes. Next year they'll be getting 6.25+fees BTC every 10 minutes. Etc. The fee part is an unknown, but the fixed number is trending towards 0 in a very predictably manner.
But what if the $/BTC price goes down tomorrow? Or triples next month?
Those are the variables you need: block subsidy + fees and $/BTC. Number of transactions per second is not in there. By far the biggest unknown is $/BTC. At least in the foreseeable future.

You can start making up your own definitions or you can use existing ones. Full node means Fully Validating Node. It's not just a label that I use for it.


Wrong again. It's determined by the rules of the system as set out Satoshi (which evolved a bit over time, but are still to this day backwards compatible). Miners have no say in this.


That's exactly what a double spend is: one of the two is trying to spend money that doesn't exist anymore and the miners decide which one was first (i.e. the order).

Common error, but that's not correct. They're not passive. They check transactions and tell counterfeiters and charlatans to go fuck themselves. No cup of coffee for them. That's how bcash and segwit2x were utterly rejected.

Large amounts will always be done on chain as it's likely very hard to find a path of nodes that each have $thousands available. They'd charge high LN fees.
But when you send a $million, the on chain fee is not a big deal anymore. Same with confirmation times: cup of coffee none vs buying a car.
Some balance will automatically form: small payments through LN, large through chain.

Block size limit was increased. Half a year before bcash was even thought up. But the same people sabotaged that segwit rollout for a year and are still stalling, so go figure. It's up to users to adopt it, if they don't then i guess they're ok with the current fees. Devs don't have power to force users to do something.
In don't think "consensus on a stop gap increase" would have made any difference. The block size was always just a political excuse to stir shit and attempt to grab power. All the way back to Gavin's first attempts as installing hinself as lead dev and chief scientist.

His use of the word wasteful can be argued with, but using the word (in)efficient like this is definitely wrong. ASICs are extremely efficient at what they do and the better they get, the better for bitcoin.

It is.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:36:32
Chip efficiency is not a computer science problem (not if the algorithm is fixed anyway).
More efficient chips will simply increase the difficulty. If a miners can earn X for mining Bitcoin then they will spend almost X on electricity, efficiency is irrelevant for that.


Block rewards will go down, but fees should replace them. Maybe not one to one. Hopefully not, as that would save a lot of electricity and fees, but that depends on what security requirements remain. But then maybe the price will go 10x again and that still means 10x more electricty as well.


The only reason huge mining farms earn more than solo (per Watt) is that they can save thanks to economies of scale.

Ver is the puppeteer. He probably has Jihan's arm up his own ass, but he'll deny that.
Blockstream/Adam have nothing to do with puppeteering. They all have many decades of (volunteering) work in different freedom and cypherpunk areas, they were already working individually (volunteer) working for Bitcoin for years and they they decided to form a company together to pay for more developers (in a time when _nobody_ paid for any developer) and have some stability in their own financial life. They're still a small part of Bitcoin Core.


Original vision is decentralized.
That's indeed a hard problem (which is why it took 30 years of failed attempts before Satoshi) and it remains a hard problem to not let it crumble. Doing stupid shit like randomly increasing block sizes will surely fuck up that original vision.


True. But when choosing between the image quality of analog fancy cassette tapes, I couldn't give a fuck which one won (other than I'd prefer the one whose machine I had just bought, otherwise I'd have to throw it out and buy a new machine).
What we're talking about here is the choice between
1) an actual leap in human achievement, and hopefully improved prosperity and fairness for everybody, through a decentralized non-corrupt (financial) revolution.
2) a slightly improved PayPal IF governments allow that to happen.

So, you're a game theory expert as well as world class dev and expert on P2P and distributed systems? All those people say there are and they've got scientific studies and common sense simple logic to back it up. What do you have?
Let's have a look.


That's not a contradiction at all. Rather the opposite in fact.


Only thanks to the hard work of Core developers optimizing the hell out of the software over many years now. Oh except you're still wrong because... distributing 8MB worldwide would actually take more than a hundredth of the time to generate one. Note how you've just shown yourself an unqualified reddit quack as you think distributing a block to all nodes worldwide over a P2P network across all kinds of boundaries like the Great Firewall, is the same as you downloading an 8MB file.


Makes no logical sense at all. You're drawing nonsense conclusions left and right.


Blatantly false. Take a bitcoin version from a few years ago and try to download the whole blockchain: it will barely finish EVER. Then add 8MB blocks and it will never ever catch up.
And then UTXO set is also growing so you're still wrong.


Ah the old SPV argument... reddit quack on trustless systems as well then.


Are you talking about fees keeping spam out and being an incentive to keeping the UTXO set down? But you're arguing for limitless blocks and 0.000001 fees. So WTF?

LN *is* a lot like caching. Just like a hard disk and file systems have write caches where not every little write action immediately goes to disk but instead get buffered for a little while: multiple writes to the same sector get coalesced into one write. 
Same for CPU to memory.
The right type and amount of caching at the boundary between systems can often (to a large extent) give us the best of both worlds (in speed, cost and other properties).
The blockchain is this slow and very expensive global write-only memory. Caching multiple writes locally and only occasionally writing it to the blockchain is a huge improvement. Depending on the use case there are many forms of caching and the trick is to get as much out of it as possible. Exchanges (at least the smart ones) are already bundling transactions, buffering them for some time and then combining them. It helps, sometimes quite a bit, but we're probably talking about percentages in savings. And this method only applies to services that have high outgoing transaction rates.
In fact exchanges themselves are already huge caches where thousands/millions of transactions are done and only a few deposits/withdrawals. But those caches require extreme trust in the operators of the exchanges and their abilities to keep hackers and governments out. As such they are an existential risk to the whole of Bitcoin. They cache very efficiently but they do so by giving up the decentralization and trustlessness properties of Bitcoin.

That's actually a fairly trivial "problem" that will simply solve itself through normal market forces.
If it's easier to obtain Bitcoins in the US then the price will be a bit lower than elsewhere. That means traders will start doing arbitrage to buy coins from the cheap place and sell them at more expensive places (thereby reducing the price difference and mismatch in supply/demand). At some point Amazon itself might come up with the bright idea that since they're paying chinese suppliers maybe they should send part of their coins to a chinese exchange instead and pocket the higher bitcoin price themselves.
As soon as there's a price difference someone will jump in to extract money from it. If that requires having a bank account in the US and one in EU and pumping money around and coins in opposite direction then that's fairly easy. If it requires smuggling suitcases of money across some border because some government is trying to prevent this natural flow from occurring, then people will do that anyway.

That's actually a fairly unlikely scenario because that doesn't take into account:
* that he needs to have picked the right shitcoin from thousands (hindsight only)
* that he needs to have picked the right timing (hindsight only)
* nearly all of which are scams where only insiders get rich and everybody else (by definition) loses.
* the exchange he keeps his shitcoins on doesn't go under and he loses everything
* the shitcoin itself survives and he doesn't get double spent or otherwise loses his coins to whichever attack or vulnerability is guaranteed to be present in said insecure coin
* he'll have missed out on free airdrop dividends from bcash, bgold and bdiamond (~20 to 30%).
* he'll have to live with a guilty consciousness of having participated in a scam, taking money from unknowing newcomers.
Taking those into account, holding bitcoin in cold storage is for sure the only winning strategy.

A hard fork by definition means EVERYBODY agrees. In that case there's no problem and it's just like a stock split: the price adjusts to exactly take the new limit and issuance into account, nobody gets any richer overnight.
Note: everyfuckingbody must agree, not just a majority as the article states. Bitcoin is not a fking democracy.

Fees will most likely go up.


The free market of supply and demand will determine the fees.

It's childish to complain open source volunteers are not working hard enough and fixing your personal problems quickly enough. That's where the "do it yourself" reaction comes from. Other than that, sure you're welcome to discuss and come up with proposals. Just remember you're not the only one to have done so and 99.999% of all ideas have already been considered 4 years ago. People will gladly help you learn and coming up with ideas is a valid part of learning. I'm sorry to say that idiots and trolls have probably worn through most people's patience by now and that's why you might sometimes get knee jerk responses. It's not nice and it's not fair, but maybe if you understand where it's coming from and get past that, you'll see that people will actually take the time to explain.


LN channels are opened and closed on the blockchain. If those on chain transactions are made more efficient (smaller) then that means channels are cheaper to open/close but more importantly: the same blockchain capacity can be used to open/close more channels at the same time. Which means the blockchain can support a larger Lightning Network, which means the LN actually becomes more efficient itself (more netting, relatively fewer opens/closes).
Also, likely not all transactions on the blockchain will be LN open/closes, there are still other use cases too. So the same logic follows if those transactions are made more efficient.

Probably not the only thing wrong with it. Plus Roger himself was one of the saboteurs that delayed the malleability fix for more than a year. And it's stil not fixed in bcash. And like everything in bcash world it was clearly a dumb ripoff project 2 to attempt to take control and centralize development.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:02:01
Currently it does. Go send a bunch of SegWit transactions and watch how the blocksize AND the number of transactions increase, while YOU pay a lower fee. If blocks don't grow then people clearly don't give enough of a fuck about the fees.

I gave you a specific list of all points where you were blatantly wrong and where you are disrespecting and pissing on the people who have built Bitcoin as it is today, voluntarily and for free, and who are directly to thank for it even still existing, let alone thousands x price rise.

You can fuck off with the "allowed" insinuations.
"daily market cap" wtf?
It's a decentralized open source project. Time lines are a contradiction to that, so fucking duh you don't get them.
Fees and congestion are not the fault of the developers at all. They had a blocksize increase ready more than a year ago. Fault lies with FUDders and liars like Ver and co. Fault lies with services and wallets being horribly inefficient. Fault lies with users not using SegWit. There's easily 4x scaling by merely getting simple things fixed that can be done completely independently from core devs. That's the answer you can get for today. By the time you've done your share there, the core devs will be ready with the next step.


Are you fucking insane? The only thing that's unacceptable is slave driving assholes like you.

1 minute is still significantly long and (if it were caused by slow software/too big blocks) is still a major centralization driver. 1 out of 10 minutes means 10% loss in fee revenue, except for large miners who often find 2 blocks in a row and generally have better connections.
Luckily that problem has been mostly solved by the hard work of Core and those few remaining empty blocks are mostly because some miners just haven't gotten their shit together yet and then it's only their own problem (except for the slight reduction in transaction capacity).
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:28:06
MAST is about IF/THEN/ELSE branches inside one script and only putting the code for the branch that was actually taken on the blockchain instead of the whole script. Batching transactions doesn't change their scripts, I don't think MAST has any influence on batching.
Note that the merkle tree that MAST builds has nothing to do wtih the merkle trees already in the blockchain currently. It's a whole separate MAST merkle tree for each script.
Still sounds you're confusing things with Schnorr and SA. Where batching delivers huge returns.
Or maybe I'm missing something big.

@_date: 2017-12-12 02:11:32
Because then the next block will have no transactions and thus no fees. Once the block subsidy is low enough and the normal fee high enough, that means it's more profitable for a miner to try to orphan the previous block (low chance but high gain) than to mine the next block (0 gain). And long before that worst case, it will still mean that miners will simply turn off their equipment until mempool has enough fee in it, temporarily ceasing security. Which also fucks with the block time and the difficulty adjustment and generally lowers security through lower difficulty.
And I'm even forgetting about the biggest effect: if mempool is empty regularly why would i ever pay anything for a transaction in the first place? There's no fee market when supply is infinite and all fees will tend towards 0 while letting all the spam through and exploding the blockchain size.

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:15:29
Why I think the way truth is? What's not clear?


Dozens of reasons, for example: 
1) BCash was not backwards compatible, it's a failed hard fork and now altcoin. SegWit is backwards compatible and fully opt in, use it whenever you're ready, use an old version or legacy transactions as long as you're not ready.
2) SegWit has many performance, security and scaling improvements of which larger blocks is actually the least important and least interesting. Only for all the other advantages it would have been a perfect update. Larger blocks is just a nice bonus.
3) Bitcoin had performance issues where validation of blocks required N^2 operations, so doubling blocksize could end up costing 4x CPU time to validate, which in certain cases could end up taking a significant portion of 10 minutes even on fast hardware. DOS attack and centralization.
4) The people and devs behind that are complete retards and sammers that don't understand Bitcoin at all and can't get anything right (proven by events in the years leading up to it and the events after). They did zero science, no design, no specification, no open source development, no peer review, no testing, no consensus building. All they did was shit on the people that did the actual work and stealing and plagiarizing their work.
5) Even if they weren't retards and the idea was solid, Bitcoin can never be controlled by a few people. Bitcoin's value comes from being decentralized, the whole project fails if a few individuals can steer it. There needs to be consensus beforehand and even then such a big change needs to be rolled out slowly.
6) SegWit opens up the paths towards more actual improvements instead of braindead block size increases: it will allow tech that roughly halves the transaction sizes (which is obviously better than doubling the block size in every imaginable way).
7) I could go on for hours.
Here's one good resource on actual details:

False. The "routing" in the base layer is a full broadcast (i.e. not routing by definition). Sitting in one big restaurant shouting everything you say so everybody can hear is not optimal decentralization (and doesn't scale).

Core delivered a blocksize increase more than a year ago. If people are ol with current fees they are free not to use it.
Nobody promised LN IN 18 months or whatever bullshit strawman you put in your head. And it's add actually ready to roll out.


I don't want a discussion with liars, manipulators or trolls. I'm merely pointing out your full of strawman shit.

Fuck you ungrateful slave driving bastard. The devs already delivered. More than a year ago a block size in increase. But more importantly a continuous stream of high quality even more important updates.


More insinuations. It's open source asshole. You can take control too. Do it. Stop telling others what to do in their own free time. Are you paying anyone? Did bitcoin cost you a cent?


There is no steering in decentralized open source.

There's nothing devs need to do to fix this. There is easily 4x more capacity available without a single line of code change in bitcoind. Users are free to take that if they want. Permissionless.

That's an important part, especially in the beginning when the network is small and fragile. But even without that, if a bug hub charges too much, I can simply open a channel around the big hub and be cheaper. Then other people will automatically start routing through my channel too. A big hub simply offers no advantage while it still costs something  for the owner if it doesn't get used.

Well, I don't have time to keep going at this. Sometimes all I can do is call something a scam because it's so blatantly obvious to me because of the history that I"m aware of: I see a thousand reasons and I just have no idea where to even start.
More general, you really have to approach this whole field differently than anything else: assume everything is a scam, but stay open minded enough to spot who is not blatantly lying and give them a second consideration. That also means that anybody who lies even just once immediately drops all the way to the back of the queue to be disregarded and distrusted. Life honestly is just to short to do it any other way. (There's a difference between ignorance and lying, but spreading ignorant falsehoods after having been corrected a few times is just as bad).


Things take time, this is a living breathing network of computers and humans held together by hard cryptography for the computers and economic incentives for the humans. It's good that things don't radically change from day to day. And in this case it's taking longer because it's being actively delayed by anti-bitcoiners trying to position themselves as a central controlling party or pump their own shitcoin.


Actually no. Not at all in fact. This is exactly how Bitcoin is supposed to work.
It's just very bumpy right now because it's only been a short while that it's finally getting into this phase, but a healthy stable predicable fee market where low ballers have to wait until the weekends or drop out completely is exactly how this is supposed to work. It's currently very bumpy because hardly any body/software is prepared for it causing most people to overpay (which jacks up the price for everybody) and some people to underpay (causing complaints). This intricate web of interplaying supply/demand market needs some time to settle into a stable state. Some parties are actively trying to prevent that from happening through spam attacks and FUD.
But we probably couldn't have wished for a better time to be in this phase transition because people now have a lot of proven and upcoming technology available to mitigate their high fees thereby making everything more efficient and stable (there need to be incentives driving towards the stable state, otherwise everybody just keeps fucking around and we never get there). Technologies like batching transactions (aided by RBF, CPFP), SegWit (dynamic block size where doing the smart thing is incentivized with lower fees and increasing the blocksize for everybody at the same time). Schnorr + Signatue Aggregation + MAST are upcoming techs that will reduce significantly transaction sizes further (same effect as blocksize increase without any of the down sides, and again demand driven). And then Lightning Network will start taking smaller payments off chain.


Yeah, that's a natural first thought and that's why it's so milkable by scammers. But once you understand the tech it's actually not simple at all: 1) because it requires other fixes and optimizations first to be even possible at all, like all the stuff in SegWit. And 2) as that it undermines the decentralization, which is the one property that everything else is built on top of.


They actually can't because they don't have anything to explain. They're a copy of Core's work with actual fixes ripped out and bugs added instead, in the name of false promises to newcomers. And it cures hemorrhoids too. But once you look past the shiny front, it's so full of self-contradictions and omissions that it's a miracle it survived past a week at all (proving there's still enough dumb money around).


It's very easy to build something that appears to be "fast and cheap"; just forget about the "decentralized" part of Bitcoin and everything becomes possible and easy. Just like downloading a file through HTTP is a lot easier than through decentralized BitTorrent.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:59:50
Nonsense. You need to read up on how LN works.
He already mentioned this too:


So your selective quoting and uppercasing of FUD words doesn't bode well.
A flat fully decentralized network does not mean everybody will have exactly the same number of channels with the same amount of coins in them. Naturally high volume exchanges moving millions per day will have a bit more than grandma in a village in the country side.

What are you talking about? We just had a blocksize increase in august. You want one every month?
We currently have a dynamic, purely demand driven, size limit. Miners that want to game it are paying the price. Users that want to overpay pay the price. Services that refuse to optimize pay the price.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:03:40
Fees are no problem at all, they're a design part of Bitcoin both providing security and anti spam. In the meantime the blocksize is currently dynamic but if those who pay the fee don't think it's a problem then i guess they'll decide not to increase the block size. It's up to them, not you.

There are plenty of Core devs and others in the space who have published their vision or partial road maps. A lot have turned out too optimistic or surpassed by better ideas. There are even documents that multiple people have agreed on, Greg's email "road map" comes to mind.
But then actual road map also implies assigning and planning projects and deadlines to groups of people. That tends to be kind of impossible when you're mostly talking about volunteers working on their own thing in the area of their own expertise.

You're lying. Not a single one does. They've all dispersed into their own little scam corner and none are doing anything with bcash. Oh and it's also the irrelevant devs that have only done harm and sabotage for at least the last 3 years rather than anything productive.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:45:27
Yes, miners can spam their own blocks for free (or leave them empty). Still an opportunity cost, so it's still more expensive and it still costs them.
Yes they have used ASICboost, and very likely every non-segwit block they mine today is using it. ASICboost gives something like a 30% increase if I remember correctly, but they'll miss out on the extra fee income had they mined segwit, so it roughly balances out.


Fully agree.


That's sort of correct, although it's probably the other way around: they only mine on the header of the prev block so they can save a little time by not validating the full block. They run a small risk there if the header turns out to be invalid, but they get a X seconds headstart, so it makes sense. They've been bitten in the past by that and it is actually bad for security of the whole network, but these days it seems to be done only for a short time so yes that's probably okay. It took a lot of hard work optimizing the hell out of block propagation and validation code to get us to this point though, it used to be really bad. Would be a bit of a shame if we immediately start increasing the load again to go back to the old days. And of course this is (was) not the only reason larger blocks are dangerous (as you mention next).


Correct. Here too huge advancements have been made over the years, in preparation for the SegWit blocksize increase and future increases.


Actually, SegWit makes things a bit confusing there. In normal circumstances blocks would become between 2 to 3 MB big. Anything over 3MB is likely spam/abuse and 4MB would mean 1 single transaction with almost 4MB of signatures, which is definitely abuse. It's unlikely to happen (because very expensive) but if it does frequently devs would probably have to do something about it to block it.
Storage, CPU, bandwidth are all things to consider. Most systems can probably handle quite a bit when leisurely downloading and validating things. But you have to consider things under adversarial and more difficult circumstances: miners (and the security of the whole network) need it done instantly, even across Chinese firewalls and under DOS attacks. Most other users can probably cope with a bit more delay, but then a lot of them don't want to pay extra for storage, power and bandwidth (I would and I do, but fact is higher costs means fewer full nodes). And then there are the new users that have to download the blockchain all the way from the start. 4 days of downloading plus continuous 100% CPU and disk usage doesn't sound very attractive to a lot of new users, so they pick SPV wallets instead.
Full nodes are immensely important to the security of the network. They saved us dozens of times over the last few years from evil actors wanting to take over the network. A large proportion of owners and merchants needs to run their own full node to protect their own money/business and thereby protect Bitcoin as a whole.

Except it practically is. Anything that fixes malleability basically HAS to do exactly what SegWit did. There's a few choices not regarding malleability that could be made differently in an alternative-SegWit, but actually very little as pretty much all SegWit benefits either directly or indirectly stem from this malleability fix. Even the block size increase is a logical consequence (although that can be nullified).
Bottom line: such an alternative SegWit implementation would be hardly any simpler or less intrusive, more likely more complex. And with the track records of the devs involved in bcash we already know it will spectacularly and hilariously fail either way.

So SegWit it is then. You got it. More than a year ago already actually. Good. Glad that whole narrative can be over now.

No. You're turning this upside down. They're wasting blockspace like crazy and preventing others from using it. Companies like that are the one and only direct cause for high fees at the moment. 
All while hypocritically they are the ones shouting the loudest that blocksize must increase, shitting on the whole community and supporting direct attacks against bitcoin.
I have no idea why they would pay the fee for you, i assume and hope you're paying for it in the spread, otherwise this would be direct proof of them running a fractional reserve.

Pfff Peter... been too long since I last watched anything of him. He's made himself such a joker in such record time by betting on all the wrong horses and coming up with plagiarized ideas and then fucking those up in ridiculous ways. He was literally one of those "I'm new to X and I'm here to fix it" people and after immediately falling flat on their face, instead of realizing they were wrong, the only thing they can do is double down and make even more stupid claims.
All agreed.


a) People that don't control their own private keys don't really own the coins. They're playing an extremely dangerous game endangering themselves and (when in big numbers) the whole of Bitcoin. Apart from that, they should be putting pressure on whoever is controlling the keys to "their" coins. They don't have to mention the word "SegWit" or know what it means, they should just complain about the high fees charged by those services (without blaming Bitcoin itself).
b) BigBlockers try to build this strawman where the high fees are the fault of 1 MB blocks, but that's such a lie no matter from what side you look at it, it's amazing. The "high fee" complaints may be valid, but they need to be aimed at the actual cause of the problems. And to solve those actual causes, pressure needs to be put on them (they've had years to fix it without pressure, but they just don't).

A soft fork doesn't even need to reach 100% adoption ever. Quite possible that some people will run a non SegWit node for eternity. But other less critical and less invasive soft forks might actually take much longer and fewer % adoption.
Bcash was not a hard fork, is just an altcoin.
Hard fork means when Bitcoin itself takes a turn in the path is going down by changing the rules but everybody (as in near 100%) agreeing and following.
A fork does not mean chain split. In fact a chain split would be a failure. A fork just means there's a fork in the road the blockchain is growing along and the blockchain as a whole either goes straight (no hard fork) or takes the turn (hard fork).
A soft fork is like narrowing the road a little bit (making the rules more strict). From now on you're not allowed to walk near the edge anymore, but since nobody was doing that anyway nobody needs to care. And in the meantime we got another level on the road or

No I'm not confusing Script. And yes, of course Bitcoin protocol encompasses much more than just the blockchain.
The point is just that you have to look at things from different perspectives. Every analogy breaks down, but they can still be useful to further understanding. Calling it a database is missing the point. Calling it just a protocol is also missing the point.
Call it bootstrap data then. If I give you my blocks directory, you can bootstrap your node without trusting me. And if you shut down your PC and then start it up again the next day, I can provide you with further bootstrap data to get your database back up to the tip.
This "us exchanging bootstrap data" is a sync protocol of sorts, just like Sql servers have replication data that they can send to a slave server to have its replication slaves get up to date.
That doesn't say anything about the purpose of the database or what happens afterwards with the data. It doesn't take away anything from the bigger picture and the much bigger thing that is Bitcoin. It merely zooms in on one aspect of its inner workings. One gear in the whole machine. One sub-protocol in the whole intertwined bigger picture.
A sync protocol without the surrounding database is useless, so when you take a step back and look at the whole thing it's an advanced distributed (for SQL servers) or decentralized (Bitcoin) database.

I have no idea what those things you mentioned are, they don't sound very useful, but even if the idea would be I have no doubt whatsoever that they won't deliver anything decentralized (since the baselayer is already so thoroughly rotten and any usecase I've ever heard needs an oracle anyway) , nor trustworthy (i.e. not get hacked/frozen/etc.).


I've never understood why that state needs to be on the chain though. Why not an LN or BitTorrent like network that deals with the smart contracts between whatever peers are involved, hooking up gigabytes of state for all I care, and then just settle eventually on the blockchain, preferably netting and batching those closing transactions. Most use cases need oracles anyway, so just throw the oracles in as peers or do something clever like the Discreet Logic thing.
Sure it's easy to copy/paste some javascript and php code from all over the place and make a website, like was done in the early web years, but we're still cleaning up the mess from all the cross site sql injection cookie spoofing Flash plugins and broken browser crap and whatever other vulnerabilities that was introduced there.

You're the one assuming low fees is an objective or design goal or requirement. The universe doesn't owe anyone free shit.


I didn't say that. And people that do are ignorant. They're also mostly big block numpties coincidentally.


High fees is not a problem, that's your straw man.


Don't think that's actually a common term, but yeah signature aggragation, preferably decentralized manner definitely helps make more space available in blocks. As does SegWit and as do many other past and upcoming improvements. Those put some downward pressure on fees, while upward pressure comes from popularity and high usage. An equilibrium will have to form between those and that's what the fee will be. There's hardly a "too high" possible there.
But Bitcoin is still just an experiment and it may well just fail completely. Maybe it will fail if no such stable equilibrium can form.

Peter Rizun.


Thank you, most people don't, so thanks for letting me know.


The thing is that finally we have some incentive for wallets software and service providers to start optimizing their transactions and their fee estimations to stop overpaying. There is a lot left to gain there alone, and then there's an almost doubling of blocksize still possible simply by starting to use SegWit transactions. As long as people are still mostly using non-segwit transactions, that clearly proves that people don't really care enough about the fees yet.
By the time that scaling is mostly over, hopefully we'll start seeing Schnorr, MAST, SA and LN.


Do you run a full node?
There are actually many angles that clearly indicate bad things when block sizes increase. It used to be a lot more, like even simply the CPU time for validating a single block would simply mean that doing an initial full blockchain download would basically never catch up to the tip of the chain ever, unless running on the very fastest hardware available. Same for block propagation through the network. Luckily Core did an amazing engineering job optimizing the shit out all those kinds of bottlenecks by hand optimizing code, doing super smart caching on all levels, doing actual smart block propagation with Compact Blocks etc. etc. Most of those things were non-consensus code and were "hidden" in the "normal" upgrades. SegWit itself was a huge step there too. Any block size increase to 2 or max 4MB before all those optimizations would just literally have made things explode without question.
BCH will probably never get to that explosion because it likely won't be used at all and it will surely not get updated (maybe some fake false promises updates) anymore because they simply have 0 developers worth anything. They also made it impossible for themselves to copy further updates that core make.
Anyway only since last August you can even think about bigger blocks with a straight face, and SegWit already does that. But even now there are problems left that will likely cause (mining) centralization with bigger blocks (according to luke even now with just SegWit).
One last reason blockchains won't scale is that the security of Bitcoin depends on fees and fees depend on a properly functioning fee market where users have an incentive to pay some fee. Any scaling that increases block size (supply of block space) to something greater than the mempool (demand for block space) will reset the fee market where fees drop to near 0. So even if it were physically possible to run ever increasing block sizes, then we still don't want it. Hopefully someone smart will come up with a good way to make the block size dynamic while keeping the fee market from collapsing. The problem is that the obvious methods are all game-able by miners and/or spammers.

That makes no sense. One didn't follow from the other at all.
Merchants certainly don't want to end up with thousands of channels containing nothing but dust. They want 5 channels (or whatever) to reliably deal with thousands of transactions, eventually in and out, and once one closes have a decent size coin worthy of moving on-chain (to re-open another channel).
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:27:39
Please don't link to that scammy idiot. He's been wrong on literally everything he's said since he arrived in Bitcoin and immediately started yapping his big mouth.
With "significant" I mean in relation to projected requirements like x transactions per day for every human being on the planet and that's ignoring machine2machine payments. On that scale 1MB is equal to 10MB, just 10MB screws up decentralization and will likely destroy all special properties that make Bitcoin worth anything in the first place.


Subjective but also not a really valid metric. Why are they held up? Some are spam. Some are not taking advantage of the block size increase that already rolled out in august. Some are just blatantly inefficient and should be batched (coinbase is notorious for that). Some are just too low value to make any sense whatsoever (coffees).
For the first time there is now a clear pressure for wallets and services to get their shit together or drown in customer complaints, lose money on fees and go out of business. That's the best way of scaling right now: get shit more efficient so it's better for everybody without additional costs.
Then there's Schnorr+Mast+SA coming up that will reduce transaction size, which again is so much better than increasing block size.
And then LN will offload all small value transactions and do an actual 100x to million x scaling. And by then we'll see what's next.
A "centralized" LN is mostly an oxymoron but even a network with many hubs and permissionless low barrier to entry for competition is completely fine. Decentralized on that layer has different requirements than on the blockchain layer.

SegWit was actually simpler than what a blocksize increase would require. And SegWit could have rolled out in little over a year because it was a soft fork and simpler. But then saboteurs delayed it for another year. A hard fork is much harder and takes a lot more preparation and coordination.

The balance is per channel. Not per node.
So a node in the middle has one channel to the left and one channel to the right. When a transactions goes through from left to right, both of its channel balances get shifted (to the right). Both becoming unbalanced if more transactions go in one direction than the other.
That's one reason why it's important to have a decentralized flat network with fairly random connections instead of hub-and-spoke models. In a flat network the chances of transactions going in opposite directions and canceling each other out are much higher.
Luckily this is also a reason why hub-and-spoke is unlikely to form in the first place, as people (and hubs) will bear a lot of costs without getting the full benefit of LN. So the incentives align perfectly there.

Devs don't give timelines and as you say you know how OSS works, you know that timelines don't mean anything. Or are you saying you don't understand OSS afterall? And LN wasn't invented yet in 2011 so that's just a dumb remark anyway.


Yeah the wright brothers also had a hard deadline, fly after new years or pack up and go home.
It's fucking decentralized open source making something never before made, inventing solutions as obstacles come up. There are no deadlines. No timelines. No roadmap. No design specifications.
And since you're such a slave driver trying to shit on people doing voluntary work you have not paid a single cent for and telling them to work harder, I'll give YOU a deadline: I want a fully working LN and 10MB blocksize increase with Schnorr Signatures bitcoind from you. I'll give you 18 months. Don't come back until you're done.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:22:52


No. Why would it get more expensive? It just sits there until people give up or RBF to a higher fee. 


Yes. That's because fee estimation in wallets still generally sucks. A lot of them don't even take SegWit into account properly. It's a good thing when the is some pressure from users complaining to wallet developers (and more importantly shitty services like coinbase) that their fees suck. Apparently that's the only way to get them to fix things.


You answered your own question: complain to the service provider/wallet and switch to another one.


Most hurdles have been taken. Gavin, Garzik, fake satoshi, Roger Ver. The flushening is almost complete. Things are lighting up.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:15:50
Because bytes don't cost much. That's why BitTorrent can be free. 
And LN transaction byte-size does not depend on the number of satoshis sent. In fact I think they're constant size.
Opening and closing a channel does cost money, so nodes will want to minimize doing that.
If a lot of transactions go through your node in one direction, then your channels become full or empty and must be closed (or topped up) costing you the blockchain fee.
If you have 0.1 BTC in your channels and someone wants to route a 0.1 BTC transaction through you, then you'll likely have to close+open your channels again, so you want to charge a fee for that.
If someone wants to route a 0.0001 BTC transactions through your node then you're not so concerned and can charge a lot less.
Note: transactions going in opposite directions can cancel each other out, ideally leaving your channels pretty much balanced and thus no need to close any time soon. That increases the number of transactions per channel open/close and thus reduces the average fees for them.
This also means the LN fee is not a direct relationship to the transaction amount, it depends on a lot of other factors. But in general lower value transactions can more easily absorbed and netted while high value transactions can significantly unbalance channels, so indirectly they'll have a higher fee (on average).
Exceptions are always possible: if one very unbalanced channel exists and one high value transaction can re-balance that channel then maybe the node will even offer a negative fee as it's a cheaper alternative to reopening the channel.
Note2: Bytes on the blockchain ARE very expensive.

No. Exploding networks of peers banning each other (BU), completely crazy difficulty adjustment gameable by miners to rake in extra profits through hyperinflation (bcash), and off-by-one-bugs halting the entire blockchain (s2x). All leading to huge losses in funds and confusing the fucking hell out of newcomers, making them easy pray to scammers like Ver.
And then there's the problem that a "simple blocksize increase" opens up an easy DOS attack because scaling of hashing was N squared.
And then there's the fact that decentralization is destroyed by dumb blocksize increases.
All of which was avoided and fixed by SegWit, which actually turned out to be simpler and fewer lines of code than any "simple blocksize increase" ever attempted.

Normally transactions are validated one by one and the result cached. I guess on a low memory machines where the cache is not very effective, some transactions will end up being validated twice.
In blocksonly mode all transactions will only be validated once the block comes in. So probably a 100% CPU usage burst and then relatively idle again.

(just noticed this thread has been removed as duplicate. Might not be worth your time answering.)


Meaning all transactions in that block? Which they've already validated beforehand? Meaning normal nodes would never propagate such a malformed block? I have a feeling I'm missing something.
Is this a case where both transactions using the same input were already seen and cached as verified (individually) but then when the block comes in the check for duplicates was skipped and the block would thus be propagated? Or does it crash even before it gets a chance to propagate anyway?

You're of course very welcome to offer that for free, but remember you'll have to open/close (or top up) your channels every now and then, which costs you blockchain fees. So it might make sense to at least charge a small fee to cover that and prevent a DOS/spam attack on you.
Another way might be to offer it for free until your channel becomes unbalanced (say 20% near empty) and then start charging a fee, so hopefully transactions in the other direction will bring it back into balance.

I keep wondering if it would not make sense to scan the network for hard to reach partitions and then creating a new well funded channel to assist connectivity or just to earn some fees while that new channel drains too (if payments keep going in one direction).

Who ever denied that? Certainly not the inventors of LN in their very first presentation. Nor none of the Core devs. In fact those Core devs just rolled out a blocksize increase a couple of months ago (which was delayed by "bigblockers" for a year) and they were the only devs in the world that had anything to show for, despite that delay and where bigblockers had 3 years to come up with an alternative. Oh and those core devs are working on halving transactions sizes and pushing for other batching optimizations that will further increase those 6 tx/s. And they have another blocksize increase in their roadmap.
So what's you're problem?


False, channel opens and closes can be combined into one transaction.


Except large hubs actually increases the number of opens/closes. It's about the number of possible cycles you can find in the routing graph in order to push money in the opposite direction and re-balance the channels. Inter connectivity is key.

How many changes of a lightbulb does it take to make a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:28:30


But then consider that if the two of us combine our 2 transactions into 1, we'll get an even better efficiency gain: still only one signature and the non-signature part of the transaction becomes smaller (than two the separate) as well.
And then if 100 people combine their transactions? And when a whole block contains 1 single large combined transactions of thousands of people?


Whose requirement? Are they reasonable in their requirement? What time frame are they talking about? Do they demand it yesterday or eventually years down the road? Are they in a position to demand anything in the first place (do it yourself)? Does the universe really owe them that?


Cutting corners and then shouting around: "look at us, we can achieve more" is not sustainable. Strapping some sticks of dynamite to a rockets might make it go fly a little higher too. 


That's bcash, it drops decentralization, so it's not Bitcoin anymore.


Actually it won't. It won't work with anything that doesn't have malleability fixed, so basically anything that doesn't have SegWit, which is pretty much Bitcoin and Litecoin today. All the blah blah about the fixing malleability without SegWit is complete hogwash, as that's simply impossible especially considering their horrible development track record of getting literally nothing right, not even the copy/pasting from Core parts.


As an engineer you know how a CPU has cache memory, right? Do you also complain that your CPU is not a real proper CPU when you instruct it to write to the same memory location a million times, but secretly behind the curtains it actually doesn't and only writes once in the end?
Writing to memory is, what, a 1000x more expensive than writing to local cache memory? Writing to SSD another 1000x. Writing over the network adds another 10x? Whenever there's a big gap in performance like that, someone clever figures out the correct place to insert a cache with the right policies. You can probably find examples of this from Roman days and earlier.
Now you have a globablly replicated immutable perpetual storage device that is obviously freakingly expensive to write to. Even just measured in time it millions of times slower than wrting to your own local SSD. And that's not counting all the other expenses that come with it.
Are you seriously suggesting we NOT place a cache in there?


You can also dishonestly say that writing to memory by a CPU is a whole different kind of agreement than writing using a write-cache backed by real memory. Are you willing to go back in time 30 years in the speed of your computer just because of that perceived difference?


That may be your unfounded opinion. I find that unlikely, but whatever maybe you'll be proven right. Or maybe it will take 3 years before we see a deployed and working LN.
So what?
The people working on LN are independent and different people from anyone working on Bitcoin. Bitcoin progress isn't delayed by them, nobody is waiting for them to finish. You can't stop them working on LN, it's permissionless innovation, and you can't force them to work on something else. The only choice you have left is build a viable alternative yourself, if you can think of one and you can persuade people that it's somehow better.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:57:29
Good, because an empty mempool is a bad thing as the security of Bitcoin depends on the mempool always being non-empty.

It allows bigger blocks, thus more capacity thus likely lower fees.
It does this in a completely backwards compatible and opt-in manner, so people who don't want the above benefits (and many more, like performance and security) are not forced to use SegWit. Those that do, are free to do so and by doing so will actually free up space in the blocks for others.
But those that claim to want bigger blocks, have actually delayed SegWit for over a year and are still today spreading FUD about it and at the same time are still complaining that blocks must be bigger. They're hypocrite liars with agendas ranging from pumping shitcoins to pumping shitforks, like bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:46:09
You're just confusing yourself and everybody by using term wrongly.
A node is a user, as in peer to peer. It looks like you were thinking of hubs. Which are very much disincentivized in LN and which IF they want to be useful at all DO need to tie up capital. A thousand one way channels all pointing towards the hub makes no sense and never provides the biggest benefits LN has to offer: netting (transactions canceling out).
Also, once the user has paid through such a channel, the hub can't touch it other than to send it back to the same user, thus that capital is still tied up. Whether done in the opening transaction or lateron by payments. same thing.

It actually doesn't as a uniform mesh network offers more opportunities for netting transactions and thus keeping channels open for longer and thus lowering the overal fee. One hub with many spokes (fully centralized) is the worst kind of layout. A "hub and spoke" model with many hubs is in between. So there are either so many hubs that the word centralized doesn't apply anymore, or there are so many hubs that it's basically indistinguishable from full mesh.

Ok, so maybe you should organize a group of people to form a test team? Or do some sort of bug bounty? I don't know... I'm not very imaginative. But I do know this stuff is open source and volunteer based, so ask not what open source must do for you, ask what you can do for open source.
That's my point
Thanks for the idea though. Now seems a good time to short BCH, gonna have a look at that.

Depends on how many transactions are in the block.
@_date: 2018-09-18 01:10:20
Blockchain only needs one piece of information from the physical world, the rest is highly constrained and all internally referencing or inconsequential. Sure people can screw up transactions but that's nobody but their own problem.
This is also why things like deeds on the blockchain, eth-like smart contacts or voting on blockchain are all bullshit.
That physical quantity is energy burnt through PoW.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:07:27
Because it makes no sense for a blockchain. Extra complexity, extra storage requirements, no benefit.

He has a shitload of clues actually. You should read some of his stuff.
Generally, his point is not to quibble about blockchain being a database or not, this goes much deeper and is intended to make you think about it in a different light. 
Also: A blockchain is not a blockchain without PoW. That's just a linked list with hash pointers, no need to invent new names for that.
And a database is not something to just store data in, but also make it quickly accessible. The blockchain is not the database, it's merely a serialized dump of data. The database is the UTXO set and accompanying indexes. That serialized dump of data forms the protocol by which said UTXO databases sync up with each other. Those are the bytes sent over the network and then discarded (pruned or archived).

It's all up in the air and probably dynamic for a while: depending on the type of usage and growth of the Lightning network etc.
But what you're suggesting, setting up voluntary non commercial nodes, is definitely a good idea and I will be doing so myself. That helps solve the chicken-egg problem needed to get any network started.
Don't have links handy, but there are 3 independent but compatible implementations in beta testing right now, I'm sure you'll see some more info coming by soon.

Are you saying there is a grain of sense in their brains? I hope (but assume not) that they're blaming the right people for this? (i.e. Ver and themselves)


There is no pushing of open source volunteers. Nor is there anything those volunteers could possibly do to satisfy rbtcers. Because in case you had not noticed, it's not about bigger blocks and hasn't been for years. It's about centralizing power, which our beloved volunteers will never let happen, let alone work towards.

No, we already know it won't scale. That has been obvious since day 0 and has only become more clear. Whether it will be popular or not has nothing to do with it, apparently.

It *has* been increased last august (actually a year earlier, but "bigblockers" sabotaged the rollout). It's currently a dynamic size where the users get to decide how fast it will grow. If users don't want it to be cheaper, then who are you to say they must?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:55




Nonsense. There's no whatsoever sentence. You're just blurting fud memes. Transactions between two parties that nobody in the world ever gets to see are the ultimate in decentralized.


False. The "routing" in the base layer is a full broadcast (i.e. not routing by definition). Sitting in one big restaurant shouting everything you say so everybody can hear is not optimal decentralization (and doesn't scale). Sitting at tables with the people you're interested in is much better decentralization.

The idea of LN is to have multiple channels so a mesh network emerges where you can pay everybody in the world through a few hops. Having multiple channels also means you can re-balance them by sending money to your own other channel, thus not having to settle on the blockchain as often.

But if it makes you feel better we're currently actually in a period of dynamic block size. If people and services want it they can increase the blocksize themselves. No dev or miner needed. No dev or miner that can do them. Permissionless and not gameable.

Know that for every troll there are 10 or 100 or 1000 good people that are immensely thankful for you (plural) to be working on Bitcoin. They do wish to give you the space and freedom to work on Bitcoin with pleasure. They don't demand the impossible from you, they just wait patiently in anticipation for the best that you can create. They want to support you. They do support you. 
It's hard to come up with ways to actually give that support as a big part is simply keeping out of your way. Trying to fund. Trying to code. Trying to do side projects. Trying to learn. Trying to educate (on all levels) others so that they too don't need to get in your way to ask questions or waste your time arguing the same stupid debates over and over. If you have ideas of how people could help more, please throw those out. There's bound to jump someone onto it at some point.
Sometimes, unfortunately for humanity, it seems the loud minority is always destined to fuck things up for everyone. Our history books are riddled with examples.
I have a feeling and hope that particular events over the last few decades are proof that there's a better chance than ever before to turn those tides. I think there are more people than ever working on good causes and their effects are multiplied by better connectivity, better sharing, better collaboration, better openness, better efficiency, more giant shoulders to stand on and more freedom. And there are more people than ever before that get to have a front row seat to these amazing developments.
Hopefully speaking for a large but relatively silent majority. I have immense respect and gratitude for you (plural) and your (plural) work. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I guess it depends a little bit on how it fails and in what way, but yeah you are definitely right. A successor would surely have to include a major improvement that prevents whatever caused bitcoin to fail from happening again.
If it's a technical problem then a technical solution might be invented to counter that.
However if it's a human/social/political/troll induced problem then it's very hard to imagine anything succeeding in its place.
Bitcoin has had a chance to grow up in relatively calm waters with not to many serious attackers. Anything new will surely get attacked much earlier in its lifetime.

It's all smoke and mirrors with false promises. There's nothing decentralized about it (multiple hard forks to roll back thefts and bugs already, but only for those victims who are friends with the top people). The whole "Turing completeness" is utter nonsense and only a buzz words to lure in suckers: it servers no point and only increases attack surface (proven) and inefficiency (proven as it's practically impossible to run a full node on eth these days and it's scaling is many times worse than BItcoin's). It was also premined and launched in a scammy ICO setting. It's only use case was scam ICO's, although these days they're overwhelmed by kitty pictures I hear.

@_date: 2015-12-24 09:15:12
Peter was one of the first to say it would be hard to scale above 1MB. I met him in person 2 years ago and he was already saying it then.
Hard work has been done by several people on scalability, which may have changed his view. For whatever reason he's now on board with the SW doubling. And so are all other core devs. So I couldn't give a fk where you cherrypick your quote from. You're basing your bs on obsolete statements and therefore spreading FUD.
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:45:03
There are some economies of scale that counter that a little bit (heat dissipation is one Peter Todd sometimes mentions), but otherwise: yes, that's what makes scaling so freaking hard.
Economies of scale are less relevant when the scale is still small, whatever "small" means. But the numbers show that even today economies of scale already cause centralization, therefore the scale is already too large. Efficiency optimizations should help a lot, taking away big parts of the centralization pressure, but that takes a lot of hard work.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:12:05
Yes it's most definitely a scam. By a clique of well known scammers.
Users wanting larger blocks is as dumb as television viewers wanting a pink nose cone on the apollo rockets.
Besides, core is the only group of devs that created and rolled a blocksize increase. More than a year ago. The bcash people were the ones who sabotaged that increase for a year. So you're a hypocritical liar as well.

Never heard of it. In general though, with extreme to none exceptions, all altcoins are scams. That doesn't mean they don't promise everything and the kitchen sink, afterall why would you even consider anything but bitcoin if it's not super duper more better than Bitcoin and promises you 10x return monthly? It also doesn't mean they don't go up in value or that you can make some money off them but it's very risky and only the in- (i.e. the scammers themselves) will know when to pump and when to dump, so you're more likely to be too late than not.
If ever a coin actually becomes better than bitcoin, don't worry you'll hear about it plenty early. You won't get in at 1ct but you might get in at 10 bucks... Who cares if it's even better than bitcoin? In the meantime you don't get scammed and don't help scammers scam other people.

Because you just said so:




Except if there aren't any.
But you're completely sidestepping the multiple points, which brings you back to:


Million times nothing is nothing.


Start reasoning from that able then. This is a decentralized system where there is no way to set the fee level. So even if you could determine the optimal, how are you going to set it?


Bitcoin is its own economy, its own entity. BTC is all the blockchain knows about. You can't just pluck information from the physical world. The one exception is a one way fairly reliable communication channel from the physical world into this blockchain universe: the current global hashrate.


BTC has and will have further efficiency improvements that will make it much better than bcash. And it will have LN soon, which bcash will never have.

That's the thing with incentives. They (try to) push the balance a certain way, but they're not a 100% guarantee that everyone will oblige, especially if there are other incentives the other way (laziness is probably a huge one).
And the same goes for those "1000 richest addresses owning 37%". Some of them have incentives to stay quiet and not vote. I doubt for example Satoshi would vote.

Of which eventually, after some magic voting process, only one single combination will get consensus and will actually get to run?
Sounds like an awesomely efficient plan. Please, you start coding the 2-4-8 + SW + Full-RBF version and I'll start working on SW + 2-4 + Full-RBF + CT, okay?

Last year BTC was using basically all the hash power in existence. Today that minority scam chain has a 10x hash power monster overshadowing it. Even a tiny pool could 51% attack this scamcoin of yours.
It also completely unused and unmaintained so no wonder it's 10x cheaper: it's not providing anything useful let alone delivering on its promises. But those running the scam network get paid differently anyway, so would they want to charge neglegent fees if they can just scam suckers into buying their worthless scam bags? Like you by the sound of it.
But nice try comparing apples to rotten oranges.
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:42:33
The point is they can do all that effort now to circumvent the GFW because they're nice guys and want to be part of the global hashing network.  But when shit hits the fan all that stuff is under their control and they can simply shut it all off.

Sigh. You're quoting someone without exact quotes or links or anything.


That's what I said!! 


And capable developers and thinkers. As opposed to copy/paste PHP style altcoin crap.


What makes you think any other coin is going to be better at scaling? If it's impossible in Bitcoin surely it will be impossible in all ripoffs. Oh they made shiny websites that promised everything will be flowers and rainbows. ok, that just convinced me.
If Bitcoin fails you better just pull out of the whole space for at least a decade because it means there are fundamental problems that need another Satoshi to solve.


I see way too few tbh. Most of them probably got tired of the trolls long ago and just blended into the silent majority. Or maybe they went to a better discussion platform without trolls and forgot to tell me about it (here's me hoping...).


Of course not.

Glad you're so concerned with how much of a kludge it is. You must be neck deep in the Bitcoin source code all day long eh? And you are currently doing a line by line thorough code review of the patch?
Or maybe I should listen to Pieter and Greg (the people that actually came up with it and implemented it) saying that the kludge is not that much at all and it can someday be cleaned up by a simple no-consequence hard fork.

If you read the white paper, surely you saw the initial announcement video or one of either of the scalingbitcoin presentations.
@_date: 2015-12-02 01:43:48
Hopefully because they want the best for Bitcoin as well. Which doesn't actually sound unreasonable. They're investing shitloads not just for a bit of profit now. They don't want that to  evaporate tomorrow. But also if the Bitcoin price goes to the moon again, they are the first to profit big from it: the machines are already in place and running and they'll be quicker to scale up production than most others.
But another rational reason would be that they know the Chinese majority might not stay majority forever. As soon as they dip below 50% they're on the receiving end of the orphan rate again. Even though China is a world centre in computer chips and electronics, it's still one country vs the rest of the world combined (due to the great firewall). Odds are the rest of the world overtakes them again. So betting on a 20 year plan up to 8GB would be quite the gamble.

It's ~2x capacity (on average 1.75x currently according to Pieter, unless multisig use grows significantly). And it _does_ increase the blocksize, all the propagation issues are equal to a regular blocksize increase.
Otherwise, I share your enthousiasm. SW opens up a whole new corridor of other improvements, some of which might even improve the propagation issues as well.

And i was explaining that that is only relevant in the bootstrapping phase. And to explain that I'm using the fact that a currently existing p2p network can ROUTE to everyone in the world already with only 8 connections. So in LN you would only need 8 channels (very likely less).

Bitcoin itself. It uses a peer2peer network? Non-listening nodes (the standard if you're behind a firewall/NAT) only make 8 connections? One bitcoin node can send a transaction that quickly reaches the entire world? Anything in there that sounds familiar?
It means in a p2p network you only need a few connections and then you can reach the whole world. So your conundrum is only valid during bootstrapping when the p2p network isn't fully connected yet. Every new connection will bridge the isolated p2p islands until very quickly it's one global p2p network.

I specifically quoted this part of your sentence: "I want to design for the worst case" and asked my question regarding that.

I already pointed out your lies and misunderstandings. This post is again full of them. And history clearly disproves you so trying shit like this is just laughable:


All those random percentages that you spout around only make it clear that you don't understand the basics: miner percentages are irrelevant, miners don't decide, miners only follow. The signalling wasn't a vote. And history clearly proves that: miners followed because they knew that. That you still don't understand because you had your head up your ass when this was explained over and over again doesn't change anything. It just makes you an idiot troll.
Miners work for and get paid by Bitcoin if and only if they can prove they worked according to the rules set by the consensus. They don't have a choice or a vote or the ability to block or go against consensus.
The fact that we asked them nicely and they tried to sabotage doesn't change anything. In fact it turned into an opportunity to prove it. And that's what happened.


Repeating nonsense. 40% of transactions use segwit on the "UASF chain"and not a single satoshi was lost. Again your bullshit is being disproven by factual history.

Reprogrammable means centralized because humans need to reprogram it. If not then it's not reprogrammable but parameterized which means you can make an asic that works with all parameters (or even a subset is enough if compensated by enougg higher efficiency).
There's nothing really hard about optinizing for a sha256 function that takes one extra parameter (from 0 to a trillion).
Maybe you think an asic can only calculate 1+2 all over, but you should realize that it can do a+b and a shitload more.

Extend that thought to include the fact that they're not disclosing because they are either incompetent or outright scamming.

Bribable centralized people deciding when and how to change the algo. Thanks for proving my point: centralising as hell. (And still not ASIC proof.)


IOW: impossible to know. Next time smart asic users will only slowly ramp up usage to pretend they are GPU's. They'll still earn more than their fair share as they are running cheaper. But more importantly that means they will keep their ASICs secret and in house instead of selling them -&gt; biggest firm of centralisation imaginable. And if you change the algo then you kick off the majority of your security and are left with pathetically insecure shitcoin. Which is proof that it's a shitcoin all along "secured" by a charade of snakeoil.


Let me fix that for you: as long as vertcoin remains the worthless shitcoin that it is manufacturers are deterred to spend on R&amp;D.


So you're admitting is not really ASIC proof that were talking about but more like user-proof or scaling-proof. Not just hard to scale like a blockchain inherently is, but purposely actively impossible to scale or grow in value... LOL that IS novel, thanks for the insight.
Timely article: 
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:19:28
The binary itself (deterministically built and pgp signed) is not the only piece of information you have. The other piece is the lack of even a single whistleblower proving there's something fishy with the binaries. You increase the potential pool of whistleblowers by not installing the latest version right away and by picking a project (Bitcoin) that has a transparent development eco system and plenty of different experts around the world. And that's why you stay away from closed and scammer infested shitcoins (always plenty retard exceptions to that rule of course).
It's not perfect nor fully trustless, but it's a hell of a lot better than just trusting a leader.
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:37:26
Fluctuations don't matter over longer period and multiple units. Over a week/month/year you made 20% loss (not less profit... Loss!). So you go out of business.


Nonsense. ASICs will be quicker to take advantage of newer tech because they're simpler and yield and even partial breakage are way less important. A CPU must be nigh 100% accurate and reliable all the time. An ASIC can have 50% outright broken circuits and have the remaining circuits come up with random calculation errors 30% of the time and still be good enough. That means dirt cheap manufacturing compared to CPUs.
It's like having a bunch of dead pixels in a flat panel. A miner doesn't care if even half the pixels are dead (they can be disabled so they don't consume power). Yet any normal users needs all millions of pixel to be exactly perfect. Guess which is easier and cheaper to produce.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:56:02
It's not just that it's 4 years old (you're making a straw man from that). It's also by a nobody and picked up by nobody since. I've heard of vertcoin only by name maybe once or twice in all that time. Nobody uses it, nobody is interested in it, nobody looks at it as an inspiration for good ideas, why would ASIC manufacturers be interested in it?


Well, part of it is his English makes it very hard to read, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of that.


So have I.


This whole discussion whether ASIC-free is possible or not seems to have confused you into thinking it's actually a desirable goal to be ASIC-free. It's actually not. That's the funny thing about scamcoins: they pick Bitcoin and pretend one of Bitcoins properties is a problem and then sell their shitcoin by saying that they have the solution. Usually it's not even a solution (as in this case) but the deeper truth is that it was never a problem in Bitcoin to begin with.
"10 minutes is too long, let's make it 2.5 minutes!" -&gt; Litecoin
"ASICs are bad, we fixed it by being ASIC proof!" -&gt; a 100 shitcoins

Same with GPU miners. In fact easier because you can use the same GPU's to attack multiple coins in succession, raising your chance of success and getting way better ROI. Als on a GPU coin you can lure honest miners away to another better paying coin and then easily 51% attack your target coin.


Oh i see, someone decided to make them temporarily nondecentralized but now they're back again. You clearly don't understand decentralized.


Spare me data on shitcoins I've never even heard of please. I take pride in not knowing the details some scammer dreamt up to lure in suckers.


The fact that you think that's even an argument is very telling. You're the turkey the day before Christmas telling the other turkeys how great things are.


You're saying that the sources are now known? That's very bad, as decentralized mining depends on being anonymous.


I have you several additional attack vectors and other reasons. All I've seen is repeats of temporary single data point guesses.

First of all, it's delusional to think any progress is possible at all without following the advice of specialists. The only hole in that proposition are that it can be hard to distinguish real specialists from scammers and that a specialist might become a scammer.
To fill up that hole as much as possible, you (and any good project/community as a whole) take many precautions, making sure there are as many opportunities (in time and space) and incentives for the largest possible pool of potential whistle-blowers to expose the rot.
For an honest well set up mature project, the absence of whistle-blowing is an indicator for quality and trustworthiness. Of course the absence of whistleblowing can also mean the exact opposite.

Actually it's not. ASICs are a huge investment and they are completely worthless once you succeed in your attack and destroy the network. GPUs remain valueable and can actually be reused again and again to attack the next network.


No they didn't. The centralized switch merely temporarily delayed further attacks (or if people would get their heads out of their asses it would show them that centralized coins are pointless and worthless to begin with and then the attacks indeed stop because you can't steal from something that's worthless).


PoW is done by those who run the ASICs, not the manufacturers of the ASICs. It's bad, but very different from GPU shitcoins and even shitcoins like bcash which can and will all be attacked on a whim whenever there's value to be had.


Repeating wrong statements doesn't make them true. Non-ASIC networks are far easier to attack than ASIC.


Shitcoins are attacked all the time in general, because they're hopelessly insecure shitcoins that are overpriced because clueless idiots buy into the overpromised hype.


Maybe. But then we come to the physical fact that it's impossible to be ASIC resistant. So yet another reason why shitcoins are by definition bullshit.

Yet you do know because you need to define it in the node software. Computers are generally deterministic and a blockchain by definition even more so.


A parametrised algorithm is still one algorithm and can still be optimized for. switch(seed) { case 1; case 2; } doesn't make any difference. Whether you call the IC an ASIC by the current manufacturing standard or by what the sure actually mean of also not going to help you: the "Application" is the set of POW you define. An IC for that Specific Application can always be built.

Nor can they with UASF whixh includes all the added benefits of segwit. Simple choice. Superior and safer and more decentralized and more efficient system for no downside whatsoever.


I can tell you you're too dumb to read, but I've already explained 3 times that they can NOT do that. That's the whole point of Bitcoin in the first place and that this is also true for segwit has been proven for a year now.


No i don't talk for myself. That's the whole point. I'm not talking about my full node or some full node. I'm talking about ALL full nodes. Full nodes in the aggregate. That's why it's called consensus.
But i had to laugh hard because you just figured out on your own how stupid Emergent Consensus is. You remember that retard idea XT or Unlimited devs had and the whole of rbtc was blurting about for a whole year?  That's the genius idea where each node choses their own rules exactly as you describe.


It wasn't a blockchain fork and the fact that it never forked practically proves that indeed the overwhelming economic majority was actually behind. But the beauty of how segwit and uasf rolled out, was that that fact was already blitheringly obvious beforehand as well. Otherwise uasf wouldn't have happened in the first place.


SegWit was already in place, uasf simply was the agreement among practically all full nodes to switch it on and start enforcing it. Nothing more nothing less. Uasf wasn't a change to bitcoin, it was the trigger by which an already agrred upon and rolled out change was activated.


Nope. Not wrong. I already explained 3+ times that miners were 100% in. Any hashers not in were not mining Bitcoin. They were toasting sandwiches. 100% made the longest valid chain and thus even non segwit nodes followed that chain. As a 5+ year old bitcoin version would still do to this day. Even a version fron the daya satoahi was around still follows today's bitcoin chain.
Every time you use that percent sign you have to think "percent of what" and then make sure you're taking about the "what" that's actually relevant and meaningful. At least 99% of the cows in the field and 80% of the flies on their cow shit also didnt mine SegWit. So fucking what?


There you go talking about transactions again. Fucking duh they would be valid. That's the whole fuckups point of being backwards and forwards compatible. That's why soft forks possible at all. Fact is to even do SegWit transactions you'd have to be smart enough to basically code it up yourself and get the transaction accepted by a miner (most if any probably wouldn't even have accepted it) and at the same time a blithering idiot because you'd know it to be unsafe. Creating segwit transactions had nothing to do with uasf or even segwit activation at all. The fact that you still keep bringing that up speaks volumes.

@_date: 2018-05-01 11:54:02
I was wrong on my initial estimation that SegWit would jump to 100% within months. Way too optimistic.
But I've also always thought it's actually good if there's a gradual, *demand-driven* flexibility in block size. This is a bandwidth within which actual users can choose for themselves (decentralized) whether to make use of it or not. In times of abundance they're not in a hurry. When block space is scarce, they are incentivized to be more efficient.
This extra dimension of wiggle room allows for more stable supply/demand equilibrium and is a deterrent to spammers deliberately trying raise fees: they risk having to pay a lot more than they anticipated as their efforts are defused by the speed up of SegWit uptake.
Any future blocksize increase should have this same feature.

@_date: 2018-05-13 21:57:49


I have no idea how you got that idea. I have said nothing like that and frankly, it sounds pretty unrelated to the subject anyway.


You just argued updating to stay ASIC resistant, but now people have a choice? So you're admitting that in fact the coin was never ASIC resistant in the first place and that the move to temporarily annoy ASICs (to pretend to be ASIC resistant) is actually bad because that would split the community.


So again, the coin is either not ASIC resistant or it's "not as decentralized". Exactly like I said.


No. You can't see the difference between more GPU's being added or ASICs being added. Especially if the ASICs are trying to hide it, which just means they will be saving on power and thus still mining more than their fair share.


Well it's not like coin-hopping GPU's provide any real security to begin with, which 10x more efficient ASICs (that are unable to jump to another coin) definitely do. But then you kick them off, so you loos 90% of your security right away. Good job.


Only if they need to hide that fact. If you don't pretend to be ASIC resistant, they don't need to hide and they can sell them to anyone who wants them (i.e. better decentralization).


Yet refusing to draw the only logical conclusion.


Read the article I linked, it goes into exactly that (tl;dr it's easy to make an ASIC that is flexible that can simply be re-configured to these changing parameters).




I like to point out bullshit when I see it. Especially when I see ignorant gullible people dropping money into false technobabble pushed by clear scammers. If my audience doesn't follow my line of thinking then that's clearly my lack of skill in explaining the logic. But then again I'm only trying to warn and nobody is paying me, so in the end: what do I care if they lose their money?
I'm just a road sign along the path towards understanding Bitcoin. A journey everybody, by definition, has to undertake for themselves. I try to warn for cliffs and dangers, while pointing in the general right direction. As opposed to scammers and wannabees that try to confuse and fleece as many passerby's as they can.
In the end all roads end up at either Bitcoin or nocoin. It's just a matter of how many detours people take and many cliffs people fall off before they get there.

CREATING SegWit TRANSACTIONS.
UASF was about activating SegWit VALIDATION.
Can you tell the difference between CREATING and VALIDATING something? Fucking hell.


All they had to voluntarily and indepentently had to do (i.e. were be forced to) is to NOT be assholes trying to steal money. Wow so weird... a decentralized consensus money system that doesn't allow assholes to steal money. Shocking! And full nodes did that and made sure SegWit users were safe. Miners were and are irrelevant in that step. 100% of miners follow the rules set by full nodes. By definition 100%.
Nobody forced them to mine SegWit blocks. To this day, they're still allowed to mine non-segwit blocks. Nobody forced them to do anything with SegWit transactions. Totally free and opt in. The only thing that changed is that they're NOT allowed to try to steal funds. That was already not allowed for a million other situations, SegWit just added one more situation to that list.


So actually yes you can, because full nodes define what it means to mine. Any hasher not following the rules set out by full nodes is NOT mining Bitcoin and therefore as irrelevant as all other altcoin miners. If the overwhelming economic majority of full nodes do UASF, that automatically means that 100% of Bitcoin miners do so and (after a grace period) it's very much safe to use SegWit (just as safe as pre-segwit transactions). As has been proven every day since.


Not if you're not an idiot. It was and never will be "let's enforce this random nonsense change as soft fork". It was "being the overwhelming economic majority, let's get enforce this awesome obviously beneficial opt-in bug fix as a soft fork". But it's funny that you mention that, since that's exactly what fakers like Vitalik did and exactly what bcash did (twice or thrice now?).


Taking something to its logical extreme requires that you understand and can apply logic and have a thorough understanding of the facts. You clearly don't, so maybe you should do yourself a favor and stop trying to draw conclusions. Horse shit in, horse shit out.


You haven't brought up any viable or even remotely possible scenario.


UASF was not a blockchain fork. UASF and non-UASF nodes follow the same chain. The one thing that could have caused a fork would have been a miner trying to steal SegWit funds. All SegWit validating nodes (even non-UASF!) would reject that block, all non-segwit validating nodes (i.e. versions older than more than a year by then) might accept it, but any sane person looking at that situation would obviously see with crypographic proof that the miner was being an asshole trying to steal money. And unless the stealing miner had a majority hashpower the stealing chain would be quickly overtaken by the honest chain anyway, which is automatically followed by ALL Bitcoin versions (all the way back to 2010 or earlier).

No it's not, otherwise there would not be different generations of CPU's or GPU's. If you have an algo that absolutely uses 100% of all transistors equally on a 2016 chip, then it will by definition NOT do that on a 2017 generation chip. Nor will it on a competing brand's chip. Or a version that has a bit more memory or some features enabled/disabled. Or even an overclocked version.
So, it's not just practical nonsense, it's just impossible.


That makes no sense. But did you even read the article? It specifically mentions having special memory that does automatic sorting as an example. Memory chips that do (part of) the PoW algorithm to save on sending bytes back and forth over a bus.


IOW: limiting the value of the coin to the point where it's not worth the effort of designing an ASIC. Nice achievement.


Hugely complex and error prone. Still gameable. And still pointless, because an ASIC can simply be generic enough to implement all variations and still be 100x faster than any GPU.


So what stops anyone from creating a hardware version of that virtual machine?
Your idea uses a lot of sha256 hashes all over the place. What if I make a machine that optimizes calculating that hash? Or even better: what if I design a memory chip that instantly automatically calculates the sha256 of the adjecent memory block. So the CPU only need to read from memory and not bother with any calculation at all?
Anyway, you're piling on more and more complexity and confusion to try to hide the underlying truth. That's not how secure systems improve: you can't paper over holes with more complexity.

These are not transmitters people have in their homes. Instead there are commercial towers that broadcast TV (and other) data.

Your limited definition of ASIC is not helping you. ASICs can do conditional jump and loops just fine. They can be very flexible if they need to be. But even if you want to hold on to your definition, I can take a normal PC and strip all the parts and chips I don't need and I will have a more efficient mining rig with all the same effects as ASIC would have. Same for stripping a GPU.


Except it's impossible to know whether bitmain is doing it, i.e. they go underground and slowly ramp up the hashrate (they have a choice between saving on electricity cost (still driving out competitors) or ramping up hashing rate (driving out competitors). They can do it such that it's absolutely impossible for anyone to detect. Until the centralized devs decide on a POW change and then suddenly 95% of the hashrate drops off and it turns out your coin doesn't have any security at all.


That's ok. And that's what everybody new to this space does for a while. This space is unfortunately overflowing with deliberate dis-information in the form of FUD, technobabble making it hard to see the actual science. Taking technobabble serious and repeating it, makes it so people ignore you.


That is certainly a commendable approach.


I actually do research, I just stop wasting my time the second I hear the first overhyped and ignorant lie. Which is usually in the first sentence of an announcement. I also have a tendency to cross all projects that have a known scammer involved off my list very quickly. What remains is at most a handful of projects that I don't think are very interesting, nor do I think that them pumping their own tokens is very ethical, but otherwise I wish them good luck and just let them be. Monero is one (I can't even think of another right now, but there might be one or two more). Maybe that MimbleWimble implementation, Grunt of whatever it's called.
And then there's Bitcoin. Which I don't pump (and none of the true Bitcoiners do). Which clearly has the world's brainpower behind it. Which was truly innovative and answered a decades old need. Which was started in a unique vacuum in history that can never be repeated. Which has many problems, most of which are known and actively being worked on, as well as some known problems that we'll just have to see if the game theory is well balanced enough to solve them, or not.


Yeah, that's both good (and logical) as well as very scary. That's how nonsense like facebook and the favorite IM-du-jour float to the top. In internet space the outcome is that the stuff mostly hyped towards an ignorant sheep majority wins out, which merely sucks. In digital scarcity space the outcome is that its proof that digital scarcity is impossible. If Bitcoin doesn't succeed it simply proves that a cryptocurrency will be replaced the next day by another, and thus it isn't worth anything. It's game over for all current "cryptocurrencies". It will take another decade and another massive new insight to try again but even then it will have to do without the vacuum in which to go through its early vulnerable phases. We have one chance to have this thing be led by science and the best possible tech. If we fuck that up and give it to the ignorant masses and the politicians, religious zealots and scammers that feed on those masses, then it's just game over.


Yup. But this space is so special that it basically requires that to be the case (as long as it's also technically superior and without fatal flaw). A toppling of the prime mover will be a huge and longlasting setback to the entire space.


Community and game theory (even outside technology) are also fundamental important parts of Bitcoin.


As far as I remember that article explains that too. But maybe I'm misremembering that part. Anyway, chaning POW put people (centralized people) in the decision chair of when to change the POW and what the next algorithm will be. That means huge opportunity for bribes and front-running (tell your buddies at bitmain what the next algo will be a month in advance and receive a $million). And no, it's not possible to make automate this like the difficulty adjustment is automated. ASICs (or call them just "chips" if you think an ASIC can only be a NAND gate) can be built that are flexible enough to work efficiently on any possible POW algo. (This is certainly explained in the SIA article.)

Obviously not.
Your obsession for searching for and comparing shitcoin technobabble merely shows that you're missing the bigger picture. 99.9% of those so called groundbreaking "improvements" are in fact non-improvements. The other .1% might be considered improvements but come with heavy tradeoffs and risk, but even once it turns out to be useful eventually, it will go into Bitcoin anyway.
ASICboost was the huge and unfortunate security flaw in Bitcoin that caused the current Bitmain situation. The situation couldn't have been worse had ASICboost not been possible or fixed earlier. Yes, that's very bad and Bitcoin may still fail as a result from that. Not a single shitcoin is in a better position though.

I feel there's an error in this part:


There are two aspects to supply: 
* Supply quantity is fixed, it's always 1 block every 10 minutes. The blocksize determines the maximum quantity of transactions, not the miners.
* Supply quality is the protection level against attacks.
So mostly in Gavins words it would be: 


quality vs quantity
Now how much of a mismatch of apples and oranges that is, I'm not sure, but it feels to me like standard economic theories shouldn't be blindly applied to it.

You mean fun puzzles and prizes like the DAO (and others) did on eth, right? I will take any bet that says bcash is going to be hackable or DOSable after the upcoming hard fork. I haven't looked for a second at what they're actually up to but that's just guaranteed to happen merely looking at their past historical record of explosions and laughable amateur mistakes.
The 'planned' next hard fork (6 months later?) will be coming sooner to patch up (likely partially disable) broken features in this one.

That you make a distinction between cpu and gpu in this context again shows ignorance.


It's called proof of work. What do you think that phone is going to be doing? ...


The rate of calculations is literally completely irrelevant. That only matters once ypu've settled on a POW algorithm and want compare one miner to the other.


Are you implying getting rid of the profit incentive as well? IOW completely change how bitcoin works?
You really need to dive much deeper into what POW and mining are before making silly statements.

That's not on the lightning roadmap at all. And nobody is unwilling to all hard forks, just braindead ones implemented by political and criminal idiots.
They never supported bcash in the first place, they merely allowed people to withdraw their bcash after the fork happened. So there's no updating here.
Their BTC software is fine, they were among the first to support SegWit. True early Bitcoiners running this exchange. The guy that demolished FakeToshi's cryptographic "proof" within minutes is one of them.

  hmm funny: 
  Double spends are not stealing Bitcoins, they're like paying for something with a check that then bounces. Or like a credit card rollback.
  Nope. ID's and notarization are nonsense. They have nothing to do with blockchains. Opentimestamps.org yes, but that only works _because_ and using the existing blockchain that was built as a decentralized asset. Having only a blockchain without the decentralized asset doesn't make sense and would make the timestamps pointless as well.

What I don't see mentioned a lot, but what I think is important part of it: as soon as there is a fork it means everyone now has X bitcoin and X bitcoin_obama. As soon as ways to exchange bitcoin_Obamas for goods or fiat or bitcoin appear, it simply becomes a free market of supply and demand. That's the actual 'voting' process that decides which fork plummets to 0. Or maybe both survive depending on what the new one has to offer.
Bottom line: if you own bitcoin now you will own coins in the new fork and that in itself gives you voting power.

Like the thing says, they can censor. Which sucks. And, if done at some scale, it basically makes the whole system unusable. The community will then fire the miners by changing the PoW algorithm.
They can't forge transactions or steal Bitcoins.
What they can do is a 51% attack by re-orging the chain, which technically is not stealing Bitcoin but more like bouncing a check to steal goods or services (likely money or other coins from an exchange).

And now there's room for hubs where multiple merchants and customers set up a channel to. Customer sends micro payment to hub and hub sends micropayment to the intended merchant. 
Hub is almost trustless as it can only run off with one  micropayment. Advantage for payer is that they only need to tie up an amount of money once. Advantage for the payee is that they get a nice aggregate stream of payments that add up to a substantial amount. Advantage for all parties: very few total fees.
This is sort of how Peter Todd once explained it to me (minus my interpretation errors).
I guess one hub could connect to other hubs so no need to partition merchants and buyers. No need for one huge monopolistic hub.

I don't take a single word traders say about prices and their reasons for changing serious. They're all full of shit. If they know something they will say the opposite in order to try to affect the price. And usually they don't know shit and still try to affect the price.
On the other hand anyone with a few brain cells can know to not trust these exchanges with a satoshi and expect to be scammed everywhere. So again I don't care at all.
Then the next step that you have not clarified is how them scamming their own suckers on their own platform can possibly affect the price on other exchanges that much. That would mean traders on bitstamp are looking at the price drop on huobi and then panic sell themselves. Yeah even I don't think traders are that dumb.
As long as prices don't vary that much between exchanges (no idea if they do or don't) then that's at least an indication (but not guarantee) that there's not that much scamming going on.

There's no fear of success of Ethereum. Shitcoins like that actually have a positive effect of keeping the retard out and plucking them dry. A fool and his money will soon part.
The "fear" comes from the fact that those shitcoins create monetary incentives for evil anti-competitive propaganda campaigns. They try to improve their own image by shitting on Bitcoin. By spreading misinformation and lies, in order to keep a steady stream of newcomers to pluck. And by threatening Bitcoin and miners and devs to disrupt Bitcoin progress.


Apart from short confirmation times being a complete misunderstanding of what confirmation means and why Satoshi picked 10 minutes, proving Eth to be an outright scam from the start: if that's true, then Lightning Network should be super duper awesome to build Asteroids on. Imagine throwing in a quarter and then for every asteroid that you destroy, you receive 1 satoshi. And the game hardly needs to care about blockchains at all, you can hook up any existing game to it. Amazing.


Ok, exactly as I said then: cards dealt and shuffled on the blockchain. Thus retarded. Thus see above: hook it up to LN like Asteroids above and you have something far superior without spamming a worldwide blockchain that everyone has to download and validate and store.

Nothing false about comparing it to blocksize increase, although at some point the comparison can't be expressed in a "2x" number anymore. For example because CoinJoin joins multiple transactions into one. But it's all scaling nonetheless and increasing the the ability for users to use the system. The end user isn't interested in MB either, hrs interested in being able to use the system. In that way these scaling methods are exactly equal to raising the blocksize (except for the many efficiency and safety gains and other advantages of SegWit, Schnorr, SA, MAY etc.). It's just harder to put an exact number on it.
2nd part of your sentence still holds and is and has been in the roadmap for over a year now. Hardly anyone is arguing against that anyway.

Nobody gives a fuck what software they run, it's the about the rules they validate. Stray from the Bitcoin rules a tiny bit and they are not miners anymore, as beautifully displayed by the BU shitshow 2 days ago. They better be fucking sure they stick to the rules and are therefore completely retarded for risking running anything but the reference implementation.
Miners can't deviate from the rules at all, they have zero power over the rules.
And no, Bitcoin is not a democracy and there's no voting.
The only thing miners can do is refuse to enforce a soft fork (a strict tightening of the rules), at their own detriment (and Bitcoin's) by missing out on fees and holding back Bitcoins growth and development.
Strictly speaking a soft fork can activate with 0% mining support if users wish it. And in case of SegWit that means miners are missing out on a doubling of fee income whenever they don't mine a SegWit block.

Well... because they're invested in that coin and don't want to waste it and start over from scratch in a new coin.
Also, it's highly unlikely that there will be "no hash power" left. That's one reason why (miner) decentralization is so important: if one guy can decide to take 80% of the hash power somewhere else, then yes, that would suck. But if hundreds/thousands of completely independent people from all around the world have to independently decide to go elsewhere, then that's a lot less likely to happen. Let alone instantaneously and for nefarious reasons. The old coin will move on, albeit crippled. But if Bitcoiners stick with their investment and don't let themselves be suckered into a fork then the miners that left will very quickly go bankrupt or come running back.


Try to forget about the exact name. Everybody and his dog will be claiming to be the real Bitcoin. It will be confusing as hell. But also quite irrelevant. Either forget about the labels altogether and call things A, B and C. Or call the exact set of rules that Satoshi left us with "Bitcoin", and anything that is not exactly that set of rules is not Bitcoin but, depending on the context, either an altcoin, or "Bitcoin 2.0" (but only a complete full consensus can reach that, otherwise you're back to square one). 


Yeah, I just pointed out to him that it's about much more than just propagating blocks (his conclusions are still correct though) :


What's (short term) best for or can be handled by an individual has no bearing on what's best for the whole network (long term).


They just did a few days ago.


Nodes with different rules (like block size settings) are effectively not fully validating (as they are ignoring the 1MB rule). By not fully validating they are endangering the whole network because they are an easy target for a partitioning attack. For example: If the invalid BU block a few days ago had been mined by a malicious attacker, then all those other BU nodes and miners would have accepted that evil block and actually HELPED the attacker to prolong his chain. So if if BU had 10% mining power, the attacker would only be facing 90% of the total hashing power actually protecting Bitcoin, and at the same time get +10% on his side helping his attack. A 51% attack is suddenly done with only 35%.
A single individual not fully validating all the rules is not a big deal. A larger number of nodes all not validating the same rule and loudly advertising that fact for all attackers to see, is a big danger to the whole network.
Same reasoning shows that any alternative node implementations are not a good idea, as far as consensus rules is concerned. The value of your money depends on the homogeneity in strict validation of the rules. Anything less than exact equal rule enforcement reduces the security and therefore value of your money.


Thanks for being open minded and good luck on your further explorations.

Look, i know this stuff is too complex for you but the statements are being made in different contexts and perspectives.
First of all there may be a more PoW valid Bitcoin chain out there already in the basements of the NSA, waiting to go public any day now.
2nd: you can call every altcoin a hard fork. Those happened mostly at the genesis block, a few happened later. Although that captures most of what a hard fork actually is, it's a pretty useless definition.
In the end the only thing that matters is whether **in the eyes of the Bitcoin software itself a hard fork ever happened**. That's all the software can see of the world anyway.
And the answer is, you can feed the current blockchain into any Bitcoin version from Satoshi days up until today and ask will agree that it's valid. The strictest and most useful definition of a hard fork would show a break line halfway through the chain where old software wouldn't agree anymore.
It doesn't matter that there have been a million orphan blocks and even a few short parallel chains. In the eyes of the Bitcoin software they don't even exist other than a simple re-org.
Which is another way of proving this: a reorg is not a hard fork.
Now from the perspective of a BU node during the Ver fuckup: there definitely was a hard fork: they found a block (and were hard at work making follow up blocks) that old versions would not have approved of and thus in their blockchain a hard fork had happened. They hard forked themselves off the Bitcoin blockchain into a short lived (duh) BU blockchain.
And that probably happened to a thousand other malconfigured miners too.
Similar thing happened with the 0.7 to 0.8 thing. Some miners went off onto a non-Bitcoin blockchain that Satoshi's version would not have validated. Those miners soon gave up and went back to mining Bitcoin again.
Put on your Star Trek uniform for a deep dive. We've just discovered a life form that lives in mostly weird dimensions of virtual space and feeds on virtual blocks.
Everything in the universe is relative, like Einstein said. If you are the life form called Bitcoin, you transcend the time dimension, you're both the today's version as well as Satoshi's version. Your location is inside many computers at the same time. Not just spreadout or distributed, the one entity is present in each of those computers simultaneously. Sometimes one computer freezes or dies or stops being part of you but that usually doesn't matter as there are plenty of others. Some computers are running the latest version with the latest block. Some are behind. Some are even just starting at block 1, trying to catch up. They're all you.
Whenever you stumble upon a bunch of blocks, you independently trustlessly determine whether they're part of the Bitcoin blockchain (if those blocks are valid and part of the most work chain) or whether they're not and you can completely ignore them.
But another fact is, you will never get to see a Hard Fork happening. Time is just slowing down as blocks are mined less frequently and then difficulty goes down. Maybe it will be abandoned so massively that time crawls to a halt before difficulty can adjust. But then your time dimension IS the blocknumbers ticking up, so you can't even know if that stops. You may see the difficulty going down but you don't know the cause. Maybe humans nuked each other, doesn't mean there's a hard fork out there.
If there was a hard fork then that means a new entity was born, BitcoinNew, which starts following the hard fork chain. BitcoinNew is fully independent of the old Bitcoin entity. No communication, no overlap in location, new separate time dimension. BitcoinNew though knows full well that it has a hard fork in its history: the evidence is in the blockchain. Up until block x use these rules, after that, use these new rules. No old version exists that can validate the whole chain. Satoshi's version is not part of BitcoinNew. It can deduce that something lived before it, but that's it. BitcoinNew tokens are completely separate from the tokens of its predecessor.
So both the statement that Bitcoin has never undergone a hardfork and a statement that Ver did a failed hard fork can both be correct. In fact they're both correct by definition, as long as Bitcoin exists.

Agreed. Currently big miners have 2 unfair advantages:
They have access to hardware 1) cheaply and more importantly 2) early.
As the growth rate is slowing down and that curve flattens their time advantage is reduced. If hardware can operate for several years then one month delay is not such a big difference anymore.
At the same time the hardware becomes a commodity, affordable and accessible to everyone. Hobbyists running them at break even to heat their homes or even at a slight loss for the fun of it will be eating away the profits of the big farms that still have overhead costs. Reducing their profit ever closer to 0.

Didn't say I was surprised. For one, it's way too early to be surprised. SegWit is still on track to be activated. 


Haha... you got sybil attacked. A few dozen trolls in rbtc pretending to be a significant portion of the bitcoin community and some ignorant sheep that fall for thier propaganda? Most don't even own any significant number of Bitcoins if any.


No. Every rational person fully saw that this was an awesome solution where literally everybody would get more than they even wished for. Bigger and safer and more performance and security and decentralization. Everything is in there.  But then the next day the goal posts shifted and the propaganda machines went into overdrive.


I explained that already. It's a waste of time. Ultimately if SegWit doesn't activate Bitcoin will die and a brand new technically much superior (with all the mistakes and oversights of Satoshi, including SegWit, done right), probably built by the same people that are now Core, will arise and overtake Bitcoin. Either as altcoin or sidechain.


There are no hubs in LN. You're showing a big lack in understanding. The LN market will be much tighter and more decentralized than Bitcoin mining with much lower barriers of entry and cost. Fees are in proportion to the amount of bitcoins locked up in channels, not to how early you get into the system.


Nothing "sudden" about that. This has been known and obvious forever. LN was invented before SegWit. The fact that you happen to pick up the wrong information and only later learn the truth isn't very surprising: there is an infinite amount of lies and misinformation coming out of Ver &amp; co. Everybody goes through that on some points.

Without SegWit there's a quadratically scaling component so 4x would mean (worst case) 16x longer validation times.
libsecp256k1 achieved a 7x speedup in validation speed, so imagine the current 1MB blocks 2 years ago.
There are hundreds of other such improvements done over the years in efficiency of CPU, memory, disk I/O, caching and bandwidth. Now imagine current blocks 2 years ago. You mention 2 to 3 seconds. Without all the optimizations it would probably have been 2 to 3 minutes if not more. 
Truth is Bitcoin would have screeched to a halt with all 1MB blocks 2 years ago but thanks to hard work it can now keep up. And this is just talking about performance. Security and decentralization are actually more important than (although somewhat related to) performance.
SegWit adds and prepares for some more significant performance (and security and decentralization) improvements, so most devs agree that with that it's safe to increase the blocksize. Which SegWit does.

Hard fork attempts are attacks. A successful attack is proof that the system is vulnerable and not trustworthy and this not safe to put money in.

I was very careful with my mail analogy, because obviously 1to1 email is different than a blockchain that stores everything. But you just blew the analogy to shreds without attempting to see the point.
Luke already covered your point in his first email as well as a few repeats: by getting involved in bitcoin you're consenting to all financial transactions. That means not JPEGs or bibles transcoded into fake transactions or even worse: dust.


You need to read that again, it doesn't say what you read into it.
He's saying even if 1 person doesn't consent then it's spam. (With the knowledge that running bitcoin in the first place by definition means you consent to all financial transactions).
I'm not saying i fully agree with his definition but we're taking about as huge grey area here and whether it's 1 person or a 100 or half or 90% is actually all the same and therefore irrelevant. So his black/white stance of either everybody consents or they don't actually makes a lot of sense. Especially when establishing principles. You can always argue about nuances and details and great areas later on.


Well there is some influence we can have over what people can and can't do. But not much. See the whole op_return discussions. But yeah people will do what they want in the end. But now you're moving outside of what the definition of spam is and into the realm of how to do policing/filtering of that spam.
Personally i think it's extremely difficult already to distinguish from non-spam today and that's only going to get harder as Bitcoin becomes more private and more fungible. Eventually it's only going to be the fee that can prevent spam from going out of control. SegWit helps there by making spam sensitive areas of transactions a higher weight per byte than less sensitive parts. So SegWit makes spam transactions relatively more expensive and honest transactions relatively less expensive.
That doesn't mean that his criticism of everybody who is or was making spam transactions is invalid though.  You can have a perfect spamfilter on your mailbox and never see his emails, but that doesn't make that Nigerian prince any less of an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:45:01
Inputs are the larger ones as those need to be signed and signatures are large. Schnorr makes them smaller and Signature Aggregation will aggregate mutliple signatures into one signature, saving a lot of space there again.

That's the problem with the FUD trolls. They try to use "A" as well as "not A" as arguments against something. The only thing you can do is point out both are lies, which is usually easy since when you zoom in on "A" there's always a wrong assumption or some misinformation or lie or conspiracy. Afterall rbtcers have no clue what they're talking about.
In this case they have a conspiracy theory that SegWit is purely for LN to make core rich and drain fees from miners.
Obviously bullshit on multiple levels. One is that LN can be done without (and was invented before) SegWit.
On the other side they'll claim to be pro LN suddenly, but not with SegWit because LN can be done without SegWit. Well that's obviously bullshit too.
They can't really adjust either of their claims to incorporate the rebuttals because then the claims would sound lame to even the worst 911 truther out there. They need the lies for the drama

It's not so much that i think bitcoin will be the solution to all problems. But the fact that for the first time in history we might get this apolitical tool so fundamentally different than anything ever before. It might serve as an anchor giving other good projects a foothold and an example.

Your "you.. by default" is quite confusing. Makes it easy to misinterpret the sentence. "By definition" is probably better. Or change not use "you".
Anyway. Wrong on soft forks: Soft fork means no split, but it still means you have to opt in. Soft forks are backwards compatible, so if you don't upgrade your software you won't use it. If you don't take any action you just keep using the old system and you'll be fine. No action is already opting out.
If you really are very anti the soft fork then you can decide to do a hard fork yourself and then it in to that (via point one).
BTW thanks for being respectful to nullc (and others) and asking questions on the form of questions. He's doing a great job explaining things and it looks like you're progressing quickly. That's quite uncommon in rbtc.

Everybody is free to try. But they are attacks and need be defeated. The ONLY thing a contentious hard fork can do is prove that it's unwise to put wealth into cryptocurrency, thus therefore the whole field is pointless.
- Such forks are inflation (doubling of coin supply) at the very least.
- They are also proof that the rock solid stable rules that Bitcoin promised are not rock solid at all. They can be changed on a whim by some populist retards. So the store of value function completely breaks down and no reason to invest in Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) anymore in the first place. 
- Then the evil hard forks partition the community and network and therefore the security, making both sides vulnerable to all kinds of hash power related attacks.
- And finally it creates incredible chaos and loss of value (on both chains) for a lot of people. Through replay attacks, through confusion, user error, price volatility, scams and other attacks.

That miner is just creating worthless random bits. Wasting a shitload of money on electricity and what comes out is worthless. And he's not getting a loaf of bread for it.
Seriously... If ELI5 like this didn't make you get it, i really doubt anything will.

Fees that only go up after SegWit. More transactions, more fees.
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:53:47


There is no competition.
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:30:01


Even with your few bytes larger transactions (which will be compensated 100x over by Schnorr, SA and MAST which SegWit opens the way to) SegWit blocks will be able to go larger than 2 MB and thus still contain more transactions than a 2MB hardfork.
Anyway, maybe retard was a bit too strong, sorry about that. I thought I remembered you from rbtc talking shit there, but that may well have been another throwawaynumber, as there are many around (and some do know what they're talking about). You can decide for yourself which you are.
Either way, your statement (2MB HF fits more transactions than SegWit SF) doesn't make sense, even if you're taking a few insignificant bytes into account. Sure you said 2MB SegWit, but make it 2.05MB SegWit and we're already equal again.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:57:45

Yeah. That's exactly what's happening. And miners can do that because there's no way to force them to take only the highest fees. Which happens to be the exact reason they are able to censor transactions. If we could force them, they wilt be able to censor.
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:15:31


Yes they are, you're giving them the power to completely destroy and steal it. Or are you saying you're just a shitcoiner that doesn't even have Bitcoin to begin with?


Fucking duh they do. Or do you always let 5th graders build the applications on which you do your banking?


By the unqualified fucks mentioned above. And it hasn't been tested or peer reviewed at all. Oh and btw, it's a braindead idea from the very beginning based on a false assumption of how Bitcoin works. It fundamentaly cannot work!


Too bad nobody thinks you matter.


Yes it does. And even more to miners.

No advance would at least prove that bitcoin is unchangeably stable, which on itself is an excellent property for a money.
But it's quite possible that 1MB and shitty 2nd layers is simply not enough to make it interesting for many people or many use cases. Certainly not cups of coffee.
The other non-SegWit option is endless failing hardfork chaos, infighting and mining wars. Quickly dumping the bitcoin price and having everybody with a brain leave the scene.
And in the impossibly tiny chance that a hard fork does gain some sort of majority then bitcoin has failed by definition. Experiment over with conclusion: non-political money is impossible, try again in a few decades.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:40:20
I can receive coins through SegWit and then send them to you still on an old client.
SegWit is perfectly backwards compatible. You can forget every lie you've heard about it and reconsider.
Currently there is nobody who has a single actual valid argument against SegWit, so everything you've heard that is against SegWit is simply a parroted lie. Unfortunately there are nefarious characters that are actively feeding lies to newcomers and ignorants, to get them to parrot those lies further and confuse others. You're falling for their ploy, you're being puppeteer-ed.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:58:42

Sigh. The fact that you have to be so pathetic to again bring up this million times debunked garbage merely proves that in fact no it doesn't apply to core. At all. 
I haven't seen a single lie by any of the core devs, except Hearn and Gavin.
And if you want to keep lying about what was agreed and promised and voided in some HK meeting by some individuals (that's 4 counts of disproving your allegation in one sentence) then that's completely your problem.


Have you been sleeping through this one as well when it was explained to death back when it happened?
No test net is not for blowing up. It's also pretty trekking that when you blow it up, nobody even notices for more than a month. That proves you weren't even testing at all. It's also telling that instead of acting professionally they start denying and whitewashing (like you're doing here) and then continue to just to put the whole code and pretend it everything's fine without it anyway.
Rest of your post is also lying bullcrap. You can go figure out for yourself how core never forked and certainly not for 16 blocks and how Ver is bribing miners to run BU and pumping Monero and other shitcoins and dumping.

Of course not. He's never admitted to being wrong ever. Not even those many times he would single handedly have destroyed Bitcoin with 20GB blocks "trust me, I've tested it all, works fine, don't worry".
The way you know he was lying and completely out of his depth is that he silently drops his idiotic proposal and doubles down on the next one. "Classic is it. Trust me. drop Core, follow me."

Quick Litecoin pump and dump never hurt noone, right? Except a few suckers of course.
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:45:03
BU can't work and doesn't work. Ever. It's completely flawed in every possible manner: basic understanding of how bitcoin works, assumptions, idea, design, no peer review, implementation, security, consensus, politics, religious brain-dead supporters. This has been proven many times and is completely obvious to anyone giving it some thought, but some rare idiots with agendas keep promoting it with lies and misinformation.
One proof is simple and honestly if you don't understand it then you're simply a waste of time.
BU starts by assuming miners decide on consensus rules. That's completely wrong and obviously not the case in Satoshi's Bitcoin. That's not what the white paper says. And it's just blatantly retarded.
So assumption is garbage, hence everything built on top of it is garbage. Period.
No ifs or buts possible. Complete garbage.
That's how science works. If that screwed with your pink unicorn dream. Tough shit. The universe doesn't owe you anything.
Come up with something innovative or GTFO.

@_date: 2017-02-18 19:25:40


Yup and SPV turned out to be impossible and doesn't exist. So assumption gone, everything after that and depending on that assumption invalidated. Too bad, but that's how science and the universe works.


You quoted a quote on a forum from years later, not "the original design". Therefore false.
In fact the original design contained the foundations of SOFT forks. Provisions for smooth backwards compatible upgrades. Those have been improved a lot over the years by Satoshi himself and later devs and they've in fact been USED a lot by Satoshi and later devs. Clearly Satoshi was planning on using soft forks whenever possible. He just didn't know yet that almost everything is possible through a non-contentious soft fork.


A successful hard fork the new chain would be Bitcoin. The old chain wouldn't exist at all anymore. That's what non-contentious hard forks do. And that's the whole point of a hard fork.
The problem is that retards like BU and the likes trouble the reality by trying to push for contentious hard forks that split into multiple chains that then need to war it out.

@_date: 2017-02-15 00:42:32
Technically, yes. But it's much more complex and less flexible/useful.
One of the inventors and very active developers of LN:
@_date: 2017-02-04 01:07:43
Didn't say you were lying. I said parroting, meaning they're not necessarily your own lies. Someone presented them to you as criticisms and you're repeating them here as such.
The lie is in the fact that they are not valid criticisms.
Yes there's a discount and I've explained exactly why and why it's a good thing and even nigh unavoidable to get incentives away from the current unhealthy imbalance. The lie is that it's anything near important enough even mentioning, let alone that it's a criticism.
LN is a whole different category of improvements. I'm its biggest fan. But I was replying to the 3 bytes increased transaction size, where the techs I mentioned will at least halve the size of transactions, but actually make 1000 transactions combined into one with the size of maybe a 100 today's transactions. The lie is that even mentioning those 3 bytes as a criticism is petty and pure FUD. Totally insignificant in any scaling discussion, especially since it will soon be completely wiped off the table by huge improvements.


That's absolutely right for sure. Not the exclusive arguments, but a few of the many.
And yet more proof that "bigblockers" just moved the goal posts the second they realized that their earlier demands (2MB!) were about to become more than real. Now nobody even knows anymore what they actually want, the only thing we hear are FUD about SegWit and random sound bites of fake, impossible and retarded demands.

Nothing no brainer about it. Fast and cheap (as in crazy blocksize which you're no doubt hinting at) means it doesn't exist at all. For nobody.
So it's a no brainer to make sure it keeps existing first and then we'll see how much will be on chain (which is nonsense anyway) and how much will be off chain in various forms (most of which are no brainers).

They're actively trying to keep dummies from listening to them. I'm not making a judgement here, just explaining one of their tactics. If you think their show is shit then possibly you just don't get it. But i admit there might be other reasons, like being easily offended.

It's not so much that they don't improve network health. The problem comes one you start counting them with the assumption that all nodes are equal in decentralization and then you start friending on that to make decisions.
If you want to measure decentralization (which is impossible but you could try to get some bounds through statistical means), you want to stay on the safe (wrist case) side.

Ok so 16 is too much. What makes you qualified to judge the difference between 16 an 4? You're just bikeshedding with random numbers. That's not how science works and not the way to change a $15B live system. There are actual academic peer reviewed studies, at least one that specifically mentions 4MB being too much, even based on studying only a subset of the relevant variables.
Anyway. No need to worry. Further updates after SegWit will halve the transaction sizes. So there's your next doubling.

Not literally but they're even more ignorant and anti science than that.


They are. At the same time that's extremely stupid to do as it undermines the security of the network and increases risk for everybody including yourself. As was proven (again) 2 days ago: had there been a malicious attacker that had created that larger block then BU miners would have blindly HELPED that attack. With 10% BU retards that means the attacker only faces a network that's already 10% less secure than the hash power suggests, but on top of that, the attacker gets a free 10% assistance. A 51% attack suddenly only requires 35%. Thanks a lot BU.
All that electricity "wasted" on security but then we just leave part of that power (that we paid for) for any attacker to just grab and use against us. Total lunacy!
People are free to run what they want, it's just hopelessly irresponsible and thus outright stupid even just considering their own risks and incentives. Let alone when looking at the network as a whole (which affects the price and this their own bottom line again). Scientific proof that people are far from rational.


Except that majority is not measured in hash power or number of nodes or number of people or anything like that. It's majority of economic strength which can't be measured. If the bakery around the corner only accepts real Bitcoins then you'll just starve to death no matter how much hash power BU has or how many Sybil nodes they set up our how hard they scream in their echo chamber-o-stupid.
@_date: 2017-02-06 02:04:26




That's exactly the hard fork you just said they won't do. I'm confused.


Yeah and only a single group of devs has actually done the work and come up with a solution. The other gross have been suckering you with promises of unicorns for years but have produced nothing at all. And now they've pivoted to abandon their promises and are actively trying to block larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:48:01
Running it at home is better than hosting it at a third party, as that involves trust and if multiple nodes trust that same third party then things aren't as decentralized as they seem.
Even if you just run in pruning or blocksonly mode, you're still helping. You could even run it only at night time if you want.
@_date: 2017-02-04 01:43:07


You make that sound like it's a negative thing. First of all a too fast would be very bad as it would cause a fee market shock. So slow is good.
Now how slowly? How about "as close to the perfect speed as you could possibly wish in a decentralized system"? That's what SegWit does. It goes exactly as fast as people need the extra space. If they don't care about current fees then they won't need the extra space and take their time to upgrade. If they want the lower fees they'll upgrade quickly.


And your better plan is to force people to upgrade and ram it down their throats even though clearly they don't care enough or don't want it? How does that work in a decentralized system? If it takes 2 years to reach 2MB then clearly people don't care as much and don't need the bigger blocks (putting BigBlock-whiners to shame). If on the other hand people do upgrade people do upgrade at a reasonable pace and we do reach 2MB within a year then FUDders like you are put to shame. (And funnily enough there's a big big overlap in BigBlock-whiners and those FUDders.)
And as a double whammy: FUDders are complaining it will take too long, but are also blocking it, so it will take even longer.
And as tripple whammy: Despite years of empty promises not a single alternative exists and won't be ready and activated even within 2 years. So you're complaining about maybe possibly slow adoption, if people don't want it out of their free will, while the non-existent alternative that would force it down people's throats will not come any sooner.
You see why rational people are fed up with the bullshit and shifting of goal posts yet?

Liar. Non updated miners can just keep mining even after SegWit activates. And generalising that lie to all soft forks and making it sound like there's any pressure, let alone attack, at all is an even bigger lie. FUD.


Liar. There nothing inherent about soft forks and 95%. That could have been any number. Even 5%. The 95% is just a number that was picked to get a high minimum safety for upgraded users. Also there's no attack whatsoever. Nobody is being attached b in the SegWit soft fork. And if you want to compare it to something that actually is an attack: the deceitful 75% activation threshold of Classic, which because of the way it's measured will activate with only 65% is a straight up attack and buttfuck for at least 35% of the community.

That's not how secure systems work, let alone ones involving money.
Your logic is literally lying to merchants "don't worry it's fine, there's a buffer" and then in a few months/years criminals discover that those buffers are only pretend feel good.

Yeah. I think i mentioned that.


And this can not be done with Bitcoin... Why exactly? I guess because the Bitcoins are actually worth something, but other than that...


So the cards get shuffled and dealt on the chain and every turn gets confirmed on the chain etc? (If not then see asteroids.) And the point of all that on chain is what exactly? So the whole world can (no, is forced to) verify that your game of blackjack was played fairly and that you won? Whooptiedoo. Any reason why you don't just play a while evening and then tell us your earnings in one transaction and be done with it? And if you really don't trust the house or the other players, maybe do it through Lightning Network where every move is a lightning transaction?
And there's the whole reason why eth was a load of shit from the get go. Blockchains already don't scale so adding more trivial bullshit is not helping. But more importantly Turing completeness is just buzzword bullshit. Every smart contract except transferring the internal tokens requires communication with the outside world (everything outside the blockchain itself). So the smart contract is partly offchain by definition. So you might as well do all the inefficient overhead of computing the smart contract offchain and then report back the outcome in a transaction. That way the smart contract only needs to run once (or twice if there are two participants in the contract that don't trust each others computations) instead of thousands of times on all nodes and all the extra global communication and perpetual storage etc.
But i guess building a lightning network like smart contract platform with Bitcoins going in and out, had one big downside for Vitalek: there are no coins to pump and sell to morons in a crowdsale.
Microsoft and software... You sound like a 20 year old missing 30 years of history.
Long story. But MS mostly had success stories with stuff they bought and then built on a little and then cornered the market as monopolist. Once there they'd simply do the occasional update and suck the market dry while bullying and screwing over any competitors. Embrace and extend was one such way. Lawsuits were popular too. All kinds of illegal sales practices where vendors were not allowed to sell products by competitors etc. Hardly anything was a result of the quality of their software and usually I've the competition was killed off the product didn't innovate at all anymore.
These days they have to deal with a lot more competition and they're actually losing a lot of the battles forcing them to become more compatible (as opposed to anti-compatible before) with other products and open standards.
But given the size of MS and the number of startups they buy and fresh PhDs they hire, I don't really see much exciting coming out of it. Not more than IBM, Google, Oracle.
Their blockchain gamble is just their way of having a foot in any new up and coming fad. They missed out hugely on the internet and had to scramble to get back on track. They missed out even more on mobile phones. All big companies try to have their fingers in everything new so on the off chance that something exploded they're close by to buy up some startup. That also makes them gullible and easily fooled into spending some money.

There literally is none. It's all complete lies and scams. There's not a single reason that can be remotely based in anything resembling science. So we're back to flat earth shit. We'll just have to see if this is the dark ages where rational people end up on the stake. There's enough utter retards with pitchforks ready, that's for sure.


Only to people that can't see through the lies and misinformation and false allegations from Ver &amp; co. So yeah, if you want to make this a propaganda war and gives on who brainwashes the ignorant idiots better, I guess so...


That's the false choice those liars think they can present to ignorant noobs. Simply promise golden unicorns and the idiots come in droves. No matter you can ever live up to those promises, you can just blame that on the other side.
They've been promising the sky for two+ years but have not made a single line of well designed, well tested, peer reviewed and bug free code that works towards that goal. Not a fucking single line. Everything is shitly designed, thrown into the live network without any form of testing and then explodes a little while later.
In the meantime Core has actually delivered more than those false promises in a safe and sustainable manner.
The answer to that debate question is: Bitcoin can be both, but only when the right people get to work on it and with the correct layering.


That's a bullshit unfounded proposition. Those are required to fix a fundamental flaw that is the imbalance between UTXO creation and destruction, leading to excessive UTXO growth (one of the biggest bottlenecks of Bitcoin). They also make simple sense as a much better representation of the cost of different sorts of data. Not all bytes are equal cost. It makes perfect sense to have to pay less for one-time-check and throw-away signatures as opposed to transaction data that needs to be kept for eternity. Also, there's totally no reason to even care about it, it's not like anyone is worse off compared to the status quo. Everybody benefits.


Everybody wants that. Core wants that. They've been working on that for 5 years at least (in contrast to BU and Gavin just shouting some bull and claiming it will just work without doing any actual work). That shit is hard and a lot of other things need to be fixed and be in place before such a huge thing can be considered. SegWit is actually a big part of that. But even after SegWit, it'll take a while to come up and implement the best method which is not gameable or extremely dangerous (both of which BU is). But until then there's plenty more scaling in the pipeline, like Schnorr and SA and MAST, so there's still plenty wiggle room.


Yeah agreed, except in the process of that "emerging" brain and economic power is partitioned making both halves much less useful, valuable and secure than the sum could be, plus one side is eventually going to lose a lot of money. Now if there were really two scientifically long term viable alternatives and the only way to figure out which is best is to try both.. yeah sure, then you'd might want to do that. But we already have plenty of proof that this is not what BU even thinks, since the honest way to do such an experiment is to do it as a sidechain or altcoin. The fact they're trying to rip apart a working system and do a hostile takeover on it is plenty proof of scammy intentions. If sidechains or altcoins are really to difficult for these retard devs, then at the very least they could come up with an honest hard fork proposal. Well designed and tested, proven quality. And then an honest activation period and threshold that let's everybody enough time to think and update and chose. Instead they try to ram their one sided buggy shit down everybody's throat with a completely irresponsible 75% threshold (which is very deceitfully implemented, meaning it will actually activate at 60% or lower) and to hell with whoever doesn't agree or isn't ready or has old transactions that are now invalid or any other reason.

It's a huge change in consensus system. It hands all the power to the miners. It destroys many of the current incentives.


Conveniently leaving out the word "valid" there. Points to complete misunderstanding.
Bitcoin incentive structure is a very delicately balanced house of cards that can barely stand as it is. If you misunderstand any of the cards you end up with wrong conclusions. If you start ripping out the bottom cards completely you have nothing left.

I just recently finished The Dictator's Handbook (audiobook). Highly recommend it. For one it's eye opening to see how the world of dictators and democracies and companies are all fundamentally guided by relatively simple incentives and logic. Throughout all of human history. 
But 2nd, it's fascinating to imagine how Bitcoin could possibly drive a wedge straight through that whole incentives web and cause a rebalancing of incentives.
For better or worse, to be honest. Messing with incentives may have counterintuitive effects, as we bitcoiners surely know. But I have high hopes.
Or maybe I'm being too Andreassy now and it will just be another tool like the internet and the mobile phone.

Well i assume you are that crossing that safely border would not be very smart. Problem is that border is quite fuzzy to begin with but going into centralized land is a lot easier than the way back: one a powerful miner has a lot of control they won't easily give that up. We're already seeing that today. Another problem is that we don't really know how close we are to the border. Luckily through all the hard work done so far the border itself has been moving up, which is what's making the blocksize increase by SegWit possible to begin with.
SegWit makes further updates easier (like Schnorr, MAST and Signature Aggregation) so it will become easier to creep closer to the border in small steps (and at the same time push the border out further). Those techs are quite well advanced in the development and deployment phases. 2 or 3 are already in elements alpha if i remember correctly. Where SegWit also came from.
And lighting is going to be huge for write caching all the small coffee transactions.
Instead of insisting on crossing the border carelessly in the only spot we used to know, SegWit started this quest to fan out along the border itself, exploring and pushing it out where possible and now we're about to close in on very exciting new border crossing that might let us pass safely in rapid pace.
I don't worry too much about altcoins tbh. I worry about them being swamps for newbies to get stuck in and get scammed giving the whole space a bad name. I worry about them being a financial incentive for believers to attack bitcoin (to scam more or to protect their own bad investment). For example eth is going down the shitter when people (finally) open their eyes to things like LN and whatever improvements to the Bitcoin scripting language SegWit will open up.

@_date: 2016-03-21 23:01:17
You get a discount on the transaction fee if you use a segwit transaction instead of a normal transaction. Roughly half of the bytes in a transaction are signatures and with segwit you only pay 25% fee over those bytes, normal fee over the rest of the bytes.
This is because the signature bytes are less taxing on the network and stored outside the normal 1MB limit, thus freeing up space for other transactions (segwit or not), so it is preferred and incentivised to use segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:42:48
You shouldn't believe what idiots with a hidden agenda tell you. That's clearly NOT how he designed it. Only power grabbers that wasn't too bend the rules in their favour misread the white paper like that.
Also there's no need whatsoever for a hard fork. SegWit dives more than any hard fork proposal (which aren't even implemented yet). And soft forks happen to have be en invented and used exclusively by satoshi himself, in case that still matters to you.

Except users would quickly sell all the coins of the network they don't support: if you don't believe in it you might as well profit by selling them. Both sides sell the "other" coins, so the exchange rates for both (in USD or in Gold or whatever) plummets. 
People anticipating this might even decide to quickly sell coins of both chains. Further accellerating (or even triggering) the rapid fall.

Lol onchain asteroids. Really now? I bet is not rendering every frame on the chain, so therefore there's nothing on chain about it. Which nicely proves the point of ethereum having no point at all: on chain can only enforce virtual tokens anything else needs trust and oracles anyway, so it's a complete waste to pretend to do that onchain.

No you moved the goalposts a day after 2MB turned out to be actually possible when SegWit was announced, more than a year ago. The bigblock demands were exactly 2MB back then. During the announcement it was extremely clear that SegWit was going to be the thing that have everything to everyone who wanted something. Literally everything. Block size increase to the Classic morons and all the security and performance updates that sane people had required before accepting any increase.  There was literally nothing left to complain about. Everybody was relieved as clearly now the trollery could stop and people could again go back to work actually improving Bitcoin.
Until the next day when the lies and misinformation factory went into overdrive and the goal posts moved miles away. In fact, they disappeared completely. Nobody even knows what the demands are anymore. Troll masters like Gavin and Roger and a few others clearly didn't want to lose their freshly acquired powers over their troll slave army.

You've been fed lies. That's not how SegWit works, nor is that possible.
For one: ff Bitcoin were to be reversed 2016 blocks (plus 150 blocks per day that SegWit is activated), which is required for your scenario, then Bitcoin would have bigger problems than just SegWit.
Unlike what rbtc liars think, miners are not the ones protecting Bitcoin against such an attack. Full Nodes do that. Pro-SegWit are already in the majority today and that will keep growing, and will reach near 100% after SegWit has been activated for a while. 
Just like with previous soft forks, which activated in exactly the same manner and weren't reversed either.
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:12:25
Probably because it's a lot of extra work and a less clean solution that's all wasted when SegWit activates. And since SegWit makes so much sense that it's unimaginable to the logic mind that it won't be activated, why waste that time?


Of course not. It's free and open source and decentralized with extremely low fees. The only thing devs can hope for is to eventually become a sought after expert consultant when companies need support with some LN solution.

@_date: 2017-02-04 01:17:47
Sounds logical on the surface, but I don't think it is.
Even if you don't want the block size increase and forget about it completely: then still a 1MB SegWit would be inferior as it does not fix the consensus bug that is the UTXO creation/destruction imbalance that exists today.
The 4:1 ratio nicely fixes the imbalance, but you can't reduce the 1MB non-segwit size (without hard fork).
Well, I guess 1MB SegWit is better than no SegWit, but it would be a shame not to fix that wart. Strictly there's no reason to wait until Oct 2017 with such a proposal. Although having two mutually exclusive soft forks up for "vote" at the same time is probably a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:57:45
You do realise that a soft fork doesn't break any of the rules that you originally agreed to, right? Even the first client Satoshi made will be perfectly fine with the new transactions and blocks.
Soft forks don't need consensus, those that don't want it can keep using the old rules just fine. Just don't be assholes by trying to spend our op_nop transactions. That's all that this signaling means: a promise by the miners to not be assholes. Op_nops that were added by satoshi for exactly this purpose, mind you.


Maybe. Miners roadblocking anything for political reasons certainly aren't legitimate. Politics may not okay a role in political money. Also blocking progress doesn't seem legitimate either.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:40:00
Fees go down a bit, but total fees (with twice the number of transactions) will more than make up for that. And there's all reason to believe usage will also go up if fees go down a bit. There's plenty of demand. That's one of the reasons we need a healthy fee market with full blocks in the first place, to make these things predictable.
Also SegWit won't just be an instant increase leaving a gap that then needs to be filled (like a naive HF would). It's a gradual increase as users slowly update their wallets and carefully start trying to send and accept SegWit transactions.
Yeah maybe miners are raking it in. Fees are around 10% of block reward now? Imagine if we'd want to do a similar thing in a few years when fees are 50% or more of the block reward. Fee market needs to be really stake and predictable by then.
Taking it in seems a bit shortsighted to me, but they might be right. I'm sure they're looking at the numbers.

You're so full of shit. Soft Forks are decided by users, not by miners. Percentages don't even come into play. If an evil soft fork gets attempted by miners it's the job of the users with full nodes to not go along and if necessary do their own counter soft fork that turns the evil soft fork into a hard fork.
Conflating any of this with a 51% attack is outright lying for FUD purposes.


Wow. New FUD. Congrats for pulling new shit out of your ass. The double spends your talking about are called re-orgs and don't have any jack shit to do with soft forks. In fact the way you describe it wold even be a hard fork. But that's just because it's a retarded description.
And then you sum up some other stuff a centralized mining ecosystem can do and somehow try to associate that with soft forks. Again nothing to do with soft forks. That's just a failure of decentralization and therefore the end of Bitcoin. Something Ver and co are writing very hard to achieve.


Not just can. Should. Must. Will. That's because power is with the users, not with miners. But again Ver and co are writing hard to undermine that by taking all the power away from users and placing it with miners.


A malicious soft fork is simply an attack on the network doing something evil allowed under current rules which everybody already agreed to. Fucking duh it needs coordination to tighten those rules for whatever loophole was overlooked by satoshi.
Your generalisation "evil soft forks may exist, therefore all soft forks are bad and i personally declare soft forks forbidden" is completely retarded and won't change a single thing. Evil people don't give a fuck about what you declare forbidden and can still do their evil soft fork.
So again, you're just making shit up and referencing all kinds of unrelated attack vectors and try to associate then with the term soft fork with only one goal: make people scared of that term. That's called FUD and you are the fuckwit doing it.
Also: name one evil soft fork.

You qualified them as "valid" and then you were requested to name them.


I seriously cannot understand how that would ever be a problem. Preparing the foundation of the current sytem to be flexible to be able to slide in future tech smoothly. That's the way to prevent spaghetti code and getting stuck where the new tech can't possible cooperate with the existing system anymore.
And "hypothetical conceptual future technologies" is very much not true anyway. Most of these things have been invented years ago and have been further designed and even implemented over those years. Most are already in live code in Elements Alpha or other places. Just like SegWit itself existed (live) for almost a year before it was announced for Bitcoin. Most of those techs 
Scaling is precisely this: cleaning up code and preparing it for future enhancements and features. Any moron can change a 1 to a 2. Getting the code ready for that change so it doesn't explode on the first day in the wild is what takes brains and hard work.




I was talking about CoinJoin here. Exists for 4 years now maybe? Nobody uses it because it's a bit annoying with malleability and there's no financial gain, only privacy improvement. Guess what SegWit does: bye malleability. Guess what Schnorr and SA do: make a transaction with 1000 signature the size of 1 signature. That means huge financial gain (as well as scaling). No real new tech there. All of that is already live either on Bitcoin or on a sidechain today.


You're quite a bit behind. LN Whitepaper is 1.5 years old now? Payment Channels existed before that and are proven. The actual transactions that LN does have also been done on live Bitcoin. And first version of LN is working and you can go test it on testnet.  That's pretty far from:




That's straight up dishonest. You've been giving dozens of points of things that are direct improvements that SegWit provides right away as well as in the months after. Then there are extra points are *existing* features that have been waiting for years to get into Bitcoin. It was hard and low priority back then because there was much more important work on Bitcoin to do first. But SegWit fixes a lot of those high priority defects as well as makes those other techs much much easier to integrate.


I'm not in a hurry. The bigblockers were in a hurry for 2MB for years. But since SegWit was finished, that demand disappeared into thin air. 


That's not rational at all. If code is inflexible spaghetti today and you clean up your shit to make it more flexible then others (it's open source afterall) will suddenly think of new things to do and find it easier to integrate them. That's how you get progress. But for SegWit that's only one extra unimportant benefit. The other techs are already ready today.


Pleae be careful. Also: they've forsaken their name. They're not bigblockers anymore. They're blocking bigger blocks. SegWitters are the bigblockers now.


Fees and backlog have (almost since the beginning) and will always exist. In fact, they must exist for there to be a healthy fee market. The only complaining about it are cheapscapes that want to offload their costs for free on others. 
Tell them SegWit is a block size increase and will give fees and memory backlog some breathing room. More than a 2MB hardfork would.


They're wrong. Core wants even more than they want. Core is just aware of the laws of physics and nature and knows how hard it can be to navigate them. They are realistic and don't go straight for the unicorns.


They're right. See above.


2.1MB and growing.


Fuck off with the deceitful quotes. It's literally blocksize increase and it's more transactions (blocksize is a bullshit measure anyway, it's all about transaction rate).


Except they are increasing the blocks more than Gavin's BIP (which doesn't even exist anymore nor was ever implemented).


Sure, twist some more words upside down and fuck them sideways.

No. Most known devs already said they'd stop, but it goes without saying. They're not in it for the money or leisure activity or fake or whatever.

They're certainly not the slaves of some random armchair redditters that already pissed on them.


screw you over. Exactly. IOW your investment isn't safe, thus better not invest at all, thus price tanks.
You're extremely gullible thinking this is going to be some utopia democracy where only good things get decided. Bitcoin is not a democracy, the second it becomes one it's doomed.
After every expungement of some minority there will be the next minority to fleece.
Those in control will get rich of insider trading while the sheep get fucked both ways.
That's what you get when you introduce human corruptive nature into any system. The scammers are quick to learn and repeat from thousands of years of human history. The day politics enters Bitcoin itself, is all over.


Oh wow. You mean like instant inflation? Gee and here's me thinking i invested in a deflationary currency.
And then you're pretending the two tokens live in a vacuum and are completely disregarding the price of those tokens.
And now i get to gamble which coin to sell to earn back the value i had before (minus the value already lost because insiders were quicker to sell than me, even before the fork started). Best to just sell both sides and wait it out: oops lots of people before me had the same thought and both prices already tanked (even before the fork started as there are always people with insider knowledge ready to make a quick buck).


Bitcoin can adapt just fine and still remain true to its original promises. SegWit proves that, it adds features and enhancements and performance increases and security and scale without breaking any rule set out by satoshi.


The idea behind digital gold is rock solid, unchangeable, timeless. All that good stuff. Not adaptable to every of Ver's farts.


There's only one outcome where Bitcoin wins long term and that's when people move back to the original chain. That would count as a victory proving that Bitcoin is capable of defeating political attacks as well. Just like it bounced back from many other attacks like mtgox. But the evil fork better be small and die quick otherwise it might take decades to heal.
Note how scammers are likely still winners in that situation. It's the gullible sheep that always lose out.

Spammy evil miners could potentially make 4MB blocks but they sold actually contain get transactions (i think) and a lot of garbage. They'd also be wasting fee income, so there's not much reason to expect that to happen. And if it does there are easy fixes.
Yeah. Last i heard was 2.3x transactions. Plus lots more with Schnorr, SA and MAST (with actually relatively smaller! blocks)..

The fact that you think that and are not enraged by it (gloating even) clearly shows you understand jack shit about bitcoin incentives.
Miners work for and are paid by users. Refusal to do their work would be a very bad sign of a power imbalance.

So not a compromise then. Just going from completely apeshit wrong to a new wrong.
I'd love to see that admission BTW, in my memory Gavin never said anything but just blamed it all on Core and came up with his new shit.


So, yet again. Not a compromise. Yet again the position was proven to be apeshit retarded.
All in all, nicely homing in on the target size that most knowledgeable people were thinking of for years already anyway and then came SegWit which would exactly reach that goal and then it was rolled out and then... oops goal posts gone. Turns out it was never about the size anyway, it was purposeful drama and power grabbing.
@_date: 2017-02-20 23:05:14
Yeah was thinking about that. But then you get the problem of false signaling. If you pay early adopters more (even if you could identify them, as miners are in principle anonymous) then they'll just signal the bit but not really support the actual feature. At least in the naive ways I could come up with in my 10 minutes of thought.
You want something that would work as a reward in the future if and when SegWit activates. If it doesn't activate they all get nothing. You probably can't reliably tell which miners were first or last and you don't want to incentivize false signalling. That seems to leave only adding bonus fees to SegWit blocks after it has activated, smeared out over several months or a year or so.

In a soft fork by definition you can opt out (in the form of not opting in, so opting out is the default if you don't do anything). Soft fork means compatible with old nodes. Old nodes can keep running. 


In the case of SegWit that would be really silly of the recipient as they'd just be throwing away money. They don't care as long as you pay the higher fees (which are higher because you're wasting more precious block space).
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:40:03
Except there is no censorship, only claims about it, which is simply an attempt to confuse ignorant people to assume something's being hidden. Congratulations, you feel for it.
Even if there were censorship, you'd find actual arguments against SegWit on one of the many many other forums. Yet you can't, because none exist. Which nicely confirms there is no censorship.

Apart from your point being balony, there's no need for doubt on this issue then:
'I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.'

Like nullc just said: he only got that invitation after the code was already public and destined to the competing, hostile and bitcoin-attacking fork. Why would he waste his time on it? Because open source obliges him? Not to steal the code for use in Core, that's for sure. It's completely uninteresting to him anyway since he proposed a far superior solution already months ago.
As for whining Gavin, even IF he is not lying about that claim, he fully deserved it. He has proven himself time and time and time again to NOT understand the attack surface of Bitcoin and how to do adversarial thinking.
He could be (have been) a decent engineer doing good work on Bitcoin, but he completely disqualified himself as a guru.

I never contested the 4 open channels. Nor does opening one channel every 3 months contradict that. Decentralized also does not mean that every single user must be a hub: as long as there are plenty nodes acting as hubs then the decentralization benefits will be had.

Too bad core has data and logic to back up their claims. Classic has nothing but an armwaving gavin that has been proven wrong by his own data on 3 different armwaving occasions already. (All prev block size hostile takeover attempts: don't worry trust me, i tested everything, 8GB will be just fine...)
I would love there to be another dev team. But any competent dev so far has just joined core instead of starting a competing team. Why compete if your pet much in consensus anyway and there is plenty of opportunity to get your ideas heard.
We HAVE 80 independent devs competing AND cooperating at the same time.
Oh and btw core are also ok with a 2MB block size increase and are currently rolling it out. So none of your claims and points makes the slightest bit of sense. But don't worry, you're still doing better than most classics.

Then Schnorr comes. And Signature Aggregation. And MAST. And more of that on chain scaling stuff. And then a hard fork or extension blocks if hard forks are too contentious. And in the meantime Lightning will roll out.
That's all clearly on the roadmap of more than a year ago now.
Also: Blocks will always be (and have practically always been) full. That's the whole point of having fees. The question is only what size blocks the network can safely handle without centralization problems. We'll grow to that max size. SegWit does that.
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:03:53
Well, AS is a whole different thing than CoinJoin. It saves space the more inputs you have in the transaction (even in one person's normal transactions).
CJ is combining multiple people's transactions to try to obfuscate whose coins go where. Users of CJ get a bit more privacy but it takes a bit of effort to do and therefore hardly anyone does it and therefore the privacy benefit is relatively small anyway. 
Successful CJ requires enough potential partners to join with and if subsequent transactions are not done with CJ they can undo the privacy effect of the CJ.
But now combine these two: if you do CJ+AS your transaction becomes cheaper! Now there's an incentive for everyone to do CJ as much as possible, even for the lazy people who say "I have nothing to hide anyway". So there should be many more potential CJ partners.
Add to that that AS actually makes finding CJ partners easier because the communication beforehand is simpler (no need for complex back and forth: just give the partially signed transaction to the next person and let them add their own).
Eventually when blockchain analysts try to trace coins, hopefully they'll get stuck trying to deobfuscate many subsequent CJ steps. That provides a huge improvement in privacy and fungibility.
And it also increases the transaction capacity of whatever size blocks well have because the transactions are smaller.
Win-win-win for everybody.
@_date: 2017-02-15 09:05:31

Which is actually quite rational and I'm tending towards more and more as well. The difference between 1MB and 2MB is practically nothing anyway. Still a shame that all other awesome features of SegWit don't get activated though. Those are actual improvements.

You're not making very clear why that wood be a problem at all.
Because if nobody uses SegWit transactions then we'll still only have 1MB blocks? How unlikely is that though? And if that were the case then that's very good proof that nobody gives a fuck about the "high"fees and is too lazy to update. Hardly a problem then.
As soon as people do use SegWit transactions half of the bytes of each transaction will not count to 1MB anymore (as seen by old nodes, new nodes don't even check for 1MB anymore).

Seems like nitpicking. And it is. But we're talking about trust/trustless here and the security effect that a "home run" full node that is guarding some share of the Bitcoin economy has on the whole Bitcoin network and economy. Each individual is almost insignificant, but all (or at least "enough") together are what is the Bitcoin network and provides it its security against evil hard forkers and other attacks involving invalid transactions/blocks. (Miners add security against different attacks (and there's some overlap), but that's off topic here.)
The problem comes when we think we are secure but then it turns out X% of people are running their nodes on a few datacenters/clouds and then the government steps in to install malware on their servers, or forces them to be shut down etc.
As long as there's healthy diversity in manners and places of running full nodes we should be good. And a few cloud/datacenter based ones are even a plus then. As long as not everybody is going for the same provider, especially if that's predictable/detectable by the adversary. I guess that's the meaning of "decentralized", it's required on this level as well.
Thanks for running a full node. It's certainly better than not running one at all.

I don't know if anyone did that analysis (might be trivial for people that fully understand statistics, i.e. not me). But I think you're looking at the 1000 -&gt; 2016 change slightly wrong. It's not really the accuracy that you need to pay attention to, but the chance of variance (luck) changing the outcome of the vote. The change has two effects:
1) Taking the average over 2016 blocks instead of 1000 blocks. Yes that increases the "accuracy" which also means that in the old situation variance had a bigger impact.
2) Sampling only once in the window instead of checking every block in the window. Again here: in the old situation variance had a bigger impact.
So both effects actually reduce the impact of variance. Both effects add up, they don't compensate. 
In short 95% in the new situation really means 95%. While in the old situation you could say that 95% actually meant 90% plus a little variance (which was certain to hit +5% eventually) and people knew that so that's why they set it to 95% in the first place even though they were aiming for 90%. (All number out of my ass, I'd expect the difference to be smaller too.)
Well, I wouldn't call stating that one is a little concerned about X, to be a discussion about reducing X. Especially if you consider that X used to be 90% (in above example) and is being raised to 95% and the person is concerned about the increase, not so much the level.

That's dishonest squared. "We need a change yesterday because the world is coming to an end!" times "Don't worry, blocks won't be bigger, because no one needs them."
Not to mention the fact that "no one needs them" completely ignores the adversarial angle: today's spam attacks make full blocks and it would make big 2MB blocks pretty much just as easily. As well as 8MB blocks.
Today's attack proves how cheap it is. If a 30% miner spends that amount of pocket change to force x% of miners to drop out because they can't handle big blocks plus increase everyone's orphan rate a tiny bit, guess who wins?
And you know what else the spam attacks (current and last autumn) prove?
 * Blocks aren't full yet, there's plenty of space for cheap spam.
 * The world is not ending when blocks are full.
 * A rise in fee is actually necessary, as the bearers of the cost of the spam are NOT the ones receiving the tiny fee associated with it.
Oh and if you think you haven't wasted enough of hard working people's time yet, congratulations:

And another difference is that a 2+MB block solution is ready today, with another bunch of performance and safety features as well as opening up further such future developments. That's not scaling than was ever realistically dreamed about by xt, classic and bu.
Anyway. End of discussion. Not wasting more time on you. You can do your own homework instead of parroting rbtc bullcrap.

If they do then it means your investment is not safe at all as the next altcoin will overtake it. Which means you may as well not bother at all.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:13:48
Sorry, can't be bothered to look it up. Maybe it's in the SegWit FAQ. I got it from some research from a few months ago. It makes sense when you consider that signatures are slightly larger than the rest of a transaction. So for normal transactions roughly half of the size gets a 75% discount regarding counting towards 4M, where multi-sig transactions contain more signatures so a larger part of them get that discount. Multi-sig usage has gone up steadily, so the total blocksize under SegWit would increase too compared to the initial safe estimates of 1.75MB when SegWit was announced.
In the end it's an insignificant difference that only rbtc trolls care to FUD about, as it's a dynamic property anyway. It won't jump to 2MB on day one but grow steadily. Maybe it will take a month, maybe a year, to reach 2MB. Depends on how eager people are to reduce the fees they pay.
Also, after further future updates, large parts of those signature data is going to disappear completely: Schnorr signatures, Signature Aggregation and MAST all reduce and combine signature data. Those will also incentivize people to combine multiple small transactions into one larger (but more efficient) one, through CoinJoin. Both for lowering fees and improving privacy. By that time SegWit blocks aren't really comparable to pre-SegWit blocks anymore, as both size and number of transactions don't mean anything anymore. Blocks may well be smaller than 2MB but contain more than 4x the number of todays transactions.
And that's even without mentioning Lightning Network.
@_date: 2016-03-19 01:45:10
Yeah this would have been a silly idea even in 2013.
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:09:57
Yup all those properties are not boolean. Uncensorable is another one btw.
Trustless: if i only trust anything with 6 confirmations and i have alarm bells when a 6+ size reorg happens or when no new block appears within say one hour. Then as long as the alarm bells don't go off in pretty darn trustless. When they do go off, i shut down payments in and out until i have gathered more info on what's happening and how to solve it: yes that requires a lot of due diligence and time and eventually some trust, before I can resume operations.
So on trustless we're pretty good, except when decentralisation is bad and long reorgs start happening: then my alarm bells are going to drive me mad.
Uncensorable is another one that very much depends on decentralisation. A few miners can be coerced or be evil and censor transactions, a more diverse larger group is way better. Luckily technical solutions like CT and LN and combining signatures can be great helps here too.
So yeah it mostly comes down to how decentralised does it need to be, as all the other properties at least partly friend on that. Which is confirmed by looking at the extreme case: centralised turns the whole thing into an extremely inefficient paypal, so might as well call it quits.
Problem is of course that decentralisation is not really a measurable number even if we were to know what threshold we want to aim for. There are clues though. Validationless mining is definitely one because it's measurable by looking at the empty blocks and analyzing timings.
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:38:37
Except the claimed 75% is just smoke and mirrors to deliberately fool you. The threshold is programmed such that it will hit on a peak of some variance instead of honestly averaging it over many blocks. In other words it's statistically almost guaranteed to activate with only 60 to 65% and a bit of luck.

You seem to be saying SegWit transactions are twice as big? That makes even less sense than what throwaway said/meant.
A 2MB SegWit block means double the number of transactions. No point in quibbling about 1.99x or 2.01x, it's not that precise anyway since transactions are not all the same size anyway.
Also, SegWit blocks can go bigger than 2MB, so then it's even more obvious more than double the nr of transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:49:01

That's what the website claims, but as all their promises: it's a lie.

@_date: 2017-02-12 04:00:33


It's actually used to disprove the claims by rbtc nutjobs that core plans to destroy bitcoin by taking all transactions off chain. And their spreadng of the lie to ignorants that they can prevent that by blocking SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:28:30
Blocks were pretty much always full, the demand has just been increasing so people are paying more.  Which is exactly fine.
But SegWit increases the block size, so miners can put more transactions in, so their total fee income rises.
You seemed to be implying tha SegWit is not activated because miners are making a ton in fees. If fee was the reason, they'd have activated on day 1, as SegWit will only increase that.
@_date: 2017-02-14 04:10:15
Except that SPV was still supposed to be trustless but turned out to be impossible. Doesn't exist. SegWit helps us get closer to that, but not all the way by a longshot. So users do have to run full nodes to be able to use trustless money.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:52:17
You're completely blind if you haven't seen them. On all of my points. But even a single proof on one of my points would disqualify BU completely regardless of the other points. So you're just proving to be willfully blind here.
One random proof: it's untested. It even blew up on testnet without anyone noticing and no further tests were ever done.
Another random proof: complete lack of peer review. Yeah that's a bit hard to prove, since there isn't any to point to, but there you go.
Another one: wrong assumptions. They think hashing power decides the validation rules, which is a clear misreading of the white paper and not how bitcoin works.
There's enough proof to keep going all day long.
@_date: 2016-03-20 16:23:39


That's what i said and explained why. See below too.


That's why hard work is being done splitting of the wallet code from the rest, possibly in the future resulting in (wait for it...) separate projects.


I was talking about more than just modularity. I said "add-on". You don't recognise advantages of having separate informant projects with their own developers (overlap allowed) and their own pace of development and release schedule. Possibly different programming languages. No chance of one bug bringing down the other system.
All those were very true for FBRP. Experimental, high flux quick successive releases with sometimes major changes and the occasional bug that didn't affect Bitcoin itself. None of that needed months long discussion and consensus building (the fact that that is necessary for Bitcoin and many other large projects, doesn't mean it's the ideal method to quickly get something off the ground).


He has. Many times. Your not the first to ask (I'd even say it's one of the items on the troll checklist). Unfortunately i haven't been able to find a link, I'm on phone atm. But can't hurt to do some homework yourself, you can't expect people to reexplain everything from the ground up to every newcomer.

If classic gets its way SegWit will never get in. They don't want it now and they don't have the required dev skills to implement it later.
So you are promoting breaking something now with the promise that when in 3 years something like SegWit is in, we can start thinking about a solution that partially plugs that hole again. That sounds so good, where can I invest my money?
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:27:26
You can crawl back into your ratholes now. I'm done wasting time on you.
You keep twisting words and moving goalposts.
But what it comes down to is that soft forks are within Satoshis rules, by definition. Normal soft forks people can just ignore and evil soft forks they'll have to counter by doing a soft fork that makes the evil impossible. Users decide. The fact that mining power is required to make a soft fork usable doesn't mean miners decide.


You are just completely hopeless in your misunderstanding of Bitcoin.  This has absolutely nothing to do with soft forks. Those miners don't need a soft or hard fork. They just do a re-org. You just completely disqualified yourself here. And proven that your just FUDding.


Bitcoin doesn't work if you violate one of its security assumptions of decentralized mining. Clap clap. You discover that all on your own? The proof that BU is evil.


I already told you to take it up with Satoshi for overlooking security vulnerabilities and even actively enabling more soft forks. You already accepted these points the moment you bought bitcoins.




Sorry didn't see any, likely because your stupidity hurts.


So you bought into a coin with this gaping and unsolvable security hole where it can easily be soft forked into uselessness. Stupid you. Quick! Sell!
(And again proof that users ultimately decide.)

The only alternative Satoshi provided in the white paper (SPV) doesn't exist because it's currently impossible. SegWit would help a lot in getting there but even then running a full node (or SegWit style light full node) is the only way to actually use and own Bitcoins trustlessly.
Also there are ways to run a full node with "only" 6 x 24 x 31 MB download per month by running blocksonly mode. So 100 GB is not tthe important number.
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:43:39
Complete bullcrap filled with FUD and untruths. As per typical rbtc ignorance.


It's not an attack at all by definition as it follows all the rules as set out by satoshi. You've already agreed to these rules when buying into Bitcoin, including all imaginable soft forks. And study forks are always backward compatible so starting behind is always an option. FUD.


Dramatic political statement based on nothing, residually in the case at hand. i.e. FUD.


Nothing higher about it. It's just a soft fork which stops smoothly activate if the soft fork you're rallying against is evil. FUD again.


Which is complete nonsense sprinkled with some sugar to fool the ignorant.

That's what checkpoints (used to) do. It adds a bit more trust into the devs. Can't really explain the intricate details right now.

Math doesn't sound right tbh. Haven't looked into details, but at first glance the &gt;50% chain should quickly tend to become the longest with 100% certainty.
However, that's quite irrelevant because after a contentious HF it's not a matter of the longest chain anymore: there are 2 independent longest chains. 2 currencies. With all the chaos that that brings for exchanges and merchants and owners. Plummeting prices for both chains. Scams and double spend left and right. 
Add to that the (at some point likely attack) where a miner does fake support but then switched back after the fork happens.
Actually i would love if someone did the numbers on that, but looks like if i have 30% of hashing power i could trigger the HF and then switch back, leaving the 45% mining monopoly mining and this almost doubling my own income (which is pure profit without extra cost).
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:28:39
Bullshit. You're just FUDing.
All SegWit transactions strictly follow the rules set out by Satoshi. You can fully validate that.
It's like a group of people deciding that they only accept dollar bills if there's an X on it in invisible ink. If you don't know about it, you still accept my dollar bill and don't care. It's still a perfectly fine and valid dollar bill.
Are you suggesting making a law that makes bill invisibly marked X invalid? You can do that, but that's a hard fork. So good luck.
People using SegWit simply have an agreement among each other to make some rules stricter, but that's their right and you don't need to give a fuck about it. You don't even have the right to stop them, if you could. I can go do it right now today and you couldn't stop me.
Or are you suggesting censorship now?
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:54:46
Almost all core people have been explaining every little detail of everything countless times. Here and in forums and on the dev mailing list, on IRC in Youtube video of conference and meetups. If you want knowledge all you need to do is look around a little bit and read/listen.

Thanks for taking the time to respond to this (by now) old thread.
I understand I haven't convinced you, but I'm pretty sure I have heard/read multiple devs (over the years) say that validationless mining is bad for security. I've convinced you on one point, you said, but even if my other points have not (and even if they are flawed) to me it makes intuitive sense that validationless mining is bad, so for now I'll trust the devs saying this. (And I know that ones intuition often gets turned upside down in Bitcoin, I've had that happen many times.)
Anyway, I'd advice you to keep your eyes open and sooner or later you'll run into a debate that includes one or more core devs and it might become clearer there, or I guess you could ask them for more details. For example: Peter Todd is currently working on patches related to this that will become relevant when SegWit gets rolled out (as SetWit makes validationless mining (i.e. lazily not even downloading the signatures, or (temporarily) withholding the signatures as part of an attack) an even bigger problem.
I found this thread with you quite interesting, I've learned things myself trying to get things straight and worded correctly (even though I failed for a large part there). Unfortunately I don't have the time to do a proper simulation and more research into this topic. I might think back to this thread if I ever run into some proof or more in depth points and might drop you a message. Thanks..

Better have something that doesn't pay directly to individual miners, as that disincentives the first miners and means the last 1% miner will have the power to demand ridiculous bribes. Maybe a pot of money that will automatically pay out as bonus fees (to all SegWit blocks) smeared out over a few months after activation.
On the other hand. Miners work for the users and users can fire them if they don't do their job properly.

Just remember, even if you're the majority this time, next time is going to be your turn to be buttfucked by politicians and scammers luring the "majority" into doing something stupid.
Nobody is going to invest in something where 10, 20, 40% of the community gets pissed on every few years when some populist comes along to fix the rules of the game. Bitcoin will be dead! Money needs trust and rock solid rules.
The only way forward for Bitcoin is to defeat these attacks. If it gives in, it loses.
And these attacks will keep coming, stronger and stronger. Bitcoin will grow massively stronger itself after each victory, but it only needs to lose one single battle for it all to be over.
That's the only way to reach true immutability: immutable against human stupidity.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:53:04
No blocksize increase ever will have that effect you're seeking. You better quit Bitcoin now if you think that is required and expect it ever will.
10x is nothing (and impossible today, maybe in future).
100x is nothing (and impossible today, maybe in far future).
1000x is nothing (and impossible today, probably also in far future).
10000x is nothing (and impossible, probably even in the very far future).
100000x is nothing (and impossible, period).
So take your pick between impossible or 2x to 4x (plus a shitload of more important features and enhancements and preparations for further growth) today. Both are nothing.

Ok years :)
I agree it's hard to find exact data. I have come across some every now and then but I'm not organised enough to keep good track. I should try using bookmarks again, probably haven't used them anymore since google.
It's always going to be blurry data at best though. For example it's quite obvious that mining centralisation is quite bad at the moment. But how do you put that into a number? How do you measure improvement? And as soon as you do, what stops a large miner from pretending to be 2 smaller miners. Does your number now change?
I have seen numbers that clearly show that orphan rate grows with block size (smaller blocks less often get orphaned, which is actually a statistic you can measure with some effort). When you put that in a graph 4MB or 8MB quickly goes to minutes in propagation time, which translates into multiple % orphan rates.
The only other fact you then need to realise is that a 30% miner doesn't get orphaned 30% of the time while a 1% will only be so lucky 1% of the time. Over time the small miner either goes out of business or maybe merges with one of the bigger miners. Either way: more profits for large miners.
So centralisation pressure. That doesn't stop with 1% miners. Eventually, with only 2 miners left, a 40% miner will have a lot harder time to stay in business than the 60% one.
That last scenario might be a bit extreme in practice but even if only everything below 10% or 5% gets killed, that's already very bad.
I'll try to find the link to that report.

That has nothing to do with the topic at hand (Signature Aggregation) other than having a title that sounds like it might apply here.
BIP131 is about referencing many inputs with the same scriptPubKey in a wildcard fashion, instead of enumerating all inputs specifically. BIP131 is bad because it incentivices key re-use.
I don't think a combination of these two is possible.

Not really, as the sudden jump to 2.1+MB could cause a shock in the fee market where it takes a while to find a new equilibrium and in the meantime wallets start estimating wrong fees and spammers can run attacks cheaply again.
Smooth uptake in SegWit usage and thus smooth (demand driven) growth of the block size is actually a great feature, even if accidental.

I've always wondered what the best/fairest way would be.
Starting anew might be very difficult. Bitcoin probably had the one and only chance at a reasonably fair distribution.
Resuming from a snapshot of Bitcoin solves that, but has many downsides too.
A one or two-way peg (optionally for a limited time only) to the new coin sounds like a nice middle ground.

That's validationless mining for you. And it has more disadvantages than just empty blocks because it's basically *helping* an attacker by lengthening his chain. So it's extremely bad for security as a whole.

Bull shit. They are Bitcoin Transactions. Every single one of them is valid by all rules and can be send to a miner and will get mined.
They are Bitcoin transactions but the good thing about them is that they don't all get sent to the whole world and the miners, nor that people need to wait for confirmations to further spend the money.

"Safe" means upholding the core design requirements? Would that make sense?
For an aircraft one of the design requirements would be to keep the occupants alive. Otherwise you might as well take a shortcut and strap some people to an artillery shell.
"Safe" also means having a safety margin, the size of which depends on the value of the system (platform+contents) under consideration. If imagine drones having lower safety margins than a 747.
Safe also depends on context: no 747 will survive a direct missile hit. But military aircraft will have warning systems, counter measures, stealth and extra protection.
Bitcoin is a brittle system under active development flying through hostile airspace. Steering errors will cause a crash, shifting the load too much as to cause imbalance will cause a crash. Overloading past capacity will cause a crash.
And the most important design requirement that limits changes to all those problems is decentralisation. We want to take on board anything imaginable and take it anywhere around the world.
As soon as we get limited down to only 4 possible landing sites and restricted to only 1st world rich people that hand over passports and buy non-fungible tickets, then we've become Concorde.


Are different independent forms of (de)centralisation.
Dev: started out with 1 (100% centralised) and grew over time. The centralisation pressure there is that the required qualifications to be a good dev have risen quite a lot (for example Gavin and Mike no longer apply). But luckily the world population is large enough to contain many more that do apply, so we're in the dozens now and still growing. Decentralisation features are being continuously built as well to help that process: meta: documentation, accessibility to peer review as well as non-meta in the code itself: versionbits allows different features from different projects to be underway at the same time without interference. Libconsensus separates hairy difficult critical code from all the rest where multiple competing or cooperating people can hack away at their own pace.
Users. The more and more diverse the better, but use cases that really turn out not to fit will just due off without affecting other use cases. Worst case is "only one use case". Not really centralised i guess.
Mining. Is currently the important one. Started out high, became pretty decentralised but then became more centralised again. There are some pressures that push towards centralisation: orphan rate and economies of scale. Slight changes (block size) might make those spiral out of control. Most people are convinced as such by the data.

But by the time a miner starts focusing on version 3 blocks he knows at least 80% of the network will understand him and be on his side. He'll be at the right side of the hard fork.
I'd expect a miner to create a large version 3 block as soon as possible as to trigger such a hardfork, thereby knocking off up to 20% of the network (the slowpokes) and decreasing the difficulty and earn a bit more blockreward.
@_date: 2016-03-08 14:46:09
Exactly. Why does not work for example on combining the signatures of all inputs into one. As recently proposed by Greg:   Saving 20% to 40% transaction size and allowing for trustless, easy and incentiviced coinjoining. Not enough glory? Not true scaling? Not super-beneficial side effects?
1.8MB SW next month and 20% to 40% true scaling in 6 months? More and faster gain than pushing a contentious hard fork today.

@_date: 2016-01-17 20:36:20
Oh wow 2 days ago a few constants were changed. Yeah that completely undermines my argument.
Yeah i realise classic is proposing a simple patch that will break consensus leading to two chains growing apart NEVER to come back together. Thus a hostile contentious split in community as well as money.
That's outright war that will destroy a lot of value for everyone immediately and will undermine any potential future trust outsiders might have in bitcoin for decades to come. What idiot would invest money in a system that is ruled by mob law and can change direction completely on the whim of some populist du jour?

It's not a fixed date, but stuff like the above is in there. Further many core devs have said as much as well as signed the roundtable document that even puts a date on it.


You don't know that. There's no experience. Many people (i.e. all core devs) don't think so our at the very least aren't sure enough to risk everything. Besides they don't want to set a precedent where a minor majority can fuck over a huge share of the community. You may be 75% now, but one in 4 times you will be in the 25% and it's your turn to get fucked. That doesn't sound like something stable like digital gold.


People will certainly lose money. Everyone, both the 25% and 75%. Chaos and infighting are a big warning sign for (potential) investors to steer clear.
And it's also not so certain it will be the 25% that will lose out.

EVERYONE in the whole world needs to update within 2 months? Bitcoin will be dead and ClassicCoin will be the new one, within two months?!
Oh and just to make sure it's not contentious enough, they're talking about making the threshold 60%, not 75% like crazy-XT and certainly not like around 95% like normal people think about when talking about hard forks.

The fact that core (the yp supersmart people that have built bitcoin as it is today through hard work and decades of experience) has to say things are difficult and something everyone wants, including them, is impossible right now.
While the other side promises golden rainbows. But can't put two coherent sentences together that accurately portray how bitcoin actually works (that's a bit harder to judge without some indepth knowledge of your own).

I still disagree for the same reason. And although it might be an appeal to authority, i don't think you'll find many (if any) core devs that would be comfortable with anything less than 90% or 95%. Especially without any experience in HF and on such tough issues. It might be different for a HF that merely solves some small inefficiencies and does some code cleanup

Yeah most people initially confuse (and disregard) it as an altcoin, and besides anyone claiming "truth" are highly suspicious for sure. But the situation is a bit different here. Truthcoin originally was an idea for a prediction market (i.e. letting a market determine "truth") which was not supposed to be an altcoin but a sidechain.
Unfortunately the inventor ( ) has had some setbacks with various teams trying to implement a bastardized ripoff version (like Augur), wasting his time and poisoning the well. I do have high hopes of his Prediction Market one day seeing the light of day (bitcoinhivemind is the renamed thing, to avoid the altcoin confusion).

After a contentious HF it's not a matter of longest chain anymore: there are 2 independent longest chains. 2 currencies. With all the chaos that that brings for exchanges and merchants and owners. Plummeting prices for both chains. Scams and double spend left and right.

Yup you're right. BU is just the smoke and mirrors the politicians can point to, to pretend there's some activity. While the experienced scammers try to wiggle themselves into a spot of power.
BU will go the way of classic and XT, for sure. The foot soldiers will end up backstabbed with the garbage. But, just like in millennia of history being repeated the farao's, emperors, kings and dictators will keep pulling the strings or be replaced by the next. Bitcoin has a chance of being different and becoming a tool not for politicians and scammers only, but for everybody equally. However, all it takes is one screwup, giving in to politics, and I believe it might all be over and there might not be another chance for decades.

Not true in the case of SegWit. Old miners can just keep mining non-SegWit blocks and they'll be fine. They'd be did for missing out extra fees, but nothing bad will happen to them.

You are about to destroy Bitcoin by claiming to be able to single handedly run the whole forked community with the experience of contributing exactly NOTHING to the Bitcoin project. You have never shown to understand consensus code at all, quite the opposite actually. You are deliberately undercutting Core's timelines just to get your own shit through. Using a highly contentious hard fork no less. In one and a half months with currently not a line of code written.
And for what?
For a 0.25MB extra size?
Even if the risk is small. You cannot deny that a hard fork is a risk. And you risk ruining everything for 0.25MB of block size.
@_date: 2016-03-22 10:02:11
Core (you can't really talk about them like a single entity, but what the heck) has always said increase in due time. When enough data shows that all the performance enhancements done over the years are sufficient to make it safe.
At least halfway 2015 (probably earlier) there was some talk of preparing some sort of hard fork in core too. Especially since hard forks take time, they'd have to be planned ahead. In the meantime it was clear that blocks weren't full at any stretch, nor would a "fee event" destroy everything (not sure which dumbass came up with that doom story, probably Gavin) as was nicely proven by the "stress tests" during September (and again last month).
Things went even quicker when the SF variant of SegWit was discovered (not thanks to classic mind you).
Dev decentralization is actually doing really well. It started out 100% centralized (Satoshi) but has been improving year after year. And that trend is still continuing, so I don't worry about that. It would be nice to see some Chinese devs (or from other "non-western" countries). Just for diversity sake. But I guess there are a few human barriers like language that make that a bit harder than ideal. It will come.
I don't know at which point you will stop calling it "one team" and therefore centralized, but I've passed that point long ago.
Miner centralization is a separate thing and a whole different story. And that's where my cares are.
"none of your claims and points" was referring to your last post and maybe whatever I had in memory from other posts. But my memory is pretty crap, so it couldn't have been much more.

That's not true at all. It's about the economic majority. Full nodes and exchanges and merchants have a say in it too.
And even then: it's still very bad if that majority is anything significantly lower than 100%. Bitcoin is supposed to be as stable and trustworthy as gold. A change in the rules is a very bad precedent.
@_date: 2016-01-17 05:50:52
It is.
But we can't replace experts with years of experience, some of them even decades before Bitcoin existed, with some newbies that haven't produced a single commit yet.
With that in mind, you must agree that breaking consensus and going into a full out hard fork war, while the difference between 1.75MB from Core and 2MB by classic is only 0.25MB, would be ridiculous?
@_date: 2016-01-10 07:15:04
The ONE thing I was so afraid of getting into Bitcoin: an open source project with money at stake, that's going to amplify the normal open source project infighting and bikeshedding. But I didn't expect it this soon and I didn't really realise it was this bad until quite late.

It is THE problem. It's not seconds. It can easily go to minutes. And in this sort of game average didn't mean anything, worst case (adversarial case!) is what counts. Big miners can easily kill off small miners by giving them 10% or more orphan rate. That's what centralisation means.
The only thing that saved it up until recently was Matt's (core dev) relay network, which is a centralized system that was supposed to be temporary until real fixes were done. Unfortunately it caused everyone to become blind to the problem and noone really worked on solutions much. Except core, but it's hard and a lot of work. 
So because of Matt's hard work in trying to keep Bitcoin afloat, the classic devs are now running around that there's no problem at all and promising people things that are not possible. Instead of joining a perfectly fine running team of expert devs they vilify them, go around telling shit about them and claiming they can do better. And people are falling for it despite them having 0 track record.
Anyway. It doesn't really matter whether core is right or not, core has an increase to 1.75MB in the pipe line. So the increase comes either way.
The only thing that matters is that a contentious hard fork is going to destroy bitcoin.
25% of the community is going to get fucked over. That is a very bad precedent and anyone with half a brain should know that next time they will be on the minority side. Bitcoin was supposed to be solid as digital gold, yet its rules get changed at the whim of some populist snake oil salesmen. Nice solid store of value that is.
And for what? For 250 kilobytes!
For 250 kilobytes the one and only group of people in the entire world with enough experience and skills will be kicked in the balls and sent off. What's left is a burnt out gavin, jeff and  jtoomim with 0 contributions to bitcoin as main dev. All 3 of which have on multiple occasions been shown wrong in their understanding of consensus game theory.
And even if they are capable they can't replace 30 experienced devs.
Oh you want proof that there is a problem? Think about it: until very recently they were screaming unlimited is fine, there is no problem. 20 GB is fine, there is no problem. 20 MB. 8 MB. 2-4-8 MB.
Now they realise that yes actually there is a problem but because core has already committed to 1.75MB (yes core was first!), let's just outdo and undercut them really quickly with an incompatible competing 2MB... Roll out an untested highly contentious hard fotk in 6 weeks. How is that for a disingenuous hostile takeover?

I agree mining centralization is scarier, I was just comparing the two to indicate that this is also very bad.
The problem is that other people (apparently) store millions of coins in centralized places and if those coins get stolen (a la MtGox or by governments) and get dumped then you can bet the price will tank for at least a while.

Aside from pointless, agreed.


Well, that's why I mentioned that there are _still_ many people that don't understand that and that they are now using that misinformation to spread FUD about RBF.




Hidden agenda or simply reality? I'm not sure. I'm all for keeping 0conf working as best it can, but if it hinders true progress then the blockchain is about confirmations, so that should take priority.
To his credit, I've seen PT talk about how dangerous 0conf is for almost 2 years. RBF was already in the picture too then, so at least he's been consistent about it.

That fixed thing was already the promise on the website originally, but then they suddenly started including doublings in it again. So now it's back to fixed again? Flip flop much?
So this thing is already set for March 1, but they don't even know what it's gonna be yet. Yeah I feel real confident that my money is in safe hands now. I'm sure the whole world will think "Wow this dev team is so solid, and look at their immense experience, wow! Let's invest in bitcoin!". NOT

I'm on phone right now so can't look it up. If your open minded is shouldn't be very hard to find though.
One way you can intuitively get a feel for it is if you think about the huge improvements in efficiency that have been made the last few years. Yet when you start your full node is still takes quite some time to sync up. For me it seems it got faster about a year ago, but then it started to get slower again.
This indicates quite nicely how we're balancing around a point where code improvements are on the same order as the blocks are growing in size. Grow faster and it will quickly overwhelm any cide imprudent can offset. Remember that many scaling factors are not linear and can grow out of hand very quickly.
Of course a full node catching up is different from miners and others trying to follow the tip of the chain with the lowest latency possible, but there is overlap there.
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:04:55
Of course it's not 100%, noone ever claimed that. It almost can't be if the receiver is not completely stupid and you don't have all the miners in your pocket.
But 100% is not really the goal here and even 1% is be profitable.

@_date: 2016-03-23 23:49:04
No that's just a classic falsehood to try to make it all sound flowerpowery.
Mining is the process of ordering valid transactions into blocks.
That's all. "Ordering" is the important verb here. Blocks are a practical optimisation: you don't want to order individual transactions, you take many thousands at once and call it a block.
With quite a bit of stretching you could call it: mining is voting on the order of valid transactions into blocks.
That's as close as you can stretch it to voting and democracy and all that.
Note that what's being decided (or voted on) is "the order". Givens are that the transactions must be valid and they must be packaged into valid blocks in the process.
If there is a dispute the rule is that the length (total amount of work) of VALID chains is the tie breaker.
That is nakamoto consensus: consensus on the order of valid transactions. That's all it means.
So what happens if a transaction or a block is not valid? It doesn't exist and is therefore completely ignored in the above process.
And who decides what "valid" means? Well that's hardcoded and has been mostly decided by Satoshi plus some soft forks by other devs that made some previously valid but meaningless transactions either invalid or meaningful (in a whole new way). What is the process of changing those rules? Well that has nothing to do with any of the above per se. Not with the miners, not with the voting that miners do.
And if you want to claim that miners or users can vote with their feet by switching to another coin or fork, then sure they could. Just like people buy different brands of cars and can change to another brand if they don't like one anymore. That's free choice and free market and voting with your wallet or feet or whatever you want to call it. But people have been doing that for millennia and that sure as hell is not nakamotoconsensus or in whatever way a new invention.
@_date: 2016-03-19 00:19:37

That's not really how mathematics works and u was using mathematics in the broad same to include game theory and computer science. In a real life system there you have to look at tend and correlations and look for evidence of causations and theoretical modeling. That there is.
Core is also going to increase to 1.75 MB, so there's absolutely nothing magic about 1MB.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:15:51


And the Blockchain + Proof of Work was invented to make it so.
If you don't use the blockchain, which you don't if you do 0conf, then the above statement doesn't hold.
Also: RBF breaks nothing that wasn't already broken, saying otherwise is FUD. And this implementation of RBF is opt-in, so people have a choice. And RBF actually solves a problem that people have a lot: stuck transactions. Stuck transactions do not make for a good first impression for people new to Bitcoin.

* Besides correct reply.
* I was replying to YOU saying 20MB, so I don't know why you think saying 2MB is going to make my point invalid. 
* Apparently some pools can't even handle 1MB since they're mining 10% empty blocks.
* 20MB definitely is way too much (see your own data) and 2MB and 20MB are on the same trend, so it's highly questionable whether the effect for 2MB really is insignificant. Definitely something to not handwave away. Either way, 1.8MB is coming up, so we can stop the bs and just focus on making that work as best as possible.
P.S. I'm terribly confused, the level of dumb things you're saying lately is getting simpler and simpler to poke holes through, yet no one seems to be replying anymore. Did you announce somewhere where I missed it: "Haaahaha fooled you! April Fools for a whole year! Peter and Greg and me are actually the best buddies and we concocted this drama just to test how well Bitcoin would withstand political attack! We had a few very close calls, but all in all we decided that Bitcoin passed. I'm back to being lead dev and we're now full steam ahead on SW and CT and the signature aggregation thing."

Straw man. I can demoninate my ass in Bitcoin, doesn't have to do with anything.
Of course there are differences. One is that you don't need to wait for confirmations and another is that you can do true microtransactions that only idiots expected to be able to do on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-03-03 01:18:05
I'd describe myself the same: dev but not bitcoin dev and know a shitload about how bitcoin works.
I'm certainly not taking devs words for granted without at least following their logic and looking at counter arguments from others.
Certainly individual devs can make mistakes. Or maybe their argument is correct but they're overlooking out underestimating a different dynamic that has an overruling opposite effect. As a whole i don't think i could point out a single real accountable mistake by them.
Also I think you're underestimating how much experience they actually have in this field. Some of them have been in this and very related fields for decades. Long before Bitcoin even existed.
Of course that's not too say they know everything and have all the answers ready, but I'm pretty sure there is simply no one outside Core that has that much experience and the right smartness. Not an individual person let alone a whole team, which would be necessary to "replace Core" as some people want.
One last thing: I think economics is actually quite overstated (by a lot of people, but you mention it too) as a required expertise. Most of that in Bitcoin is actually mathematics with game theory and logic. Economics happens to partly overlap there so you could quibble over the word. The invention here is a trustless permissionless decentralized p2p payment system: the last 2 words describe something quant and common, the other words are what make it stand out as revolutionary, first-in-history and a new frontier in science.

There's nothing word games about it. That's the fundamental protection that is in Bitcoin. Even in the white paper. Only valid blocks get accepted. Valid means according to the rules laid out by satoshi. If you want to change those rules you have to move heaven and earth.

Actually it is. It's a challenge to build it properly and efficiently and scalable, but it doesn't require non-existing technology.


Nope. It's pretty simple: cooperate or you're guaranteed to lose more than you were even trying to steal. Bitcoin has complex game theory, LN not so much.


Not always on and not really hot wallet. You can outsource the always-on part (which is actually check a few times per day, not always on). Either outsource it to a third party or to a Rapberry Pi in your moms basement. Or to the full node you're running at home (nice incentive for more full nodes).
And it's not really a hot wallet as the money can not be stolen, only transferred to the presigned addresses.

Hey man, I think it's awesome that you're thinking about coding on bitcoin and making patches and helping out. That's what everyone wants: the more devs the better. I'm definitely not trolling you or preventing you from doing so. I'm just trying to take away misunderstandings.
Misunderstandings by me where i don't fully understand your point. And misunderstandings that you may have about segwit. Both misunderstandings mixed together makes it a bit confusing, but i think we're making progress.
I agree that it sounds like there's some bytes being used there, but from what i read elsewhere i don't think it's much or possibly nothing. What might be confusing is that there are some things done temporarily in memory but not really stored as such in the final transaction.
Disclaimer: i am a developer but not a bitcoin developer and am not familiar with the bitcoin source code. My information comes from talks, blogs and forum posts by the relevant people.
Here's another view on what's happening: 
Also remember that segwit exists since july 2015 or so in the Elements Alpha sidechain. There it was implemented in a "clean" way without soft fork overhead. 
I absolutely agree that any space purely used to make this a SF instead of a HF is a waste and that could in the future be fixed in a HF and like you said, it sounds like they're working on that (together with some other code cleanups, I think there's actually a BIP to list all those cleanups). I'm sure help is always welcome.
However from what I've seen so far that waste is actually pretty low (or zero). I fully agree with your last paragraph.
Personally to me this one sounds like an awesome follow up to segwit: 40% smaller transactions and privacy and fungibility improvements.

Mike Hearn has actually been quite irrelevant and hasn't been active for Bitcoin for quite some time now.
Regarding the rest of your post:
Scientific experts lay a foundation of facts and truth, built by logic. Of all people, you as a politician, know how important it is to listen to the advice of experts in the field. There are none better or more qualified than the current Core team.
The social problem you talk about is that people refuse to accept the facts and are turning to quacks that promise them what they want to hear. In that regard the problem is not technical indeed. In fact the technical solution has already been put into motion long ago.
The facts say that any hard fork is very ill advised right now. Splintering a project is always dangerous, but even more so if the project is "money". Money is nothing but "trust: trust that all is well today and trust that it will be tomorrow". War (a hard fork) is definitely not good for "money".
So, you think there is a social problem and the geeks only look at the facts, which clearly don't convince everyone. Could you please try to see if you can be a solution to this social problem? You probably won't be able to convince them that the experts are right, maybe better not even try. But tell them not to go to war, for a victory cannot be had. Not even by winning.
Core is working hard on readying Bitcoin for true democracy. A situation where literally everyone can create any feature they wish and then convince others to join her. Without having to wait for consensus (so innovation can be very quick) and without having to start a war. Because those features can coexist peacefully beside each other. Good features will grow in popularity, bad feature will simply not get used much and eventually die off. People get to vote by simply using the features they like.
Improvements and features (most already in the works even before the block size debate started) that will enable democracy:
- Side chains to allow experimentation and rapic innovation without risking Bitcoin.
- Version bits will allow multiple soft forks to happen at the same time. Features don't need to wait months before being rolled out, or get delayed because the previous feature is progressing too slow.
- Refactoring the code, not only to make it cleaner and easier to understand, but also to separate the really difficult consensus part into the libconsensus library. This will allow for completely new Bitcoin implementations that are still compatible with Bitcoin.
- Core has come up with methods of doing almost any conceivable new feature as a soft fork. So there will be no limits to what eager developers and inventors could come up with.
- Better documentation every day, to make it easier for new developers to come in.
- many more
I am convinced we can have the first parts of true and peaceful democracy within Bitcoin within a year or so. The immediate block size problem will already have been fixed by Core within a few months, so there's plenty of time for a democracy to spawn.
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:18:01
Agree with almost everything you say. You're doing a great job explaining stuff. Just a slight thingy:




hmm.. yeah... but it's not that hard to get block propagated. Make more connections, run some more nodes yourself, through FIBRE. If it were just about propagation they'd not care much about your node or even about a big majority of all nodes. They can route around all that.
What's more important is that nodes are run by the bakery around the corner where the miner wants to buy his bread. If he doesn't give the baker a valid block, his family will be starving.
So, more like:
I'm basically a participant on the network who says "you must follow the rules set within 0.13.2 or I will not accept your bitcoins and you won't get my goods or services or Dollars". Again, they couldn't care less about you as an individual, but now suddenly the majority does emerge as important. And because of the way money works (you can accept it today trusting that tomorrow someone else will accept it from you) every single individual is proportionally important.
Anyway... carry on, please.

Again time dimension fail: who the fuck cares whether it's 1.8MB from day one or 1.4MB on day one and 100K more every month?


Nonsense and lie, coming from classic camp. You're believing the wrong people.


SW is yeah.


So do Core devs. Both are on the road map. Again you don't understand the time dimension: both today is nonsense, it doesn't matter if one arrives a little later as long as we have enough wiggle room in the meantime. Which SW gives plenty.


All very unlikely pessimistic estimates, but luckily we have the 1.8MB and later doubling coming up, so we don't need to give a shit whether LN succeeds or not. Not for another few years.


Pissed off at trolls spreading the same debunked FUD again and again.


All nonsense. And again it's not black/white all or nothing. And time is also a dimension: few at first, more lateron.






Oh that angle again? Blockstream has grown to roughly 25% of the Core devs. But even before Blockstream existed the same people were already building Bitcoin. Core (including Blockstream) have built pretty much every fucking thing about Bitcoin that exists today.


Not true. People have given up their jobs and dedicated their lives to Bitcoin very early on.


Again the time dimension. No of course not overnight. Have you not found the quote where Rusty Russel says he'll trust it with only very tiny amounts at first?
LN is a simple caching layer on top of Bitcoin. LN IS Bitcoin. The sort of trust needed to use it are completely different than trusting Bitcoin. Trusting Bitcoin requires trusting these virtual imaginary nerd tokens. Trusting LN is akin to trusting your wallet software to not have bugs or vulnerabilities that lose those tokens or get them stolen.

Lie. That's putting words into Satoshi's mouth. And even if it wasn't, there is research and emperical data that shows that larger blocks are deadly. Including the improvements of SegWit, that is the largest we can go for now.


Because no viable such system has been invented yet. But if you have a credible researcher that is willing to invent one and publish peer reviewed papers about it or a decent BIP with some proof of concept, then I'm sure core would happily accept it. Hint: it might be outright impossible.

There is no such thing as "into and out of the blockchain"! Maybe you can count mining as a way of getting more bitcoins into the chain and sending it to a burn address as out of. But that's stretching it already. And certainly doesn't have anything to do with velocity.
Oh you mean exchanging bitcoins for something else of value? Well that's what LN is about: buying shit! Even more than Bitcoin itself, especially as Bitcoin becomes more of a settlement network. And even there: one person getting out of bitcoin is another going in: still no coins are going into our out of the blockchain.
Oooh you mean exchanging for USD? You mean parking your bitcoins at an exchange: still on blockchain, just not your posession anymore. In short: a lot of coins sitting idly in cold storage. Is that what you call velocity?
Oooooh you mean the actual exchanging for USD? Where you buy and sell IOUs every minute? What does that have to do with Bitcoin exsctly? Or the chain?
Please educate yourself on velocity of money and make up your mind which context you're talking about.

He's not in any position to demand concessions. The fact that he's even thinking about it is already anti-bitcoin and literally hurting Bitcoin and himself.

I was just assuming that the 1MB SegWit would need a soft fork to reduce the base size, but I guess it could still allow 1MB non-SegWit blocks to stay compatible with old mining nodes and also only allow 1MB SegWit blocks. But then there's not much incentive for miners to mine SegWit blocks, as they don't get any more fee.

The moment one big block is made public, the network will split into two distinct networks, two distinct blockchains, two distinct currencies, two distinct prices, two distinct coins (although initially still entangled!).
People not owning their coins (having them on an exchange for example) or not correctly untangling them into two separate coins stand to lose (or get scammed out of) one side of their coins quickly.
Also SPV wallets are highly at risk from all kinds of scams.
I bet a lot of people will simply give up on Bitcoin: if a mob of ignoramas can cause this much damage to the system, what Bitcoin worth anyway? And a lot of people will try to dump the classic coin if they only want to hold on to the real coins. So both prices will tank quickly causing panic there too.
And all that thanks to some noobs that don't understand the first thing about Bitcoin didn't have the patience to wait one more month for a much better and safer solution to be rolled out.
That's IF it happens, of course. So far it looks like rational people are still in the majority and the whole classic thing will blow over just like XT and Unlimited before it.

Nice avoidance of the point.
There is one overruling feature that all bitcoin customers want: decentralisation. If you don't want that you can go get a PayPal account.
BTW: Amazing how you've had your head under a rock in those 37 years and don't know the first thing about open source. You must have been working for MS.
PS why don't you give open source a try by jumping on a project like IBLT or Lightning Network or Aggregated Signatures (almost halves transaction size, i.e. doubling capacity, while greatly improving privacy and fungibility). Be an open source hero instead of wasting your time complaining on refit.
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:52:27
Dude. It's open source and decentralized. There is no such thing as a business plan or fixed road map or a manager deciding what goes and what doesn't.
The fact is there is talk of a future size increase in the roadmap and its FAQ. And many core devs have promised to work on a hf proposal the coming months in the roundtable thing.
That's already more than you can ask for in a project like this. If other core devs have good arguments not to do it or if devs that made the promise change their mind based on solid reasons then you're just shit out of luck.
The only way you get to get more influence is but doing the work yourself (or posting someone to do it) and even then you run the risk that others will have good reason to slow you down or block you. Tough shit.
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:25:02
No, this is not simple conventional redundancy logic. A consensus system is special. You can't continue growing chains if there's no consensus. Complete down time when a bug hits is preferable to different implementations going of in different directions.
Blocks are the beats of the clock in the bitcoin universe. Freezing that clock (in order to fix a problem) sucks but is a lot less of a problem than the universe splitting in two, each with their own clock.
In any conventional system an incompatibility is a problem for individuals. In a consensus system it's all or nothing, for everybody as a whole. Either there's consensus or there's not. Half-consensus is useless and extremely dangerous. Two half-consensus chains are irreconcilable without at least one side losing money. Consensus by definition means every participant (minus an odd individual). Consensus is the product of the consensus system. By definition there can only be one such system (of a certain set of consensus rules). One system means all participants are exactly 100% identical, so there's no point in making an alternative implementation because it must be exactly equal anyway.
Having different versions of the reference client is already a risk there. But sort of a necessary small evil if we want bitcoin to innovate. And since it's an evolutionary progress guarded by many man hours of peer review and testing as well as an extreme degree of coverage by unit tests. It seems to have been an acceptable risk so far. At some point that evolution night come to a crawl and bitcoin will be completely cemented.


Correct. As is almost everything. That's why it's important for people to realise these things and make a wise decision on how they hold and protect their money. You can't enforce people to run a full node either. Or to not sure their coins on MtGox. 
It's a shame for individuals to have to learn the lesson by first losing their money, but it also damages bitcoin as a whole if a large group makes the wrong choices. MtGox depressed the Bitcoin price for quite a while. An accidental fork due to a bug in an alternative client means a partitioning. With all kinds of attacks and double spends on both sides. Certainly causing a loss of faith in bitcoin.
Anyway this is all only regarding the consensus part, which is in the (slow, difficult) process of being split off into a libconsensus library, free for alternative wallet/node implementations to start using. That's perfectly fine.
@_date: 2017-02-01 08:25:07
It wasn't just orphaned. It was invalid. And not just invalid in the sense of accidental misconfiguration of a single miner as we've had many times before: quite a few miners went along with this block. A fork for 24 minutes.
Not just Ver lost money, other miners also wasted their time for 24 minutes.
It was similar to the BIP66 episode, just smaller in scale as at least some miners learnt their lesson back then and because the hashing power of the dummies was smaller this time.
Those are the facts. Saying this was just another orphan is an attempt at whitewashing. And you know it.
Not that i care about any of these miners. All their own stupid fault. I wish it had been 24 hours instead of minutes. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 12:49:14
Notice how every time one attack (XT, unlimited, classic) appears to have been averted the price goes up but then every time when it resurfaces its ugly uncertainty inducing head, the price goes back down again.

Economic arguments merely spur the wishful thinking.
No they didn't know 1MB was perfect, it wasn't perfect in fact it was waay too large still. But luckily blocks weren't full yet and they had time to do a shitload of hard work to improve Bitcoin technologically and they now believe that together with some future enhancements (some of which SW enables) they can now safely go to 1.75MB.

Any change has that property. Soft or hard or sideways fork. At least with SW old nodes can validate enough to stay safe and they still validate the most important properties of Bitcoin like the inflation rate and doublespending.
There's a nice gentle incentive for them to upgrade, but even if they won't or can't they still get lower fees.

Have you given up your job yet to work, without any pay, more than fulltime on Bitcoin contributions, for the last 4 years?

@_date: 2016-01-29 01:26:01
Yeah i was on this train of thought recently too. I say after this crap is over (or even before) SPV wallets should be protected against this kind of attack too. They need to validate a lot more and at the very least warn the user. I understand some things have been proposed over the years but Hearn was always blocking those improvements.
Anyway SW and pruning and fraud proofs open the way to have not just black or white (full node or spv) but also gray: light nodes that have practically the same level of security as a full node yet at near SPV like bandwidth use. That looks like a bright future.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:16:04


How come you have such trust in ignorant sheep but not in experts that have proven track records that they know what they are talking about?


Now you are just being an asshole. Do you seriously think the block size is the only thing that has happened in the past years? Are you really that blind? The fact that Bitcoin can barely run with 1MB right now is completely 100% thanks to the improvements Core has made!


Oh geez.. months eh? Yeah we can't ignore wishful thinking for months now can we. Step aside mathematics! Wishful thinking idiots want the impossible so we can't let them wait.
What is that? Experts came up with an actual solution? No too late... we're going to destroy Bitcoin with a hard fork now because we had to wait for our pony for more than a month. And we're kicking out the only developers in the world that can do this work. Doesn't matter, we'll make up some FUD to justify it.


Why would they keep working for free for assholes that don't listen to reason anyway. Certainly not for a few coins they have stashed... the can just dump those.

You don't do anything smart like a rolling update with the option to rollback in case of emergency and with as much backwards compatibility as possible?


Different Core people have differing opinions on how bad or dangerous HF's are. A lot depends on what the HF does of course.
Where the opinions do NOT differ are on contentious-HF's. Those are all around bad and dangerous. No one with a brain argues in favor of a contentious HF.
User bases are quite relative in open source to begin with, it's not like anyone is a paying customer. If they want something, they can go pay for the development of it themselves.

One fun fact:


Minutes after one Zander loudly claimed Classic was not affected: 
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:10:02
The function of running a full node is to protect oneself and by extension the network from attacks. Classic nodes don't do that, as once the attack starts they will side with the attacker. Luckily at that moment they will get automatically banned, so it will cease to be an issue for my full node.
It is still unfortunate for SPV users however, as they risk connecting to the attacker chain and thereby getting fucked. And thanks to the current Sybil attack that chance is actually quite high.
No I would not consider a wolf in sheep clothes a functional node, if the only function of such node is protect you from wolves.

That's a very dumb and dangerous thing to say. you are falling for their word games and empty promises.
The only voting going on in the design of Bitcoin is voting for the next block! That comes down to voting for the order of transactions. That's it.
One other design goal of Bitcoin is stable (ideally FIXED) rules of the game. Like the 21M. Stability is required for trust (not talking about price stability). Now Satoshi didn't leave us with a completely finished piece of software, so it makes sense that updates are necessary.
Someone who has no idea about how the system works at a very deep level has NO business deciding anything. They can "trust, but verify" from the sideline, but it's bonkers to give them a say in anything. You don't give passengers a say in how to engineer an aircraft. They may express wishes like "smoother, faster, more comfortable" but that's it. They don't get to chose what type of glue is used or the shape of the wings. Fk off with that nonsense.
True democracy will come with the upcoming versionbits and sidechains improvements (amongst others). Then it will be possible for any dev team to create their own features and deploy them. THEN users can "vote" for the features by simply using them (or not). That's the way we can get massive parallel development.
Now you can say everyone is free to make a fork and try to get everyone behind him. Yes, that's true... fork away. But people need to realize that when that succeeds, everything is over. Bitcoin is worth nothing if it can be forked.
The only good outcome is when classic crashes and burns extremely hard, the earlier the better. Then it would be a great warning for future quacks that claim single handedly do what a 60-man well oiled dev-team full of experts with decades of experience can do. That would show the world that yes, Bitcoin will survive infighting and yes the rules of the game are set in stone, your investment is safe with Bitcoin.

UASF doesn't remove any miner from equation. Even in normal SegWit 5%of the miners can keep running the old version and not be removed. UASF increases that 5% to whatever. They can ask still mine just fine. Without upgrading.
(Not that i made up my mind yet btw. Haven't investigated UASF yet to know whether it's a good idea.

You're hinting at the classic bullshit, which is exactly the the false solution I was talking about: they claim "free market" but are doing power grabs and incompatible buggy development that will split and ruin everything for everybody.
BIP9 and other improvements that Core has made and is still working on are the right direction for a working free market. Developers choose what to work on and users choose what features they want, but the shit remains robust, compatible and peer-reviewed. No need for power grabs and political campaigns demonizing the other devs.

Version number and such are not a waste (that's the word, not waist) at all. It's allows for easy future upgradability of the script language and the cryptography. There are plans for example to implement Schnorr signature (smaller, more modern) that can then lead to Aggregated Signature (basically summing 10 signature into the space of 1) leading to 40% smaller transactions as well as a huge improvement in privacy and fungibility.
As far as I know there's actually no waste caused by segwit other than something like 33 bytes in the block header. You couldn't seriously complain about that.
The roadmap (and FAQ) does talk of future block size increases. The roundtable thing is even more explicit, but it's not signed by ALL core devs, only the ones present plus many that agreed afterwards (no, not all).

Well it is suggested development and nobody has the power to just put anything into bitcoin. But assuming no bugs and issues and assuming consensus, then pretty soon after SegWit. It almost made it into SegWit itself. And if not then Schnorr will have an even bigger impact on transactions size and then Signature Aggregation and MAST.
Also SegWit itself already offsets this 2 or 3 bytes transaction size increase with a doubling of the block size. And if any p2p compression technique were to be built (which doesn't require global consensus) those 2 or 3 bytes would disappear as only one bit of those bytes is actually significant.

And there are probably a few altcoin devs that are honestly trying and do stand a chance of creating some interesting testbed for something innovative (indebted by them out more likely indebted by core devs years ago but so far impossible or too risky to do straight in bitcoin. Once it has been implemented and tested and proven outside bitcoin, it can then easily be integrated into bitcoin. Any honest dev would be glad with that.

That's quite easy actually: because every single person in this space wishes larger blocks.
The fact that there are people that go against their own wish and say: "sorry but not yet possible." That should have you thinking really hard: maybe they are not taking the easy route because they know something. Maybe they are being realistic.
If you really want to talk puppets, then it's obviously clear that Gavin and Jeff are of a whole different calibre than for example Adam and Greg. Not only by the decades of difference in experience in this very space. The problem is that it requires quite a high level of understanding of the intricacies of Bitcoin to recognise that. Gavin and Jeff don't themselves, let alone the poor sheep falling for the classic snake oil salesmen.
I (and everybody) understand the economic argument: more users, higher price, more investments, etc. I started out with that being my only thought as well. But economics doesn't make mathematically impossible things possible. Economics can only come into play once the mathematical foundation is solid. Once that foundation allows for it, then obviously everyone will after the bigger the better. It's not like the economic argument is stupid or flawed. It's that it's not yet relevant because it's being precluded by deeper more fundamental problems. Not unsolvable problems luckily. Which is why were getting 1.75MB soon.

A successful hard fork means everybody (100%) moves over to the new coin. The case i was describing before was just majority, not 100%. That means people are getting screwed over and are staying on the old chain. The new chain is not bitcoin. All the chaos and confusion and loss of money through at least replay attacks but likely other attacks and scams will lead to a lot of people just leaving altogether.
The hard forks done so far in bitcoin are arguably not even hard forks at all as no fork ever happened (no blocks were ever put into the blockchain that would trigger the bugs). This means a very very old version of bitcoin would still validate today's blockchain all the way without problems. Bit of a semantic thing as some devs call it a hard fork and some don't. Either way those were fixes for that would have been catastrophic, so it would have made no sense to be against them. Also those were calmer times and nobody had the evil idea yet of holding improvements hostage for political power gains.

Not anymore thanks to Gavin, that's one of the points of this discussion: validationless mining will lets the whole network assist the attacker in adding more confirmation on top of an invalid block. So 3 confirmations is quite possible even though the attacker only made one invalid block.
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:11:56
No I didn't say that at all. First of all the rules have already changed since Satoshi left, although only in one direction (more strict, i.e. soft fork). Also another such change is now being rolled out: 1.8MB blocks. And as far as I can tell most core devs do see a further Hard Fork happen sometime after that as well.
All I'm saying is that the process of changing the rules is a whole different process than deciding which valid block to pick as the tip of the chain. It is deceiving to simplify it down to "it's all the same voting, it's part of nakamoto consensus, that's how Bitcoin works" or whatever words people that don't understand the details use to deceive others into thinking nothing's wrong.
Luckily changing the rules is not something miners can do on their own for example: all stakeholders have a say in that to some degree. And sure there will be some threshold where some majority could try to force a rule change upon the rest, but that will be at a cost as the jet engine will have to spool down, causing loss of trust/price/value to some degree. Not necessarily fatal, but if avoidable then it's highly preferable to do an uncontentious change.
And since changing the rules like this has never before been tried before, we don't fully know where the thresholds are and what is safe and acceptable and what is an acceptable procedure so that even nay-voters can live with a rule change without stirring up a guerilla war. How much damage a rule change causes is very much a human thing: if noone really cares then even 10% might be enough to change the rules, if 99% care really deeply, then the losing party will surely not be happy. Better to find a compromise that is acceptable to all. Since we're talking about people's money here, I suspect the number will be a lot higher than 10%, I don't know how much lower than 99%.

You know that better than the people that work with this code base daily and actually already implemented the whole thing, including rigorous test cases? Don't you feel like you are shouting at football match on TV from your armchair?


There are VERY good reasons to avoid hard forks. One of which is that Bitcoin is supposed to be as stable and trustworthy as gold. How is anyone ever going to believe it will be stable for hundreds of years if it gets changed around every year at the whim of what some majority of fools wants?
And two because hard fork by definition split the community and split Bitcoin, unless they are 100% uncontentious backed by everyone (not just miners).
And that's exactly what's about to happen is Classic gets it's way and it will be a mess that destroys Bitcoin for years if not completely.
In short: let the people that know what they are doing do their thing. Just keep an eye on them and verify as much as you can. So far, they have done absolutely nothing that shows they're not completely aligned with the success of Bitcoin.

Not true. There are other ways to rebalance channels. Like funding them from another channel or by offering negative fees to incentivize others to send funds in the reverse direction. Or by topping up an existing channel by sending more Bitcoins to it (cheaper than breaking down and restarting a new channel).


In the beginning, sure. Long term, when the system is mature, that's not so obvious at all.


There's a tradeoff/equilibrium. Of course you're not likely to buy an aircraft carrier through LN. So what? It's about the number of transactions and most people will likely have many more small transactions than large transactions.


I don't know who is claiming 99.9999999999999999% (probably nobody) but you are absurd if you think that if it starts out by only handling 50% of all transactions that that wouldn't be a big scaling improvement already.
And actually that whole sentence is dishonest:


You're leaving out the time dimension here. You're making it all or nothing, black or white, now or never. Which is clearly nonsense. First of all it will be definition reduce the need for (on-chain) scaling. But sure, some scaling (on-chain) may still be necessary at some point in time (that's actually what the inventors said even in the initial announcement, disproving even the existence of the notion you claim people have). If that point in time gets postponed by even a year, then that's also a nice gain.

Raspberry pi, I'm not sure it's still good enough. You'll certainly have to do the initial download on a normal pc and then copy the files over to the Pi.
But bitcoind does have two options that will be very helpful in running a full node on a low spec machine:
- blocksonly : downloads only full blocks (not transactions), meaning a lot less bandwidth and cpu cost (Although more spiky every 10 minutes).
- prune : only keep the last x MB of blocks and delete all or ones. So your node only needs a few GB of storage. If you have a large harddisk you don't need this option, but on a flash card you do.
@_date: 2017-02-12 04:38:30


You should also include Signature Aggregation in your list. Which should have a larger impact on transaction size for "normal" transactions than MAST. Although MAST does cut the non-witness data size, which makes it 4x more effective in terms of transactions per block.

Sure, shit needs to be tested and proven. Start small. Still a whole different ballgame then coming home one day and hearing about these virtual internet imaginary nerd tokens that appear out of thin air and you're supposed to pay $400 each for.


The LN wallet (which you turn on when you need to pay) can send value through the LN network. That's as much a hot wallet as your current Android wallet is. And yes you could require a Trezor here. The "always-on" (check a few times per day) part does not need the private key to sign anything. It only needs to send pre-signed transactions when a certain conditioin happens. So no, that's not a hot wallet. And that's also the reason why you could even trust someone else to do that work for you (yes trust, you'd have to trust them to actually check a few times per day and actually send the transactions if necessary). If you don't, you opt for the Raspberry Pi in your moms basement or you let your phone wake up a few times per day to do it all by itself.

Oh that's actually exactly a point I wanted to add but forgot. The more you learn about Bitcoin, the more you know that you don't know everything. Once you get the feeling you understand it all, you know you're not looking hard enough for the next rabbit hole. :)
Another consequence is that you can start disregarding people who pretend to know everything and have easy solutions, cause you know they're full of shit.
I guess that's true generally in life. There's a similar famous quote on quantum mechanics, for example.

That can be easily soft forked in if necessary later. For now this simplifies the code and transaction selection: only one limit to worry about (knapsack problem).
Also the idea is that the witness data is much less critical to the scaling bottleneck. It's data that can be easily pruned and doesn't need to be distributed to all nodes.
¼ naturally falls out of the equation when looking at the optimal and it perfectly balances the cost for creating a UTXO with the cost of destroying one (instead of the current situation where creating is much cheaper than destroying leading to dust).

I'm speaking for myself although i believe to have read this being said (better) by different Core devs. I haven't been corrected by anyone yet so far. And it does make a shitload of sense if you think about it.
"Money" is "trust". Trust that tomorrow you'll be able to spend what you receive today.
A hard fork changes the rules of the game mid-game. That's already a rumbling warning if that's even possible.
But then if a contentious hard fork happens there is going to be a minority that gets fucked over. 40%, 25%, 10%, 1%... The number doesn't really matter because for everyone with a brain, even those in the majority this time, that should be a glaring warning that the next time THEY might be the minority.
By that argument only 100% would work and seeing that Core has invented methods for doing almost anything (including block size limits) through soft forks, we might never even have to try. And note that soft forks are (especially after some upcoming improvements like versionbits) akin to a democratic system where devs of even different teams can independently introduce new features and users will be able to vote on them simply by choosing to use them or not.
If we do have to do a hard fork, of course in practice absolute 100% is impossible. For one because it's actually impossible to measure. Another reason is that there are bound to be people that are lazy or simply forget to update. People still run Windows XP or even older. The only way to alleviate that is to make the update itself not be a fuck-over but a really transparent obviously-good and without doubt a well intended change that simply had no alternative way to be done.
As you can see the slippery slope starts already. But you can also see that it doesn't matter that computer code doesn't have a definition for "near" as these things are impossible to express or even measure in computer code anyway.

Miners are not one entity (at least not yet). Some CAN handle bigger blocks some CANNOT. Likely bigger miners CAN and smaller miners CANNOT.
Why would a large miner give a fuck if 10% of the network can not handle his large blocks? Push 10% of the competition out and add 10% to your own profits.
And a month later do it again to the next 10%. Rinse and repeat.
And fuck off with the limit != size bullshit, you know a miner can fill a block with whatever he wants at 0 cost!

The first invalid (too big) block mined by classic will be rejected by full Bitcoin nodes. As far as I know peers that send this block to my node, my node will quickly kick and ban those IP addresses, so soon after that I will only be connected to real Bitcoin nodes.
SPV clients are not as smart though, so they may still end up being screwed by confirmations on the wrong chain.
@_date: 2016-01-29 00:49:28
You should explain SW as about 1.7 MB effective block size. That's a fair estimate assuming a fair mix of normal and multisig transactions. SW gives more benefits to multisig transactions than to normal so it's hard to exactly predict. No need to overstate it as that gives ammunition to trolls.

It's also funny cause he's clearly not a scientist at all. He's a bit of a politician and a bit of an engineer, but clearly out of his depth when science comes in.
His call for alternative implementations which was questionable to me back then, but I now know it's obviously complete bogus and proven wrong. But it does fit nicely with his hard forking infighting and political ambitions.

A soft fork doesn't create a new chain at all. That's almost the definition of soft fork. The soft forked blocks are compatible and old nodes and old miners will just allow them.
In case of SegWit the people that do soft fork would like to have the protection of the majority of economic power because otherwise old miners could steal their money. The majority of full nodes already support SegWit, but for safety it would be nice to have the support of 95% of miners as well. Just to prevent messy situations.

1) Information gets outdated and especially in open source projects it often happens that websites are not fully up to date. You're welcome to gather correct data and volunteer to keep the website up to date. Be warned that the information will be out of date once you type it, since the development is still very much in flux and new ideas for improvements come up weekly on the LN mailing list.
2) Again: don't forget the time dimension. My own out-of-my-ass prediction of LN handling 50% of all transactions in March next year is not in contradiction with the best-case-far-in-the-future napkin calculation that the LN inventors did in their presentation. They're talking about a far distant future where USD and EUR don't exist anymore and 7 Billion people around the world are all only using Bitcoin exclusively. How likely is such a situation anyway? Yet it's good that it's being considered as it would suck if we get to 25% of the world population and then suddenly it turns out the system can't do anymore and we have to start over. The IP address space in IPv4 is a nice example of such a mistake.
That's an upper-bound calculation. It's not a promise that it will do that flawlessly from day 1 or ever. Just like IPv6 address space never be fully used, nor would today's internet be able to handle even 1% of that many hosts.
Even though you could say some information is outdated, it's also the reader's responsibility to correctly distinguish promises and hypothetical situations.

Exactly. As stakeholders (having invested in bitcoin and mining equipment) they have a say just like any other stakeholder. Purely as miner they need to shut up and do as told or be fired. That includes staying decentralised.

Twist. You said:  




And some more, which I summarized as "toilet paper". So in short you were arguing that because toilet paper transactions are not Bitcoin transactions therefore LN transactions are not Bitcoin transactions either. Fallacy, but I don't expect you to understand logic. Which btw is nicely proven by:


One doesn't follow the other, and in the case of LN most of your points are untrue if not opposite of the truth. i.e. FUD.
Which nicely proves I was on the right track when I said your only goal was to try to make LN sound inferior. i.e. FUD again.

Are you talking about the version nr and such? Not entirely sure how many buy we're talking a few bytes here. Which will likely be cleaned up in the upcoming hardfork.
Also segwit will allow for Aggregated Signatures, which make transactions up to 40% smaller (do that 10000000000x !).
@_date: 2016-03-30 19:27:57
Nice twist to try to make the issue about the word "HardFork"... It's about the word "Contentious" as in "the classic proposal is a Contentious Hard Fork". And it's contentious because it's braindead stupid and luckily most people aren't stupid enough to fall for it.
Any well planned, well worked out, well tested and uncontentious hard fork (all words foreign to classic trolls) is welcome (by definition) and will be rolled out.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:13:02
Also keep in mind that coinbase and such exchanges are already today doing many transactions off-chain. Those certainly don't pay you any fees and are in fact a systemic risk to Bitcoin as a whole, just like MtGox was.
LN solves the systemic risk part and also makes sure you'll actually see some fees from opening and closing transactions.
The rest of your blocks can be filled with higher value/higher risk transactions that thus will happily pay a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:13:31
Dude. It's not about block size. It's about decentralization and control. Bitcoin is dead if you give control to Ver and Jihan or any other central party.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:49:54


I know. And I didn't say it did. 


I haven't read BIP148 (I should), so you may well be correct. But that sounds really dumb to me (I might be missing something). Why would they, especially knowing they're the minority, reject perfectly valid blocks that would help them achieve a longer most-work chain and in effect help protect them against attacks? That truly doesn't make sense to me at all.


Neutral miners don't mine segwit-invalid transactions to begin with. They need to be actively altered to mine any of those, which by definition puts them into the anti-segwit camp. Neutral miners also don't need to know what chain to follow, by definition they will always follow the most-work chain that is valid under their rules. If that's the anti-segwit chain, that's fine. They're still neutral. That's what neutral means: they don't pick sides, they just do their own thing, using the rules set out by Satoshi.


That can only be initiated through an active attack by the anti-segwit miners. SegWit and neutral miners are perfectly compatible back and forth and could co-exist for decades.


Miners don't, unless actively re-programmed to be, mine transactions with unused OP code.
Anyway, as mentioned, some of the above is based on my assumption that UASW is simply plain SW but without waiting for the 95% miners signaling activation. I really should read up on BIP148.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:44:42
You're​ assuming those miners to be actively evil. All that a soft fork needs is for miners that don't care to mind their own business and not to actively go out of their way to attack the soft fork.
Miners that just run decent mining software that is not actively tweaked to go and actively try to steal money (which is risky) will do nothing to hurt SW.
Hard to imagine maybe in this climate of prisms and war and hostile takeover talk, but it's not that far fetched to carefully do the UASF with only a few and small transactions that are not worth the trouble to steal. Then SW can prove to everyone that it's safe and stable and fine. Then more miners will actively start supporting it. (To get the higher fees from the large blocks for example.)
@_date: 2016-03-03 03:22:19
Yeah that's what I'm saying. Once the network growth stops going vertical to more moderate growth then there's a chance for smaller numbers to get a hold of hardware that is not obsolete by the time it clears customs (a force that centralises towards china as all chips are manufactured there so shipping and customs can be a significant delay). Currently there just not enough time for the hardware to trickle down, is obsolete before it gets there. And obsolete really means obsolete, not like an old laptop where you add some memory and an SSD and it's good to go for a few more years of decent use.
That's why I'm saying currently uncomfortable level of centralisation, but hope for improvement. 


This is actually not true. It took months. I recently heard an account of that whole ordeal (i was around when it happened but not super interested in it). I think it was one of the recent LTB episodes with Andreas, not entirely sure. Anyway it was worse than i thought, and certainly not a swift abandonment of GHash.
More like the swift abandonment of MtGox after everyone was screaming for months or years to get your money out of there.
Also as far as i know do most of the current big pools own the overwhelming majority of the hashing power themselves. There's not that much power that can actually switch.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:47:17


Bitcoin will be dead if the fork happens. Noone can trust their investment in something that changes the rules mid-game on the whim of some mob du jour. Even if anything survives out of an outright war like that, growth will be over.

Love that description. Very fitting and recognisable
@_date: 2016-03-22 00:08:58
Well, transactions with more signatures (many inputs or multi-sig) have more signature bytes, so they still get a higher discount compared to a transaction with 1 input and many outputs.
Note how that is a nice advantage too: splitting one coin into many (growth in UTXO set) costs more than combing many inputs into 1 coin (decreasing the UTXO set).
But yeah you're right to a large degree the discount equalises when everyone uses segwit transactions.
But of course fee is relative anyway, if miners device they want higher fees (after the halving for example) then they could try to raise them by requiring higher fees.
Also note that because multisig transactions have more signature data and therefore benefit from the discount more (without disadvantaging other transactions). If those become popular (Lightning Network uses them and many smart contacts or escrow services etc.) then the total block size might go even higher than 2MB with segwit alone. 1.8MB is a decent estimate based on current transaction usage, but it can grow.
If you're interested in future growth other than a boring block size limit increase (which will likely come as you said) do also check out Aggregated Signatures by Gregory Maxwell. That could allow up to 40% smaller transactions (plus a shitload of other even more important benefits) maybe even before said hard fork (my wishful thinking, i don't think any core dev has given a time estimate on that).

Total lie. That's not how soft forks work. Non upgrades clients are left with waay more security than just SPV level.
And hard forks leave 0 (zero, nothing) security for non upgraded clients, so you must be agreeing that hard forks are dangerous and not suitable when the issue is contentious.


"Pushing through" are not words you want to use when comparing to a hard fork. A hard fork pushes shit down people throats.

Those buyers would like to know what they're buying, make sure they don't get counterfeit coins. And once they've bought them, they want to protect them against some attacker making their coins worthless. That's where full nodes comes in.
The fact that currently a lot of buyers don't run a full node, or worse store their coins on an exchange (facepalm) doesn't take away from the fact that the only way to be sure about ones coins without trusting anybody else is by running a full node.


Quite likely. And those people will be the first to lose their money once an attack happens. And by being so careless they're actually a hazard to the entire Bitcoin system. For example if coinbase goes the way of MtGox, it will at the very least drop the price, maybe for years, like MtGox did. And another kind of hazard is an evil fork that those people will blindly follow and they will only notice once it's way too late to turn back.
... sorry, gotta run.

Nobody *wants* higher fees for the sake of higher fees. Of course not. Everybody would be happy if it were possible to  have free transactions. Just like everybody wants free icecream.
But the universe doesn't owe anybody free transactions, nor free icecream.
So the reality is someone needs to pay for the cost (all costs) and thus that fees are required. Fees don't pay for all costs though, so they are also required to dissuade freeloaders from externalizing their cost onto others. The reality is that spammers happily spam if the fee is low. So yes, higher fees (compared to back then when nullc made that statement) are what is wanted to prevent spam and get a stable working healthy supply/demand driven fee market consisting of actual users.

Highly doubt they have that large a % actually. As well as  that they will be so mind boggling stupid to block the size increase they've been whining for for so long. And if they do, it merely proves their level of stupidity and dishonesty even more. (Which tbh wouldn't surprise me one bit.)
Luckily core has patience and if necessary lowering the 95% is actually easy, as opposed to starting out with a criminally insane dangerous 75% that cannot be adjusted upwards.
It's gonna be a laugh.

If experts with decades of experience tell you that a simple increase right now will cause more problems than its worth, that Bitcoin needs to improve first before it can handle more, why not consider them?
Everyone in here has the wish to size bitcoin up. Of course they do.
But no amount of wishful thinking will make problems go away. Problems that can only go away with dedicated hard work. And Core has been doing exactly that over the last few years. If you haven't noticed all the speed improvements and lower orphan rates that's because they've been been largely offset by the blockchain growth, indicating how close we are to the limit. Luckily the upcoming version (release candidate now) will have some huge improvements again which is why Core sees the possibility to do an increase to 1.75MB soon.

Thx. You're welcome. I had to read the respective lines on irc twice to sort of get it, but it's good to have spelled it out now, for my own understanding as well.
You're right they were probably not aiming for 93.67%. 95% was probably just a ballpark estimate and nice sounding round number, but probably not far off from what was desired and deemed safe.
That doesn't mean 95% is set in stone (yet), conditions may change and it might depend on a lot of factors, but now that there has been a little bit of experience rolling out soft forks, we know that it's a pretty decent number. Yet people might be a bit wary of changing the number, even implicitly. As Greg was on the IRC.

For clarity, by "empty block" you're talking about the block AFTER the attacker's block. The attacker's block may still contain invalid transactions.


I don;'t see anything limiting the string. When an empty block is found (or the attacker finds another block himself) then miners will continue on a 3rd block, again head-first. So 3 confirmations is quite possible. Any block by the attacker can again have more invalid transactions, all other blocks will be empty but still count as confirmation. (maybe it would have not to count empty blocks as confirmation in general, but SPV nodes can't check that).


That's always the case, but that doesn't mean attacks don't exist and might be worthwhile depending on certain variables. The problem here is that the attacker only creates one invalid block and the rest of the network does all the hard work for him by creating empty blocks on top of it. The attacker could even switch back to a valid block while the rest of the network is wasting its time.
Validationless and head-first mining means unaware miners are ASSISTING an attacker. Or from a different viewpoint: an attacker can completely shut down the whole hashing network temporarily, because everyone is wasting their cycles on invalid crap.
And what do the bitcoin users get out of this best case? Empty blocks. i.e. nothing. The only good thing is that (ignoring attacks) the orphan rates should go down, which is good for decentralization. Except that I would expect that large miners could get away with simply delaying the blocks by ~30s to get back in the exact same (centralizing) situation as we are now.

He's exactly right. And in case you didn't notice, your spam attack proves:
 * blocks are not full, there's plenty of room for spam
 * the world is not ending as the FUD trolls (including gavin) were claiming
 * 2MB or 8MB would be just as easily spammed, so the argument  "limit" doesn't mean "actual size" is made irrelevant.
 * RBF is a good thing and clearly the only solution to stuck transactions.
 * Fees need to rise
@_date: 2016-01-17 19:51:56
No and that's exactly what i mean. Things seem simple but they're not.
To begin with there is no such thing as time in a decentralised system, that's why the blockchain is necessary in the first place. You don't know how old a transaction is. What if it gets reintroduced after you threw it out?
Yeah i know you'll be able to come up with answers and what-ifs to those questions, I'm not going to do a full analysis here even if i could. Core devs have done those.
You can be certain that anything simple has been thought and considered a hundred times by the devs.
It's a bit like thinking of ways to do email spam filtering. Seems simple from a distance but once you start polling at a few naive simple ideas it turns out to get more and more complicated.

I am not (and I don't think anyone actually is) claiming 0conf should never be used. Of course anyone can decide that for themselves and there are a lot of measures people can take to defend themselves and lower the risks. Both with bitcoin as well as the physical world (cameras, face to face, Insure against the risk, etc.).
One problem is that people think it's safe. Safer than it actually is. Low awareness is bad. It leads to things like mtgox, address reuse, miner centralisation and other bad things. Bitcoin must be robust for it to have value and that robustness must not depend on people dozing to sleep thinking everything is fine. And it can not rely on chargebacks either.
Another more immediate problem is that preserving an accidental minor feature ("0conf is not impossible") can make people think that 0conf is one of the design goals. That causes roadblocks for actual innovations that do make Bitcoin more robust. Like RBF.
And in this case it's even worse: RBF doesn't change the safety of 0conf at all and still people are throwing up roadblocks.
Anyway the good news is that LN will enable 100% safe instant payments, so the future is bright.

You still haven't passed that bullshit station? FUD. Very telling.
Even users that don't use SegWit transactions benefit from extra blockspace freed up by smarter people. So by definition a reduction in fee compared to everybody being an idiot.


There you go again equating soft forks with 51%attack. Because your FUD doesn't work without scare words.


No need. Full nodes can simply reject blocks.


Quite impossible. So you might as well quit your bullshit campaign right now. In fact satoshi expressly didn't try and even op penned up whole swaths of study fork opportunities and have them about points in the form of OP_NOPs. Clearly intentional. Clearly already agreed upon by all Bitcoin users.


Miners don't need a soft fork for that. Again trying to equate a situation where bitcoin already failed on its basic assumptions of decentralized mining with study forks. FUD.
Fees are the only defense against empty blocks and for has been working hard on getting a healthy fee market going. SegWit improves on that without resetting it like a 2MB HF would.


The defense against that is waiting for more confirmations. And possibly making transactions that are only valid on one chain.


Doesn't even need a majority as long as the others don't actively attack it. That's the only reason we'd like miners to signal when they're ready.


A requires B didn't mean that all that requires B is A. For something to be a 51%attack it needs to be an attack to begin with.
Your manipulative bullshit is that you are trying to equate soft fork = 51%attack and therefore bad and therefore all soft forks are bad and therefore hard fork. Complete and utter bullshit shit that falls apart at the first step, and is clearly disproven by the fact (among many others) that Satoshi actively designed, enabled and used them for his own updates. FUD.
And all clearly irrelevant today in the context of SegWit as SegWit is not an attack in any way, not technical nor any other, and backed by a great majority of nodes that already want it. Even backed by honest bigblockers that wanted 2MB last year and haven't moved the goalposts.
It's also clearly not a 51% anything as it requires 95%, so yet again invalidating your whole tirade.

That's possibly the first actual use case for altcoins I've heard: to keep the GPU mines alive and on standby in case we need to change the PoW algorithm. Wow, thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:26:08


That was the starting point of my thinking, yeah.


Nope. As long as you mine into my address, I don't care what you put in the block.
One of the reasons I was thinking this might be a good starting point, is that negotiating a block beforehand takes a little time. Time negotiating is wasted time not mining. That's why I was thinking: just one address (or even a deterministic new address for each new block) means zero added latency before miners can start working on the next block.
That shifts the problem of proving that you found a share for a valid block, with the correct address, in order to collect your payment, to a point in time where it can be done in parallel and latency isn't very important anymore. (Still many incentive/adversarial problems left, but that was the goal.)


Depends on how the reward is split. If it can be done completely honestly exactly according to how many shares each mined, then it doesn't matter whether you're the invitor or invitee. If that's impossible then there needs to be a balance where the invitor takes the risk of variance while joiners simply get paid per share and don't care whether a real block gets found or not. (that's a lot like how it works today, so less ideal solution I guess).
I'll re-read your post later. Not have much time now for concentrated reading.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:40:37
The new PoW is by definition more or equal work than what it replaces. That's the whole point of this gradual shift from one to the other.
Yes, it sends a signal to the miners. Fuck with us and we kill your investment. Which is exactly what we need. We don't need huge miners investing hundreds of millions, we need many smaller individual miners. This cuts off one economy of scales avenue by adding a risk of losing your whole investment.

Nope. Nakamoto consensus is for ordering transactions within a known and already existing rule set.
You can start an altcoin and lure people to use it. That has nothing to do with Nakamoto consensus though, that's just free market and everybody choosing for themselves.

@_date: 2016-01-14 12:53:18
All wrong.
Rules have been established to define what consensus about transaction ordering means and those rules are very specific for the currency application that bitcoin is.
Consensus about those rules is a whole different level of consensus. That's like a 3d printer that can print itself, which 3d printers one day might (not yet) but bitcoin never will.
If you want to get consensus to get your grandma for president then OBVIOUSLY that falls outside the scope of bitcoin, no matter how much out of context you quote satoshi. Same goes for getting consensus about changing the rules of Bitcoin itself.
You are confusing different contexts for the same word "consensus" which have absolutely nothing to do with each other.

If everybody trusts one (or a few) central party/node then the whole of Bitcoin is pointless. That's just paypal. That extreme is clear.
So the idea and power of decentralization is that as many and diverse people as possible protect their own economic share of Bitcoin and by doing that, they also help protect the whole of Bitcoin. More people makes it harder for an attacker to fool, persuade, brainwash, force, buy, hijack, kill, jail, enough of those node owners to make his attack likely to succeed.
It's not about the number itself, as those numbers are easily faked. Running 10 nodes doesn't help any more than running one.

Note also how weights are not in bytes but are dimensionless numbers.


Glad you're back to understanding that your previous claim is nonsense:


There's no such thing as an extra block or "main non-witness block". It's all mixed in together into one block with one of two weights applied to each byte.

It's about the total block rewards per unit of time, right? 6 x 24 x ~14BTC x $1000 per day. Where some altcoin pays out a fraction of that plus suffers from reduced block rate making it even a fraction of that. Sure, one lone miner may scrape up those crumbs, but 99% would instantly be mining Bitcoin.

If you have 3 rolls instead of one, your chance of getting a 6 are tripled.


Only if you don't throw 6 the first time.


That someone else may have the same wish for a 6. Or they can be orphaned if the stakes are high enough.
Bottom line is that miners can influence the numbers (at a cost), so you can't let very high stake decisions depend on them. And since those stakes and chances are often immeasurable, it's very dangerous to let anything depend on it to begin with: if some online casino is using those number to decide who wins, then how do you know if people are maybe betting millions$ and thus providing a millions$ incentive for a miner to try to pick the number?
Coming back on topic: I think this thread started with selecting a random new PoW algo every X time. The choices must be known in advance and can thus be built into the ASICs before hand and then the random number simply select which of the algo's implemented in the ASIC gets run and the rest stay idle. That's probably a slight one off extra cost, but otherwise has no impact on the ASICs.

I'm saying the occasional 4MB block that's already strongly disincentivised (and more so after each halvening) is not comparable to an always full 4MB hard forked block.
Also: 4MB SegWit blocks can, of it really comes to that, easily be countered by simply orphaning/invalidating those blocks.
Bottom line: your argument was 4MB is safe because SegWit max is 4MB is nonsense and you need to do dissing that misinformational lie.
That's regardless of whether 4MB is safe or not. Comparing it to SegWit 4MB is simply dishonest and not a valid argument for it.


Yeah. 1 4MB block is not unsafe. All blocks being 4MB is unsafe.
And safety has to do with centralization pressure. I don't think there's much pressure for other miners to join the retard that's creating 4MB SegWit blocks. 4MB blocks full with fee paying transactions on the other hand does have an influence on the centralization balance.


Funny how not a single HF proposal over the years has had soft limits in place, but you're using them to handwave away real arguments against too big blocks. Btw soft limits are nonsense: either the limit is enforced or miners will just grab the fees and fill the blocks up. They didn't a few years ago because the fees were still works back then. They're not anymore today.




Yeah. Me too. Be open to arguments and let go of the rbtc misinformation. Smart people have been exploring these trails for many years now, unless you discover a radically new insight you're just repeating mistakes. Which is ok as long as you learn from them, but shouting out to others that you've found the way out and leading them down the same muddy dead end trail is not helping.


Yes. Basically everybody wants that, provided is safe. SegWit does that. And you know the one thing that's undeniably even more awesome than bigger blocks? Smaller transactions. SegWit opens up pathways that will drastically reduce transaction sizes. How about doubling or tripling the transaction throughput without raising the blocksize at all? Guaranteed no reduction in safety!
You're blocking no-brainer progress that can get you something better than you think you want. It's like huge facepalm.
The time to whine about hard fork block size increases is after SegWit+Schnorr+SA+MAST. Well already have more than 4x scaling by then, more than your 4MB blocks. In the meantime is perfectly fine to work on proposals and do research on it. Core devs have been doing that for years. It's good to be ready once it starts getting urgent. Although by that time we can do block size increases through study forks, so it might be unnecessary to even do a hard fork at all. Although i think everybody is in favour of doing an uncontentious hard fork at least once to clean up some small mistakes and technical debt left by Satoshi and years of changes.


A hard fork is a change of protocol. By definition. A soft fork is merely drawing in a piece of the existing protocol specifically left unspecified for the purpose of drawing it in later.
SegWit is like (re)purposing a bit or field in the TCP header to improve the protocol. It's still TCP and can still communicate with old TCP clients, but when two peers both support the new feature they get more efficient communication. That's something that happened many times over the lifetime of TCP. And over the lifetime of Bitcoin too. SegWit is just another in a line of many such improvements.
The sooner you open your mind, and stop supporting the biggest attack on Bitcoin to date, the sooner you can put your programming skills to good use.
Leave that lying Ver loser already.

How much did you pay for the development and usage of Bitcoin? Right. It's free.
Also: BlockStream only pays a handful of the core devs, don't confuse core with BlockStream.
Good. Good luck. Hope it works out. Core can always use more eyes and hands.

They have for a very long time and it's in the roadmap a month before classic even started.

1.75 MB with actual scalability benefits and the backing of 60 very experienced and hard working devs.
2MB, zero scalability benefits, maybe no DDOS holes, completely ruined community as well as ruined money supply by 2 burnt out very inactive former devs + 2 failed altcoin devs with zero experience. Peter R is not even a dev.
For what? 250kb difference while blocks aren't even full yet.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:14:48
Agree to all that.
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:05:53
SegWit is even more backwards compatible than you think. Old non SegWit blocks are perfectly fine and will be accepted by SegWit miners.
In the normal SW the 5% does not need to update at all, they could keep mining old blocks for another 10 years. (They'll get halve the fee income because of their smaller blocks, but that's their own problem.)
Same with UASW: not upgraded miners are just fine and actually help secure the SegWit chain as long as they don't actively go out of their way to try to steal people's money.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:25:01
You're so missing the point by focusing on the %.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:44:13
Wow. The fact that this isn't glaringly obvious to you is telling. Very telling. (Also not surprising though as it's at the heart of the misunderstanding and misinformation being spread in rbtc and around the flawed BU idea.)
The simple answer is: I have a bakery and my full node tells those miners to go fuck themselves and their non-bitcoin toy coins. And so will the electric power companies.
In fact my full node doesn't tell them to fuck off, is more like "haven't seen any transaction on this address at all" and then i tell them to fuck off.
Full nodes decide which block contains Bitcoins and which doesn't by validating the Bitcoin rules. 
This is all before any price effect comes into play. Chaos, confusion and uncertainty will certainly lower the price, for everybody.
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:37:54

I knew about that. pb1x nicely countered that already.
Still makes the implications you were trying to draw dishonest, showing that you were just FUDding (possibly without realising, but FUD nonetheless).
Same goes for your continued hammering on the "4MB SegWit thus 4MB hard fork would also be safe". Which you nicely avoided responding to here btw.
To repeat: a 4MB SegWit block is a costly attack for a miner for no gain whatsoever. Puny attempt at DoS attack.
A 4MB hard fork block will be rewarded with the highest possible free income, so making a smaller block would just be stupid. Hence it will be 99% 4MB blocks from the hard fork on.
Now look at the blockchain growth, bandwidth usage, CPU usage and any other metric having to deal with scaling and the conclusion is obvious. These solutions are not even remotely the same or equally dangerous.
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:29:22


Actually it was. Otherwise Gavin and Hearn would have just increased it to the sky by now. Bitcoin would have been dead by now with those two at the helm.


Temporary as in SegWit increases it after a lot of preparatory hard work making it safe to do so. Not temporary as in whenever you feel like it.


Thanks for confirming my statement.
There certainly are still spam attacks. Just yesterday someone find a chain of transactions just sending money in circles for the last 2 months. But today is much more costly for the spammer and all things equal that makes it a shitload less spam than the wild have been with non-full near-zero fee blocks.

Yeah, so coinbase offchain transactions are even worse for him as he will see 0 fees from there. At least with LN he'll see regular open+close transactions plus likely a huge increase in users because of a whole new use case, of trustless 0-conf coffee purchases, opening up.
And all coinbase like offchain transactions are a direct threat to Bitcoin as a whole, so letting that grow is very irresponsible. If coinbase gets hacked today the selling pressure from the coins will be larger than MtGox ever was. Bitcoin price is the most direct way to tank the miners' income.
LN transactions don't have those risks and can actually reduce the threat coinbase and others pose.
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:37:08
NO! No no! Of course not!
I said they can steal it _unfortunately_. And I'm saying I wouldn't be surprised they would even fuck that up.
Not sure how you read support for classic into that.
What I was saying is that because libsecp256k is finished, your argument to hope that Greg will stay working on it is kind of moot now. It's not going to get orders of magnitude faster anymore no matter how much he works on it (I'm assuming, as they've been squeezing very hard already).
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:02:58
Thanks for asking the question, I hope you consider all answers.
. Bitcoin consensus is a method of reaching consensus ON the ordering of transactions by means of PoW, a blockchain and rules that define all of those.
It is however NOT a method to reach consensus ON the PoW nor the blockchain specs nor the rules that define them.
I think you know this. And i don't think you can deny this.
. Core already had 1.75 MB on the roadmap before this classic thing even started. Are you willing to risk it all for a mere 250kb more? Sounds dramatic but that's how risk works: if there's a tying chance for something to happen then that's a risk you need to take into account.
. 75% is clearly waaay to low and contentious. Especially if the only thing that's measured by (can be measured by) is mining support. Don't say representative democracy because if there's even slight margin of error where miners don't represent 100% correctly (and by definition there is) that means your 75% may be significantly lower in practice.
. You are taking about replacing 30? 60? experienced developers with two brand new ones.
. It means at least 25% are going to be fucked over. This time you claim to be the majority, but some next time you will be the minority that gets fucked over. That is exactly what will be in the mind of any potential investor: why invest in something where the rules can change mid game? A very dangerous precedent.
. A hard fork is literally a  hostile takeover because you are not skilled enough to convince others to join you in consensus.
. With 25% and the timeline now being threatened!  you know it's going to be very messy. Even just the number of people that don't know they need to update
@_date: 2016-01-29 15:06:36


Correct. Plus the assumption of future improvements that SW makes possible.


Let's hope they realize that themselves. Do note that in principle large miners do have an incentive to centralize and push out the small miners (by for example increasing the block size). You would hope that their incentive to see Bitcoin grow and be successful is larger...
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:54:42

@_date: 2017-03-10 11:40:09
Not true. It cut down on spam a lot. A year ago there were many many more empty or half empty blocks. And SegWit more than doubles capacity.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:18:36
Beautiful. Awesome. I knew about the first part but hadn't connected the dots yet. Thank you!
Perpetual block rewards always sounded a bit more fair to me as in a fee-only configuration, hodlers get a free ride, not paying for the security they enjoy. But this is a nice technical argument why security from fees is worth more than security from inflation.
Makes me wonder if Satoshi already realised this and that was his reason for going for fees instead of taking the easy way out.
Also, for the record, having transactions refer to a block is not surelyat possible yet, correct? I've seen posts where after SegWit this could easily enabled, I think.

The point of a compromise is not the compromise itself. It's to arrive at a solid solution that is safe and sensible but still pleases as many people as possible.
And threats like that are just completely ridiculous. You think onlookers thinking to invest in bitcoin look at that and say "gee they're constantly having these wars that need to be settled on arbitrary values instead of reason, merely to keep people happy that don't want to see the error. Otherwise they threaten to go kamikaze. Oh and there's an attempt to make aroadmap to provide some clarity and stability, but then the compromise forces them to flipflop on that too. Yeah awesome, let's invest in that.

Correct. Not slaves. Payed workers. They can leave any time they like. Or the users can stop paying.


Only to the very ignorant short term miners. Bitcoin will plummet in price or cease to exist completely. Burning $2million in electricity every day just to run a crappy version of PayPal 2 is not something that anyone is willing to pay for.


Not with the endless stream of fuckups with security holes and bugs. Not without running closed source "trust us" binaries on your mining rig. WTF


It's over the one and only fundamental property that is the basis for everything else that is good and special about Bitcoin. That property depends on different parameters/rules. The parameter in question is make or break.


You're nutts. Wishful thinking is useless.


Huge IFF. Which is a actually an on impossibility bordering improbability as proven by BU's track record of bugs-only changes, as well as the ever more centralizing miners.


What evidence? The fact that 1MB blocksize is too large, as proven by the current miner centralization? Yeah. Mostly thanks to Gavin (and Hearn) for that.


That responsibility is ultimately with the users (the ones that trusted Gavin in this case), not with devs. The current devs warned us for many years. You can't blame them.


False conclusion. Improving the processes and awareness so that users trust devs less is the answer. Users who trust a handful of devs, especially with track records full of bugs and lies, are certainly not to be trusted ever. But also the veterans must be kept under tight scrutiny.


Not sure what that means. Yeah, higher fees will further push out spam and lower demand, forcing an equilibrium where it's easy to get your transactions into in a predictable manner. Or maybe you mean with LN, then yes fees are irrelevant for small value transactions so the block can be used for higher value transactions.

Flawed logic.
Not only is this minority as you call it, the only group of people in the world skilled and experienced enough to work on this stuff at the moment, so there is no choice. All their work and discussion is in the open though, so this is easily mitigated by simply verifying.
Also they have been and are working hard on embedding democracy into Bitcoin itself. Soon it will be possible for anyone to roll their own preferred feature into a sidechain or soft fork and do just it. Completely permissionless! End users will get to decide which soft fork survives and which doesn't.

I'm understanding less and less of what you're saying. Not sure where it went wrong above. I can tell English is not your mother tongue and I've tried to understand your sentences despite that, but I guess I failed somewhere.
I have no idea who you are. Are you coding an altcoin or on one of the Bitcoin forks or your own implementation? Or are you talking about making a BIP for a HF to clean up the SegWit leftovers? That last one sounds useful and is sort of in the planning in Core anyway, as far as I know. I'm sure they would be happy with someone actually doing the work.
If done before the block size doubling HF, maybe it can be combined into the same HF.

@_date: 2017-03-03 01:57:52
In case of a minority soft fork there's 3 groups of miners: those that follow the soft fork, those that don't care and simply keep mining non-soft fork blocks finally those that actively attack the soft fork by orphaning its blocks and/or even stealing the money.
If the majority is evil then yes they can keep re-orging the chain to orphan out the study fork blocks. But all nodes will still follow that longest (most work) chain, so there's actually no chain fork at all.
The soft fork is simply unreliable or even failing at that point, but consensus about what the chaintip is, is not lost. No hard fork.
There's not 2 chains, only temporary branches of the same chain. One of those branches then dies off. Same as happens daily currently, although that's usually only a 1 or 2 block branch.
Both branches are strictly compatible, the fact that some evil miners are actively orphaning one of the branches is just a 51% attack. No rules are changed. No hard fork.

Last I heard was research that concluded 4MB was already problematic and they admitted to leaving a few aspects out of the scope of the study. Gotta look at the worst case conclusion and leave some safety margin, so SegWit seems pretty good tight fit.
For now I'm fairly confident that hash power support will pick up sometime soon and then go close to or over 95%. Then the blockers are really exposing their hypocrisy for the world to see. Then either they give in and SegWit activates normally or they start seeing their orphan rate shoot up.

They have the incentive to maximize fees. Anything that increases fees is a carrot. SegWit's increased safety, increased performance, increased flexibility, increased number of use cases and bigger blocks will all raise fee incomes.


There are ways around him. Users pay for hashing to do what users want and need. Hashers don't decide.


Coinbase today does offchain scaling which pays 0 fees to him and forms a systemic risk 10x what MtGox ever was. Every day LN can not roll out is growing that problem and costing him.

Miners are in a hurry to validate and build the next block.

Any comparison to democracies is irrelevant. The rules are supposed to be fking rocksolid, that's the promise of bitcoin. If you can't make an uncontentious proposal then there's something wrong with your proposal and bitcoin just chugs along until someone comes up with a better one.
If people invest in rocksolid but it turns out a minor majority can change the rules because some populist promised golden mountains, then it all turns to moush. Nothing rocksolid when once every 4 hard forks it's your turn to get fucked over. So also no reason to invest in it in the first place.

But second: they wouldn't need to steal. It's the customers that buy/sell BU-coins, not the exchanges themselves. If those coins vanish why would it be the exchange's fault?

False. Don't let the lies and misinformation fool you. SegWit is compatible backwards, forwards and sideways. Blocks mined by old miners are perfectly fine for everybody. And so are SegWit blocks: valid for everybody.


There's no chain split at all unless evil miners actively create a split. Which they can do without SegWit as well btw.

Wow... Gavin did some adversarial thinking? Wow, that's a first.
Sounds like an attack that really requires a huge majority of hashing power. Like 75% or more. I guess by that time we'll need to PoW anyway, as the current one has proven to be unsafe and untrustworthy and too centralized.
Or maybe just call the whole experiment quits and done with. The experiment just proved that indeed, humanity is just too stupid for its own good, confirming tens of thousands of years of prior data.
We'll just have to wait another few decades for someone else to come up with an even brighter smart idea than Satoshi did.
Anyway. I didn't mean to imply that we shouldn't defend at all. There's plenty of stuff to do. The nuke option. But there are likely still exploits remaining in the BU code, so we can simply knock them offline at strategic moments. Dumping the Bitcoin price is a defense as well: it punishes the miners almost as much as the nuke option and is an extremely clear signal that the market is not happy when shit gets pulled.

And precisely because there is $7B at stake, we have to do it in a scientific way, thinking, modeling, experimenting, keeping values on the safe side, testing, proving and only then roll it out.

Maybe I still haven't fully learnt how good humanity is in destroying itself. SegWit is such an incredible no brainer, it's so hard to imagine people with so much money at stake would not go for the obvious solution. Maybe I'm underestimating how much dirty money is short on Bitcoin or how much People like Ver stand to gain even more fleecing newcomers or pumping shitcoins 20x. Even a doubling of Bitcoin can't beat a 10x shitcoin pump.
On the other hand I was really scared the first time XT threatened to hard fork and was really getting ready to sell everything or prepare for replay attacks and all that. Maybe I'm overshooting to the other side now and have become too lenient.

Wow. Why don't you ask that burning important life saving question you have right here? That one you're too lazy (stupid probably better word) to research on your own and thus you have to demand the biggest and busiest genius on the planet to take time out of his day to personally give you an answer. Which you will certainly disregard right away and twist around into a conspiracy theory anyway.
Why don't you go do the same to president Trump? At least then you'd have a positive side effect on humanity. I hear he likes Twitter a lot.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:07:56
Cool. In that case:
35% : Maybe we should simply start using SegWit (carefully) and then orphan blocks where a miner tries to steal our money. Full Nodes have that power, the only scary thing is that it's hard to be sure that all full nodes are in the same camp, that's the only reason we ask miners to coordinate the activation. If they don't maybe we should just coordinate without miners and go for it. They'll quickly learn to not try to steal our money, that's all we ask for a soft fork. They don't need to support it, just not fuck with it. On the other hand, we still have some time, so no need to do drastic things just yet.
Political compromises are out of the question though. And so are hard forks.

Their interest in bitcoin succeeding is a million times larger than possibly maybe ever earn anything on sidechains. If bitcoin fails sidechairs are dead too.
They have explained very well what the problems and reasons are and anyone capable of seeing the logic agrees with them and sees the centralisation dangers. A conspiracy theory is simply not necessary right now.
Also these people have dedicated their lives to open source and freedom type stuff. It's not like we're talking about bill gates or Steve Jobs here. They have turned down better job offers and patents. Actually fought against patents. Actively fight and circumvent the us government banning of export of cryptography.
I don't ask for unconditional trust, but does an amazing track record not count for anything anymore? A little benefit when there's only doubt and no evidence?

Do you have data to show why 16 or 32 are somehow optimal? Then why bikeshedding? When you pull numbers out of your ass any is as good as any other.
Now Core actually has data to show that 1MB is currently at the edge of what's possible. Many optimisations and improvement (i.e. hard work) need to be done to allow a safe increase in block size limit. Luckily they have set out a roadmap and ARE working hard on doing exactly that. SW is a part of that and a big enabler for future improvements AND it doubles the effective size.
A simple hard fork for size increase will probably happen later.
Literally no one wants 1MB forever, that's just a troll srrawman.

@_date: 2017-03-25 22:55:14
Miners aren't supposed to be highly profitable. All but a small margin should be going to pay for the electricity bill. If that's not the case then that proves something is wrong: barriers to entry, unfair competition, Mafia tactics, that sort of thing.
The only time when mining may be overly profitable is shortly after the Bitcoin price shoots up. That should quickly restabalize though.

He had consulted with and had consensus from a lot of devs before posting it.


8 is still more than triple of just SegWit. Which is, together with the other optimizations mentioned in the road map, is something like more than 12x capacity of today's 1MB blocks. But if that's not meaningful to you...

It is. And has been for at least more than a year now. SegWit delivers more than bigblockers were demanding but then suddenly they moved the goal posts. It has grown more obvious over time, exposing more shady figures maybe collaborating but likely competing with each other (i.e. backstabbing).

@_date: 2017-03-25 23:13:22
False. He was only talking about SegWit blocks with the signatures missing. Not about non-segwit blocks that never had any extension block to begin with.
After SegWit activates, non SegWit miners can just keep mining and their blocks will still be accepted. And not ignored.
Ignoring them would be stupid as those miners are actually helping SegWit by adding confirmations. Pushing those miners into the anti-segwit camp would be pointless.
can you confirm please? (Sorry to bother you, this was a tough one to debunk already, but even harder since your explantation of the reorgs on testnet.)

Can't really be bothered to go back and read all the details. I'm not sure anymore what i said or what you said that may have triggered that. Rightly so or not. Sorry insofar i put you in a camp you don't belong in.


Well, actually pretty much everything can be done through study forks including block size increases. It's certainly not as nice and clean. I agree that ideally we'd have at least one good hard fork to come to fix all kinds of technical debt, clean up loose ends and set us on a path of further block size increases.


Depends on what that means. There's currently still transactions floating around from the "stress tests" of more than a year ago. I guess you don't consider those part of a backlog. But there you go: grey area.
Then there's the argument that yes bitcoin does require a backlog to have a functioning fee market. That seems pretty sensible to me, as that seems to be the only way to get some sort of fee required to keep out spam as well as slowly replace the block rewards to pay for security.


Not sure i have. I know satoshi was working on payment channels and had timelocking (both of which turned out to not work).

He's talking about the "scaling problem", not about scaling. And that's the whole problem why people don't understand and why they're judging things only by superficial promises of endless rainbows.
If you blow more air into a party balloon you are scaling. But you're not changing the scalability. The "scaling problem" refers to the fact that it's going to pop at some point!
To improve scalability you need to improve the quality of the balloon. Thicker skin, better material, etc. THEN you can start inflating again.

Why do we spends $millions a day on Bitcoin mining? Because it provides security. For example against 51% attacks.
* Sniping attacks: different miners keep trying to only build on the chain where they receive the 30BTC fee transaction. Meaning the network is partitioned into multiple infighting factions, instead of united against outside attackers.
* Validationless mining: miner mine a new block on top of one or more blocks they haven't even validated. This means empty blocks, but more importantly for all they know, they are HELPING an attacker extend his chain. Again undermining network security.
* Any random politician that gets 75% of the populace behind him is free to do a hard fork and split the security that way and again enticing a lot of infighting.
Put this (no doubt incomplete list) together and realise that an attacker can mostly TRIGGER these events at his own schedule and what security is left?
Remember 51% attack requires 51% of the largest partition of the network, which is by far NOT the same as the whole network!

Don't be so stupid and gullable. Of course 25% against is contentious.
Literally everything you say is based on... absolutely nothing...  worse than wishful thinking. You don't know any of all that. There is no experience. There is no research or data to indicate any of it, rather the opposite.
It's on the one that suggests a change to do proper research and prove that everything is safe.
I can think of many things that can and will go wrong and many more that could be attack vectors around the triggering of the HF or during the chaos following it.

And THAT's the reason why miner centralization is bad. And thus are Core people trying to stop it from getting worse, by doing hard complex work to actually improve Bitcoin efficiency instead of simply changing a constant that WILL make it centralization exponentially worse.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:49:41
Not sure if you're one of them or trying to defend them, but that's really dumb false logic. That is absolutely not how the math works.
Bottom line: miners don't care what the fee per byte is, they care about the total fee for an entire block. They don't care how many bytes are in the block (within the range we're talking about here). The discount means they can put MORE transactions in a block so they can make MORE fees. Period.
In this sense a 2.3MB hard fork without SegWit would have that exact same effect.
The only place where the fee per byte comes into the story is when the miners need to select which transactions to pick: to maximize their total fee income, they sort all transactions by fee per byte and take the top ones until the block is full. The discount doesn't change anything there.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:33:03
And disproven by history and logic. Miners have always quickly filled blocks once they had the chance and that was when fees were near nothing and block rewards were 99.9% of income. That's only going to happen much faster now that the ratio is shifting.
There's no reason for a miner not to include one more fee paying transaction until the max is hit. Not mining the extra transaction is just stupid and like giving money away.
@_date: 2016-01-26 10:56:12


That's just dumb. You want golden unicorns and you're screaming like a 3 year old "now, now, now!".
What Core needs to do is explain why it's currently impossible and not a good idea to raise the block size limit. And come up with better alternatives and a road map.

Are you expert c++ reader? Do you have integrate knowledge of the Bitcoin source code? Classic sure as hell don't so you better not parrot them.
2) Force on people.
Hard Forks force shit on people. SegWit you can ignore for 5 years and you'll be fine. Again complete lie either out of your ass or from a troll checklist.
3) To the detriment of miners? WTF?!  They get to include MORE data, that means MORE fees. WTF are you on about? Again out of your ass.
This has nothing to do with opinion or disagreeing, it's just complete bullshit out of your ass intended to waste other peoples time and spread FUD.
You either know what you're talking about and have a proven track record of not talking shit, then you can join the debate and have your opinion considered. If not, you can politely ask questions and hope people will educate you.
The way you and other trolls do it: stating dumbass opinions and fantasies as facts that people in the know need to debunk, but in the meantime confuse the hell out of other new comers, is poisoning as fuck.

It's still the same shit, dude.
You completely misunderstand the root cause of why people are against BU. All their bugs and lying and propaganda and scamming superiority complex and braindead stupid ideas are merely superficial annoyances.
This ec project simply takes the fundamental bad idea that defined BU as braindead and doomed from the very first minute of its existence. Granted, it takes away a lot of the other stupidity, but it doesn't fix anything.
I guess it's an improvement that it's not blocking SegWit anymore, but it's still fundamentally creating an incompatible non-consensus enforcing alternative client putting the whole ecosystem at risk. Just because of a stupid idea.
This is why we have the BIP process for Bitcoin. This is why we're not doing the Linux model of everybody and his cat running their own fork of the code: Bitcoin is about consensus and everybody doing the exact same thing. That is the reason of its existence: producing a chain that is in consensus. Everybody can make chains and has been for thousands of years. The ONLY thing special here is that Bitcoin lets everybody make the SAME chain and be sure about it.
What's the fucking point of running a fork project like that? Why don't you make a BIP and argue relentlessly on that? Or, if you're so sure of your superiority, why don't you create an altcoin and prove your technology? Either that altcoin overtakes Bitcoin or you prove that it works and Bitcoin will take it (through a BIP). And then you get to gloat that you were right.
You don't hijack a $20B economy by pumping and propagandizing an unproven braindead amateur astrology-hour wishful thought, just because it sounds so unicorny.

Yeah that was a first thought. Not saying it's an achievable goal.


If i give you my bitcoin address and you mine a block with that address as its coinbase, then i get 12.5 BTC + fees. So if you give me shares+blockheader so i can verify it and see that you are expending energy to mine that block with my address in it. If you went through the trouble of putting transactions in the block, I'll earn more on the fees.
If i pay you a fixed amount for each share then why would you bother putting transactions in? The extra money goes to me, not to you. That's why i probably should pay you a percentage, not a fixed amount.


As long as they're building on top of the same parent block, every miner can work on his own block which can be completely different from all other miners' blocks.

The fact that you promise unlimited first, with a huge amount of divisive rhetoric and insulting.
Then at some point you get it into your thick skull that maybe unlimited isn't gonna work, but instead of acknowledging you were wrong you go for 20MB and then 8 MB and now 2MB, because _finally_ you're seeing what experts have been saying all along (Are you really seeing it? Er is it your latest populist dream pusher du jour that you happen to listen to today).

I'm not really up to date with UASF. I'm all for it and hope it can be made to work, but I have my doubts it can be done without creating a mess. But pressure on miners is good nonetheless. They need to know they're obstructing Bitcoin.


I would be very surprised if it would be, as there's no reason to alienate miners that are not abusive (i.e. are not actively trying to steal money).


There is a risk to doing a 51% attack (unless you have &gt; 51% under your own direct control). And even then nodes could do a simple soft fork to invalidate your new chain and then the mainchain switches back to the SegWit chain. Orphaning a chain of multiple blocks is more risky than orphaning one block. So SegWit users (actually everybody) would definitely want to wait for more confirmations than usual.
I imagine UASF doesn't mean let's activate on flag day and then go full out with only SegWit transactions. I'd expect people to test the water very very carefully. Maybe a few Core devs can do some probing test transactions. And once we see miners trying to actively steal those funds (or censor SegWit blocks) then we can take measures and put more pressure on specifically those miners. As long as other miners stay neutral (with or without SegWit blocks) it should be possible to defeat those thieving miners. And then hopefully after a few months of that other miners see that it's the better option and start supporting SegWit too.
But like I said, I'm not up to date. That's just my imagination.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:06:16
I think we're using the term block differently and that makes it confusing. (Maybe I'm doing it wrong.)
Suppose block 10000 was found, then all miners start working on block 10001. But the contents of each candidate block can be completely different. It's not necessary (even practically impossible) that all miners work on the same candidate block. Each can have their own transactions in the order they wish and each will have their own coinbase address. Unless multiple miners work together, then they can use the same coinbase address.

Why do you keep insisting on backward nonsense? Your analogies make no sense and aren't relevant.
Users pay miners to do the work that users specify. Period. End of discussion.
Miners can do whatever they want but if they don't do what users want, they won't get paid. Just like in not posting for Litecoin or dash or ethereum or any shitcoin and of those miners do work for. 
Miners can go along quietly or by throwing a tantrum but they will come along or they will end up with 0 coins or 0 priced coins. Simple as that.
BU is the one that gives all the power to miners. Bitcoin specifically does NOT do that.

@_date: 2017-03-26 03:15:42


100% even. Yeah ok, i see where they're coming from. Just reject non segwit blocks for enough to activate. Would actually work ok if economic majority sticks to its guns and only accepts SegWit bitcoin as the only true Bitcoin.
I really should read the BIP, but one thought i have is that they should still allow that 5% of non SegWit blocks too, as that doesn't change the activation but may shorten the activation time as well as later give those miners an incentive to join that chain.
Anyway it sounds a bit too messy and risky, but mostly too pushy, for me. I should go read it. The miners are assholes for not activating SegWit asap and i wouldn't mind a PoW change to nuke them. But pushing SegWit on people that don't want it for other legitimate reasons is a bit too soon for me personally (although other than being against a blocksize increase i truly can't imagine a legitimate reason).


If that happens to be the most-work chain. Sure. That's why i called them neutral.


Yeah. For the purpose of these sorts of discussions, when saying "miner" i always mean the people creating the block template. The ones in control. It's mostly irrelevant who does the actual hashing. Unless you want to argue that hashers will change pool of the pool is doing evil. I think that argument was clearly debunked as not something we can or even want to rely on, with the ghash.io debacle.


Correct, but those had their bitcoind software actively altered to do that. That moves them out of the neutral camp.

You can stop wondering. SegWit is virtually required by all those further scaling steps, both on and off chain. Doing any of those steps without first doing SegWit is braindead and will cause a shitload of more work that in the end comes down to exactly SegWit anyway. SegWit is the only sane and natural way to fix the problems it fixes.

That's a first mistake, I think. There's no such thing as unprofitable mining. If you're mining machine isn't making a profit you turn it off -&gt; difficulty adjusts and it's profitable for other miners. Yes there are short term nuances, but overall that's the big picture.
If mining is very profitable then more miners will quickly appear to take part of that profit making it less profitable for everybody as well as increasing the difficulty thus closing the gap.
The trend is always towards roughly (100% - minimum acceptable margin to put food on the table) of the block rewards being spent on electricity and equipment.
That feedback loop inherently has some latency in it. It takes several months to design ASICs, produce them, buy them, ship them, build a facility near a power station, install the ASICs etc. That sounds like a huge lag, but there are at least a few factors that reduce that latency:
1) existing miners can overclock or underclock. If the Bitcoin price is high  (or the fees in the mining pool are exceptionally high) they can overclock their existing machine (or switch on spare machines) to mine faster spending more electricity. When the Bitcoin price drops, they can underclock (or turn off) their machines to reduce electricity cost. So there's a bit of very low latency wiggle room.
2) People are predicting and anticipating the future (and as long as the Bitcoin price trends in one direction, i.e. up, they'll be right more often than not). And those people who are predict wrong are not losing money because mining isn't profitable, they're losing money because they made the wrong bet. They weren't mining, they were betting on a future Bitcoin price or mining landscape. All in all, the predictions lower the latency of ASICs coming online when they're needed and at the same time obsoleting the old machine.
So then remains: when is mining really profitable (as in getting rich profitable) : that's either when the difficulty shoots down (unlikely) or the Bitcoin price shoots up (that tends to happen every now and then). At that moment the race is on to rake in as many blocks as possible and get new ASICs online asap. And then the trend catches up and you're mining at a small margin again.


I'm saying the micropayments that LN users do require less security, so it makes sense that they pay less. If they would be required to pay full fee for each microtransaction, they would go elsewhere. Elsewhere would be exchanges like coinbase or other trusted parties which have a huge centralizing effect, storing huge amounts of bitcoin in one place creating huge systemic risk (bigger than MtGox) and they still wouldn't be paying the miners as their microtransactions will still be off chain.
There's no point in trying to block LN because only much worse alternatives exist. And if it really comes down to it, it's even impossible to block LN like this because LN can be done without SegWit. It's much smarter to be happy with the fees from opening and closing transactions and then the awesome new use case that will cause an influx of many users and make Bitcoin so much more practical for daily use.


It's not that LN provides security. Only PoW does that. It does leverage the security that the fees provide, making micropayments possible. But there's a natural balance to this. Small payments only make sense when such leverage is possible to keep the fees down. But a micropayment channel is inherently unsuitable for larger payments: if you have $100 in a channel and want to send $100 then you're draining your channel and you're paying fees twice for opening and closing the channel. That makes zero sense. Very roughly: opening a channel makes only sense for payments that are less than 25% of the channel amount of the smallest hop between you and the destination, OR if you expect to be sending amounts back and forth (equally!) through that same channel many times. Sending amounts over multiple hops restricts you even further to the capacity of the smallest channel. Also you do bear the opportunity cost of locking up money in the channel.
Plenty of reasons that larger amounts of money will always be going to be onchain and that's perfectly fine because $0.50 fee on a $100 transaction is fine.
Not sure if any of this answers your question. Sorry that it became so long. Also: I'm by no means an expert, but I've tried to stay away from unsubstantiated wishful thinking. I think.

Why would people start using it more AND pay a higher price both for acquisition AND usage if it's not working well for them? You're just seeing spam and trivial cups of coffee falling off. When was the last time you were thrown in prison for buying a cup of coffee?


Nobody. But a chain where the rules change willy nilly depending on what populist politician sways the sheep this month, is certainly worthless. We're aiming for digitial gold here: gold as in stable and predictable for thousands of years. Stability and predictability are key properties of Bitcoin. Not of all blockchains. It's not the question of "who says", it's a logical consequence that something not worthwhile investing in will not be invested in.


See first sentence: it is drastically changing even without rule changes. Simply by the increased real usage and higher price the usage patterns change and what Bitcoin means to people changes.
Plus that Core has continuously changed (evolved and improved) Bitcoin all these years. Have you seen 0.14 announcement? Shitload of scaling improvements again. That happens every few months. SegWit is only a tiny part of that (and I don't mean to belittle it).


I think you need to rethink some definitions and separate some things that you all call "bitcoin" at the moment.
The word protocol already points to this: if there's a system X but you are not speaking the same protocol as the rest of X, then you're not using X at all. You may be curing cancer, but the system doesn't care and doesn't know, cause you're not talking to that system. That's not because someone says so, that's just a natural consequence.
If you don't speak TCP (the protocol) strictly like the protocol specifies then you can be the greatest guy in the world, but my web server is not going to reply to you. You can call the protocol that you're using TCP (the label) all day long, but my server will just drop your packets. Blame whoever you want, but that's just how the universe works. And you can bribe the TCP people to label your protocol officially TCP, but my web server will still ignore you. You need me (not some random majority) to comply or you'll never get to see my awesome content. Not my problem.
Some protocols can be created very flexibly and forgiving so that you can still communicate a little bit. Maybe like HTML, although that quickly becomes a useless mess and limiting by itself.
But it just so happens that consensus based protocols by their very nature are much more difficult and strict. Core has been working hard to make things more flexible where applicable (SegWit does that too), but some rules (like 21 million) are the whole purpose of the system, so they won't change.
Nothing of this restricts your freedom to start using Litecoin or create your own coin. And even your right to claim the label is "Bitcoin". But communication with other people requires agreeing upon a set of rules. Bitcoin is now the biggest and most useful for financial communication.
Another thing: "value" is something very meta. Value is not stored on the blockchain. Value is not in bits or bytes at all. Value is only in people's heads. Value can evaporate without a single bit of data going in or out of the blockchain. You can copy/split/fork the blockchain and get a majority of miners to mine your version, that does not mean people will agree that the value also moved to your version.
And empowering people to realize that fact is extremely important: the fact that they have the power to decide where the value is and they don't need to be dumb sheep following some populist leader. It's ethically important (stop being slave to a faraoh) but also important for the preservation of my own wealth: if others in Bitcoin just walk off tomorrow to work on a new pyramid, then my value evaporates too. The value that my 1 BTC has for me is a balance between sell today for $1200 or assume it will be worth similar or more tomorrow. If I don't trust that someone will be there tomorrow then the value evaporated.


Not sure what changes you're referring to. SegWit? SegWit is completely backwards compatible and it's perfectly fine if not everyone updates. If nobody updates then it's not a problem either, then people apparently don't want it (see first sentence again) but as soon as 1 person updates his transactions become smaller (less weight) so that makes room for other transactions. So even people that don't update at all still benefit!


SegWit is not a sidechain and not sure what ZKP have to do with it. Extension blocks is possible indeed similar to what SegWit does. But before that much more scaling is already in the pipeline. But once it becomes a no-brainer to do a hard fork, then it might become uncontentious and then there's no problem. Today it's a no-brainer NOT to do a hard fork.


Again: one person moves off the main block onto the extension block means free space for the others remaining. Maybe not as much benefits as the person that does move, but what magical update where you refuse to update gives you all the benefits without updating?




Context. Yes. Best case you stay in consensus with everybody else and nothing happens, and you wasted your time installing an incompatible client. Once your client does only the slightest thing wrong, you're off the network and not getting access to my web server anymore. If that's intentional then it's just a hard fork and the whole thing was just a nefarious hard fork attempt from the start. You should just have called it that from the start and do a proper flag date or threshold through a BIP. If it was accidental it means you're now on a chain split that is about to be orphaned and a lot of people have lost money.


SegWit does all that already. BU explicitly does NOT do any of that.


First you want choice, but then you want to force your views onto Bitcoin? You have the choice to go to an altcoin.
I prefer Bitcoin to grow, evolve and win. And my money says it will or I lose my money. What more can I do to prove it?
Once you understand Bitcoin deep enough and on a technical level, you appreciate the scientific method, you quickly realize that BU are a bunch of bozos that don't have the first clue about what Bitcoin is, how it works, what's technically possible and what lies they're telling to sell their flawed ideas. You also very quickly observe the complete inadequacy of their so called devs, who can't seem to be able to produce a line of code without bugs and security holes. That's enough to know that that's NOT the way to go for sure. Even without actually going into the details.


Most people have. But under the assumption that it would be done safely. SegWit proves that and does that.


Funny that you mention that. It was actually the promises that were false. The promises were free transactions for 10 billion people for every second of wifi usage. People with a brain quickly realized that wasn't going to work, but still invested. People without a brain invested and are today the cause of this whole problem: they're still demanding what was obviously a lie to begin with. Ver was one of the first and biggest of those liars.


It's not that I ask it. It's a logical consequence. See above.
If BU becomes Bitcoin tomorrow and there's any way I could have known that in advance, I (and many others) would never have bought a single Bitcoin and the Bitcoin price would have been that much lower. No stability and accountability -&gt; no investments.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:23:38


is what you call the blocks that old nodes see (but nobody else, at 95% and shrinking) ? That's a pretty shitty name, because today those blocks DO include witness stuff too and they will continue to do so as long as there's at least one non-segwit transaction in a block. And since SegWit is perfectly backward compatible that might be a 100 years from now assuming no hard fork that invalidates those old transaction types.
You're not very clear with what you mean, are you? Maybe that's why people are confusing what you say for FUD.
You can call it semantics, but a lot of details are actually important. That's one of the reasons we're in this shit debate in the first place: misinformation campaigns that are confusing the hell out of already complex issues.

Who says the total remains 100?

Block size limit: may have been temporary, at least that's what a lot of people claim. Not sure if that's true. It was done to close immediate DDOS vulnerabilities. Those have basically not been fixed and even further problems have been identified. It may be impossible to ever completely fix them, which is why growth is currently hard. Luckily very smart and hard working people have worked on scalability a lot over the years, improving overall efficiency and conditions for growth. 1.75MB limit is now en route and more will come. In hindsight we can definitely confirm that allowing unlimited blocks was an error by Satoshi as well.
Also a caching solution has been invented that will allow for example only 1 in 1000 or even more transactions to actually hit the blockchain, while giving full security, better anonymity and even instant transactions. That's true scaling.
Configured to unlimited or 1MB is a mere setting, but the design has inherent limits in it whether Satoshi realized them or not. 10 minutes has proven to be a pretty good choice. How much data can be handled in that time (or actually the few seconds after a new block is found) is simply a function of hardware and software efficiency and capacities, while constrained by the requirement to keep Bitcoin decentralized.

As long as changes (good or bad) to the system are possible, any investor will see that as a risk. Maybe one day it will change not in his favour and he loses money.
If bitcoin continually proves to be not changing no matter what kinds of political games are played, then it can establish itself as a rock solid system. Growing more solid with time and every thwarted attack. That on itself is valuable.


A contentious hard fork is. Pretty much by definition. If you invest in bitcoin and then end up in the up to 49% that gets screwed over by rules changing from under them, you're pissed off and divest. If you ended up pro hard fork you should still be pissed off because you should realise that while this time it was a change in your favour, next time you might be the one to get screwed over, so you divest. Not rock solid. Not reliable.
Contentious soft forks on the other hand may be fine (if not outright evil). Soft forks stay within the rules that Satoshi set out, so everybody already agreed to them beforehand when they invested. Nobody gets screwed over.


SegWit definitely is. I'm very pro SegWit. I hate Ver and his political propaganda machine obstructing it.

Of course 2 chains won't last more than days or weeks. But for economic reasons and maybe because of 51% attscks. Not for technical reasons per se.


That sentence doesn't make sense, but it doesn't look like a typo. So clearly you don't understand what happens at a chain fork.
2 coins that are not on the same chain cannot be on the same chain. The moment the fork happens all coins are duplicated. Each chain has all coins, but from then on they can not move from one chain to another anymore. The only thing that can happen is that you make a transaction for one chain and maybe that transaction is valid in the other chain two so both coins get moved in both chains, maybe.
Both chains are altcoins of each other. The bloody all-destroying war that ensues will be over which one gets to be called bitcoin.

Makes a lot of sense to introduce a BIP when the time is right and consensus has a decent chance instead of pointless bikeshedding and pretending BIPs are political pamphlets that we see now.

I can't take any credit. I try to answer questions (only the ones that I feel qualified to answer) and I help out at some meetups, but that's it.
I'm simply in awe of the rocket scientists that took us to the moon. I have an above average understanding of the intricacies involved, which allows me to see the beauty even better. I'm however nowhere near the level of those rocket scientists themselves.
I am completely and utterly pissed off at the unfair treatment these people are getting for not delivering the impossible, pronto. Especially since it's coming from people that can't do anything themselves and can't manage to put two sentences down that are not riddled with inaccuracies or complete lies.
I'm sorry if I can't stand dumb people. I'm dumb myself in 99% of other fields of life, but I don't claim otherwise and in those contexts I try to shut up.

Have you actually seen the video as well? Notice the tone of his voice and the way he's presenting this calculation? Obviously it's a big handwaving extremely rough estimate napkin calculation.
And you know what? If he'd do the same calculation today he'd actually come to half or less of that total number, thanks to numerous efficiency improvements that have come up since that first day it was announced.
So that would be open/closing a channel every 3 months.
It's still the same ballpark napkin hypothetical universal adoption distant future world domination scenario calculation, but hopefully 3 months instead of 6 makes you feel a little better.

@_date: 2016-03-19 02:12:51
You got it wrong. Miners are employed by the economic actors, they work in the service of the network. If they fuck up they can get fired. You can certainly not let them have control over the protocol. Ready example to see that: 21milion is an easy change that all miners would vote for.
As stakeholders of bitcoins they are welcome to voice their opinions as any other stakeholder. As miners they need to do as told.
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:23:36


The delay: if this is going with minority hash power the difficulty readjustment time will be at least 4 weeks. Allowing 5% extra hash power to help saves about 1.5 days. As well as taking away that hash power from the opposing chain.
The simplest implementation would be to just start rejecting blocks after 5% of 2016 has already been mined. That's just picking the correct block nr as flag day.
But it would be nicer to get 1 SegWit block and then allow the 5% non SegWit blocks on top. Those block rewards are direct inventive for their miners to switch to SW or lose that reward. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:26:52
Don't you think we've drifted far enough from the context and the original point.

@_date: 2017-03-20 18:52:25


You didn't sound like it, but maybe that's my warrior mode blinding me.


Well, then even mentioning 2/4/8 doesn't make much sense. But again, SegWit + updates + one doubling will already go past 2/4/8 anyway, so in capacitty terms there's not even really a difference. And 2/4/8 was like at least 1 year between doublings? Then the SegWit route still has a chance of being there sooner, but if not, at least we'll have 4x in the pocket.


With the caveat that the max is unlikely and costly for the attacker (and prunable for low effect) and easily defended against by soft forking in some restriction or even by other miners re-orging any blocks with for example wittness size &gt;  2x base size (for max 3MB blocks) or some other trick like that.


But even 2MB will give us 8x, so that's fine worst case. With the above point added in, 3MB certainly does become possible and that's 12x so a lot more than 2/4/8 ever intended.


I was still counting SegWit as 2MB  when I typed that, later fixed that to 2.3MB.
Anyway, you're still not giving any new arguments (nor valid old ones) that counter anything I said or support what you said.
Now if you want to discuss the likelihood of any such block size increase happening at all, then that's a different story. First of all, nobody can predict or promise that, not even a road map by the devs. That's the nature of a decentralized system as well as a result of many unknowns that can still change over the years. SegWit is a nice experiment and small step that is already teaching us a shitload today even before it's activated. Apparently politics and corruption has already crept in even deeper into the Bitcoin system than anybody would have guessed. That's clearly blocking progress and might stall or block any further increase. It's not like 2/4/8 was any more likely to ever happen, so comparing it to that is pointless. And all of this certainly can't be blamed on the Core devs.

Huh? How does that do anything if not confirm my statement?
He was irrelevant in Bitcoin, so he started his own software fork. He hasn't been active for bitcoin anymore since. Then Gavin wanted to start a chain fork so they hooked up with him and they rebuilt it into the attack platform to hard fork the blockchain. Luckily it failed because in the nick of time people started to realise that blocks too big is actually dangerous.
After that poor choice on Gavin's part he doesn't admit anything, instead he puts his trust in some random nobody (jtoomim) without a single day of Bitcoin development experience (let alone any indication that he has the deep insight needed to reason about consensus and blockchains, quite the opposite actually).

@_date: 2016-03-24 02:36:57
Hmmm something wrong with reddit, don't see your post in context anymore.
Anyway, what you quoted perfectly confirms what i said:


Slightly changing the word order a bit and dropping some words, this says:
A block has to be valid (implies there are rules that determine what is valid) and then a miner can chose to **express acceptance** (vote) by building on top of it. Invalid blocks can't be voted on, only **rejected**. That process **enforces** the rules.
Again: nowhere does that say where the rules themselves come from or where they are defined or that they can be changed at all. Especially not with the voting mechanism described here.
The beautiful trick here is that it's a bit of a circular self-reenforcing mechanism: we have rules that determine valid or invalid (ultimately which coin is worth something and which isn't). On the face of it those rules don't carry any weight and are quite arbitrary: "Who cares what some random satoshi dude said so many years ago? I'll just make my own rules."
But simply applying (enforcing) the true rules (and especially rejecting anything that does not follow those rules) makes those rules become empowered. It gives meaning or value or trust or weight to those rules. And empowered rules are worth following because everyone knows others are following those same rules as opposed to some other random rules. The longer this cycle runs with more users and capital and miners and electricity, the more value/trust is captured within it.
Breaking this self reenforcing cycle by suddenly changing the rules destroys much of the value/trust that those rules have, which the new rules will have to regain. How much is lost and how long it will take to regain very much depend on the specifics of the rule change and the context/political atmosphere in which it happens. Ideally everyone agrees to the rule change and everyone just switches, then the cycle can just keep cycling as if nothing happened.
Maybe it's like a jet engine spinning up: as it turns faster it sucks in more air so it can burn more fuel and spin even faster. And a rule change is like having to swap out a few blades on the fan: how do you do that without spinning down the engine?
Not sure I'm still on topic.
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:06:06
Apart from other answers: it also allows chaining unspent transactions. Imagine an exchange having to do thousands of payouts every day. They better have a reserve of confirmed unspent transactions outputs to be used in payouts. Once used, they can't safely use the change from the first payout in the next one without waiting for confirmations (because of malleability).
All that generating confirmed transaction outputs and juggling them around creates a lot of unnecessary and larger transactions (as well as dust if not done correctly) than would be required if you can just take one 100BTC txoutput, make a payment, use the change for the next payment and the next without waiting for confirmations.
Minor advantage compared to the others probably, but still a real improvement in the efficiency of using the Bitcoin system, as well as a leap in ease of development (safer / less bugs) of such a payout system.

No it didn't work perfectly. Mining almost centralized completely and nodes stopped in droves. Only through the hard work of Core devs did they manage to increase efficiency enough to keep Bitcoin barely running at all.
1) "real" betrays your dishonesty. SegWit really increases the block size. Anything else you're trying to imply is bullshit.
2) Yeah, Core did that. So? 
3) That's a complete nonsense solution. Something scales quadratically so we'll just throw quadratically more CPU power against it? While a solution that removes the problem completely by making it linear is available? WTF?

No worries :)
It's like I hear myself talking. I agree with all of that.
Miners: Just spend as much electricity as we pay you in fees (and block reward), that's enough. We don't need you to do huge multi year investments set on grabbing as much market share as possible, driving out competition and squeezing out every percentage point of efficiency by consolidating into huge pools. We pay you for decentralized-PoW. Centralization by definition reduces the value of your product and makes us less interested in it. If the value of your product is reduced too far, we will shop for a better product elsewhere.
I wish it were possible to do a PoW reset regularly. The current long term incentives for miners to play fair are fairly weak because there's such cut-throat competition that any miners not optimizing for short term gain is risking not to exist long enough for the long term to matter (at least for their bussiness, if they're hodling that a different story). (Solution: make part of the block reward only spendable after X years? Force them to hodle?)
But a regular PoW reset creates a huge centralization on itself: who decides when and more importantly what the new PoW algo will be? (Huge opportunities for bribes and front running.) And any deterministic predictable change in PoW can be anticipated and built into any ASIC and is thus pointless.

That's why smart devs have come up and perfected over the years the skill of updating using soft forks. Soft forks in general are much much safer and more democratic as people can choose not to update without bitcoin tearing to shreds. Soon it will be posdible to have multiple soft forks "in flight" at the same time. Huge dev speed increase as well as true choice for users.
Also once stuff had calmed down, it's quite likely that a non-contentious hard fork to raise the limit can be done. Non-contentious makes it a whole different story and can be (again assuming important caveat non-contentious) quite easy and smooth.

@_date: 2017-03-25 23:29:53


Doesn't assume that at all. Best case for everybody is if no miner ever does that.


No the hope is that if some evil thieving miners try to steal money that enough neutral miners stay neutral and continue on the most work chain. That's a lower bar than your scenario.


Only the anti-segwit side. The neutral non-segwit miners have nothing to fear and will be just fine. Again lower bar, less disruption and no force (opt-in) involved.
With UASW miners can choose to be in one of the camps: SegWit, non-segwit (status quo) or anti-segwit. That last camp will actively try to steal money, attack the most work chain, censor transactions and force reorgs. Basically 51% attacking bitcoin (not just SegWit).


Absolutely. I haven't made my mind up about UASW at all yet.

Some exchanges actually will. If a hard fork just happened, a lot of them aren't prepared or have already said they'd just follow the miners.

Then you're definitely on the wrong side. BU are literally raping Satoshi's white paper. Giving miners more power and trust is three death of Bitcoin and certainly not Satoshi's vision. Nor is blindly raising the block size.
You're wasting your time with those incompetent morons. Even incentive from all the incentive fuckery, they haven't released a single update not riddled with security holes and bugs. Untested. Not peer reviewed. Overblown (lied) claims on how great it is and then best case a few updates later it's silently completely removed again.

Sigh. Where to start?


Bitcoin was built to be safe up to a 51% attack, but now we just ignore a 30% attack?
Doesn't need to be 1 miner, can be a few colluding with one simple agreement that is hugely profitable to all of them, with nothing to gain from backstabbing each other.
Who gives a fuck what you or I " believe" a miner to do? Bitcoin is about being secure and safe and careful: you prove that no miner will ever possibly do it or the change doesn't happen. Period.
But your solution is "handwave, don't worry, if we ignore reason it will all be fine".


The point is that we are, yes. Rigid as fuck, changeable only if everyone agrees out those that are against it can completely ignore it without down sides (i.e. proper soft forks).


Doesn't exist. There no such thing. Miners deterministically come to consensus on the order of transactions. That's it. That's what the blockchain is for. That's the only thing remotely like voting surviving to blockchains: voting what the transaction order is.


Riiiight... And that's decided by a committee? A committee that votes to make it democratic I'm sure? I bet Satoshi gets an honourary seat, right?
Can you spell decentralised?


OMG /facepalm, WTF? you got to be kidding me!
D E C E N T R A L I S E D


No you can't. Miners are anonymous. A fundamental requirement for Bitcoin to work at all.


Why would they? They're getting double the income and they get to teach the dumb miners studying with the attackers a perfect lesson: "fuck with bitcoin and you get burned bad!" I'd join those miners and fully support them.


No you can't. None of that is possible. Miners are anonymous + more reasons. Besides the moment any of that would be required, the bitcoin experiment has failed and you can just give up and go back to paypal. Game over indeed.
Also: it's not those miners that are acting in a terrible way, it's the miners that initiate a contentious hard fork that are acting terribly and deserve to be punished.


First of all, i don't buy handwaving "nothing to see here, don't worry everything will be fine" bull shit. Especially if i just gave you an easy guaranteed easy money for a 30% attack. Again: you have to prove that 25% will follow and no bad things can happen, otherwise you can fuck off with your change. Hint: assuming by wishful thinking does not equal proving.


After missing out on how many block rewards? 1 day? A week? 2 weeks? 
And yeah flip flopping, that's going to look really trustworthy to users and investors...


Again wishful thinking false assumptions.


Yeah sure, go take some random gambles with a $10billion airplane in mid flight. See what happens. And thanks from all the unknowing people that got scammed and double spent during the time there were 2 chains. And thanks for undermining the security of the whole network and both chains, making the whole shit vulnerable to outside attack. And thanks for making 6 confirmations meaningless, from now on we'll have to wait 60 confirmations and read every reddit article to be sure we're not getting screwed.
Tip: get your head out of that classic cesspool, they infect your brain with bullshit. Don't say anything for a year while you learn how things actually work and you enjoy the amazing new features and enhancements that Core brings, as well as dive deeper into the amazing rabbit holes that Bitcoins had to offer. See you in a year.

Why then is he wasting his time on NOT "all of the above" but on unrelated, unasked for, adviced against, obsolete from the start and dangerous ideas like head-first mining?
@_date: 2016-03-17 17:19:01


Of course anyone would agree with that, but the thing with this sort of security is that you really want to have as large a margin as possible. For example if an attacker can attack 1000 people at once with each 3/1000th of the block reward, then your example turns out quite differently.
Anything that decreases that margin, even by a little, needs to be well considered, discussed and peer-reviewed. It's highly likely that better options exist that don't (or to a lesser extent) decrease security.
Regarding light clients, I think it's hard to judge right now because there's pretty much only one type of light client at the moment (other than mycelium and electrum that run (modified) full nodes in the background). Pretty much anything light client today are Android/IPhone wallets built on bitcoinj (or similar) library. Often called SPV clients, although that's not really the correct term.
Core is slowly working towards better (more secure) and different types of light clients. Pruning is part of that. SegWit will enable Fraud Proofs which also play into that goal. Within one or two years we'll be running wallets on our phones that are for as secure as Full Nodes, but of course don't process full blocks. And on your Raspberry Pi 4 in your mom's basement you'll be running a Light Node which is basically a Full Node except massive pruning and less bandwidth and disk I/O. Miners will be running nodes that are more block latency optimized. Different choices for different requirements and capabilities.
An ad-hoc, not well thought through, quick patch right now should not be a road block later on for much cooler things. Another  reason why proper dicussion, peer review and weighing of the different options is necessary. Gavin already rushed P2SH too quickly a few years ago without enough consideration for an actually superior proposal.


True. Although as long as the reward is non zero, it's still more than wasting cycles on a certain loss.


I doubt it will be trivial actually. If you only have the header then you don't know how many transactions are in it. So you'd have to include a counter in the header. Then remember if you in any way punish or cause a disadvantage to a miner for making an empty block, he will simply make a few dummy transactions and put those in the block instead. Then you're fucked even more because you get useless blocks, but you don't even know it anymore.
Also allowing one empty block but then not another one on top of it: then you're just back to the current situation: what else is the miner going to mine on? By then he really doesn't have any choice anymore but just to keep building another empty block.
I think you could only solve this on the client side by simply not counting empty blocks as a confirmation unless there's a non-empty block behind it. But again: with only the header you don't know if the block is empty or not and you'd have to trust the miners not to put dummy transaction in there.

1. He was definitely supporting it behind the scenes before going for it full out. He gambled on segwit2x for a while and when that was obviously a dead end he switched to bcash. He had also always been pushing for the bcash precursors XT and unlimited and whatever other histile takeover attempts we've seen over the years. So saying his dirty scammer hands were in it from the start is probably not far from the truth.
2. It's bullshit. They claim segwit is bad, but in contexts where they really can't deny their own internal contradictions anymore they suddenly say they'll fix malleability but of course not through segwit becauae that's bad but through something else which then turns out to be half ass (bad) fixes to parts of the problem but in no way a full solution. So no your original assessment was correct. They just dangle some carrots out there to keep the sheep thinking theytworking on so.ethig and everything will be fixed soon but in reality nothing but buggy nonsense happens.

Core is not a centralized power structure. You are free to hire your own experts and have them introduce BIPS. No they will not take suggestions from idiots, you do need experts. If you don't require influence you can simply verify what they're doing through the normal open source means. 
To make that process easier and smoother, they are also working hard on making the development process itself democratic, whereby anyone can introduce new features and the market can decide which ones they like simply by using those and not using the ones they don't like. Without having to do community splitting, market trashing, mob rule hard forks for every little step.

It took 5 decades of many smart people creating small building blocks and eventually one smart guy to align them all together to get system. And then another 8 years of a team of world class experts to correct and fine tune that alignment to get us where we are now. (Far from perfect and arguably not delivering on its decentralization promise at all anymore, which would mean complete failure.)
This stuff didn't just overnight become simple enough for amateurs to come along and claim to have a better solution.

Built into core or not doesn't really mean much. Look at it like an add-on. Its target audience is only a subset of Core users: those that care most about latency, i.e. miners. Other users can be better helped by a solution that minimises bandwidth for example.
Matt kept it out of core so far on purpose so that it was much easier to develop and roll out independent of core releases.

No, by that definition any random idiot that shouts I want X, creates unresolved contention. Fact is that resilience against change is good for stability. SegWit not activating is indeed bad in many aspects, including the price. But Bitcoin keeps chugging along unaffected. Not improved, but not scarred either.
Only 100% uncontentious hard forks are good. Otherwise they're attacks by definition and create a split off altcoin that results in extreme messy shit, certain to dump the price.
I'm not against the necessary change. But I have no doubt SegWit will activate soon anyway, so I'm all fine.

Do they need to? Your end goal should be that all those miners run their own Full Node and not simply work on templates provided by someone else, right? Otherwise they're still not decentralized.
Maybe the coinbase transaction should be something that can trustlessly be split up after the fact? Maybe through Lightning like payments that build on the coinbase transaction?
Suppose I start mining a block that pays out to a payment channel open transaction (with proper locktime etc.). Then I offer anybody who gives me a share paying to that same contract a signed micropayment transaction valid for that payment channel. If necessary, As soon as anyone who joined me finds the block, all those micropayments automatically become worth a share of the block reward, to be unlocked after the 100 blocks waiting time. To prevent all those micropayments from becoming dust on the blockchain, participants can then use LN to trade those shares for LN payments.
I'm skipping over a lot of problems here. For one that the miners probably still need to coordinate on which transactions to mine. But anyway, that's the direction I'm always thinking of when thinking about decentralized mining pools.
I've read your post a bit further, but it's quite confusing to me. Not sure yet what you're getting at yet. I'll have to finish reading it later.

The random value will likely be used as "even" or "odd" or a 1 in 10 chance or maybe modulo 100. But how many options do you really need? Even skipping one or a few blocks massively influences the chances of "disliked" numbers coming up.

Core is many dozens to more than a hundred people, depending on who you count (not everybody needs to be a dev. Designers, thinkers, reviewers, documenters are also required).
I don't have a list handy, but it gets posted regularly (often in response to someone repeating the lie "Core == Blockstream"). You'll run into one soon enough.
Another point is that Blockstream is simply a company founded by a few Core people. They were already Core (even before that name was invented, they were Bitcoin developers/researchers). They were mostly unfunded volunteer open source developers. Then they decided to form a company and get some investment money, so at least they'd have some food on the table and would be able to dedicate their full time to Bitcoin.


There's no such thing as one person holding the key to everything and his boss being able to tell him what to do. In the physical universe we live in, yes at some point one person has to do something to take the ultimate step. But he has all other Core people as well as the rest of the community watching over his shoulders. He doesn't have wiggle room or opportunity to do evil, and processes and procedures are explicitly geared toward that goal with a big safety margin to take away any doubt.

I think you replied to the wrong post. But i agree for sure. Although SegWit actually has the benefit that it's not an instant increase, it will take at least a couple of weeks/months before we'll see consistently &gt; 2MB blocks, i think.

So the only solution is to make Bitcoin immune to political flipflopping and populism is by cementing a stable and rigid set of rules that can only change through many small soft forks (using version bits) where the actual users (not the shills and not the miners) get to vote by using the new features. And certainly not allow any contentious hard fork to ever take place. Even leaving the possibility of ever doing a contentious hard fork is like inviting the populists to come give it a shot. Slam that door shut in their face right now and we might not have them come back for a little while and when done enough times maybe they'll stop trying altogether.

Good. Then he can't ever.
Go tell him that he might as well stop today. He's not getting a Hard Fork before SegWit + Schnorr + SA + MAST are all rolled out (and never as long as it's anything like BU style bullshit).
That's already past 6MB equivalent, so that should give his pawns some time to come up with a real honest Hard Fork proposal. If it's a good proposal I'm sure it will be uncontentious.

Yeah, but in a sane soft fork, we're talking about behavior that no sane person has ever even tried to do. If the USA covers the whole space of all possible transactions, then what is in use today is only as large as a childrens playground in New York city. SegWit is like opening up another playground in Los Angelos. Nobody before SegWit had any use or business or reason to be being outside of New York, let alone that particular playground on the other side of the country.
So you're saying that an old chain that "continues" fucking around on the playground in Los Angelos will get forked off.
This analogy also shows why SegWit prefers to have a majority hash rate supporting it is: in case the old New York miners purposely sends their gangsters to LA to do nefarious things on the new playground (that's the moment a new chain can start), then it's nice to be backed by hashing power that kicks those gangsters out.
But it also shows what a Soft Fork (SegWit) wants from the old system: "We found this little piece of dirt far far away and we'd like to play there. Of course we'll still follow all the rules that Satoshi set out. Just leave us in peace and don't attack us and everything will be just fine. We won't force you to move over, you can stay in New York if you like, but we suspect you'll see, once we've tested everything, this new spot is a lot nicer.".
AS opposed to an uncontentious hard fork which is like all of us packing up our shit in New York, abandon that playground completely and then all together in one instant move to LA and continue there.
Problematic chains can form there when some stragglers were not paying attention and are playing on their own in New York, or worse when some significant portion of people simply refuse to move at all.


I've discussed that exact same thing just a few days ago with someone else. First of all that example is absolutely nothing like SegWit. It's very contrived and a useless soft fork. So all that example proves (if we agree it's a soft fork at all) is that soft forks can be dumb and possibly even evil. Well, humans can do stupid shit and blow up the planet. Bitcoin users will always have to be vigilant against attacks.
You could also argue that your example is not really a soft fork anyway. You're basically operating outside the assumptions Satoshi set for a working system. You might be running Litecoin or invent your own coin or "soft fork" yourself onto your own chain but it's all equally irrelevant.

SegWit IS a blocksize increase. More than the increase that was on demand at the time it was announced. And HF or change with the goal of increasing the blocksize in any other way than SegWit is pure braindead.
Making two low level changes to the system at the same time is just braindead. This the worlds most delicate dynamic balancing act of incentives and human assholes puling from all sides. A system which nobody fully understands or can model yet. You don't fuck with such a system by turning multiple knobs and hope for the best. Part of dialing any knob is the experiment that shows what happens.
PoW reset is a whole different story. Bitcoin is not decentralized at the moment and is clearly being hijacked by Ver &amp; Juhan. Bitcoin without decentralization is worthless. Users have the power to say "fuck you" to them by running full nodes and ultimately with the threat of a PoW reset. That's why Ver is working very hard to undermine that power by making users believe they don't have that power ("hashpower decides!") and by altering the system to take that power away from users under false pretenses ("We'll give you these shiny knobs to turn and you can set the block size yourself."). History is full of dictators that came to power by promising people golden rainbows and partition their opposition to get elected.
The defense against centralization is 1000x more important than anything having to do with blocksize. It's a matter of Bitcoin continues to exist and improve slowly (and SegWit and following improvements are actually still in a mind blowing high speed), or it stops existing entirely.

No previous well planned hardforks exists. Not even worked out plans for them.
However, Core devs are continuing their work on improving hard fork suggestions and ideas on making them safer and better. They're working towards a hard fork as mentioned in the roadmap of more than a year ago. There's absolutely no point in doing a hard fork today though. SegWit and further improvements already in the pipeline do much smarter and more effective things already.


Well observed and described. Exactly right.
Everybody wishes things would go faster, but all agree that taking shortcuts that screw decentralization are out of the question.
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:56:48
Agreed. I'll pay extra attention.
I must add that i do think that we're currently in the quite uncomfortable zone wrt decentralisation.
I do have a bit of hope that once the unbelievable growth in hash power finally really levels off, that then smaller miners without the direct supply chain of the latest and greatest ASIC chips straight from the factories, will get a bit better chance again. Currently small people are simply buying equipment that will never pay off anymore by the time they get shipped. I've tried and it's easy to calculate. Only at scale with the right factory connections do you stand a chance at profit.
A more level hash rate growth should create a bit more of a level playing field. Just hope it's not too late by then (undoing centralisation is probably harder than letting it grow).
Maybe around the upcoming halving...

1: The reason the block size can NOT grow too much and too quickly IS technical. The reason people WANT it to grow is emotional and $ eyes, or economical at best.

@_date: 2017-03-30 16:07:34


That's because it's not just about the nodes. I can start 100 nodes myself on different IP addresses all around the world, but that means nothing.
It's about Users, actual users. Economic nodes. And yes, it's impossible to count them or hold an honest fair vote amongst them. That's what makes this stuff so hard and why SegWit was using 95% hashing power as threshold. It was hoped that would be an indication of readiness (and thus a safe moment to upgrade). Consensus among users was always the most important factor though, and that is overwhelming already.
So what's a user? Someone buying or selling or hodling coins. Someone with a stake in the correct operation of the whole system. Economic nodes. And then we don't mean a user that just throws some money at bitcoin and doesn't care what happens with it. Those users will be blind sheep following whatever miners do, even adding 200% inflation. We're talking about users that fully check all rules and who will raise alarm bells and ignore or refuse transactions/blocks whenever a single rule violation is discovered. Those users are the guardians of the whole system, but since it's a decentralized system, it's vital that a big portion of full nodes do this work in a decentralized fashion.
Yeah sure. Miners do run those nodes too. Miners are economic users.
But miners overall will be selling a lot of coins. And not to other miners. They need buying users. If they don't get $2M per day, they'll go out of business quickly. Miners are net sellers. If there's no balance with net buyers, the price (of whatever rule-change altcoin they've created) plummets and they're screwed.


And it's the only reason why you might still argue that Bitcoin is still decentralized: clearly the mining is not, that's hopelessly centralized. And that is certainly bad. Development will never be done by an average Joe, but it's certainly not centralized today and is getting better rapidly with time. (And development also includes those that verify the code, not only those who write it.) The third part of decentralized is the fully validating users. That's the most important leg and has been plummeting rapidly since Bitcoin began. If I'm not mistaken, it's now finally getting a bit better again with more full nodes coming online, seemingly not in a sybil attack fashion. (Yet impossible to accurately count, but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence and indirect measurement opportunities.) David Vorick recently did a good talk on this: 
One of his insights was: if you don't run a full node today, but you absolutely have the intention and ability to start one up the moment an attack on the network happens, then you still count. This requires the initial block download to be reasonably quick, if such a user needs a week to get his full node online then the effect is a lot less of course.
But those users are clearly impossible to ever accurately count.

What's functional about changing two parameters at the same time? SegWit is already a block size increase. And there are updates in the pipeline that will reduce the transaction size which means more transactions for LESS risk instead of a braindead hard fork with a guaranteed split.

As soon as you're blaming ASICs, you don't get it. Everything will boil down to ASICs and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

The observation that your between ears mass is rotten from propaganda, is not an attack. The misinformation is designed to do that.
1) "base" betrays your dishonesty. SegWit really increases the block size. Anything else you're trying to imply is bullshit.
2) BU thing is garbage based on an obsolete idea.
3) While a solution that removes the problem completely by making it linear is available? WTF?
Also it doesn't do what you think it does.


4MB SegWit blocks would be a waste of money for miners and pretty a dumb attack. That is they won't happen in any meaningful number. Which means it's completely different from a 4MB block consistently full with transactions. Meaning your comparison is again dishonest, bull shit and glaring pointer to your non understanding.

@_date: 2017-03-20 19:38:01
Welcome to reddit. Let me assure you that 3 months is not enough to grasp Bitcoin. Even 3 years isn't for anyone but the smartest. So don't feel bad about being mistaken.
Your SW A is impossible because the block size increase is a direct result of the discount. If the discount is smaller, the maximum block size is smaller. If the discount was higher then the maximum block size would have been for example 5MB. So there's your first lack of understanding.
Next point is that there is no such thing as a 75% fee discount. Nobody determines the fee or what discount is applied, other than a supply and demand market where miners can have a little bit of influence by mining non-full blocks (at their own expense). Also: the most recent estimates are that SegWit will give ~2.3MB blocks. 1 and 2.3. There's no way you can devise a 75% out of those 2 numbers, even if the math would work that way. So again: 75% is NOT applied to the fees. Second misunderstanding.
Fact is SegWit will allow the supply of block space to go up gradually. Yes fees will likely go down because of that, but that's more than made up by the fact that blocks can contain more than double the number of transactions resulting in a higher total fee sum.
Third point is that maximum blocksize doesn't mean anything anymore with SegWit. The correct metric to use is maximum block weight. And weight is not in bytes. It's just a number. The maximum for that number is 4million.
The idea behind SegWit is that not all bytes have an equal weight. Otherwise we'd arrive at your SW A, which is pointless.
SegWit weighs all bytes in the signatures as 1 each and all non-signature bytes as 4. So the average weight of each byte is between 1 and 4. 4 means the transaction is not using SegWit at all. An average weight of 1 is actually impossible since all transactions have at least a few non-signature bytes. So the extreme would be 1 transaction with ~3.9 MB of signatures. Which is silly and clearly a useless (and costly) spam attack (side note).
So indeed miners do not care about the fee per byte, they care about the fee per weight point. Because that's the metric that determines how much total fee they receive.
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:44:45
Agree. Except problem only in this context. Exactly what's needed in the decentralized context.


And the funny thing is that all are perfectly valid, even together if they were said by one person (which I'm pretty sure they have been). No contradiction. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:01:28


And that's exactly why centralized mining is such a problem and also exactly why we are not letting you vote on anything or giving you even more power like the BU retards want to do. Bitcoin is dead when that happens so you better not wish for it either.
@_date: 2016-03-31 12:21:56
Wrong again. First of all 75% is not "large amounts of support". It contentious and it means 25% are getting butfucked.
Also: it opens up a beautifully simple attack where 30% of the hashing power can fake support for classic, helping it over 75% and then immediately switch back to never mine a single classic block. That means 45% of the network is wasting their time on classic blocks which keep getting overtaken by the 55% Bitcoin blocks. Almost doubling the income for all Bitcoin miners ( = free pure profit).


The above shows that it can already happen with 45% "real support". Add to that the deceitful way that the classic trigger is implemented and it can easily be (i.e. is likely to be) even 5% lower due to variance/luck.
But you're right. I'm not worried classic will even get 25% support, so Bitcoin will survive another round of vicious attacks and come out stronger.

Not just unreasonable, completely idiotic. SegWit already gives more than that.
And no, they won't go away, because they've already proven that this whole nonsense is not about the blocksize at all: it's about grabbing and centralizing power around Ver &amp; co. They don't give a crap about blocksize, other than to push out even more miners and centralize further.
@_date: 2016-01-28 11:02:14


It's not just the ability for multiple people to run a node. There are other problems that have a much lower threshold. And even then it's not about any particular node: it's about the network as a whole being healthy.
Just running a full node with 32MB blocks is actually relatively easy with a decent internet connection, big harddisk and decently powerful CPU. I doubt many people would have enough insentives to do so however, because at that level Bitcoin would be dead and just be a bad version of Paypal.

When you think about it it makes perfect sense for such an illusion to form. Here is a group of smart experts with decades of experience and formal scientific training. They do their best to seriously look at any ideas that come up (i regularly see them discuss things on IRC in the wizards channel). But it should be blindingly obvious that 99.9% of the ideas that come their way are the same or variations of the same. Add to the fact that bitcoin has sides that seem really easy to understand on the surface but are immensely complex only one later deeper, and you can easily imagine them being drowned in ideas.
At some point their answers are going to get shorter or become absent. That will give the impression of disrespect and elitism and whatever else you want to read in it. But it's just a natural progression that needs no conspiracy theories.
You can also flip your viewpoint around and say: the devs are offering their limited time and expertise to the public free of charge to do peer review of their ideas. Because of overwhelming response they've had to increase the quality requirements, just like any scientific paper would or in fact anyone with a full mailbox.
If you haven't taken at least a little bit of time to understand the basics of bitcoin and at do a minimal effort to see if your ideas has already come up before. That doesn't show much respect for valuable reviewer's time time.

"Choices" is a load of crock that is meant to sound nice when uttered by politicians, but it doesn't mean anything. Bitcoin simply doesn't work like that.
Sure, you have plenty of choices. You can enable RBF or not, you can choose to change the minrelayfee and more of that sort of policy decisions. You can even decide to mine smaller blocks than the limit.
But consensus changes need to be done by everyone at the same time, which is dishonest and dangerous to do if not done in a friendly non-contentious manner.
And don't confuse "consensus" about the longest valid chain (that's what Bitcoin does) with "consensus" on what software to run (that's not what Bitcoin does, that's what BIPS are for). They are different contexts of "consensus" and are determined using different methods.

Using their connection to rescue their own investment at the expense of other people's investments (MtGox is solvent, trust me, everything's fine), Keeping their followers stupid with lies, propaganda and suppression of the truth by taking over media, forums and communication channels (setting up his own claiming to be the authority while sending trolls to drown out existing channels).

Which they don't have time for anymore so that's going to be a untested contentious hard fork slapped together full with vulns and rolled out in 6 weeks. Why again?

You listen to dumb people too much. They have an agenda and are spreading FUD for others to parrot. Also 75% is extremely dangerously low for hard forks.
Just to give you a hint:    and 


1) "Forcing" is what would be required by a hard fork (that's what makes it a _hard_ fork.)
2) Many new features have been put into Bitcoin over the years and clients that didn't implement them may have gone obsolete by now. Their choice, no force involved, but unavoidable if you care for new features and improvements.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:10:13


Then I can assure you it will be a fun ride. 


It's quite short (for an acadamic paper, especially this ground breaking) and well readable even to non-experts. But that doesn't mean that it isn't densely packed with important nuances and details. One famous one is the "longest chain wins". It actually says "the longest VALID chain" where it's easy to forget that "valid" is the most important condition a chain needs to fulfill and that "longest" is only second to that.
Another thing with the white paper is that it does contain errors or omissions, Satoshi was human but more importantly this was (and is) bleeding edge brand new science and tech. He couldn't have known some things. Famous example is (again the same sentence) "the longest chain". That's actually a bug causing a vulnerability which was quickly fixed in one of the early Bitcoin versions: it's not about "longest chain" it's about "most-work chain".
So today, when a node receives a new block it requires that this block is completely valid AND that it's part of the chain that has the most amount of total work in its history. This clearly means that the rules that decide validity have nothing to do with hashing power. The rules are fixed, the hashing only decides which of two equally valid alternative blocks "wins" and gets integrated into the chain. The other simply gets forgotten.
Anyway, not sure if you were already on that level, just an example about a common misunderstanding in BU circles. The white paper does say this if you read it with the right knowledge, even if it doesn't emphasize it as much (can't blame Satoshi for not foreseeing what dishonest propagandists would twist his words into 8 years later).


Be very very careful with any information you pick up from BU or rbtc. It's so full of lies and misunderstandings that even if you do find a fact, it's likely burried in the wrong context and misapplied. The example above is just that in combination with "One CPU one vote" (from white paper). In general, it's hard to say "don't listen to them" and expect to keep an open mind. But this situation is more akin scientists finding evidence for a non-flat world being heliocentric, while the kings and priests trying to keep a hold of their power and control over the ignorant sheep banning any free information that endangers their (future) position. Free thinking informed people are a danger to any central power. Add to this the 21st century internet where paid trolls can live behind endless anonymous accounts throwing shit and lies and you get rbtc.


There's a lot of debate and seemingly contradictory (or maybe change of mind) posts by Satoshi on that. Facts are he didn't allow big blocks from day one, then he imposed a strict limit (for a good reason, which hasn't been completely solved today, SegWit actually solves that (almost) all the way) and he fought people who tried to raise that limit, telling them not to do it. Another fact is that he specifically did NOT put the control over the block size in the hands of the miners. He could have easily done something in exactly the manner he did the automatic recalibration of the difficulty and the automatic halvings every 4 years. He specifically did not. Maybe because he knew that predicting the correct block size into the far future was very difficult or even impossible. Maybe he was hoping to one day come up with a solution where he could say something like "IF blah blah then max block size +10%" every difficulty adjustment period. Everybody agrees that that would be the perfect solution, but unfortunately nobody has come up with a good idea so far. Everything simple you can come up with can be gamed (mostly by miners) and is therefore not  reliable and safe. So he specifically did NOT give miners the power to control block size, not even indirectly.


Everybody is in favor of larger blocks, not just today with SegWit (which is more than 2MB) but also future increases. Even mentioned in the Core roadmap of year+ ago. The funny thing is that after SegWit a few update are in the pipeline that will reduce the transaction size, which gives probably more than another doubling of transaction capacity WITHOUT even having to increase the block size at all. So with SegWit and those updates, we're already looking at 2x to 6x increase in capacity plus all the fixes and performance and security improvements that SegWit makes. LN will hopefully add another 100x or 1000x or even more in the long term. Probably still not enough for the whole world to use Bitcoin, but a lot better than having 1GB blocks and still not reaching that goal.
Anyway, enjoy the ride.

I agree with all that. People can vote with their money or their feet or however you want to call it as they can in any free market. And yes it should be slow, not frozen static (not yet anyway) but slow and careful.
But the point is that it has nothing to do with nakamoto consensus or 10 minutes or miners voting. That's a whole different aspect of bitcoin.
Same as that you can now vote to move all your value to litecoin. That's voting with your feet/money: a free market option that you have. But that certainly doesn't have anything to do with 10 minutes or what miners choose to mine.


That's where the nonsense starts. Mining/voting is stretched waay beyond breaking point to voting about the rules and democracy. Just because the word "voting" can be used to describe both situations doesn't mean they have anything to do with each other.  nor that the meaning of the word voting is the same in both situations. And that's a good thing, otherwise it would mean that miners have all the voting power, which is clearly (and luckily) not true.
Classic is the most dangerous attack bitcoin has ever faced. No matter what they suggest, if a bunch of noobs can persuade a majority to follow them to do stupid populist shit, then bitcoin apparently isn't worth anything. The jet engine hasn't spun up fast enough at all.

Bullcrap. Hard forks don't resolve disagreements and certainly not attacks. Hard fork attempts ARE attacks and fuel disagreement.

No it's not fair at all. It's nonsense.
Long term close to 100% of the block reward will go to paying electricity bills (in $ / yaun). The only times there is excess profitability is when the price shoots up and the difficulty lags behind. That does not depend on the absolute value of the block reward at all.
Bitcoin fees are paying for security against double spend attacks. Fact is that LN channels are a lot less at risk from double spend attacks: low value channels spread over many people constantly being netted means there no way an attacker can do a huge $1million purchase and then do a re-org to double spend it.
LN transactions pay less in fees per LN transactions, but they're also lower risk, so don't need the high security and aren't worth the higher fee. That also means if LN would not exist at all, then those transactions would likely not be done at all as they're not worth the higher fees.

How the F is it unlikely that they do a hard fork attempt and then within days or a week those miners realize they can't sell their coins anywhere and they come running back to where the value is.

Of course it has to do with stuck transactions. They've been happening for 3+ years now and no matter what happens, they will become more frequent.
No, there are actually not a whole lot of ways to solve that problem. As with everything in Bitcoin, most simple answer you can come up with don't work for some intricate reason. RBF and CPFP can work, if miners accept them.


Nice hyperbole... I don't think the 0.25MB difference between the roadmap and hostile takeover is going to make that much difference.

I wasn't arguing for UASF (yet) as i haven't read too much about it (yet) simply because i could instinctively feel there would be many dangers if not outright impossible. Thanks for mentioning a few.
I mostly wanted to say that the 5% didn't need to worry and won't get forced to upgrade. Most people tend not to know the extent of compatibility and opt-in without force SegWit goes to.
I fully assumed the sane wild hold for UASF, but if this is true:


Then that sounds really dumb. So dumb that i kind of doubt it's in their proposal tbh.
Clearly trying to orphan miners while being in a minority is dumb, but they'd even refuse the help that honest non-segwit miners provide in growing the chain. That doesn't make sense.

I guess my opinion was too harsh. It's not that bad. But there are some details.


Nothing to do with didechain. 


Not since segwit.


Not really. There's now more block space, which makes transactions cheaper. In future there might be a mode where signatures are excluded from an initial block download, but I don't think that's in use yet. It would not make anything cheaper apart from reducing the bandwidth usage and download time somewhat.


Signatures are not removed and also not stored separately. Only counted differently. And they get stripped out when sent to an old node that doesn't understand SegWit at all, to present them with a backwards compatible valid block.


Bech32 not "needed" and as far as i know not used (yet) by LN. But i may be completely wrong on that as there's probably no reason not to anymore.


Not really SegWit's fault: fees are too low currently. Once they increase again there's an automatic incentive to adopt SegWit.


The n-th hostile takeover attempt had been long in the making, SegWit was just the excuse that scammers and their gullible suckers who believed in eternally free unicorns fell for.


It was never meant to be forced upon people. (That's what centralized scamcoins do.)  Whoever needs it can use it. Some say it's even better to not use it (unless you really need it) to avoid increasing the size of the blockchain too much.
The important part of the adoption is that most full nodes have switched to supporting and enforcing SegWit. That is certainly the case. The fact that wallets don't all create SegWit transactions yet is fairly irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:00:27

Good. That moment has long past, so we're on the right track.


Core already worked on a solution to what was the demand but then all the goal posts were moved, because it turns out the scammers don't want big blocks, they just want Bitcoin to fail in order to pump their own scams. Where is your guarantee that that won't happen again?
Also: what makes you think "Core" can even set a flag date? Bitcoin is decentralized, you know.
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:26:41




1GB blocks would obviously be very problematic. From 1MB to 1GB is a scale from whatever you want to call today to "very problematic". And not a linear scale either: quadratic (at least without SegWit). So any useful increase in block size gets us towards problematic very quickly.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:07:20


Such a nonsensical thing to say. You don't change two fundamental things at once in a delicaty balanced highly complex system. One at a time is already hard enough to get right and then you wait a monitor things for a while to make sure all is going well and to learn about this never before done experiment.
And then you allow transaction sizes to halve, because any kindergartner can tell that halving overhead is a superior way of scaling than blindly doubling a max size.
That already delivers you 4x to 6x of todays capacity.
And only then do we increase the block size again. Even a small increase will get you a lot more than you're asking for here.
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:33:29

Why the extra, below the belt, drama? 1.8x is already scheduled to launch in 2 months or so. More true scaling (20 to 40% smaller transactions) might even become feasible before a 2x HF which is already on the roadmap and many core devs say (pledged) july 2017.
Does that sound remotely like


? Well then don't lower yourself to troll levels please.
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:47:16
Yes 20MB plus very rapid automatic growth to 8GB.
@_date: 2016-03-22 13:21:09
Yes that is true. It can flip back to the core chain, but not the other way around.
That's actually another argument that would make the "attack" (actually a defensive move) that I described in another post safer and therefore more likely for the attacker: if 35% of the hashing power fakes classic support but then switches back to the Core chain, they can rake in huge profits, while the classic miners are wasting their time pissing into the wind.
I think I would love to see that happen, that should be a nice lesson to ward off any further hard fork attacks for the coming decades.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:55:13
4M max is only under really unlikely and contrived adversarial conditions as the effect is pointless and expensive for the attacker as well as easy to defend against. So there's no reason to think that "rescaling" means SegWit is 4 MB so 2/4/8 will be just 1 doubling and then done. Obviously not. 
But even if it is, then it's still at least one doubling, which means together with SegWit (2.3x), further updates (2x) and other side effects of progress, still means at least 8x today's transaction capacity. Which is still more than 2/4/8 would have ever produced. So again: you're whining and FUDing with zero arguments Blocking an update that is ready 4 months ago and together with the further updates will scale more and faster and safer than 2/4/8 ever would have. You're being hypocritical and you are clearly lying about your motives.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:48:55
They're awesome and insightful. And I'd recommend everyone to listen at least a few, but I'm not sure if it's really that suitable for a newcomer to learn a lot (mostly about to stay away from scams). Especially since OP was asking "technologically". They're certainly not the best for technical details and explanations. They're often slightly (or completely) wrong on technical details actually.
My advice to OP would be: start with the Satoshi white paper. It's well readable and short, although you'll miss a lot of important nuances and details at first, the general idea should catch on quickly when you read it.
Then follow several reddit users: nullc, adam3us, maaku7, taek42, petertodd and luke-jr (although he's a hard nut to follow because of all his side interests in fantasy and fairy tales).
Then find all youtube videos by all those people and watch those. And follow those people on IRC ( and  and/or twitter if that floats your boat.
Last piece of advice: learning Bitcoin is a multi-year experience. If you think you know all after a week or month or even a year, then you can be sure that you don't. There are many more rabbit holes to go through, each of which upturns huge chunks of your understanding.
edit: oh and please if you ever find yourself in rbtc or bitcoin.com make sure you interpret everything you read as likely a lie and don't let it confuse you. It's good to be aware that it exists, as it's a beautiful display of an ongoing attack Bitcoin has to contend with. But don't get suckered in. It's really a lot like Lord of the Rings unfortunately.

While Core was busy preventing Bitcoin from sinking faster than the titanic by optimizing the hell out of performance and bandwidth and increasing security, all required to even think about any sort of blocksize increase, BU never developed ANYTHING. Not a single thing. (And that's being very generous because if I'd mention what shit they have produced, I'd have to tell about how it's completely untested, proven full of bugs, DOS and other securty vulnerabilities. It even burnt down testnet without anyone noticing. And it's based on bad assumptions only a completely ignorama could come up with.) So sounds like a really well thought out and convincing argument you're making there. /s
Oh and


Gross pathetic lie and you know it. BU are plagiarizing all over the place and running with many year old Core ideas and pretending to be their own. And the funny thing is those ideas were already obsoleted by better ideas (also from Core) but BU devs were too incapable of even understanding those newer ideas so they stole and worked on the wrong ones. Ending up with a pathetically bad (including bugs and security vulnerabilities) and inefficient implementation.
2. Bullshit. Debunked a million times.
3. Bullshit.
4. BIP welcome. No alternative exists or has even been invented yet. Bitcoin is hard, gee who would have thought.
5. Bullshit. They would do exactly the same thing. Literally.
6. Bullshit. Most of the features appear automatically from the simple basic principles of how SegWit works. Whether you pick block size increase or malleability fix or whatever as the main feature, the other features are automatically there. That's the epiphany of beautiful engineering. Oh and SegWit also cleans up huge amounts of technical debt this way and makes Bitcoin and more importantly all related 3rd party applications simpler and safer!
7. Debunked bullshit. If there is a flaw it's best that the whole chain freezes and resumes after a fix. That way there's no fork and nothing bad happens. Multiple implementations will cause forks to happen in case of malfunction which are a pain to fix and guarantee people to lose money. BTW pretending BU is an alternative implementation is utter dishonest bullshit as it's just Core minus some important improvements and some deliberately messed up and buggy misfeatures. By alternative implementation honest people mean something like btcd.


Nothing but a parroted troll checklist you copied without a second of critical thinking.


Ah yeah.. the old Gavin and Ver trick... I'm not against it, I'm just going to think up imaginary shit and dump on it and its creators and then do my utmost to block it.


They won't be. More scaling, including a hard fork has already been in Core's roadmap for over a year now and a lot of work went into that.
Like how SegWit enables halving transactions sizes (IOW another doubling of capacity) through Schnorr and Signature Aggregation and MAST. Those are mostly ready and waiting and can be rolled out quickly after SegWit.

Because it isn't awesome. It's a dogshit slow database. Any 1990's SQL database server would be more efficient, even on 2000's hardware. And even SQL is overkill for what is needed to keep a simple ledger with a few transactions per second.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:55:11


It needs 51% not actively going out of their way to steal people's money. But they don't need to mine SegWit. Non caring neutral miners with a long term realisation that stealing is not good for the Bitcoin price, are fine too.
And once activated there's this big carrot for more miners to join: higher fees because of bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:19:49
Nope. Too bad trolly. Damage control failed. OP post is correct.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:22:45


Variance. Small miners suffer from huge variance: they might be lucky one month to find 2 blocks, and then unlucky and only 1 block in 3 months. By joining a pool, they lower their variance and enjoy having regular (almost guaranteed) payouts. In a flat situation, that actually costs them money in the long term (pool fees). But because the the difficulty keeps increasing, it's better to get some money now than be unlucky and not find a block at all: with time your mining equipment gets less and less % of the total.
If the difficulty ever settles and stops going to the moon for an extended period of time, that will actually have 2 benefits: small miners can decide to stop paying miner fees and just take the variance. And hardware doesn't obsolete within a few months, so it can become worthwhile for "normal" people (not living next door and befriended to an ASIC fab) to acquire a machine and mine a little.
But then again, every time the price of Bitcoin shoots up, the mining difficulty will follow.


My suggestion was sort of poolless: any miner can create a block template and then advertise "hey guys, I'll give you X satoshi for each share that you help me with this block". I was hoping to make that block template as minimal as possible (ideally only the coinbase address) so that all other miners have to run their own full node and can decide for themselves what to put in each block.
But one big problem there is that those helper-miners don't care about the fees because they're getting paid a fixed amount per share, so they can just mine empty blocks. Maybe the reward for shares should be a percentage instead of fixed. Another problem is that I think the primary miner can do double spends paying several helpers but once the block is found they turn out to be doublespends. Not sure if it's possible to make a smart contract to prevent that.


They're working on the same block height (having the same parent block) I guess, but the new block doesn't have to be the same for all miners in a pool. I think. That's probably the easiest way for a pool, but if it wanted it could give each miner a different block to work on or even let the miner decide most of the block himself, that should be possible. All the pool cares about is that the block reward goes to their address.

Note: i haven't made up my mind on UASW yet. I would only imagine it being with trying if an overwhelming majority of economic nodes participates. But even then it is risky and will confuse some people who aren't paying attention.
For me personally I'd probably just simply not do any transactions at all for a few weeks.
On the plus side, of love to see those uncooperative miners go flat on their face and having to give up a few weeks of income. Awesome way to show them who's boss.
Anyway. It's still fundamentally different from what BU wants to do. A chain split+reorg is very different from a hard fork.

July now? Has classic foregone March 1, or is that your date? I haven't been keeping track today.
As per your suggestion: I'm not one of the devs so they might think otherwise, but i imagine doing 2 things at once will increase code complexity and the dangers of something going wrong during the rollout. But at least longer dev+ testcases+ testing+ release cycle.
Also a hard fork needs a much higher consensus level' 95% out more. And everyone needs to upgrade before that time, not just the miners, so that will probably take a lot longer than just doing SW now.
Also you're losing the benefit of SW giving us a smooth growth as wallet and user adoption rises (and is a beautiful way to push people to upgrade their wallets to use SW), instead of one abrupt jump. Sort of like a shock absorber that dampens the drop in fee pressure (everyone will want lower fees again, since there's plenty space anyway) but it also dampens problems if a bitcoin gets a huge influx of more users: growing pressure for people to use SW, but not an immediate sky rocket of the fee.
What makes a soft fork in 2017 better than a soft fork now?
Also note that further than 1.75 can be achieved by relatively minor extra changes after SW, so it might already be more than a doubling during 2016.

LN transactions don't nearly add anywhere near as much risk to the system as normal transactions do. They're low value and kicked in payment channels. An attacker trying to steal money through 51% attacks can't possibly get much money out of LN. One simple $1M transaction however is a juicy target for a reorg.
At the same time LN does bring an influx of new user cases and users all of whom need bitcoin. This by itself strengthens bitcoin as a whole since there are more and more decentralized stakeholders in the system. More stakeholders to be against any attacks for dear of losing money.
@_date: 2017-03-06 02:42:24
Having mining done on general hardware has (at least) two problems, i think:
1) miners aren't loyal, they jump to whatever coin pays higher fees. They're not invested in Bitcoin. That also takes away a huge part of their incentive to not attack the chain that feeds them. In fact it means there's an incentive to attack the 2nd largest chain or the chain that's small enough to 51%attack.
2) It takes away the nuclear option from users. They can't fire the miners anymore if they misbehaved. Changing the poW didn't help anything.

Would it be correct to say that this validationless mining changes a 51% attack into a 46% attack (at least temporarily)? 30 seconds being %5 of 10 minutes, so for at least 30 seconds the whole network is _helping_ the attacker by building on top of his block (and not working on a competing block).
Is it also fair to say that there is an incentive to delay blocks ~30 seconds to try to partition off of the network a few miners that time out and switch back to building on the parent block? Basically getting us back into the current situation only shifted ~30 seconds?

The fact that the word consensus is used in two different contexts might be confusing you.
Bitcoin uses the blockchain + PoW to allow every node to automatically reach consensus on the longest valid chain.
However, the definition of the word "valid" in there needs a while different sort of consensus. One that is determined and progressed through BIPs and discussions and small incremental changes. Why slow? Because money is trust and people need to be able to trust that the rules underlying their money don't change on the whim of mob rule. Anything not doing that is monopoly money.

They'll screw off by themselves once the fees go up again.
It's actually good that adoption is not at 100% as:
1) that means we have a nice buffer once fees start rising: adoption will rise which reduces the pressure on the fee market.
2) the growth rate of the blockchain is lower (smaller blocks).

They won't be. They'll just move the goal posts again.
SegWit is a no-brainer and does more than those idiots want. If they're too dishonest to see it, there's nothing that will help them. Their loss.
It's not about block size and hasn't been for years. It's purely about power and control. And that's all the more reason to not compromise a single bit. Not that any compromise has any place in Bitcoin whatsoever anyway, it's not a beauty contest, it's science that decides.

That's a complete non-argument that has been debunked a million times, but keeps being parrotted by people with only a superficial understanding.
Miners are not one happy group with one voice and one objective. Miners are individuals that compete with each other. Miners that can cause other miners to go out of bussiness automatically earn more themselves, so they will do that. Thus centralization into bigger and bigger pools run by fewer and fewer individuals.

Depends on how contentious it is. If the current climate holds, 1000 years. No Hard Fork is going to happen before SegWit and the Schnorr+SA+MAST and such. That's like more than 4x scaling, so more than any viable Hard Fork proposal ever. After that, the current scammers will have been flushed from the system and possibly we can have consensus on a planned hard fork that does some useful clean ups and optimizations as well as some blocksize increase (possibly flexible if it has been invented by then).
If HF is still impossible by then, nothing to worry about: extension blocks will do just fine.
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:11:41


Dude. Have you ever looked at the brainpower that is in Core and compared it to any competition? You're comparing NASA or SpaceX to a chop shop in the Bronx. And that's no exaggeration.
People don't buy into Bitcoin on the off chance that after 3+ years of trying and failing this 10th attempt at a hostile takeover by amateurs is going to succeed, while all signs are pointing at yet another failure.
People reward stability and progress and trends that continue on that path, when investing in something.
No I don't know any of how many more people want to invest for how long and how rich they are. If you prefer a lower price and think that somehow indicates  a better situation than what we have now... whatever.
People are paying to get their transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. How is that not a good thing? What other statistic would ever prove that Bitcoin has any use at all? If there's one single statistic that can independently show the usefulness of Bitcoin as a number that's very hard to manipulate then it's the fee per byte.
And you can quit whining about niche. SegWit is here, so whine somewhere else. Like I said, Core has more scaling in the pipeline than any plausible Hard Fork attempt ever made (and none of those were ever implemented, so they would take at least a year to develop, test en prepare for rollout). You want scaling now: SegWit. You want more scaling within a year: Core's Schnorr, SA, MAST. And in the meantime we can see if LN may become plausible and then that's an extra 10x, 100x, 1000x and continually growing scaling, with hardly extra effort.
There's no faster path no matter how much you wish or whine. Too bad. Thank the rbtc idiots for sabotaging SegWit since its announcement instead of helping to develop and test it. Thank the rbtc idiots for sabotaging the whole blocksize debate for years.


Tell that to the Americans today. Tell that to the Germans in 1935. Tell that to companies that invested heavily because of some subsidy/trade opportunity on day one and that went bankrupt because the democracy voted for someone else the next day.
"Democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time." That quote talks about running countries/governments. Bitcoin isn't a government, it stands a good chance of becoming something much much better than that. Why do you want to drag human political shit into a purely technical system?


Insofar they are backward compatible they're just that and just like SegWit. Insofar they're not backward compatible they're different protocols, no matter what label humans stick onto it. (You clearly didn't think that through yet.)


nullc did not so long ago. It needed a few tweaks in the P2P protocol (which has nothing to do with consensus so nothing to do with soft or hard fork or anything we're talking about here). And then it works just fine, only dog slow. It syncs up all the way to the latest block. And it would sync SegWit blocks just fine in case you're wondering.


Eh... WTF difference does it make where I get my blocks from? Bitcoin P2P, BitTorrent, USD key smuggled across the border, carrier pigeon, satellite, DVB receiver. All possible and done today. They all have nothing to do with consensus.


So fucking what? Do you want an update where nobody needs to update and magically everything is pixies? Are you in favor of pushing an update down everyone's throat even if they don't want it? You don't like the free choice people have with SegWit where they can chose themselves whether to update or not?
And if it makes you feel better, I will update and use SegWit, so that means I use less block weight and therefore you automatically without updating get some extra space for your transactions. Ain't I the nicest?


That's not all, but it's enough. If some people don't want it, it's contentious and thus your hard fork is damaging and pushing things on people against their will and will cause two chains and loss of funds and a mess. For no reason.


"Stay" ...  "new rules"  == contradiction!
And no. You can't force anything on me. And the fact that you're even thinking about doing it makes you unethical. 


Again contradiction. You're predending not to want to force, but then you're advocating a change that forces.
And all that is totally unnecessary because SegWit avoids all that shit and there's plenty more scaling coming. You get more and don't even need to think about how to solve the hard fork mess anymore.


So you have a bitcointalk link where you suggest that in 2012 or earlier?


Ver is still hammering on almost free transactions today. Andreas used to do it too until recently. And many others.  Pretty sure Eric Voorhees did too. Many of the public figures that people tend to run into first when discovering Bitcoin. No not the majority, cause the majority has actually given it a bit more thought and understands that fees are required and thus miners will go for the fees and not the free transactions.


You haven't shown any reason why it would die. And the price, fees and usage levels contradict you.


SPV was a nice dream Satoshi had, but it turned out to be likely impossible and it doesn't exist today. SegWit actually brings us a big step closer (another reason to activate it) but even then it won't be SPV like Satoshi described it. Anything in the whitepaper based on that can therefore be discarded. Which includes running nodes in datacenters only.
But again, instead of regurgitating years old debunked rbtc talking points, all you're doing is providing more and more reasons why SegWit needs to be activated sooner rather than later. I'm not sure why you're so stubborn to have to keep going back to "anything-but-SegWit" so desperately. Is your head too deep in the sand that you're afraid to admit that SegWit solves all problems you've mentioned so far (and many more) elegantly and in a non-forceful manner, precisely with the sort of updating mechanism invented and used many times by Satoshi himself?
SegWit even makes a future hard fork easier! (if uncontentious) You best shot at ever getting a hard fork is activating SegWit today.
Anyway, go think things through some more on your own. Nobody is reading this deep anymore, so I'm not wasting my time on one person that clearly is stuck in bigbluckhardfurksonly mode.

The war is not won with hashing power.
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:43:53
BTW, saying you're intending to do soft limits means you don't need 4MB blocks tomorrow. First soft limit 2MB reasonable? And then 3 a year later maybe?
Gee, SegWit gives exactly that already and instead of a centralized authority deciding on the exact soft limit (or worse: miners), with SegWit the users can decide for themselves. Why are you trying to enforce your view on others?
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:41:12
Yeah, that's impossible on many levels. The don't have the power to promise anything, except maybe do their best to design/build and promote something. But also because fee levels don't mean anything and can be easily faked and gamed, so that would be similar to handing all power to miners, which would fundamentally break Bitcoin.
Also, SegWit is a block size increase and will lower the fees (yet increase total fees earned by miners, so both users and miners can be happy).
LN will can pick up all the small transactions that are priced out by the higher fees of Bitcoin, so Bitcoin as a whole becomes more usable and finally live up to its promise of micropayments. At the same time more usage will again raise the onchain fees thus miners can be happy again. More and more diverse usage will also raise the Bitcoin price, so again both users and miners can be happy.

That's exactly what Core people have been doing even before Gavin started his XT failure. They convinced me fairly early on. I too wanted a flying pig (everyone does) and i naively assumed it was possible. Reading a few clear posts outlining the problems convinced me that unfortunately flying pigs are not that easy. Which should be no surprise to anyone with two feet on the ground: bitcoin is brand new uncharted territory, a lot of learning and work still remains.
Also if you read the roadmap that came out of that "committee" you will see that there lifting of the pig has already begun. Soon it will be 1.75m in the air. I guess a pig just isn't one of those bird chivks that can fly the very first time they jump out of the nest. Reality can be harsh sometimes.

Not technically. And if the experts say that it's currently impossible then there's no amount of wishful thinking that is going to help.

Not much. Subsidized by block rewards. Only possible through enormous efforts by Core to make Bitcoin more and more efficient in all aspects (CPU, memory, disk, I/O and latency). Most limits there have been pretty much reached. SegWit opens up a few great new ones, like Schnorr, SA and MAST, but it's diminishing returns.

Oxygen can be extremely rare very locally. Try sticking your head in a plastic bag for 10 minutes and you'll find out. A few inches further and oxygen is plentiful, but rare where you need it. At that moment you'd probably pay someone $100 to poke a hole in the bag and make your oxygen supply less rare.

Unusable is a big word. $1200 says it's not unusable. Although that probably includes a lot of SegWit expectation.


That's altcoins. That's fine.


That contradicts your previous sentence.


That's a censoring attack. It only takes one miner to mine such transactions and then other miners will have to actively orphan those blocks. Bitcoin breaks down with a majority of miners evil enough to do that. That's outside its security assumptions. That's not Bitcoin anymore but paypal 2.0. That's why decentralization is so important.
It's certainly not an argument against SegWit.


Not all at once. SegWit first. Then optimizations that will halve the transaction sizes (that's always better than doubling block sizes) and then some hard fork if it's uncontentious or maybe an extension block soft fork.


Hard to make predictions about LN now. But Core has 4x to 8x of onchain scaling ready (SegWit) or almost ready (Schnorr, Signature Aggregation, MAST) and is working on further HF options, so there's no reason to worry for quite a while. And by that time we'll know more about LN too.


Wishes and dreams don't make things real. Science+hard engineering work do, up to the limits that the universe imposes upon us.


Running anything but the reference client is a danger to the Bitcoin network. Only bad things can happen: theft, loss of money, partition attacks... Best case you follow consensus but then you might as well have run the reference client to begin with. In any other case you're of the network and no longer validating the right chain, endangering you, all SPV nodes connecting to you and the whole network.
This includes running "friendly" alternative clients, let alone idiocy like XT, classic and BU.
It's not a vote because as it's unheard while everything goes ok and then when shit hits the fan you're on a different system so nobody cares anymore.


Different chains means altcoins. Everybody is free to invest or divest in any. That's not so much voting (as in democracy) but that's just applying your free market weight. Free market competition is fine and that's what will ultimately determine which coin makes it. That's not democracy though.
And it also doesn't determine what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin may die and some other coin might steal the label, but that doesn't make them the Bitcoin we are taking about here.
Note: the only situation where the above can happen without confusion is an uncontentious hard fork. And even then history books will have to disambiguate pre-fork and post-fork where necessary.
There's a difference between Bitcoin the concept/system (defined by satoshi) and Bitcoin the label/word.
There are many dollars in the world but you always need context or disambiguation to know which one you're talking about otherwise you'll certainly lose your wealth very quickly. If the US vanishes tomorrow, and Zimbabwe renames theirs to USD, it still means nothing.

Idiocy like him building backdoors into Junior routers. Or him having proven that Bitcoin can't exist. All that crap.
To be honest, I'm not sure there's much we (or nullc himself) even can do about it, ask if it gets down voted to invisibility (if not outright banned) anyway. All one can do is hope a reporter may have seen it and does an honest attempt at doing his job.
I've been censored from rbtc myself, as have most people trying to speak truth and oppose the misinformation. I always upvote his and the few remaining brave souls, Although I'm not even sure that still works when banned. Maybe i should create a new account. I dunno.

By trustless i mean in a similar manner that lightning network works. Normally the coinbase is a transaction that pays the mining pool operator and all the miners trust him to do payouts. That means you prefer to join a bigger pool that can be trusted (centralization). But if the coinbase instead directly opens a (sort of) payment channel then whenever a miner gives a share to the pool, the pool can send back a micropayment transaction on that channel, splitting the coinbase fairly among all miners who delivered shares.
(I'm seeing big problems with this idea btw, not sure if possible or that it would solve any problem.)


Probably yes. Not sure if that's avoidable at all. If miners aren't mining on the same block then the other guy can't trust that the share is valid without also receiving the whole header and all transaction.


I think I've already thought of a reason why it wouldn't work actually​. I'll think about it some more in the coming days.


Need to read and think a bit more to even be able to say what's confusing. Maybe it will be less confusing tomorrow.

I don't speak for Core, but as far as I understand none of Core devs really like the current "SPV" implementation. It's horrible for privacy and it externalizes a lot of cost onto full node operators for no compensation.
Besides, if you don't run a full node, you're not using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:58:03
Bitcoin is still an experiment or beta if you like. Very much still growing and changing. You can't really expect otherwise.
You can still continue with your current wallet. Just don't accept 0conf from transactions that you can't verify yourself (nothing to do with SW, there are many other transactions like that).
Next step would be to at least be able to verify SW transactions going to you. And the last step of actually sending out SW transactions you can do whenever you feel like it. Just wait for other wallets to do it first, so you can learn and copy from them.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:27:44
That's why I'm saying it's not the same thing and it will give you a fell for it. Of course it's only annoying if i have to wait an hour to get in sync.
But PART of that wait is also incurred by the miners that depend on moving to the next block ASAP. 
You're now handwaving away problems that you agree might exist by saying they'll be easily fixed by software optimisation. 
Well luckily most of the ideas on how to do that have  already been invented and worked out by the core people already, but it still takes a lot of hard work to get that implemented. Why don't classic people work on that instead of first making the problems exponentially bigger before promising to think about solutions?

Not on the free market called BitTorrent, so yeah, thanks for making my point.


So 2nd layer shit is good. And increasing the block size is good. Making Bitcoin itself safer and more performant and efficient is good. Preparing Bitcoin for further huge scaling improvements is good. Fixing Bitcoin to allow those 2nd layer shit to be safer and more efficient must be good too.
All that is good, right?
All that is done by SegWit.
Yet you block all that progress because in your, already proven warped view, it's not enough. So you are keeping everybody from reaching a whole new level of Bitcoin goodness, just because you think it doesn't go far enough.
How does that feel?

Depends on how large that bunch is. 
Also UASW is not arbitrarily changing what's valid, it's tightening the rules, meaning nothing that used to be invalid will ever become valid. Which is the most important side of validation as Satoshi specifically allowed for extra space to be later carved out in exactly this backwards compatible manner.

His biggest problem seems (to me) that the lies and attacks on his personal life and career aren't being countered enough so that when a reporter writes a news story based on that misinformation, it ends up in the news papers uncontested. Idiocy like him building backdoors into Junior routers. Or him having proven that Bitcoin can't exist. All that crap.
To be honest, I'm not sure there's much we (or nullc himself) even can do about it, ask if it gets down voted to invisibility (if not outright banned) anyway. All one can do is hope a reporter may have seen it and does an honest attempt at doing his job.
I've been censored from rbtc myself, as have most people trying to speak truth and oppose the misinformation. I always upvote his and the few remaining brave souls, Although I'm not even sure that still works when banned. Maybe i should create a new account. I dunno.
As for Ver I must say I have absolutely no respect for him whatsoever and there's literally nothing he could ever do to regain the tiny bit i once had (which had never been much higher than benefit of the doubt anyway).
Even if he turns out to be completely right in his strategy and Core was FUDding all along and we can safely scale to 1GB blocks. And then on top of that he personally saves my children from a burning house. (All of which are obviously impossibly hypothetical.) Even then I would not respect him one bit. He's actively trying to destroy good honest, hard working people. Both by personal words and actions as well as by stirring up his brown shirts and the general ignorants to do his dirty work.

Wow. You think just because your a miner your somehow the elite that has voting rights to decide that the non voting plebs are not allowed to decide what they want for Bitcoin, calling them an attack on your rights?
News for you buddy: mining is nothing like a democracy. You don't have any vote to begin with. There's nothing to vote about. Users decide what they want and your job is to figure out what that is and then prepare for it and do it. If you don't, you go obsolete one way or the other.
SegWit asks you to signal when you're ready with your preparations. That's not a vote.
And if we figure out a way to do SegWit without miner activation then you better not attempt to censor that or steal. SegWit is fully within the rules set out by satoshi. SegWit is not an attack. SegWit is a technical solution and improvement to countless problems. It's a no brainer. And a large growing majority of users (the people that hire you and allow you to have good on the table) want it.

For example removing RBF: 
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:27:06
Not true... SW is merely on their TODO list along with a lot of other things. Problem is they don't have a dev that is capable of even implementing it, so they have to completely depend on stealing it from Core. As long as Core is still being updated that is.
Unless "one-feature patch" on their website is a lie, which is actually highly likely as they are already talking about dropping opt-in RBF.

LN transactions are already severely limited (hard coded) to small value transactions. Especially in the beginning.

@_date: 2017-03-04 02:33:55
Apart from reasons mentioned already, another important one is that at least initially LN will be artificially limited to small amounts. I think something like $40 per channel if I remember correctly. That's mostly to protect people from bugs or their own stupid mistakes. It's also to let it grow steadily and lessons can be learned and further steps be taken to scale correctly. It also means LN can't replace reasonable size Bitcoin transactions: you can't really send $1000 or even $100 through LN initially as you'll drain all the channels.

Bitcoin is currently under attack by at least two hostile takeover attempts. One by Ver and BU and one by Jihan. Ver may think Jihan is on his side, but he's only using Ver to get increased power BU gives to miners. After he has reached his goal, he'll dump those idiots.
On the other hand, once SW activates, that's a huge victory for Bitcoin as that means the attacks have failed and indeed that the honeybadger keeps on going. I fully expect a jump in price and a boost for morale and speed of progress once SW activates. On price I've been wrong many times, but the other point is pretty much impossible not to come true (eventually causing the first to come true too).

I agree it has many inaccuracies, but concerning your points:
1. Yes it is. Any full solution will come down to what segwit does. You can call it differently, apply a bunch of NIH syndrome and handwave a lot, but it will just be a crappy version of SegWit.
2. It doesn't strictly need SegWit because it was invented before SegWit and worked around malleability in other ways. But with SegWit LN is just so much better, easier and safer that there's no point in thinking about it, let alone implementing without SegWit.
Majority UTXOs currently being malleable is completely irrelevant in context of LN. LN cares about the 2of2 HTLC being SegWit, not the UTXOs that funded it. Opening a channel makes it SegWit and thus non-malleable where it matters.

Adding gears in between existing gears is not adding capacity. Just optimizing existing bandwidth. Which Core does and has done plenty for years. SegWit is like doubling the horse power and doing all the other things like upgrading the gearbox, suspension and brakes (as far as that hadn't been done before yet).
But I guess that's what you get with bullshit analogies.


You'll swallow that bullshit soon enough when SegWit steams past 50% and higher. Oh no, you won't as you trolls have been wrong for years now, but never admitted to anything, just moved the goal posts yet again.

Yeah there are plenty of arguments, repeated daily by everyone with a brain, including the independent individuals that Gavin+Hearn dubbed Core. And SegWit is already more than 2MB block size increase, so stop saying stupid shit already.

Still stuck on year old debunked lies? Wow.
SegWit makes further Hard Forks easier, not harder. Even better: SegWit is required for any Hard Fork to even have a chance of being safe and getting consensus ever.
1.7 is outdated guess, More recent estimates are larger than 2MB. And you know that.


Oh, so your argument is that some people may not need the larger blocks and are willing to pay for the space. And that makes the update bad how? You want to force an update down those peoples throats to FORCE them to do something you want them to do? Yeah that makes a lot of sense...  NOT.
Fact is: EVERYBODY enjoys a benefit from every single SegWit transaction in a block. EVERY SegWit transaction frees up space for ALL other transactions. Fact is practically ALL wallets are ready to roll soon after SegWit activates. There is absolutely no reason to believe anything of the FUD that it's somehow bad if adoption takes a few months. And BLOCKING SegWit for months with that argument is extremely hypocritical.
A year ago "SegWit takes too long, we need 2MB NOW or the world ends".
Now: "Let's block the only possible blocksize increase for 4 months and going."
And at the same time: "SegWit is bad because it may take months before we reach 2MB."
As well as: "BLOCK SegWit for more months."


Although a HF is on the Core roadmap and plans are being worked on and SegWit makes a HF safer and easier: a HF is not necessary for a further block size increase. First of all there are be huge transaction size reductions in the pipeline, which will double throughput (or more). And second, a block size increase can be done without hard fork if necessary. Also: hiding behind LN with crappy arguments like this is totally dishonest again. LN can go for many years if not decades before block size becomes an issue, especially with above mentioned optimizations.


Too bad. Doing it today is impossible. So it's either then if possible and with consensus or it's never. Simple as that.


Ok. So it's established then that Hard Forks are dangerous. Very dangerous. Good.


Bullshit argument, whether it comes from you or from actual miners. It's just bullshit. It's not cleaner at all and makes no sense whatsoever.


Yeah cause it makes total sense that adding a whole new use case to Bitcoin will lower its usage and price. A usecase that was falsely promised by ignoramas years ago (like Ver) to lure newcomers into Bitocin, where you can buy every cup of coffee or minute of wifi usage with zero confirmations and still totally secure.


Fees are like what 1.5BTC with 12.5 BTC block reward. Aren't you being a bit over dramatic here? Seriously!


And that's exactly why miners are hired by and work for the users: users decide what gets done, not miners. Activation is not a vote.

Which is a good point to do a comparison on.


Not for scaling for sure. Conceptually easier? Yeah sure.
Similar to your local wifi network where all devices are basically broadcasting to ask others. Easy to see that that doesn't scale to much further than a few hundred feet and/or more than x devices.
ZWave and such protocols solve this by decreasing the range to 30 feet (or whatever) and then having devices forward packets so multihop transmissions work seemlessly. So yeah they do a bit of automatic (non centralized) pathfinding and when one path turns out to be temporarily gone it tries a different path. Not really rocket science, although sure there are many many options and variables to play with.

RAM on a harddisk is cache. LN is like a (write) cache. LN consolidates (caches) many tiny write operations over time into 1 actual and slow block chain write.
It's insane to assume hard disk manufacturers would say "we're don't want RAM cause it competes with our own thing". 
Cache on hard disks opens up use cases that do many writes per second to the same sector. Those are use cases that were impossible without cache and increase the demand for such hard disks.

Very good podcast series on a scam that most Bitcoiners ignored even more than other scamcoins, because it was so blatantly obvious. The onecoin scammers deliberately avoided knowledgeable bitcoiners and instead targeted the most vulnerable and tech illiterate people they could find, promising them a better than bitcoin 1000x returns (gee, what other scammer said that recently?).

Welcome to Bitcoin. It's good to see you critical and not falling for obvious scams. 99% of things you're going to encounter in this space are scams. BSV is only one. It and all other shitcoins are off topic on this sub, that's why your posts may be removed.
Be critical of Bitcoin too, but keep an eye on some of the differences: Shitcoins promise you easy infinite scaling. Shitcoins promise you quick riches. When it sounds too good to be true, it definitely is. Shitcoins have low number of devs and they usually don't have a clue what they're talking about. Most shitcoins have one leader. Most shitcoins were premined by said leader, usually denied with all kinds of smoke and mirrors. Most shitcoins are copy/paste jobs of Bitcoin. Some never even update anymore, others take unfinished future Bitcoin code and copy/paste it in to claim to be "first" at some new feature. And you'll discover many more.
The game of shitcoins is to confuse you as much as possible until you wear out and stop being critical. Make sure to stop investing time in them once you've recognized some of the warning signs. You'll get better at it with time.
Learning about Bitcoin is an amazing experience. Try the links in the side bar. Read the white paper. Read posts by people like [ Listen to some podcasts like "What Bitcoin Did". Don't trust, verify. Don't invest in Bitcoin until you feel you're ready and remember that it may fail and you may lose everything. The risk is just a lot lower than when you invest in a shitcoin.

 FYI: you're talking to a well known hardcore classic troll. I appreciate all the excellent explanations and facts you use to debunk him. That's really useful to other readers unaware of the trollery going on. But truthfully: he's heard all this many many times before and he's just out to waste everyone's time.
Note how he keeps avoiding your points and coming up with new (false) ones. First it's "core is blocking any increase above 1MB", then it's 1.6 but after enough people told him it's more like 1.8 to 2.0 he changes the subject to how a HF could be done a year ago and how SW isn't here yet. After your skillful debunking then it's suddenly "usability problems for users" or "SW is good, but it's  the ONLY thing core wants". On and on and on.

Jesus christ, what a dumbfuck post. Hard to decide where to begin...
1. Are these guys "your mechanics"? Do you pay them? Do you own that car you're talking about? What gives you the right to demand what needs to in it? What are your qualifications that you think you know anything whatsoever about the internals of Bitcoin? Why don't you just go do it yourself? There's like 20 people in r/btc that will follow your altcoin.
2. This is not a car, it a moon rocket. Of course a rocket scientists isn't going to listen to a dumbfuck redneck walking in with a supercharger: "I want this on my moon rocket". And again, it's not "your" rocket anyway, noone gives a shit what you want on it.
3. Noone is saying N system is a supercharger. I said SegWit is a block size increase, which it is. You can tell because, you know, the fucking blocks will be bigger (but who gives a fuck?) and contain more transactions (which is actually what matters).
4. I didn't get any wool pulled over my eyes as, unlike you, I didn't have any demands at all. Instead I had a wish for a safely increased transaction capacity, which is exactly what we're getting. Plus a shitload of other even more important improvements. Not only is the rocket going to be twice as big, it will also be much more stable and safe.


Retarded much? Do you even like proofread what your trollmasters give you to spread?


Lie. And again being deceitful, yet not fooling anyone, with the word "effective".


Lie. And bullshit. Plus SegWit also allows for further improvements like Schnorr and MAST and SA and other shit that will easily add up to 6x soon. Even ignoring the real scaling that LN will bring. And ignoring all the extra efficiency and safety that SegWit brings like linear instead of quadratic hashing and malleability fixed.
All combined into a patch that's actually safer, better peer reviewed and less complex than the crap classic came up with.


First of all that's complete crackhead bullshit. Even jtoomim proved 3 MB to be the absolute no margins left maximum in the foreseeable future. Second: how does SegWit prevent any future limit increase? Such a fucking HF is already on the roadmap FCOL.

said it was like the next step up from double entry bookkeeping. Double entry bookkeeping also is moslty just added redundancy and complexity over single entry bookkeeping, merely to avoid errors and make fraud harder to pull off and easier to detect.
Blockchains (without PoW and possibly without actually using blocks) would add another fraud protection/detection layer. As long as different third parties have access to that blockchain (or only the merkle headers) and are able to check among each other that they're all looking at the same ledger as well as detect any rollbacks/forks, that makes many (most) forms of fraud impossible or at least extremely hard.
Makes sense and should definitely be a net positive for any two+ parties with non-100% trust. And can replace huge parts of third-party auditors need to come in at $400/hr for a week to check all the books.
But it doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin and still makes the whole "blockchain without Bitcoin hype" one steaming pile of BS. It just proves those banks have been sleeping and not innovating for at least 25 years, as hashed-linked-lists and basic public/private key cryptography are common for at least that long.

Not was anything you mentioned promised even if they wild have been able to make any such promise. And even if one or two people made any promise, which they didn't, there's no chance in hell for anything reaching consensus right now so they could be forgiven for wasting time on it. Besides anything mentioned there was after SegWit, so there's plenty of time left. And the roadmap of half a year earlier and still relevant today, already mentions a possible hard fork too.

Ah... yeah those were just words that happened to sound nice to your own sheep.
Also, where is your study that explains all those unlikely numbers that you pulled from your ass?
It's the other way around: uptake of SegWit will possibly be an indication of how much the extra block space is really needed. If the blockspace isn't needed, then there's hardly any point in using SegWit, so people will postpone.
Anyway, I'm glad you don't have any problems anymore then, cause as you say 1.4MB will be reached and 1.4MB is your threshold of acceptable. Thanks for accepting SegWit and the SoftFork. Please let us know next time you do have an unacceptable problem. We're very interested to hear.

I never said it was non-easy to be malconfigure your node. Any more strawmen you feel like blowing down?


Nope, nor do I care. I'm protected by my own full node. You can run out of consensus BU crap for all I care. Too bad you're backstabbing some SPV wallets that happen to connect to you assuming you're doing your job, but I guess that's their own fault for assuming that. Still makes you an asshole, but since Bitcoin is built to deal with malicious parties that includes assholes like you too.


Helping them by keeping their transactions stuck even longer. uh huh.


Oh helping them by saying fuck you to the people willing to pay higher fees. Wow, real Robin Hood, aren't ya?


Oh, only 10% to 20% Robin Hood then. Ah. Why not all the way exactly?


That's real sweet of you. I don't mind you relaying or mining low fee transactions. You're a sweet boy like that. And if you're really running a full node, that's awesome. If you're running a non-fully-validating node like BU or Classis, then you're buttfucking all SPV nodes that connect to you, so you  might want to warn them, or not accept connections from them in their own interest.


Me too and I can proudly (proud of them, not my doing) say that Core are currently the only people working hard on it and actually achieving something. For example whatever "Bitcoin was created for" probably requires larger blocks eventually and guess what group of volunteer devs has prepared Bitcoin for such an increase by removing all the performance and security road blocks and then went on to create the actual block size increase. An even larger one than the whiny scamming idiots even demanded: more than 2MB. In a safe, fully peer reviewed and fully tested uncontentious manner. Amazing. Any alternatives that loud mouths kept promising and demanding for years? crickets... didn't do anything. Not a single line of bugfree code. Nothing.


You just said you banned some people.


Eh no you didn't. Nowhere. You couldn't. Because it's not true. I dare you to misconfigure your node today to mine NOPs. Do it. See how much longer you're a miner.
Anyway, you're playing pathetic semantics now. Stuck further and further in your corner.
Bottom line is your FUD was clearly bullshit. You were confusing people by claiming all hell could break lose because poor miners could accidentally mine invalid blocks and oh geez end of the world thus SegWit is evil. Right here, your words:


And I say fuck you. That's FUD and not true in any way. But you start playing games coming up with the most idiotic contrived malconfigured situations where a malicious miner could create invalid blocks... as if that's news. So once again, I say fuck you. The network kicking off malicious miners is not a bug, it's a feature and certainly doesn't have anything to do with SegWit.
Not getting out of your corner, trolly.

You're still missing the point. The longest chain means nothing if the blocks in it aren't valid. Also "longest" is the wrong word, what counts is total amount of work.
The one and only Bitcoin ledger is described by the most-work valid chain.
That's a tie-breaker mechanism that only comes into play when there are two valid chains (two miners found a block simultaneously, or some miner is trying to do some sort of attack with otherwise valid blocks). This has nothing to do with a hardfork. A hardfork by definition creates blocks according to different consensus rules, which means old nodes will see those blocks as invalid.
No matter how much hashpower starts mining invalid blocks with a label on it that says "Bitcoin!", they're all invalid and invisible to Bitcoin nodes (and other honest miners).

Nonsense. The little that the 2 week calibration has anything to do with spikes is caused by the increase in hashing power, which has been a bit more lately because of the price rise.  There's no predicting those pikes (unless you are the spammer coordinating the spikes to coincide with the recalibration in order to give credence to this myth).
There's also no "clearing", there's always a backlog of transactions and has been for a long time. Not enough of these spam transactions ever go into blocks to clear even a fraction of it.

Except for a shitload of electricity. And the loss of opportunity.
Not just for the time it cost to create that invalid block, but also for the 24 minutes afterwards when they were trying to build on top of it.
Oh and the whole Bitcoin network lost out on security, not just for 10 minutes but actually since BU introduced this.
And any SPV node connected to one of these BU nodes lost their false confirmation (at least one) and got a nice doublespend rush in return.
And there are more people who lost: potential attackers that could have exploited this bug to coerce BU nodes to assist in the attack. But I'm actually least worried for them. Because it's inevitable there are more of these bugs in BU.

It's not. It's a totally incompatible altcoin that happened to have been airdropped into btc holders by forking the chain. It has as little to do with bitcoin as Litecoin and the thousands of other scamcoins have.
"To fork" can have three different meanings in the context of bitcoin. Software fork (git fork). Chain fork; i.e. chain split (something bitcoin was designed to never ever do, it would be a very serious bug). And then there's hard/soft fork which are upgrade mechanisms for changing the direction the protocol is allowed to grow the bitcoin blockchain (while still being bitcoin). Soft: rules get more strict (backwards compatible, opt in). Hard: rules get less strict (not backwards compatible, everybody must upgrade).

I think you may. But "can't be made ASIC" is practically impossible. And "big difference (advantage)" doesn't need to be all that big. 10x advantage of ASICs is already killing for the obsolete tech.


Most would switch to more profitable coins in a heart beat. That doesn't mean 100% will just jump ship at once, as a reduced hash power increases the relative profitability for the remaining miners. It's a balance. There is however a delay in that balancing mechanism where the difficulty can only adjust slowly and in a lot of coins that became killing: hash rate dropped, difficulty adjustment took weeks/months making the coin unusable and the profitability completely out of balance for that long, causing even more people to jump ship. Other shitcoins learned from that by making the difficulty adjustment much quicker, but that's a non-solution betraying the weakness of the whole thing as well as causing other problems (giving attackers also more avenues ). The slow difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin (mostly downward, as that is prolonged as hash power decreases) adds to the defense against contentious hard forks.
The choice is actually pretty easy: do you want the security personnel you hire to be dedicated and committed to your property and themselves invest in long term securing of exclusively your property and actually having a stake in your property's well being? Or do you want them to be there, but as soon as your neighbor offers them $1 more for the same work, they jump the fence and you're left with no security.
Bitcoin went through that phase in a time when no neighbors existed, but latecomers will have to make up for that huge barrier by being extremely good I guess and always offering the highest reward. So far none is.


Yeah. Bitcoin created this army of CPU/GPU miners that had to go somewhere when they were no longer sufficient. They're now mercenaries roaming the market. 


Maybe. So far I think practice proves they're mostly following the money. And note that that money is not only mining rewards but may include at some point doing a 51% attack on a poorly secured chain. So those chains are living in a shared neighborhood where the security guards are only protecting the most expensive building leaving the others in low protection plus those same security guards are mercenaries that could decide to go attack one of the low-security buildings themselves.
Bitcoin on the other hand is its own gated building without neighbors and a security force that has no choice but to protect this specific building. There are no other job opportunities out there for them. The only threat they form is colluding to do a 51% attack against the one building that feeds them and their families. A building that would crumble and lose a lot of value (and thus rewards for them) under such a 51% attack.


Well, it's not as easy as one would hope it to be. But it's easier than pretty much any other PoW imaginable algorithm.


Same actually goes for general purpose computer chips. Intel/AMD. Nvidea/ATI. And the same would certainly go for any other ASIC.

The difference is who sets the rules. My company, my rules, I'll allow you to invest. And BlockStream did set very strict rules about influence and evil and such. And I hope it would be easy for a bunch of well established experts with decades of experience each, to find some funding for doing groundbreaking revolutionary tech at the very frontier of science. Just the name and reputation of such a company wild be worth 10x their investment if it works out. Nothing evil needs to be done for that.


Only one of which is at BlockStream? Don't spread lies.


Then users leave and bitcoin price plummets. Whether they'll listen to me or not it's irrelevant (is probably rather they not as I'm not an expert) but the moment they try to pull off bullshit I'm sure as hell walking. I keep a close eye on what they're doing. So far they've always been right and correct, if not on the outcome then certainly on the scientific risk avoiding process. And that's exactly how science works and should work.


That's bullshit. Idiots need to stfu and let the grown ups do their job. Experts fly. All passengers are in a spring role double checking everything the pilots do and make sure there's a pleasant and stimulating atmosphere in the cabin. They get to see all the flight data and blueprints up to every single screw on the whole plane. They can look at whatever they want and have the expertise what to do. And everybody has been issued free parachutes so they can jump off whenever they feel like. You think the wings are about to fall off? Jump. You don't like the flight path avoiding thunderstorms and mountain ranges? Jump. Your also welcome to share your thoughts with others, warn them off possible dangers you think you see or ask them to explain you what you don't get. What is NOT cool though is run around the cabin yelling "BOMB, Terrorist! The pilots are in on it, let's storm the cockpit!" Which is what Ver is doing. Be a man and put your actions where your mouth is: introduce better airplane parts and pilots that actually improve things or jump.

We are using SegWit. SegWit is a good thing. It more than doubles the block size and it will start in a couple of days. It was developed by people who know what they're doing.
SegWit however is completely 100% unrelated to SegWit2x or anyone having anything to do with sw2x. SegWit2x has literally nothing to do with SegWit.

Because it was done by competent people, well designed, peer reviewed and tested (even on live chains with millions of dollars ready to be stolen if that were possible). Because it does things that fixes existing problems. Because it's backwards compatible. Because if in the very unlikely event that there is a bug it can very likely be fixed with a patch or partially rolled back. 


That doesn't make any sense.
You're probably hinting towards "anyone can pay" but that whole point is moot and FUD. It's not anyone can pay. It's also a method that has been used before in earlier soft forks, nothing went wrong there (nobody even complained about it).


Confusing me again with jumping to another subject. But lightning is a completely separate project on a whole different layer that can't possibly affect Bitcoin. If it can, it simply means Bitcoin is already flawed and needs to be fixed, LN will never be the cause.


Not on separate layers. And yes, in Bitcoin development we need the absolute best and most experienced and most careful devs in existance in this planet to slowly and carefully keep improving Bitcoin. To be fair, most of that work is on levels that are unlikely to cause fatal bugs, only consensus bugs could possibly do that.

Sigh. Bitcoin is not a library. You can't break a blockchain.


False. They do validate. Also is not a cheat, it's a mechanism that Satoshi built into bitcoin to be forward compatible and allow future versions to be backwards compatible. (THAT'S HOW you build solid state.) You've already agreed to this by buying into bitcoin, it's part of the consensus.
A cheat is changing the consensus rules and requiring everybody to update, i.e. a hard fork.


Because that's impossible without the fixes contained within SegWit.
You would have known that if you hadn't stopped learning about bitcoin too soon.

Never said i was against hard fork. I just explained the dynamics at play. Kind of got tired of the long post, so i abruptly ended it. 
The point is voting is not done by miners. Rather true (hopefully free) market forces are at play. People putting their money where their mouth is and voting with their feet.
But for a currency to be worth anything people need to trust that it will be with something tomorrow. If some group pulls off a fork that hurts a small 5% minority and those 5% are pushed out, then the other 95% would be retarded to think it won't be their turn next time the same thing happens. 
When you see your neighbours get dragged off in the night and kicked out of town you don't think "i didn't like them anyway, let's now live here in this peaceful town happily ever after".

You're forcefully dragging other people back in? That's not going to give much confidence.
Your describing multiple small towns competing with each other for a while and then doing off. But the thing is none of them will ever become a long lasting metropolis because none of them indoors the confidence that is required for people to trust you as a long term storage of value. It takes a straight clear course with the best possible guarantees that such course will never be deviated from plus a whole lot of years to prove that.

I have. The first version did. And in fact long before LN people were taking about hub and spoke payment channel systems. Back then people imagined a more rigid and manually configured system, possibly with some trust involved which requires anti sybil measures which requires reputation which requires identity etc. which naturally tends to lead to a hub and spoke model. Bitcoin back then want completely ready for the fully trustless version that they describe.
Once people jumped on LN it became clear that there's a way to do away with all that and make it not hub and spoke. And especially once the FUDders came along it became important to use the proper terms.


There you go again. Such drama. 


You're the FUDder jumping from someone having 10 payment channels to "IT'S A BANK!!1!". There's a big BitTorrent uploader! "IT'S A HOLLYWOOD STUDIO!!1!"

Non-segwit nodes won't like a 2016 block reorg either.
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:35:46


Which is exactly right. Bitcoin means trustless money. Not running a full node yourself means trust. It's that simple.
That's exactly and pretty much the only thing that sets Bitcoin apart from the many other online currencies that have existed over the decades. If you don't grasp this fundamental difference, you don't walk the talk.
You can argue all day long about almost-trustless, or enough-trustless or "I don't care about trustless" or "I trust X" and that may all be true and fine, but that doesn't take away from the fact that you might one day be given a coin that later turns out to be not a bitcoin.


A couple of thousand nerd nodes, while most actual Bitcoin companies simply outsource it and use some API, is by far not that certain point.


Turned out to be impossible and doesn't exist, so the whole rest of that quote is moot. SegWit will get us a big step closer to that vision though, so maybe one day it will become reality.
So this little crusade against this Core dev only brought up points that actually reenforce his position and prove him right. You better argue for SegWit and further updates that will bring Satoshi's ideas closer to reality. Hopefully by that time there will be enough Full Nodes and safe light-weight solutions that small users can honestly say they use Bitcoin without running a full node.

Miners don't get to make demands and should certainly not be listened to our appeased. Miners do their job and listen to users. Their job is ordering transactions, only if valid according to a determined set rules, into blocks and sealing that with decentralized PoW.

You don't have to. You can let others do that for you.
Also what about that makes it a bank? Do you monitor your bank like that? No you can't even if you'd want to. So it's not like a bank at all. A bank requires your full trust. Alice doesn't require your trust at all because you she's extremely limited in the evil she could possibly do and you can monitor things to make sure she doesn't. WTF is that anything remotely like a bank? 


Since you're quoting Satoshi, I'm sure you know that Satoshi came up with the basic idea of LN and actually implemented payment channels into bitcoin himself, right?


Dude! LN is the ultimate form of p2p.


What the hell are you taking about? There's only one peer reviewed, well designed, fully implemented and tested solution in existence. It's ready and being rolled out today. Despite all the fake promises of certain parties about how easy a blocksize increase supposedly is, nobody has implemented anything at all. Every proposal is still at least a year away from being production ready and then most of those proposals would be much more complex to roll out than SegWit and thus take at least another year. 
In the meantime Ver and rbtc are actively trying to choke the actually ready solution today.


That's been clearly stated by everyone involved as clearly NOT the intent. Every detail in the design and implementations points to the opposite of your made up complaint. Also simple logic error disprove you as central hubs would require large amounts of money locked up and reduce meeting optimisations. 


Just because one node in a p2p network happens to have a few more links doesn't mean you get to call it a centralized hub. That's just drama FUD. P2P doesn't mean "one link each". "Centralized hub"on the other hand does actually mean "having a substantial significant portion of all links". One node with even a 100 links is still a far cry from that. 
And yes it makes a huge difference in what those "hubs" can learn about you or what evil things they can do and how hard it is to route around them. They learn shit about you, they can't do shit to you and you can open another channel and route around them completely.

It's not cheaper if you take the risk of losing 100% of your money into account.
So basically, I can give you one or more LN invoices and then you give me a BTC address where I deposit the correct amount and you pay the invoices.
Guess it would kind of work if you're able to build up the reputation that people will trust and come back. Similar to the reputation and trust web wallets have.
With the knowledge that the need for your service should hopefully go extinct eventually once LN is mainstream, yeah I guess maybe it could be useful for a while.

Bitcoin is already very nearly centralized right now. That makes it hardly better than paypal. Anything (other than decentralisation) that bitcoin has going for it will eventually be copied by paypal or those private blockchain companies once they find out they don't need blocks, or a chain.

i.e. maybe there's group of evil miners secretly mining since 2009 and tomorrow they will release their longer (more PoW) blockchain. Bye distributed consensus. The fact that that chance exists, no matter how tiny, proves that Bitcoin doesn't provide absolute consensus, thus not taking away anything from Greg's earlier proof.
(oooh... I can see your shifting goalposts a mile away... don't even start.)


i.e. the Nakamoto (weaker form of) consensus only has a chance of working when money is the application, not when creating a decentralized Wikipedia or hosting decentralized elections, or anything else a general consensus (which is tadah: impossible) could be useful for.

SegWit already goes to 2MB blocks. Higher even. So it would be physically impossible (well extremely silly) to do a 2MB hardfork.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:08:05


They're probably smart not to publish code that cannot be used yet because the network doesn't support it yet. In fact, trying to send SegWit transactions before SegWit activates is dangerous, so they make sure their users can't do that. Even after activation (including grace period) it's probably wise to only start slowly, which means the wallet developers doing some test transactions on the live network first. To see if everything confirms properly and there are no mutli-block forks like we had a few years ago. But after a week or so, I wouldn't be surprised if large majority of all wallet users and payment providers will at least have a realistic option to use SegWit by simply updating their software. Then it's their turn: do they want lower fees and start using SegWit or do they not care that much and just wait?
So yeah, maybe it will take a month or two to get regular 2MB blocks (under full control of the eagerness of users wanting lower fees or larger blocks). But that's perfect as it avoids a sudden shock of half-empty blocks that start filling up with low fee spam and disrupting the fee market.


Hopefully not as that would mean fungibility and uncensorability isn't perfect. Ideally transactions are completely opaque and the use case can't be distinguished at all. The sender can assign a priority to their transaction by setting the fee, but that's it. (Bitcoin isn't ideal at the moment, but let's not build on properties that are hopefully eventually going to disappear.)

Don't be afraid to ask, I find there are plenty of people willing to explain. Just be careful that a lot of them don't know what they're talking about either. A lot certainly do though and once you start getting a fuller picture of the whole thing, it will become clear who's full of shit and who really knows what they're talking about. I'll let you figure it out for yourself, but remember just like in real life: when something seems to good to be true, it probably isn't.


Only one Bitcoin? I absolutely think so. And I'm pretty sure anyone with a decent understanding thinks so too. Or maybe one major one and some stuff in the fringes.


I'm continually amazed at how long shitcoins last beyond my personal prediction of "not more than a day". I've passed on Eth pre-mine and literally all shitcoins in existance. I could have had 40x on eth alone, but it still doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Such a gain for me would have been someone else's loss. The amount of stupid money in the world is just so much larger than I could have ever imagined. And a lot of former Bitcoiners get lured into the easy money. Ver. Voorhees. Garzik. I'm going to sit it out and laugh real hard at every DAO and MtGox and BTC-e and whatever shitcoin dies next while dumping all bcash or other forkcoin I can.


That's the safe bet regarding the forks. Although my reasoning is that if it's that easy to do a hostile takeover of Bitcoin: simply a fork, then there's no reason why that fork will not itself be forked a thousand times over and it simply means Bitcoin as a whole has just failed and everything is over until the next Satoshi adds the extra missing ingredient to try again.
Good luck.

If you look at an ASIC as just a normal system but with all the unnecessary transistors ripped out, then you'll see it's always going to be faster and more power efficient which means eventually cheaper.
 Now do we want a algorithm that geniuses for a 100 years to come can study and find more and more optimizations and loopholes that at the very least obsolete previous versions into an endless cycle of newer and better go that nobody but a few big rich pools can afford to keep up with. Ending with patented ASICboost like optimisations?

No. They were volunteers and then they decided to found a company (Blockstream). Big difference. And "for-profit" is not some dirty word you can throw around to disqualify anything. Their situation is actually pretty normal in the open source world. There are also still many developers outside Blockstream. If you think not enough, you're welcome to join them or pay for another one.
And most importantly, they are under the scrutinizing eyes of thousands and thousands of researchers, volunteers, security experts, black hat hackers and anyone else interested.


No. That would be an honest altcoin (except all altcoins are scams) in the sense that it would be a new coin that would compete on its merits and have to gain trust from users before they buy into it. But knows that's a hopeless endeavor. He can never ever build something even remotely competing with Bitcoin. He wants to steal the work already done and run off with it (I don't mean just the open source software, but the community, network building, miners, brandname, publicity, etc.).
So instead he's hijacking Bitcoin itself. Saying "these pilots are shit, let me fly". Trying to stir fear, uncertainty and doubt amongst the passengers. "We're gonna crash!" "We could have been on the moon already." "I'm going to veto that engine and cargo bay upgrade." "The pilots say the cargo bay is big enough and don't ever want to upgrade it!"

SegWit is already more than 2. But a better answer is: scaling is not about a number. All possible numbers have already been mentioned and all are wrong. This whole debate is not about a number. Although most people think it is. The debate and the potential solutions are much more fundamental. It's about making Bitcoin ready for growth. Making Bitcoin ready for 2, 4, 8, 10MB.
You can wish for a car to go 200Mph, but that's not enough. It needs an engine with horse power, but before you can put in a big engine like that you need to work on the aero dynamics and the brakes and the strength of the chassis and safety equipment and tires and suspension and a shitton of other stuff. 200Mph is just a bullshit number until you fix scalability first.
The number debate is a whole differnt

So we're full circle to running your own full node. Good.


There's still and always will be a need for "enough" full nodes (without full nodes, there's no SPV either). And mining centralization concerns need to be solved first as well.
Then I won't trust Gavin anymore ever, since he's proven himself a liar and manipulator, as well as unqualified and easily fooled. But disregarding that, his BIP101 wasn't particularly good to begin with and will be completely obsoleted by SegWit.
But yes, I'll support some uncontentious hard fork to larger blocks. Hopefully some smart auto-sizing mechanism if that turns out to be possible.


Eth scales much much much worse than Bitcoin and is completely flawed to begin with. It's also not decentralized, so completely uncomparable to Bitcoin. There's no value proposition and it's inflationary. It's also a blatant scam. I'd be more worried about PayPal building something smooth and user friendly.


It's not any thinking that's preventing anything, it's math, physic, engineering and shitload of man hours and blood, sweat and tears that are required and take time. If things are too slow, you're welcome to help or step out of the way.


You mean a contentious hard fork? If it has any non-pathetic amount of followers (unlike BU+Classic+XT), it will be way more expensive than tens of millions. And depending on the outcome it will be game over for Bitcoin (and all shitcoins) entirely. A successful coup will simply prove Bitcoin to be not be an adequate solution to the Byzantine Generals problem, as it was hoped to be.


They don't. Whatsoever.


If anything even remotely like that would be required or desired of him, he'd quit Bitcoin as a failed experiment. I don't understand why you're suddenly making things personal. You're moving into rbtc conspiracy lah lah land.


I have no idea. Did the universe promise you that there must be any?
You know that wishing for things or dreaming them up doesn't make them true, right?


I don't think I did that. But dumping data on the blockchain and expecting the rest of the community to pay the price for that is not sustainable, whether the community today approves or not, eventually they won't. If that's what's happening here, then it's better to fail today instead of them wasting 10 years and then finding out.


SetWit  IS  mainnet scaling. And there's plenty more in the pipeline very soon after that. Why do you parrot such easily refuted self-contradictory bullshit? I think it's getting time you go back to flat earthers in rbtc, it's getting boring.
And that conflict of interest crap doesn't fly either. That's as lame and dishonest as accusing someone of rape. A pathetic attempt at character assasination. Especially coming from a side where chief Ver is highly invested in and actively pumping shitcoins. If you can't see the hypocracy in that shit but you dare accusing others of what you're doing yourself, then there's no point in wasting any further time on you.


self contradictory again. And false, obviously. BIP101 doesn't solve a single thing, it just postpones the misery. SegWit solves a shitload of things and as a side effect also more than doubles the block size, which is supposedly what you were after.

Real simple: centralization. Bigger blocks make things more expensive, mostly for small miners so big miners have an advantage. So big miners become bigger.
Core has been working hard and successfully at minimising those effects and SegWit is another big step in that effort. Oh and coincidentally it also increases the block size.
So what's the problem raising the block size, you ask? The people blocking SegWit, not for a single technical reason (cause none exists) but for political and vendetta reasons.

Full mesh gives shorter paths than a large hubs network. People will not want paths too short, for privacy reasons. And you're again ignoring the fact that forming large hubs is extremely expensive as it locks up shitloads of Bitcoins for hardly any gain while painting a big bullseye on your forehead as a massive target to be hacked.


Most people will never bother to change any of the default settings of a client. Aside from all the network wide incentives pointing towards peer 2 peer as much as possible, the clients will all be pre-setup to do that even more. Some nerds might change the source code and recompile to undo that latter effect, but not the former. Nor the settings on most of their peers, as they're still running stock versions.


Normally people that make such absolute predictions have done some theoretical calculations or simulations or at least have a solid explanation of incentives on why that would be the case.

There's actually no evidence for that at all. Only counter examples: They sure as hell didn't when BIP66 fork happened. And BU sure as hell didn't either in this event (and will not in the next) . It was merely outrun by honest nodes (and will be in the next).
Now what honest miners do in the time between learning a new block hash and validating a block is anybody's guess. One wild expect some sanity, but given past experience and how tricky and bug prone this sort of code is, i wouldn't hold my breath.
The only positive thing here is that thanks to hard work by Core devs the propagation and validation times have come down immensely, which takes away the incentive to do SPV mining in the first place as well as reduces the window for these problems to happen.

Sorry... I'm too chaotic.


Not sure if Satoshi described them this way. It's a relationship that can be described differently from different perspectives. But I think "employees" is a useful viewpoint in the context of power-relationship even if it might not be an exact correct analogy in other contexts. Of course there's no written employment contract and no income tax and medical insurance involved. All analogies are flawed.
But the point is that the Bitcoin users have the power to switch to another PoW algorithm if the miners do something evil. That's not done by voting per se, not decided upon in a big board meeting. It's just people voting with their money: if you're doing a bad job, I'm not using your services anymore and will go elsewhere. If the "bad thing" is really evil 100% of users will walk away, if it's less evil and only affects a minority then possibly only a minority of users will walk away. But hopefully all the other users understand that maybe today they're not the minority, but next time it might be their turn. Even the majority should feel very uncomfortable and it should make them less certain that their wealth is safe in Bitcoin.
That's one of the dangers of all the political pressure by Ver &amp; co that is trying to split the community. They're trying to make a political game out of it with promising goodies to certain parties in return for their support and trying to make compromises. Trying to drive a wedge between users and vilifying the other side.
Any rational person should become scared if their neighbor is being driven out of town just because of the color of their eyes. Today it's your neighbor, tomorrow it might be you. Bottom line: your life and wealth are not safe in this system, you will diversify and hedge your bets. Bitcoin as a whole loses.
Anyway. Maybe "contractors" or "suppliers" is a better word than "employees" for miners. They deliver a service: decentralized PoW solidifying the agreed upon consensus rules. Delivering invalid PoW blocks will automatically be rejected and they simply don't get paid. No problem there. But not doing a good job also includes:
- Not being decentralized.
- Fucking with the agreed upon rules.
One of the things that ultimately stops them from doing this is the threat of users telling them "screw you, we don't need you anymore, you can go use those ASICs as bread toasters". Another is that it would tank the Bitcoin price, but only if users persist and actually give a damn. If those users are conditioned to feel fine when their neighbors are dragged out of their house and kicked out of town then yeah.. maybe not so much.


Basically yes. All those things are a normal PC minus some parts that you don't need. By taking out the parts you don't need and optimizing the parts you do need to only do that one thing, you'll be more efficient and therefore have created an ASIC. If you don't want to include a harddisk in your definition of ASIC (because it's not technically an Integrated Circuit) then call it an Application Specific Device. Same thing.
So you might come up with an algorithm that requires every single component of a normal PC, but then you're skipping all the other properties a PoW algorithm should have: 
- Hard to create, easy to verify (if it takes me 10 minutes to verify a block, that defeats the purpose).
- Progress free: if one party can get a head start on others, or pre-calculate things then it's not fair (between miners) anymore. Every mining unit must have an equal chance of finding a block, otherwise things centralize around the people that have a higher chance.
- Fast to communicate: a block needs to propagate around the world quickly, partly to uphold the above 2 points, but also because if it takes 10 minutes to download a block it makes no sense anymore. Or if it adds 10MB of PoW-proof to 1MB of transactions.
- Preferably dedicated to the security of one chain. Chain hopping is not good for the security of any of the chains (see earlier posts). Botnets or huge companies with spare resources jumping in and out, can criple everything at no cost to them.


I'm certainly not an expert. But I've read many expert opinions on these subjects over the years. I've got a pretty good grasp (better than my ability to explain it, that's why my posts get long and convoluted) on how Bitcoin works and what's important. That said, I still encounter new insights or fresh perspectives almost daily.


The fact that it's ASICs is fine and probably unavoidable. I do think the current mining is too centralized. It would have been better if certain measures had been taken earlier. Decentralizing something that's already centralized is much harder than not centralizing in the first place. Unfortunately those measures take a lot of work and effort and understanding of the problem and willpower. Devs can only do so much.
I do have some hope that the centralization pressure is now mostly stopped and we could see a slow reversal. Hopefully ASICs become more of a commodity hardware easy to buy for anyone and with a shelf life of more than a few months.
 explains a lot of the PoW stuff and alternatives.

Except you got it completely and utterly backwards.
A bug that causes the chain to stop advancing is annoying but not unsafe at all. It's just down time. Having 2 separate chains growing in different directions, THAT is unsafe as fuck. People are guaranteed to lose money. 
Having one implementation prevents a shitload of possible scenarios where 2 chains might form. Having multiple implementations only adds risk.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:42:00
That's a big reason yeah. And no: introducing a new limit is lazy and stupid and creates technical debt that is hard to ever fix again.  It's also unnecessary because SegWit just fixes the problem completely. And it also improves performance even for small transactions by making it not squared.
Larger blocks cause centralization. Miner centralization is already terrible and needs to improve a shitload first. Larger blocks is also sorry lazy when there are many more improvement in the pipeline that make transactions smaller and other stuff more efficient. Smaller transactions is better in every imaginable way than larger blocks. Larger blocks helps nothing: bitcoin will never scale to all coffee in the world.
@_date: 2017-01-30 02:33:02
So funny how you people think if you wish hard enough you can transform bitcoin into exactly the thing you wish. Maybe your mom told you too many fairytales or something.


Why don't you go build a coin exactly to those specs then? Apart from coming up short on many important details you'd actually make a completely vulnerable and broken coin. Hint: your spec says "longest chain". Want to guess what Bitcoin does NOT do "according to your spec"?
You're full of shit professor. Wouldn't even be a problem if you had the humility to admit that and convert that in your lessons. Like a true science professor would. But it doesn't seem like you're doing that. You think you got the truth from higher up a few years ago and preaching the absolute truth.

Nah, you climbed a mountain and some bearded dude whispered you some shit which you must now spread around as gospel. Wake up already.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:51:06


Well, clearly you are missing something. Otherwise it would have been done 4 years ago. It's actually quite simple: higher blocksizes cause centralization of mining. Mining centralization is already bad, so size increases need to be done really carefully. In the meantime a shitload of work has been done to de-couple the block size from decentralization pressure as much as possible (not entirely possible). See relay network (now FIBRE network), Compact Blocks, the speedup of libpsec256k1, pruning, better caching, SegWit and many other performance and scaling improvements.


There was always a limit, although it used to be a default value that most miners didn't bother change.


Only if ALL those DOS reasons have now been fixed. Judging from the rediculous UTXO set growth caused by several DOS attacks, it's probably not fixed. In fact the only thing that can fix that is higher fees.


That's just jumping to conspiracy conclusions. No need for that.
Listen, I understand your line of reasoning because it's the first I did 2 years ago when I decided to make up my mind after 2 years of staying on the sideline. That was the bigblock argument back then: "never a limit, so hitting a limit now would be a change".
Later the same day, I was pointed to the facts that unfortunately it's not true and the limit is simply necessary right now, so no amount of wishful thinking is going to change that. As with everything Bitcoin, the devilly details often make things to be the opposite of what they appear to be at first glance.
Luckily in the meantime we have SegWit, which doubles the blocksizes. Also note that there are several further optimizations coming after SegWit that will make transactions significantly smaller (instead of blocks bigger), so that's an even better solution for everyone.
That said, there will come a day that Bitcoin will have fixed those issues and some other size increase will be necessary (it's already in the year old Core roadmap). If a hard fork is not contentious then, we could do a hard fork. If it is, we'll have to find another way.


Not really. It's just the facts. He's blocking bigger blocks, while trying to centralize Bitcoin around himself and being extremely toxic to the community and Bitcoin at large. He's also outright pumping shitcoins and brainwashing newcomers with misinformation.


Nope. Once such battles start, it's game over by definition. No more Bitcoin for the next 50 years.


So you do see through Ver's strategy: manipulating the ignorant minds of newcomers. Bombard them with misinformation, lies and propaganda. Yeah.. that's some way to win a war. Real ethical. Real convincing.
Too bad math, logic and truth eventually win out. And Bitcoin requires one to put your money where your mouth is, so a _lot_ of money is going to be lost by those poor newcomers. Unfortunately lining the pockets of mobsters like Ver.


You don't want me to leave, because if I leave it means 90% of others and 100% of devs have already left before me (because I tend to be late with everything in life). That means Bitcoin is dead.


When you kick someone out, you have one less user. And new users will see people being kicked out and think twice before coming in. Bottom line: you're fucking yourself and losing users. There's no replacing, you'll always be at least one down.

No idea what that means but sounds like a convoluted way to deny some properties of SegWit. Like those false narratives one can read on rbtc all day long.

Huge amounts of work were done on scaling before that and even during the same year segwit was worked on. By Core. Not a single line of bug free useful code by the rbtc dev-du-jour mind you.
The trajectory towards complete centralization was stopped and maybe even bent back a little. Getting bitcoin to work properly with an obviously too large blocksize for the time was a major feat. Getting ready to allow blocks to grow to 2+MB was a major feat. Or are you suggesting they raise the size first and when things go wrong only then they start fixing the loose ends?

You can already plug in an RTL USB dongle into your phone and run SDR apps right there.
If there's such demand that blocks will be streamed over GPS satellites (if that were even possible, which I highly doubt) it's a fairly small step to open up the GPS receiver to pass on the block data. Likely only some firmware and Android driver changes.

Depending on where you draw the line on what to call a payment channel, satoshi definitely had the basic idea there. Send one tx but don't dump it on the blockchain yet and then lateron you can do another payment replacing the previous tx.
Can be done without multisig of the receiver trusts the sender not to double spend and if malleability want a thing.
First putting the money in a multisig and then adding the above time lock trick solves the trust problem. Although malleability actually makes seeing it up very tricky. After SegWit that's a lot simpler.
Not sure satoshi fully realized the malleability problem at that point.
I'm not saying Satoshi's version of payment channels would have worked. Both his time locking didn't work and malleability would have screwed him over. But the idea and rough plan was definitely there and that's exactly what OP is talking about: vision.

Not at all.


The old "it will take too long for wallets to upgrade to use SegWit, and even though that's completely in users' own hands to freely choose to pay lower fees or not, we know better what's good for those damn users and we say that's not fast enough so therefore we will sabotage and delay SegWit for a year and force a dumb blocksize increase down everybody's throats" rhetoric. Well guess what, the spam attack is over so fees are very low again. Guess people won't even need the extra SegWit blocksize anymore, so maybe it will take some months to get to 2MB. You know what that would mean? It means people don't need bigger blocks. Let alone 2 within 3 months.


Not anytime soon. 4 max, but practically between 2 and 3. And then sharply reducing again after Schnorr+SA+MAST and other optimizations. Good times ahead.


Two. Within 3 months. Totally crazy.


Bullshit. Fees aren't high. And SegWit already gives that reprieve. And according to your own logic it will won't even be done yet growing that reprieve when the idiots threaten to roll out a shocking fee resetting blocksize doubling.


It's scientifically proven that that is an out of your ass lie. 


It lays nothing like that. SegWit did that already. sw8x only take away incentives for actual scaling solutions because we back to free transactions coffee on the blockchain the sky is the limit, we'll worry about it later attitude.

I agree. But one problem is that average transaction size can change to over time. And unfairly treats coinjoined transactions (larger but more efficient bundle of smaller transactions).
Which is why the earlier estimates for SegWit were around 1.7MB equivalent, but recently the estimate is more like 2.1MB equivalent.
Once it's activated it's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy in the sense that multisig and smart contract transactions enjoy the extra 3MB that SegWit allows more than tiny 1to1 transactions. So there's more room for people to do more multisig and smart contracts. 
That effect will increase a lot more after Schnorr, Signature Aggregation and MAST which all cut down on the sizes of transactions, mostly (not all) on the witness part of the transaction. 
By that time a transaction with 100 signatures and a complex script would be no larger than any normal transaction, while in today's bitcoin such a transaction would be prohibitively expensive.
It will get harder and harder to do an "equivalence" comparison. But the fact is that everybody wins as more than half of the data that is currently in the 1MB space will move away or disappear completely, so more than doubling transactions per second where the definition of "transactions" changes from "small transactions" or "average size transactions" to "any transaction, no matter how complex".

Yeah, I guess a decent metric for comparisons might be sum(inputs)+sum(outputs). Although that's a bit of a meaningless number for humans I guess.
It also doesn't take LN (or other off-chain) transactions into account (nothing does) : 1 on chain transaction may represent a million LN transactions.
Maybe in the long run it's actually a good thing that estimating the true number of transactions is hard/impossible. Makes it harder for opponents to estimate what they're up against.

Fixed some autocorrects that made it confusing.
ASIC-proof is impossible, it's always possible to design a chip/system that is a general purpose computer but with some unnecessary parts taken out.
ASIC-proof is nog even a desirable goal, as that invites botnets and viruses. And that means you always have a 51% attack looming: all the general purpose computers being turned against you (hacked/profit/forced by government/whatever).
What mining does is turning electricity into proof-of-work. The shortest, simplest, cheapest, most direct (but still non-falsifiable) method possible is what is needed there.
In reality ASIC-proof is just a nonsensical buzzword that is supposed to make a featurelist sound impressive even though it doesn't mean anything and isn't even a good thing. It sounds appealing to people who missed the "get-rich-quick-by-mining boat" (which wasn't) and want to re-run history with a new coin where they will be mining with their CPU / GPU.

I gave you plenty of examples of other things that your node does and it doesn't need to do. Those are all altruism. Protecting yourself is only one aspect of the whole P2P network and blockchain.


You may be thinking you're quoting Luke here. But you must make a distinction between the actual "physical" P2P network of computers and software and connections and bytes flowing around on the one hand and the abstract money-network layer that emerges from that. In the money layer the relay nodes are invisible but I can assure you that when China closes off their firewall completely then the relay nodes that Blockstream runs to feed their satellites are very much a requirement for the money layer to keep operating between China and the rest of the world.
The P2P network foundation must be as robust as possible and relay nodes certainly play a role in there. Ideally nodes are more than just relay nodes, but it's still great if they also perform altruistic relay tasks as well. On the other hand completely selfish nodes are fine too (and in a way even more secure), but there can not be a P2P network at all if ALL nodes are selfish. Thus altruism is certainly required.
And again: that's also why blocksizes must remain manageable: the more Terabytes the blockchain takes up, the fewer altruistic nodes are going to serve them (just one example).

Had there been a real attack by an adversary then BU would NOT have helped to protect the network. In fact they would have HELPED the attackers.
I have no idea how much hashing power is on BU but if it's for example 10% then a 51% attack on Bitcoin would actually only need (100% - 10%) * 51% = 45% where BU would have happily assisted the attacker, so the attacker would only really need to bring 35% of himself.
Doing a 33% attack would have been laughably easy where the attacker only need like 20%

Not right after a PoW change. That's a new gold rush that (hopefully) reshuffles the deck.
And even just the thread of a PoW change is power in the hands of Bitcoin users. And maybe that threat will just need to be put in practice (hopefully just once then) to make miners (and all users) actually understand that power and in who's hands it actually is. Way too many users don't even know they have that power to begin with. And merely that "not knowing" effectively hands over that power to the miners.


If you believe that, you should leave Bitcoin as the experiment is over for you. All mining will always centralize towards one guy.
Or maybe the obvious economies of scale laws don't hold all the way towards that extreme. Maybe some effects will tend towards zero or even reverse at the extreme. For example cooling: too many concentrated ASICs in one cheap building will get too hot and require cooling. Active cooling is more expensive than just opening a window.
Small effects, but maybe enough to eventually end up with 50 large miners around the world. Maybe not.
Either way, keeping the nuclear option in the hands of the users makes it a big gamble for a miner to turn evil. Not only is he risking future income, all his current investments will be worthless.


Unfortunately large miners are likely to be running more efficiently and have a bit of fat to survive periods of low prices. Thus it seems to me that tends to hurt small miners and thus decentralization. Unless I guess if the big miner took too large a gamble buying new ASICs and long term electricity deals.


A "potential PoW change" certainly. That threat must exist and is an essential part of the game theory in Bitcoin to keep miners honest. Jihan is desperately trying to wiggle himself from under that axe hanging over his head. He's trying every possible way to try to get people to believe the axe doesn't exist and at the same time buy shills to change (or replace) the Bitcoin software for him so that the axe disappears completely.


99.9% of the altcoins don't even make any sense to begin with. From Litecoin to Dash to Eth to Aurora. All based on flawed ideas at best, or outright false and scammy promises. And even ignoring that, most are not even fundamentally much different than Bitcoin (apart from the flaws) so they don't add anything.
Then I guess you could argue about Monero and ZCash maybe. I don't know if they're scams. Maybe they are, maybe they're not. If they're not, they can still turn into one. But even if not they still not backed by the amount of brainpower that Core is bringing to the table. And when I compare them to what Bitcoin will be in a few years with Schnorr and SA and MAST and LN and maybe Mimble Wimble plus the face that Bitcoin can likely integrate whatever they are doing, then I don't see them as really better. I could be proven wrong there. That doesn't mean I'm against them or don't wish them all the best (as long as they don't scam).


No, the brain power is a huge factor as well. Probably larger than the hash power.
It's like I'm coming to you to pitch an idea for an entertainment park to get you to invest in it: it's going to be as large as Texas, with roller coasters as high as the Alps and movie studios and football stadiums and a lift to the moon. Nothing exists yet, only ideas, and I'm standing there all pimplefaced holding up my hand for $100M.
Then next to me is a group of 100 different experts in many different fields, with established carreers and achievements going back decades in the applicable or related fields. They also already built Disney world and have been running it for 8 years, clearly improving and growing it continually. They also don't want your money, but if you want you can buy a ticket on the open market to both ride the park and partially own it.

If Bitcoin dies, all of crypto dies.


That's where you're completely wrong. There is basically 0 innovation happening outside Bitcoin (above Monero/ZCash exceptions may apply) and Bitcoin itself is thriving of innovation. Basically all altcoins have forked off from some now obsolete Bitcoin version and are stuck there. Some others are looping around themselves looking for a usecase for something fundamentally useless.

No, it's actually in consensus by definition. You've already agreed to it the minute you bought your first Bitcoin. Possibly before SegWit was invented. You've already agreed to it.
Satoshi put in the rules including NOPs, which together define the space of all allowable transactions. That space is ginormous and only a very very tiny corner of that space is in use today. Grown, but still tiny. Another tiny corner of that space is the one that defines SegWit transactions and blocks. All perfectly valid too according to Satoshi.
You're not going against Satoshi, are you?
Satoshi was smart. He purposely kept that space extra large. He even made it much larger by adding in those NOPs later on. That was clever. Why constrict innovation? He didn't claim to know the future, so he left options open. Very clever woman, Satoshi.
If me and my neighbour want to send SegWit transactions to each other (even today), we're perfectly in our right to do so. Satoshi permissioned us, other than that we don't need permission. Nobody can stop us. You can't stop us. That's permissionless innovation for you.
Or are you trying to censor me and my neighbor? Are you big brother that decides what transaction are or are not allowed? What do you think gives you that right? You think your huge wasteful transactions are somehow better than my much smaller and much more efficient SegWit transactions?
Why are you discriminating against light wallets, keeping them insecure? Why don't you want to help them get more security at lower (download/storage/memory/CPU) cost? You don't want to help protect the Bitcoin network against DOS attacks? Make full node operation more flexible and possibly less costly?
Well, gee... if you really want to be that guy then sure, go ahead. Keep using old transactions. I don't care. Permissionless. I wouldn't call it innovation. But you don't need my permission to keep using steam engines. Don't be surprised when the rest of the world switches to internal combustion and electric and hyper drive lateron. You can just keep chugging along in your old corner of the space, nobody will force you.

You better not mean the miners by that sentence. Miners don't pay, miners get paid. They are paid workers and they only get paid for the work that the rules of the system specify. And only if they can show Proof of that Work.
Paid workers. Workers who can be fired when they don't perform as told. No notice. No unemployment benefits. Nobody to sue. No pension. No second half market for their expensive useless chips.
We put 12.5 * $4000 on the table every ten minutes. Much more if you include fees. There will be new workers willing to do the job in an instant.


Why would it be them. Anybody can apply for the money being offered. That's the whole point.


Speaking of which. You are aware that bitcoin is software and it's not entirely finished our optimal yet, right?
That means we'll be needing updates for some time to come.
I don't see a single individual outside Core experienced and qualified and expert enough to do even minor work, let alone the big leaps that are in store for the near future. Not a single person for a job that requires many many experts openly and freely collaborating, peer reviewing ideas and inventions, implementing, reviewing and testing each others code.
If you don't like them there only one solution and that's to join them, if you got the skills.
Core is not a static group of people, it's a fluid label covering all who actually work on Bitcoin. Ironically that label was coined by Hearn and Gavin, for different and nefarious reasons, but now we're stuck with it for a while. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:30:18
Transactions pay fees and those can be converted to the currency miners pay their bills in. Bitcoiners hire miners to do one simple task, of they don't want the money they can fuck off and someone else will do the work.

Well I'm not one of them and certainly don't wish to speak for them. But I've seen nullc speak about this before: one of the problems is that people read these announcements to be finished products and then become impatient when it's not released feeling there are delays and nothings happening. And then when it finally gets released people are bored and unexcited because it's months old news and they're disappointed because one of the "promised" features didn't make it in last minute, or the first version of the promise made it sound way cooler and better than the accurate more verbose finished version. And in the meantime centralized scammy dev teams can put on a well timed and paid for road show, media attention and full steam propaganda factory to drown out the good news with their own false promises, lies and fud.
Personally i have no problems these announcements. They're nice summaries of what's likely the pipeline and i know it's months till get there. I guess most people aren't used to open source let alone decentralized open source.
Another thing is decentralization: it makes it hard to claim something is decentralized when there are back room deals where road maid and release dates are decided. Everything should be wide open as much as possible. It's nothing compared to sw8x but slippery slope and principles matter.
I don't know. I guess it's impossible to stop these kinds of reddit posts anyway. Even if we'd convince all the good guys, the trolls would just take over. Maybe they should put a big disclaimer on documents like these (they probably have and i didn't even read it).

I've never understood how there can be more losses, that just sounds like a badly designed matching engine. 
They should have "hidden" buy orders for every sort position at exactly the price that the user can cover. Those orders should get priority and match first. (I guess they have this.) On top of that they should have a check where they make sure all those hidden orders are always covered on the sell side. As soon as a replace or delete is issued to a sell order that would leave the hidden order uncovered then that sell is executed instantly (not replaced it deleted). That's the moment of liquidation.

Except for segwit which has the beautiful property that it lets users decide whether they think it's worth it to use or not. Therefore the hard 1MB limit can stretch to roughly double the size entirely at a pace that users want. Not decided by Core devs, not by miners, not by Gavin and not by (Roger Ver). Purely by users. Ultimate democracy.
That should provide nice data on how much true demand there really is for block size.

No, it's much more. If Bitcoin can be hijacked by pushing through a hard fork then everything is lost and the Bitcoin experiment is dead. This time it's me (and 99% of others, but maybe you think I'm alone, irrelevant), next time it's another hard fork that will fuck you in your ass. Or the next. Or the next. Bottom line: nobody is safe anymore. Nobody can invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin fundamentally worthless. Simple.
But even simpler and more obvious: SW2x does not have any devs behind it that have the slightest clue what they are doing. Track record proven by the graveyard of buggy junk. SW2x will crash and burn at the first slightest bump it encounters and even if it doesn't it will never be updated with actual features anymore. It's simply stillborn and pointless.
I'm sorry that you're blind to reason and gullible to false promises of golden unicorns, but after many years of this fake nonsense we've simply had enough of the excuses and FUD. Bitmain wants sw2x because it gives them a cover to continue using ASICboost and it puts everyone who's against ASICboost out of the game. Every single "bussiness" on the list of SW2x supporters is bought or invested into by Bitmain. We're not falling for this bullshit. It's not going to happen.
sw2x doesn't bring a single positive change at all, nothing we need that sw on its own doesn't already achieve, so it's completely pointless to even think about it.

In general I would agree that some swap should be helpful. And even in this case he might save a big of memory by having parts of the kernel and OS being swapped out. But I'm guessing that bitcoind itself is so memory intense with almost all the memory it uses, that swap is only going to slow that down. I could be wrong, but it sounds like they've optimized memory usage quite a bit, not leaving many chunks unused.
Anyway, I would indeed still advice to have a few hundred MB of swap in his case.

1. FlexTrans is utter shit that makes transactions and bitcoin LESS flexible. It's also a hard fork, although the scammer trying to push it doesn't understand that himself yet. It's also part of BU, who have proven themselves complete retard amateurs many many times over the year+ with bugs and security holes all over the place. Even replacing all of the idiots with skilled developers and it would still take at least 2 years to get something safe and working out of it. And then it will still be fundamentally worse than SegWit.
2. Nobody will make LN work on FlexTrans. Those devs aren't stupid. And the stupid BU devs wouldn't have the skills even with 99.9% already done.
3. SegWit isn't ill conceived. You got scammed and brainwashed by lying idiots.
4. Every second you block LN, you push more people into the hands of Coinbase and other fully centralized OFF chain solutions. That is your style.

You keep handing me arguments that prove you wrong. Quite funny actually.


The nodes you connect to. Look around for a screenshot where Peter Todd sends 22M bitcoins to his phone.
As I've already pointed out to you: SPV doesn't work like described in the white paper. Not by a longshot actually. There's a lot of trust and opportunities for MITM and Sybil attacks involved. It could have worked slightly better if the big guy behind the SPV library (Mike Hearn) hadn't actively opposed even the simplest extra precautions/sanity checks.


Wanted maybe. But it turned out to not work. Repeat: his idea was flawed.
He also wanted to scale through payment channels (i.e. Lightning Network), but guess what? His implementation was flawed there too. Didn't work.
But guess what? After several years, other smart people came up with ways to fix his flaws. And now, after several more years of hard work, we're on the brink of a major breakthrough that will let payment channels work even better than he imagined and will get us a huge step closer to the SPV that he wanted.
"Want" doesn't make things reality. You need math that checks out and then add shit ton of work too.


I've already debunked both your points in my previous post. Here to be exact: 
Why are you repeating them verbatim?


Private key is only one way to lose your money. Quite unlikely thiefs will even bother trying (if you don't screw up your random number generator or R values). Maybe a few hardened criminals or governments would try to torture the private key out of you, but most would take way simpler routes. And guess what blocks most of those simpler routes? Hint: not SPV.


Mac or Windows are supported just fine too. Although keeping private keys on a Windows machine is quite questionable.


And that's the problem and certainly not a reason to drive those people out until we're left with 10 nodes.


You're playing games and being dishonest about the exact context in which he said this. As I've pointed out already.
And yeah... sugar coating means he was making it sound easier than it actually is. Maybe he meant "eventually in 30 years".
Also, please point out one single one of those "specialists with server farms of specialized hardware" that would be worthy of our trust? They don't exist. Let alone enough so that I can stop running my full node.
And again: that paragraph of Satoshi starts with SPV, so as long as SPV doesn't exist, the whole paragraph is moot. So obviously we're not "beyond a certain point" yet. (I feel I keep repeating myself, are you even reading any of this?)

He probably was. The block was invalid the moment it was created. It never had more than zero chance of ever being accepted. Consensus for that fact was established since Satoshi introduced Bitcoin. That consensus did not need to emerge. The rules were there all along. This block didn't follow the already established rules.


The kind of consensus you're thinking of didn't even come into play here. The consensus you're thinking of only picks between alternative VALID chains. This chain was never valid and their want even considered.


You got it backwards. Other miners decide to ignore it because it was invalid. Ban those peers even. 
This is a small but important difference that is actually at the core of why BU is completely flawed and retarded.


No. All Litecoin blocks are invalid Bitcoin blocks. There's no point in trying to send them to bitcoin nodes.
The rules that Satoshi laid out are what defines what Bitcoin is. Anything not valid according to those rules is not bitcoin. A priori. No amount of hash power either way changes that.

So he says. But his actions prove otherwise.


The only scaling forces is the world are the Core devs. They have the only working, implemented, peer reviewed and tested design available in the world. Others have literally nothing after years of shouting how easy their solution was. Literally nothing.


By definition of decentralized nobody has direct power. But it's clear that Ver is trying to maximise his indirect or by controlling media, brainwashing noobs, roundabout lying, threatening, bribing and corrupting.
The only power Core has is doing actual work. And in practice that means of they don't do it there's nobody in the world capable of doing it and bitcoin will be dead.


It's called the scaling roadmap, you might make less of a fool of yourself if you Google it. It's more than a year old already.

@_date: 2018-10-05 00:05:32
You may accept a 0-conf "transaction" but if it gets double spent then it's not your money. The transaction that you "accepted" is no longer a valid bitcoin transaction. Calling it instant is deceiving.


"well behaving" is not defined. Is a miner that simply accepts the transaction with the highest fee not well-behaving? Is he not allowed to take the money that's being offered for his services? Says who? If not, then Bitcoin is doomed and we may as well quit today. And at the same time if everybody was well behaving then we wouldn't need a blockchain at all.
Fact is an attacker needs only one or a few non-well behaving nodes to get a pretty decent chance at doing the double spend. And if he's a bit clever he doesn't need any at all. If a "well behaving" node doesn't see the first transaction then it will simply accept the 2nd one and don't even know he's not "well behaving".


Also, that's wrong: if I flag my transaction with RBF then it specifically means that it will be allowed to be replaced lateron by a higher fee. But nothing about that flag can be enforced and is in many ways unpredictable/unreliable. There are plenty of nodes on the network that don't live by those RBF "rules".


There are many tricks to prevent the first transaction to getting to many nodes, so then the 2nd transaction will be seen as being the first by those nodes. Many people have shown this to be easy and with high success rates. For example Peter Todd. The fact that it doesn't happen very often in practice is partly because shop owners aren't stupid and only accept 0-conf for low price items, plus they usually see people face to face and may have cameras and the police to fall back on. They may just accept a reasonable risk just like they risk customers doing a chargeback on their credit card or walking away without paying for their beer. A few (targeted or not) attacks will very quickly change the owner's mind though.
Selling the technology as safe and instant is very dishonest and it also leads to idiots who think 0-conf is safe now and then when the protocol gets updated such that they feel 0-conf becomes less safe (rightly so or not) they start spreading FUD and rioting in an attempt to block the update. Bcashers are well known such idiots.
0-conf bitcoin transactions will become pointless anyway: fees (especially compared to lightning) will be such that nobody will use bitcoin (on chain) for small purchases and shop owners will not accept the risk for large purchases.

That's one reason. Probably not the most important.


I don't care much about people getting their PC hacked. But if that affects me because now I get an increase in spam (old days) or because my ASIC proof blockchain network is getting 51% attacked (hypothetically today) then it does affect me.
CPU / GPU mined coins have nicely proven that general purpose mining is bad. Recently Ethereum mining dwindled as miners jumped to Monero or Zcash or whatever. That not only meant a huge reduction in security for Eth, it actually proved that Eth was always insecure to begin with. That threat had been looming forever, the only reason it didn't happen earlier was because Eth mining was more profitable than other shitcoins. All other CPU/GPU coins have shown the same for years now: miner hop from coin to coin whatever gives the most profit. ASIC proof mining means a coin loses a huge chunk of hashing power every time the price dips.
Bitcoin instead has miners that are invested more long term and can't go anywhere else (apart from turning off or downclocking their machines).


That's why I said the algorithm be as simple as possible. Simple chip design. No patents. Everybody can walk up to a chinese chip factory, give them the design and get chips. Same for the boards.
If mining a CPU/GPU coin becomes profitable enough then someone will make an ASIC, defeating the whole ASIC-proof point but also creating a monopoly for himself: he can push all other miners out and it's much more expensive for competition to also build those ASICs.
Note that Bitcoin skipped all those problems because there was no real competition yet from other coins and everything was new and unknown. Any new coin will have a hard time getting through that baby stage (I'd argue it's neigh impossible actually) and that's why they resort to deceitful marketing and/or outright scams.


That's the marketing idea. And at first glance it might sound plausible. But the above points (and I'm probably missing some more) make it not so.
It's actually surprising often the case in Bitcoin that something seems simple and pointing one way at first glance, but with further scrutiny the effect is actually completely opposite. That's one reason why the whole block size debate is so confusing to newcomers. And it's what scamcoiners live off of: technobabble that sounds nice but actually makes no sense at all. (Whole of Ethereum fits that description btw.)

Can't find it right now. It's probably 3 years ago and I propable misremembered the exact number of bitcoins, so it's hard to google.


That's because you're trusting that it's connecting to some central full node that you hope you can trust because you hope you can trust the developer.


Sure they can. They can partition you off the network, by MITM or Sybil and tell you anything they want. But again: I'm repeating myself.


Twice already. That "method of scaling" hinges on SPV. SPV doesn't exist (yet). Ergo that "method of scaling" is totally irrelevant until SPV becomes a reality. 
Seriously! 3 steps of kindergarten logic.


How is that Bitcoin's problem? Who the fuck cares? If OpenBazaar screwed up their design, go complain to them. If the shop owners are whiny bitches, go complain to them. It's one of those two and neither has anything to do with Bitcoin.


They were warned 4 years ago that assuming the blockchain is free storage is not a good business model. Nor is depending on free transactions. SN put in fees and an exponentially decreasing block subsidy for a reason.
But again: there are people working hard towards getting SPV a reality so that Satoshi's method of scaling may become a reality as well as doubling the block size as well as introducing LN as well as scaling Bitcoin in the dimensions that really matter, like performance, in preparation for further blocksize increases. And here you are, complaining that impossible things don't exist yet and that certain people took the wrong business decisions and are now stuck with a shitty product. WTF?


Good to know that I'm wasting my time.


Not my plan. I'm nobody. It's the plan of the smartest heads with decades (some personally) of experience in this field. The people that have worked relentlessly as volunteers on this free open source software project. All the while being under attack by all kinds of assholes.


I've explained you numerous times already that these people are working towards achieving "SN's plan". SN left with loose ends and half finished implementations that he had to revert because they turned out to be broken or even vulnerable. Core are working hard to re-introduce those exact (and improved/fixed/modernized) features so that people like you can claim that Bitcoin can scale through SPV.
If you're too impatient you have two options: help out by working on solutions or paying others to do so. There's plenty more room for more smart developers or documentation writers or testers or whatever you can think of. That's what open source free software means.
People that think they can enslave others to do their bidding can simply GTFO.

I think we agree on payment channels. It's just that a few posts up the talk was about the vision of one of the ways Satoshi envisioned scaling: adding a caching system/payment channel was clearly in his mind even though he didn't have the details right and it took many years and a lot of hard work to get those details in place.


Because it's tricky to open a channel without problems of one side being able to keep the money hostage until the timeout expires. If send send to a multisig address I first demand from you a signed redeem transaction that sends 100% back to me. When i have your transaction i can safely send mine to the blockchain so the money is now locked in that multisig. Sounds perfect until you start considering malleability: if a malleated version of my transaction hits the blockchain then the redeem transaction that you have me is now invalid so i can't get my money back (until the timelock express on the multisig).
There are complex method around this problem that increase transaction sizes and in not even sure it's 100% perfect then.
This is one of the reasons why LN devs said "we can do it without SegWit but we're not going to bother because it would just be insane." Makeshift also enables some other extremely cool features for LN (trustless efficient and almost out perfect 3rd party channel monitoring).

Code defines the system called Bitcoin. Within that system, that code is law.
Social consensus is outside that system and merely defines the size of that system in term of number of users. You're free to go use another coin and live by other laws but then you're not using Bitcoin.
Code is law. Don't let Eth and BU shills tell you otherwise. Bitcoin is not a democracy or a vote amongst miners. The code running on the user's computers is law.
"Code is law" already captures your social consensus. The consensus is defined by what code users run on their computer. My code defines my law and as long as enough people run the same laws then that code is the law for a whole system.
Code is law.
SegWit is relatively not that complex compared to many other changes already done and considering all the fixes it combines. Doing all those fixes separately would have been much more complex (if not impossible) and doing any of those fixes (or the blocksize increase) through a hard fork would have been crazily more complex as well as impossible in the current climate.


Now you're making up words.


With SegWit miners aren't forcing us anything. WTF u taking about? Without consent? If miners activate SegWit and nobody uses it, nothing happens. You're completely free to change nothing and keep using old transactions and even an old node. If you turn it to be the lone non-user then it's certainly not the miners fault. That's just idiotic. Or are you now back to claiming to know what's good for other users and are therefore forbidding then to use SegWit transactions?

Transactions can actually reference inputs that are not (yet) in any block at all. Some smart contracts or other advanced use cases require making transactions that are not immediately (or maybe never) confirmed in a block, while they're already being build upon by child transactions. So there is no blockhash or even heigh known yet.
LN for example does this.

What makes you think the roadmap changes every few months. The last "official"long term roadmap is from January i think. It had the main points of what has been implemented throughout this year on it and so has some outstanding further planned points. But apart from details now being filled in, the rough outline has been spoken about and promoted for many many years now by mostly the same people. It's true that back then there were people countering those ideas with very different ideas of their own, some good ideas, some bad ideas. That's one reason why it took so long: the bad ideas had to be filtered out, people needed to be persuaded by the good ideas, the good ideas needed to be improved, the details needed to be worked out and the different components needed to be prioritised as many good ideas depended on other good ideas to be finished first.


I've named several other channels in my previous post. And i forgot about github there as well as conferences and many talks (recorded on YouTube).
I don't think the problem is not enough openness or lack of communications. Your problem seems to be there is too much. The added misinformation, lies and deliberate FUD added by trolls organised by Ver and others certainly don't help there.
What you are looking for a small daily/weekly/monthly summary. I'm sorry there's not anything exactly suitable to your wishes and level of technical understanding. Everybody will be different there in the amount of time they want to spend and the technical level suited for them.
I guess i can recommend the blog posts on bitcoincore.org, the IRC logs, asking questions on bitcoin.stackexchange.com, any journalistic articles by Aaron and Kyle, hang around on  IRC,  
Stuff like that. Pick and choose to your level of detail.
Remember Core is just a name for the combination of a number of individuals. It's not one coherent group. They don't have (can't have) a PR department.


That's simply an outcome of healthy scepticism on a platform rife with scams (the internet) surrounding a topic attracting the most scammers (money). I simply can't justify spending time on each claim and giving it the benefit of the doubt. So far not a single project has floated to the surface that i can honestly consider not a scam. Some may still be beneath my radar, so who knows. If it ever does it still has a minute chance of surpassing bitcoin as it's good posts will likely be integrated into Bitcoin anyway.
Also be wary of people claiming to be the one true followers of some vision. Battlefields throughout history are riddled with their and their victims corpses.
All claims to Satoshis vision by BU are fallacies built on misquotes and misinterpretations of what satoshi said and did.
And even if it weren't lies: they have produced nothing after more than a year of promises and empty talk. Testnet blew up, their code is not peer reviewed, riddled with security bugs and DOS vulnerabilities, they actually busy ripping large parts of the code they made out again because of that. Returning them to the original squared hashing problem. In the meantime they don't even have the capability to keep up with simply pulling in fixes and updates that Core has made. They can't keep up copy/pasting work already done by others!
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:16:04


As long as it's not false promises that are being made to those people (for example a lot of people seem to have been promised free transactions, or get-rich-quick because in 5 year the whole world will only use Bitcoin). As Bitcoin wasn't ready for larger blocks at the time, there's not much you could have promised newcomers, not more than they're getting now anyway.


Here you need to be careful. It sounds true, but it's kind of irrelevant. Once you're a miner you have a choice of adding a 0.0001 cent transaction which would cost you nothing and gives you more than 0. If blocks are not full every transaction with &gt;0 fee is extra income for the miner, he'd be stupid to not include it.
Any counter argument to that that says "but he risks his block being orphaned" directly proves the biggest problem: that risk is only relevant for small miners, big centralized miners don't have that risk.
Another point is that the "cost of adding more transactions" is tiny (practically 0) for miners, but not for every other full node on the network. They need to store history, process, validate, download/upload all those transactions and don't get compensated for any of it. It's like paying $100 to a city official and then dumping toxic waste into a lake, thinking you've paid your dues.


Also false for the above reasons. Plus it would only hold true for the one miner with the largest resources: if he can make 40MB blocks and others can only handle 30MB he has a mechanism (and incentive) to push the others out.


Not entirely true. The limit used to be a lot lower 250KB, 500KB, 750KB. They were not hard limits, but in practice miners mostly adhered to them (block reward was plenty high anyway), causing the same effect from a users perspective. But yes, there was hardly a fee market and although a backlog has always existed, the fees fairly insignificant.
It's a slow natural transition that comes with going from a fixed 50BTC per block to only fees per block. There's a lot of gray area and room for discussion on the speed of different aspects of that process. But slow, steady and data-based seems seems better than let's party and let the next generation worry about it.
In the end we're now getting what people have been wanting for 3 years now: larger blocks in a safe manner. Even in hindsight nothing could have been ready like half a year ago or so. So worst case people have had to wait an extra half year... Doesn't sound like something to lose sleep over. So anyone still whining and crying today has other motives. And those people are about to be flushed. Hard.

Impossible in the context of you FUDding that it would spontaneously accidentally happen. You had no reason to say that, because it's bullshit, other than to confuse people about SegWit. That makes you a lying manipulative sack of shit. Which is standard operating procedure for rbtc, I know, no surprise there. You can play semantics all day, but it's a simple fact that you were FUDding and I disproved your FUD. For your target audience, the average Bitcoin user, your scenario was completely impossible and even to Bitcoin experts it's completely irrelevant as malconfigured miners are simply not miners anyway.


Nope. It allows bigger blocks. So by definition not fully validating. Block size is part of the consensus rules. BU makes it a huge flashing neon sign: "Want to attack the Bitcoin network? You can partition me off the network and reduce the total hash power. Simply give me some large blocks!" Thank you very fuck for your help in securing the Bitcoin network but stabbing it in the back at the exact moment that it really matters. That is during an attack.
That something hasn't happened yet does not mean 


You're not fully validating the same rules. Therefore you're not fully enforcing the Bitcoin consensus. That statement is true regardless of whether the exception happened yet or not.


Nodes mining invalid blocks are not Bitcoin miners. They have nothing to do with Bitcoin. To Bitcoin, they're just as relevant as a Litecoin miners. So if you want to play semantics it's actually impossible to mine an invalid block and call it a Bitcoin block. Checkmate.


No, mister know-it-not-all. "The network" is the Bitcoin consensus rules. Anything not complying to that is completely ignored, i.e. "kicked off". If individuals want to run a different network with their own rules, then they can do so. Is not Bitcoin no more.


Now you're jumping from invalid block to magically valid block, mined by a malicious miner no less.

You were not arguing that inflation was the problem you were saying you don't care if there's a massive collapse when the inflation stops. Massive sudden collapse is a whole different thing than gradual inflation. Especially when the upcoming collapse is known in advance, then nobody will want to touch those doomed coins long long before the collapse.
All currencies are like throwing around hot potatoes, but USD is generally considered less hot than the Zimbabwean dollar. Want to guess why? That doesn't mean the USD won't collapse tomorrow, but it does mean that (most) people don't know about that yet and consider the risk relatively low.

I doubt that.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:24:35


Eh yes it did, does and will. See below for your misunderstanding.


You got that backwards a bit. Malleability is NOT a problem for transactions that have been confirmed in a block. After confirmation, there not malleable anymore. Only unconfirmed transactions suffer from Malleability. Because the transaction ID (hash) does cover the signatures but signatures can be malleated while remaining valid signatures, thus changing the transaction ID.
Within a block though the whole transaction is covered by ultimately the Merkle root hash. Including after SegWit, although the witness data will then be covered by a different path of the Merkle tree+further hashes.
Bottom line: changing a single bit anywhere in any confirmed transaction will invalidate the block.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:05:39


Sounds honest. That's good.
I'm not seeing any decline. In price, one may well come as it has many times before after a jump up. But even that seems less likely by the day. Maybe if some big shock happens again comparable to MtGox going under.On the technical side there's hardly anything that can go wrong or even be as bad as the SegWit blockade. It's clear waters from here for a while, things merely need time and hard work.


Nothing. You seem to think this field is brand new and people have only started to think about these things in the last 2 years or so. The fact is that this field is many decades old and most of these ideas have long been considered and researched and abandoned. Further you don't see through the empty promises of golden rainbows. It's all snake oil and smoke and mirrors to obfuscate how the thing actually works. Random nobodies that claim to have the solution to a problem many decades of experts couldn't think of: and that answer is "sharding" or "masternodes"... don't be gullible.


It's a fundamental problem for a reason. And Eth hasn't moved yet, despite many promises, for that same reason. Although I don't doubt they will change to an unsound smoke and mirrors PoS solution at some point anyway.


Core can't fire anyone. This is a decentralized system.


Maybe. Maybe not. So far he's raked in possibly hundreds of millions extra with asicboost and delaying SegWit.


Apparently it was controversial, although I don't know the details about that and I'm also disappointed that Bitcoiners let themselves be buttfucked like that. Seems mostly because of the FUD, brainwashing and shilling by rbtc and other puppets. It was also a timing thing though, 


They have. Also after July. It can't be a BIP yet because it's impossible to decide yet which algorithm to use next, otherwise some people can get a head start on producing ASICs.

I don't see an argument that disputes my claim. I repeat: attacker could have forged this exact block and then BU miners would have happily built on top of that block making the attacker chain longer. Giving SPV and BU nodes the impression there are multiple confirmations. That is precisely assisting the attacker.
BTW: And this is also exactly the point when people say alternative clients decrease security instead of the more intuitive and often claimed increase in redundancy.
One reference client is what is needed. Anything more is a pure waste of hashing power, at best.

The universe doesn't give a rat's ass about what you think should or shouldn't be. That's how the math works, there's no point in complaining to me. This is well studied stuff, even long before Bitcoin came to be.


Sentence does not compute. But whatever. Core is working hard to split off the consensus code into a library called libconsensus. Because of the way Bitcoin was originally built (in a time when nobody really knew which part was actually consensus critical and which wasn't) it's a shit load of work to do that. But a lot of progress has been made over the years. You're welcome to help if your complaint is that it's not going fast enough.
With proper use of libconsensus, every half ass idiot can go create their "implementation" and all will be fine. Some can focus on better wallets, prettier GUIs, archival nodes, mining nodes, payment processors, whatever.
But that's not what today is understood by "alternative implementations", since libconsensus isn't finished yet. We were clearly talking about BU/Classic/XT (outright evil) and a few other alternative clients (although those aren't evil as far as I can tell, they're still added risk if people use them).
3) That's just nonsense. But as the math shows there's no alternative, so you'll just have to live with it. Maybe you can come up with other methods to avoid such group think.

This pocketed Jihan on the order of 100M$ per year as well as pushed out competing miners causing huge centralization. And it's the reason why he's sabotaging anything that threatens (knowingly or unknowingly) to take away that unfair advantage. From delaying SegWit to creating fork chains on which he can keep using the advantage even after it finally becomes impossible on bitcoin itself. Even if those forks fail to replace bitcoin, as long as they longer like Eth Classic does, Jihan will be the sole miner on there as he controls the profitability  through difficulty adjustments while profitability for other miners is 30% lower.

People won't update fast... people need it NOW!
So which is it? Do people need the extra space or not? Are you deciding they need it, or are you going to let them decide for themselves? You're deciding they need it so badly that risking Bitcoin as a whole is worth it. But at the same time you're saying they'd not even take the effort of doing a simple update of their wallet (for most phone wallets it's actually hard to prevent an update as it's automatic).
And at the same time you're silent about the fact that any alternative does not exist, not even in design stage and is at least a year development, peer-review and testing plus another year of rolling out.
And you're silent about further updates that SegWit enables that will increase transactions per block further. Schnorr, SA, MAST and others.
And you're silent about LN.


And you don't know what the word scaling means.


As does everything else. Except SegWit actually opens up new roads for future updates.


False too. If i use SegWit, I free up blockspace for you too.


Which is good, as a sudden empty blocks will reset fees to zero and we have to start over again.


SegWit+Schnorr+SA+MAST will likely allow at least that much transactions per block equivalent by then.
So in short, you've proven you don't understand jack about SegWit, just parrotting falsehoods. Furthermore, you're trying to force people to do something they, by your own words, don't want. Which is bad enough in the normal world, but doubly ironic in a decentralized system.
Oh and do you have a pull request? No, didn't think so. So at the same time, you're trying to enslave volunteer developers to do all the hard work to get your braindead solution pushed down everybody's throats. In the meantime, I bet you're one of those hypocrites who thinks devs have too much power.

He didn't just say "I tested one aspect and that went fine, let's now investigate other problem points", he said "I fully tested this, everything is fine, let's do this right now". BIG difference. In fact, he's still saying that same shit today with his rediculous comparison of block size to web page size. Yes, he said 20MB with a ridiculous ramp up to 20GB. Both numbers completely and equally bonkers, especially 2 years ago when he said it.
2. Sigh. Too much rbtc poop up your nose. Went to your brain. Money requires trust, if you buttfuck 30% of your community you don't get trust and you don't have money. And being a complete retard but thinking that by just convincing 70% of the ignorant populace with bribes, empty promises and threats is going so somehow make you right and come to better decisions than science... Fucking facepalm.
3. Blahblahblah... the excuses you make for some who was obviously bamboozled and even admitted it (pretty much the only thing he ever admitted being wrong on), just to uphold your fallen hero is pathetic. If only you made a tenth of those excuses for people that actually do some work and achieve things, the whole block size charade would have long been over and solved.


If only you could build the most security sensitive application imaginable on beliefs and wishes and reasonable but factually false conclusions. Oh wait, that's exactly what rbtc numpties think is possible.


It's a defense against him attacking and undermining Bitcoin. He's long been irrelevant in any other capacity.


He should be ashamed. He had plenty of opportunity to accept the evidence that he was wrong in everything he said and make place for smarter people to take over.
And even worse: you and your rbtc crew should be ashamed of pissing on those smarter people that have actually been the only ones in the world to do the hard work of making progress on scaling instead of protecting long lost losers that only shout long debunked empty promises but produce nothing.

@_date: 2017-01-08 23:53:54


That's why I specifically didn't say that at all, cause I knew you'd whine about it. I said: 




False. Again. You do have to pay for that part of the block too. That part is bigger, so it's likely to be cheaper. Wow, Amazing. Shocking!


Depends. If the receiving node is interested in it. Light nodes may only be interested in the witness data paying to themselves. And even full nodes may chose to not download witness data older than a year or so when they are doing an Initial Block Download. Just like currently full nodes don't verify old signatures to speed up the IBD. Notice how I just sneaked in yet another big advantage of SegWit: it allows for almost-full nodes. Which is a big step up towards what Satoshi initally described in his white paper as SPV nodes. SPV nodes currently actually don't exist at all, despite people calling them that. Current "SPV" wallets heavily trusting the node they're connecting to which is easily MITMed or Sybil attacked. Yet another one of those things Satoshi thought of and wanted, but bothced the implementation which we now have the chance to correct and go forward with.


I'm not dismissing anything, I'm just pointing out you don't know what you're talking about and are making decisions and misleading other people based on that. That what you call semantics are actually details. And details happens to be extremely important in Bitcoin because if you handwave away details and only look at the rough edges, you completely miss how Bitcoin works and can come to completely opposite conclusions.


It bloody certainly is.


It is. But there is a "discount" if you insist on keep using that word. It's not actually a discount as devs don't have any power to set the price either way, miners and users together decide the price.
Another misconception you should drop asap "bytes" are the be all end all for fees. Some bytes are more costly to the Bitcoin system as a whole than other bytes. Signature data is less costly because in a lot of situations it can be skipped (see above) or even pruned away completely. And even if it is used, it's only checked once and then stored on disk and forgotten about. The actual transaction data ends up in the UTXO set which needs to be kept in memory, efficiently indexed for fast lookup. Pre-segwit has a problem (incentive bug) where all bytes are equally expensive. But if you think about it: spending a UTXO needs a signature, while creating a UTXO needs much less bytes (just a hash basically). Spending an output cleans up the UTXO set (the expensive in memory thing) while creating an output pollutes it further. So wallets were incentivized to create more outputs because then the transaction is smaller and thus the fee is lower. Cheaper for the user (short term) but heavier for the whole network.
In SegWit removes the block size limit and replaces it with a block weight limit of 4 million (not bytes). Weight is measured as: 1 x signature bytes + 3 x other bytes. All bytes do count, but the bytes that are more of a burden on the network weigh more. This realigns the incentive bug to make spending and creating a UTXO roughly the same weight. That's the "discount". A fix for a crooked misalignment of incentives that Satoshi may or may not have realized existed, but didn't really have a way to fix himself.
In the end current limit is 1MB and SegWit increases that to 4MB max, but in practice roughly 2MB (not counting the future improvements or changes in usage patterns). So in practice everybody gets a 50% discount in fees (or twice as many transactions or whatever equivalent manner you want to look at it). Multisig or smart-contract transactions with more signature data do get a bit more discount compared to today, but NOT at the expense of others. They push the 2MB higher, but don't push out other transactions.
LN open and close transactions are multisig, but as soon as Schnorr is rolled out, 2 sigs will be combined into one and they'd be almost exactly like normal transactions. MAST would make them completely indistinguishable. So even if you would want to stretch reality all the way to say LN transactions benefit from SegWit discount disproportionally, then that's only temporary as a year later that difference will disappear as (all) transactions will become smaller and equal-size.


In rbtc both don't matter at all depending on which way the wind is blowing. "3TB harddisk costs $50!" "1Gbit bandwidth is cheap!" "Moore's law!"
Fact: SegWit is a big block size increase as a side effect of several bug fixes, super cool performance enhancements and new features that were already in the works for years but seemed almost impossible to actually implement. And it's completely backwards compatible, nobody needs to update in a hurry. And it's ready today.
Meanwhile rbtc has produced literally nothing but screams of how easy changing one constant is supposed to be (but even that is nowhere near a finished product) and other lies and FUD confusing the hell out of people like you.

i.e. peer to peer. As decentralized as universally possible.


That doesn't reduce the decentralization at all. The fact that you can do the monitoring yourself actually confirms the decentralization.


I didn't read the FAQ but I'm pretty sure it doesn't say that. Monitoring services are not centralized. Plus mining services get the absolute minimum in privacy or identity information. Which means none at all, unless they actually have to close the channel.


Ver is the one doing that. 2+MB is ready for users to start using. Nothing else is less than a year away from being fully implemented let alone be rolled out and activated.


Very false statement, makes no sense whatsoever. You've been clearly lied to.
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:05:48


And that's what LN does. You don't just give money to a middle man and then ask them to give it to the next. LN makes a party to the network where money flows from one end to the other end. Atomically! That means it either successfully goes through all the way or it fails and nothing happens. All or nothing. 
Or are you going to argue that BitTorrent is audio not peer to peer because there are multiple routers and switches in between me and my peer?
If i talk to you face to face it's not peer to peer either because there's a few air molecules in between that act as middlemen?


Sigh. So not only do you not understand LN, you also don't get segwit at all. Fact: everybody gets more space for their transactions. Even clients that don't update to segwit themselves get more space because others are using less space. 


There's no such distinction at all. You've got it completely wrong. Old and new transactions are not split up. I seriously can't understand where you'd get false information like this. You read a few posts (likely in a cesspool like rbtc) and then you imagined how it might work and are now assuming that's the truth? 


Get with the time instead of using year old estimations. It's 2+. And likely more as usage patterns change. And transactions per block will increase again by further updates that segwit allows: Schnorr, Signature Aggregation and MAST to name a few.


And again a total misunderstanding of how it works.
You don't seem to understand at all that SegWit segregates the WITNESS data. It doesn't segregate transactions! It segregates a PART of a transaction namely the WITNESS part. That fact alone completely invalidates everything you've said about SegWit so far.

A miner can reduce cost by downtuning his ASIC to run on a lower frequency, thereby using less energy per hash.
That makes less sense for an attacker, cause he'd have to buy more equipment to get to his target percentage.
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:31:52
There'd need to be a pressing issue in the first place. There wasn't and there still isn't today. But we'll see how quickly SegWit gets activated and then how quickly people will start using SegWit transactions: that's a nice datapoint correlated to (among other things) how strongly people really want and need it.
The problem with postponing fixes is that the fix actually becomes even harder or impossible. Doing a workaround today, may require a hard fork to get rid of the workaround again tomorrow. Not to mention that often the actual workaround code will have to be included in Bitcoin forever, since it needs to be able to validate old blocks.
Also, the quadratic problem was by far not the only showstopper for any size increase. All kinds of orphan rate reducing measures and general performance enhancements, for example.
Anyway, it's getting a bit moot talking about what-ifs-years-ago now. There's also such a thing as developer time and capacity. There's only so much a group of people can do in a given time. Complaining a few volunteer open source individuals weren't fast enough is validly countered by "what stopped you from doing the work yourself?".
It took 2 years to get here, but SegWit starts today. Time to celebrate an awesome achievement.

Why are you assuming a hard fork is necessary at all? And what time frame are you taking about? Do we need one before or instead of segwit?
And what makes you think the search is not still on? A hard fork is still on the roadmap.
3 years of searching didn't find anything. Nor did anybody put in the effort to get one fully implemented and ready to roll out. Probably for reasons: there wasn't any pressing need, Bitcoin wasn't ready for an increase, it's bloody hard and segwit is a better solution anyway.
The only efforts that went into scaling have come from Core devs. That resulted in something way better than any hard fork could have been. And now it's time for the loudmouth trolls to put up or shut up: do they really want bigger blocks or were they just trolling with hidden agendas?

Oh yeah you really got me there... you think 1 Satoshi will be $1 soon, yet with only a million LN users. That's some prediction! And oh... I lay awake at night thinking of that doom scenario I can tell you.
Anyway, you're missing the point that it only happens when one-sided closing of a channel. As long as you're staying within the LN network you could use a millionth of satoshis all day long and with cooperative closing you can transfer and round-off to another channel before closing this one.


It's provably fair and you know what you're getting into from the start.


Who says it's a complication? And it can be useful far far before 1 Satoshi == $1, as in you know... micro payments.


Pull Requests welcome, I'm sure.


It's never been a solution as there's never been a network cheap enough (not VISA/paypal or any of that sorts) with enough scale (sites like changetip) and promise to fulfill it. Whether the problem is really there, we'll see. This is a solution that can start working from the cups of coffee and scale down to micropayments while scaling up in size.


I doubt that. Straight up Bitcoin obviously wouldn't scale to those levels, but LN is in the ballpark of efficiency of a centralized solution yet still being a decentralized network. But I'm sure centralized solutions will pop up if LN proves there is a market for it, so we'll see.


Sure. We'll have to see. Maybe LN will not scale down to below cups of coffee, simply because nobody needs that. That's still cups of coffee in countries where it's $.10 or lower per cup. Doesn't make LN any less of a success.

That sentence alone has at least two errors. You're not even trying.
1. There's no such thing as "full 1MB" anywhere in SegWit. That number exists nowhere.
2. SegWit certainly uses way more than 1MB and it's all just transactions bunched together just like it's today. 


If my SegWit transaction takes up less weight then the block has more space left over giving your non SegWit tx a better chance. Boom. Debunked. You were wrong.

Lie. But utterly irrelevant anyway. Miners don't decide consensus rules.

Same story. 70% of the companies that have already shown not give a crap about Bitcoins values of trustless money by working on KYC/AML and whitelists and black lists. 


Yet did nothing. You think devs are your slaves? Pull request or GTFO.


Because of technical reasons like the laws of physics, logic and game theory. They must be your shave as well as be capable of bending the laws of physics? 
By not understanding and misrepresenting all the above facts you've displayed a huge amount of ignorance on subjects like Bitcoin but even basic open source principles.

You'd do good for yourself staying out of toxic wastefulan where you find those false arguments and lies.

@_date: 2018-10-05 00:25:33
All true. But reliance on 0-conf is still bad as it restricts the devs in the ways they can change and optimize Bitcoin.
It also totally makes no sense in the long run. Small payments (that would be low enough risk for 0-conf) use LN, larger payments (risk too high for 0-conf anyway) will pay mining fee and go on chain. There's simply not enough block space to do the coffee transactions anyway, so they will be priced out.
Merchants can do whatever they want, but 0-conf is not a selling point of Bitcoin. What happens to work acceptably well today is not guaranteed to work at all tomorrow. Don't build use case on top of it.
Believing false promises and lies (cheap/free/secure payments for everybody forever - Roger Ver) is how the bcash idiots got themselves fucked. Andreas might not be nefarious like Roger, but he also tends (used to tend) to oversell and over promise.

Of course they are. Just like in BitTorrent nodes up and downloading. They spread peak load over time and geographically, effectively load balancing. They also increase robustness against interruptions, downtime, DOS and other attacks. They grow the crowd in which you can be more anonymous. They provide services to phone wallets and other light clients. They can be archival nodes that store all chain history. All very important in any P2P network.
What they don't do is weigh in on changes in consensus rules. Because it's easy to run fake nodes. However other full nodes that are used for protecting a wallet or sending/receiving transactions do very much weigh in on consensus rule changes and are a critical part of the network: they are what the word "decentralized" entails. They're also impossible to fake, luckily.


It absolutely very much does. Nobody is paying for the P2P network or the storage of the blockchain or for the bandwidth to get transactions from you to the miners and back, or even for the development. And that's exactly one huge reasons why blocks need to stay manageable. If the required level of altruism becomes too high, nobody will do it anymore. You clearly have a level of comprehension of how Bitcoin works not befitting the tone in your absolute statements.
It looks like you were bamboozled into thinking otherwise, possibly by the complete and utter retard of an author of the blog post linked in the OP. On the other hand you seem to be deliberately confusing yourself and others by carefully choosing the wrong words to describe things.

You need to step back and open your mind a little further. You're missing the point.
"Valid" was indeed a human construct cemented into math (software code) by the human(s) calling himself/themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, that exact code decides what's valid and what's not valid. That's the set of rules we all bought into. That's the set of rules that defines what Bitcoin is and what bitcoins are. When my bakery decided to accept bitcoins and the moment I said "I accept bitcoins" I implicitly meant that entire set of rules, and none other than that set. And if you expect to buy a bread from me, you better pay me in those exact bitcoins, defined by those rules, or else you'll starve.
Miners do not play any special role in that. I did. That was my decision. There's no democracy that decides the rules. I decide what I accept and when you get a loaf of bread. There is no 51% of miners that can change those rules. I am not accepting anything other than the original rules. Period. My Full Node decides what bitcoins are valid and which are not. I care so extremely little about what miners or others with invalid blocks are trying to tell me that I fully automatically completely disconnect from them and ban them. One millisecond and poof they're gone from my universe. No bread for them.
Now, if I were alone, you could call me a senile stubborn old man. But it so happens that I'm not alone and there's a whole (tiny but growing) economy of people out there that think the same thing.
Now you may think we'll be stuck with 8 year old stone-age rules dreamed up by fallible humans for eternity. But thanks to the foresight that she/they had, some forward compatibility was built into those rules. That means the rules can be actually be updated and everybody already agreed to that beforehand because that's part of the set of rules. Introducing SegWit, a combination of much sought after solutions to elusive problems and bugs that Satoshi left us with, with a doublding of block size as sugar on top. SegWit fulle adheres to the set of rules set out by Satoshi, so it's backwards compatible. Those that don't care, don't need to look at it. Those that want to use it, are free to do so (and actually free up space for others by doing so).
Butbutbut... why the 95% then? Because the new-rule people can only use those new rules if they're sure that their coins can't be stolen under the old rules. If just the two of us would agree to use SegWit it would work perfectly fine until some spoilsport comes along and sees a anyone-can-spend[but-only-under-these-extra-rules] transaction of ours and spends it without adhering to the extra rules. That's why we ask protection from the 95% of miners to make sure such spoilsports don't make it into any block. Note how we're not taking away any freedoms, they can keep doing whatever they were doing before and they'll be just as safe if they ever accept a bitcoin from us. We just don't want them to be spoilsports.
Anyway. Miners don't decide rules. Users do. And miners are users too. Which users decide? How much power does each user have? It's not a number, but it basically comes down to how much a user stands to lose if Bitcoin were to fail. That doesn't mean just a number of lost bitcoins or their $ equivalent. But also the value of the machines that turn to garbage (ASICs) or their Bitcoin-dependant company that goes bankrupt. Or their job disappears and they have to look for something else. Or they've wasted many years of their lifes for nothing. Or their hopes of a peaceful corruptionless future for their grand children and all the rest of mankind goes all to shit.
How do they decide on the rules? 3 ways: 
1) The smoothest, safest and least controversial method is described above, using the built in forward compatibility, causing the least amount of disturbance in day to day usage or causing others to lose in any of the ways described above.
2) hard fork and 3) altcoin are basically the same: sell your bitcoins and buy AltcoinX with the rules you actually prefer over Bitcoin's rules (for whatever reason). This means you abandon Bitcoin and leave it for dead (completely ignore it, pretend it doesn't exist anymore) and you now start believing in this new coin and putting all your trust in there. Option 3 clearly causes a loss for people that stay behind: your sell causes the price to drop and the support for Bitcoin to decrease pushing everyone else a little bit closer their set of rules losing out.
A hard fork tries to limit the damage by everybody (preferably) well in advance agreeing on a rule change in Bitcoin. How and through what forum that agreement happens is left as an exercise for the reader, hint: it's impossible to do formally. But assuming somebody is able to propose a rule change that is so obviously an improvement for everybody, literally nobody loses out, then it could be pulled off. One conceivable such scenario would be the discovery of a huge bug where basically every hope is lost anyway without a bug fix. But if such a hard fork is activated, nobody needs to sell their Bitcoins or buy AltcoinX

That's what i meant by non SegWit block. One without a witness commit in the coinbase.


That should have been "non-empty blocks". I was under the impression that AB can be done on full blocks too. Jihan just being too lazy to bother implementing that and not caring about looking suspicious.


I doubt they care about looking odd. They haven't so far and it's battery obvious. But either way, that means creating as many SegWit transactions as possible, right?
Yet Luke was saying not use SegWit. I understand the past where he wants to keep the blocks small as long as possible. And it's probably not unwise. But I'm wondering if he took the above into account too.

It was discovered a month after the fact, not by themselves but by Greg Maxwell who stumbled on the problem. Clearly for at least a whole month none of them even looked at testnet.
As far I'm aware, they then came up with some lame excuse like testing somewhere else or whatever. I don't think they ever fixed it (as that would be admitting there was a problem to begin with). They did start ripping out huge portions of their shitty code, so it's possible it was fixed "accidentally".
Testnet is specifically meant for testing cooperation between different versions of bitcoin as well as wallets and other 3rd party software. Cooperation and compatibility tend to be kind of important on consensus systems.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:29:34

"lack of clear dominance" is in the eye of the beholder. It's quite clear to me, but I'm sure it's not to many newcomers. Especially those that end up brainwashed before they get a chance to learn.

You've been explained all this a thousand times, yet you keep concern trolling and FUDding.
Segwit doesn't change the MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE value or its name, but that doesn't mean it still has the same meaning as it did in old versions. You'd see that if you looked at the places where this constant is actually used.
In what way does something called "base-size" say anything about the size of whole thing?
BTW "base" points to "size" not to "block", so "base block" and "primary block" are both wrong.


Thanks for proving the point that blocks DO get larger, just old nodes don't see the entire block. (Because they only check up to the base size. Isn't it amazing?)

Yes obviously when looking at the huge centralization happening back then. Node count dropping like a brick. Orphan (stale) block rates providing a statistical clue. Now mostly, i believe, fixed thanks to compact blocks and FIBRE and libsecpk1 and others.
Also note that before 1MB there were several stages of soft limits. Clearly proving that whatever the limit was set to, it was quickly filled to the brim. Supply of low fee transaction is infinite.

Fully paid for by bitcoiners, both the hardware as well as the electricity. With the promise of a steady stream more income if they don't fuck up.


Not anymore than any other group of bitcoiners with similar bitcoin holding and turnover. Because that's the thing that matters: the stake they have in the future of Bitcoin. Nothing more, nothing less. Yes their hardware holdings do count as stake.
3. Dragging politics and dirty political games into a poorly scientific expedition directly aimed at providing non-political impartial universal money doesn't make any single sense whatsoever. It merely proves they have hidden agendas and evil intentions. That also means those dialogues are NOT going to happen. Bitcoin will not let itself be held hostage by scammy politicians. Bitcoiners have done all the work necessary to make bitcoin ready for the future including a block size increase.
The scammers who have been whining for larger blocks for 3 years and have not done a single positive thing in all that time are now stalling the roll out of the very thing they said they wanted. So i guess they didn't want a blocksize increase so badly afterall, proving it was just an excuse for a dirty old fashioned power grab. Weaseling themselves into a position of power and ready money without having to work for it. Or just trying to kill bitcoin entirely natively thinking it will raise their investments in eth and other crapcoins.
Every day they stall true scaling they undermine people will realise there getting swindled. A big flush of a large pool of scammers and toxic wasteful assholes is upon us.
Dialogue with that sort of scum would instantly kill bitcoin, as it turns into a political toy, betraying Satoshis promise.

Don't mind people being a bit pissed off. You have to understand they get idiots who pretend to not understand in order to just waste everybody's time every single day.
Learning Bitcoin takes a long time and everytime you reach a level where you understand something new and you think you now understand the whole thing: I can guarantee you that you do not. There are always more details, deeper rabbit holes to figure out.
In most fields details are just that: insignificant details. In Bitcoin one tiny easy to overlook detail can sometimes completely reverse the incentives or be a reason why some seemingly obvious solution can't possibly work at all, putting your entire understanding upside down and inside out. That makes it exciting and fun, but if you're not aware of the fact that you don't fully understand, it's easy to make a fool out of yourself. Plenty of people (probably almost everyone) have over the years and some of them kept doubling down and refusing to learn that they were wrong. Those people are what you now see supporting bcash or sw2x or any of the other failed attempts.
Keep asking questions, but be careful with making definitive statements.

Miners are hired by bitcoin to do one task. If they fuck up that task they get fired.


You use words you don't seem to understand. SegWit is online scaling, so are MAST , Schnorr, SA and the hard fork that has been on the roadmap for a year now. 2nd it's insane to demand online scaling it it's unclear whether that necessary or even physically possible. 3rd you can do the online scaling yourself and suggest it to the community, of all open source: put up or shut up.

1) Most miners run their own custom version of transaction selection anyway. If they do, one of the most obvious changes would be to always select the highest fee.
2) There's nothing they can do to make 0conf safe anyway. They by definition can't know which side of a double spend was "first".
3) There are many perfectly valid and non-evil reasons for double spending.
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:05:57


dismal -&gt; roadmap (autocorrect fuckup)


1. I don't understand why you are so keen on redefining new consensus rules and shoving them down people's throats. You have some authority issues? Power disillusions? Fascist? "I know what's good for the world" nanny feelings? Which is it?
2. SegWit does that, while skipping 1.
And the fact you are blabbering about a poll proves you really don't get it at all. You can go ask Ver for all the poll results you want, it still means nothing whatsoever.
The only "polls" that matter have been running for a year now and that's the polls in which XT / classic and BU are completely and utterly rejected and pissed on by the entire market (yes, markets decide, i.e. economic players).
But let's not get into the dishonesty by the devs of those rejected coup attempts on admitting their failure and pissing off. No instead, they regularly alter code in incompatible ways and keep partitioning and endangering the LIVE network further.


Are getting paid to run or were themselves paying for BU. Until the day that BU fucks up and loses them blocks and they will switch to consensus compatible code in a split second. Or even sooner when their orphan rates increase as they're not compatible with proper engineering solutions like FIBRE. Or when they lose fee income because BU is more than a year behind in important updates (and ripping out earlier updates, i.e. working backwards) on fee selection and block generation performance. Or when the whole network pisses down their necks demanding they stop blocking scaling.


Care for what? Scaling? You fucking kidding me?
Core took about a year to get SegWit in perfect ready condition for a safe update. In the meantime bigblockers were whining and shouting and crying about needing bigger blocks right now. They kept bikeshedding about the exact size and how to roll it out, but in reality literally ZERO proposals were finished to a state where rolling it out was even remotely possible. In other words, they achieved NOTHING in MORE time than SegWit took. And there's still NOTHING today.
So SegWit has already proven to have been the fastest possible path to block size scaling, despite all the simplistic lies spouted elsewhere. Put up or shut up. You had years to put up, you wasted them, you came up with nothing and you're now even lagging behind with nothing to show for. How much more time do you need everybody to wait?
Well, like I said, I'll wait. Because I've never said bigger blocks were a priority or essential to Bitcoin survival or higher fees would doom us all or any of that crap. Those were bigblocker claims and they've all been proven total bullshit. Every day that SegWit has to wait, adds more proof to that fact.

IOW none are. IOW every single of your claims are straight from your ass, which picked them up in rbtc.


I didn't say that at all. I said your 70% is




Strawman. Nobody wants that and nobody is aiming for that. Except Ver, he'd love to own a dev team+mining pool+bitcoin.com to decide everything and control all disinformation flows. Luckily he's failing badly on all fronts. Except apparently for you, you're eating his shit straight up.


Let me guess a simple google search will prove that too? Because that's total bullocks again. Dumbfuck parroted conspiracy bullshit from rbtc. 
And nice attempt at avoiding all my debunkings of your lies and factual corrections. Typical troll behaviour of course.

Only to the extent that the transactions fit into a block. So in practice miners simply take all the highest paying transactions until the bock is full. The rest is left in the mempool for the next block.
In Bitcoin not the entire mempool will fit into one block. Which is exactly what you'd want because it means there's enough money on the table left for the next miner to mine the next block
It also makes predicting fee levels possible: simply keep an eye on the mempool for a while and pick a fee that seems to be enough.
In fact it's the only way to have non-zero fees: of the whole mempool is emptied into each block, then there's no reason you would ever pay more than 1 satoshi for your transaction.

Oh I'm glad they split off. For myself it's perfect. Just like rbtc was a huge relief. But that doesn't mean that i agree with them confusing and brainwashing newcomers to scam them into becoming the next generation foot soldiers for the evil cause. Now not just through propaganda but through direct also financial incentive.
No confusing addresses is different from relay attacks. Although related i guess and people do lose money. Sometimes things can be recovered but not always and there are opportunities for fraud.
In the end it's the user that has to make the mistake of sending to the wrong address, but then social engineering, fishing or malware can of course fool a user on purpose. And even if not, can you really blame the user? Bitcoin is hugely complex as it is, can't expect everybody to also magically understand the extra nonsense. Residually since it would have been child play for any half decent dev (which bcash doesn't have) to change the addresses such that wallets can automatically detect and verify which are correct and which isn't.
Sounds like you grasp today attack fine. Bcash does seem to prevent those, even people I trust to know have said such. Still i always first send my bitcoins to a fresh address before sending any bcash. If not to prevent replays then a least to be sure that i don't accidentally send my bitcoins to that bcash address.
Lol. I didn't mean to give you FUD. I'm not a very good narrator so my brain dumps must be confusing, i guess. I'm fairly sure i said true things, although emotions do mix in. With the technical stuff I'm fairly sure i stay within the bounds of what's true. If I'm not sure that i know something i tend to not present it as fact, if at all.
Dumping bcash goes as follows:
1. Send your Bitcoins to a new address of your own, wait for the confirmations.
2. For the old address export the private key and import that into a bcash spring wallet (coinomi on android is one shitcoin wallet).
3. Send those bcash coins to an exchange and sell. You might want to put in some seek orders at a higher price like 0.25 of you believe Ver and Jihan will hold their promises of pumping bcash soon. Or maybe they are bluffing, they're known for that in fact.
Each of these steps contain some important details that depend on the wallet you use. For example if you use bip38 wallet you probably should create a new one (new backups etc). Then as step two you can import the seed words into coinomi (if coming from mycelium you need to enter M/44H/0H/0H in advanced settings derivation path).

Make no sense vs go right ahead, nothing is stopping you.
It's not a contradiction, but if you see that as such, at least you understand the point. I guess.
It's not that I require 100% compatibility, the universe does. The very definition of bitcoin requires that. You can't make something that's in any way better because it needs to be 100.0000% exactly the same, otherwise it's not bitcoin. And there's always a slight chance that you made a mistake or your language compiler made a mistake and then your version is dangerous rather than better. Even the slightest chance of that makes it worse already and a risk not worth taking.
Now if you have suggestions that will unambiguously make bitcoin a better bitcoin then we can certainly talk about putting that into bitcoin, changing the rules of consensus.

Anyway my example was just an example anyway: if you believe bitcoin is mostly used for drugs and you want the price of bitcoin to go up, you should be for anything that makes it hard to acquire drugs without bitcoin.
Same if you think bitcoin is used for remittance (to e.g. Mexico). Then vote for the candidate that would make sending money abroad illegal, so the only way they can do it is through bitcoin.
Strict laws drive people to bitcoin to circumvent them.
Whether that aligns with your own morals and wishes is a different discussion of course.

Correct. Nice summary of my long-winded post.


Yeah. Only for people using the new features. Conservative users need not worry. That happening though would indicate a very bad activation sequence. SegWit requires 95%. Guess depends on what kind of soft fork it is if that high is necessary.


Mytrezor users have their wallet and signing happening in the Trezor hardware wallet. But yeah they're generally not running a full node themselves (yet... I'm very much waiting for the day i can finally use my trezor on my full node). 
"Generally safe" hmyeah trusting that the site to alarm them of any evil forks going around and not censuring their transactions and some other trust issues.
It also depends on what kind of hard fork were taking about. For a pure blocksize increase maybe yes (simply because light clients tend not to check that at all). Other changes might be much more evil and might make light clients incompatible or not. Same goes for soft forks. Soft/hard does not equal good/evil or simple/complex.


Yes, this. The more a client checks, the more it can earn it's users against strange things happening. Some checks are things like checking signatures or block properties. Others may include statistical things like the time since the last block. Having week fortified clients means evil people have less wiggle room to launch their attacks, be it double spends out an evil soft or hard fork. It means a user always needs to consent to any change, even if functionally everything important remains the same (pretty much like in the segwit case) it's useful for users to have to opt in by disabling an alarm or updating to a slightly newer version that has its alarms tuned to the new situation. The more people that can't be lured into updates (good or bad) the better the rules get cemented and protected.

1) Serving (all) historic blocks is not part of being a "full node". Full only refers to "fully validating".
2) Your full node today already doesn't check signature for transactions older that X when doing an IBD. Might as well not download those signatures at all then. Tada: saving on bandwidth and storage.


Where was that advertised? Surely not in the context you are implying.
But apart from 2) above. When you're serving data to light-almost-full nodes (a new class above what currently is called SPV nodes) you do save on bandwidth, as those nodes only request signature data for blocks/transactions they're actually interested in.
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:13:42
Or a simple spike in bitcoin price that cause temporarily causes obsolete mining hardware to be profitable again. Or cause current miners to overclock their asics a bit (less efficiency but higher hash rates).
Or a concerted push by people wanting segwit to mine old hardware (or overclock current hardware) at a slight cost just to help segwit over the threshold.
Both could be done by Ver too, but he's likely already running at capacity, probably at a loss, if he's desperately trying to block segwit.
Another beautiful thing miners can do is slightly change their block selection algorithm from first-seen to first-seen-and-SW-enabled. That would shift almost all orphans to Ver, giving him a taste of his own medicine. Orphan cost would almost entirely go to Ver and whatever percentage that is will go to activating segwit.
That's without outright orphaning non-SW blocks altogether.
Anyway, i don't think any of this would be necessary in the first place. SegWit will just activate on its own fairly soon. Every day extra it takes is a day of Ver's empire crumbling down further. Forcing him into an ever more impossible position. Win-win.

So you're blaming core for banning sw8x nodes before the moment it activates by saying they will not be banned at that time because sw8x doesn't set the HF bit.
Let me down that for you: sw8x scammy and grossly incompetent, blame core.
Yeah you are dense.
And nullc explained this well there: nodes will get banned automatically when they send invalid blocks, the problem is that the shit chain will be shorter so those peers will only send headers not full blocks. And the headers look fine. So an unlucky node can be surrounded by shitnodes (which will no doubt be sybbling like crazy) for days.
So to repeat from the link that you clearly didn't understand and thought supported your case:


So again: yes, nodes already ban others that send them shit. Maybe not fast enough and only one at a time, but they do ban. Making the p2p network self healing eventually.
Oh. Who'd have thunk that to understand Bitcoin and p2p and game theory and adversarial thinking you need a brain that can go a bit more than one step deep...
But in this case smart people see shitstorm coming and figure it's better to, beforehand, morph the p2p network into a shape that results in a clean break where nobody gets stranded on a deserted island. Everything works perfectly fine until the split and once the split happens each side will be perfectly fine.


I never said anything like that. But for the record i think those reasons are nefarious topped up with gross incompetence, just like all the other failed shit forks we've seen over the years. Done by the same people, no less: XT, classic, BU, CE, bcash, sw8x.

Thanks for basing your entire argument on this premise. Luke says fact, you call that troll. Makes you clearly wrong. Which proves my point. Thanks for proving my point.


Hahaha surprisingly hahaha LOL. this is totally hilarious. You've completely misunderstood (and misquoted) luke. It's surprising to you because you misinterpreted his words. He's not contradicting other devs out himself at all. He's merely going to the logical extreme.


And you really thought that's what he was saying. I'm laughing so hard right now.
Go reread the thread above where he says those things. Just play devil's advocate and assume his statements are correct and continue with the next statement. It's all part of a perfectly logical puzzle, each step following from simple definitions and straight up logic. But make sure to read his exact words, don't rewrite his sentences in your own words.


Yeah the ease with which you dismiss pure facts proves that fact you are the troll.  Quote some indisputable facts and then call it trolling... You think you have a shred of credibility left?
You are the one trying desperately to change the definition of the word "block" to be somehow "not the whole block". If you start out with a retarded definition, of course no amount of logic is going to get you to the answer.

You can whine all you want about me not correcting you, but i have many times. But let me show you one instance where you actually picked up on my correction (or luke's) and then apply the same to an exactly analogous situation.


Right. Thanks for proving my point. Now finally you're using the correct definition for block. Yes block, whole block, is larger but not all of it is sent to old clients. No magic, no problem, makes perfect sense. No need for deceitfully misquoting the source code and all that blabla to build a house of cards with your own made up nonsensical definitions.


Nope. Exact same thing as your misunderstanding of the block thing applies to the transactions as well.


The whole *transaction* is not delivered to old nodes...
The transaction, the whole transaction, as was sent and signed by the sender, is just as big as it was before, but old nodes don't get to see the whole of that transaction. Sure to them it simply looks smaller (and a bit weird). Everything is relative and constricting yourself to one awkward close minded viewpoint may make it look like the sun revolves around the earth, but i hope you'll agree that isn't true.
Similar problem with definitions is happening here:




Misquote, indicative of you using a different definition of hard fork. Sure Luke might have been clearer by adding "successful hardfork" or something like that, but his consider clean definitions actually make a lot of sense, avoid a lot of wishy washy great area and make reasoning and communicating about the whole system much easier. And that's kind of the purpose of definitions to begin with.
So basically rules X define Bitcoin. Changing those rules incompatibly to Y is called a hard fork if everybody (100%) goes along. Or it's called the start of altcoin Y while Bitcoin keeps churning on with rules X.
Here the point of view is actually important, those definitions are from the point of view of the observer. If Luke sticks with rules X, nothing changes for him and he may not even be aware of Y even existing. If however he goes along with the hard fork and switches to rules Y then that's Bitcoin to him and he can forget about the old rules.
You may say that's cheating with definitions but it makes perfect sense here (in contrast to your sun around the earth example above). Luke is no fool(*) so he certainly won't make either choice on his lonesome and end up with a Bitcoin with nobody to transact with. So he will only switch if he knows enough of the people he cares about switch to. That may include his bakery and his church accepting bitcoin, but even people he never transacts with directly, he needs to know that almost all of them will also switch because money needs to be able to roll, otherwise it's not worth anything. So if he's confident that 99% of everybody 20 steps away from him THEN hell make the switch.
Both those numbers everybody will have to pick for himself and try to estimate himself (they're not measurable, nobody ever said hard forking was easy).
Now a few years later two Bitcoiners may have a conversation and say: "remember 2 years ago when Bitcoin hard forked?" And they'll be correct and sharing the same definition even from their own different view points.
But if those two people run into a single straggler still holding on to the X rules, the straggler would say "no hard fork ever happened". He'd be right from his perspective, but he'd be just as right as walking into a supermarket with monopoly money and insisting on paying with it.
Now that situation of course becomes chaos when it's not just one straggler but like half the population. Both claiming their own fork is Bitcoin.

Hey trolly. It's becoming more and more obvious that you're completely avoiding the point I've layed out for you multiple times now, because you don't have a response. Because i got you cornered. You're desperate. Why don't you stick to the facts for a change?
I'll repeat:
Bitcoin blockchain and blocksize and scalability have grown exponentially over its lifetime. Much faster than any Moore's law or equivalent you can think of. And it's on the virge of DOUBLING again within one year, probably the fastest growth in one year so far.
Further 10x, 100x, 1000x, 10000x is also being worked on very hard. Not by Ver or the rbtc trollies obviously, they're still stuck on 2012 ideas like xthin or whatever it's called today.

Adding to great response: Core is the only bunch of devs to have created a safe blocksize increase. In record time. No alternatives even showed up until 3 quarters of a year after Core's solution was completely finished and we will have to wait and see if that alternative turns out to be fatally flawed as it was rushed in weeks without design or or review or testing.
Then talking about pissing contexts: big blockers blocked the block size increase for almost a year.
In the meantime Core has been working on a way to roughly halve the transaction sizes. I'm sure you agree that's smarter and better than doubling the blocksize, in every possible measure, right?
They're also working on a future hard fork that includes a block size increase as well as many long standing but fixes, clean ups and efficiency improvements.
All the above they have and are doing while at the same time doing the normal boring job of maintaing, improving and fixing the other parts of bitcoin like many orders of magnitude speed improvement and memory usage reductions.  Important work without which bitcoin would have ground to a halt by now even without any block size increase.
Not a single line of useful code was produced by the fakers of XT/classic/BU/CE/bcash/b2x. Instead they just turned out to be huge wastes of time for everybody, showing down and activity shitting progress up til outright hijacking the block size increase rollout for political games.

Thanks for the honesty and not jumping to conclusions and digging in. Critical thinking and scepticism are certainly valuable trades.


Certainly agreed.


Most have indicated such. But it's not just a yes/no boolean choice. There's also a time component. Let's remember that prior to the segwit-as-softfork invention, most devs were slowly trending towards a 2MB hard fork, which would have also included basically what segwit does. Simply because segwit fixes some performance scaling problems, fixes malleability, etc. All either required for a size increase or extremely handy and why-not-if-we're-forking-anyway.
It's easy to argue that such a hard fork wolf have taken longer to develop and get consensus on and roll out safely than the current soft fork. It's basically the same plus some more work to make it safe and to plan everything.
Anyway, i feel segwit is a beautiful compromise to both sides. Necessary fixes and performance improvement and safeties with a nice smooth increase in block size. I watched the live video stream by Pieter presenting it in HK in the middle of the night and i instantly knew that was the perfect solution we'd be happyen looking for. I seriously couldn't imagine anyone not excited or disagreeing with it. (Well that last part lasted only a few days.)


Same here. i have a feeling the people currently putting in the actual work do. And the naysayers will soon be proven nothing more than a loudmouth nuisance when segwit activates.
@_date: 2016-11-09 18:03:10


Can you point to where you argue that raising the 21M is possible through a soft fork? Because as far as I know that's impossible, unless you do something convoluted nobody would ever fall for _except_ if all full nodes are not full nodes (like BU) that just blindly trust. Which was the whole point of this thread and you've just circled your own tail.
Not to mention that you're trying to call something that is clearly undeniably evil (raising the 21M) a  non-evil standard soft fork.
But I'd be glad to be proven wrong. A 21M raising non-evil soft fork.

It's not good at all. They're stealing and leaching off Bitcoin's community and name and trust, explicitly intended to confuse and scam newcomers and ignorama's into thinking they're the real deal. This reflects negatively on Bitcoin and it costs countless hours of headache to honest people having to correct all the lies and FUD as well as eventually end up being blamed once the scammers go off into the sunset (or more likely pivot to their next scam).


Nope. addresses are confusingly the indistinguishable, causing support overhead for many companies and people losing their coins by sending them into the void (or some scammer's pocket).

All clear blabbery, filled with lies and twists and misunderstanding. 
Just a random one, i already told you they went there without even the ability to speak for core as that is physically impossible in a decentralized bunch of individual open source developers. Are you a slave driver for wanting them to promise things and then work for your pleasure? So no i do not agree with you twisting my words to imply otherwise. Go do the work yourself already. 
Another lie+misunderstanding if yours: pretty much all devs were and are in favour and working towards some hard fork. Before HK and after HK and desire HK. Even funnier: it was already on the roadmap before HK and still is. That's the extend of you misunderstanding everything.


Plenty to fulfill the promise. I say on time too, but if you want to argue deadlines you can go complain to Linus Torvalds and he'll tell you to fuck off mr slave driver. Maybe if you had helped instead of bitched, it would have been done sooner.
Also fun fact: that

We'll see who prevails in blocking scaling. I'm not in a hurry though. People in doubt are allowed to take their time to think about it and rid themselves of the lies of dispicables like you. They will, as you have nothing to offer them. I'm not in a hurry, i wasn't the one screaming for "bigger blocks now" and then pivoting around when bigger blocks were delivered for free on a silver platter.
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:19:30


I know. Was being quite rhetorical.


Maybe. Or maybe we're missing some killer app where it will matter. (it's not just about the size of the payment but also about the rate). But even with your assumption, the bitcoin price merely has to go up 1000x to get there.


Did I not just link you to a reply by rusty where he said they're NOT doing the probabilistic thing (yet)? You're beating a dead horse.


Sure I could probably build a little system with some database, some PKI, a public API and roll it out over a few cloud nodes. That should scale to millions and millions of users no problem.
Except, where do the millions of users come from if they have nowhere to grow into this niche from? And then how do I actually handle the value part of it? All the regulation and bank handling shit, KYC, KNC, getting bank accounts frozen, people demanding 10 cents on the far-off-country-bank account by tomorrow or else, blahblah nightmare. And as soon as I get a tiny bit of succes a 1000 competitors will stand up and completely fragment the market to fuck so nobody can pay nobody anymore. Like instant messengers and all that crap. But maybe LN doesn't solve it either. Tough luck.


Not anything recent unfortunately. I haven't even had time to read Rusty's blog post series. You should read the one on routing.


I said ballpark near. Sure in terms of data packets it might be 100x behind, but in terms of milliseconds it can be just fine and monetary cost might actually be quite close because the total cost is spread over many users and spread over time. Just like using BitTorrent basically costs nothing for the users (otherwise unused bandwidth) while hosting popular files can be quite costly to have them served reliably and fast and DOS protected and all that. Even though technically the total cost of BitTorrent is probably higher, it can be a valid alternative.


Not really, because then you're committing X bitcoin up front and the only difference with just paying the whole X in one go is a bit less trust so you can pull out at any point. But in the meantime the whole X is locked up as it can only go one way (or the remainder back to you). Can't really think of any usecase where that's actually very useful. Maybe between exchanges sending bitcoin back and forth quickly.
Anyway, you're missing out on the huge efficiency benefits that LN provides: netting of payments back and forth (and since it's a network, payments going in circles). As well as the fact that the bitcoins aren't really locked in, since you;re free to send them anywhere (through multiple hops or even to normal bitcoin addresses)


Not sure what you're calling a "check", but only enough fee needs to be available to close the channel, not for every payment.


They start small, with small limits on money lost due bugs and user error in the first version. Sounds only smart and fair. But it's open source, so anyone could rip out those limits if they wanted to and further versions will surely have higher limits anyway. We already have a system perfectly capable of doing $20 payments, so I don't see why you think it's a problem that they keep the first version below that. Scaling in a downward value direction makes perfect sense, upward a lot less, at least initially. Scaling up in transaction rate is key here, not so much the value per transaction.
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:18:05
I haven't checked lately, but blocks weren't full by any stretch like a year ago (and even a few months ago when i last checked). And the miners that were complaining the most were exactly the ones that created the most empty blocks. The companies complaining the most were the ones wasting the most block space by sending extremely inefficient transactions (coinbase or blockchain.info whichever it was). One of the uses of RBF is to consolidate multiple transactions into one (for examples exchanges that do many transactions within seconds or minutes of each other), but bigblockers were the hypocrits trying to block it. RBF also helps in fee discovery, getting stuck transactions unstuck therefor making it safer to start with a lower fee.
But more importantly: there's an infinite demand for cheap perpetual storage. It doesn't matter how large blocks can be, there's always more demand. A decent amount of backlog (with decent fees) is required for a healthy fee market, so all's well there too.


Tried yes. Only proved that it's harder than it seems at first and therefore not a surprise that segwit took this long. It's easy to come up with simple ideas and shout promises while complaining that the core devs are stupid.


Same here. And i hope people remember the drama and hold the trolls and liars accountable for many years to come.

More devs (and growing) than miners (centralizing further). Priorities?


That's why it doesn't make any sense to have multiple implantations of the consensus code anyway. Only reduces security and increases infighting. And it certainly doesn't make sense to split available devs. Answer, already being worked on, is libconsrnsus and then people can make as many implementations of the rest as they wish.


Utter nonsense. Greg isn't limiting anything even if he wanted to. We're limited by the nature of bitcoin, B which is consensus on a single specific set of rules or bust. That's bitcoin bust, end of story.

One big omission in your analogy: that free speech is not forbidden at all, they can simply go elsewhere and speech all they like there. It's just not on topic here.

There's no threat of punishment like a government wild do. They're simply not welcome at this party. Boohoo.
And I'm glad theymos saved this party as i clearly remember getting extremely close to quitting reddit entirely as rbitcoin was being overrun by trolls, around 2 years ago now. I haven't seen a single example of inappropriate bans or other advise if power by theymos but if it did happen is with that little collateral damage.

I'm afraid you're not doing a very good job at it. Most of your posts are debunked parroted points, lacking facts or logic completely. Often an old school stance on computer scientific topics like security, p2p, consensus and adversarial thinking shine through. Bitcoin significantly changed those fields of research to new levels where old "good enough" thinking doesn't suffice anymore.
Anyway the point in my previous post was that you're not getting the maximum effect out of your criticism efforts by posting in a dead forum or by saying false things. If you're uncertain about something you can ask, but posting nonsense and expecting a correction that you can then just ignore is troll tactics. 
As an academic I'm sure you know how science works. People saying the earth is flat are just ignored. People saying something's wrong with quantum mechanics are allowed if they show an effort to honest discussion, or bring better alternatives to the table. Lacking those, quantum mechanics will simply steam on. Just complaining wave particle duality makes no sense is worthless criticism that won't influence anything.

Fact is segwit allows for all 3 method of efficiency increase:
1. Increase clown car size. Yes it does.
2. Decrease clown size (through SA, MAST, Schnorr, etc.)
3. Reduce the demand to put clowns in the car: people (for example exchanges) can optimise their processes in order to reduce the number of clowns.
@_date: 2016-11-01 08:44:07
I don't intend to talk for him, but SegWit pretty much replaced any 2MB hard fork plans in whatever stage they were when SW was discovered to be possible through a soft fork (nov 2015 i think). As it's pretty much equal in size increase but comes with so many other improvements (most of which would have had to been done before a hard fork too) that offset the danger from that size increase and opens a whole swath of further future improvements.
The Cornell study was shown to have missed a few considerations and therefore to be a bit optimistic. Also, wouldn't you agree a bit of safety margin is wise?

You have your argument upside down.
3 easy steps, try to follow:
1. Current full node operators have implicitly agreed to incur some cost for the benefit of the system (and themselves).
2. If that cost increases for no extra benefit, some operators will say "too much" and stop. The young point is different for all operators, but in the extreme every single one is guaranteed to stop.
3. One sure way to increase that cost is to allow spam and not fight it. Spam by definition has zero benefit for anyone (otherwise it wouldn't be spam) let alone to a node operator. Bringing him closer to that toning point.
Now how do we distinguish spam from non-spam? Look at the blue eyes of the sender?
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:23:01
Bitcoin wasn't ready for 2MB back then. A shitload of security and performance improvement still had to be done first. SegWit itself includes more of those and other countermeasures to negative effects of larger blocks. Also a hard fork would have taken at least as long to develop and would take longer to roll out and activate. 
Compromises are bull shit, this is fucking science not a tea party.

Hashing is not even a race (let alone lives depending on it) : if you have 10%, you'll get 10%. If the bitcoin price is such that you're not making much of a profit then you downclock your ASICs to make them more efficient (i.e. do 90% of the speed for 80% of the electricity).

Definitely ahead of block size. That's the whole problem with the debate. There are people that either want to attack the fungibility or dismiss out of ignorance the importance of fungibility, for them raising the block size seems like a no brainer and they're even willing to handwave away practical things like hard disk and bandwidth and CPU requirements.

Which is. So we're full circle. 


No i wasn't. I was just leading you around the bush, as you were taking nonsense. 
Payment channels with multisig lockin and one-sided close have existed for ages now. Whether that's how satoshi envisioned and implemented them (his sequence number didn't initially work at all) is irrelevant, it got foxed and improved upon late. But it was possible before LN was invented. Without segwit and without Malleability fix.
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:18:04


In reality there isn't anymore. It was basically over when Pieter announced SegWit as soft fork at the HK Scaling conference.
And by that I mean the debate regarding the first step. Future steps are debated on an ongoing basis while new data is being gathered, experimental software is being written and tested, ideas are refined, etc. There are many different options for further steps, some complementary, some competing, some high priority, some lower. Some simple, some more complex. All of them not in a huge hurry (compared to that first step) and most of them depend on SegWit (or make much more sense after SegWit).
Now as for the debate you think there is. Two points.
Ignorance. There are people who still think the earth is flat, surely, you're not calling that a debate anymore? Moon hoaxers. UFO's, climate change... endless list.
Ulterior motives. Money, power, fame. This often drives from the ignorance above, and profits from it at the same time.
How do you see which side of a "debate" falls into the above 2 categories and which doesn't? Science.
You see if you can verify as much of the claims made by the parties as you possibly can. While keeping an open mind on the ones you can't verify (because of your vantage point or knowledge). That can be hard, but in a lot of cases you can quickly catch one side sinking into blatant lies, outright denials of obvious facts and convoluted unnecessary conspiracy theories. That side can then quickly be discarded completely. Nothing is lost from completely ignoring them. Life's too short to waste more time on them. There are too many other people to listen to, they deserve a chance first.
The only danger in the above strategy is that you need know your own boundaries and limitations regarding your knowledge and keeping and open mind. If the subject is not your area of expertise you have to be more careful and take more time.
Remember the liars are trying their best to call the other side liars. Those who misquote the most are the loudest at claiming the other side is misquoting. Those who fabricate/misread statistics are the loudest at claiming the other side is doctoring statistics. They know what they're doing. Their goal is (at best) to strengthen their cemented ignorance or (more likely) confuse the hell out of you (eventually for profit). They're trying to get you to think they caught the other side in a lie and therefore you should discard them (as per the rules above).
If you hear someone say: "we had 2 feet of snow fall yesterday therefore global warming is debunked." you know he doesn't understand simple things like averages up to whole complex (possibly outside your area of expertise) things like climate models. And you can also see that he's making that claim in a dishonest tone, he could have said "at least in my area, this year, we had a lot of snow, I don't have data on the rest of the planet and don't know how all the models work, but if global warming is a thing, I have at least one data point that's an outlier."
Same with block size. "My home internet connection can easily download 1GB in 10 minutes and I have a 2 TB hard disk, so raise the block size already."

Because if people don't, then that's direct proof that the extra blockspace wasn't so hardly needed in the first place!
Also, your estimates are ridiculously unfounded, especially the word "certainly". But even if you were right, it would still be faster than preparing a non-contentious blocksize increase hard fork would take.
So take your pick: SegWit's gradual doubling or nothing at all. Whatever you want. I'm not in a hurry.
@_date: 2016-12-04 10:44:27
( : was incorporating coin age into the segwit weight function ever considered? Would you have some pointers? Good idea/bad idea? Thank you.)


Interesting variation i hadn't heard of before. One problem i guess is the reward going to 0 eventually thus creating another (disappearing) variant into the already complex system of incentives. If satoshi thought of using coin age like that i wouldn't be surprised if he chose against it because it made everything more complex to predict and tune.
However there's also talk of having part of the fees be paid forward to future miners. Coin age could be mixed in there. E.g. miner receives (50% + up 25% extra if lots of high coin age), rest goes to whoever mines the Nth block in the future (or smeared out or whatever).
Or maybe simpler: just incorporate coin age into the weight formula that segwit introduces. Giving a higher discount on the witness data weight depending on coin age?

Yes SegWit does double. Latest estimates have put it over the 2MB mark. I'm sorry actual facts don't reach you as well as the deceiving lies from trolls 
It does very much address further improvement like Schnorr and MAST and Signature Aggregation. And it makes future hard forks easier if necessary.
On the other hand XT/classic/unlimited promise unicorns but deliver 0. Absolutely 0. No proper design. No specs. No finished product. No peer review. Riddled with bugs and security problems. No testing. No compatibility.
and do not address the issue of needing even more capacity when the time comes

Core didn't. And Pieter certainly didn't. They couldn't if they wanted to. So thanks for lying in your opening sentence. Makes it easy to see the troll you are.
Oh but the people that did go to HK and signed that document, did keep their word and did what they promised to do (except for that one mining pool). So yet again, your point falls apart completely.


Everyone except liars and quacks matters. rbtc, BU. XT and whatever that other one is called fall squarely in those categories. Plus they're literally working on and achieving absolutely nothing, so they're completely irrelevant. Whether you then conclude that core is the only remaining voice or not, I couldn't care less.


They do very much. Economic users for short. And that means not the loudmouth fakers and shitcoin pumpers, but people with a true economic stakes. Some are getting confused by rbtc and other loudmouth liars, but they'll soon do what's in their own interest.


Then they don't understand Bitcoin and will be on the losing end. Bitcoin is not a political game where you get some if I get some. Bitcoin prefers the scientific highway where facts and logic matter, not FUD and quackery.

Ver and his amateur dev-team-du-jour are so grossly incompetent that it's simply a matter of time before coin-stealing-malware infected version of BU/XT/Classic/whatever gets distributed. Maybe it's already out there waiting to strike.
It takes a lot of effort and skill and dedication to have a secure development and distributed build environment where build are properly signed and committed to the correct source code.
Not to mention that those clients are not in consensus, proven bug ridden, not peer reviewed, horribly designed and extremely outdated lacking security updates. Huge risks to users there too.

Sounds to me you're interpreting his question as a multi-party payment channel, but as far as I know, nobody is seriously working on that. And it doesn't sound to me that he meant that. For 1-to-1 payment channels, the answer to his question is "no, the coins are sent to one address".
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:29:01


That's totally incorrect and not even close (which is ok, just informing you and other readers). There are great resources that explain SegWit very well. 
The tl;dr (in context of block size, other contexts are actually way more interesting and important) is blocks can become bigger, roughly 2MB.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:13:57
That's protection. If difficulty would decrease miners can easily come back to do a 51% attack. Sitting it out (miners will lose a of money) or PoW change only answers i think.

@_date: 2016-12-01 09:26:10
Correct. "new" would like to know it has a large backing by miners for their thing to work safely and keep working. If miners would fake support and then back out later, that would be tricky. The recommendation is to not immediately after activation start using it for large transactions. But after a while when it's clear miners are really spring it and there are plenty of full nodes keeping those miners from backing out then "new" wild be cemented and pretty much as safe as "old".
@_date: 2016-12-10 23:48:04
Yeah really... and saying that stupid shit a ten year old could come up with makes you think you actually understand anything? The fact that people with obviously a ton more knowledge have a tiny few objections against that does not make you think maybe you're missing something, instead it makes you double down and drivel even more kindergarten logic?
It's all open source, go do it yourself.

@_date: 2016-12-05 13:49:13


No, I didn't say collude. Just help. Any miner NOT mining on the latest valid block is "helping" the attacker by making the attack easier. If the attacker can burn down the warehouse of one of his competitors, then he's helped by the reduction of hashing power. If the attacker can feed blocks that are hard for some miners to process then them not mining (or mining on the wrong block) is helping the attacker.


Difficulty is a delayed and smoothed representation of network security. If today I blackmail the Chinese president into shutting down all Chinese mines (say 50% of the world hashing power). Some attacks now become immediately easier, simply because the non-evil miners takes longer to build their honest chain, giving me more time to build my evil chain or to pull off double-spends or Sybil attacks.


Correct, but it's hard to know a split is ongoing. There's a lot of variance in block times, are we just unlucky with a few 11 minute blocks or is there a split going on? Or did a few big miners have some problem? You probably need to look at averages on the order of the difficulty adjustment period (2016 blocks).
Especially in a BU situation where some miners may have been trying to mine larger blocks for a long time: that hashing power is completely hidden and not even part of the difficulty, so there's no statistical indication either.


No no... 30% guarantee, the remaining 70% is 50/50 chance of winning the race (another miner building on top of your block). So that's 30% + (70% / 2) = 65% winning the race, 35% lost.
The 1% miner on the other hand will win 1% + (99% / 2) = 50.5% and loose 49.5%.
This is already the case today, it has nothing to do with BU. That's why a lot of work was done to lower the orphan rate. I have no idea what it is today, I believe less than 1% even, but it used to be a lot higher.
But that calculation does show that orphan rate is punishing the wrong person, so building anything that depends on the orphan rate to punish the evil person makes no sense. And even if it were, the bigger goal must be to reduce orphan rate to as close to 0 as possible, so if that succeeds the whole punishment and everything depending on it disappears entirely.
Note that the above story only applies to situations where there is an orphan race to begin with. 99+% of all blocks never even start an orphan race as there is no competing contender.
And that's all average case! Large miners tend to have fast connections to other large miners, so if the 30% miner knows his blocks will be accepted by another 50% of other miners really quickly he'll basically have an 80% guaranteed win in an orphan race. Fill that into the above formula.


I wasn't talking specifically about BU there, just mining in general.


So kicking off 5% of the network is perfectly fine, because you're creating a block that 95% of the network can handle? And tomorrow? The next 5% ?
Also if you could have a signaling system where you can reliably know what the rest of the network thinks, we wouldn't need Bitcoin at all.
No matter from what angle you look at BU, it just doesn't make sense.

It's not about opinions. You're making it a political game again. Democracy and politics are bs nothing to do with Bitcoin.

Could he start lying at some point and everyone will believe him (see Ver)? Could he be threatened by some mafia to do evil things? Or what if he simply doesn't understand something and explains it wrong? Who is going to correct him? Will someone party him for his work? Does that hurt his credibility and impartiality?
So many questions. Even before you start looking for someone qualified and willing to do the job. Is looking even the right method? Shouldn't just wait for such a person to naturally arise, like all other "jobs" in open source?
Andreas is often seen as a spokesperson of sorts. But as much as i appreciate his efforts and knowledge, he definitely makes a lot of mistakes too. Wrong predictions. Misunderstandings of details. Outright mistakes. He'll admit to most of those afterwards when he realises them, but that may be years later.
Improvement is always welcome. It's just not a simple as appointing someone and expecting to be fixed. If that doesn't work in government or big business, it certainly doesn't work in semi anarchistic open source.

Nonsense. With segwit an old nodes can still trace all coins all the way back to their coinbase origins. And old nodes can receive any of those coins perfectly safely just as before.
With your 21+M fork you can never send a new coin to an old node.


False. 95% is just a setting. But SegWit will by definition have 100% consensus once it activates because like i said: satoshi already arranged that.
Only a reliable &gt; 50% miners is required for security of the new rules anything on to of that is the devs being good guys and letting users decide for themselves and giving them enough time to do what they need to do.
Funny how XT and Classic are trying to activate with a measly 70%, which is not even reliably larger than 50% and certainly no extra safety or good guys margin. Nor do they give nobody any time to upgrade once it advocates. While they're freaking hard forks! Thanks fucking Gavin for that low life move.
And BU is even worse by activating after 6 blocks. Complete and utter retardation.


WTF are you on?
Miners are very limited in power. Users with full nodes have the power. Miners can only follow. If miners activate an evil soft/hard fork then full nodes will tell them to fuck off and take their blocks and shove them up their asses. (And not get the rewards.)
Good thing that SegWit has great and growing support among full nodes already. Miners will get to do the honours of cutting the activation ribbon, but that's all.


Your trolling has clearly taught you to always say the opposite of the truth. Funny how it now made you produce a statement that's only applicable to XT/classic/BU like plans where miners get more power and get control over the blocksize limit (which they don't today).
SegWit: full nodes and economic users stay in power through full consensus.
BigBlockers: more power to miners, fuck full nodes, democracy, tyranny minority or majority.
I don't give a fuck about miners mining empty blocks. It's a nice statistic to an indication of validationless mining and such. And it's a hilarious indicator of the hypocrisy of bigblockers as they never complain to the miner for wasting precious block space. They're even coming up with excuses for the miner. 
Immutable refers to data (transactions) entered into the blockchain according to rules say out by satoshi. It doesn't refer to the software and it doesn't even refer to the rules either. As explained before: Satoshi approved of backwards compatible changes.

Yes it's one of those oft repeated lies from rbtc. They're so desperate that even lying about obvious facts isn't beneath them anymore.
Blocks get bigger, more transactions go in. Simple as that. It's in the source code, it's in the design document. It's visible on the testnet. It's the only way it makes sense anyway.
Yet some people feel the need to lie about it, just to confuse/brainwash newcomers.

@_date: 2016-11-18 17:29:46


You're right, that's true. I screwed up my example.
Different example: if high-resource miners know that 40MB is supported by 90% of all hashing power, then they have a mechanism and incentive to make 40MB blocks as that would push out the already struggling 10%.
That means a majority of hashing power needs to actively block blocks they deem too large, choosing a limit that is generous and safe to their small competitors (no incentive to do that). It also requires collusion (bad) to agree on a number (if they don't ask use the same limit, they're easy pickings for an evil miner pushing them out one by one) and it's still dangerous because you never know if one of the other miners will break the agreement to screw you over.


Miners can be (and must be able to) be anonymous. I have no idea why they're mostly not right now. At least that's what it looks like, for all we know there already is a 50% miner pretending to be 3 miners.


Not all fishy things are easily detectable (and provable). Censorship for example. And "fix it" means nuclear option. Yes, it's an option and a threat that miners better remember, but it's not an easy weapon. It will create a lot of damage and fall out.
Well another thing users can (and will) do to punish miners is to sell their coins, dumping the bitcoin price. An inefficient worse version of Paypal simply isn't worth that much. But that too gives a lot of collateral damage.

Pathetic gullible liar. Why are you even taking about code if you clearly have zero understanding of what code even does?
@_date: 2016-11-10 10:03:06


FALSE. The whole sentence doesn't make sense, but to counter what you deceitfully parrot: We won't get 4MB anytime soon, but it doesn't take "everyone needs to run" to get size increase, the more people need that size the more they'll use segwit and get that size. If they don't need it, then who cares how long it takes? So which is it, is the world ending because block limit or is it going to take 3 years because people dont need it? Make up your lying mind already.


FALSE: Not a single viable proposal exists today. Let alone anything that could dream of getting consensus. Any possible proposal would have to include pretty much all of segwit, otherwise there no chance in hell anyway.


FALSE. Dumbest conspiracy bullshit in the book. LN wasn't even invented by BlockStream.


Bullshit. 1. You're quoting him out of context, as per usual troll practice. 2. SEGWIT IS A BLOCK SIZE INCREASE, so apparently he kept his out-of-context word anyway. Which means you're just a whining bitch.
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:10:27
Bullshit. They forked themselves off the testnet. Proof that they're not in consensus (not even classic with BU let alone with Bitcoin) as well as proof that their shit is completely untested and bug ridden.
Yet that exact code had been promoted and sold to sheeple idiots as release quality solving all scaling problems for many months before.
@_date: 2016-12-04 11:17:02


That's a good comparison as both with BU and validationless mining, the attacker is helped by the part of the hashing power that accepts and not rejects his blocks. Which is not what Satoshi described in the white paper.


But not the blocks. Both sides of a double spend are valid transactions, validating individual transactions isn't the whole story.


A shit ton of work has been poured into Bitcoin over the years to reduce the orphan rate. Orphans are always bad for the network security a whole. X% orphans means X% of the total hashing power was wasted. And worse: during such a fork, the hashing power is partitioned, 50/50 worst case. Which is the ideal opportunity for an attacker to make his move.
So orphan rate must go down for many reasons, including thinking about increasing the block size. And exactly then do the BU morons come up with the brilliant plan of using the orphan rate to penalise... wait for it... the **small** miners that can't handle bigger blocks very well and are already suffering the brunt of whatever orphan rate was already there. 


Your description doesn't make sense, local settings don't define what gets orphaned. But that's ok, BU doesn't make sense anyway and i don't think anyone can actually explain how it really works anyway (implementation changes every month and has no spec and is deliberately convoluted).
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:59:06
Want actually put in the table yet, but yes for a while that seemed to be the direction that had consensus. Until something better was discovered. Very telling that those people working on it shifted towards segwit. Also very telling that the bigblock fakers have produced nothing over a year, not even a copy paste of Pieter's last version packaged into a hard fork. Even that was too difficult to pull off apparently.

Is that the code that Matt found 3 glaring amateur grade security holes in within 5 minutes of looking at the code? Or was that the one that set testnet on fire and burned down both BU and XT, without anyone even noticing for more than a month?
Oh i see, it's just a fire side chat with grampa Zander. Not a single line of code. Full of "should be easy to code" with nothing to back it up other than the misinformed imagination of the reader.

What i also don't stand for is not calling out scammers for what they are. Hard working honest people's careers can be bombarded with lies but when the scammer gets told to put up or shut up and then still produces literally nothing while continuing the barrage of lies, then suddenly were not supposed to step on poor little scammers toes? Fuck that.
May i remind you that 3 separate dangerous unfinished hard forks, still being hacked on regularly (while already live!) have been trying to achieve coup levels of support for over a year now? No end date? No "i see there's no consensus let me try something else". No proper honest super majority activation level.
I agree it's good news that they've all failed miserably and didn't get any support whatsoever. But let's not forget it's the exact same people that we're talking about here. Proven deceitful ongoing lying scumbags don't get my benefit of the doubt. They can go stand at the back of the line and after i listen to the millions of others that would like to have a chance to have their idea heard, maybe then they can get a second chance.

Holy crap NO!
Wow, that explains why you people say such incredibly stupid things! You don't know what decentralized means! Wow!
You're talking about "distributed". "No single point of failure" has been pretty much a solved problem for decades, it may just get very expensive depending on what degree you need.
Also you need to learn what relative means, at some scale there's always some single point of failure. The whole earth is still a single point of failure: if it suddenly falls into the sun you're fucked anyway.
Decentralised means no central point of CONTROL. In a lot of ways that's a much harder requirement than no SOF. Although we don't need to worry about the whole planet blowing up anymore either.
Single point of failure... Single point of control... Let it sink in for a while.
Yes on practical points there's a shitload of overlap. Mostly because Bitcoin is ALSO distributed. Being distributed is probably even a requirement of being decentralized (except planet size problems, for now). But it's definitely not the same.
Decentralized is what makes bitcoin special, not just distributed.


So fucking what? It's not the stone age anymore either. Nor are we living in Star Trek land with subspace communication. So?
Everything is fucking relative and we know the level of decentralization is fairly bad today and we know which direction makes it worse. That's all that matters right now.
If you want to talk absolute numbers you need an anchor point. You can't say "it's been 1MB for eight years now, thus Moore's law..." because block size hasn't been 1MB for that long (nor block limit, although it didn't use to be a very hard limit, it was hard enough that block size jumped up in lockstep with each raise of the soft limit). So block size increase has already been faster than Moore's law anyway.
Also is not just about bandwidth.

OP proved that already which means the status quo is also not safe as it can suddenly degrade into big block mode.

Bitcoin keeps undo buffers if I'm not mistaken, so it can roll back a few blocks if necessary. But even keeping a few block headers or blocks (if I'm not mistaken it will keep at least 500 MB of those around regardless) doesn't change the fact that they're not necessary in normal operation. They're merely kept to be able to feed them to other nodes. Pruning is pretty neat actually.

No. The point is: the full nodes represent what real users want the rules to be. If miners pick different rules, then the miners are in trouble because nobody will accept their newly mined money and it's worthless.
Problem is the numbers of full nodes is impossible to measure and is easy to fake either way, but that doesn't change the above fact. That's why miners should be careful to try to estimate support among users carefully before changing any rules.
That's also why it's important that real users (people holding or even just accepting bitcoins) protect their own holdings and money flows by running a full nodes themselves. Protect it against evil miners (and other dangers).

So much tyranny that nobody is forced to pick either the old or new version. Not even miners.

Science already constrains politics in a lot of ways. Bitcoin is a very specific small area of science that is in the end even less susceptible to politics, i think.
Yes Bitcoin depends a lot on what people want thus if you are able to fool people into thinking they want something other than they really want (i.e. politics) then you can influence things.
The thing is, to achieve that you have to continually lie and keep adjusting your lies. Over enough time even the dumbest followers will start to smell something fishy is going on.
Examples: "fee event will be catastrophic.",  "bigger blocks now", "changing one constant, so easy" (yet nothing after years of saying that), "segwit's bigger block is... not bigger".
The liars are continually proven wrong and are achieving nothing positive for their followers. They can't deliver on the hollow promises.

Thanx. I had read a few posts by nullc (~year ago) to that extent and looked into that research a little myself. But I was too short on time (and lazy) to look up any references for the reply above.
Other points that speak towards Satoshi's "honesty": (maybe interesting to )
1) He made it impossible for himself to pre-mine blocks by including a news paper headline in the genesis block. (Would have been a very valid criticism had he not done that of course, so would have undermined Bitcoin proposition entirely.)
2) There were often many hours between blocks in the early days, indicating there weren't many people using using the system at all. He could have kept his own machine churning and pick up a block every 10 minutes, but apparently he didn't.
Both don't prove that he didn't mine a million Bitcoins anyway. But it makes it at least plausible that he did NOT mine the first block at all (and thus that whole Lerner set of blocks), leaving that up to a random lucky person.
Let's just all hope it wasn't Ver...

All nonsense. Simply proven by the fact that not a single working alternative exists.
Fixing malleability is impossible without splitting off the witnesses.
Increasing the block size is neither simple (no viable proposal even exists) and it requires a fix for the quadratic hashing bottleneck as well as many of the other safety precautions segwit provides.
Both paths lead to almost exactly segwit. Both paths would require at least another year of development and a year of rolling out. SegWit is here today.
@_date: 2016-11-28 07:36:37
Not luke, but let me give a shot at some of the many reasons.
The easiest one is the exact reason you are thinking of yourself: how do you prevent people from donating to your address after you've spent from it? You're bound to end up with multiple spends.
Also 1 address doesn't mean all the coins are now "one thing". They're still distinct coins, which just happen to be controlled by the same private key.
Another reason is privacy: everybody who pays to this address has their privacy reduced, even if you don't spend from it at all.

Very much agree that bitcoin should be non-political. I guess a bit of consensus seeking will probably always mean discussions and inevitably some politics, but hopefully only between technically similar solutions that don't have a clear technical/logical winner. 
But what we're seeing now and what i think you're referring to is outsiders trying to push their politics in. I don't see Core being involved in much politics and they seem to be pretty much ignoring or fighting against those pressures.
Am i missing something?

That doesn't make sense. If the crypto can't be done safely in a virtual machine / emulated environment it also can't be done safely on hardware. Simply because a hardware hacker can get in there and do the things he'd do that make it impossible to do in software (breakpoints, alter registers, read/write keys, whatever).

Thanks for agreeing on amazing past performance in scaling. That's a good first step.


Well, aside from there being damn good reasons that you have decided to put your fingers in your ears and go lah lah lah for, SegWit is actually another doubling, which is equivalent to about 8 years of your 10% per year growth. So you don't have to worry about this for another 8 years.
Way before that time we'll have Schnorr and SA and MAST which will add another couple dozen percentage. So we're good for at least 10 years by your own demands. And Bitcoin will far surpass your trivial demands, I'm sure.
You're way too fixated on block size, blinding you to all problems associated with increasing it as well as blocking you to all superior alternatives.
How do you think hard disks themselves have scaled? Not by blindly increasing the sector sizes i can assure you. Not by blindly increasing the number of sectors.
How did CPUs scale? Not by blindly increasing MHz, that's for sure. Nor by blindly increasing the number of transistors, if that were true your cell phone error be the size of a football field requiring a coal plant to power it.

Bitcoin would have been dead at 1MB without libsecp256k1 and FIBRE network and a ton of other performance improvements. Nooo question. And if let to the wims of the xt/classic/BU bozos, it would have exploded even more spectacularly.
Todd, btcdrak, nicolas, timon, luke, wumpus. Have a look at some changelogs. (And don't come dismissing this whole list by simply pointing out one that does work for BlockStream or luke did a job for them once.)


Weird question since a lot of them were already around before labels were handed out. What they did: see above.


Life isn't free. Wow, isn't that amazing? Let's turn that statement around: they've improved the signal to noise ratio in all the GB's that my full node needs to download and store and upload. And prevented it from sky rocketing.


It was always unpredictable. Up until recently it was common for many blocks to be completely empty, how about that for unpredictable? The gaussian distribution of mining is unpredictable in the short term. WTF are you on about? Once we're in the realm of statistical chances: it's decently predictable and they've also provided us with improvement like RBF and CPFP that can help get stuck transactions unstuck. 


All false. They're more expensive. Low paying fees transactions get knocked out first, but those are low priority transactions that can wait until the spammer is drained. Normal fee paying transactions don't even notice the spamming at all.


There no way to measure that, but all indicators point to that being untrue. The price being the biggest indicator.

Because it's literally exactly the same except with the added downsides and dangers of a hard fork over a soft fork.
The two lines of code devs would have done differently in a clean design would make it look a tiny bit better as a design but would actually come at the cost of making block headers larger (around 30 bytes i think) for no reason whatsoever. Adding to the eternal overhead light clients and spv clients need to download.
The whole segwit hf crap is a transparent lie to try to give technobabble weight to a completely hollow argument made for entirely different, hidden agenda, reasons 
The proof is that literally nobody has put a segwit HF proposal on the table. It's super easy to develop and if you truly believed it, you can do it yourself and easily get consensus around that.

Not saying I'm against something like this, but:
People buying now are assuming X coins lost and a certain loss rate. Resulting in for example 20M coins eventually. Your proposal reduces that to 0% loss. Effectively an inflation.
To avoid bikeshedding over details there, it might be better to just make the coins invalid altogether so that information is clearly known for everybody.
Avoids unexpected coin dumps messing with the price (stolen through cryptographic breaks or found on a garbage dump/attic) as well as allowing for the pruning of the UTXO set.
Then again, I'm not sure the whole thing is desirable anyway. Plenty of time left to discuss though.

Assuming this is the number from the original LN announcement (too lazy to look it up) : a lot has changed since then (LN is more efficient already under the same assumptions, thanks in great part to SegWit) and "the whole world solely using Bitcoin" is still a while off, so we have plenty of time to come up with ways to reduce that number (like Schnorr / MAST / SA and other Bitcoin and LN efficiency improvements) as well as plenty of time to increase the block size.

Same story. 70% of the companies that have already shown not give a crap about Bitcoins values of trustless money by working on KYC/AML and whitelists and black lists. 


Yet did nothing. You think devs are your slaves? Pull request or GTFO.


Because of technical reasons like the laws of physics, logic and game theory. They must be your shave as well as be capable of bending the laws of physics? 
By not understanding and misrepresenting all the above facts you've displayed a huge amount of ignorance on subjects like Bitcoin but even basic open source principles.

Nothing to do with pretending. Just a factual observation that there currently are no alternatives. Simply don't exist.
So currently there is no choice between alternatives. It's either Core or block segwit or sell my coins.

Anticipating that question I've already explained that in that exact post. Did your knee jerk knock off your reading glasses?


That's by definition not viable. Even Gavin admitted as much finally after years of denial. Hint: quadratic hashing problem. And no, they don't have a fix for it, even their workaround is not safe.


Wow a new name. But still nonsense. SW splits data along natural logical boundaries, as is exactly what good software ought to do. It magically solves long standing problems and roadblocks to scaling and it makes lots of shit more performant and opens up further optimisation impossible before. That's what good software engineering is about. It's a shame satoshi didn't do it from the start as it would have saved a lot of delay and issues. Well can't blame him for not being perfect, that's how good engineering works.


Again: they are riddled with bugs and are untested: proven by the fact that they've forked themselves off of testnet and they didn't even notice it for a whole month! No peer review, no design. No testing. No specs. Incapable dev "teams" (mostly one person). Incompatible. No consensus. Unnecessary and dangerous hard fork (with zero preparations). No support.

Correct. 2.1MB i believe the latest is.
But that can still go up as more people start using multisig. Which LN does by its very nature. So expect the final number to go up in time.
That is until Schnorr and MAST and SA are going to make transactions smaller.
@_date: 2016-11-20 21:37:14


It's absolutely not Blockstream, not even Core making such promises. Bitcoin history is full of people going overboard with expectations. That's why we;re in this mess in the first place: people expecting Bitcoin can scale to inifinity by simply changing a number.
XT / Classic / BU directly promise endless no-worries scaling by simply changing a number, just trust us, we tested it, we know what we're doing.
That is literally their sales pitch.
That is outright scam! There's no other word for it. Bitcoin fundamentally can't scale like that, it will die a centralized death in no time. Promising people that it can is outright irresponsible and thus scammy.  Not to mention that they don't deserve trust, didn't test anything and clearly don't know what they're doing. So not a word of that sales pitch is anything near truth. That's called a scam.
Scams hurt the real article. Scams leech of the hard work done by others, while causing endless support headaches from people falling for those scams. Literally as we're seeing now. Scams are a waste of time for decent folks and pure theft of money to anyone dumb enough to fall for them. That's why they're called scams. That's why we piss on them and kick them out.


That was Satoshis plan, that's why fees and halvenings exist in the first place. If you have problems with that, take it up with him.


They're outright lies and untrue, only confirming the fact that we're talking about scams. So thanks for enforcing my position.


Well, I guess Bitcoin lost to the Greg-attack then. At least he saved Bitcoin from certain death by keeping it actually working at 1MB. And he has dozens of experts around him that are of the same opinion, so it's not even Greg-attack or Gregcoin in the first place.
In the meantime, XT / Classic / BU have accomplished absolutely nothing but adding crashes, bugs and security and DOS vulnerabilities. I'm sure this conspiracy includes some Greg induced elves that secretly mess with their codebase at night to inject these problems, because no way certainly it's not possible these bozos are simply to stupid to be writing security related software to begin with? And while they were at it, those elves also planted outright criminal scammers at the heads and amongst those all those dev teams as well? And they flew Craig from down under to London to meet Gavin, whom they drugged to mess with his scam-detection radar? Yeah thought so. Cookoo.

@_date: 2018-06-24 19:17:30


True. Missed that. But the fact that you complain about slow transactions and high fees actually means that you misunderstood an important part of Bitcoin (not an insult, very common and understandable; nobody really fully understands Bitcoin anyway). "Fast and cheap (onchain) transactions" was never a selling point for Bitcoin (except by scammers like Ver luring in gullible fools to fleece). Fees are a necessary requirement for Bitcoin to even work and capacity is obviously and necessarily limited. It's impossible to expect "fast and cheap" (onchain) out of that equation.
And yes, fees were much higher than made sense back in December, but attacks on Bitcoin are to be expected and many good defensive steps that everybody had been lazily postponing for years were finally and pretty quickly taken as a result of it. For example, capacity has increased a lot now (SegWit usage), but more importantly the fee estimation algorithms of wallets have been improved from braindead to okayish (lots more work to be done there). Also usage patterns have improved a lot where large users like exchanges now batch transactions and are much less wasteful with blockspace. Further: dumb use cases like small payments for cups of coffee were finally shown to be nonsensical in practice after having been warned as such for 6+ years.
Instead we now have a system where you can pay 1 satoshi (cheap) with instant confirmation (fast) for a pixel on a shared drawing board: satoshis.place (NSFW at the moment I just noticed, but it's about the idea, not the actual pixels).


I feel that's actually one of the goals of the drama in the first place: spreading FUD to (1) fool ignorant fools into a position where they can be fleeced to the bone and (2) make the space as confusing and opaque as possible for any non-idiot to get the full picture in order to damage Bitcoin improvement as much as possible and extend the time window for fleecing ever more fools as long as possible. It's understandable (and healthy) if you don't want to have anything to do with that, just understand who to blame.

Segwit IS a blocksize increase.

Link to one? You can't because you are misquoting them. Contentious hard forks are catastrophic. Uncontentious is fine, when bitcoin is ready for such an increase.


The fact that you're implying that segwit is not an actual blocksize increase is telling. Telling us that you're a troll.


I'm glad it didn't go down the political route like that, but guess what: segwit is exactly what you describe there. Conservative increase with many security and performance fixes that wolf have been required for any increase (sift or hard) anyway.


The deceitful, the ignorant and the liars have been flushed. Good riddance. Just a few trolls remaining in their wake, but they'll lose out too soon.

Pointing to theymos sounds pretty lame to me, I've never seen anyone banned for normal on-topic decent posts. On-topic means no altcoin shit, which makes perfect sense. And that includes no contentious incompatible alt-clients which is also perfectly normal in any open source project. In the context of money they're direct hostile attacks by definition, so doubly so.
You getting downvoted... You've probably got a reputation by now. I try not to downvoted on reputation alone, but it's only natural that people do.
Anyway you're wasting your time on rbtc. Everything you say is abused and misquoted by the dummies and political scammers that can't possibly understand what you're saying anyway. The sub is literally dying, the number of troll-reincarnates is going down, even the downvote bots are giving up and reason-posts by rbitcoiners often stay in the positive points. Despite mods including Ver pushing for more lies and trolls on his own forum.
It was always irrelevant for people in the know but i predict it's going into obscelence as SegWit gets activated. 


I accept you as a smart guy befitting your credentials and you may be somewhere between 10% and 99% bitcoin expert (whatever that means). But reality is that you're the ONLY such person around with this opinion. All experts have their opinions and differences, but you are really far out of the mean. I literally cannot think of anyone else saying similar things.
So either you're really really special and the only beacon of hope for this entire world (that's what Ver thinks he is BTW, literally calling himself Jesus) or you're just human and wrong from time to time on highly complex details.
If you are a lonely one of 100+ experts it would be wise to tone your arguments in such a way that (and in a forum where) others are able to have a true discussion and everybody learns.

He's trying to appeal to the simpleton mind and insinuate the "other side" wants higher fees for the sake of higher fees.
The choice is not high fees or low fees. The choice is decentralized bitcoin or centralized bitcoin.
One is a product people would pay high fees for to use. The other is worthless and even low fees wouldn't lure enough people in because VISA and paypal will have even lower fees. (Centralized coin will have to oblige by ask the same laws and more.)

Those alternatives better hurry then. All those same people have tried to pull off so far (3 times) is introduce untested proven dangerous hard forks aiming for not 95% but a mere 75%. 75% which wild thanks to variance be guaranteed to trigger at 70% or less (the 95% truely is 95%).
So they're so convinced of their own failure they refuse to even run the same race but cheat it from the start as well as betting on three horses at once, altering the code while the house is already running so nobody really knows what they're voting for anyway. With the intention of screwing over a whopping 30% of the community. Some consensus.
That's the sort of low life's we're talking about here. 
Good thing bitcoin people in general (proven vast majority, as all three hard fork coups combined in a year didn't reach the level of support that segwit got in 2 days) are not stupid and don't fall for that transparent shit.

Meaning old nodes reject all new blocks and thus end up on a fork of the chain. Presumably without much hashing power and therefore no security.
@_date: 2016-12-24 18:41:18
Ah you think LN will be less private. Well i know the devs are writing really hard to get the incentives and ease of use pointing in the direction of automatic effortless privacy. Even lazy people must be private by default. I think that's doable and there are quite a few factors that naturally already point in that direction anyway. One is that large hubs will need to lock up a lot of money.
Another is the example that bittorrent provides, that is pretty damn private except in areas that do not apply to LN. BitTorrent oftentimes has centralized search sites/trackers which don't apply to LN at all. BitTorrent can be joined by spy nodes that will gather IPs of who's downloading what files. Also not applicable to LN. and BitTorrent traffic can be sniffed by ISP and NSA like parties. Which is also not applicable to LN.
At the same time LN already starts out much much more private than Bitcoin as Bitcoin broadcasts your transactio all around the world to everyone and even keeps a history forever. In a lot of ways (not all) even large hubs wild be more private than Bitcoin itself is today (if you hide your IP through Tor and there are at least a few dozen large hubs to choose from). While LN only keeps transactions between 2 peers for a short amount of time. That's a huge head start even if devs or users screw up the rest of the privacy features.


I don't, but indeed we'll see.
But don't forget that SegWit open up a lot of near future privacy (and efficiency: lowering transaction fees) improvements in bitcoin itself: Schnorr, signature Aggregation and MAST and more.

Raging comprehension problems? I said:

Zero contradiction there. Especially for you as clearly not making sense didn't so you.
Make your own implementation. Wtf do i care? I'll make it easier for you: bitcoin is fully open source, you can just copy paste it, change one line and call it your own implantation. NOTHING is stopping you (well, lack of skills probably, but whatever).


Oh so they're not working on different implementations then?


None of which exist at this current time. Not in the open anyway. Because to be called abitcoin dev you'd have to be not a blithering idiot. A non-scam background helps as well.
But literally nobody would be against an outsider bitcoin dev standing up and doing dev work. Very much welcomed. In fact that has happened numerous times already. Plenty of new devs habe stiff up over the years. But of course they have a brain and see what's wrong with bitcoin, what needs to be improved and fixed before increasing the blocksize even comes into consideration. And then they see segwit and they think: shit, wow, definitely the best mix of scaling and security and performance improvements. Let's do that. And that's how they end up at consensus because they understand (because they have a brain) that consensus is required.
And then come the dishonest conspiracy nutjobs and start dismissing all those devs as Core. 


Nothing is stopping them. Open source free software.


Again you're completely not reading what i said.
1st of all this has nothing to do with the "one shouldn't write their own crypto" meme.


Didn't say "can't", in fact i said nothing stopping you. And also didn't say "shouldn't", i said makes no sense.  Until there's libconsensus, then it makes sense to have a 1000 implantations (of nodes, not of libconsensus).
Also i was specifically talking about "consensus on a single specific set of rules". That's what defines bitcoin: those exact rules. Change any of the rules and it's not bitcoin anymore. By definition.
That's why it doesn't make sense to have multiple implantations: either they're 100.0000% exactly the same and then there's no point in using that implementation because it's the same anyway. Or they're not and then as long as there's no fork, the network is less secure because there's a risk of forking. And then the network forks and one side is no longer bitcoin at all, making things even less secure because of the partitioning and general social chaos and political fighting and miners switching back and forth between chains.


That's actually harder to get right than the "simple" crypto stuff. But please do try, nothing is stopping you.
Just make sure you actually completely finish it and have it fully tested and per reviewed before you start promising golden rainbows to potential users. Because that's where all altcoins and XT/classic/unlimited turn into the outright scams that they are.

Half the equipment wild be powered off, so not twice the power or cooling capacity. That's the point.

There is not one vision or path. They are 100 independent individuals with their own opinions and drama and ideas. They're working on ideas that have never been tried before in the history of humanity. Most are unfinished ideas that still miss parts before they're even viable to try. 
The one thing they seem to agree on (or at least my interpretation of it) is that bitcoin is only special because it's decentralised. If that property is lost, the whole bitcoin experiment is over.
Paypal 2.0 is not interesting.
So they work hard on improving decentralization where it's lacking or endangered. Mining centralisation is one aspect. Fungibility is another very important one.
Of secondary importance is scaling (in the broad sense, not just block size).  Partly that overlaps with the main goals (improve performance and efficiency, fix malleability) but in other respects it counters the main goals: in general bigger blocks lead to centralisation of mining. So a careful balance is struck there.


That's how they try to educate or persuade eachother on their ideas. That's how open source works: the inner workings including dirty laundry is visible for all to see. There are no closed door boardrooms and secret meetings like in companies and government.
I'm glad they're an organic bunch working simultaneously on different parts of the system, developing different competing and compounding ideas without predetermined centralized planning. I'm glad they're not bureaucratically wasting their time in meetings to first come to agreement on a detailed roadmap before doing the work.

It's called SegWit.

It's not. It's a totally incompatible altcoin that happened to have been airdropped into btc holders by forking the chain. It has as little to do with bitcoin as Litecoin and the thousands of other scamcoins have.
"To fork" can have three different meanings in the context of bitcoin. Software fork (git fork). Chain fork; i.e. chain split (something bitcoin was designed to never ever do, it would be a very serious bug). And then there's hard/soft fork which are upgrade mechanisms for changing the direction the protocol is allowed to grow the bitcoin blockchain (while still being bitcoin). Soft: rules get more strict (backwards compatible, opt in). Hard: rules get less strict (not backwards compatible, everybody must upgrade).
@_date: 2016-12-01 02:54:47


Thanks. Same here. 


Sure. A bigger block size limit allows more data (spam or not) to be pushed into those blocks. But it's also the point of raising the limit in the first place. And it's why we need to be careful with raising that limit. The same statement is also true for "straight forward" limit increases.


Well the fee is not set by the software, but it's true that increasing block size may lower the fee because there's more space for cheaper transactions. Again the same wild be true for straight forward increases. But one advantage of segwit is that it's much more of a gradual increase instead of a straight up doubling. Fees have time to gradually adjust to a new equilibrium.
That said, yes segwit is a bit of a weird mix between 2MB and 4MB. Not really the same as a straight forward limit increase of either of those sizes. But the sort of data that allows it to be 4MB is the kind that's the least damaging to the network: not UTXO, not  "bible verses" spam data, easily prunable. Also is not unreasonable to expect miners to block transactions that try to cause 4MB blocks. It's not in the miners interest unless there's a lot of fee on it. And if in practice it does turn out to be a problem afterall, then it's a simple soft fork to reduce the 4MB to 3MB and be done with it.


Well yeah, that's exactly what they're supposed to do for sure. They already do that today and they should do that after segwit. Bitcoind will do that for them if that's what they use. If they have custom software for this, they need to adjust that.
SegWit makes that pretty simple though: it avoids all kinds of complex multi dimensional rucksack problems that stifled earlier proposals for improving the fee calculation (the idea of having different fee incentives for different kinds of transaction data, depending on how "damaging" it is to the network, is a lot older than SegWit).
SegWit makes it one limit: 4M weight. By applying the correct weight factor to each byte of the transaction, is a simple matter of making sure the sum stays below 4M. One dimensional problem.

Or you can run a pruning full node which limits the required disk space to whatever you specify by throwing away old blocks. Either way, running it at your own home/office is more useful to you and the network (less trust, more decentralization).

It very much is. Quadratic hashing can already cause significant block verification times. On the order of minutes. That's way too large percentage of the 10 minutes block time. That will cause huge orphan rates, which is highly centralizing (towards the evil attacker no less).

I never said the whole network wild help the attacker, just a non trivial part is already enough, while attacker+ helpers &gt; 50% is ideal.


Ok, so during the period of several blocks where one partition is trying to create larger blocks there's a fork. Which means half of the network is completely wasting its time since it's guaranteed to get orphaned soon (effective halving of the total hashing power i.e. security of the network as well as doubled block times). In the mean time double spenders will fill those forks with double spends giving them many confirmations and a guaranteed win one either side of the fork settled.
Freaking insane.


And there's the misunderstanding of the whole principle. Orphaning is not a problem for the miner creating the big blocks.
It's really simple: a miner never orphanes himself. So a 30% miner will guaranteed NOT lose an orphan race 30% of the time. A 1% miner only has a 1% guarantee. The remaining percentage is basically a split 50/50 chance for either side to win the race. Maaybe slightly lower for the bigger block, but since today's orphan rate is already very low, there not much difference. 
And that difference is easily offset by other effects in favour of the larger miner.
So using orphan blocks as a punishment is insane as it doesn't punish the right person, while it can be triggered by the evil person.


Yes he does have to fear even more than explained above. Even if there is not an orphan race (no 2 blocks around the same time, so guaranteed no O'Ryan for the big miner) :. if it takes 10 seconds longer to reach and validate on the small miners systems then that means those miners are wasting 10 seconds. Handing over 10s/10min (1/60th, almost 2%) of their income over to the rest of the network, which include the big block miner. And through trial and error the big miner can play this game and reach a point where maybe 30% of the network is in such a delayed situation. Again pulling more profits towards himself as well as reducing overall network security directly.
Any solution where miners have control over block size these problems pop up.
Yeah still reading :)

A meagre 12.8? I thought he was on camera offering 25? /s
Ok, so that's $600k. I doubt he ever spent that much on anything in the bitcoin space (actual spending, not investing).
But he needs not just 5% for the whole year, he needs 5% every 2 weeks. He better have a safety margin for bad luck and for changes in hashrate. 7% at the very least.
If other miners decide to simply prefer segwit blocks instead of first-seen in cases where two blocks are found simultaneously. That will shift almost all orphans blocks to Ver. He'll be eating a few blocks per month, 12.5 each in wasted electricity as well as reduction in percentage, eating into his safety margin. 
But most importantly: Every day he's proving himself to be a hypocritical liar. Blocker of bigger blocks. Blocker of lightning network. Blocker of further progress like Schnorr and MAST. Blocker of actual scaling. Enemy of bitcoin. I'd love to see him do this for a few months. I can wait a bit longer. The pressure is going to be enormous and he'll be digging in deeper and deeper.
On the other side I'm sure he will find people willing to pay for his expenses. There are plenty of nutcases in the world invested in eth or other shitcoins. R3 and others interested in obstructing bitcoin. All the more he'll prove himself the scammer he is.

Another one of those rbtc troll sound bites. One nicely on topic reason why that is bullshit: SPV wallets don't check the 21M limit and we've just established old nodes do.
Another thing: why would your old full node particularly care about other people's money (as long as 21M is not violated)? Remember as soon as a coin is sent to you, is guaranteed yours and NOT an anyone can spend.


Nonsense. Utter nonsense. Economic full nodes reject invalid blocks making them non-existent. It would be an altcoin that is totally ignored.
Quit thinking miners have any power at all! Thinking that makes you more vulnerable than necessary. If you don't know the power you have you'll not realise it when you lose it. Like classic and BU do: they take away power from you and give it to the miners (those 3 people you're so hung up on).


No 51% is not reliable &gt; 50%. Because of variance that's guaranteed to do below 50% for extended periods of time. And with a tiny bit of malicious power it can be forced that way. Plus the problem of miners signaling they support but then not really support it in practice we had a year ago with a few multiple block invalid chains. 
New rules users want themselves protected by as much of the heading power as possible. In fact any remaining old hash power can be leveraged by an attacker. The attacker can craft a block that's valid under old rules but invalid under new rules. Then all old hashing power will blindly follow (i.e. help) the attacker.
So any remaining old hashing power is a danger to the new rules. It's be irresponsible to go with anything lower than 95%.
SegWit allows old hashing power to continue, even after activation (although the expectation and incentives (more fees) are such that it will quickly go to 100% anyway). I don't think all soft forks allow technically that in the first place.


Cutting a fucking ceremonial ribbon. Like a fucking Hollywood celebrity throwing a bottle of champagne against a ship. What better way to describe zero power?


You think nodes don't see those anyone-can-spend transactions? They ignore them on purpose, but they can see them. And in fact they warn their operator about it in due time.




False. Users can't start using soft fork features without overwhelming miner support (anyone-can-spend without miners enforcing it, is a nice way to lose your money) and i explained overwhelming above. But miners doing anything that economical full nodes don't support puts them in danger as explained before.


With the requirement that everybody makes the same decision and updates strictly coordinated. Any stragglers or disagreeers will cause chaos and lost money and cause double spend and replay opportunities like the ETC shitshow nicely showed, with a nice plummet in bitcoin price for sure. It will interrupt normal bitcoin usage because it will be dangerous to transact for days or weeks or months. That's why you need 100% consensus for a hard fork and a shitload of leadtime and preparation. And sure, then economic full nodes have power too. Not more than in a soft fork though.




Staying away from brain-dead stupid things is not a display of power, it's something they are required to do as part of their security job or else they get fired. Doesn't sound like much power to me.
They are required to wait for economic users to signal consensus on a change. Until then miners better sit still on the status quo or they get fired.


The power to choose what rules are followed.


That's only the promise and sales pitch for gullible idiots. Just like ALL altcoins promise unicorns and golden rainbows. Secured by handwavery. The DAO hacker and many more like him are ready for the day amateur code like that is responsible for node or chain security.


How would I enforce that you run a certain exact version of software on your pc? Hope do i know you didn't alter it in any way? So software can't be immutable then.


Don't be daft. If he didn't specifically allow for those anyone-can-spend constructions he would have made whole swaths of updates impossible to do in a backwards compatible manner. A consensus system is much harder to design in such a way that updates are possible, it takes even more foresight than most other systems.

Don't be daft. SegWit is a block size increase. Blocks get bigger, more transactions go in.
It's literally like that in the source code, there's no discussion possible about it.
Source code says:  (block minus witness data) &lt;= 1MB
Thus "block" includes witness data, and that can be larger than 1 MB.

It's true that Core was already working towards a hard fork, and most devs were getting ready to are with one up until the soft fork version was invented in Nov 2015 (by luke). That actually sped things up a lot as things became much safer and more flexible. The hard fork would have likely had to have included the exact same features plus likely many more more safety features to persuade everyone to join in consensus. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 21:07:32
I never argued a specific block size. I said full blocks.
\&gt; users can still VOLUNTARILY all pay very high fees,
So changing things from a robustly balanced system of incentives where selfish rational agents doing things in their own economic interest leads to a healthy equilibrium, into a system held together by the charity and handwaving unicorns? Yeah... no, I don't think so.
Seriously... your whole (1).... you must be fucking joking. And bringing up already failed and dead shitcoins is not helping your case. They already proved you wrong. Why is it that Roger Ver is not adding a 100Bcash fee to every block to keep his scam going?
\&gt; (2) Similarly, you can have full blocks all you want, but if every txn  in the mempool is only offering 1 sat/byte, miners still don't need to  keep mining full blocks if all of those 1 sat/byte don't add up to  enough reward to pay their electricity. 
So now you're coming up with a situation where the block size is already too big and nobody is incentivized to pay a fee above absolute minimum to argue that blocks should be even bigger and not full? Like wtf?
\&gt; If you have 1mil txn backlog,  sure blocks will be "full", but if all of those 1mil txns are only  offering 1 sat/byte, miners would still not mine, then hashrate drops,  etc.
NO! What happens then is that someone who doesn't want to wait, will start using SegWit/Taproot/Schnorr/whatever to make their tx smaller (and thus higher fee per byte) OR they will simply raise their fee by 1 satoshi and miners will pick that tx over the others. And then others will start to do the same or go even 1 satoshi higher and then you start to have a healthy pressure to push people to be more efficient with limited available space as well as a fee market. And the response to that is NOT to raise the blocksize willy nilly.
\&gt; But I haven't seen a "good" solution yet to the miner reward problem once the inflation subsidy stops.
Well, huge or infinite block space is NOT the one for sure. Blocks must be full, and in fact they WILL be full no matter high large you make them (barring actually infinite): there's always demand for more free perpetual distributed worldwide storage. So full blocks is not the only requirement, it's FULL and NOT too big.
\&gt; Do we just have to decide what fee we are shooting for for an on-chain txn and then design the network that way?
Fee level is not a design goal. It falls out of an emergent equilibrium with so many parameters you can't possibly calculate them beforehand. There are many ways that will tend to lower the fee equilibrium level, like incentivizing people to be more efficient with block space (SegWit, Schnorr, Taproot, batching, LN) and possibly raising the block size. Scammers like Roger Ver have been promising free and limitless transactions for everybody. You can complain to them, or yourself for believing the bullshit, if you feel Bitcoin is not delivering.
\&gt; Full blocks means we need a TRANSACTION backlog.
That's the point yes. That's what I mean when I say blocks must be full. That's also true in any healthy market: there's a backlog of bids and asks for the good or service in question. That IS a market. Without it, it's not a market.
\&gt; We need a FEE backlog.
Not sure what that means, but a huge amount of minimum fee transactions, many more than can ever fit in many days of blocks, does not help anything. It's a healthy backlog of many differently priced transactions that is required.  The backlog needs to be big enough to bridge across natural ups and downs in supply and demand without having the price drop to 0. Any more than that would simply mean the lowest fee level transactions will start getting dropped and ignored by the network as there's no point in keeping them around.

And the header covers all transactions and one of the transactions (the first) covers all witnesses.


That's dumb.


Blocks are the collection of transaction data (all bytes of each transaction). And all bytes inside a block are immutably covered by the PoW hash. Change one bit in any of the transactions (including the signatures) and the block is invalid.
That's 2 different definitions of what a block is and both are perfectly fine and consistent. And true.


Who gives a fuck what ignorant noobs (like yourself) ask for? If your horse isn't fast enough and you ask for a faster horse, yet instead you get a car, are you going to whine too?
Besides, it is a literal block size increase. The blocks get bigger. Look at testnet for 3+MB blocks. Look at mainnet for larger than 1MB blocks, and growing. Pretending certain bytes aren't part of the block just so you can maintain your brainwashed warped image of the world is like insisting on epicycles and flat earths.


Oh yeah.. throw in some braindead retard conspiracy theory too... like you hadn't sunk low enough yet.


Nobody claimed that (well rbtc dumbfucks when it suits their narrative).


Except for the extreme towards ~4MB size transaction counts are actually pretty equivalent.


If you'd spend half as much time as you keep wasting on searching for weasel words and interpretations, on actually learning how this stuff works, maybe you'd get somewhere. You're like a 3 year old kid whining that you got the wrong flavor of candy even though it's exactly the same flavor but you're mistaken by a different color, and on top of that what you got is better in every possible way and the best that was possible anyway.


I'm not and nobody is. Maybe you should also work on your reading skills. Context and details matter. I know they're always left out on rbtc, so you may not be used to them...


Duh there are. One would have destroyed Bitcoin and cause a hard fork. The other is actually active today, growing the average blocksize steadily and in a fully backwards compatible manner, without having caused a chain split. One would grind Bitcoin to a hold, fully centralizing it around Jihan, not fix a deadly vulnerability, and immediately start the next block size war for the next increase. The other allows for smooth near-future updates that will almost double the capacity again, while at the same time reducing block sizes drastically and giving huge boosts to privacy and usability. Opening up new, safer more efficient and faster use cases.
Yeah for the non brainwashed, it's a no brainer which one was the better - actually ONLY possible - solution at this time.


You'll have to deserve that. You're actively spreading lies told to you in an effort to undermine Bitcoin and the people who have kept Bitcoin alive and grown it. You're a willful shill for scammers and power hungry lunatics.
Glad to have debunked some of the bullshit you were spouting. It wiped away the whole foundation underneath your utterly mistaken untrue beliefs. Unfortunately that did not lead you to conclude that the house of cards you built on top of that foundation was also completely flawed. Which it clearly is. You'll find that out one day. Maybe through someone else explaining the next part. Maybe through waking up one day and actually researching some stuff, like you seem to have done on the header thing. Or maybe you'll find out when you've sold all your BTC and then bcash hits 0. (oh wait.. you're too pussy to have sold any BTC because you don't actually really believe what you're saying... just like daddy Ver doesn't. All you're going for is sabotaging BTC and luring unsuspecting newbies into buying bcash so you can profit.) Adios.
@_date: 2019-08-25 18:10:29
\&gt; We're talking in the case when in block reward ends and there is no more inflation subsidy to reward miners.
Obviously. I'm talking about no subsidy and long term, many decades long steady state. Anything that "works" for only a year or a decade, by my definition does "NOT work" at all. Most shitcoins clearly don't work. Aiming for any horizon below a hundred years is just a scam in my book. Bitcoin might work, or may not. But at least it's an honest attempt and looks like a good attempt (and the only thusfar) to my limited brain. Depending on charity is not going to last.
\&gt; I'm saying that those bcash idiots will have to voluntarily raise their fees just as you describe below
Which obviously will never happen and it won't in Bitcoin either. So it's can't be part of the foundation we build this system on. Luckily in the case of Bitcoin it isn't.
\&gt; then the chain stops because miners don't mine.
You keep missing the dynamics of the difficulty adjustment: chains don't just stop. All miners don't just stop. Instead: some miners stop, difficulty drops and remaining miners get a larger share of the same reward. That's not to say that it's not bad when difficulty drops further and further. Especially while it's dropping.
\&gt; So here's a case where blocks could easily be filled with a huge 1m txn  backlog, but they won't because fees aren't sufficient, and therefore  your dropping hashrate problem with arise.
Look up "marginal cost" and think what it costs a miner to fill a block completely compared to only 10% while refusing to include the 1m txn. Why would a miner not do something that will earn him a little bit extra, for zero cost? Again: economically rational actors. And yet again: blocks WILL be full.
\&gt; people will THINK they have no pressure and only offer low fees. But soon they might see that their blocks aren't being mined,
That's probably the cause of your confusion. As explained above with marginal cost: There will always be a (full) block roughly every 10 minutes (make it 12 or 15 if difficulty is dropping really hard). Miners turning off their machines does NOT equate to fewer blocks (only temporarily until the next difficulty adjustment and ignoring the extreme of all miners shutting down simultaneously).
Sounds like we mean the same thing with "tx backlog" and "fee backlog". Miners take the top most highest fee per byte txn from the backlog to fill (i.e. full) each block. Having no backlog is bad, because then miners earn zero for the unused block spare. But no backlog is extremely unlikely (basically impossible) because demand for cheap perpetual storage is infinite. It's also unlikely that the whole backlog is only paying the minimum fee, because there will always be people to whom that perpetual storage is worth slightly more than to others. So then we get multiple levels of backlog. And a healthy market will have many such layers all the way up to a fee level that makes it worthwhile for miners to keep the difficulty at a level that is required for a secure Bitcoin to exist.
Now that last sentence had a lot of variables that are vague or unknown. We don't know what that desired fee level is (and it's probably not constant). We don't know what the desired difficulty level/security is that Bitcoin needs (also not constant).

Not reacting.




Which is by definiton completely 100% centralized making Bitcoin not Bitcoin anymore. So in short all your arguments (which were already flawed) come down to you forcefully shoving down block size increases down everybody's throats (i.e. centralized hard fork against concensus), which has already failed many times in shitforks and shitcoins, including bcash. But secretly what you really want is something that is even more impossible. And after 4 years of that nonsense, you still don't understand why people tell you to just fuck off already?


"Need" is NOT a reason to ignore "impossible".


Super simple. There are simple python examples that do it, with pretty high success probability.


Nothing like that is needed at all. Just smartly creating multiple transactions and smartly broadcasting them.


ALL 0-conf transactions can be replaced. That's what Bitcoin was invented for. That's the only reason why Bitcoin didn't exist 60 years ago. Do you even listen to yourself?

Ok. Yeah i saw nullc posting about his success of testing this with an extremely early version, a few months ago. He mentioned the database and some p2p messages that needed to be patched or bridged, other than that he went all the way if I'm not mistaken. Far into satoshi era for sure.


That on itself is not a hardfork yet, is it? Rules were tightened?


Ok, that would be a hardfork yeah. So that would mean rules weren't just tightened but (accidentally) also loosened in another area.
If that widening were to be undone (soft fork) before any such conflicting block were created, then the hard fork would be undone, correct? Would it still be a hard fork then?
(You'd first have to definitively identify the exact extent of the widening of course.)
Just curiously playing hypothetical games. No particular reason. Nor very relevant i guess.
As far as i know nullc and most others don't think it was a hard fork, right? So bitcoin either did 1 or 0 hard fork during its lifetime. 
I find it very cool that from a relatively simple system, so much complexity in unexpected details can emerge, such that two top experts can disagree on these details.

Another common meme is the whole on-chain / off-chain crap implying that segwit is somehow not onchain (and therefore not a block size increase) and that things like LN are inherently bad because they're not onchain

Blocks _must_ be full to have a working system and a healthy fee market. But full doesn't mean you can't get in anymore, all you need to do is outbid others.  And looking at it from the opposite side: there is infinite demand for cheap storage space, so non-full doesn't even exist unless you have unlimited block size.
So in short "full" isn't even a word that really applies to blocks in a blockchain, unless you change its definition to be more useful and then blocks are either always full or never full.
Stop obsessing over block size, you're looking at it all wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:53:11
Some (most/all) shitcoins are capped though by their technical flaws and ineptitude of their devs that limit their growth no matter how much inertia they seem to have. Bcash today for example is almost exactly the same code base as Bitcoin, so it seems technically ok. But even now they've already managed to screw up the codebase to insert bugs and make everyone's life difficult simply by renamen variables and moving things around and blunty ripping out good features. The tell tale sign of idiots that have not a single clue about what they're doing. They're already 1 release behind now and are completely incapable of even merging those changes into their code base, let alone come up with new features or improvements themselves. It's going to bleed to death on that front, but of course they'll put up a lot of smoke and mirrors to hide that for as long as possible just to gain inertia in another front.
So the trick is to combine the visible inertia and the hidden inertia and subtract the fake inertia for all these coins, to get to what you descrive as inertia. There's no way to do that precisely, but with rough estimates the current picture becomes much much clearer very quickly.
And then yes.. I generally agree with what you said: the rest will dwindle.


Yes, that's a very real threat. That boat will eventually sink (which is ok and I won't be on it). But the problem of that is that it may outcompete or smother the real thing for as long as it can stay afloat. It's actually quite easy to be more efficient if you have a centralized system vs decentralized, decentralization brings extra overhead and cost. That could ruin the whole scene for possibly decades and it will take another huge financial crisis or world war to give Bitcoin or an actual successor trigger again. At least by then it will hopefully have developed quite a bit further.

Using and understanding are quite different things. Pretty much unrelated other than that at least some use is advisable for understanding and vice versa.
Focusing on the usage only leads you to whining about fees being high. "Usage" doesn't mean you're actually running a full node and in many ways without a full node you're not even using Bitcoin at all and certainly not understanding it.

Bitcoin is much more than just the code, they can only copy the code. Clear and present scam.


As opposed to the premined part? Yes it was premined and the early ASICs owned by insiders (as they were supposedly impossible) mined most of the rest. Which the chief scammer has since 100% sold to suckers, at the all time high.
Every single point, even in isolation, mentioned in my previous post (which you completely ignored) and this post make it a scam. And I could name dozens more. Just like every single line of a Nigerian scam mail screams "scam!". Stop giving benefit of the doubt to scammers.
And shitcoins are off topic here, so whatever.

Ok. Interesting. Thanks.
TBH i don't see a hard fork happening any time soon anyway and i don't really care much for one in the short term or possibly ever, so that's ok.
I will definitely not be for anything lower than 95% adoption rate. (And i mean with proper 95%, not the crap Gavin and all other hostile hard forks, proposed where by mere variance even 70% is guaranteed to hit a 75% threshold eventually.)
So regarding any chance for a hostile hard fork, it's good to know this group is on our side against BU and friends. As for obstructing soft forks, that's not so good.

You've got that upside down. They limit themselves to not doing that because of malleability.. that's a wasteful arbitrary limitation that they now have to work around by e.g. pre-splitting coins (extra cost, extra risk). After SW they simply can start chaining unconfirmed transactions. Even merge multiple transactions into one, saving on block space and fees. Waiting for confirmations is a waste of time at the very least in such cases.


Nobody said there won't be fees involved.

Only in defense of BU. When used to point out that it causes centralisation then suddenly it's not true anymore because validations mining and other handwaving blabla.


What makes you think an attacker would throw the frog into already boiling water? He'd be much smarter to raise the temperature gradually, slowly pushing small miners off the network and thus centralizing his own power.  Your 1GB and 1TB extremes are nonsense that don't say anything about what happens with more more likely values.

They're also volunteers. You are not paying them. How dare you demand anything at all?
If you want something, do it yourself. If you're not happy and don't want to do it yourself. Leave. It's that simple.
Well i guess a third option is to ask politely and hope for (but not demand) an answer.
And that's true for all open source (or actually anything that you don't pay for) and even more so for a decentralised system.
And despite that, and i already told you, they do make a shitload of effort to make their long term plans, vision etc. accessible. Even though it takes their time away from actual work.

Where did I say increasing blocksize was impossible?


Exactly. Everybody agrees on that. Even all core devs and even luke. (My words, not theirs, I could be wrong.)


Excellent. See SegWit.


You're misinterpreting that statement. When scaling you jump from bottleneck to bottleneck. When you clear one, another one takes over. If you do it in the wrong order, your system grinds to a halt (or worse in case of decentralized worldwide money) 
Larger blocks is certainly part of scaling, but it can only be safely done if all other bottlenecks before it are cleared. The most important one of which is keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Which requires performance, bandwidth, storage improvements. SegWit and many other updates done during the last years, deliver a lot of that (and SW opens up avenues for further improvements). The launch of SW means that it's now deemed relatively safe to start increasing the block size. Although some devs (luke) call upon miners to not actually raise the size to the max immediately.
@_date: 2016-11-13 17:56:38
Youre missing the point. Electricity is the most important cost in a mining operation. It's limited by what the power station can deliver or the money a miner is willing to spend on it. When there are multiple algorithms a miner with alternative hardware on stand by can immediately switch algorithms to the one with the lowest relative difficulty.

Technical debt of segwit is an offer twisted and as it debunked lie.
Whether it gets activated it not we'll see, but there is currently no alternative and probably won't be ready for another year. Especially since such an alternative probably needs to come from the proven inadequate amateurs (insist not outright scammers) that have been eating everybody's time for more than a year with 3rd bug ridden unfinished software that tries to solve issues already signed in better ways by Core solutions.
Anyone truly opposing segwit, unless they bring true arguments which hasn't happened yet, is simply proving that the blocksize was never the issue but just a excuse for an ordinary power grab.
SegWit gives more block space than XT ever promised in a safe backwards compatible manner, as a mere side effect of many hugely important fundamental fixes to long-standing problems. Like malleability, like the quadratic hashing bottleneck, like the imbalance in UTXO creation/destruction incentives.
Any kind of hard fork affirmative to segwit is outright nuts and is not going to happen.


SegWit took a year to finish up into a product ready to activate. Such a hard fork would easily take two years, maybe a little less since it could take code from SegWit without having to start from scratch. So then you have segwit as a hard fork. There's not a single benefit to that other than having wasted another 1.5 years.

Probably talking about the same thing, I guess. Garzik and co withdrew the whole thing pretty last minute, but then some people of course kept running the software and then it turned out to get stuck on 1 block before the split was scheduled and then people noticed the glaring error in the clearly untested and dangerous code (as everybody had already said for months).

My post may have been a bit confusing, but i agreed with you, just added some info and constraints to the pumping. One more point to add to your post is that pumping is only possible if the upper reservoir isn't already full. I guess they would offline the next door coal plant in that case.
I do wonder whether putting in some ASICs instead of pumps might be smarter than pumping in certain circumstances. Assuming at some point hash rate growth levels out somewhat so the lifetime of ASICs becomes multiple years and assuming the dam is in a region that never has real shortage of water (upper reservoir never fully depletes).
But then again, it's probably peanuts on the grand scale of things anyway. And it's not like many new dams are being built these days. They'll all have pumps already.

TBH i don't even care about the block size increase segwit brings. I would have been fine with less or 0. My nodes will manage but it's not unimaginable that decentralization will suffer anyway which is bad for Bitcoin.
But I'll have to trust the devs that they researched that enough to have made the right balance. The other advantages segwit brings are undeniably great and required for any further development of Bitcoin.


We can continue this in a year. Tired of pretending this is about politics and compromises and voting.


Give a finger eat your whole hand?
If you want things separate, you can have the blocksize increase last. Go fix malleability first. Fix the UTXO create/destroy imbalance first. Fix the quadratic hashing problem first. Enable a new class of light clients first. Improve script updatable first. Do preparations for Schnorr and SA and MAST first. Do all the other things in forgetting that segwit fixes first. Then in 5 years we can talk about block size increase.
There's not a single valid opposition to any of the things segwit does. Repeating lies technobabble is not helping your case. The rollout of segwit is going perfectly well and producing a nice flush of stuck shit in this community. Scammers are going to have to start preparing alter egos for their next round of scams soon, as Ver and Zander and other rbtc puppets are quickly running out of breathing room.

Unfinished versions of untested code were rolled out, promised to be golden but turning out as horse shit. Bugs were found and holes were exploited, clients were DDOSed, testnet exploded, scammer supporters and devs were outed and silently left, live versions were constantly being patched. Each incompatible with the other.
Three utterly failed hostile hard Fork attempts later they still have absolutely zero to show for. Not even useful data on how NOT to do things, as that was already blatantly obvious to anyone with half a brain. Completely incapable scammers.

Bigblockers have had 3+ years to develop an alternative. And what do we have? Nothing. They did nothing. Nothing but stupid ideas and false promises. Not a single one worked out into a decent peer reviewed BIP with well written and tested code.
Instead that are 3 (three) competing non-compatible versions of untested bug laden and security vulnerable pieces of junk still changing consensus code every few weeks, while never having been tested or a single spec written.

If that were true, the Bitcoin experiment would be over right now.


Only for setting in stone a particular transaction order. Nothing more. That's what they get paid to do, that's all the power they have. Giving them any more power (even if it's in your own mind or the mind of those you confuse) is the wrong road to go down. Users have all the power.

Yes there is. Small is relative and there are airways a few that are small, which are the next in line to be pushed out. And i don't even care whether they mine in a pool or form their own small pool or whatever.


It's not just about bandwidth. It's CPU, RAM bandwidth and storage, DDOS resilience, being able to stay below the radar if governments and mafia etc.


Higher fixed costs, proportionally more for smaller operations.  i.e. centralisation.


And there we go centralisation.
So, on your own you mentioned all the bad factors that you say lead to centralisation. Bigger blocks speed that prices up as well as place the decision making the hands of the big miners.
So you've identified it all, but you're too daft to draw the only logical conclusion? Why is everything upside down in this world for you people?


Because that's the definition of decentralized. It means everybody can participate, not only a central elite.
Now we know perfect decentralization is probably not practically feasible as the guy on the camel's back in the middle of the Sahara will probably not run a full node. But allowing 90% or even 50% or even 1% (sufficiently distributed) of the population to participate is a shitload more than the 100 (probably less) miners elite currently around the world kept in check by a dwindling number of full nodes.

@_date: 2016-12-02 13:26:12


Very much does. And this cost does too.


Only if they're not fake.


Then you need to do some more thinking.
Full nodes keep an eye on the network to make sure rules are not violated, raising the alarm if that happens: "don't accept this money". The more people that do that, the harder it is for attackers to pull shit off. Full nodes add security to the network.


That's just nonsense. You need plenty of soldiers to make an attack infeasible to begin with. Once an attack is underway you're too late to prevent series damage. Besides if you make full nodes to costly now you can't suddenly add more full nodes when you're under attack.
Besides if you're not running a full node you're trusting others to warn you when something's wrong which itself is syllable and abusable.

Everybody has their own numbers and since this is a decentralized system, it will have to automatically come to an equilibrium around the aggregate. Nobody knows and certainly doesn't get to say what those numbers are or should be.
When someones number is surpassed, they have many options and thanks to SegWit one more. The more options and stretch, the smoother the fee market can find its equilibrium.

Sure sure. Except you have produced exactly 0 of those 500, pricing you're wholly incapable of getting things done that you yourself say are easy. In the meantime you have managed to riddle your code with glaring amateur grade security holes as well as blow up testnet for BU and taking down classic with you. But not too worry because nobody noticed for more than a month and after denying any problem for a few weeks you simply ripped out the code completely pretending nothing happened. Coincidentally ripping out your horrible version of a hack around one of those problems that segwit actually fixes.
The only thing that positively offsets your scamming and intoxicating newbies with lies is the fact that you are doing the same to your boss. You are scamming him out of your paycheck and much more money plus costing him endless amounts of good will. For you it will just be yet another abandoned software fork under your belt.
And all it costs you is the effort of dreaming up empty promises. Clap clap.
Also amazing how you achieve writing down those ten points of either lies or complete misunderstandings on your part, without actually saying anything. What's 9 supposed to mean? Did i not just glance over your blog blabber where you suggest introducing new opcodes to magically and easily solved ask the world problems (yet have not produced anything towards that other than the claim "should be easy to do")?
And let's end with the endlessly milked lie, why don't you?


What troll doesn't get enough of hearing that nonsense one not time?
And the fact that "a competing solution" doesn't exist at all. Despite a year long of your promises. Nothing. You have nothing.
You waste your (everybody's) time on plagiarised ripoffs of 2012 era ideas that were already long superseded before you started on them. You oversell those with deceitful branding and shake oil lies. Calling it finished and superior to actually finished, simpler and already proven better solutions. By the time you finally get it into your thick skull that xthin is hopelessly shit, you silently do it and come with the next regurgitated piece of crap rebranded as xpedited. Rinse and repeat. Straight from the scammers handbook.
You're a transparent scam, Zander. A pathetic con artist set on leeching off the hard work of giants with zero of your own effort and zero consideration for scientific and human progress, or the damage you inflict on them.

If you're already losing half that money you might want to ask wether it's possible to earn back at least more than half. Or sell the equipment for more than half to someone else. 
If you're planning on hodling, then you should compare it to directly buying Bitcoins and hodling those. That's always a safer bet than mining, except it depends on how easy it is to buy those coins near you and at what price. I understand Venezuela is a bit harder than most other places.

If it fits 3.7MB transactions, that's 3.7 MB of transactions. Which is 3.7x the current number. Exactly like a 3.7MB block. which it is. No way around that.
What you mean is that it's not the same as a plain 3.7MB hard fork. Which would allow 3.7MB no matter what type of transactions. But such a HF has many problems and none of the benefits of SW and would never reach consensus in the current climate, not even a mere 2MB, let alone 3.7.


Ok, so it's established that the block size does increase. Thanks.


You're saying that quite confusingly. It's not that SW allows ~double and then another 1.7 for certain types of transactions. It allows 3.7 if pretty much the whole block consists of "certain types of transactions" and hardly any "normal" transactions.

Not sure what's so political about node count TBH. Something that's fundamentally unmeasurable BTW.
Technically (game theory) it's important for there to be as many economical full nodes as possible. Sure, if 90% already are, then 1 more or less is going to be not a big deal. But since it's unmeasurable and clearly nowhere near 90% today (everybody and their mother are using APIs or SPV wallets) it is very important to keep a close eye on any variable that could possibly affect incentives around full nodes.
Those are very technical reasons. Even though maybe ultimately to avoid political problems (amongst others).

Yeah i can definitely see the logic in that. I was tending in that direction myself before SW and LN came along. It sure started to look like it was not a smart thing to scale bitcoin (block size) at all. Pure "onchain" scaling alone certainly never was an option, in my understanding of bitcoin.
As a non millionaire gold doesn't have much direct appeal to me, although logically i can see how a digital stable gold can be useful to humanity. (Or doom us all.)
And in a big sense LN actually does exactly that: bitcoin is the gold, LN is a layer that allows instant secure trustless payments of that gold. That's how LN reconciled my split trains of thought. Seeing as how SW enhances the LN experience a lot, it would make sense if this group doesn't block SW.

Economic users (with their full nodes) need to let miners know what they want. There aren't any reliable sybilproof methods for that communication, but in practice updating your full node is a pretty decent one. Letting the miners know out-of-band is also an option.
Miners have to judge (through the noise and sybil attacks) what the economic majority wants and act accordingly. Miners need time to sift through the noise and prepare their own systems. It's only healthy if that takes a bit of time.

That's not true. Your node detects and warns about the presence of transactions and blocks it doesn't fully understand.

@_date: 2019-08-23 01:22:21
You were clearly duped.
SegWit was invented and developed by Bitcoin (core) devs. By the time it was finished and tested, Litecoin devs copy/pasted it and applied it to their (otherwise also 100% copy/pasted from Bitcoin) codebase. And because Litecoin is completely centralized and run by one guy, it was easier for them to roll out. Whooptidoo.
LN was an independent invention building on Bitcoin script (which coincidentally is copied by basically all in shitcoins, so it may theoretically work on some of them too, but almost none have even tried, let alone succeeded). The initial theoretical concept didn't require SegWit, but the actual LN software in existance uses enhanced constructs only only using SegWit and checklocktimeverify enhancements put into Bitcoin since. And further BIPs (yes, Bitcoin, not Shitcoin, Improvemnt Proposals) are in the works to make LN even more efficient. Most shitcoins don't even have SegWit or CLTV, let alone keep up with other code changes, so all of those will never run LN. Actual LN software is being built by basically Bitcoiners (none of them have any affiliation with any shitcoin) and for Bitcoin (they're not actively trying to block shitcoins, but since no shitcoin devs have the skills to get it to work and keep up with the changes, in practice it's only Bitcoin).
Very very far from the picture you're trying to paint here. Scams do not deserve the light of day, let alone active white washing.
\&gt; if a technology for an alt coin seemed desirable, it is totally  conceivable that that concept could be implemented by BTC if there was  consensus.
That has been one of the selling points when the first shitcoins came out. Yes, any tech created outside could possibly be integrated into Bitcoin. In practice nothing from other coins has flowed into Bitcoin. What is flowing into Bitcoin is honest research and hard work, which is coincidentally not pre-funded before non-delivery by selling worthless tokens to suckers.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:48:38
\&gt; because a large blocksize that is  empty will still require whatever users it does have to pay the same  high fees, otherwise miners don't mine.
False. If blocks are not full, miners will be forced to mine the minimum above 0 fees or not mine at all, making the coinbase near nothing and thus security goes to shit. Blocks MUST be full for Bitcoin to work at all.

Yes they will be full very soon after a change. Miners would be crazy not to accept any non zero fee transaction and demand for perpetual distributed storage is simply infinite. History shows this too, blocks have pretty much always been full to the (soft) limit of the time. There were many other lower limits than 1MB over time and you can easily spot them by looking at a block size graph and seeing it jump from plateau to plateau. And that's considering that bitcoin was relatively inconspicuous and unknown, the fees amounted to nothing compared to the block reward and the spam attacks weren't as intense.


There absolutely no room for such politics in bitcoin. It's science and full consensus or status quo. If status quo means the end of bitcoin, consensus will come eventually. If political deals need to be made the whole Bitcoin experiment ends right then and there.
They can block segwit if they want, that's fine. Saying it's because they want a block size increase would be transparently dishonest and hypercritical as segwit IS a blocksize doubling. A block size increase factor larger than any increase before in Bitcoins history. But if they think they can maintain that dishonest lie without that minority shrinking from further dissent then by all means they should try.

Is it litecoin shill season?
No! Litecoin is and always was from the very start a clear scam. From the premine to the "ASIC resistant" to the "faster" to the "silver" sales pitch bullshit. It never innovated anything, it's merely copy/pasted code from Bitcoin, only sometimes a little before it was rolled out in Bitcoin.
It's also as off topic as all other scamcoins.

Clearly you were lied to.


Wow. Clearly you're being lied to still. You should do some investigation into who is lying to you so much and why your still believing them. Maybe so reading their forums and running their software completely. Sounds like serious scammers.
In the meantime, the people who have NOT lied to anyone have built this thing that gives you more than 2MB capacity in a fully backwards compatible and opt in manner, better balanced UTXO incentives, decreased bitcoin complexity and technical debt, and will make future updates easier.
You should read up on it sometime.

Processing one or two blocks doesn't mean "the network worked fine". A car that can drive a mile or two before breaking down is not "working fine".
Anything short of "guaranteed to work for at least the next 100 years in the worst possible malicious circumstances" is absolutely unacceptable and most certainly not "working fine". And even Bitcoin can't guarantee that, which is why many smart people are still working on improving it. Breaking things as quickly as possible by doing stupid shit is left as an exercise  to shitcoiners.

Miners don't have the power to drive up the price, other than asking a higher price for the coins they are selling (but they're not the only ones selling).
Also the mining profitability is unrelated: if mining is not profitable for them they will just have to shut off their machines and possibly stop their business completely.
It's all purely supply and demand. The price is whatever people are willing to buy and sell at. And supply is limited.

\&gt; Why are adaptive block sizes impossible on the bitcoin network?
Because it can't be done in a manner that is not gameable. Obviously. Because a protocol running in many computers memory can never in a decentralized manner (i.e. all computers coming to the same conclusion independently) come to know parameters from the physical world. Apart from the single one parameter that Satoshi used to build Bitcoin: POW.
\&gt; Monero has several bitcoin core devs working on it
Sorry for their waste of time then.

Feels very much like you're taking things out of context now. I doubt they said "never". And i know at least two who sold prefer less than 1MB today, but who are making a compromise with segwit to even increase instead of decrease. Not ideal, but at least SegWit makes that safe enough in their estimation to agree with SegWit.
Also segwit gives enough wiggle room for long enough to explore LN and other solutions.
And i totally agree with them. LN promises many orders of magnitude scaling as well as new user cases. Without downside to bitcoin. In contrast every byte of block size increase is an extra cost for all nodes for eternity, regardless of whether it's worth it or not: it's a cost.


I can't believe that's something a core dev would say. It may be a way of describing segwit in some context. But it's simply not true.  All data remains inside the block. The Merkle root still covers all of it, even if it gets reorganised a bit. You need all that data if you want to fully validate the block. No way around it.
And yes that amount of data can be more than 1MB, so therefore the maximum block size will be higher.

And then the hashrate goes down making it cheaper to mine and then there is one miner that does decide to mine. Thus the users got their transactions in for near 0 fee, but they end up with one single miner that is able to outcompete all the others. Decentralization gone.
Blocks MUST be full.
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:57:16

Tons of things are illegal (or indisputably bad if you don't like law) with or without malicious intent. 
Most victims don't give a fuck whether they were killed because of malicious intent or not.


Of course. Agreed. I don't see anyone accusing him of "malicious intent to hurt" here, so you're moving your goal posts to off topic.
Who, other than a very rare sociopath does have intent to hurt people anyway? Robber of the shop on the corner didn't intend to put the shop owner in a wheelchair, he just wanted money. The drunken driver didn't intend to drive over 3 school girls. US didn't invade Vietnam with the intend to hurt people.
The intent clearly was (easy) monetary gain (as usual). As was the case with MtGox (he and his (invested) companies could get their money out).
And today (i.e. every day over the last few years) he's being completely irresponsible with his attacks on Bitcoin. Aiming for easy money to swindle of newbs in his altcoins.

You clearly don't know what forks are. In Bitcoin there can be soft forks and hard forks. Neither ends up in two or more incompatible chains. Bcash is not a Bitcoin fork, it's an altcoin (and shitcoin and scamcoin). Completely independant and irrelevant as far as anyone with half a brain is concerned. And even completely non-existant to Bitcoin nodes.

Yeah, we're both not saying non-ecash cases are impossible or all undesirable. Myself, I can probably only think of OpenTimestamps, as I haven't looked into any others (other than seeing lots obvious nonsense around) but there may be others.
Intuitively I would expect most or all of those use cases (if honestly and smartly built) should be possible 99.9% offchain. Like opentimestamps does (minimal on chain space usage) or for example using smart contracts to hook in a separate P2P network similar to what LN does. I have not enough knowledge of what Microsoft is doing to judge that. 3 letter acronyms usually end up in my kneejerk shitcoin bin, at least initially.
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:27:43

Are you really reading me the 2014 sales brochures of those centralized, premined, always obvious (and since long proven) scams, to try to convince me of something?

\&gt; But if Bitcoin is supposed to be  permissionless, then why do we need people to label transactions as  either spam or legitimate? The feemarket should take care of this.
We don't and it will have to, once the subsidy is low enough.
\&gt; The system is supposed to be robust.
Fees are the only thing that protect against Bitcoin blowing up and breaking down into centralized useless mess.
\&gt; And aren’t you hindering honest users by reducing the blocksize as well?
Nobody is reducing the blocksize. In fact it has been increased and is still growing.
\&gt; Fees will go up for everyone.
That will first push out spam and people who incorrectly believed transactions would be free. After that there might be legitimate pressure to increase the blocksize and maybe there will be consensus to do so.

We're talking about money here. People losing money by falling for scams. That's like allowing promotions for pyramid schemes on a banking conference!
And then there's the fact that bold claims require proof: if XT claims to be superior, they can prove it by growing just like bitcoin had to. They don't need to be provided with a free lunch off the back of the hard work by the people they are screwing over.
You don't invite the people about to raid your house over for coffee so they can go through their plans and sweet talk your wife into assisting them. 
How is bitcoin ever going to be worth anything if it doesn't defend itself against quacks and scammers?


My point being they assassinated themselves. I reached that conclusion without reddit influence.


The stress test people are assholes but yeah if that would have been a problem for bitcoin then bitcoin wouldn't be worth a damn and it would have been over by now. Those stress tests proved that the block size cannot simply be increased. Because the next stress test would simply fill those blocks too. I don't see how anyone can possibly come to a different conclusion. The only possible defense against stress tests is higher fees.

Let everything go to shit and then throw in an emergency fix once it's too late. Great.
\&gt; we should limit blocksize with a simple soft-fork
I.e. completely centralized by definition. And soft forks still require more consensus than one idiot (i.e. you) suggesting some random change.
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:46:28
That's impossible because of squared hashing. But yeah you'd think the bigblockers would have made a viable sirensthe proposal by now. All they have though is 3 incompatible pieces of buggy shit (proof: they forked themselves off testnet and didn't even notice for s month). No specs, no designs, no peer review, no testing, no consensus. Full of security bugs. Unfinished with monthly incompatible changes to live code.
In other words there's no alternative to SW and apparently nobody is capable and willing to make one. Which makes perfect sense because SW is clearly the better solution to fix many problems at once in a super elegant and clean manner.
@_date: 2016-11-10 01:03:47

\&gt; Miners can simply not include transactions without fees.
No they can't. They'll go out of business.
\&gt; There is the possibility of the unconfirmed transaction pool filling up  if there are a lot of attempted transactions without a fee.
No there's not. No fee (and too low fee) transactions wouldn't even make it into the mempool. They get dropped.
\&gt; But those without a fee can simply be purged after a day or so. No fee to miners, no reason to keep you in the pool.
Right, that's already how it works today. Doesn't support your case though.
\&gt; Miners already decide the block size
No they don't. They will use the maximum that's possible, otherwise they go out of business.
\&gt; Miners maximize their profit on investment by Bitcoin actually working
Yeah... again doesn't support your case.
\&gt; you seem to think that they are incredibly short-sighted.
Seems like you are: artificial minimum fee -&gt; long term out of business. artificial smaller blocksize -&gt; long term out of business.
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:28:23
He just basically explained to you that it's not about the number of transactions alone. Batching significantly reduces the number of transactions making it look "worse" while it's clearly improving. And even when looking at number of outputs instead, things be deceiving because batching also reduces the number of change outputs required, which reduces the number of outputs. A lot of other efficiency improvements have similar effects and can be similarly hard to quantify.
The calculation seems indeed wrong to me too, not sure where that's coming from (looks like someone forgot to divide by 24hours). With [ I come at around 11 outputs/s.

The "spam" that would fill the signature space is of a whole different calibre than the down we see today. It doesn't bloat the UTXO set (most important). Also the squared hashing problem is gone, so it wouldn't have a big effect on validation time. It would simply be just a one time larger block. Bad, but not a dealbreaker if it didn't happen too often. If it does happen very often, then a simple soft fork can be rolled out to reduce the 4MB (raising would have been hard fork, so best to start high). It wouldn't make sense for miners to include it in the first place, but i guess if the spammer posts enough they might.


Like Schnorr, MAST, SA and more.


Well that's predicting what proven and highly qualified experts are going to say in a year. Especially considering the complete lack of any experts contradicting them. I'd rather just await that and judge their reasoning in due time. It's always easy to lower the 4M to 2M with a soft fork and then double the base size through a hard fork.

Bullshit. Only their arguments and proposals were gently bulldozed. As gently as stupid shit can be bulldozed. They were given ample opportunity to come to their senses and were never forced to rage quit. They all dug their own graves deeper and deeper.


After having halfassedly proposed 20GB, 20MB, 8-4-2MB and all other bikeshed rainbow colors. All without proper code or specs or peer review or even good arguments for why that random number was better than the one before or better than 1. All with words like "trust me, I've tested it all out last night on my laptop, 20GB is no problem whatsoever". Yet lateron even bigblocker jtoomim did his "research" and concluded 3 or maaybe max 4MB was the absolute max. (Ignoring all proper studies done already.) Gavin admitting he was wrong? No way, he silently dropped one proposal and shouted another one, without any reasons whatsoever for why it was suddenly lower.
Also, SegWit has turned out to be implemented and tested and peer reviewed and deployed faster than any of those proposals as it's right here today and those others are nowhere to be found. So much for "buying time".


Ah, the universe and its laws.. so mean to those who want to build faster than light and get-rich-quick machines. Bitcoin is dead toast the second wishful thinking takes over from science, so take it elsewhere.

Miners don't decrypt hashes. Decrypting hashes is not a thing. Neither is decrypting signatures. Cracking signatures (i.e. producing a false signature) is not something mining hardware is set up to do, but even if it would, the amount of energy miners spend (or ever will spend) is not even a blip on the radar of what's required for even cracking one signature.

I don't think I have evidence other than hearsay. To an extent i guess it's impossible to prove either way, as miners have plausible deniability of they "get caught".

Ideally, they would sooner or later all independently reach the same conclusion and safely roll out the soft fork in their systems (no need to rush either).

2% is not negligible at all. It's also at least a big part of (if not more than) what miners make after expenses. Regardless, it will be 4% after the halving next year and 8% after the next halving (assuming no other changes like more transactions thanks to SegWit and other improvements).

I don't believe that to be true. Everything pre-SegWit is still valid. I think the fact that even miners that don't update can still continue to mine pre-SegWit blocks and everyone will accept them without problem, proves that.
Maybe if you make some really braindead transactions today involving NOP opcodes. But they'd probably not be safe pre-SegWit either.
This is why we're blessed to have smart devs at work going out of their way to develop these soft forks in such a way that they're safe and don't invalidate old transactions. You may have seen nullc hammering Zander and BU for recklessly doing the opposite.
Well designed soft forks and their activation procedure also provide ample warning beforehand and opportunity to close any channels or bedside drawer transactions that might get invalidated. Seeing as how monitoring the network is already part of the job of maintaining a payment channel, I don't see why keeping an eye out for pending soft forks would be a big deal.
So your argument boils down to that some retarded evil dev (say an idiot like Zander) could create a badly designed evil soft fork and get it activated. Like I said, if that happens Bitcoin has bigger problems than a few payment channels and sockdrawer transactions. Bitcoin would be dead.


Nobody is arguing that confirmed transactions aren't safer than open payment channel transactions. Of course there's a tradeoff. For one, you would use smaller amounts of money in payment channels, to cap your risk.


Easily over 1 or 2 hours, statistically once every few weeks or so? But whatever, let's not get hung up on your 1 hour claim.
Bitcoin in startup fase with block subsidies still providing the overwhelming majority of income. So much so that lots of pools didn't even bother optimizing for fees. Satoshi built Bitcoin such that it will have to be funded by fees and no subsidy. Waiting for such a fee market to develop until the mining subsidy is too low will result in chaos for sure and in a huge change in fees that you were just complaining about. Most devs intended to let the fee market slowly kick in much earlier than it did. Gavin and Mike Hearn screwed that up by increasing the block size too quickly every time.
The fee market is forming right now. Software (wallets etc.) are learning to deal with it. Prices are stabilizing and, despite what you say, getting into the next few blocks requires a pretty predictable. You're overpaying a little compared to someone who is okay with waiting 10 or 20 blocks or a whole day or a whole week. But that's exactly the point of a fee market: those in a hurry pay more.
And overpaying a little is not a problem for payment channels as they're already saving lots of fees by the caching they do. It's also possible to change the fee with every in-channel-transaction. And note that one-sides close transactions can have a higher fee than mutual close transactions. So you're only overpaying in fees if the other side isn't cooperating (not always evil, but it means most of the time you're not overpaying and thus you can afford the extra security of a high non-cooperative fee for the one time it is needed).
LN also has the feature where a party maliciously trying to close a channel risks losing more (all) his money in the channel if the legitimate final transaction makes it to the blockchain (with higher pre-determined fees and possibly aided by CPFP).


Backups are always possible. And LN allows for (multiple) third parties (or your own server in your mom's basement) to monitor channels and close them when something bad occurs. If I'm not mistaken they're also building it such that you can recover your channel state from one of the monitoring servers if necessary. Still without the monitoring server needing to know more than it should (i.e. pretty much nothing) about you or the channel. So monitoring servers (that you need anyway) serve as automatic backups as well. Lots of stuff is deterministically derived and/or stored in very smart merkle tree ways (can't think of the name right now, amazing little data structure), so it's actually not much data to keep track of


Kind of lost track of where this thread started, but yeah nobody is saying they are as safe as 6-confirmed on blockchain transactions. Nobody is saying there aren't a lot of practical issues. That's one reason payment channels are hardly in use today (yet). Another reason is chicken-egg: useless if nobody else uses/supports them.
LN will hopefully make a big dent in both those issues: watcher services actually make things a whole lot safer and more usable. LN (especially with malleability fixed) solves a whole lot of annoyances and practical little details/risks. It might also carry enough momentum to enough people started using them and enough wallets to support them, which breaks the chicken-egg problem and kickstarts a network that will spiral more robust and more useful as it grows. Bidirectional helps a lot too there as it makes a huge difference in the amount of netting that can be done and therefore fewer closes of channels.
We'll have to see if LN can deliver on its promises, but as far as I can see it's looking awesome. If it flops then maybe Bitcoin was just never meant for sub $100 transactions and we'll have to see how far the blockchain can scale and how useful Bitcoin can remain despite that.
So to recap:


Yeah, a little. But not by normal soft forks. And the risk is minimized by quite a few safety measures. Low overal value. Paying a relatively high fee on one-sided closes. Penalty risk for a malicious close. And whatever risk remains is reset to its minimum with every new transaction, as the fee is adjusted to then proper levels.


"open for hours or days" after the last transaction sounds fine to me. Also note that LN allows for pretty long timeout periods. You don't need your transaction to confirm within a few blocks. Thanks to relative locktime, it can actually be a day or more.
I'll take the risk of somebody DOSsing the whole Bitcoin network for 2 days straight to then have a shot at robbing me of my $50 channel, while I still have a chance of winning it and taking 10$ off of him.


I'd argue a well functioning fee market actually makes it better. In 2015 it was easy to DOS the network with spam and clog things up for hours/days. These days that's a lot harder and this will improve further as the fee market matures. Predictability of the highest tier (within a few blocks) will be much much better than it ever was, as that tier is the hardest (most expensive) to disrupt with DOS attacks.


I debunked that already above.

\&gt; I  was pointing out that telling a new comer to Bitcoin that the only  purpose of the Blockchain is Bitcoin is disingenuous and you could have  explained to him your points in that last comment so he knows what to  look for in future Blockchain projects.
Telling a newcomer other blockchains out there are scams and dumb (even when hypothetically one day it may turn out there is an exception) is 500% more ethical and safe for everybody than the alternative of throwing the newcomer into the shark infested deep end. If I'm wrong, nobody loses. If you're wrong, you've just ruined countless lives.
And how you can bring up stuff like DOA as a usecase is beyond me. That was obviously a scam and doomed to fail even before it did fail 2 weeks after its introduction. Same with the whole of eth.

When node 2 gets unbalanced it starts to raise its fee (in that direction, while reducing (even negative!) its fee in the other direction) and if you don't pay it you can't route through node 2 anymore. Then you can try a different route 1-4-3 or you're out of luck.
Low or negative fees mean that someone else can jump in and very cheaply send money the other way (-3-2-1-) and then your attack is basically subsidizing cheap transactions for someone else 
So either you pay for all fees for opening and closing of all intermediate channels _plus_ your own two channels _plus_ some overhead and then everybody is happy. Or you don't pay. Either way your attack fails.
The bucket analogy isn't too bad. Instead of one big pool of water it's more like a bucket with thousands of small randomly interconnected chambers in it (and no air bubbles). If you want to extract water from one side you have to push it in on some other side. The water flows whatever way it needs to.

You made your claim before we started talking about rbf. Clearly payment channels do work. Alice just needs to make sure every payment includes enough fee before accepting it. Then she can unilaterally close just fine.
And your nonsense about soft forks insisting transactions is nonsense too. Clearly that would be an evil fork which wild be rejected or bitcoin wild be dead anyway and invalidated payment channel transactions wild be the least of our problems. 
You have a habit of coming up with technicalities that sound interesting and packing then into a nice technobabble story that makes it sound impressive and worded in a FUD maximising manner.
But it's all deceitful transparent bullshit.


Bullshit. Fees were never predictable to time scales less than an hour even if just because there is predictable that sometimes there are 0 blocks in 1 hour. How wood you even begin to predict the fees for 0 blocks? And to even without touching on your allegations towards "the evil people that dared to redesign the fee market". Which of course is also a load of crap since that never happened as fees were designed by satoshi himself. 


Really now? That would be a non backward compatible softfork then? So you're trying to instill fear around the soft fork topic by saying it's possible to propose evil forks. Bite size portions for rbtc trolls to copy from eh?


Really now? So apart from being logically incorrect (as well), that statement is somehow supposed to prove payment channels don't work?

Blocks are always full. But the fee level varies over the day and/or week. This helps the participants in the transaction by moving most of their fees to a lower fee level. It also helps the fee market as a whole by taking pressure off an already busy moment by delaying it. That evens out fees for everybody, making them lower and more predictable (less need to overpay).

That feeling of "wow, I just discovered a whole new insight, mind blown" and then jumping down the next rabbit hole to find out where it leads to. I'm probably butchering my explanations of the rabbit holes I've been down to and people who've seen many more can probably point out errors and subteties. Always looking for new ones though, which will definitely be the case if you prove me wrong here. Not there yet though :)


I'm not sure it's "only" but yeah, Bitcoin needs to somehow morph from the current subsidized situation to one where it can sustain itself at good enough security. And that future is not even a 100t years out, but approaching soon after maybe 2 or 3, maybe 4 more halvings. Either way, yeah we agree we are talking "long" term here. We're not that concerned about how Bitcoin works and is secured today being a toddler. We want to try to foresee how it would look like as an adult and hopefully nudge it in the right direction if possible.


Still think you got that slightly wrong: blocks will keep coming no matter what. They might slow down if hashrate drops real hard (like currently it's actually faster than 10 minutes because hash rate keeps climbing). Now if hash rate does go down that much, the security will go to shit and people will have to require more and more confirmations. Yes, at some point that may be unworkable and only useful for niche and nerd use cases, in which case you might say Bitcoin just failed.


But there's still that 1 mn txn backlog of "normal" users paying minimum fee, right? Then why would a miner keep the block 99% full and no earn the extra 0.1 BTC by filling it up too?


ok. I can give you that there are situations where that may be (at least temporarily) true: the two that I can think of are (1) charity of the level you're talking about (temporary), or (2) continuation of the subsidy by cancelling future halvenings. Both seem pretty unlikely and probably undesirable.


I can't see how that would really be a market. Sounds more like a committee coming up with a number (or guesses by wealthy individuals) and then actually paying for it. I could imagine big companies or some inividual whales or maybe even whole countries that have a big interest in Bitcoin surviving to throw some tips every now and then to keep miners incentivized to do the right thing. Sure, but I doubt Bitcoin can be relied upon to survive on only that.


I think the rabbit hole you just found is leading you to the conclusion why extreme bigblockers were clearly wrong. You're basically saying it yourself: charity is required. 


Indeed and that's one of the reasons why they're pure scams: they're promising users things they can never deliver and they know it but lie about it. Roger Ver was already doing that with Bitcoin before bcash was a thing. He promised free transactions for everybody in the world. Well, then we ended up with a lot of disappointed users when they had to learn that they were promised lies and those that couldn't deal with that started bcash.


No: the chain never stopped. (Well it eventually will (pretty quickly) when you make it infinite block size)


It's voluntary of course, but they're kind of forced to IF they really want that tx to go through. They'll stop bidding higher and higher when they think it's not worth it anymore. That's the whole idea of any market, I think. (and the same on the supply side: miners stop if they think it's not worth it anymore)


That's basically something along the lines of: the desired security hashrate divided by avg hashes per Wh divided by the avg price in $/Wh divided by max transactions per block. You can make decent educated guesses about some of those variables, but then you're left with what's the desired level of security? And indeed the BTC/USD. And those two are actually not independant either: a high BTC/USD means a transaction is moving a lot of money and therefore needs more security. If BTC/USD is not worth much, it can do with lower security.


Remember that that control is fairly limited. You've already said infinite is not going to work and there are clear physical upper limits (storage, bandwidth, and most importantly: time to do an Initial Block Download). We're constrained by the laws of nature.


I think that's the wrong way around. You can't demand nature to give you something at a certain price. Nature dictates the rules and whatever rolls out of that is what you get.
Roughly: larger blocks means more transaction can go in and thus lower fees. So blocks should be as large as possible. "Possible" being the key word. Whether fees end up at $1, $10, $100 or $1000 is not really our choice to dictate. $1 fees will certainly be a very different Bitcoin than a $1000 fees Bitcoin.

There is something through RPC as well, although i don't know the details. Depending on what you're doing with it, it might worth it to find out though.

No, cause the old nodes will see the new blocks as valid and this the new chain as the longest (most work) of the two forks and will follow that.
So at worst an indiviso miner could scree up and create such an invalid block and start a fork. But he will quickly be outpaced with other blocks and even his own node will pick the longer chain and assume his own block as orphaned.
That means the miner who has his stuff misconfigured will ensure an orphaned block every now and then (costng him money) but the network hardly notices anything and everything keeps working fine.
So the difference is the occasional 1 or 2 block long fork that then automatically resets back to the main chain. As opposed to one invalid block causing an eternal fork that a certain % of hashing power will forever try to build upon.
Note how either of those failure modes will NOT happen with segwit. If a miner creates an old non-segwit block it will still be accepted by ask other miners (new and old) and nothing bad happens. So not even that last 5% of miners is forced to do anything, they can just keep running years old versions and lose nothing (except more fees of the larger segwit blocks). So new blocks are valid for old miners and old blocks are valid for new miners.


Correct. This is one of the safety features that altcoins often to our out mess up when they fuck around with blocktimes and stuff. Claiming it's an improvement while it's actually removing a safety feature.


Unintentional is probably never good. Contentious is also bad, although a properly designed soft fork can be very backwards compatible and not force anything upon anybody. Like segwit.
A hard fork by definition requires everybody to update, by a specific date without any leeway.

I hope I'm right about that, but I'm fairly sure. Unless I'm missing some sneaky trick, a signature must match something and is therefore pretty much like random noise (similar to how a hash looks like a random number).

That's actually not that important. Wouldn't even make sense if it did. What is important is a healthy supply/demand market for block space where people in a hurry pay a premium and others wait a bit longer. Neither should massively overpay, which currently happens a lot and causes the erretic fee spikes. Stable predictable fee levels. Once that's there everybody can decide for themselves whether their use case is important enough to pay those fees or either wait longer or use alternative layers.
Cheap is nice, but only as long as decentralised.
Fee level and even block size are not parameters we can pick and choose. We can only do our best with what the universe gives us.

No. There is no "one [who] could charge" in Bitcoin. Doesn't exist. There is nobody charging at all. Miners don't charge, they only collect voluntary donations. Charging implies setting a price. Miners don't set the (fee) price.
Miners just sit at the gate and let all the highest payers through until your parking lot is full (see the word full here?). They let everybody else wait outside. And if there is nobody else left that means the parking lot is not full hence the highest paying cars will tell themselves: "that was a complete waste of money, next time I'm paying less".
Fees going to zero means they approach zero, i.e. they'll end up minimally above zero. Of course fees will never be actually 0. A miner will not spend the effort of opening the gate for a car paying 0.


Maybe, although in practice most miners probably would not take 0 as even the latency of sending a few bytes around and loading them into their ASIC in the end is not completely negligable. Besides, saying no now means that maybe that same transaction will get a higher fee in the next hour and there's a slight change that same miner gets it then. Either way, it's quite uninteresting as the subsidy is going away fairly rapidly, so we're talking about a future steady state adult system.


"Work" here means the work of downloading the 200 bytes transaction, sending it around their network, spending some microseconds of CPU to validate that transacion and incorporating it into their Merkle tree and uploading that into their ASICs. It does NOT mean (part of) the Proof-of-Work work. The POW work is exactly the same if they put 1 transaction in or a thousand. That one extra transaction makes no difference at all.


That simply means that all miners that don't have that other advantage will go out of business and then only the ones that do have that advantage are left. So of those a miner that does not fill his parking lot will be the next to go out of business.


That splitting a fundamentally badly (quadratic) scaling blockchain into multiple individually equally badly scaling sub-blockchains with added complexity and overhead and excuses to hide centralization behind. Makes no sense.


Whole of Bitcoin (and thereby decentralized blockchains) hasn't been proven yet (as a steady state self sustaining healthy system). As for scaling, worst case there will be bitcoin banks (centralized to the size of countries or cities or communities or industries). Crypto exchanges are already like that. At least they'll be limited to hard money instead of a money printing press and bad actors can be replaced by new ones thanks to low barriers to entry for newcomers (like political barriers and corruption). That's already an improvement over the current fiat system and anything beyond that is a bonus: hooks using smart contracts (multisigs, timelocks, etc.) that limit the bad things those banks can do, minimizing the trust they require. The transparency and free market choice they can be demanded to provide. And then stuff like LN and maybe some other similar "sidechain" sort of things. And quite possibly many more things that haven't even been invented yet.
In practice it will be a mix of all of those things competing with each other.


You're going from an ideal utopian idea and then putting requirements and restraints on the method to get there. That's not how the universe works. You don't even know that ideal is possible at all within the laws of physics, mathematics and game theory.
Bitcoin is a careful attempt at building a method to get as far as possible in that direction, where both the method and the ultimate end goal are not completely known yet. The method is improved upon daily but with the knowledge that it's extremely fragile and probably a once ever chance of getting it right.

If you make up unrealistic examples, you can get any outcome you want. "Imagine there are only 10tx per 10 minutes" -&gt; makes no sense, there will either be millions if fee is tiny or there will be so few that Bitcoin basically failed. "And all 10 pay 1 BTC fee each" -&gt; Makes no sense either. It's charity for no reason and there will always be many other transactions that pay at least the minimum, so those would get included too.




Well those will likely be there if bcash is worth $1 and the fee is 1 bcashsatoshi then I will have a few TB of harddisks to backup. But way before that the whole system would collapse already anyway from the insane load, just like eth is hopelessly collapsing right now.


We also have to keep our rivers and oceans clean, even when we do ore mining or build factories. We also have to not burn rainforests.


That's not an outrageous thing in a lot of ways (and it is in at least one way for some). The first thing I thought coming into Bitcoin is that it would actually be more fair since people that only Hodl basically don't pay fees yet they arguable get more value from the system and need the security much more than those that transact a lot (in and out in hours). So the way to let hodlers also contribute would be inflation.
If the fee market actually fails, then that might actually not be a bad way to give Bitcoin a 2nd chance. I can't remember now, but I think I've heard a really good argument against inflation though, basically showing that a healthy fee market really is the only way and that inflation would not lead to a stable equilibrium. I may misremember that though.


Me too, but if there's really no choice between failing completely and moving to inflation, then consensus might happen. And consensus could mean to fork off into Inflacoin and continue the experiment there.


Yeah but the thing is that level is different for everybody. And that's the good thing about having flexibility and options in space (make transactions smaller using segwit/schnorr/taproot/batching) and time (wait a bit longer for a confirmation) as well as alternative layer 2 solutions (LN, Liquid and other sidechains/layers). The trade-offs will be different for everybody.


For each person indivifually, certainly. I've looked ahead for myself and have decided to never backup my many TB harddisks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Too expensive.

As any maximalist, I always keeps an open mind to new applications or maybe even better coins. However, clearly none exist today and it's very unlikely one ever will ever.
You may think blockchain is some magic buzz word that solves everything. Most people go through that phase, some even get stuck in it. The truth however is that it's just a very inefficient way of doing something that any 40 year old centralized tech could do way better. That something is determining the order of transactions.
So only in a situation where you need \_decentralized\_ ordering of transactions, is it of any use whatsoever. In computer science the term "transaction" is quite broad, however it so happens that you not only need a blockchain, but also some other things like POW and the surrounding incentive structure. Turns out that only works when the tokens are actually worth something, restricting things on the blockchain to financial transactions. So yes, its only use case is money.
One valid other use case is opentimestamps, but that is piggybacking on the existing Bitcoin system, it's hard to imagine that could exist as its own blockchain.
Another reason it's only for financial transactions is that the only thing in the physical world that can possibly be validated independently purely by software running in the virtual world is relative energy consumption. That's what POW does: it proves to software which chain tip has the most work put into it, such that the software can make a deterministic decision which to follow to arrive at the same state as all other instances of that same software.
That means that weather reports or election results or real estate documents or ICO shares or whatever other info from the physical world have absolutely no place on a blockchain. The software can't tell truth from lies anyway. Eth is basically the dumbest idea possible in the entire space.

They actually don't always. Simply sending from one channel to another could do the trick. Or paying some service provider through fiat to send some sats to your channel.
Of course there are plenty of onchain solutions too, many of which have a (much) lower than 1 ratio of onchain transaction vs number of rebalanced channels.

@_date: 2017-11-25 14:36:38


Sounds like an abuse of Ockham's razor. A theory must be able to deal with valid criticism or doubt remains.
He's pointing to a valid scenario it seems to me. In the early days the network must have been pretty thin maybe causing new nodes to take a while before finding a peer. Or a software update or internet outage causing multiple nodes to disconnect and later reconnect at roughly the same time. Maybe simple day/night patterns or multiple people reading/hearing about bitcoin and starting up at the same time.
Also: once two have started at the same time they can stay in sync for many spikes, it doesn't need to restart for every new line.
I think you should be able to measure the distance between the dots on one of the lines and work out if that correlates to one or more nodes working on parallel extranonce spaces. At a certain difficulty there will be for example on avg 20 valid blocks per extranonce space. If you find a spike with 40 is likely 2 machines each searching their own extranonce space starting around the same time. That should result in a "thicker" but not much steeper line, I think.
Steepness roughly means combined hashing power (relative to total). Thickness roughly means multiple machines.
Last time i looked at this data a few months ago, i distinctly seeing a few lines that were clearly 2 intertwined lines of different or very similar steepness.
Anyway, that's just my first thoughts after reading nullc's argument on synced starting, which i hadn't heard before. Maybe I'm just rambling.

You're confusing distributed and decentralized. Very very different beasts.
MySQL can actually be very distributed, they call it replication. Obviously not if it's "MySQL database" singular.
BitTorrent is decentralized (at least the process of exchanging files, not the searching of them so much).

"Securing the network" is a bit of a meta effect. It's not as direct as Proof of Work. But the recent attacks have shown nicely that full nodes rejecting them protect everybody from getting bamboozled by counterfeit coins like bcash and b2x and bgold.

Read what he said: 


that means: "in a way that is psychologically _unhealthy_ or _abnormal_; compulsively."




Singular, not plural! That ONE


So that's almost 4 MB of signature data. With ONE transaction.
That's an attack. That's one completely useless transaction that fills an entire block. That's blatant spam. That's bad. Good thing that it's very expensive to make and no sane miner would mine it.
Schnorr signatures reduce the size of signature data, but an attacker wanting to waste a block with 1 transaction only will just not use Schnorr or add more Schnorr signatures and go back to 4MB.
If you want more than 1 transaction in a block you have to reduce the signature data by 4 bytes to allow 1 non-signature byte in there and the total byte size quickly drops.
Or looking at that another way, just as a random example: if you have ~4MB signature data (as in Jimmy's example) and you introduce Schnorr and say Schnorr reduces the signature data by 1MB then you get back 1/4MB ( = 0.5MB ) space for non-signature data, making the maximum achievable block size 3.5MB.
"Normal" blocks (without Schnorr) will likely be between 2 and 3 MB. But the point is that Schnorr will strictly result in smaller blocks, but still with more transactions in them.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:56:41
Yes, and that makes the lie only more egregious and obvious:
* it's 90% of unoptimized (where Bitcoin was already optimized to 85% or whatever) AND
* it's 90% of HALF of the total AND
* they make a trade off where they screw up the latency (which is the more important metric in this context) AND
* they claim it to be their own genius idea and code, while it was ripped from old (already abandoned because inferior) some core dev's experimental repos AND
* their implementation has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to make their entire optimization moot.
So they deliberately lie about how good (bad) their product is and about how it's optimizing the wrong thing.
It's easy to lie with statistics but once you see through that, it makes it easy to see that they're deliberately deceiving you, so you know to never ever trust anything from their mouths again (hence my post). Of course this was by no means the first time either. They do exactly this over and over again, so most people knew this years ago.
But then their target audience is of course newcomers with fresh money to swindle. The sooner those realize the deceit, the better. Again: hence my post.

4MB adversarial case with spam blocks. 2 to 3 MB "normal" usage (and lower once Schnorr kicks in), once near 100% SegWit use.
Otherwise: oh yeah, no question about it. I keep looking for people to buy my b2x coins, but nobody wants them.

He's trolling.
Core already rolled out a blocksize increase more than a year ago but it kept being blocked by assholes like Ver, Jihan, Silbert and Voorhees. It still activated a few months ago though and blocks are now larger than 1MB and growing. The b2x debacle (same people) added another month delay. But that problem is now mostly over: the assholes made themselves irrelevant and are no longer in a position to create much more delay.
So SegWit will continue to increase block size and in the meantime Schnorr and MAST and Signature Aggregation are being worked on which will roughly halve the transaction sizes. And LN will start rolling out soon.
Good times ahead.

It just had one. Ok, it was delayed for a year through sabotage by powerhungry assholes, but it still happened. It definitely doesn't need another one right now.


And one just happened.
And upgrades are on the way that will roughly halve the transaction sizes (how is that not better in every imaginable way than a block size increase?)
And it's still part of the "roadmap".
And are you saying just because it's on the roadmap we should just close our eyes and ignore the facts and studies and common logic that dictacte that it's dangerous and then just hope for the best? There's no such thing as a "roadmap" to begin with in decentralized open source development. Certainly not one that promises something stupid because someone didn't know better and then does not adapt to new insights.


I doubt next year, Schnorr and MAST and Signature Aggregation are much more useful and effective first. But yeah, maybe the year after that. Sure why not. Nobody is really against it if and when the time is right and all the other puzzle pieces are in place and it's safe and there is consensus.

The Graphene people (or anybody else) are free to implement it and try it. Even on the live network. Block propagation is not consensus critical so if some nodes wish to use Graphene and others use CB and others still use carrier pigeons, that's all fine.
But as nullc explained here, and many more times before in discussions with the BU people trying to steal code and credit and glory with their plagiarized, buggy and falsely advertised XXX fastblocks (I forgot what they named it) : Core thought of, created and tested many of these alternatives over the years and ended up at CB. That doesn't prove it can't be done better, of course.

It's quite plausibly only a few blocks. The million is just nonsense, rounded up or down is irrelevant. And "can't know for sure" is no reason to throw random numbers around.

Another thing you can impossibly know, so why bother speculating and suspecting?

None were premined. That's what the newspaper reference was for and the fact that the early difficulty was so low that hours went by without any blocks at all proves that Satoshi showed plenty restraint in mining himself.

You're right about that. :)
You say timeout of 10 minutes. But when is a node to start that clock? When it receives the latest block: what if there was a delay (possibly on purpose) and the node got the block too late? What if my node finds a block after 9:55 minutes, but you're node says: "too bad, 10 minutes are up." ?

Good point.
Although looking at that red-blue colored graph, there are definitely quite a few spikes that are both blue and red... Did someone very randomly only spent coins in half of their blocks or is it proof (or an indication) that they actually 2 or more actors?
Could definitely use a higher res version of this graph.
I can't really comment on the 1 million thing either way, as I haven't done any counting. He may have simplified it a bit there.


Agreed, but at the same time the chance of that "coincidence" happening might actually be higher than it seems initially, for some of the reasons mentioned earlier (day/night etc.) as well as that we're talking here about a clock that ticks every ten minutes (or as I understand, often even a lot longer at least during the first year). So there are decent size windows for such coincidences to be considered "at the same time".


I think we can all agree there, and nobody can prove it was not a million. Just as nobody can prove that I don't have a million.

Have a bunch of post-its and cut some of them up into quarts. The small ones are signature data and the normal size ones are non-signature data. Write 1000 on each piece of paper. That's the number of bytes they represent, small and large: they're both 1000 each.
So remember: the number of the paper is the number of bytes. The size of the paper is the weight.
I don't remember the exact numbers anymore, but let's say one transaction is 50% signature data.
So place 10 normal post-its plus 10 small ones on the table in a large square: that's your full block. That's your maximum weight. It's 20 pieces of paper, so 20 x 1000 bytes.
Now let's assume Schnorr halves the signature data, so cut each small post-it in half and write 500 on each. Then again put 10 normal and 10 now tiny ones on the table. Your square is now smaller, which means your block is not full, so add some more transactions (1 normal + 1 tiny) until it's full again.
Now add up the numbers.

One confirmation is not always "consensus reached". But even that doesn't matter. If it rejects a block because it has invalid transactions or the block is too large or anything else, it still rejects the block just like any other full node and the owner of that full node will not get bamboozled out of his money. The owner is still fully protected.

@_date: 2017-11-06 22:59:04


Yes. But I'm saying if you reduce the transaction size by shrinking/removing signature data (which is what Schnorr + SA does) then the block size will become smaller. You can add more transactions, but those too will have less signature data, but because the non-signature bytes have 4x weight, you run into the 4M weight limit.
    500KB non-sig data = 500 x 4 = 2M weight
    + 2MB sig-data = 2M weight
    = total 2.5MB data for 4M weight, non-sig to sig bytes ratio: 1:5
Let's say Schnorr+SA halves the signature data (fictional number, I'm not up to date on it) : 1MB sig-data.
    0.5MB non-sig data = 0.5 x 4 = 2M weight
    + 1MB sig-data = 1M weight
    = total 1.5MB data for 3M weight, non-sig to sig-bytes ratio: 1:3
so now you have 1M weight left, so you add more 25% more transactions:
    0.625MB non-sig data = 0.625 x 4 = 2.5M weight
    + 1.25MB sig-data = 1.25M weight
    = total 1.875MB data for 3.75M weight
Still a bit of weight left, but the block size dropped from 2.5MB to 1.875MB, you're not going to get over 2MB in the new situation (on average, normal transactions, etc.)
MAST has the opposite effect, as it reduces the non-sig bytes, which weigh 4x. So MAST will increase the number of transactions and also increase the block size. Not by much though with current typical transactions, as far as I understand, but it will allow for more complex scripts without increasing the transaction size. So that's fine too.


For sure :)

I can assure you that once the puzzle pieces start falling together it's a many year long roller coaster ride of learning and discovering amazing new facts and perspectives on Bitcoin and many related fields.

Hoping to wear out the patience of people actually trying to help the learning.


I'd say yes, but you'd be silly to blindly take my word for it. Just be aware that those dirty games are being played (even if you're not sure by which side).

So yeah... Learn more. And at every step: when it sounds too good or too simple, it's probably a lie.

Maybe he sent x dollars to the exchange planning on buying 1btc and then the price dropped $100 so now he has 1btc and a free fancy lunch without fee and fat tip for the waitress.
The point is on average people pay a fee, otherwise the exchange wouldn't exist. Moving money costs money. Exchanging money costs money. Moving bitcoin costs bitcoin. No reason to act so surprised or outraged about that.
He happens to be posting this in a time where the fudding and whining about prices by shills is peaking and getting very boring. Hard to tell from just the post whether he was doing so on purpose or just passing by. Better be honest and tell him right away that the blockchain is not free, which is the lie scammers like Ver use to lure fresh suckers into bitcoin.

"efficiency" was clearly used here in the context of transaction rates and speeds and scaling and the costs that it take to get to high levels of those. The blockchain obviously isn't efficient at all in that regard and it likely can never be.
Hopefully it can achieve decent rates/speeds/scaling at reasonable cost, but it's always going to be less efficient than a central server with a database. Other layers on top of Bitcoin however may mitigate this somewhat or hopefully mostly.
Yes, in the context of regulation and censorship resistance, Bitcoin is actually quite "efficient", but there's no comparison, since no other such system even exists (or all previous such attempts have failed).

There is money involved afterall, so why would you not expect conmen and vultures to circle around newcomers eager to spend on get rich quick promises?
So yeah... Learn more. And at every step: when it sounds too good or too simple, it's probably a lie. If this stuff were simple it would have been invented in the 60ies just like most of the other fundamental computer science. There's a reason some people have been working on creating digital cash for multiple decades and many earlier attempts failed.


I really doubt that, but me know in a year if you've found something and by then still think so.
Good luck on your quest, I can assure you the rabbit holes are awesome if you allow yourself to go down them and not get cocky halfway thinking you know everything.

The most important part of "helping the network" is making sure invalid transactions and invalid blocks are rejected so that the miners can't play dirty tricks and no hard or soft forks are rolled out without everybody noticing and rejecting it. Doing this is in the direct interest of the owner of that full node, but a whole web of such interconnected full nodes provide a nice shield against shenanigans.
A less important part of "helping the network" is providing bandwidth, storage and CPU. Of course it's important that enough nodes do that, but once there are enough, it's fine if many other do a little less. There are varying degrees of doing less, block-only being pretty much the lowest.

As far as I understand that's tunable and since it's optimized for the latency sweetspot, it may well be always better than Graphene, as that seems to optimize the wrong thing (bandwidth only).
Either way, by the time that becomes relevant graphene will have had the chance to prove itself. Or not.

Just a silly idea: would it make sense if all nodes on first startup pick a random reasonable M and N &lt; M. Then "ban" all IP % M == N
Maybe only if the node is already well connected. Maybe only "ban" incoming connections.
Maybe even do the modulo on each octet of the IP separately.

Rule one is move the Bitcoins to a new address first. Only then can you gamble to try to do anything with the old private key and move the bcash.

First of all I don't need proof, it's fucking obvious: if they use a bad random number generator they can have your private key no matter how airgapped your shit is. Or if it's merely buggy you just have an invalid private key and you still lost all coins ever sent to it.
Second: only the first of many hits on a 5 second google search from one of smartest guys in Bitcoin: [
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:35:06
Like I said, that's provably false: the max block size was just increased last august. They worked on that update for a year (which is very reasonable) and then the activation was blocked for almost a year, but it is now active and has been since august. Now users that feel they are overpaying on fees have the choice to start using it. If they don't, then obviously the fake drama "muh bigger blocks now or the world will collapse" was fake FUD.
One of the problems with bigger blocks is that when you do a sudden increase the fee market completely collapses because of an abundance of space. So the fees drop to 0. Bitcoin's security (both anti-spam as well as more fundamentally) depends on fees being reasonable and relatively stable. It's been taking years to finally get to a sort-of working fee market, although still most people are overpaying. Completely disrupting that market will again delay that process for several more years. So slow demand driven uptake of block size increase is much better than a sudden jump. This way people have a choice when they want their transaction confirmed: pay more or be more efficient.


So, first of all, they already have. Second: they have something even better in the near future pipeline: instead of doubling the block size (with all the extra overhead and load on CPU, bandwidth and disk space and other problems that come with that) they have some performance improving updates that will reduce the transaction sizes. So instead of doubling the blocks size, they halve the transaction size. How is that not better in every possible imaginable way? Again: not forced, user choice and non disruptive update. Look for Schnorr signatures, MAST and Signature Aggregation for these updates.
After that, Core still has (and always had) block size increase on the road map. When it's safe and uncontentious and in due time.


The "they" are the bigblocker-shills and conspiracists. None of them have ever been able to explain how exactly Core (or usually the narrative changes to Blockstream by now) is going to make money on small blocks (other than Bitcoin becoming a huge success... don't bigblockers want that?). It makes no sense. Core wants Bitcoin to become a success, but things don't happen overnight and to become a success huge amounts of work still need to be done carefully and slowly. One slip up and the whole thing can tumble down. The bigblockers just want to get rich quick by to tomorrow and every day delay needs to be blamed on somebody else, preferably the people that are actually doing the work, as the bigblockers themselves don't produce anything at all: not even the hint of an alternative.
Core are by no means "smallblockers", as explained above. If someone thinks they're not going fast enough there are two options: help them (work/money/research) or for an alternative group of experts and build a viable alternative. So far bigblockers have done neither: it's all talk and promises stemming from a complete misunderstanding of the tech, culminating in exploding testnets and live forks, all the while sabotaging actual progress.

Check again. It is.
The way you think it's implemented would be just utterly dumb, so maybe you should do a step back and imagine people who know what they're doing have been working on this. Instead of keep attacking this strawman that only you can see. Some humility would suit you. This is going to happen a lot more often as you learn more about Bitcoin (which you won't if you keep attacking a dead end alley).
And you're on your own now. I've told you 5 times already that you are barking up a 2 year old debunked FUD tree.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:45:47
Correct. Signature data is already discounted. Then Schnorr reduces the size of signature data. That means a bit of space is freed up and new transactions will fill that space. But those transactions are partly non-discounted non-signature data. 4 signature bytes need to be saved to fit 1 non-signature byte. The total weight will still fill up to 4M, but the actual block size will shrink some. But still more transactions will fit in the block.


No worries.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:06:29
So a scammer promised you an infinite number of free transactions for eternity and your ignorance fell for that, but now you are blaming Bitcoin for not delivering? Are you also complaining to mother nature that you can't fly?

I already gave you a counter example. An example intended to teach you something and make you think deeper. Guess you're not ready for that yet.

Cool. Thx. You're re-energizing my curiosity in this. I was doing this stuff a bit a few months ago as well. :)
A few random thoughts from back then and/or now:
 *  I think it would make sense to have a graph of the difficulty in here too. But even more importantly: the total hashing rate. Some features in the graph are going to correlate with a change in hashing power/difficulty.
 * Looking at only the first few spikes in your graph, i can already see a few "lines" that are half spent and half unspent. Not saying it means much, but that's interesting.
 * I can also see "lines" where one point is little bit to the left of a point that was below it. That by definition does not fit "the pattern". Those points are either random single blocks (likely by another actor) or they're part of a second "line" and what appears to be one line is actually two lines (by likely different actors).
 * One "line" starting at 0 and then running for a while and then resetting back to 0, which seems to be a restart of the mining software only indicate "same actor" if the reset to 0 is right after the peak of the earlier line and the lines have similar steepness.
Gotta run now. I'll look a bit more later.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:19:17


Wonder where you got this from.
Schnorr will make the signatures smaller, which means blocks will actually get smaller, not bigger (even though they contain more transactions).
A 3.8MB block would actually contain very few transactions and is far from optimal, if not an outright attack.
MAST will cut down on the script size a bit, but that's a fairly small improvement, but then those bytes weigh more, so the effect on the transaction rate is still significant.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:42:11
Bigblockers are fake drama. Core was the first and only to implement a well designed, peer reviewed and tested block size increase and did so as fast as humanly possible while still being careful and responsible. Then they rolled it out more than a year ago, but activation was sabotaged (by bigblockers.. imagine that... bigblockers blocking a blocksize increase...) for almost a year, but it eventually activated successfully in august. Now we have larger and growing blocks. Growing with as fast as users want it to. Of course certain (run by bigblockers) companies and sites still refuse to make use of the block size increase (imagine that...) because their drama was obviously not about big blocks to begin with. It was about grabbing power and control all along.
In the meantime bigblockers were wasting time with obsolete, buggy untested shitty one-man hack job pieces of code that were supposedly world class, but kept exploding in their faces. Nothing worked, test nets exploded so often that they stopped testing completely, fork threat after fork threat sizzled without anything happening and then they finally made the jump with bcash which immediately exploded on difficulty adjustment (because kindergarten level untested code) and despite a pump plummeted in value. And then immediately the biggest threat was pumped and pushed, but of course it didn't do anything it promised it would, so it was abandoned last minute. But then a few dumbasses didn't want to abandon it so they kept going and guess what? The biggest explosion so far: it completely exploded even before it was supposed to happen. Another full retard bug proving total incompetence for the world to see.
So then they jumped back on on bcash and hard forked that, again. Still not fixing the problem, but who cares. The pump turned out to be an expensive loss and every true believer lost a shitload of money. Which of course were NOT the leaders like Ver, FakeSatoshi, Jihan, because they're too chickenshit to really put their money where their mouth is. And now the losers are mad, but they have nothing left. So all they can do is troll and send in droves of shills with intensified fake news and lies.

Because it wasn't and still isn't finished. Because it was and still is an experiment that's in beta. Because it's a whole new frontier in science where nobody yet knows what is ultimately possible or practical, let alone how to build that.

Counting humans is the wrong way to approach this thing. The universe doesn't owe us anything. Either it's possible or not, we can only make it as good as we possibly can. Breaking it sure as hell doesn't help anyone.
Scaling that far on chain clearly is beyond impossible, so we came up with L2. We'll have to see how far scaling L1+L2 can go over the coming decade or more and maybe we'll come up with a nice L3 as well.
Or maybe L3 will just be a PayPal like solution. Not ideal, but still better than fiat and, if regularly settled through L2 and L1, with limited risk.

I've already told you twice now and it's super simple. Last time:
Non full blocks means miners will put in transactions with very low fee (near 0) because why wouldn't they as it's free money that they would be giving to their competitors if they don't. But seeing others getting confirmed for near 0 fee, why would anyone ever outbid that? So non-full blocks -&gt; fees go to 0.
And that also already explains why miners can not make non-full blocks: that's the same as leaving money on the table for their competitors to grab, so they will go out of business.
And stop trying to extract credit from "other cryptocurrency", centralized and/or disfunctional scamcoins in no way whatsoever teach you anything about Bitcoin (except for how NOT to do things) and it only proves that you don't know what you're talking about.

But connecting to a node that is not incentivized to be there and will be the first to drop off (or turn evil) the second any trouble starts, is not much of a redundancy. It's not about the transactions per day, it's about whether you have an incentive to keep your node running.

Your friend got bamboozled and doesn't know what he's talking about.
Nobody is against larger block sizes, once properly implemented and scientifically proven to be safe. Core were the first and only to do exactly that: a block size increase, more than a year ago. Unfortunately it got delayed by saboteurs (like those that bamboozled your friend). Nevertheless, it actually activated last august, so now we have larger (and growing) block sizes. Further block size increases are on the road map, but before that happens there are actually several way smarter scaling methods in the works. Instead of increasing block size (and load+overhead+centralization pressure), those methods either decrease transaction sizes or do the equivalent of write caching to reduce the number of writes to the blockchain.

So you are the person who decides what logic is viable or not?
But don't worry. I have news for you that will fix your flawed logic. You're using the definitions all wrong.
Soft fork means backwards compatible update without any risk of a chain split.
Hard fork means backwards incompatible change of rules, where there's still no chain split because everybody takes the new version and the old version is completely abandoned. Possibly the old version even commits suicide. There's nothing left behind to call bitcoin, so it makes sense to start using the new rules to describe bitcoin.
Then there's a third​ option, which does create a chain split, and that's called an altcoin. Old rules bitcoin. New rules... Shitcoin.

Bitcoin can't and doesn't provide any promise or guarantee that it will. So the problem is in having that expectation to begin with.
What to do about it:
1) Have the best possibly fee estimation to reduce the chance of it getting stuck.
2) Monitor your transaction and do RBF with a higher fee if you think it's taking too long (nice opportunity to do batching as well). CPFP is another such option.
Never ever is the solution to promise "cheap instant worldwide payments" to people: that's what scammers like Roger Ver did and why we ended up with people disappointed (and becoming anti-bitcoin) when reality struck.

@_date: 2016-02-19 17:09:45
You need to let go of some of those foregone conclusions, you're stuck in a loop because the steps you're taking are too big. I think.


These miners don't put transactions in the block BECAUSE they have not validated the parent block. If they had validated the parent block they WOULD put transactions in the block and it would not be empty.


Same feeling here... you're pretty close, but missing an important distinction which causes you to think that it's impossible to have a chain of multiple invalid blocks. Which is actually what happened ~half a year ago. And could happen again with numbers like 10% validationless mined blocks by an 18% miner there's a decent chance for that miner to build two empty blocks in a row, both validationless. Maybe once every few weeks (complete guess on my part).


Tell me the reason why you think miners create an empty block and especially what that means regarding the parent block (that's where you go wrong so far). You'll probably say it correctly once you put it down step by step. You're skipping a bit somewhere.
Basically the question is: when Antpool mines an empty block, what does that tell you about what Antpool knew about the parent block? Assuming they didn't mine that empty block just because they felt like it or because there were no transactions available.
Remember that validating is not the same as looking at the Proof of Work hash. Validating is a lot more than that and requires you to download and inspect in detail a whole complete block and do that on your own PC, not by trusting someone else. Otherwise you're using the wrong definition of validating and that could explain the confusion.

@_date: 2016-02-20 14:14:10


Sorry about that. I know i have that problem. English not mother tongue, so bit limited in my word set. Trying my best though. I found where you went off though, so let's fix that. See below.


Just checking cause it seemed like the confusion may have come from there. You're right, it didn't.


Up to here you are completely correct. But you are overestimating how risky it is to build on top of that new block. Remember that (most likely) someone has been working their ass off to create that block. Only because of an obscure or bug or a deliberate (expensive) attack would they be stupid enough to make an invalid block. You can already check the Proof of Work within one ms. Probably 99% chance that the block will actually turn out valid.
FOR YOU it's actually not that risky to build on top of the unvalidated block and it's your best chance of getting paid anything: 99% x 20% (assumimg you have 20% hashing power) versus in case the block turns out to be invalid and you decided to mine on top of the valid parent: 1% x 20%.
For the network as a whole though this is very bad, because in 1% of the cases everyone is actually helping the attacker. And remember that the attacker can send out the valid header but never send out the block so no one is even able to validate the block at all.
And because everyone is helping the attacker there's a decent chance someone builds an empty block on it and then everyone starts building on that etc. Which means the attacker can get multiple confirmations. Which means even if an honest miner finds a valid block instead of the attackers block then still the attacker chain is longer so most (stupid) miners will still be building on the attackers chain.


Here's where you go wrong. You were already mining on the last known valid block but you just stopped it, might as well not have stopped then. Also might as well keep the transactions in too because IF you solve that block fast enough and you somehow miraculously win the race with the unknown block (or that block turned out to be invalid) that is already out there, then at least you'll get some fees too. So that's how you recognise that this is not the case we're talking about with antpool here: this situation would not result in empty blocks.
As a conclusion: note how this is a case where the (short term) incentives for individual miners (get as many blocks that pay out) are NOT aligned with the incentives of the Bitcoin network (reject invalid blocks ASAP so we can trust that 1 or 2 or 6 confirmations are really final). Of course for miners with a bit more long term view (value of Bitcoin to the moon) it's still aligned, but it's dank hard to keep that up when you're the only miner not doing validationless mining.
Also note that the root problem that validationless mining is profitable in the first place is that block propagation+validation is taking too long. If that would take only 1 second (physically impossible but picking an ideal extreme here) then no money would bother with validations mining: 1 second out of 10 minutes is not worth it. This is why it's important to optimise the propagation and validation efficiency (which Core is working hard on) and not increase the block size too much (increase is more than linearly bad for propagation+validation times).
Another measure that is being worked on by Peter Todd is to make validationless mining impossible (or at least force miners to prove that they've fully downloaded the parent block). Which to me sounds like a good extra safety feature. But note that it has the danger of making the underlying problem less visible, luring everyone into a false sense of everything's fine.

Last time I saw I think the estimate was 1.7 (not 1.6) for current conditions and it will rise with more transactions with more signature data in it.
So yeah that's about it for near future. 
Probably not anything near future, but i can imagine with some future upgrade they could use other signature algorithms (schnorr, ring...) that are possibly larger. Or they might put parts of more complex scripts that are only important during signature verification in there. (Although i think they're already working on methods of leaving that data out completely which would be even better.)

@_date: 2016-02-26 01:12:32
Unfortunately I don't have any really good links handy. I should teach myself to keep bookmarks more often.
One of the dangers is that validationless miners (SPV miners) can actually HELP an attacker by building more blocks on top of his attacking block. A bit like in the situation above, except that was accidental.
Note that accidental or not, it meant that some transactions had multiple confirmations suddenly went back to 0 confirmations. It's not hard to think of that as dangerous. If nothing else, it undermines the idea that 6 confirmations is 99.99% secure.
Another issue is that the hashing power can get partitioned. Imagine the Chinese firewall closing completely tomorrow, then the mining network would be split into 65% in China and 35% outside. Both sides would happily keep mining, but as soon as the firewall opens up again, the Chinese chain would be longer and wipe out all the earnings made by the miners in rest of the world. Two effects:
1) Over the long run those lost earnings end up as extra profit for the majority miners. That's a huge centralization pressure: bigger miners means more profit, so smaller miners merge or go out of business. Centralization is bad for security and it undermines a fundamental promise that Bitcoin makes.
2) That lost 35% mining power is really lost. It cost a lot of electricity but it didn't help protect the network. So a 51% attacker would only need to have 51% of the Chinese side to be able to attack Bitcoin.
So the above was a partitioning based on geography, but this is the virtual world, who cares about real borders? What if you knew that about 65% (to keep the same numbers) of all miners were doing validationless mining, while all others are honest and first validate.
Then you can actually activate the partitioning yourself by mining a block but only broadcasting the header and delay the rest of the block. You know that 65% (+ whatever hashing power you have yourself) will be helping you build another block on top of yours and you know that the remaining miners will be wasting their time on a block that even if found will likely be orphaned.
It's like having the keys to the Chinese firewall and closing it for a few seconds/minutes every time you find a block.

3 lies. Every single SegWit transaction increases the block size, we don't have to wait for everybody. "The issue" is not right here right now and that "issue" is not a doubling or nothing. With SegWit people can decide for themselves how big they think "the issue" is and do something about it themselves. Decentralized choice. And if you think"the issue" is so urgent then go tell at Ver and co for blocking and sabotaging the only possible block size increase for more than a year now.


Lie and irrelevant. The data is in the parent applications. Doesn't matter if they made the hardware as perfect as it could theoretically be or not. And it doesn't matter if it's 30%or only 1%. That's all too much.


The bitcoin network is a while lot more than just a few miners.


Yet their greed is much more short term and in bitmains case it's grabbing a monopoly at all cost. Which makes no sense, but that's what happening.

None offer what Bitcoin and by extension LN offer.
\&gt; The fee market also brings an insane amount of complexity to bitcoin.
Blame Satoshi for designing it that way (although blaming him for working within the laws of nature seems unfair) or blame yourself for not understanding that before you went into Bitcoin (or if you listened to Roger Ver's false promises, then blame yourself for listening to a scammer).
\&gt; With altcoins I can create a reliable wallet by simply setting the feeRate to a fixed amount, and propagate.
Are you really so gullible to think that any of those toy scams would fare any better if they'd have to handle even a fraction of the load that Bitcoin does day in day out? Really? Have you ever looked at eth collapsing under its own weight for example? And that's still hardly any use at all.
\&gt; I think we need to aim at a future where fees are balanced between too  low (see: tragedy of commons problems) and too high (see: decreased  utility)
That's what a fee market does. Currently the fee is zero, and we still have a big buffer for growth, so no need to panic every time there's a few transactions waiting in the mempool.

That's not true. Schnorr and SA will reduce transaction sizes, making blocks smaller (in bytes, not in weight) and thus allowing more transactions per block. A 3.8MB block would be an obvious attack on the network and actually be only very few transactions (almost 100% of the block would be signature data).
SegWit is good. Schnorr is good. SA is good. But don't spread falsehoods raising false expectations please.
Signature data is already "discounted" in SegWit, so any upgrade that reduces the signature size is "less" effective than it sounds on transactions per block. But it still saves bytes, so it's still good.
On the other hand, non-signature data is still "expensive" under SegWit, so upgrades that reduce that size (MAST, SA a little) have a much higher effect on transactions per block (except that the concept of what one transaction is becomes muddier and muddier).

Delusion. But not so much by miners.
1st of all: mining centralisation causes miners to become larger to have an unfair advantage over smaller miners. That's the danger of centralisation and that's what the whole debate is about. Miners now chosing to go for doubling (ellegedly) gives you the proof of that effect and that the centralisation is already out of control.
With this increase they will push out the bottom x% of miners therefore earning that much more for themselves.
Miners are trying to hide behind the lie that they're doing it because the users want it. And that's where the delusion comes in: users are easily manipulated with simplified promises. They can easily be persuaded to vote against their own interest.

Still no reason to block the block size increase that's been ready for 6 months. Still no reason to back the proven unqualified and incapable retards pretending to work on BU or classic or XT.


None said anything remotely like that. You want actions? How about they are the only ones in the world that worked hard on safe and honest blocksize increase. They're the only ones that achieved exactly that. No other team has achieved anything remotely ready or even potentially suitable to do scaling. In fact, most of the unfinished crap there was, has been pulled out again because of bugs and design flaws.
Core did exactly like they said they would in the roadmap. Not a single reason exists to doubt their roadmap (not saying healthy scepticism is bad: there's just currently no signs of anything that contradicts that roadmap.
So instead of incremental safe updates that fully incorporate the lessons learned at every step, you are demanding everything to be done at once and within a year. And you demand that from a decentralized system. You don't see a contradiction there? And because of that demand you just block everything.
You're lying to yourself. You don't need convincing, you just need to stop listening to manipulative concern trolls and start thinking rationally. Accept that you don't fully understand everything but recognise that nobody does and therefore slow safe steps are the only way.
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:15:35
Fees are currently zero, so let's wait until we have at least some fees for a while before bringing up "while still creating enough security through fees to secure the network"?
\&gt; Why not just target growth against something like average bandwidth improvement of \~17% per year as Lukejr once proposed?
He's still proposing that. It starts with going back to 300KB blocks and keeping them constant. Block size itself is already a growth rate. The growth of the block chain will then match the \~17% (according to him). I don't know that I fully agree, but at least he has the only proposal in existance based on some actual numbers.
\&gt; Down the road, 10x the number of users paying 15% of the fee they would  have otherwise still pays for more security and generates more consumer  surplus than a no-growth system would.
Unless Bitcoin doesn't exist anymore because people stop running full nodes. See the Ethereum scam.
We can be all hippy about this shit: free unicorns for everybody. Er we can look at what nature is telling us: a narrow rough path with steep cliffs on either side, towards a possibly feasible goal of sound decentralized money, maybe.
\&gt; If we want to collect data then great, but planning for no growth at all  in order to try to generate a large fee market on a deliberately small  user base seems like a recipe for failure in the face of a sea of other  cryptocurrency fighting for user adoption.
There's plenty of growth still in SegWit and in upcoming things like Schnorr, Taproot, efficiency improvements, reduction in spam and offloading small payments to LN. That's already plenty of variables to make any prediction moot. Only once all those factors stabilize a little can we begin to imagine how much may be needed. But even then: if physics doesn't allow for it, the universe doesn't give a fuck about how much we need.
\&gt; Since we’ll never be able to, why do we even need to?
We don't need to. That's the point. But we can't allow it to swamp the network
\&gt; If we can’t build a system that can be agnostic to what the intent of a tx is, hasn’t BTC failed?
BTC is agnostic and cannot be otherwise. Doesn't mean we have to scale Bitcoin just to allow spam to remain free.
\&gt; Spam paying market rate on fees within a total blocksize the network can process safely is just subsidizing security.
So you agree we do need a market rate first.

Even with 1% SegWit hash power the chain will not split, as long as the non-SegWit miners are not actively going out of their way to try to steal money. As long as they just keep mining as they do today SegWit will work fine for those that want it and those that don't won't be bothered by it at all. That's the beauty of optin backwards compatible permissionless innovation.
The issue is of course that SegWit users would like a bit more certainty that miners will not suddenly start stealing their money. That's why they want more than 51% hashing power (95% preferably). Of course they don't want to trust miners like that.
But if there's a chain split then it's not caused by SegWit, it's caused by miners trying to steal money by doing a 51% attack. Which they could do today without SegWit as well.
Viewed in another way: SegWit is specifically within the bounds of the rules set out by satoshi. Everybody already agreed to those rules when entering bitcoin. Miners blocking SegWit are actively censoring innovation. That's Ver for you.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:02:08
The goal is a mature market where there is a decent amount of backlog of people that are smartly bidding low because they're not in a hurry. They can slowly increase their bid using RBF while smartly batching more payments into the same transaction. People that really are in a hurry will have to bid more, but also not overbid like crazy and distorting the fee market for everybody (which was happening a lot end of 2017).
The hard part for all participants is to to estimate the correct fee to bid. But a big part of that problem is that the market is immature and hectic and unpredictable. Chicken or egg problem.
Much better batching, the segwit blocksize increase and some leeway in segwit adoption still left offer a nice dampening effect that should help prevent runaway fee spikes. Which makes things a little more predictable for everybody else. Thus getting us closer to a mature market.
As long as fee is basically zero none of that can develop.

You have it backwards, or sideways or whatever. Not sure where your error is. Maybe you're confusing validation with Proof of Work (point 2 below).
1) The fact that they MUST mine an empty block is BECAUSE they haven't received+validated the PREVIOUS block yet. As soon as they validate the previous block they can also add transactions into the new block and it wouldn't be empty anymore.
2) Note that "validation" means validating all the transactions and signatures YOURSELF. The fact that the previous block has a Proof of Work stamp on it does NOT make it validated. You would HOPE that whoever did the Proof of Work also validated that block, but as we've just determined that's not always true (see 1, or if an attacker makes an invalid block on purpose).


Or there is a bug in your (or someone else's) software somewhere which causes you to keep building on top of the wrong chain. (which happened ~half a year ago). Or maybe an attacker is feeding you a header but not giving you the entire block, so you can't verify. But now you are actually HELPING the attacker by building an empty block on top of his. You're drawing waaay too simple conclusions waaay too quickly. Bitcoin is a lot more complex than it seems.


Not if that empty block builds on top of the longest chain (which may turn out to be invalid multiple blocks back).

Exactly. Blocks aren't full by a long shot currently. Even last year's "stress tests" didn't have any significant effect. Once blocks get full it will push out some low fee spam transactions first. Only then would the fee slowly increase to maintain an equilibrium. But even before that happens SegWit will provide daily increases in blocksize as well as give people a third choice.
Then LN will start to take over the low value cup of coffee transactions, freeing up space. LN well also bring in a huge number of new use cases and users so that will actually increase the demand on the blocksize.
And next on the roadmap are a non-contentious hard fork.

Hi, trying to keep this shorter this time. Sorry that my block withholding thingy wasn't clear, I'll try again.
First of all: remember that the attacker's block doesn't need to be invalid. It depends on the kind of attack he's doing, but most likely his block will actually be _valid_. He's just manipulating other miners into wasting their hashing power: anything wasted by others is direct gain for the remaining miners.
Also, this is a different attack than the one where SPV wallets get false confirmations, don't mix the two.


Well, I meant in the TCP sessions, send almost the entire block to all peers except the last byte. That way in case you do want to spread your block (because you discover a competing block for example), all you need to do is send the last byte to all your peers.
Don't get hung up on the 1 byte detail though, there are probably timeouts, so you'd have to do it slightly differently, but the idea is spread the header as fast as possible, but delay the block until you want it to be known.
Basic idea block withholding attack: find a block, don't make it public yet, build another block on top etc. Once you detect someone else making a competing block, you quickly send your block and try to win the race (hence the one byte thing).
Normally this sort of attack is quite dangerous to perform because you're going to lose quite a few of those races (unless you have 33% then it's profitable in the long run, if I'm not mistaken).
However: if you know that for example 60% of other miners will do validationless mining, that means you can control what they do simply by sending them a header: they will help you. Assume you have 10%. That means there is 20% of mining power left that will not do validationless mining. So if you find a block, you have 10%+60% chance that you or someone else prolongs that chain. IF the other 20% finds a competing block anyway, you can quickly try to win the race anyway (by sending the one byte). Basically what you're doing here is disabling 20% of the mining power (your competition), which means 20% more income for you and the 60% of validationless miners.
In short: if you as a miner could disable other miners hashing power, then you (and the people that help you) earn more.
That means there's also a large incentive for honest miners to also start doing validationless mining, otherwise they lose out (more than the normal wasted hashing power of the first few seconds after each new block.
Hmm.. I'm not sure this is more clear than before. Maybe you should look up blockwithholding attacks.

Nice attempt at distorting the time line. They concluded it was dangerous BY THEMSELVES. Sure Core pointed that out, but they didn't listen to Core. Only until jtoomim pointed it out did the first 4 proposals really get dropped. 
They just didn't have the balls to admit that they had been extremely careless by promising people things that were clearly impossible. Instead they tried to weasel their way into yet another bs project (classic).

Roadmaps of both sides have equal initial size boost.
One side has absolutely nothing else, nor the capacity to keep bitcoin running as it is let alone improve it any further. Merely the promise they'll someday steal the half finished ideas already done by core.
The other side does the same initial boost as a mere side effect of massive and awesome fixes of multiple years old problems like malleability and many efficiency gains. Opening up the paths to new inovations for years to come.
Further more they have the decades of experience and huge and growing amount of man hours to work on further improvements already being discussed right now.
Now guess which side will actually stand a chance to deliver sound money?

It doesn't say it won't have multiple channels open simultaneously, it only says it will rotate 1 of them every 6 months. And it's a very far off estimate when the entire world is doing everything with bitcoin, not something it needs to be able to do in the first version.

He did. He worked hard on the **only** properly designed and fully implemented and fully tested solution in the entire world. It's been ready for more than half a year now.  All alternatives that claimed to be better or easier or earlier or finished, turned out to be piles of shit crumbling under the weigth of their own design flaws, bugs and vulnerabilities at so much as a sneeze test. One by one all abandoned, withdrawn or silently ripped out of codebases entirely without replacing anything in their place.

But non-upgraded full nodes still check inflation for example, so at least that attack surface isn't there. But you're saying a malicious party would simply use another method and reach the same effect. While they're in the business of creating invalid blocks, they don't really care in what manner. Hmm yeah I guess I see your point.

This. From many angles, for example OSS projects often struggle with:

* vultures - trying to ride on someone else's success by hijacking and confusing target audiences: alt coins? private blockchains?

== no consensus. Thanks for confirming my point.
@_date: 2016-02-10 01:28:00
If you think about it all those examples actually show exactly what's going on here too. The easiest to see may be your 150MB diskspace example.
Was that because the IT administrator was a saddistic bastard? It's possible. But he probably really couldn't offer much more. He probably did have more diskspace available or could have easily and cheaply bought more. Why he didn't? He probably had other bottlenecks to worry about as well. Backups for example. Tape drives is pretty expensive. Setting it all up, having enough space. Daily maintenance etc. And every time your space allowance doubled he had to replace the backup shit too with double the size tapes. But then he ran into the next problem: tapes were too slow (the night is only so long)  so he had to get faster tapes. And then the hard disks were too slow, so upgrade all the storage. And then the network got too slow, so upgrade to 1Gb. And then in the potential disaster scenario requiring a tape restore would take 3 days of company down time. So again he had to put in an upgrade of everything and set the whole thing up differently such that a disaster scenario wouldn't mean everything was lost at once. Etc. Etc. And rince and repeat. Possibly in different orders. These same and other bottlenecks keep popping up.
This is very much what is happening in bitcoin as well. Of course there will be changes of the constant, but a shitload of other stuff needs to align with that and be prepared, both in work and technology.
And while we're taking disks, even the evolution of harddisks may sound like a simple change of a constant every x years. Double the size every x years, right?
Not really. Sometimes they make the bits physically smaller so more fit in the same dimension. At some point they make the platters writable on both sides. Sometimes they increase the number of the platters. Sometimes they stack more bits on top of each other, scaling vertically. Sometimes they can't reliably squeeze bits smaller anymore, but by adding error correction codes they still manage to do it anyway. And then the bits on the disc are so dense that the head can't read/write them fast enough so they have to interlace the sectors and later they increase the read/write speed of the heads. And then latency gets so important that is important to speed up the disc rotation. And sometimes they get so much data on the disc but then they run into the problem that the interface to main memory gets too slow, so they introduce DMA and go to MFM and SCSI and IDE and SATA. Etc. Etc. Rinse and repeat.
And another innovation that was required to allow hard disks to scale? Why make thousands of little writes to the same sectors over and over again if you can just save them up in memory and then after a while aggregate then into a few quick writes. Write-cache!
I don't know if you know or not, but that's exactly what Lightning Network will be doing: write cache.
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:38:08
Most of the points I mentioned (and I probably forgot a few) mean that
1) you can implement such an innovation completely independently and without permission, so that you can prove that it works and can be done.
2) Vetoing some random idea of some nobody that expects Core to do all the work, is something very different from vetoing something that's already implemented and proven and maybe even already has users depending on it. OSS tends to be quite lenient to features like that. Even Linus accepts stuff he disagrees with when there's a decent implementation and proven user demand.
3) Even if you can't get it into Bitcoin itself, you can still run it as a sidechain.
4) The Core development team will grow to many more people, distributing the "power" among them.
Regarding mining, you're handwaving real problems and worrying about a non problem. 51% is an existential problem and so is collusion to censor transactions or small miners (stealing their rewards) as well as collusion to do double spending attacks.
Block confirmation times going up because of GFW is REALLY the least of any problems. How about 20 confirmations being undone and "western" miners losing ALL their rewards because someone smuggles across a USB stick with the latest Chinese blocks?
Peter Todd:

No empty blocks are not a problem at all, and I never said they were. They are a SYMPTOM of a deeper underlying problem. An unmistakable data point proving there is an underlying problem.
Just like a cough is not THE problem, but it can be a symptom of pneumonia. 
But keep hand waving away the coughs, just because you don't understand Bitcoin deep enough.


Nice contradicting yourself. It's THE solution, but there is no problem?


Something small miners can't do, so centralization pressure right there.
And you realize that 10% of 10 minutes is one minute, so the difference between getting the blockheader directly from your competitor and getting and validating the block is a full minute. And that is not a problem?
And 2MB filled with transactions with quadratic scaling properties will be not twice but 4 times as bad.
Heelllloooo ? Waking up yet? Seeing the point yet?


It doesn't ADD security (best case) and is actually extremely dangerous (worst case) as the recent fork showed when miners were building on the wrong chain without validating. Causing SPV clients to see 6 INVALID confirmations.
But again, that's not the point anyway. Whether miners do it or not is in their own interest and either we can take measures to make that impossible if we want. In the meantime I don't particularly care that they do. It's the underlying problem that it points to that is more important.

No, security is not the same. In PoW security is not about the number, security literally is the electric energy wasted on finding a solution. And using that solution you can prove to somebody else that you just wasted that much energy. Except Jihan didn't, the proof is flawed.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:45:20
To everyone thinking this is not a problem and miners are free to include transactions or not.
The 10% is not THE problem. The 10% is a symptom of a deeper underlying problem. Which are exactly the problems that Core has been warning about for since before the block size debate even started. The 10% is just another data point proving that Core is right.
One other things you can say about this 10% :
Apparently Antpool's concern about block capacity is all fake: they are happy to waste it. Which means they are interested in bigger blocks for other reasons, which is again: centralization. They stand to gain from more centralization as it pushes out smaller miners.
Which is another data point proving Core's position.

EDIT: I hadn't thought it through all the way. Attackers are even more limited: 


Well let's not get all Hollywood. Yes IF you can hack a node then you can probably get the money from it. But that's a pretty big IF.


Actually a Trezor like device (or a built in TPM module) that keeps the keys out of reach of the OS does make it a lot harder for an attacker to get to the money. If he fully breaks the machine he could start making transactions to himself and steal everything (possibly countered by some sanity checking and risk analysis in the Trezor like device, but still: assume stolen). But a lot of hacks are not full control but rather things like reading random memory, looking for the keys.
Anyway it's certainly going to be a bit of a challenge, especially in the beginning, to set up secure hardened machines to be LN nodes.

There's not a single valid reason you can come up with to do 2MB before SW. But since you already buried your head in the sand earlier you put yourself in a position where you'd lose face if you don't get your demands met.
You've been given plenty of opportunity to get your head out of your ass without much loss of face.

Those techniques allow the miners to get most transactions or even the complete blocks quicker, which means they can also pre-validate (and cache) them. This means once the block has been mined it can be propagated and validated quickly.
Note that Matts Relay Network already does most of this currently. Except that smart pre-validating is the responsibility of the miner himself, which apparently AntPool does an appalling job at (10% empty blocks).
@_date: 2016-02-20 15:08:09


Sorry, i assumed we were talking about SPV situation (should have checked context i guess). You're right about full nodes of course.
Completely stopping mining is also bad, i agree. That would allow an attacker to temporarily shut down the whole network (same effect as having them work on an invalid chain).
The best miners can do is to keep mining on whatever they were mining on before: in case the unvalidated block turns out invalid, they will quickly find a valid one and nothing goes wrong.
The problem of course is that in 99% of the cases that unvalidated block turns out to be valid and the honest miners wasted their time for a 1% chance. It's expensive to be honest in that situation. It's really attractive for them to start doing validationless mining.

Don't think so. Not sure about the details, but certainly not significantly. They're only very slightly smaller.
But the coolest part is that with Schnorr signatures it's possible to combine multiple signature into one. Just like summing two numbers, you can simply sum 2 signatures. And that's not only important for multi-sig transactions: all transactions that have multiple inputs (each input has a signature).
Together with Signature Aggregation this means that it's actually cheaper if multiple people combine their transactions into one because then all those signatures can be summed and only take up the space of one signature. That means things like CoinJoin, which are good for privacy but are currently just a hassle that nobody bothers with, will become incentivized because it's cheaper.

LN node is "the same" as a LN user. (Except a user might not want to route payments for others, maybe because he's using his phone for example.)
The funds are locked in a 2-of-2 multisig account (plus some extra smart contract goodies). Funds can only go 2 ways: part goes to the other peer's address the rest goes back to your address. If one peer tries to cash a transaction that is obsolete (but gives him more money than the most recent transaction) then the other peer can detect this and will have for example 24 hours to publish another (already pre-signed) transaction that will give him ALL the money. Anyone trying to cheat loses everything. Extreme game theory, not just being honest to get the fees, but capitally punished when cheating.
Opening a channel means putting funds into the fancy 2-of-2 multisig address, that is done on the blockchain and will require a few confirmations. That way both parties know exactly how much money is in the channel. Yes LN nodes keep an eye on the Bitcoin blockchain. Likely by running a full node (possibly pruning) I assume.
The whitepaper is a bit outdated (details for the fancy smart contract part have been improved quite a bit) and the whitepaper is more complex than the Bitcoin whitepaper. But there are a few Youtube videos of presentations that should give you a decent idea of the internals.

BS. Core has been working on making the code more accessible (libconsensus, modularisation, cleanups, improved documentation, etc.) for more devs and more modular so that changes and even softforks (versionbits, side chains) can be done more in parallel. Different dev teams can then work on different soft forks simultaneously. Including true democratic processes where users can vote by using a suggested soft fork or not.
The dev centralisation has only been improving since the day bitcoin started. And it will make leaps with the above mentioned improvements. Besides everything has been done completely in the open. Discussions and coding.
The current problem is mining centralisation, which has become a lot worse over the last 2 years.

Even without trust, his post looks perfectly logical. the OP's claim however 1/13th and 100x sound completely rediculous and purposely misleading. As in: even if the tech does what they claim it does, they are measuring the wrong things to get to those overwhelmingly impossible numbers. Typical case of lies, damn lies and statistics.

Whether it should be autonomous and guided by the market or not is debatable, but that argument is futile because the fact is that it currently isn't. It will simply cease to exist when let to its own devices. What it definitely should be is more decentralized (in all aspects), so work is being done in that direction. Maybe one day it will be grown up enough to be autonomous.
@_date: 2016-02-01 01:02:44
It's not even easy either. You can see how classic is finally realising that now, despite XT already choking on it before. Just changing one constant opens up a floodgate of extra work that MUST be done first to have bitcoin not fail completely right away.

I don't think i agree that validationless mining is better than stopping btw. Validationless mining is actually helping an attacker get a longer chain. By stopping at least you're not actively helping (only passively not working against the attacker).

Public p2p network. Anyone can join.
There is no need for POW.


Signed Bitcoin transactions are exchanged, but they're not sent to the Bitcoin network yet. That means the next time you do an LN payment, a newer version of the previous transaction is exchanged to override the old one (with slightly changed balances).
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:34:47
History is filled with ignorant people delaying or even blocking progress. You'd hope was something that only happened in the dark ages but it's all around.
I do have some hope that, after classic fails, more failsafes will be built into bitcoin and especially into SPV wallets that make sure that "lazy" people who don't bother upgrading, don't automatically end up on the attacker's chain. Hearn deliberately blocked some such improvements. Now we know why.
That's the big danger right now: classic is banking on lazy SPV wallets to just not notice anything.
The ignorant mob attack is inadvertantly being strengthened by "lazy" users. Where lazy can simply mean "sick of the troll discussion, minding their own business.".
In normal software projects "lazy" people are a nuisance to the developers and sometimes the world. Look at Windows XP.
For bitcoin the reverse can become true: lazy people can become the guarantee that bitcoin remains stable and its rules get truly cemented. No matter how much apopulist politician promises, he won't be able to persuade enough lazy people to bother updating.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:01:49

There's still a lot of "normal" low hanging fruit. And part of it is that it just takes time to mature. But eventually like in any market: if you can do it better than others, you can save yourself money or turn it into profit. Any tool that predicts things consistently better could help.
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:27:36
1st of all that's not true. 2nd: that's why there's a huge amount of work being done (for years already) on:
* libconsensus - Splitting off the consensus critical code (extremely difficult code very sensitive to fatal bugs) into a library, which easier and safer and faster changes to the remaining codebase. Different teams can work faster on different parts of the code without impacting eachother or risking to blow up Bitcoin with a simple bug. And it even allows for multiple independent implementations (you know that thing Gavin's keeps holding up as a carrot).
* sidechains - similar advantages as above, but allows for even more outrageous ideas to be tested, like crazy cryptography, crazy script operators (Turing completeness?), crazy block size or crazy block times. Again without putting Bitcoin at risk and you don't even need to ask for permission or even go through the BIP process.
* Improved BIP and other dev processes
* versionbits where multiple soft forks can be in flight simultaneously instead of having to wait one after the other. Resulting in much faster and more independant development as well as a democratic effect for users as they can simply vote for or against soft fork by using or not using them.
* Working on safer hard fork deployment methods and different hybrids of hard/soft forks ideas, adding more safety nets so that they become safer to deploy.
etc. etc. etc.
The future for development decentralization is very bright. Mining centralization is the thing to worry about currently.

Who said it's a requirement that is possible to assess by a node? Email spam is not assessable either.
The positive side effect of fees (and one reason why Bitcoin can not work without non trivial fees) is that spam becomes more expensive, hopefully pushing them off. That does not make everything, that falls off, spam. Just like i don't read every single email, even if it's not spam.

Not black and white at all. This Bitcoin thing is about surfing on the edge of what's physically and mathematically possible and get it as best as possible. It's not about dreaming up a wishlist with golden unicorns free for everybody and then blindly hammering at it for no reason.
This whole blocksize discussion was done years ago and it resulted in a blocksize increase plus (much more importantly) efficiency gains with more still in the pipe line. And best of all: it made the bigblock idiots rage quit into their own failure coin. Win-win-win.

It's not the block size that does or does not enable that... it's whatever the fee will be. Efficiency gains (SegWit, batching, RBF, driving out spam, Schnorr, etc.) have much more influence than just block size. 
Either way without block size limit and full blocks, fees will be 0 and thus too low for Bitcoin to even work at all. No Bitcoin, no layer 2. On that side of the spectrum is no choice at all.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:55:23


Who made you the genius to decide that? Where's your scientific research?


Bull shit. SegWit isn't that complex, but it's the first step required for any (ANY possible) other scaling. All other scaling proposals ever done fall flat on their face because they don't fix squared hashing or UTXO incentives or transaction picking complexity or malleability. And anything that wishes to fix one of all those problems is immediately practically as "complex" as SegWit is.


Core has plenty of other further scaling to work on and LN is a completely separate project outside of Core. There are something like 5 implementations beinf worked on and a lot of them are ready to go as soon as the scaling blocking by Ver and co stops.
False political correctness and balanced view and whatever bull you're trying to pull off is not working. A compromise between scientific facts and purposely evil fabricated myths leads nowhere.

I'm not sure why you're replying to me. You got the wrong person.
I know all that you're saying and i fully agree. They are great points you're making.


That's what I'm saying: only if your node is running the exact same software then it's bitcoin, otherwise it's not Bitcoin. And I'm extending that over the time dimension as well: to not just 100% compatible (like some rbtc shills try to argue BU is) it must also be 100% exact same consensus rules forever in the future. Can't have a system that's compatible today but will fork at the first sight of a &gt;1MB block. I'd say then it's already not Bitcoin today.
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:58:53
You're assuming (1) it will centralize around large entities and (2) therefore it will be expensive.
Both are unfounded and even if 1 were true, the bar to entry for newcomers will be so low that it will drive prices down rapidly.
Central parties are at a disadvantage in LN because they have to lock up money in (for them) useless channels. 
Normal users who sometimes receive and sometimes send money can aim to keep channels balanced at 50% making the channel useful for both sides and all the money each side has put in immediately available to spend.
A central party will either have only incoming channels balanced 100% on the opening side, which is pointless and makes that central party useless. Nobody can send any money anywhere in that situation. Or the central party will have to lock up some of their own coins in each channel it creates. Possible but costly.
Either way, they can't be dishonest and they can't raise prices because people will simply route around them for cheaper paths.
@_date: 2016-02-15 13:08:51
An unmeasurable percentage of small miners will drop out. That's profit for the remaining and especially the bigger ones. 
And no it's not about them coping with 2MB. That proves your lack of understanding of the problem and therefore invalidated your argument.
It's about propagation speed around the world and the unfair head start on the next block that a miner has compared to the rest of the network, especially small miners. Bigger miners get fewer orphan blocks by winning that race more often than small miners.

My point exactly. In fact I'd go further: if you run software that is compatible today but not 100.00% guaranteed to be compatible forever into the future, then you're not using Bitcoin. Especially if that potential incompatibility can be triggered by an outsider.
But again... you replied to the wrong post (or reddit is somehow fucking it up).

In other words it's proof that propagation is already taking too long with 1MB blocks and that mindlessly jumping to 2MB blocks ID going to make it even worse. Propagation needs to be optimised and improved before that.

You really think if their code quality is this utter shit (and probably worse: denying everything, blaming it on others and throwing out binary patches), you really think their design ideas are any better?

Maybe I do. Doesn't matter for the point though: you're saying "majority attacking and destroying" is unlikely. I'm saying it's very easy to persuade people to make the wrong vote. In Bitcoin the wrong vote can easily be fatal. So  there you have it.
The question needs to be: which party makes the most sense and is able to defend their position with facts and logic and hard data. Not which party promises the biggest carrot.
And note if the technical reasons and facts go over your head, there's really a simple thing you can look at: non-core demands started at 8GB blocks and unlimited blocks. Then they went down to 20MB. 8. 4 and now 2.
Every single of those steps are proof that Core was actually right. Non-core people eventually realized that "yes, too big is too dangerous right now".
The same people have been promising mountains and been proven wrong by their own admission (be it not by their words) over the course of a year. Why would any sane person trust them now on their 5th downgraded plan?
And even that plan is much much worse than the Core plan that is already steaming ahead.
If not by technical merits, why not make your vote based on the track record of the backers?

I read it. It doesn't make any sense though.
So you have a formal proof that application 1 is exactly 100% the same as application 2. And remains so whenever an update is made.
WTF is the point in making application 2 in the first place?
And until the moment application 2 along with that formal proof (decades? impossible?) is actually finished, everybody running that application is endangering themselves as well as the whole Bitcoin network by failing to enforce the consensus rules and giving attackers opportunities to partition the network for easier attacks.
There's only one possible way that makes sense: help distill the libconsensus part from bitcoind and once it's a separate library, you can use that lib in a thousand different alternatives for all I care. I might even run one one day if it has for example a better wallet or better PoS integration or better LN support or whatever.
If you are thinking about redundance like in RAID systems or competition like having multiple Linux distros then you've completely missed the point. Bitcoin is defined by what Satoshi left us with, anything that can have a different outcome (even potentially/by accident) is by definition not Bitcoin. RAID doesn't work here, it only makes things worse. And if you want competition then you have thousands of altcoins to chose from: not Bitcoin.

1. Because having new stricter rules is nice, but they need to be enforced to make them really useful (otherwise you'd have to wait for many more confirmations and hope no miner will re-org afterall).
2. Correct.


In practice (by design) it's only stricter on details that are currently not used at all in any transaction. It's like we have a whole country and the only law is that murdering is not allowed. Currently only New York has inhabitants, the rest of the country is completely barren. SegWit is about establishing a new city somewhere in Florida and the existing law will be enforced there too: no murdering. But in addition there's an added law: no raping in Florida.
The miners blocking SegWit are taking away the freedom of people to move somewhere else and they're threatening to actively send rapists to Florida.


Yeah, but carefully designed soft forks (like SegWit) only let those new rules apply for transactions that are nonsensical and therefore don't exist anyway in the old situation. You could make a SegWit transaction today, but it wouldn't make any sense and nobody does and no miner would mine it unless they change their source code.

Thank you, for showing that you're taking the time to read and think about it.


Why would they do that? Throwing away free money? They certainly didn't do that half a year ago when things went wrong. I agree that it would be much better if they did what you say, but I don't think there's any way to force them.


Yes it was an expensive lesson for the miners, luckily. That was the positive thing about that event. But it was (and still is) also expensive for the whole network. For weeks there was a red banner on bitcoin.org saying not to trust even up to 6 confirmation but to wait for 30 (or whatever they said)
Whether 30 is correct and fully warrented or not, I don't care: the fact is that the calculation everyone used to be doing on how low the chance of x confirmations ever being reverted turns out to be wrong. 6 is no longer the astronomically small chance that everyone assumed (based on straightforward math). They now need to factor in the chance of an invalid chain growing mutliple blocks. That's a cost that has to be born by the whole network as well as making the whole Bitcoin system slightly less useful. No matter how many confirmations they required before, everyone should realistically require one or more extra now.


That's certainly what I heard back then. I don't think any of the miners really complained. They knew they were on the wrong chain, but they also knew they already made more money on validationless mining than this event cost them.
Also: please note that again we're still just talking about the symptom (and its direct consequences) of empty blocks here.
The deeper problem is that larger miners get proportionally more benefit from validationless mining than smaller miners. That means a large miner may get for example 2% extra income by doing it, while a small miner may only gain 1%. The problem is that the pie is still 100% and not 103%, so the net result is that miners that don't do do validationless mining will lose that money (3%). That pretty much forces everybody to do it. And if everybody does it then the smaller ones will still lose money and thus be forced out of business. ( = centralization pressure, with one monopoly in the extreme case.)
Now there are always economies of scale where larger miners have some benefits that smaller ones don't, so a full solution is probably out of the question anyway. But it's certainly important to try to make the playing field as level as possible. In this case taking away validationless mining (as Peter Todd is working on) might help quite a bit, but we shouldn't forget that the deeper problem is that the block propagation apparently is such that validationless mining is even worth doing.
Looking at it from another perspective might help grasp the issue: Ideally blocks would reach and be validated by 100% of the miners within 1 second. Unfortunately it's physically impossible, but I think everyone can agree on it would be an ideal situation. In that situation validationless mining (for half a second on average) wouldn't make sense to begin with. In that case we wouldn't even have this symptom we're discussing here (high number of empty blocks) to worry about. The fact that this symptom is here now, points to the fact that propagation (including validation) is taking too long.

An invisible node is still a full node. Even a pruning invisible node would still be a full node.

Simple math; the way weight is applied to different parts of the transactions, combined with the 4M weight limit, simply guarantees that sum of all transactions without witness data will be less than 1MB.

Agree. But the thing is that it comes down to the same thing, as you already allude to.
If they haven't prepared for 2 separate chains when the fork happens, they will have to shut down the whole exchange until they fix their shit. Of course they won't do that, so they will quickly start losing either Bitcoins or classiccoins because people will deposit only one and withdraw both. That can't last very long either. People will start losing coins and will rightfully blame Coinbase.
It doesn't matter whether Brian steals them personally or his coins trickle away because he can't untangle the coins properly and others take advantage of that.
This is a huge reason why the whole contentious HF is so dangerous (besides all the normal dangers). It simply means that ALL exchanges and ALL merchants need to be prepared to accept both coins (or consciously reject one). But rejecting is not simple because someone will make a transaction with both coins and then demand back their Bitcoins accusing the exchange/merchant of stealing if he doesn't cooperate.
For this reason alone the fast rollout and then 28 days activation time is criminally insane. Also the argument that SPV wallets will be unaffected is a complete lie.
The whole classic charade is banked on mob rule quickly pushing out and shutting up the minority, handwaving away any problems. Simply criminal.

The underlying problem is that apparently in 10% of the cases, Antpool either don't receive or don't fully validate the block completely before finding the next block. Which directly tells you that block propagation and validation need to be become more efficient. Thus dumbly doubling the blocksize is dangerous. 
Exactly as Core has been saying all along.
And again: not because we care that this miner is "wasting" 10% of the blocks. You can argue that the blocks aren't even wasted for all I care.
We care because if a large miner like this isn't equipped well enough to receive and validate blocks quickly, that means that small miners are going to be even worse off. And doubly so because Antpool is likely *very* well equipped to listen in on block hash announcements of competing miners to their workers, which is something small miners can't ever really do.
Both effects mean that big miners have an unfair advantage (head start) over small miners. That means small miners are going to lose out PLUS they stand to lose more orphan races to larger miners. i.e. centralization pressure i.e. even fewer but larger miners in the future.
That's what Core has been warning about and that's the underlying problem this data points to.

Peter Todd already has patches ready that can be used to force miners into proving that they actually downloaded (and hopefully validated) the full parent block completely. That should remove any reason to mine empty blocks.
I'm not sure if the 730kb is another limit Antpool is still using as well (that doesn't make sense anymore anyway) but I know they also mine empty blocks way above normal rate (i.e. validationless mining). OP is actually making a good point that there is still space to be gained without block size limit increase.
Note that validationless mining is a danger to the network as a whole, as well as a centralizing force for mining.

I don't know what level of fee is the correct level. But fees must replace the block coinbase rewards eventually. Relatively soon actually and it makes sense to get some data before the deadline so there is some time to steer and correct a little if necessary. Or maybe it will show this whole thing is never going to work. That's also better to find out sooner than later.
So we need a fee and it's not communism. So we need a market to determine what is the correct price for using block space. A market is where people who want something outbid each other up until what they think is a fair value. That forms an equilibrium.
If blocks are too big that means there's basically an infinite supply of block space. Demand is not stupid so it will pay the absolute minimum (a fraction above zero, basically 0 for all intents and purposes).
Spam will still make the blocks full because it's basically free anyway, so we get all the down sides that large blocks give (high cost for full node and centralisation) without anyone paying for security.
Since we can't distinguish spam from real transactions, we don't even know how much spam there is. We already have that problem today: maybe 1% of current blocks are spam, maybe 80%.
Besides spam there are probably also a lot of low value or less important transactions that may as well be done through LN or at least delayed a few blocks and then batched with other transactions. Or maybe once people see that it's not free they'll finally switch to segwit.
Today we don't know and the only way to know and to get to a stable equilibrium is to not increase the blocksize (ideally even shrink it) and let the market start doing its thing. Only then do we even have some data to say whether we need to grow (and even then it must still be subject to whether such growth is technically possible).
Bitcoin without fee market is not healthy and with a ticking clock towards doom. It was necessarily born that way but it's high time to at least dip our toe in reality and learn what breaks and what needs to be improved. Like the short dip during end of 2017 did.

Ok I'm terribly sorry, you are absolutely right there. Block withholding is already taken for other attacks:   I think I'm mixing that up with the selfish mining attack (although that's a bit different too).
But to be honest, it doesn't really matter that much which attack you're doing (selfish mining or 51% attack or even the block withholding attack to double spend 0 conf).
Also forget about the 1 byte thing, just imagine two parts: the block header and the rest of the block. Hopefully IBLT and/or weak blocks and all that will make "the rest of the block" one TCP packet anyway, so doesn't matter.
What I'm saying is that validationless mining (by others, not even necessarily by the attacker!) will temporarily split the hashing power into 2 distinct partitions each mining on top of different blocks. One partition is validationless mining on top of your block and the other is still mining on the parent. You as an attacker have a large degree of control over how long that "temporary" is, bounded by:
1) I assume validationless miners would have a timeout limit (1 minute? 2 minutes?). Remember in the past they did validationless mining entirely without any time limits!
2) There's a risk that the validating miners find a competing block.
The 2nd one is the dangerous one because then you risk losing your reward. The chance of such a block being found is already pretty small (see further down) and if it does get found and there is a race, then let's say 50-50 chance of winning that race? Then remember that the attacker in my example had 10% hashing power, so even after losing an orphan race, he actually still has a 10% chance of re-gaining the lead by building another block on top of his orphaned block. (Note that this is a mining-centralization pressure by itself: larger miner suffer less from orphans than smaller ones.)
Let's take the extremes:
0% validationless mining: then the attacker just has 10% hashing power, and basically all attack fail.
1% validated mining (excluding attacker himself): the attacker is "helped" by 89% of the hashing power to build the next block. So 1% chance of competing block, 50/50 losing the race and then 10% winning it back. Sounds like an awefully small number. The gain is a fixed 1% increase in reward (for the attacker and every "helping" miner).
[EDIT: hmm.. thinking about it again, I'm not entirely sure about the 1% increase in reward now actually, that would mean those 1% miners would go out of business completely.]
If my math doesn't fail me: 1 in 100 attacks, that 1% finds a competing block, so there's a race. 50/50 makes that 0.5% lost rewards, but 10% chance to regain: 0.45% lost rewards? The upside was already 1%.
[EDIT: Maybe upside is actually 0.55%, getting too late.]
By limiting the block-withholding (sorry) delay to one minute, the above 1 in 100 falls to 1 in 1000, but of course the upside also drops (to 0.1% ?).
I don't know... maybe I should do a sheet and include the whole difficulty adjustment period in there too. I'd be really surprised if the above doesn't work out to be a net gain. If not with those numbers then with a 20% attacker and after the block reward halving.




No, but that's the problem: those miners may actually get rewarded for validationless mining (after a flipping point, maybe not if only 5% do validationless mining), while the honest nodes get to pay for that reward.
You can already see that by purely looking at validationless mining: they do it to earn a bit more by getting a head start. So in the case of never having invalid blocks, they are already earning more at the expensive of validating miners. So that would quickly push more and more miners to do validationless mining untill 100% does it.
That clearly undermines the security because as long as someone creates enough PoW headers to keep the longest chain (which is pretty easy with 100% of miners not validing anything other than the PoW), you can go on forever. So logically there must be some cut off point where validationless miners say: "enough, I want to see real proof now". But then you're in the same situation as we're now: some miners will cut off a little earlier (a bit more "honest") and other later, with the same push towards 100% as late as possible.
I don't know.. any way I look at it, it seems even worse than I though before.
Maybe summarizing, which I think stands even if my math and above described attack are completely wrong:
0% validating honest mining is good.
100% validationless mining is really bad for security, making all kinds of attacks easier because no one is checking while even helping the attacker prolong the (valid or invalid) unvalidated chain.
Anything in between 0% and 100% has 2 problems: pressure towards 100% and the fact that the mining power is temporarily partitioned every 10 minutes between the time the latest header has propagated and the time the block itself has been propagated+validated.
Note that that partitioning alone means that the network as a whole is not running at 100% efficiency: not every single hash counts. Which means a 51% attack by an outsider is a little bit easier.  (This point stands on its own I think, so you might consider adding that as the 2nd argument that convinced you along with the other one a few posts back.)
Again, truly sorry for the confusion about withholding. I'm learning too just by forcing myself to put it down and really think about it in detail.

A fee market is where the price of (fee for) block space is established. Supply (each new block) and demand (each transaction).

Fees MUST be non zero, otherwise Bitcoin can't work at all. Nothing to be pessimistic about.

Better to stop confusing yourself with those terms. Just think in weight only and life is much simpler.
Especially "effectively" is very bad. Blocks these days certainly take "effectively" more than 1MB of my diskspace.
It's not a "base" block either. It's a stripped down backward compatible serialisation of an actual block. The actual block is not "based" on that stripped block.
These words originate with some of the biggest anti bitcoin scammers that specifically picked them for their FUD and confusion factor.
Even the fact that you are intending to get at "the backward compatible version is still accepted by old nodes because it's &lt;1MB" is pretty pointless as who cares how many bytes it is anyway: is about the number of transactions in the block. If we came up with an algorithm to halve the transaction size what's the point of still saying "but base block size is 1MB"?

Just look at how Gavin and followers have been proven wrong at least 5 times over the last year. The proof for that doesn't come from core and isn't technical or difficult to understand.
The actual proof is that they gave up on their project du jour because they themselves discovered data that showed they were wrong.
The latest of that data is from jtoomim saying 2 or 3 MB is currently the absolute max. No need to trust core or me.
That's proof that at least all proposals before classic were dangerous, untested and badly researched.
That means 8GB was wrong (Gavin's original proposal). Unlimited was wrong. 20MB was wrong. 8MB was wrong. 2-4-8 was wrong.
They're treating it as an auction instead of researching facts FCOL!
Anyway, now that SegWit is well underway and the road map is clear and everyone agrees that's a far superior way to actual scaling. Now classic suddenly does a final attack by trying to undercut the due date.
Proven wrong 5x and now for a difference of 250kB you're willing to give them yet another shot? They've been lying to you for a year "trust us, everything will be fine, we can easily scale, let me promise you some unicorns".

You're focusing on empty blocks being a problem for capacity. Not wrong, but it misses the bigger problem.

Good. Analogies always only go so far. But it comes down to that fixing a symptom doesn't usually fix the problem.
Both your points are responses to the symptom. No one really minds the odd empty block, I don't anyway and I'm not complaining about the empty blocks at all. Although as a sidenote I'd say 10% is more than just "the odd".
The underlying problem is that apparently in 10% of the cases, they either don't receive or don't fully validate the block completely before finding the next block. Which directly tells you that block propagation and validation needs to be become more efficient. Thus dumbly doubling the blocksize is dangerous. Exactly as Core has been saying all along.
Your second point is incorrect. Creating PoW for an invalid (or on top of an invalid) block is bad for security as it gives false confirmation(s) to SPV clients which are a false sense of security. If an attacker can count on 10% of the network to build on top of his attacking blocks, it's that much much easier to pull of a successful attack, either against merchants or against the whole network.

That's true, but a fairly flimsy last wall of protection. It's pretty easy for attackers to sybil or MITM attack their victim and make sure they don't talk to honest nodes. Normally that attack was fairly limited because PoW made it expensive, but if the attacker can get the whole network to help him by building blocks on top of his then it's suddenly a lot easier.
Besides: When everyone is wasting their hashing power on an invalid chain, they're not doing their normal job of securing the network. Which means all kinds of other attacks (51% attack) also become that much easier.
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:33:52


Yet dangerous for the network. Bad for security.
Luckily Peter Todd already has patches ready that can be used to force miners into proving that they actually downloaded (and hopefully validated) the full parent block completely. That should remove any reason to mine empty blocks. So it is actually realistic to expect empty blocks to become rare.
That restores the loss of security caused by SPV mining and levels the playing field a tiny bit.

@_date: 2017-04-11 01:16:55
Pff..  talk of wrong and misleading.


/facepalm Yeah so silly, a backwards compatible opt-in update doesn't magically fix old style behaviour. News at 10. You can keep using MS Office 2013, because all bugs were fixed in Office 2017.  But let's make sure to emphasise this important piece of FUD.


Same as above. Plus the vulnerability is still limited to 1MB (backwards compatible), which means it's manageable and mostly a waste of time for the attacker (just like today, and we don't see this attack today, or ever). Can't say the same for any other blocksize increase.


Again a highly ineffective attack, easily recognisable and easy defend against if necessary. Mentioned here purely for FUD purposes.


He said ideally. And that's perfectly correct. You're​ fighting your own strawman. Learn to read first before trying to pretend to be correcting facts.
But don't let that dissuade you from jumping to the next FUD sucked straight from your thumb: where you bend reality and logic of relative prices changing drastically but into perverse FUD where that somehow doesn't help...

Sigh... like I said I don't give a shit what individual the miners do with the blocks, nor am I worried about that. 10% is NOT THE problem, it's a symptom of a deeper underlying problem. The fact that they are doing it is evidence for this deeper problem. It is yet ANOTHER piece of evidence that Core was and is right.
If you can't interpret facts and draw correct conclusions from them, maybe you shouldn't be judging Core as to what they should or shouldn't do.

@_date: 2017-04-11 10:35:07
Is it not worth it to allow up to 5% to not signal SegWit so the 2016 blocks are reached quicker and those miners get a vested interest in not orphaning that chain?
The 5% doesn't even need to be accurate, just hard coded: the first 100 blocks are allowed to be non-SegWit, after that no more.
If jihan really fights this and has majority, that 5% will follow the longer chain, but if it's a close call it might just help.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:33:00

With validationless mining you are helping the attacker to make a longer chain. SPV nodes can be tricked into assuming they are confirmations.
Also: because the invalid chains gets longer it will be harder for the honest miners to catch up and replace the unvalidated block with a valid one.
That alone makes it a lot safer for the attacking miner to do a block withholding attack: 
1) attacker makes a valid block and sends it around except for one byte, so no one can validate it.
2) if a large part of the network will do validationless mining the attacker doesn't have to worry about being orphaned. Especially if another miner builds another empty block on it.
3) the attacker can at will send that last byte and have everyone validate his block + the chain behind it. Remember the block doesn't even need to be invalid for it to be an attack.
What the attacker gained here is that part of the hashing power (the honest part) was wasting their time. So the attacker was able to partition the network on different chains and any hashing power wasted by others means more profit for the attacker (and whoever followed him).

Fucking duh it does. SegWit fixes and alleviates problems blocking any sort of scaling at all. It improves performance and opens the door to many more such improvements.

You people can think this is a kindergarten birthday party where everybody gets to make a wish and gets to decide whether it's cake or cookies for dinner. There's fucking science going on here. There are good and bad options. Almost all bad, some good, we pick the best or none at all. As always in science and engineering.

Indeed. 100% segwit adoption AND good batching AND all small payments moved to LN AND a lasting stable fee market that can handle a growth in supply without crashing to zero fee again AND efficiency boosting features like Schnorr and taproot implemented AND it being technically possible to raise the blocksize without centralisation risk.

Exposed is a big word, but the device will have to be able to sign transactions, so the keys must be in there somewhere. Or i guess it can offload the signing to Trezor like device (yet without human intervention) but that does not add very much to the security.
Anyway, this device ID going to be vulnerable to any OS and related problems. Like the recent one with libc and DNS. Or heart bleed. The good news is that it can be a very very stripped down and dedicated device (maybe like a Raspberry Pi) with the least amount of services installed or open.
The other remaining attack surface would be LN itself. Especially in the beginning people shouldn't trust it with too much money.

You certainly don't operate in "other" tokens. Not really in tokens at all, until settlement. Balances of Bitcoin are continuously updated, represented in ever new versions of real Bitcoin transactions between 2 locked in peers.
Funds go from peer to peer, instantly to the final destination (no confirmations needed).
No double spends because 2 peers have funds locked in, so noone but those 2 nodes can even try to scam them. If they try, they lose ALL their money.
Mycelium would possibly have their own LN nodes, but not necessarily. Anyone can run one and earn small fees.


Yep. And the address in that QR code is still a Bitcoin address, so if either side doesn't support LN, a normal Bitcoin transaction can still be done.
LN is its own decentralized p2p network. Likely even with properties from Tor for anonymization.

First versions of bitcoin had it too, so "contrary to bitcoin" unlikely.
Miners were already free to chose their policy. Some were already doing this anyway.
There are much easier ways to double spend anyway.
Bitcoin is about blockchain and PoW. 0conf transactions don't use blockchain or PoW.
@_date: 2016-02-15 13:43:55


Which is exactly correct. And if you would do that, then you would certainly call it contentious. Now imagine hords of people doing exactly that.
A hard fork by definition creates a new currency. What label humans put (Bitcoin, Bitcoin2 or classic) on it doesn't matter. What is certain is that pre-hard fork is called Bitcoin and nodes that don't change will stay on Bitcoin. New nodes will be dealing with ClassicCoins. The fact that humans try to spread confusion by calling it Bitcoin is irrelevant.
You need to forget that democracy majority crap, it has nothing to do with the situation. And it certainly isn't part of Satoshi-consensus any more than people picking which Linux distribution to run is.

I agree that debate and explanation and re-explanation by devs and other smart people has been useful. I myself needed to convinced by proper arguments at one point.
I am very disappointed however in Gavin either not did not see it or just keep pushing his agenda regardless. Especially when he went all political. I find it amazing (and to their credit) that Core has kept (or increased) pace despite the amount of time having been wasted.
@_date: 2016-02-05 23:25:42
But coming up with innovative sound ideas and implementations like that (actually improving bitcoin and scalability) is too hard, so you just have to push through the last splinter of your ego (coming down from 8GB blocks to 2MB mind you) against the will of anyone with a brain.
"Oh yeah, i love SW, it's great!" But blocks are 70% full so we MUST do an irresponsible hard fork in an even more irresponsible time line one whole month before a real proper safe and uncontentious solution with superior effects has already been scheduled?
Clap clap... What an achievement... 250 kilo bytes one month earlier. And a community and bitcoin shattered and splintered. With new kludgy untested arbitrary limiting factors.
Many core devs have already said to stop working on bitcoin if your ignorant troll army turns out to be the majority. Can we get the same promise from you if it turns out that sanity prevails? Please!
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:54:34
Don't be fooled by what they say they're planning. The first lie is in the first paragraph of their website: "one-feature patch to bitcoin-core", yet they're already dropping Opt-in RBF.
2nd: if Core gets rejected, hardly any of them will ever waste a second of their lifes on helping classic. They'll hopefully continue work on Bitcoin-2.0-done-right. Classic has not even a handful of devs, most of them not even skilled enough to copy-paste something like SegWit, let alone think of something like it or any of the many breakthrough improvements done by Core over the last few years.
Words and promises are worthless, track record is what counts. Gavin has been consistenly wrong by his own admission on the block size (and other things) for the last 1.5 years. The other classics have zero track record at all.
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:13:44


That I hope so too. Sometimes I run into communities/threads that give me hope, but other times I end up on the troll filled parts of the internets and then I lose perspective.


Absolutely. At least we'll have a few years extra where 1MB is plenty, before adoption restores itself :)


I'm not too afraid that a non-contentious hard fork will still be possible. In the end everyone want a higher limit.
In the meantime soft forks and other layers (LN) will take a lot of the load, so we have plenty of time to come to that consensus. And by that time they'll also have far safer methods and more experience for doing hard forks safely.
@_date: 2016-02-07 01:20:02
At the start of this debate the demand was 20GB. Then unlimited. Then 20MB. Then 8. etc. etc.
All of those have quietly disappeared because Core was right all along. They're dangerous. 
Even classic *finally* understands that. Yet their ego and a year+ of wasting everyone's time is too much to actually admit that and be constructive for a change.
Instead they want to undercut a perfect plan that's already well in motion, with a hostile takeover by untested code with rushed deadlines and a mob-rule trigger.
Oh and "wait a year" is a strawman because the plan that's already underway will relieve any pressure 2 months from now.

You'd do well educating yourself on what hard and soft forks are. Hint: "a block was accepted erroneously" (whatever that means) has nothing to do with either.
SegWit is a soft fork, which by definition is backwards compatible (and SW even more so than normal soft forks). So Bitcoin1+SW is by definition still Bitcoin1.

News flash: a decentralized system needs consensus among developers otherwise it's not one system anymore. Yeah that's a different sort of consensus than the most-work valid chain.
Anyway, go argue against what satoshi said. You're taking into the beginners trap of trying to apply redundancy, failover, standby, RAID and other 80ties distributed computing paradigms into a field where they don't apply at all.
If there is a bug it's better if the whole system grinds to a halt until it gets fixed than that random shitty implementations all go off keeping different unreconcilable chains alive.
The product of the system is consensus. One single chain. Did of the chain slowing down is bad but that's still consensus. The system producing multiple alternative universes is fatal failure.

That formula also shows why the weight is not in bytes anymore btw. X and Y are bytes, but Y gets multiplied (without actually taking up 3 times the bytes of course), so the sum can't be in bytes anymore. Either no unit at all, or some people suggest inventing a new unit, like WeightUnit (Wu) which happens to be pronounceable as Wuille, who happened to be one of the big devs behind segwit.

Seriously, what exchange or larger bitcoin holder would NOT do mixing and combining and optimizing transactions to some degree? Do you expect them to hold everything in hot wallets?


In other words, exactly what he said: not owning the keys means you MAY lose access to one side of the fork.


The current longest branch is quite irrelevant in that decision, as the longest chain of monopoly money is still worth nothing. It's about the expectation which chain has the economic majority behind it and which chain has. That is definitely a immeasurable thing and a complex problem to figure out. Probably something only a market could decide on. Not a market run by miners though.
Quite deceitful of you to even bring that up, if you ask me.
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:02:20
In fact it's actually pretty hard for them NOT to steal people's coins, unless they prepare well in advance and they'd definitely announce that in big proud press releases.
Either they have to untangle all coins for their customers and keep separate balances, allowing separate withdrawals etc.
OR they have to keep extreme good track of which coins are still entangled during deposits and which aren't (after multiple confirmations on both chains). Any coin on the wrong chain they'd have to return to the client somehow. But even then they still have to keep separate track of tangled and untangled coins.
Not the sort of fundamental changes to your exchange one would roll out in 20 working days when a HF triggers.

They've also had to make changes to limit the number of signature operations in transactions, since those were N^2 scaling and would have allowed easy DOS attacks.
Those are line changes outside of just test cases.
Note that the way they "fixed" that was pretty retarded: instead of fixing the N^2 to make it N (which Core is working on), they just put some arbitrary limits on it, which will require another hardfork to get rid of again.
Another (reverse) change they did is take out RBF (actually everything in 0.12 as they're basing on the previous version). But they've already promised to take out RBF as well even if rebasing on 0.12. Note that this is a direct lie on their website, which claims one-patch change.

Which is the opposite of consensus, so good luck reaching that in the context of a consensus system.


They are. Everybody is. github.com/bitcoin ... go take it. Oh but that's called open source or free software. Doesn't have anything to do with decentralized (other than it being merely one requirement for it).
You're completely missing the point. Bitcoin is not software. Bitcoin is a set of rules. The rules set out by Satoshi. Rules intended to make the system tend towards consensus. Those rules are set in stone, codified in software. Having different versions of that set of rules, by definition will result in breaking consensus, having different partitions reaching different consensus points. When that's the goal, it's called an altcoin. When that's not the goal, it's just failure. There's nothing in between. There's no benefit to having multiple implementations.

That idea and those tools have existed since almost the day after Bitcoin went life. But they don't work and they can't work. They're also harmful in many ways:

- False sense of security.

The wise recognise this pattern and learn quickly to shut up, stay humble and keep learning.
Then there are those who think they're not only done learning but good enough to start convincing others they know better and are ready to start leading. Zander, Roger Ver, Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn.
All they end up doing is confusing gullible newcomers (or slow learners) with false promises and lies. Instilling them with this false world view of David vs Goliath struggles where they are the good fighting against the evil core conspiracy.

I wonder what you mean by that and if you're not reading it wrong.
Sure an analyst might at some point not have 100% confidence to prove some transactions belonged to some identity. So that means it shouldn't be conclusive evidence to convict someone of murder or whatever. With minimal amount of moving or mixing, at least some level of doubt will always exist. In that sense "taint" might be considered debunked, I guess.
But if you flip around the use of taint, for example a government enforcing a blacklist, they can have very simple broad rules for applying "taint" so that even a 1% "taint" could be enough to get your transaction on that blacklist. Taint certainly isn't debunked in that sense, especially if the blacklist enforcer doesn't care about you losing your value by tainting (in their definition) your coins: the burden is on you to keep your coins untainted. Which of course is an impractical and very risky burden, defeating the whole point of using Bitcoins in the first place.
As for counter measures to get more privacy into Bitcoin: It's not so much that we're trying to defend the murderer, it's more that we simply have to make sure blacklists are simply impossible. Because you know some parties (governments, exchanges, Ethereum-foundations, ...) will at some point want to create a blacklist and a money simply can't have that. Money needs to be fungible.

Then you've been lied to (which happens easily if you listen to the wrong people. 4 months is hardly enough to figure out who's who in the space (where the ones that make the most blouse and claims are all scammers and trolls). Or your definition of "hacky" is off. 
SegWit fixes a huge "mistake" Satoshi made. And it's implemented using methods he himself pioneered: soft fork. He would surely have approved. (Although that's very much irrelevant anyway.) Anyway, go read on SegWit, at least the FAQ and basic info. For example on bitcoincore.org or the initial presentation by Pieter at scalingbitcoin in Hong Kong.


Not sure what"this" refers to. Maybe i should read back for context.
Anyway: break up your idea in big chunks and ask polite questions like "why would X not work?". Google a bit first, as almost all questions have already been asked before (bitcoin.stackexchange.com might be good place to search and ask).
There are plenty of other people around that will gladly explain stuff. As long as you stay humble and don't think you're done learning: noone learned bitcoin in less than two years.

Come on dude. Clearly it's not linear. Just imagine 0 seconds. Then imagine infinite.
When you realise the problems at &lt; 1 second, you should start taking into account the orphan rate and how orphan rates hurt small miners more than large miners, therefore centralisation.
After the point where that effect is negligible, it might be linear for a while. But another important centralisation factor is variability in the payout that miners get, forcing miners into pools. There is a p2p pool solution that keeps things decentralised, but it's not very popular and people are lazy, so easy pools rule.
With all those factors into account it's certainly not linear.
(Haven't read the link, might contain more info. On the other hand it's by Vitalek, so it's probably full of convoluted excuses why ethereum is somehow special and can deal with too low blocktimes.)

1. The point is that miners can generate transactions freely (paying fees to themselves or none at all) and full blocks as far as they want. 
... Ah just saw your edit. :)
Yeah. So one thing is to not look at the fee but at the days destroyed, as a manipulating miner can't create those transactions for free, or would at least run out at some point. But then there's a whole different can of worms plus you have to wonder whether your algorithm is reacting to the correct signal: long time holders will be the people who may decide the blocksize?

Sure. Such work and research was being done for at least 3 years and different potentially achievable hard forks were appearing on the horizon. Until suddenly in december it was discovered that SegWit was possible in a Soft Fork. That accelerated development and opened up a whole host of improvements and potential spin-off benefits on a much shorter time path than anything envisioned before. Thanks to Luke for that key insight.


True, who cares about Eth? I merely mentioned it to show what a mess a hard fork gives. It's good to learn from other's mistakes.
I'm pretty sure in Bitcoin people care about long term stability of the network, the coin and its value, as well as the fact that promises are kept. Nobody is going to put their money in a system where the rules are pulled from underneath it every year.


It actually hasn't. That's one of the lies being spread by rbtc. You can start one of the first versions of Bitcoin today and, apart from needing some help to connect to the P2P network, it will happily download and validate all the way up to today (although very slowly).

It's using Bitcoin smart contracts as intended by Satoshi. It's simply creating Bitcoin transactions just like any other.

That alone would be curing a symptom, not the disease.
Peter Todd is working on suggestions that could be extended to require miners to prove they own the whole block, which would (almost) fix this symptom.

Block size is only a very small part of what scaling is. It's even a very simple and boring part. Technically it's easy as well. (Almost as simple as changing one number, as bcashers and their predecessors used to claim, right before their nodes started crashing left and right because they even fucked that up.)

And is exactly what I've explained to you 3 times now: market cap doesn't mean there's that much value or money in a system.
Thanks for pointing out your own stupidity. Again.


There's no such thing as THE price anyway. But go ask the people that made the chart what "the price" they used to calc the market cap. Cause market cap is "the price" x number of shares (or coins). It's gonna be the last or the mid or bid or some average of one of those over a few hours or days.
I'm gonna take you up on that offer. I made an altcoin and premined a million coins. You buy 1 for $10, so my market cap i a now $ 10M. But that's not enough for me, so i just sold another one to my mom for $100. Can you guess what the market cap is now?
For extra points: go ask the Eth foundation whether the Eth they are sitting on from their IPO scam is included in The Market Cap.


That's what I'm telling you, you dumbfuck! Market cap means jack shit!
Tell that to the people that made this graph (who got it from the exchanges, go tell them).

You're making all kinds of absolutist statements as if proven, but those things are actually very much open questions.

Also, constantly jumping to Satoshi and what you think he must have intended, as the end all be all oracle is very lame. There's no place for religion in science. In /rbtc they also claim to speak the mind of satoshi all the time, we can see where that leads to.

All true. New category. New generation. 
I was simply explaining what i think meant. And agreeing with him.
Also your claim was that hardly ever the first product is the one that wins. But I think a good case can be made that Bitcoin is not just a simple random product like that: is actually a protocol in a space where network effect is hugely important. Similar to how TCP/IP was certainly not the first protocol, but it was the first that was open and relatively simple and good-enough so that enough people started using it until now we're kind of having a problem switching to the next version.
BitTorrent has some similarities too in that it wasn't first but it was the first that filled the decentralised space which was becoming a requirement by then thanks to all the legal pressure from Hollywood etc.
Both were new generation in their respective technologies. Bitcoin fits that description too i think we can agree.
For some protocols network effect is immensely powerful. Clearly IP is so dominant that hardly anyone in the world is even trying to run anything else. Even its successor version has been taking decades and is only now slowly gaining traction (by necessity).
For BitTorrent is less black and white, but there too: more users means more content and higher speeds, which leads to more users.
One could argue over how important network effect is for money. I'd say at least as important as for BitTorrent, but arguments can be made that's is even more important than for IP.
Whether Bitcoin has reached critical mass yet of course is another thing. Or maybe there really is another newer generation just around the corner. One that is even more decentralised and cheaper to operate and without scaling problems.

That's a famous quote from the creator of Bitcoin. People that don't believe in Bitcoin and/or don't understand it will need to learn for themselves. If they don't that's fine too, but there is no point in trying to convince people. Only snake oil salesmen do that.
Bitcoin is an experiment that nobody knows for sure will even work, so trying to convince others to buy in is unethical and a huge warning sign. Helping people educate themselves and then deciding for themselves whether they want some is the honest way.
We used to have many scammers (for example Roger Ver) in the Bitcoin community that would promise golden unicorns to ignorant newcomers just to get them to buy some. Most of those people either lost everything or are now complaining that Bitcoin doesn't work like they were promised and therefore it must change. Luckily they split themselves off into one of the many dead end forks.

Been like that for ~2 years now.
Differences between then and now?
- Bitcoin Core has had immense code and idea improvements vs XT/BU/Unlimited has produced 0 lines of useful code and in fact removed a few important imprtant ones. They haven't even caught up with copy/pasting from Core. Oh and they've forked themselves off of testnet, because... they don't test anything.
- The amount of lies, personal attacks and hiding behind false interpretations of what Satoshi said (by XT/BU/Unlimited) has exploded and become more desparate. At the same time the number of people and miners supporting them has dwindled from a few to practically nobody.
- Popcorn futures have gone through the roof.

Awesome. Very clear.


Yeah. Sounds like that should be clearly a separate (trusted) thing, to keep the distinction clear.
I still do wonder then if it's not harmful if we're standing in the court room and I have proof that my was timestamped to be at 10:00:00 and you claim your file was at 09:30:00 so clearly earlier. But then on further inspection it turns out my block was mined before yours.  I wonder if it would be better to somehow make that more clear in the timestamp you display. Maybe by including a clear error-margin, or by not displaying the actual blocktime but some smoothed increase-only time curve (iff that's actually trustlessly valid).
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:39:37

@_date: 2016-09-23 09:42:30
Not false. There's not a single BIP backed by peer reviewed code, let alone anything remotely resembling consensus. But keep lying to yourself, i don't care.


SW is 2MB, so in combination with the more important changes that SW does and allows, i guess there's your proof that 2MB is not dangerous anymore after all the hard work Core has done in other areas despite the constant harassments and time wasting trolls.


Running and method of update and type of fork are at least as important as the 2MB itself. Luckily Core chose the best, safest and fastest option available. Resulting in consensus among all experts and huge majorities of miners and users. We'll see if the majority is big enough pretty soon.

@_date: 2016-09-15 09:19:23
awesome tool, thank you.
Was wondering how you deal with orphaned blocks, assuming --wait waits for only one confirmation? I understand the PoW still means something on its own, but being part of the winning chain must be better, right?
Also, do the calendars make a chain out of their 1 second interval commits, so that relative ordering is preserved. Possibly solving the orphaned block problem that way: an orphaned timestamp can at least be bounded by a previous and a next timestamp.
I'm also wondering how you handle the time traveling that blocks sometimes do in Bitcoin. As you let your verify command display an absolute datetime, it could get quite confusing if a later timestamp showed an earlier datetime. Do you do any smoothing and make it a strictly increasing time? Or are you actually using the calendar server's time that merely gets confirmed by block-times? Maybe also in combination with a 1-second-interval-chain mentioned above?
I understand that at best all timestamps from one ~10 minute period get into the same block, so technically a calendar server could cheat within that time frame by re-ordering commitments. But assuming no evil calendar (with proof of inconsistency when using multiple and at least one non-evil calendar) it should be possible to get precision roughly to the second, right?
Sorry to be too lazy to look at the code. Looking forward to your next blog on git integration.

@_date: 2017-04-03 01:16:41


You can say what you want. But it doesn't make it true. 2MB scaling is never going to happen before the problems that SegWit fixes are fixed first. And since SegWit is this magic thing that by doing one thing it automatically fixes the 5 other things without any extra effort, plus it increases the block size, then yeah it's SegWit that needs to go first. That's just no brainer logic. You can rename it something else. You can forcefully disable some of the fixes it does, at extra effort, risk and delay, but that doesn't change the facts.
Other than that there's nothing mandatory about SegWit. If you don't want it, fine then we'll just stick to status quo. Perfectly fine by me.
Just know that certain elements don't want SegWit for a very simple reason: they're invested in shitcoins and the more shit and lies and propaganda and dreams flings around in bitcoin circles, the more ignorant sheep will flock to their shitcoin for them too fleece. There is not a single technical objection to SegWit. And there's not a single valid political objection to SegWit other than what comes down to delaying the progress of Bitcoin to squeeze the most out of shitcoin investments. Or for Jihan's political reason: delay SegWit to coordinate it's activation with a new gen of ASICs or try and see if BU gets activated which will hand over all power to him personally.

\&gt; Scaling in my mind is about efficiency, more tx for the same resources.  Increasing the blocksize isn’t scaling, it’s just dumb capacity, more tx  for *more* resources.
Indeed. 
\&gt; more tx  for *more* resources.
Typically not in a 1:1 ratio though. For things that scale really really well, you may possibly double the resources and get near double of the good stuff (linear). Most real world things don't scale that well and take relatively more resources (n log n or n\^2 etc.) than what is gained in output. Bitcoin scales really badly, which again explains why there's basically no point in doubling right now: a small change in capacity has a major effect on cost.
In practice most things also run into bottlenecks and barriers when scaling. So the first few steps may be really good, but at some point it becomes harder and harder. Trying to scale if you haven't identified such barriers is very dangerous for a system like Bitcoin.
The most important work on Bitcoin has been and still is on improving the scalability, which means that when we in the future do increase the block size again, it will have less of a negative effect and won't hit any barriers. A lot of that work has actually already increased capacity already even at current block size.
\&gt; My concern is that BTC is poised to see 1000%+ growth in demand in the  imminent 2-5 years, and that i don’t understand why some increase in  blocksize, however small, isn’t on the table.
I don't know, I tried to play with the numbers and your guess of 1000% a little, but it just quickly becomes too vague. Any number we come up with for any of the factors involved are just rough guesses and the error bars multiply quickly.
Some of my out of my ass guesses:
* I wouldn't be surprised if half of current transactions are spam, people testing, playing around, rearranging their wallets, buying cups of coffee, mining pool payout distribution, exchange deposits and withdrawals. I don't see a problem with pushing most those off or off chain at all, or at least force some batching where sometimes dozens or hundreds of transactions in a few blocks can be combined into one per half hour or whatever.
* Let's go further and move basically all transactions worth a few tens of $ to LN
* Improvements like BECH32, Schnorr and MAST/Taproot will offer small reductions in transaction size. Few percent here, 10 there. And possibly significant numbers once signature aggregation comes into play (signatures are the biggest parts of transactions, so cutting those away helps a lot). 30% reduction in avg tx size in a couple of years and more over the years after that? Part of those reductions are in signature data, which is relatively less heavy in SegWit weight terms, so it will not be a the same % increase in number of transactions. But it will improve scalability, thus making it that much safer to increase the block size in the future (relative to not doing the improvements).
I feel I'm missing some points and I've tried to use conservative numbers (I hope). Either way, we can only know for sure how many current transactions are actually valuable to people once they really need to pay for them. Then we can start to have some better estimations on how much scale we'll actually need.
But even then: if it turns out we "need" a 100, but there are barriers that prevent us from getting there... I think the priority is to go slow and keep the thing alive. I believe Bitcoin is a once in a life time opportunity. The slow silent start it has had is unique and can probably never be repeated again.

\&gt; fee miners are willing to mine
Miners are willing to mine any non-zero fee. They'd mine 1 satoshi.
\&gt; why you didn’t seem to see high fees for real users as motivation to increase on chain capacity.
Not speaking for exab, but that's a false choice. IFF there's technically room to increase the blocksize, only then does it make sense to think about it IFF the fee market is nice and healthy and demand is high enough such that the block size can be increased without resetting the fee market back to zero. Technology and the laws of nature drive this thing, not dreams and wishes.

Not complaining, just said I'm disappointed. And I said I know it was hard.
And I'm complaining about the increase in attack surface caused by all the bullshitcoin support code in the the firmware and the webwallet.
\&gt; No it's not, the attack surface is much smaller than having keys on disk.
First of all, the attack surface of the webwallet adds to the attack surface of the hardware wallet itself, so it's certainly not so clear cut. But also: the attack surface of the keys is only one reason to run a full node. Anonimity is another major one, which is clearly the one I meant by "kind of pointless as long as you're still going through a centralised".

He may mean that one of the two competing blocks may randomly have one or more extra zeros. If you're mining for x leading zeros, the number you find has a 50% chance to have x+1 leading zeros (and 25% of x+2).
I believe those are not counted towards the difficulty though (like you said) as that may incentivize withholding attacks: if you happen to find a block with a few extra zeros you can gamble to withhold it for a while because it will likely win from a competing block.
I'm not sure if the extra zeros do count when comparing the total difficulty of the entire chain. Maybe it effectively doesn't even matter (a would be 51% attacker would have the same distribution of lucky blocks as the real chain).
I'm probably missing some cool details here.

Yes, 8MB doubling at insane rate to 8GB. And then 20MB.
All considerably much higher than even the 4MB that jtoomim determined the max, which already didn't have any safety margin and even his estimate was already too high because it didn't take everything into account. And Gavin wanted to do that BEFORE libpsec256k1, SegWit and many other performance improving and DOS attack averting measures since implemented by Core.
Point is he was lying and completely reckless about having done proper tests, he was ignoring every single expert in the world, pushed through his personal demands without any peer review or consensus, politicizing the issue, claiming divine support from God Satoshi (prophets are the most dangerous kind of people on earth) and drumming up/hiding behind trolls.
His actions would have destroyed Bitcoin by now: vulnerable to n^2 hashing DOS attacks, split up in a hard fork war worse than Ethereum, spammers ("stress-testers") filling blocks like there is no tomorrow and centralized miners happily accepting those.
All facts. Proven by the failures of XT, Unlimited and Classic, which actually managed to BREAK testnet (imagine that on the mainnet): luckily only a few idiots fell for the get-rich-quick promises and they only hurt themselves.
Not once did Gavin admit he may have rushed things a bit or was over optimistic about what the Bitcoin network could handle. Not after failing to find a single bystander for 8GB, 20MB or 8MB. Not after jtoomim's 4MB research.

Yeah LN would likely be that solution. But sidechains could play a nice role too, both in scaling as well as in experimenting with new technologies.
Or possibly creating different sidechains for different parts of the world, to split up the load like that.
My money is on LN though, much much better in all ways. 
Another downside to your vendormachine if it uses Bitcoin directly: it would get double-spent within minutes until it's empty. LN solves that problem too.

Still stupid of you not blaming the people that lied to you and caused you to get in this situation in the first place. Blaming me is not going to help you.

Don't exist.


Classic is definitely an altcoin and therefore by definition not compatible with Bitcoin, so a Bitcoin wallet would never ever be able to accept a classiccoin.
Doesn't explain why you put those 3 into one list. You clearly have no clue what Lignthing is or how it works. Tip: Lightning is like a caching layer for Bitcoin, just like your harddisk has a cache memory inside it, to speed things up and make it more efficient. Doesn't change anything about the bits or bytes or sectors (they don't turn into altcoins), it just improves performance.

Thanks for staying humble, asking honest questions and learning from the answers.
You also might want to read up on Schnorr signatures and Signature Aggregation, which are ideas in the pipeline by, among others, nullc (Gregory Maxwell) which work differently but also save space like you were trying to do.

Yeah cool trick. Also means you can share one channel (or likely a couple) over many vending machines instead of each having their own channel, which then need to be managed (opened, kept in balance, syncing with watchtowers and closed). Saves on a lot of complexity, bandwidth and uptime requirements for the machine. The machine can be completely offline and only be "loaded" with a new batch of "magic words" at the moment it's being restocked with physical goods.
So lot more advantages aside from the safety aspect of not having any private keys in there.

I don't care to say it how it is, when that's needed. I was merely pre-apologising to not you or anyone else, in case I was somehow sidetracking a smarter strategy he was following.


No that's not what got me banned, that's the comment a mod made after misinterpreting my post in the context it was made. Some asshat was accusing people with nasty backward fabrications and taking the fact that they hadn't denied it as proof.
I simply turned that around. Perfectly fine. I could have said anything i wanted there, but i kept it very decent actually.
All those cherry picked quotes ("copy pasted but too lazy to copy the link well" pfff) were perfectly fine in context other than possibly being a waste of time on my part. Or maybe not, as some of those trolls disappeared. 
If you intend to run a forum where "fuck" is a sin, maybe you should hold it in your local church, and warn everyone up front. I have news for you: this is the internet. Or if course you can use it as a excellent excuse to censor. As you did.

I hate people that stand in the way of progress. Which very much includes those that are overselling, overhyping, overpromising and oversimplifying it.

Oh and btw everyone not buying any cola at all will have to pay for that difference in your profit margin as well, you're not allowed to charge only the cola drinkers.

You're the stupid one.
Market cap is price x supply.
What happens when the price of the last 1 coin that was traded was up 10% ? Then the market cap goes up 10%, that's right. Meaning, if you're ignorant, you'll think all coins went up 10% and the whole scamcoin system is somehow 10% more valuable and therefore it's taking away that much from bitcoin. That's in the eyes of dumbasses like you.
Not to mention when the price stays stable but the supply goes up: scammers create 10% more coins? Market cap goes up 10%. Meaning by inflating the supply, scamcoiners can raise the market cap and therefore eat away that much from bitcoin, in the eyes of dumbasses like you.
Normal people of course don't fall for such trickery.

But then you're trusting the devs not to screw up or be black mailed by the NSA or other mafia. Bitcoin is about least trust and being decentralised. An auto-update process is a central point.
Update pace has kept increasing already (more devs, cleaner more modularised code, more experience, versionbits, etc.) and will likely make another jump after segwit is rolled out (as that makes certain changes a lot easier). It also makes for example LN development completely independent and therefore parallel. If you want to count that within the Bitcoin sphere.
As long as there's no need for all nodes in the world to update at once (which you can't force anyway even with an auto-update feature), I'm not too worried about update pace. As long as miners update and a significant portion of other full nodes do too, the rest doesn't matter and will still be fine.
It's also healthy to have a mix of different versions running at the same time, as that will raise alarms as soon as something is not exactly compatible anymore.

High speed relative to Bitcoin like 1 minute blocks, still leaves enough time for a signature. I don't think Liquid is meant for actual high frequency trading.

@_date: 2016-09-11 02:05:05


What makes you say that? Have experience? Have examples from the past?


Then it's not a sound proposal. People are running this system today. If you want to introduce a change, then it better be good to everyone involved, otherwise they don't want it.


That's certainly a speed bump sure, that's why so far all updates have been done through soft forks, which are much safer than hard forks. If your sound proposal is at all possible through a soft fork, then that will likely be your best shot at getting people to agree.


There are reasons for them to be for, but also reasons against. Small miners will think differently than large miners. Miners that think of the long term future of Bitcoin will think differently than those that just want to mine now, sell and don't care so much how long it will last.
And luckily the miners are not the only ones you need to persuade to run your sound update. Miners are actually working for the economic users of Bitcoin (holders and actual senders/receivers). If the miners don't do their job properly, they can get fired (losing all their investments and income).
If you have a sound plan, convincing all those people of that fact shouldn't be that hard. Sure it might take 6 months or a year or more to roll it out, depending on the impact of your sound idea and lots of other stuff. But hey, that's actually quick. Ask Microsoft how long it took to get people to update away from XP.
Now a sound plan does require peer review (who's going to trust a lone guy with a sound idea?) and a BIP and an implementation and extremely good testing and all that, so it's probably best to start by convincing other devs and experts that your idea is indeed sound, otherwise there's little chance of convincing any of the other above mentioned groups.
Good luck drawing up your sound idea.

Yeah you're going way over the top. But few points:
POW forms sort of a bridge between the virtual and physical worlds. Normally a computer program can never be sure about its inputs being real, its outputs having any effect, its internal state or even whether time is passing. For all it knows it may be living in a virtual machine in a simulated environment. It may be stoppped and reset at any moment, even its internal state may be completely fabricated.
POW doesn't fix all of that but it does allow it to get a sense of time and progress. The program now knows effort has been put into making the inputs. Combined with the blockchain and the right consensus code it can produce outputs that are an incentive for outsiders to do the right thing furthering its progress and distribution.
Like a flower attracting bees. The flower doesn't know bees even exist or have any guarantees. It just puts puts up a bounty and hopes some bee like thing comes along to do the right thing.

I guess i was talking mostly about stragglers (people that don't update) slowing down progress in general. Like how Windows XP users to be write a burden for Microsoft to maintain because people never updated.
But I'm not very worried about that. For most soft forks, that doesn't matter. For hard forks it will be a problem as those people will be forked off the network.
That does mean that iff we do a hard fork it will need to be very very uncontentious and a clear improvement for everyone involved (and very well tested and per reviewed and almost proven to be 100%safe). That should give a good incentive for everyone to update in reasonable time.
But looking at that in reverse: those tough requirements are healthy to have in the first place: we want something 100% safe and long term stable etc.

Not your private key, not your bitcoins.
However bad some of those services are (and Coinbase is really \*really\* bad), they're not making it more infeasible for individuals to use a full node (although some have desperately tried to do exactly that).
What influences full node feasibility is the balance between usability and performance (most importantly scaling) improvements by the Bitcoin Core devs on one hand, versus the ever growing size of the blockchain on the other hand. IOW: blockchain shouldn't grow too fast, thus blocks should not be too big.

"Full" and "Listening" don't have anything to do with each other. A Full Node can be Listening or not Listening. A Listening node can be Full or not Full.

You're missing a whole dimension of efficiency gains that LN can make.
A one to one payment channel gains efficiency by working like a cache and aggregating many small payments eventually into one final payment.
That by itself is really only a gain though in certain niche use cases. Which is why it's hardly used today.
Another dimension of efficiency is gained when payment back and forth are netted. One payment going left simply cancels out a payment going right. As long as a channel stays balanced (and only in a somewhat balanced channel), you can move tons of money with only a small amount locked up.
Again, there's pretty much no use case today where that would happen, which is one reason it's not used today.
Now your hub and spoke model hardly takes advantage of the netting opportunity. Only if literally the whole world is connected to your one hub, can you balance the huge circles that money makes from monthly wages to grocery shopping, to 
Only in a well connected network with plenty of channels to choose from, can a smart routing protocol make channels tend towards being balanced and therefore really take advantage of netting.

@_date: 2016-09-17 12:04:34
It may well be that some sort of dynamic limit will be chosen eventually. The problem is: the variables that limit depends on must not be gameable. Block fullness is easily gameable by miners as they can simply fill it with junk (for free!). Also there's an unlimited supply of low fee transactions in the mempool, so even if a miner doesn't make his own junk transactions he can even earn a few cents by including those.
PoW can't be faked and isn't free. Also "Bitcoin Days Destroyed" are at least scarce (i.e. somewhat costly) and can't be faked. 
Not sure, off the top of my head, if there are actually many more unfakeable variables like that. They also need to be fair to all miners equally, not benefit large miners more than smaller miners (centralisation pressure).

Unfortunate, but for the most part it seems coffee shop like merchants. People in the know have been saying for many years that coffee purchases on the blockchain don't make sense at all. Would have been nice if those merchants could have smoothly transitioned to Lightning instead.
But let's not forget that Ver and Jihan delayed SegWit for a year and even before that the whole fake block size debate mostly just wasted time and delayed fruitful work. And even then there wasn't really a problem until Coinbase refused to stop wasting 50% of blockspace prioritizing implementing Ver's scamcoin, while Ver himself launched massive spam attacks.
No block size increase would have helped much against any of that and would only have made Bitcoin much more vulnerable. Imagine 4MB block 2 years ago. That would have been like 500GB block chain today? How many fewer full nodes would there have been then? Would they have been enough to successfully counter the hostile takeover attempt segwit2x (differently named but same shit) ?

Schnorr makes sigs smaller. 


That's silly cause the average transaction airway requires more than one signature. Each input has a signature.
And bitpay itself will be moving coins around as well, probably collecting multiple inputs into one output.


Not only store complex contracts, LN transactions fit example would also benefit a little. Quite likely that bitpay uses multisig somewhere or maybe they should once MAST makes that viable. Either way, other people's transactions will become smaller, reducing the pressure on the block size thus lowering the fees.
SA: again, even normal transactions often have multiple signatures. And SA will incentivized coinjoin which means multiple people will automatically join their reasons into one big transactions *because* that makes it cheaper *because* SA makes the total much much smaller. This again, block size pressure reduced.
Your story about what bitpay does isn't entirely correct but r whatever: in that case they should start working on LN and integrating that into their payment system. LN is the way people will be doing purchases at merchants, not by throwing dust on the blockchain. They have the solution to their failed-since-inception business plan handed to them on fucking platter for free. But instead of accepting it and helping out they are sabotashing the whole system.

Segwit2x is something completely different and already failed hard. Luckily.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:55:21
yes. But more importantly: that healthy situation means that there must always be enough transactions waiting in the mempool and thus that blocks should be full (ignoring miners giving up money by mining empty or half full blocks, that's only their own problem).
That doesn't mean that the limit can't ever grow, for example SegWit did make the limit grow, but in practice that growth is gradual and demand driven, which is good because that means blocks are not suddenly doubled in size emptying all mempools completely, making the fees drop to 0 (like on Bcash, except they're faking a hard coded minimum fee there, which by definition can't work, but that's because their devs have no clue what they're doing).

False. Fees are essential part of the security of bitcoin. A healthy fee market is required. Which requires full blocks and a decent backlog of fee paying transactions. Blocks are far from full and we're hardly using the stretch that SegWit provides. Next steps are reduction in transaction sizes (million times better and smarter than dumb block size increases) and next later tech. We'll see what's possible after that.

The most important choice is to not update. If Core creates a new feature but noone updates, that feature won't get used. If there's a need for it, someone will create a bitcoin version with that feature specifically disabled. So the devs always get competition from earlier versions, forcing them to make newer versions better in all ways.
If you think about it: slow updating also gives stability, which is a very good thing for a currency/investment/system with money at stake. No radical changes.
BTW Currently it's the other way around: people have created alternative versions of bitcoin (xt etc.) But nobody uses those, which sends a strong signal.

Pointless refactorings that make it basically impossible for the one and a half horse head devs to pull in further updates. And no, the 2nd hard fork simply replaced one retarded algo with another obviously flawed one. Upcoming May hard fork is going to be a hilarious shitshow.
But honestly, I don't give a shit about bcash, so I don't even pay attention to the stupidity going on there. But their multiple year trackrecord of blowing up testnets and mainnets and fucking up hard forks and littering production code with untested buggy crap speaks volumes and certainly has not changed one bit. So why would anyone waste their time on proven incapable scammers?


My bitcoind says it's not as it's not connected to a single bcash client and would immediately ban them if they tried.

@_date: 2018-03-05 18:00:59




hmm, thing is: the protocol (security) currently depends on full blocks (because there must be a healthy fee market), so protocol limit block size == _max_ block size. That's probably why I skipped over that detail and assumed we were talking about the same thing.


I think it is, with the slight caveat that SegWit allows for the actual byte size to stretch somewhat (1M vbytes) depending on usage, while the bandwidth of course remains measured in actual bytes. So it indeed will never be 1:1 equal. Over the long term that should approach a somewhat constant factor though, which in the context of scaling doesn't matter.
It would be nice if we could get more user initiated, demand-driven (but capped to security and other practical limits) block size increases, but so far I'm unaware of anyone coming up with a working "flexcap" approach.
Another worry might be that when transaction supply drops dramatically for some reason, then blocks will not be full and fees (i.e. security) will plummet. That's one big reason to not raise the block size willy nilly and again shows the beauty of SegWit in that the incentive to actually use SegWit drops when fees are low, delaying the actual block size increase.

Dude. Not a day ago you were taking about lightning coins. Thanks for learning there.
But instead of either educating yourself further you're here continuing all the other misunderstandings you have about lightning. Doesn't seem like a productive way to learn.
And if learning is not your goal but say objecting to or protesting against lightning, then it's even less effective to throw around ones own ignorance so blatantly.
Again: if you don't like lightning then just don't use it. Lightning as a project indeed is separate from bitcoin, built permissionlessly on top of it, meaning you can't stop it. You don't need to care whether lightning works or not.

@_date: 2018-02-12 10:27:48
Those numbers have been obsoleted a long time ago. Many ways of opening and closing channels more efficiently have been invented. In the meantime blocksize had increased: 1MB is not a thing anymore. And transactions have become more efficient and will become much more so. Not to mention that the LN paper is talking about a future requirement multiple decades away.
Nothing like 60MB idiocy this year.

Is not a question of package vs non-package, it's a question of static or dynamically linked binaries.
If the binaries in the package are not statically linked (which they often aren't because of distro policy) then you run into the exact problems I was talking about.
And yes, an LTS distro can do minor updates OpenSSL package (especially security fixes, the whole point of being LTS, for the openssl package) without other packages even noticing. And boom.. your Bitcoin is forked.

That's because it shows the average. And there are still miners mining (near) empty blocks, dragging the average down. Also, since the spam attack has mostly stopped, there's actually hardly enough transactions around to fill 1MB.
SegWit usage is ~ 5% now, soon it will be larger so that it will show up on the average graphs as well. 
It's actually surprisingly hard to find a good block explorer (one that understands segwit) and shows decent useful graphs.

Mining power follows the money. Users with real transactions with real fees pay that money. Spam doesn't. Fake full nodes don't. Fake devs don't. Jihan doesn't. Ver doesn't. Voorhees doesn't. Scammers like them are only extracting even more money.

@_date: 2017-09-10 05:39:37
The thing about soft forks is that they only restrict existing rules. All bitcoin users have already agreed to the existing rules and soft forks stay within the boundaries of those rules. So in essence everybody has already agreed to them and should have considered all possible soft forks when they did so.
Insofar evil soft forks are conceivable they are attack vectors that need to be blocked. Unfortunately they're likely to be not solvable by software changes (if they are, that would be a soft fork to block the evil potential soft fork), but rather Bitcoin depends on economic or social solutions and processes to prevent evil soft forks from happening.
So what remains are non-evil soft forks. Dev, peer review and discussion processes (must) see to it that the best possible variant gets chosen.

Argue about cause and effect all you will, the symptom and end result are the same (97.5% down). Bitcoin could solve that part of the badness. Whether it will solve or take away the cause and/or prevent a repeat of the misery is a whole different question. Maybe some other misery will just replace it.
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:15:34
Although I've always felt very similar to what is describing, this is a very good point.
@_date: 2016-09-19 11:39:12
Yes, mostly. Although one could argue that the actual separation of signatures from other transaction data makes a lot of sense too so clients have the choice to download only the data or both (double the bandwidth). That's mostly relevant for very old transactions that you don't wish to check the signatures for anyway, but one could also imagine some light client that only downloads the signatures it's interested in itself and skip the rest.
Altering transaction ID is fairly pointless in the sense that you can't directly steal money. Yet one trick people used to do is get a withdrawal from an exchange and then get the malleated transaction in a block. Then they'd email the exchange: "My transaction  didn't go through, please send me my Bitcoins again!". And some exchanges fell for that trick.
Devs had always warned for this. The exchange should have just simply not used the transaction ID to check for confirmations but look at the transaction-outputs being spent or not.
Another thing is that chaining unconfirmed transactions was very unreliable because if a transaction was malleated, all subsequent transactions would become invalid, breaking the chain. Usually mostly an annoyance. Exchanges do a lot of transactions, so instead of waiting 10 minutes between each, they often send out multiple in a row using the change from a previous transaction. (note how RBF solves that even more efficiently, although I know of no exchange yet that utilizes that).
The fact that malleability was possible made that there were a few people running software that would pick up transactions, malleate them before propagating. It's sort of like a DOS attack: No real gain, but attacking/annoying the target anyway.
With SegWit malleability is still possible, but *only* by the signer(s) of the transaction. That solves most cases (all of the above). The only danger is some multi-sig transactions chained together. There one of the signers could malleate to achieve the above goals.

@_date: 2017-09-11 00:20:54
No. That's why the code itself IS the protocol. No matter how meticulous the specification is, it's the running code that matters.
That's because torrents don't have consensus as goal. Torrents succeed if at least one set of nodes combined has the whole file and are willing to share. Quite different from ALL nodes having to be in complete consensus at all times. Go ask what Bram Cohen thinks about multiple implementations of Bitcoin, I'm pretty sure he talked about it already.


Eventually it would be good if bitcoin is completely set in stone and can never change anymore. Then it can really be digital gold.
Until then it's only realistic for a few more changes to happen. That means that old and new versions will temporarily be running side by side. Not alternate implementations but different versions. Also dangerous if there's a consensus bug in one, but far less likely than between random implementations.
The solution is what core has been working on for a long time and is continuing to: libconsensus. One common library for the consensus critical code and alternative implementations can do different p2p or wallet or UI or indexing or any other stuff they like.
It sounds counter intuitive, but consensus is not a layer where standard redundancy solutions help at all. Every alternative by definition only increases the likelihood of consensus failure. All the other layers is a different story.
I'm not ignoring your point, i haven't seen any point. You're just shouting the standard kneejerk RAID/failover/diversity/redundancy mantra without realising there's something special going on here.

They didn't "know" they blocked it themselves. Then BIP148 came around and the miner _knew_ it was going to activate. 


A compromise by definition requires more than one distinct party, not a handful of CEO's behind a closed door.


"unite" also by definition requires multiple distinct parties.


2x didn't have anything to do with activating SW. BIP148 and BIP98 did.
2x was a distraction from the suffered defeat to save face and keep running ASICboost for as long as possible.

It is true for SegWit apart from users needing to keep their software reasonably up to date. They're not forced to use the new feature, it's just wise to run a version that validates the new, more strict, features. But even if they don't they'll be fine. 
It's impossible to change anything about Bitcoin without such effects, the challenge for devs is to do it in the least invasive manner possible, or not do it at all. Either way, Satoshi specifically prepared pathways for such upgrades and called Bitcoin experimental. Demanding it to never change at all is also unreasonable.
Other systemwide impacts of SegWit is lower fees and no more malleability (which was a bug).

The point of a consensus network is consensus. Consensus means all node take the exact same step. Even if it's the wrong step. Worst case all nodes stop stepping completely, at least then there's still consensus.
Any break in consensus is a failure, whether it affects 1% running an alternative implementation or the other 99%, a consensus break damages both sides. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:29:06
Well, probably not on 2x chain, who needs to optimize their procedures and limit their waste if there's plenty of space left and fees are zero anyway?

Classic is bullshit sure.
But what is your problem with lightning?
From the perspective of Bitcoin and the blockchain ALL lightning does is move some bitcoins to some smart contracts (just like ALL other transactions) and then a while later it moves those bitcoins to one or more other smart contracts (just like ALL other transactions do).
By the time Bitcoin has Schnorr and SA and MAST or DEX, it will become pretty much impossible for an outsider to distinguish what transactions are lightning and which are "normal" or other transactions.
That's all you need to know. It's none of your fucking business how people spend their money. But you don't need to care.
All you'll see is transactions and Bitcoin being used.

There's no such thing as "too small", only "too large". "Too small" just means it's a bit cumbersome and expensive. "Too large" means it doesn't work at all. The universe doesn't owe us a "just right". It gives us some random shit and we get to figure out how to make do.
As for "too small" there are still plenty of paths forward: more efficient and smaller transactions, more batching, SegWit, MAST, Schnorr, SA, Coinjoin, compression, MimbleWimble. And if it's still too small then, we'll just have to work harder on higher layer solutions.


How long can you hold that up? Sending a milltion 1TB harddisks around the world every month for 10 years? And after that? We're not building a get-rich-quick-within-10-years pyramid scheme and whoever holds the bag then is screwed. This thing needs to outlast gold.

All irrelevant to an exchange.
He's clearly in a position where he's incentivized to shit on bitcoin to temp pump shitcoins. A million$ in bitcoin doesn't do anything. A million in shitcoin X means 500% profit.
It's also well known that coin launches these days go hand in hand with paying off people in key places to pump for them. Usually in premine tokens. It's been like that at least since the eth premined ico scam.
But tbh i couldn't care less about all that if he wasn't so goddamn retarded on his fake high horse.
2x is certainly a bad thing and actually unlikely to happen at all assist from maybe a token launch to not lose face.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:52:46
Replay protection doesn't change anything about 2x or any other altcoin being completely ignored and doesn't change the security of Bticoin at all. If it would Bitcoin would have been long dead by now.


bcash chain is also longer. Means nothing.


The only thing it means is that there is obvious visible proof that a large amount of evil hashing power exists and if we suspect they might attack the real chain then it might be wise to do a Proof of Work change.


Yes. Absolutely. It's impossible not to.
Anyway, it's not going to happen. 2x hardly has the devs to pull of the launch, let alone maintain it into the future. They have hardly any support from companies. And miner support is already crumbling, although in the end irrelevant anyway.
Maybe we'll get another free dividend from 2x (like from bitcash), or maybe they'll chicken out like all their predecessors (by basically the same devs and same people behind the curtains) did over the years. If it's another dividend situation, you'll just have to be more careful because of the lack of replay protection, but that shouldn't stop anyone from dumping.

100% is turned into heat in the process of doing computational work.
And you don't need to ask Einstein for that. 
The only thing coming out  of your PC right now is heat and some photons from your screen, which turn into heat when they bounce around shit in your room or your eyes. And since your eyes aren't boiling you can guess the energy of these photons compared to the heat coming from your fans is very low.
The only energy that "stays inside" your computer temporarily is some charged capacitors and some mechanical energy in the spinning hard disk. Capacitors are discharged at some point and  the disk eventually stops spinning and thus that energy goes to heat as well (I don't think any harddrive has a regenerative braking system).

Fact: is not about block size just like any "think about the children"laws are about children. Proof: Blocksize was just increased and the biggest whiners are still not taking advantage of it.
Fact: The fork is an attempt to fire core a take control.

You're not listening and you're not understanding pruning.
All full nodes already build a separate index called the UTXO set which contains all unspent transaction outputs. After that blocks are *never* used anymore unless you have data corruption on your disk and have to start over. (And to seed blocks to other nodes of course.) The UTXO set is what is used to look up whether new transactions are valid. 
This makes it perfectly safe to prune old blocks and still have full validation. In fact you're still running a full node.




It doesn't. Somewhere around 0.11 introduced pruning but only with disabled wallet support. But that was fixed in one of the following versions. 


No need to worry: a pruning node is still a full node. Only problem is if everybody would run a pruning node then brand new nodes would not be able to get old blocks anymore.

In the past there has been a problem with OpenSSL getting a minor update that could fork your Bitcoin client (THE OLD ALREADY INSTALLED VERSION) off the network, leaving you vulnerable to attack or confusion causing loss of money.
I'm not saying this was the case in this specific instance, maybe there was something like that going on, maye not, or maybe the maintainer didn't know for sure and took the safe option. Or maybe he just did it to screw you over. I don't care.
Depending on the case, you might now be vulnerable after downgrading to the old version. Although Matt's answer sounds like you should be fine, in this case.
It's not like there any point in not installing the statically linked binary from bitcoin.org anyway. Much safer anyway.

Consensus on block ordering, the rest is locked in rules and open progression. Not closed door decision making and closed source non-development.

@_date: 2017-09-14 12:34:16
Yeah, sure, the more documentation and specifications the better. Just warning that in the end, if there's a bug in the consensus implementation, the blockchain will just keep going no matter what the specification says. The blockchain + Bitcoin P2P network is like a living thing that will not listen tot words on paper, but only to the actual code that it consists of.
And that's also why it's important that the relevant parts of that code (the consensus part) must be exactly 100% the same (which is already impossible with one reference client, let alone with alternative implementation) because any slight incompatibility can break consensus and cause a chain split.
A 100% covering specification written in a language that makes a mathematical proof possible, would be awesome. One tiny further step would then be to compile that specification into executable code and that's perfect.
Without that, we have the reverse: there's executable code that is like a mathematical language and can be translated/interpreted into a human readable language specification as detailed as you like. Unfortunately the only thing that is "provable" (with some assumptions) in there, there's only one way to have your PC and my PC behave identically and stay in consensus is by having them run the exact same code, built from the same source code.

"Whole market down" just means it's even cheaper to manipulate bcash, of which the large majority of coins are not in circulation at all (either his own or in that one miner address or never split from the real Bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:34:56
But the statement of fact (not even opinion) that blocks CAN voluntarily (read: whenever it suits them for whatever reason imaginable) stay small if miners want to is totally not at odds with insisting that miners MUST keep blocks below a certain size.
I really don't see how the two statements can seem contradictory at all.
And it's also the most heard bullshit excuse when you tell a big blocker that big blocks are bad: "oh but big limits doesn't mean miner will really make big blocks"... of course not, scouts honour, it may go just fine so let's assume it will and forget about the rest...


Eh yeah... They always can. Was anybody arguing otherwise? Was anybody arguing that should be forbidden? (hint: that's impossible)
But if one miner (you know... decentralized... means more than one) doesn't play ball in that OPEC you're suggesting (and they ALL have a huge incentive to be that one), then the fee for ALL miners sinks towards zero.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:25:22

I don't know what 1x is supposed to be, I only know of the Bitcoin chain. We're not changing names just because others are misleading people by abusing that name.


If it were to prove that, then it simply proves Satoshi's experiment is over and we can all go home, back to SQL. All of cryptocurrency is over.
But one flaw in your thinking is that you act like it's one single moment in time that miners vote or signal and then that's it for ever after (until the next fork comes up). If all miners go with 2x for 100% then they will lose out huge amounts of money: (12.5 + 3) * $4000 every ten minutes at the very least. And they'll have to share mining profitablity with the other shitfork: bcash (and maybe bgold by that time). They will be back to real Bitcoin within a day, because they _follow_ the money.


Me neither, not about shitcoins and shitforks and scammers like Ver and Jihan anymore.


That's not great either and probably impossible. ASIC proof/resistant is impossible even though it was the scam-du-jour of 2013 and to this day many scamcoins claim to be that.
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:04:46
But that's only in a decentralized situation: you just added a huge incentive for miners to centralize and 51% attack each other.
Still: so you are agreeing that blocks will go towards infinite size if there's no limit: miners won't keep them small. So what else is going to keep the blocks manageable, other than Greg's insistence mentioned above?

@_date: 2017-09-06 16:53:28
No because if they leave transactions in the mempool, another miner will pick it up. Each miner can maximize its income by putting literally as many non-zero-fee transactions in each block as they can.
Miners should want a reasonable block size limit, so then the above isn't applicable: they can only put the highest paying fees in a block until it's full. That will drive the fees up to a market equilibrium.
Miners who don't want this are clearly chasing a nefarious goal: driving up the costs to run a full node so that fewer and fewer people do that anymore. And driving up the costs for other miners, so the other miners go out of business.

I have to tread carefully as I'm not familiar with the actual details in the code here.


Relocated is a big word, but as computers basically don't do much other than moving (relocating) memory around (and calculating numbers), i guess you could say that. I'm sure they've done it as smart as possible as to not unnecessarily copying memory around. But yes, whatever they feed into the hash function either has all witness bytes set to 0 (i think so) or the witness bytes cut away (seems unnecessarily more work to me, but i could be wrong).
I think i remember watching that video back in the day and noticing his mistake as well. He does a nice attempt but certainly gets some things/details wrong (and probably more than i am qualified to recognize). Of course sometimes it makes sense to leave details out or simplify things a bit for the sake of a video. I'm not entirely blaming him. 


Short answer: nothing special is being done to separate witness data or anything like that.
Bit better answer: it's actually an important client side implementation detail. It may store it or prune it completely, or throw away the witness data and keep the rest. It could store it in an SQL database or in morse code on a tape. The thing is: once a transaction has been received and confirmed the output is stored in the UTXO set and then the transaction itself is never ever used again (obvious exceptions: to send to other nodes and to do a rescan).


Correct. Stripping out the witness data is done on the fly while sending the block to such a client. Similar to how Excel can save a file in an old format so that an old Excel version can read it. The old version will not know about the missing advanced features but the most important stuff is there.

@_date: 2017-09-10 05:39:38
The thing about soft forks is that they only restrict existing rules. All bitcoin users have already agreed to the existing rules and soft forks stay within the boundaries of those rules. So in essence everybody has already agreed to them and should have considered all possible soft forks when they did so.
Insofar evil soft forks are conceivable they are attack vectors that need to be blocked. Unfortunately they're likely to be not solvable by software changes (if they are, that would be a soft fork to block the evil potential soft fork), but rather Bitcoin depends on economic or social solutions and processes to prevent evil soft forks from happening.
So what remains are non-evil soft forks. Dev, peer review and discussion processes (must) see to it that the best possible variant gets chosen.

@_date: 2017-09-16 11:29:56
Not sure what Luke was pointing to, but here goes my attempt:
1. Not only make transactions but also (arguably not important) receive transactions (outside and inside blocks) and in the process of receiving verify that they're actually valid.
2. You got the order wrong: they first generate a block with as many (generally: highest fee paying) transactions as they can and then start crunching numbers to find that one special hash which acts like a digital seal statistically proving they did a lot of work. Assuming they didn't make mistakes validating the transactions and filling the block, their block is now valid and they quickly send it around the world to not risk anyone else finding a competing valid block.


Slight correction: it's not about the number of blocks but about the total sum of difficulty of those blocks. Usually that gives the same result, but especially in hostile situations (large re-orgs, 51% attacks, forkcoins) that is an important difference.

No. Consensus rules can be incompatible but not manifest as such until a problem occurs. And that's the whole problem. 
Look at eth alternative implementations for obvious examples. They've never been and still aren't compatible but sometimes they go for months without splitting the chain.
You're still missing the point.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:42:23


There is already choice: you can stay on the old version. And if the new version is really bad you have the choice to do a soft fork to block the new version. And since devs are not that stupid to even try, the threat should be enough. Yes, some dev groups are that stupid (like 2x, XT, Classic, BU etc. etc.) and practice shows nobody will follow them anyway.
Multiple groups of people running different consensus rules in many different directions and many different bugs does NOT help anything and is only dangerous. It's as stupid as BU / EC.

Much more than just block size increase. And those advantages offset the downsides of such a blocksize increase.

Sort of correct. And that definition was dictated by a central authority: Satoshi. That's the set of rules he refers to in the WP and nowhere does he talk about voting for consensus on changes in those rules. There are some posts where he suggests soft forks (and that's a mechanism he specifically built into the code for future upgradability and forward compatibility) and he even mentions the possibility of a hypothetical hard fork once or twice. But nowhere is described the process to actually reach consensus on any of that.
So that leaves us with a few further facts:
Anyone coming up with changes and then claiming that's now Bitcoin is by definition a charlatan. So that's bcash and 2x and all earlier failed attempts like XT and classic and BU.
The current Bitcoin is the only one that still to this day (and at least the foreseeable future) operates within the boundaries of both valid and invalid, as laid out by Satoshi and has overwhelming support.
Only tiny small, progressive and preferably backwards compatible slow changes with overwhelming support and without disrupting existing users, stand a chance of ever being accepted as Bitcoin. If you want radical changes, you can start your own coin with its own dev team and community, you're free to take the open source code, so it's already massively easier than the hard work Satoshi and the rest of the early community had to do.


Yes and no, not really: Yes each node checks according to its own understanding, as that's all it can do. But as soon as they have a different understanding to the extend that consensus is broken, they're not part of the network anymore. So by definition: no. ALL Bitcoin nodes have to be in consensus about what the valid chain is (after sufficient confirmations).


Only consensus on which is the current chain when there is temporary ambiguity and one of the two chaintips needs to be orphaned. Or in other words: only on the order of the transactions. Deja vu?


Nice leap, but no, you just did a faceplant. You're already talking about a different consensus there: the consensus on what is valid and what isn't. That's easy and answered above: Satoshi decided the rules.
The third kind of consensus: the consensus on how to adapt those rules, is yet another thing.


Nah, I know it's bad.


You're lumping the different consensusses together again.


For the transaction ordering consensus, we actually: that's what Bitcoin is forcing miners to do with the punishment of losing money if they don't.
For the rules consensus is pretty easy too, if your shop says you accept Bitcoin, you've just defined what rules you require. Charlatans trying to subvert and poison that name are just that: scammers and counterfeiters. Nothing new there.
For consensus on _changing_ the rules: yeah that hard/impossible to measure. Should that be a reason to just throw your hand in the air and say "whatever, we can't measure it so the first jackass to come around with new rules we'll just accept those, because we can't measure it anyway."? No, that'd be retarded. Looking at it from the opposite side, it's just an extra security: it means changes are extra hard and those suggesting the changes need to do even more work to convince everybody. It's not a democracy where 1 rabbit and 2 wolves vote on what's for dinner.

Don't think coin age is used anymore. Or at least there are miners (probably most) that don't and simply pick the highest fee transactions. The transaction selection method is not part of the consensus protocol, so you can't force anyone to use days destroyed. Unless you want to make that part of the consensus, which is a hard fork.

Sure .15 is deal.
We'll just have to find a commonly agreed escrow person. He splits the coins and sends me clean BTC a few days after the fork or December 31st at the latest (in case of postponement) and he sends you the B2X coins at the same time (if fork happened).
How many coins? 10? 50? 100? 500?

That has been very much a thing for pretty much ever and doubly so in times of a skyrocketing bitcoin price. It's easy to see that that's only a marginal increase in capacity. Much more obvious is that the spam attack suddenly dropped just before SegWit activated as it was becoming clear that they were just wasting their money and not achieving anything.

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:08:12


That's a weird balance for sure, because having the fear of others hijacking progress is exactly the effect that hijackers are seeking. But in the end any (hard fork) update needs overwhelming support, if that's not there for whatever reason, hijackers or not, it's can't happen. And that's a good thing, otherwise we would have a new Bitcoin every week and at the very least that will void the 21M limit (but many more of the fundamental properties of Bitcoin will then be lost).


Being clear about those things might sound nice, but that's simply not how decentralized open source development CAN work even if it wanted to. They're all volunteer individuals without any power other than offering suggestions and convincing arguments for others to help and peer review and test and use.
But yeah, as my personal non-core dev estimation: developing a hard fork will  probably take at least a year and then at least another before it actually gets activated.  (2x in 3 months time is just completely bonkers even for just that reason, let alone all the other stupidity.) But for the near future we have plenty of upgrades and LN to look forward to. And regardless, if something is impossible, there's no amount of wishful thinking and reckless pushing that will make it come true.

Very well put.
Although you can also distinguish between competition on the protocol level as opposed to competition on the application level: different user interfaces or complete applications can still build on top of the same protocol. Happens for IP, BitTorrent and Bitcoin.
Competition on the application level send like a positive healthy thing for the system and its users. There's plenty of opportunities and flexibility while staying compatible with the protocol.
Competition on the protocol level takes the form of an incompatible fork or a whole new protocol. Competition may be "always good" but it might be bad for Bitcoin if it means it's losing network effect.

It's certainly a valid concern and every newcomer filled by scammers like Ver, Voorhees and Jihan is one too many. Code can't really defend against that though. The Bitcoin community needs to fight it. The Bitcoin experiment can indeed fail, despite perfect code, to social and political problems.
The community can certainly do better, but it has successfully fought off many hostile takeover attempts over many years now. November will be the next. Unfortunately it's basically the same people who attempt them every time, apparently the attackers keep getting the benefit of the doubt from too large a portion of the community (although huge parts of that are fake and bought). The community needs to dump the repeat offenders, liars and scammers permanently.

Careful with using names like "base". It's confusing as hell and not how things work at all. Using it to reason about anything leads to the wrong conclusions very quickly. That's why rbtc and 2x love to FUD around with it.
There's only weight with a limit of 4M. Each Signature byte counts as 1 Weight Unit, other bytes count as 4WU each.
MAST reduces script sizes (for non trivial scripts). Each byte saved here counts 4x, but to be fair it's not going to be a huge number of bytes. Although it does mean it will be free for people to start using more complex scripts so maybe there will be use cases and then it's a bit applies to oranges again.
Schnorr reduces signature size, by a decent constant factor for single signature transactions, but al lot more for multisig by reducing it to one signature.
Signature Aggregation eliminates huge numbers of signatures by combining the signatures of all inputs into one, incentivising CoinJoin for even more effect.

You're totally right, yet OP has a point too: the block size increase part of SegWit has proved to be not really needed yet (of course it will be once adoption increases again). The vaccination part of the high fee drama is that everybody has now seen that they must stop being so wasteful and start doing batching, proper fee estimation instead of overpaying 30x and getting ready for SegWit. Those steps make the spam attack much more expensive to reach the same effect in a future attack.

Because the demand for bigger blocks was fake all along, which became obvious a few weeks before SegWit activation when the multiyear spam attack suddenly stopped. Because SW activated only several weeks ago and people obviously take their time to test things before rolling out. Because fees are very low anyway. Because of the FUD that scared some people.
SW is a user driven blocksize increase that can't be gamed by miners or anyone else. People get the size they collectively want and need. It's the only sane blocksize increase and is plenty for the foreseeable future.

No we don't. SegWit was a block size increase.


No they don't. They're the only ones who came up with a solution to increase it, implemented that and that was successfully rolled out.


Only complete lying trolls say that.


Factually false again. (Noticing a pattern yet?)


Makes no sense other than one miner wanting to continue his abuse of his patented monopoly on exploiting a vulnerability in the mining algorithm to gain 30% more hashing power.


That's for sure. And that alone disqualifies it completely.


All you need to do is run an old (pre-fork) version of the bitcoin software. That version will automatically refuse all hard forks. In this case BCH and B2X are clearly the shitforks. Despite their attempts of hijacking the names and confusing people. 


Miners don't decide anything anyway. They follow. They provide a specific service and get paid for that by users. They don't get paid to fuck around on some altcoin.


That's actually quite complex and even a bit dangerous. If you mess up you can lose everything. So the safest thing is to do nothing. If you however want some free money by selling B2X you'll have to take some of those dangerous steps. I'm sure good tutorials will appear when the fork nears, or likely after.
One other way is to go to bitfinex and do the split the and sell BT2 today. Your coins will be stuck on bitfinex however until well after the fork, so you're running the risk of them getting hacked or going bankrupt or whatever.
Stay away from rbtc and bitcoin.com.

The only thing I use from miners is the order of the blocks. Other than that I don't care one bit what they do. (And if they're mining invalid blocks, like an altcoin, then I care even less as they're not even miners to me.)


How come I don't accept Litecoin then? Do those miners no have a natural right to make that the consensus? And how come we're stuck with Trump? Is that the miners consensus too?
Not understanding things is ok. Saying stupid shit in a tone that says you do understand when you clearly dont: that just makes you look stupid (and worse).


Ah. Common rules.
Now who decided those rules again? Who made them common?


I think they signal it to their dead grandma's, but hey, what do I care? It's not part of Bitcoin anyway.


Warn them to not commit suicide. Warn them that we don't need accept their arms up our ass. Warn them that we are the ones paying for a service, whether they provide it or not, but they don't get paid if they don't provide exactly the service that we desire.


Did you ever stop to think about the role of PoW? You really think we give a fuck about a free text field where they put a few characters in? Do you really think that free text field has any bearing whatsoever on the order of the transactions in the block chain? That the mechanism becomes unsuitable depending on what letter are in there?
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:49:03
From skimming the paper, can I roughly ELI5 summarize your idea as follows?
Instead of 1 hash per ~10 minute block, you suggest making space in the blockheaders for 10 hashes, each with a ~1 minute difficulty?
Does each of those hashes come with its own coinbase address so the miners can be truly independent?
What if there are 11 hashes and only 10 spots, who decides which hash is dropped? I guess you'd have to wait for the next block to know?
Does it not mean that all miners must be working on the exact same block (i.e. set of transactions in the same order)?
Sorry, maybe I should just read the paper more thoroughly.

Yeah guess what. Most Core developers actively worked on the only existing and viable block size increase that was possible. And they were successful at it. We got 2+MB blocks now.

"in charge" is not the right description and is not what anybody wants, but i understand what you mean and agree.
Compromises... SegWit already was one but regardless compromises can only be possible between technically equally good options and never ever can be done in a way NYA was: handfull of CEOs that decide something behind closed doors.

Well, I'd say those limits are part of the protocol, otherwise the protocol would grind to a halt pretty quickly. Transactions with way too low fees are not supposed to be flooded through the network. What "too low" means depends on a lot of things and is not strictly defined, but the emergent behavior is that those transactions end up not propagating very well.
But indeed, they are not hard coded limits and it's no problem if some nodes use extremely high settings while others use extremely low settings.


Using extremely low settings does mean that total bandwidth approaches just blocksize every 10 minutes. Meaning, the answer to your question is: they're roughly the same. Which was my point.
Higher settings will cause more transactions to be known before the block is found, meaning you can, if you wish, trade between bandwidth and latency, by paying a bit extra in bandwidth from transactions that don't end up in any block.

And it's nice to see that SW is actually causing a bit of a split there too: there are some that are ok with it out even find it a good idea. Some still think it should be a hard fork instead of a soft fork, but that should be an easy thing to step over once it's time to update.

@_date: 2017-09-11 17:15:23


It might grow, but it's actually limited by the size of data fields they're using (last I heared), so that will require an upgrade to a newer version.


Maybe. Not necessarily.


There is: intermediary nodes are not going to lock up thousands of Bitcoin in  a channel in the off chance that some rich guy wants to move some money. The idea behind LN is velocity, not large amounts. For a large part, velocity can definitely make up for the limits in amounts, especially once the LN network is mature and there is plenty of liquidity flowing back and forth through channels so that intermediary channels simply balance out and "never" settle.
Another natural limiting factor is that it simply makes a lot more sense (and cheaper) to move 1000BTC through the blockchain instead of through LN.
There's some equilibrium where anything smaller is cheaper through LN and above is better on chain. That point will shift upwards as LN matures, but there's definitely some implicit limit. 
Which is just fine. Offloading small transactions leaves plenty of blockspace available for the less frequent large transactions, with still decent fees. And those fees will mentally be as a percentage of the transaction amount, pretty low, they'll just be high enough to discourage people from buying coffees on chain (or spam).

It also ignores ALL of the hard parts of doing a fork. It's like drawing a little rocket ship on a piece of paper to show all the other rocket scientists how you want to go to the moon.
And it certainly ignores knowledge that wasn't available yet back then (although satoshi clearly at least suspected it was going to be hard to scale otherwise he would have made the blocksize dynamic just like the difficulty or otherwise make it soft forkable as he did with practically everything else).
And then it ignores the better solutions that core people have come up with over the years. One was SegWit. More is coming. Up to roughly another doubling.
Anyway that "change a constant is easy" bullcrap has also been debunked many times already by XT and BU completely fucking it up and becoming DDOSed, or outright vulnerable or just randomly crash. Not to mention the quadratic hashing blowing up sync times through the roof.
You'd do wise to go with the times instead of blurting 3 year old disproven newbie points. Shit is more complex than it seems. That's why it wasn't invented in the 60ies like almost everything else in computer science.

What is this obsession with wanting to measure it? We already know that's impossible, that's why bitcoin invented in the first place, but even that strictly only works for a different kind of consensus (i.e. the order of blocks).
However, there's no need to measure it accurately. Do a proper proposal, implement it, get it peer reviewed and tested, make sure enough serious people like it and then just see what happens. If nobody wants it then you didn't have consensus.
All soft forks done so far we done like that and there was no problem with consensus (only with stood or nefarious miners badly signaling).
All failed hard fork attempts didn't follow the above steps at all. They never did proper research or an open discussion or design or peer review or open source development or any testing, nor reasonable timelines. All they did was take some random bikeshed nonsense data point as the spear point of a political campaign, hiding the true motives, and flubbering some code in an afternoon, adding some patches on the places where it exploded the next week. And then the promotion of it consisted purely of shitting on the status quo or any critical thinkers and buying off influential people instead of proving the benefits of the proposal itself (because there were none).
No thucking wonder that none of those got any consensus.

I keep feeling your talking about any altcoin or XT or Classic.  Or bankers saying "blockchain without Bitcoin".
And i would wholly agree.
The thing is: lightning is not an altcoin, it's not even a coin at all.
All it does is form a cache layer over Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is like an extremely slow hard-disk. You can write about 6MB per hour and you also have to wait about an hour before you're sure it was actually written. And every write costs money.
Then lightning adds some RAM memory to that hard-disk. Gigabytes of fast RAM. You can keep overwriting/updating the same file as often as you want. Gigabytes per second.
And you don't have to worry about waiting an hour for confirmation either: every write is guaranteed to be committed to disk eventually.

No of course not. But one of the reasons spv/phone wallets are bad is because they require some trust. Which full nodes don't. One consequence of such trust is that they can't distinguish between chains and will blindly follow one that has more proof of work even if it has invalid blocks. And that's precisely the weakness b2x scammers are trying to abuse.

I think he got it, but was just sidestepping the misunderstanding in OP's "sarcastic" display of ignorance.
We're not heading for a cliff, we've gained a huge amount (and growing) of extra stretch that will help protect against the next spam attack (i.e. make it much more expensive). Most of that stretch is provided by (1) everybody being more efficient by batching transactions and (2) better fee estimation and only 3rd by the blocksize increase that SegWit provides.
Next attack prices will not skyrocket out of control and many more people will still be able to use the network relatively normally. And at the same time everybody will be more incentivized to use SegWit more, so there's a feedback loop to improve the situation even further. LN will soon start to add its weight to this feedback loop as well.
This is what scaling a blockchain means, dumb doubling of the block size is actually counter productive and still leaves the system vulnerable to attack.

Layman explanations are often like that because it visualizes things a bit, but it leads to these misunderstandings, which get milked by trolls.
Wittness data is only segregated in the calculation of the transaction id (which is just a hash). So basically it's calculating a hash where it picks only certain sections of the transactions and leaves the other parts out (it actually masks them to 0, I think, not sure). Like having a piece of paper with text on it and then marking certain paragraphs yellow, other paragraphs blue and then taking a picture. Afterwards the paper is put into a drawer with many other papers and those end up in a (bigger) box and those end up on top of the boxchain.
The paper doesn't get changed or cut up or get segregated. The whole thing is stored and ultimately protected by the hash that's written on top of the box.

@_date: 2017-10-09 01:35:42
You clearly didn't read (or understand) what I wrote, if that's what you think I said.


Not just My node. All nodes.


Oh the magic, all solving, consensus network.




You keep searching for straws in the white paper to clamber onto. It's already clear that Satoshi didn't specifically distinguish between mining and non mining nodes in the white paper. He could have done a better job making that distinction, but back then it was pretty irrelevant and it was certainly irrelevant to the high level overview of the system that he described in the paper. The paper is meant to get an idea across with details on some novel or important parts, but much left to the imagination (or common sense) of the reader.
But you know what. Just to satisfy your itch, I've changed my node from a non-mining node to a mining node. 1 Hash per second.
Problem solved.


resolved -&gt; reach. But whatever: what if I don't give a shit about resolving anything or reaching consensus but instead prefer to wait until others have reached it on their own. I may even pay those others to hurry up a little. Wow, there's an idea!


Yeah, we're getting closer. Just admit that miner don't set the rules but only reach consensus on transaction ordering, leaving everything else to cryptographic proofs and the rest of the P2P network to handle on its own.
That's another way to look at it: except for one little detail, cryptography already protects everything about transactions that needs protecting. The only missing ingredient is double spend protection. One (the simplest?) way to do that is ordering the transactions and cementing that order in the blockchain.


Wildly might be an overstatement, but it's definitely an important detail. If enough people have that misunderstanding it might lead to one of the upcoming forks to succeed and thereby destroy Bitcoin. If I'm wrong that simply means that Bitcoin rules will change every month on the whim of some miners influenced by scammers and politicians. If I'm right then Bitcoin will stop existing if 2x is succesful.
Have you, during the process of learning really Bitcoin (I'm assuming over many months/years) not had those moments where you thought you knew how it works and then suddenly you discover a new perspective or a new fact that shatters that believe and then you jump in to investigate and you find another set of rabbit holes that lead to whole new places?
This is one. Jump already.


Maybe in the initial post. I tend to do that. But fairly sure I haven't in the last 3. Unless you're easily insulted by the foundations of your believes being rocked. In fact I've spend probably at least an hour altogether on all these posts, which nobody will probably ever read. Making this a not very productive use of my time. So whether you jump or not, I think I'll leave it at this. We'll probably meet again if you keep spreading this important misunderstanding.
Just jump already and think for yourself what is the minimum required to make a complete transaction+ledger system work. What part miners perform therein and why they're paid to do it.

@_date: 2017-10-08 23:04:57


They're valid if they can be combined into a block, chained to the previous block, stamped with PoW and then my node says it's valid. My node will check that the transactions themselves and all the signatures are valid, as well as the structure of the block and the timestamp and the PoW and all those details.
Then I know it's A valid order of transactions.
But since I don't like to be double spent, I wait for a while and then if there's still only one valid order, then I start assuming that's the one and only valid order. Absolute 100% certainty is impossible there, but the odds go up really quickly, so usually an hour is enough. Maybe some longer in times of turmoil (around forks or other attacks) or when the transaction is particularly large.


I actually give them a lot of freedom there (within the simple basic validity rules), and I don't really care that much what order they end up choosing. I'm not paying them to come to a specific order. I'm paying them to come to consensus on one specific order.
The validation is actually pretty simple as explained above and the way that validation is done automatically means that it's impossible for a blockchain to contain double spends. And that's actually all that I cared about to begin with. The rest is just baggage to me: the only thing I need is to know that the money I received was not double spent.


Yeah, good idea. And that perfectly says what I said above. Satoshi was just a bit better with words, so he was more concise. But since you didn't get the whitepaper, maybe my alternative wording helped.
Also, if you want to nitpick, I can agree that Satoshi did use a bit confusing terminology there too.


Yeah. But notice that "the acceptance" itself is done before that sentence even comes into play. That sentence describes how those nodes (miners) *express* their acceptance. The decision itself to accept (or to not accept) is not described there. And I know for a fact that my non-mining full node does do exact same decision process. My node expresses the acceptance differently. Non-acceptance is short and quick: ban the node that sent the block and ignore the block. Acceptance is expressed by informing other nodes of this new block and updating my balance on the screen.


of the order of transactions.


Well, obviously a bit dated, but still true (with some assumptions).


by doing the validation of that whole chain from start to finish himself.


Is he talking about the order of the transactions being etched into history there?
So... anyway.. what was the problem again?

Backdoored is a new argument, hadn't heard that before in this context. But if they can backdoor one then they can backdoor multiple and even backfiring just one that has 10% of the users is an extreme blow to bitcoin as a whole and the price. Also splitting up all the review effort over many implementations instead of focusing on making one perfect.
And just to be sure your aware: bitcoin doesn't use openssl anymore. It's libsec256k1 now. Yes still a lib of course. But openssl is not just a security risk it's even more a consensus risk as openssl may decide to do a bugfix that actually causes consensus failure (happened already) and they sometimes do different behaviour on different cpu architectures (also happened if not mistaken).

Old nodes were compiled from the source of yesteryear and yes those had the 1MB limit.
Yes: a SegWit node knows that is taking to an old node and will strip out the witness data right before sending it to that old node. That striped down version is never stored or used though.
It's just like a new version of Excel can save the file in an old version format so an old Excel can open it.


You're right. Unfortunately that's one of the effects trolls have: they abuse and destroy patience.

Then again repeating an rbtc talking point might simply mean you're a relative noob that fell for the nonsense. Bitcoin is complex shit and it's easy to fall for lies deliberately fabricated to confuse newcomers, which is what scammers like Ver and Voorhees and Jihan use rbtc and bitcoincom for.

It's a lot simpler to say miners simply mine whatever pays best. Which has been re-confirmed now that bcash is around. They can switch even between blocks from one chain to the next. You can try to make that all very complicated, but the bottom line is that that's exactly why miners have nothing to say about the rules, they can't be trusted to stick around and do what's best for the chain. Miners follow the money, they don't decide where the money comes from.


Again you're confusing consensuses. Satoshi only used miners for transaction ordering, nothing else.

It's only a risk to Bitcoin users making mistakes (and I agree that's a really bad thing and it's completely on the dishonest scammy devs of 2x that deliberately create that danger, for their own scammy reasons). It's not a risk for Bitcoin itself.


No Bitcoin full node will even see that hash power. At worst it will see slow blocks because Bitcoin hashing power has diminished. SPV nodes might be confused, but they'll surely get a mechanism for the user to choose which chain they want to use (i.e. blacklist one single block) or even better: they start doing more validation (like full nodes) where they do actually check the block size and automatically blacklist bad blocks.
The long known fact is that SPV wallets aren't secure because they trust without validating everything and that's the vulnerability that the 2x scammers are trying to exploit with the lack of replay protection. The effect though will be that 1) more people will start using full nodes, 2) the intermediary light nodes will be developed and used more quickly (already out, forget the name of the project... one of the LN devs I think) and 3) SPV nodes will get slightly better too or can be manually kept in check.
It's almost like 2x devs are doing Bitcoin a service by finally making people understand that they need to run full nodes and making secure alternatives to full nodes viable.


An exchange would actively have to switch their Bitcoin node to accept 2x and then pretend it's Bitcoin. Most exchanges would be sued to death in days for counterfeiting and misrepresenting products. They reallly can't be stupid enough to do that. The standard thing that happens is that they keep running Bitcoin full nodes for Bitcoin and then new 2x nodes and list it as 2x.

No. Hashrate doesn't define the rules or the coin. The rules define who is a miner and who gets ignored.

Worse: More than 2MB is already here. It was blocked for a year by the same liars but it's here. We're already using it. This whole 2MB misnomer is just a stupid distraction.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:03:11


Yes. There are near infinite unconfirmed transactions and I make another billion in 10 minutes if you want me to. That number means nothing and the least of the reasons is that blocks are about weight (used to be MB) and not about number of transactions.


Excellent. I hadn't look at the site when I posted the warning. I usually don't click links when I don't trust something. Your description was unclear on what the site claims to do and especially how it does that. I have since glimpsed the site btw and I'd agree it's not an outright scam. So that's good. I now understand that what you basically do is use a few intimate contacts that you have with some miners to re-send them the transaction in the hopes that they will pick it up. It's very unclear exactly why those miners would do that while they had refused that transaction before. Maybe you pay them (but then why offer this free service), Maybe you're promoting your service and subsidizing the free accelerations with money coming from the paid ones. It doesn't look like you're doing anything like CPFP.
Anyway, I'm not complaining about this service, permissionless innovation afterall. And I do hope it helps a few people in a pickle. 
I do however think, that you're in an unsustainable business model. The whole point of decentralized mining is that miners pick the highest fees and paying one miner on the side can only be more expensive in the long run than just bidding on blockspace where a 100 different miners can take your offer. It would be a bug in Bitcoin incentives if that were not the case (in the vast majority of cases and in the long run; local temporary exceptions are always possible I guess).
Another thing is that users that use RBF won't need your service at all and more and more wallets are likely to be supporting RBF soon. I think Core will in the next release if I'm not mistaken. Similar with CPFP.
Your service may be a nice patch for when things have gone wrong, but the root cause is wallets with bad fee estimation and/or user error. Maybe there will always be some of that. I don't know.
You may also be logging IPs and possibly other information, de-anonymizing transactions. I would certainly advise anyone only use it through Tor.


I'm sorry it came off sounding that way, but that's a side effect of the enormous amount of scams in the space. One can't be too careful and everybody should always "beware". Again: try to make a better 2 sentence description of your service, that should prevent a lot of this doubt.


I may, if I ever make a fee mistake. Although I'll certainly prefer RBF or other decentralized methods.
Maybe I've grown a bit skeptical of services that sort of worked one day just because Bitcoin wasn't perfect and flawless yet, but once those services grow encumbered, they form a negative force against making Bitcoin better, because that threatens the business model. Shit like online wallets, shapeshift, bitpay, anything relying on "free transactions", etc. Those are the forces behind blocking SegWit and smarter contracts and LN.
Good luck with your service.

Yes, it is. WTF? Blocks are larger than 1MB... they grew... bigger... higher size...


That was actually done 2 versions before SegWit came out, so technically SegWit didn't. If you insist on being confusing. But either way that doesn't change anything about the fact that blocks are now bigger... that they grew... that blocks can now be beyond the earlier 1MB limit.


MAXBLOCKSIZE doesn't even exist at all anymore. What more change do you want?
Blocks are fucking bigger. Both in bytes and in number of transactions. And the capacity was increased too. And transactions didn't get smaller.

ASICboost for one.
We were under constant spam attack with at times very high fees for 2 years or so, even then blocks weren't 100% full. So now pointing to some empty blocks does nothing to disprove the bigger picture: there's infinite demand for free perpetual storage. Fees are an obvious pectin against that and voila: that's what we see blocks aren't full thanks to fees. Funny thing is that both chain security as well as a healthy fee market require mempools filled with enough fee paying transactions at all times.

Seems to me: Creating a new wallet (thus HD) gets rid of the backup problem. Importing all old keys into that wallet means you need to create backups once (after the import) and then you should be fine. Not much difference than transfering all coins to new addresses (with all costs and loss of privacy asociated with that).

Those are (consensus rules wise) relatively simple soft forks that will certainly not be left up to the miners again, so I'm not too worried about those.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:38:43
Code is spec is obviously bad normally. But in this case there's simply no choice. The suffrage is running and if a bug streets the blockchain in one direction none of the computers is going to give a fuck what the specs say. Humans may intervene to push the blockchain back in the other direction. Maybe in accordance with the specs. For example if there's a bug that allows more than 21M coins, it's quite likely that such a big would be fixed to what the specs say: 21M. 
But most bugs aren't that black and white. And nor is the statement "code is the spec".
And specs are getting better. But then the only way to be sure that a program actually implements your spec, of that's what you want, is to write a compiler that compiles your spec probably into the source code. But that means your spec is written in a programming language.


Not all of it, only the consensus rules. Other parts can still innovate and grow and optimize just fine.

False. It makes all transactions smaller and allows aggregation, freeing up space which is obviously better than ignorantly pushing for more space. 


Any space saving reduces fees and this helps their use case.


Wow even more wrong, for same reasons.


Your FUD is more than 2 years old now and was already debunked back then. Try harder.

No way. Never ever enter your private key anywhere!
The safe way is to first move all your Bitcoins to new address(es) in an entirely new wallet (new private keys, new seeds, funny further to make new backups!). The BCH will not move, so then you can start experimenting getting your OLD wallet imported somewhere to be able to send the BCH to some exchange.
Price is now 5.7% and on stay decline. I used to think there might be one last push around the time of the upcoming 2x fork, but now tbh I wouldn't be surprised if both end up being practically 0 by that time.
Whether it's worth it to you is your decision. Might be a nice learning experience. Also: you are taking money from scammers, making them pay dearly for their hostile and damaging behaviour. So the profits are actually double sweet.
Edit: note that the above procedure will NOT work for the 2x coins in november. That's going to be much harder and more dangerous.

In as far that the economy isn't circular the circle will be completed by exchanges. And it's not the whole economy that needs to be circular there just need to be plenty circles among the web of channels. There's a huge incentive for circles to fork because that means cutting out exchange fees.
Nona slightly larger blocksize would have been just as easy to spam until high fees. The only thing that can fix high fees is more efficient use, better fee predictions and more predictable fees. Those three are a stable feedback loop where one helps the other and increases the effect of the next. People have been warning for this for years, but of course humans don't listen until it's too late and they actually feel the pain. The spammers gave up and the next spam attack is going to be a lot less effective.
The fact that a lot of people spun up full nodes is really good and almost as good as having those full nodes all the time. But it also shows why its important that IBD be doable and quick.
Nobody's fighting Moore's law. There is a blocksize increase. Any other blocksize increase would have been a hard fork which would never have succeeded in this climate, nor would it have been any faster.

Block size limit is already &gt; 2MB today. Blocks aren't even half full. The loudest whiners (Ver and Jihan) aren't even mining 1MB blocks, let alone 2+MB SegWit blocks. Increasing the block size will not solve anything anyway, while being freakingly dangerous. Core has multiple efficiency gains in the pipeline that will roughly halve the size of transactions, so that's another doubling. Just end the nonsense already.

An attacker only needs to successfully attack one crack. Multiple implementations means many more cracks where there are slight differences in consensus rules or even just P2P behaviour. Any successful attack on any of them causes damage. The only way to minimize that damage is for the whole network to completely shutdown and freeze until the problem is fixed.

Mining requires investments in hardware and access to cheap electricity. Starting an LN node merely requires some bitcoin.

If you want progress faster you're welcome to help. Being too stupid for that is not an excuse to start trolling and sabotaging and threatening the people that do.
Slow SegWit uptake is proof that the whole blocksize argument is just a distraction (as if that hasn't been clear before). There's still a doubling for the taking that is completely user driven. Deve don't need to do anything, users just have to start using it. If they don't that just means they're ok with current fees. If they refuse (like blockchaininfo, Ver and Jihan) it just means they have a hidden agenda.
LN will do fine, is just that nobody knows yet how far it can take us. But it's not an either/or situation, devs are working on another capacity doubling and many other improvements too. As well as on a hard fork that will be acceptable for everybody.

Backdoored is a new argument, hadn't heard that before in this context. But if they can backdoor one then they can backdoor multiple and even backfiring just one that has 10% of the users is an extreme blow to bitcoin as a whole and the price. Also splitting up all the review effort over many implementations instead of focusing on making one perfect.
And just to be sure your aware: bitcoin doesn't use openssl anymore. It's libsec256k1 now. Yes still a lib of course. But openssl is not just a security risk it's even more a consensus risk as openssl may decide to do a bugfix that actually causes consensus failure (happened already) and they sometimes do different behaviour on different cpu architectures (also happened if not mistaken).

9% I haven't checked but yeah that matches the fairly linear uptake over the last few weeks with last time I checked.
No I'm not following you. Although I follow some of the experts around here, so if you happen to respond to them I might read it too.
Blocks are kind of full, but there's still plenty of empty blocks and hypocritically exactly by those miners that have been whining the loudest about block size increases. And double hypocritically: by those miners that don't do SegWit. IOW: what they say and whine about is absolutely exactly the opposite of what we should be doing, because clearly they're not walking their talk.
Also: blocks MUST be full for Bitcoin to actually be secure, or more specifically; the mempool MUST always have a decent backlog of fee paying transactions in order to be able to quickly fill the next several blocks if they happen to come in quick succession. If there are no fee paying transactions in the mempool then minors are incentivized to try to re-do the last block and "steal" the fees from that block.
Fees are not that high; it's obvious that coffee size transactions are simply impossible on a blockchain assuming 7 billion users. Making such a system for only 70 million people is pointless. Promising such a capability now and then in a few years letting a 100million angry people realize they got scammed is, apart from simply a scam, also not very nice. Scammers like Roger Ver and Gavin did (and keep doing) exactly that and that's the cause we're in this mess in the first place.
Saying mempool is 5GB is disingenuous, I can make the mempool 500GB in the next 10 minutes. You can only count reasonable fee paying transactions. Transactions that stand a decent chance of getting into a block within a week or so. Anything else is just spam or freeloaders or coffee transactions or whatever and there's no way to even know which is which.


Let's remind ourselves that blocks are no longer limited to 1MB anymore. But the answer is irrelevant for reasons explained above. The question is wrong too as while you're clearing that mempool, certainly new transactions will be coming in. And if those pay more than what is already waiting in the mempool, the old transactions will not even be considered. That's free market.


It isn't and was never promised to. And you know what's funny: XT, Classic, BU, Bcash ALL don't solve that problem either, yet they DID promise to. (And they create a huge amount of other problems, basically destroying what Bitcoin is in the first place.)


Sure. Not sure it will take as long as the bigblock-fakers managed to stall it (10months?). IOW: it could probably already have been 90% or more usage by now had there not been any sabotaging and hostage taking.


I don't use exchanges, I hodl. Except for dumping Bcash and BT2.

You're confusing alternative implementations (which means different and guaranteed incompatible consensus rules: bad) with alternative clients (I'm not sure how to distinctly name it) built around one single libconsensus library. The latter could be a completely different set of applications, maybe meant for completely different target audiences, maybe different API, different UI, different storage with different indexing and possibly completely incompatible P2P (apart from some bridging functionality somewhere). That would be fine and that would actually provide some more robustness and redundancy. Because that's just like any normal software, as it doesn't handle consensus.
Examples of that sort of already exists, where the P2P layer is augmented with downloading from satellite or from a FIBRE network. I'm sure other hardened or extended API versions exist.
Other than that they can't really exist yet because libconsensus isn't fully ready yet. So they're all based on (or add-on to) full bitcoind/qt for now.
Libconsensus is being worked on (and had been for years) but it's very hard to identify and move all consensus related code, as it turns out many tiny details impact consensus and being a huge refactoring operation, it comes with all the dangers of introducing terrible bugs and it disrupts other development, so they need to take it slow and careful. I'm sure they'd love some help with it if you're interested, but don't expect immediate results.

So does this 2x fork have unimaginable super majority godlike consensus support and backing as is being claimed, or am I seeing a little doubt through the cracks here?


So the value of Bitcoin (the real one) and your fake coins is completely determined by one exchange? Another crack in the panoptic support perhaps?


Hence "futures". Otherwise you could have just done on chain swaps or quick exchange trades+withdraw.


"Fine" is the last word I'd use for pre-failed coup attempt number  But well, I guess free money is always "fine".


So you're promising the world the new Bitcoin Next Generation Improved Super Mega 1.5.1 with full universal  support and omnipotent consensus, but you're actually not sure if it's finished and bug free, or that maybe there might be someone who doesn't like it and sabotages it (that's just a bug in itself by the way)? In fact, you're 50% sure that there is such a bug.


So you're saying 2x can steal 50% of Bitcoin's value? To do what exactly? To what end? Other than scamming all those idiots that fall for it out of their money. So that's 50% of Bitcoin's market cap going into the pockets of a handful of scammers like Ver, Jihan, Voorhees, CSW, etc.. Well scammers have expenses too, so I guess Gavin and Jeff will be loading their pockets and all the echanges collecting fees of course. Yeah, that sounds like a nice heist for sure. Are you standing to gain anything, or are you just one of the suckers?


Yeah that's for sure. So I prefer my early Christmas bonus to still be worth something by the time of the fork. Not the flop 10% that Bcash was.

Still plenty of empty blocks being mined by certain miners.
And every time the spam attack stops, blocks aren't full at all.
But even with full blocks, they're far from 2+MB so whoever is bothered by the full blocks better start using SegWit transactions and demanding companies and miners to do the same (they're mostly nearly organized in NYA group, so you can complain there).
Conclusion: blocks are very far from full and there's no problem other than assholes soaking and assholes using ASICboost or mining bcash.

Why? How so?


Then Bitcoin is worthless. Money that I can't rely on to be able to spend tomorrow is worthless by definition. Then we better stop this whole experiment right now and transact in a different manner. Ferrari against a bunch of cows?




Well if it shows both to us then we can just see it happening. Alarm bells will certainly go off. But in general: yeah that makes Satoshi's solution not a complete Byzantine Generals solution. It only makes such a manipulation extremely expensive and thereby unlikely. Not impossible.




Huh? Where did that come from. You started out with 


The things you talked about in your summary as being problems; basically changing history through 51% attack, don't break consensus rules. They're inevitable and unfortunate loopholes around the system. As such they don't really have anything to do with the consensus rules. They're not easy to self-validate or easy to prove. Except they are to a human, but not to autonomous software and then we're back to getting consensus between humans, something miners are not equipped to assist in. Now humans have to make a choice which version of history to keep and which to throw out. Just like when there's a hard fork: humans have to decide which path to follow.

That article jumps to extreme conclusions based on flimsy assumptions. There's no proof that it was satoshi and in fact the blocks that we do have proof of being Satoshi's (where he pays hall Finney) do NOT match the pattern. Did satoshi deliberately create that pattern and then pick an off block just to create plausible deniability?
Also the block times were often much much longer than 10 minutes around that time, indicating nobody was mining at all and this certainly not satoshi trying to maximize his own block rewards.
He also clearly never have himself the opportunity to premine by putting a news paper header in the genesis block.
In short there is no proof that he did mine that much and there is in fact plausible deniability as well as evidence of him doing his best to be fair.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:28:37


The order of the transactions. Because that's what prevents double-spends. And that's what they're economically incentivized to provide: ordering ("timestamping") of transactions.
There's only one order of valid blocks, any other order is by definition invalid. 


I don't, but even if I did, my Bitcoin node certainly wouldn't accept a litecoin block. Because that lightcoin block is not following the rules. That's the point.
Litecoin miners achieve consensus on the order of the transactions of the the Lightcoin ledger.


The point is: they can't even if they wanted to.Or more accurately: they can signal whatever the fuck they want. Nobody will listen to it or give a fuck.


Yeah, exactly. Nor would anybody have listened and put Hilary in place of Trump if that would have been the signaling. Signaling is meaningless other than coordinating steps on an already agreed upon plan. Or at least that was the idea behind SegWit signaling: SegWit will be rolled out and miners can signal each other and the rest of the community to let them know how far they are with upgrading their software and being ready for it. Then they started holding SegWit hostage thinking the signaling process was us asking them permission or whatever. Then they got smacked in the face when we told them: "fuck you, you start doing SegWit right now, or we're not paying you anymore".


So if I don't want Trump, how do I reject all miners signaling for Trump exactly? How is that going to result in a stable digital money network?


Yeah nice try, but no. Try re-reading the white paper.

I'm not giving you my Ferrari until my node says I got the money. You don't have to *trust* my node, you have to know what rule set my nodes is running under. I say that's the bitcoin.org, Bitcoin Core or in short Bitcoin (assuming obvious scammers don't manage to  muddy that name by claiming their scammy version is called Bitcoin). I can also point you to a recent block and say: that's the chain I'm on, so if you pick a version that builds that chain, we should be good. So again, you don't have to trust my node, you just have to trust me when I say "if you send money to this address on this blockchain defined by the word "Bitcoin" then I'll give you my Ferrari". For all you know I'm lying about even owning a Ferrari. How are your miners going to help you there?


We knew they aren't and they've obviously proven that by hijacking SegWit activation for political and scammy games. But yeah, ideally they are. Independent, such that if one tries to censor a transaction another will include it, making it practically impossible to censor a transaction. (That's the reason for wanting independant decentralized miners, ideally.)


Consensus on what?
Consensus on the presidential election? Clearly their PoW is already useless there.
Consensus on when my birthday is? How are you going to validate that? Maybe I lied to them about it. So PoW doesn't help there either.
Consensus on what the rules of the game by which the miners play? Are you suggesting letting a handful of people decide the rules of their own game? Isn't that called government? Or do you prefer the term "banking system with friends in high places deciding the rules"? And again: how are you going to validate any of that? Who says they are applying the same rules to you as they are to me? Maybe they block donations to wikileaks but not donations to Trump? Stamping PoW onto something is useless by definition if you can't validate that something.


Not sure what that means. They better publish that PoW quickly because it goes worthless very quickly if they don't. But yeah, they do that work, so whatever PoW they produce is their and they can get rewarded for that. After accepting that reward, they don't own it anymore, it's part of the public blockchain. Bitcoin users bought it from them. If they choose not to accept that reward, they did the work for nothing and we'll pay the next miner. We don't care.


They have the right to use their electricity on whatever they like. If they waste it on a Litecoin PoW then it's not a PoW I'm willing to pay for, so as far as I'm concerned they didn't do anything at all (but they're free to do that). If they created a Bitcoin PoW (that is a PoW that is valid under the rules that define Bitcoin) then I'm temporarily interested in paying for that.


Consensus on what? You're using the word consensus as some magical all encompassing thing. Is it world peace consensus? Is it Miss Universe consensus? Is it state lottery consensus? Is it Nuremberg trials consensus? Does it say the earth is flat? Global warming consensus?
That's your whole problem: you're not distinguishing between different kinds of consensus that play a different role on different levels in or around the same system.
The rules of Bitcoin were dictated by Satoshi. Period. You joined this consensus the second you bought a bitcoin and decided to be part of the community. The moment you stop doing that you're out of consensus with Bitcoin. That's fine, but you don't get to participate anymore. You could try to find another consensus somewhere else, but whatever.
Up until now the rules dictated by Satoshi still hold. Only a few extra rules were added to make things a bit stricter. You can choose to turn a blind eye to some of those stricter rules and only use Satoshi's rules. For the most part you'd be fine if you did. You'd run the risk of others turning your transaction down if you explicitly broke one of those stricter rules, but frankly that would be a transaction that Satoshi himself would have frowned upon himself as they would have been impossible to create with his software. But if you're honest in wanting to buys someone's Ferrari I'd assume you make a deal with him where you both agree on the transaction. If not, he'll just not give you the keys and it's your problem.


All three are quite questionable and incomplete statements without proper context.


None of your 3 statements said anything about "rules". How can it suddenly appear in the conclusion?


So now you're saying I don't need to accept their rules. Meaning I can simply ignore their blocks. Meaning I can simply wait for another miner and accept their block instead (or mine myself). Meaning those invalid rules are basically invisible to me. Don't even exist as far as I'm concerned. Okay. Fine by me. I'd shorten that to saying "miner's don't decide the rules", but if you insist going the long way around...


Because all we pay them to do is order the transactions because that's all that a global ledger is: a bunch of transactions (all public; we don't need miners to broadcast those around the world) in a particular order (where dropping any double spends is basically the only important part).
Edit: anyway, I think you're getting closer. Try to let it sink in. This one on one tutorial is not particularly good use of my time. I have happen to have some now, but not much more.

You're the lying one here. Putting words in my mouth again and not reading what I said.
\&gt; 1. Big blocks require fast block transmission.
Even in adversarial conditions.
\&gt; 2. Compact Blocks, Xthin/Xthinner and Graphene provide fast block transmission
CB and FIBRE the fastest and most reliable, the others are garbage.
\&gt; 3. They only work if the mempool is synchronized
They work better the better mempools are synchronised, xthinner falls on its face real quick even with minor differences.
\&gt; 4. Avalanche provides mempool synchronicity
Only in non-adversarial circumstances. boom, game over for your argument. Which is what I've explained 3 times now but you keep ignoring and miscontrueing to benefit your lie. 
\&gt; This is really simple logic. I don't know how you're not able to get this.
Get what exactly? You're quoting out of context (typical of course for a troll), let me include the context:
\&gt; &gt; &gt; You yourself said it’s easy to desynchonize mempools as an attack. Neither Erlay nor Compact blocks prevent this kind of attack.
\&gt; &gt; I never ever said they did.
\&gt; So you didn't make this comment? [
Reading comprehension problem? Where exactly in that comment do I claim "Erlay and/or Compact Blocks prevent desynchonize mempools attack"? You're so pathetically circling your own argument it's like putting christmas lights in your strawman.
\&gt; WTF dude. The burden of proof is on  you because you made the claim Compact Blocks came before Xthin. "Do you  own research on my claims you've just disproven". Pathetic. Literally  my only mistake has been the spelling of a word, meanwhile I've proven  you wrong on almost all of your points. And you call me a liar. The only  explanation I got is cognitive dissonance to the max, so much  projection going on. BTC people have no spine.
One simple google, read nullc's posts. You just have to unhide them because you scumbags censor factual posts over at that cesspool. [
It's not my problem that you keep yourself ignorant and stupid by mingling with idiots that don't want to learn. That's completely your own loss and I can only laugh in your face about that. But as soon as you start trying to infect others, who do want to learn, with your disinformation I'll be there to stop you.
\&gt; I already made lots of Schnorr  transactions with BCH, how about you? Unless you're willing to redefine  the meaning of "being first", BCH absolutely is the first with Schnorr.  So I don't get why you would say BCH isn't the first with Schnorr.
Funny how you again don't mention that that code was built by Core devs, implying your super devs (correction "dev", you only have one, who's incompetent enough on his own and about to walk away btw) built it. And yes it's a completely unfinished version that provides no actual benefits and has not been peer reviewed or fully tested. And it was rammed in by centralized decree. Well done. clap clap. Now fuck off already.

Wtf are you taking about? They were and we have them today. And we could have had them a year ago if not for Ver and other scammers blocking it.
And if you think just changing a constant is enough, core actually did shitloads of other performance was security improvements, all required before any increase was even possible.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:15:21
ok, ignoring the normal counterparty risk of exchanges (which are considerable), I guess you could argue that people are fairly safe. Safe in the sense that they'll get their BTC back, and possibly some shitfork coins eventually. (possible too late to get some money from dumping them.) 
But, I bet there are or at least will be exchanges that will tell forks to go fuck themselves: who's actually paying for the time, effort and risk an exchange has to put into this nonsense? And I also bet there will be some exchanges that will push the shitfork so hard that you will not get your BTC back.
Like for example Coinbase might do right now. Coinbase is probably the most dangerous exchange to have Bitcoin right now. They're actively looking for an excuse to call the shitfork Bitcoin and then send you that instead of the real stuff.

Sounds a bit conservative to help you keep the waiting times to a minimum. I have one of my nodes off for months at a time and then when I turn it on it can take a couple of hours to sync. I know that and don't mind. But if you expect quick startup and immediate use of your wallet, it might be wiser to sync every day.
(I think you work on bitcoin.org as well? Sorry if not.)
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:10:31
Because they must be for bitcoin to be secure. Non full blocks means fees go to zero so miners don't earn anything so bitcoin security goes to shit.
There also always need to be enough free paying transactions in the mempool to fill the next block otherwise miners don't have an incentive to mine the next block and may start attacking the last block to try and grab those fees.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:13:10
I wouldn't mind having my phone wallet do automatic (risk limited) multisig with my home full node (and/or some service provider). Sort of 2factorauth while stealing either private key will not lose me my money. It's just too cumbersome and high fee today.
So maybe in 10 years time when all that had been implemented and smoothed out, the only reason not to use it is lazyness.

Hasnt stopped them so far... In fact the trend has been smaller (Garzik 20% ?) and dumber. Saves money I guess.

Dude... stop coming up with excuses that themselves contain errors. Yes it was. The size limit was taken out completely. 1MB is nowhere to be found in the source code anymore.
And SegWit still has stretch today. If people want bigger blocks all they have to do is start using SegWit transactions more. Apparently people don't find it important enough to do that.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:28:50
Double of 6 is 12, not 9. But whatever, at some point it's comparing apples to oranges anyway, because yesterday's transaction usage patterns are simply different than future ones. One example is CoinJoin where multiple transactions are joined into one with only one aggregate signature. Do you count that as 1 (large) transaction or as 10 or 100, which it would have been today where signature aggregation isn't yet possible?
Comparing tps yesterday to next year is apples to oranges. Comparing bytes yesterday to next year is also apples to oranges.

Dude... that's what you got out of it? You seriously think my specific node of specifically me personally, is the one that defines Bitcoin? Then there's still a problem because at times I have 2 or 3 nodes...
Of course it's not MY node. It's the nodes of the 2 people transacting, and specifically the one receiving the money. But since the receiver would like to spend that money lateron, he better be sure HIS rules are in consensus with Charlie's rules tomorrow when he wants to pay Charlie.
So no, there's not one node that decides the rules. It's all nodes together, but not by voting or coercion or averages or compromises. It's all nodes and those that don't agree fall off the network and are not nodes anymore.
Now see if you can spot the word "miner" anywhere in there.


Only for picking the longest (most total work of work) chain of VALID blocks as defined by the rules above. There's nothing else we need miners for and thus logically we don't let them do anything else, because they're expensive and since we're in a trust-minimized network, we don't want to put any more trust in them than utterly necessary.


I very much do care if you're a bakery and I want some bread and I prefer not to starve.


So you do care?


So you're suggesting selecting a consensus network before the transaction HOPING that they don't decide to change the consensus rules before the transaction actually happens. As signalling doesn't mean anything or guarantees anything or the absence of signalling means anything either, who exactly is fucked if I buy a ferrari from you, but 10 minutes before the transaction takes place the miners decide to change the rules? Yeah that sounds really useful and very decentralized too btw: 3 guys in the world can decide everything.
Maybe you should take a step back and go down a few more rabbit holes. Your understanding of Bitcoin is quite wrong on this level.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:08:40

I don't know how Adam came into this, I haven't seen his points. You're saying crazy shit and are whining that some URL's in the Core source code are being changed away from your bitcoin .org. An honest true Bitcoiner wouldn't whine about that and would fully agree that one centralized domain is a bad thing. The more you whine about it, the deeper you dig your own grave.


I don't think anyone claimed that (yet).


I didn't want to suggest you as corrupted (yet), I meant you seem to be on a path others like Ver and Gavin and Faketoshi and many other bcash or shitcoin scammers took as well. I certainly hope not, but if you think we're gambling a decentralized human revolution on the trustworthiness of one single individual you've already proven the point. Either be a martyr and take the pain in your pride like a man and still make something nice and useful out of bitcoin.org. Or just come out of the closet now as the next Gavin/Ver/Hearn whatever. Anything in between just makes things worse for yourself.


I'll just pretend to not have read that, just to give you the benefit of the doubt. I don't know why, but for some reason I have (and still am) giving you way more benefit of the doubt than I ever gave Ver and Faketoshi and Gavin.

The order of transactions in blocks. Sure miners reach consensus on that. I let them because I don't care about the order that much, as long as all valid and fee paying transactions get in.


Eh ... no.
When you transact with bitcoin, you are agreeing with your counter-party to rely on the consensus, on the order of the transactions included in the ledger, reached by whatever bunch of miners (and none other than those) FOLLOWING the rules that define Bitcoin (i.e. MY Bitcoin node).
I'm very explicitly NOT asking them to come to consensus on what those rules are. I don't give a fuck about what they think those rules need should be. I completely ignore every miner that does NOT follow the rules set by MY Bitcoin client. And there's a shitload of mining power that I continually reject all day long: from litecoin through every other shitcoin to all shitforks like bcash and to-be-b2x.

No, Bitcoin would be worth $100 by now. A coin that lets its course be determined by retarded lying scammers, is utterly worthless.
Also, fees and therefore full blocks are required for Bitcoin to be secure, so negligible fees would be a really bad sign.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:41:42
Wow... You know this hypothetical situation of yours is nonsense, right? It's not going to be a hard split like that. Minimum fees will be all over the place. And then those numbers are completely unknown to anyone. Anything published can't be trusted. Miners come and go. Their electricity and other costs vary. Some have hidden out of band income that distorts everything. Hopefully mining will become more decentralized again with more players and fewer very large ones. Maybe one day miners will need to go anonymous as they were intended to be. One miner can fake to be 2 miners and only use the expensive name when the mempool actually has high paying fees (not just scooped up by previous block) And the whole thing is Gaussian distribution anyway where it regularly takes an hour to find 1 block. That whole little table you drew is unknowable, any logic based on it is bunk.
Maybe you should think a little before posting. You are suggesting a Byzantine consensus problem and you don't have a blockchain to solve it.


No they didn't, they strictly INCREASED their revenue. They do take all the high paying fees too. As do all the 1 satoshi miners.
And you conveniently ignored my point: another undercuts another undercuts another and the one who doesn't goes out of business so all the lower ones actually win.

Yeah, half of all that has nothing to do with scaling. 2 minutes is silly and merely increases orphan rates. Onchain scaling is hopeless anyway on any blockchain.
Does Lightning Network work for Monero yet?


That was actually done pretty well, they took their time to come up with the right solution, but that's only a good thing, especially as there was no reason to rush anyway as has been proven now, all the FUD was fake. And then when the best solution was found it was quickly implemented. Unfortunately a mistake was made rolling it out and allowing the miners and some FUDders to hold it hostage for a while, but in the end that's only a bit of time, time in which many other (including scaling) things were improved and fixed.
I appreciate the difference between Monero and the average (basically all other) shitcoins, as well as the better community and devs compared to other shitcoins (as far as I've seen now). But I'm not convinced it's really enough to replace Bitcoin or offers features that will not be go into Bitcoin when mature.

\&gt; In the general case, if blocks are found at a 10 minute interval, then the average wait time is half of that.
False. It's 10 minutes.
\&gt; all are equally likely, so the average wait time is half of the 10 minute block time.
Why are you only counting from 1 to 10 and not from 1 to 100 minutes? Those happen too.
\&gt; all are equally likely
Also not.
\&gt; It does increase. In the time since the last block, more and more  possible solutions to the next block have been tested and ruled out; the  miners are closer to finding the answer the more time they have already  spent working on solving the block and eliminating possible solutions.
Very false. That would break Bitcoin completely. Mining is not a race. Your chances of rolling a 6 don't increase after rolling the dice a few times.
\&gt; is a series of *independent* events.
So is mining. PoW wouldn't work if it weren't.
\&gt; successive guesses at solving the block
There's no "the block". Every single guess results in a different block.
\&gt; 2nd guess, they know the 1st guess has been ruled out
First or 2nd out of infinite makes no difference. Yes, the combinations are effectively infinite, it's basically 2\^(bitsize of whole header) which is 2\^640.

All of those things are being worked on and/or have been improved a lot already. None have been 100% solved yet. For none however, larger blocks would be a solution whatsoever. None.
At "best" (actually worst) larger blocks can be a temporary relieve for some of those points, causing people to forget about and not fix the actual problem. Then when the problems resurface and they'll be 10x worse.
If your aim is to build something that is good enough for the next 5 years to convince suckers to buy your bags and you don't need to care about afterwards, then yes larger blocks solve all your problems.
I'm talking about a system that actually works, for centuries, till long after I'm dead.
Anyway, you're 4 years too late. Your narrative has already been tested and proven wrong in practice.
You also just said SegWit is a good invention, so there is absolutely zero reason to tie any of your new proposals to SegWit or make it some sort of sacrificial pawn in whatever game you're playing. SegWit is here. It fixed real problems. It open ups pathways to future improvements, including regarding scaling. It directly creates more capacity (larger blocks). There is nothing you can do to undo it.
Also: 0-conf was never a thing and in as far as people did it anyway, they can still do that, even safer than before. ALL transactions are "double-spendable" and always have been. RBF is completely irrelevant to that. Even bringing that nonsense up shows extreme ignorance.
@_date: 2019-09-29 10:00:39
1) Bitcoin did do a blocksize increase. 2) there is no hard cut off problem as blocks must be full for bitcoin to work in the first place. Regardless segwit makes the cutofff less hard.

@_date: 2019-09-19 05:36:56
A hodler does need mining to continue as well. If it doesn't any 51% chain will eventually catch up and take the lead. But even without any such attack: the coins may be "safe" after a few confirmations, but the value of those coins can still go to shits if the network crashes. As I said: it can be argued that hodlers benefit a lot from a healthy and well secured network. 
I'm not arguing they necessarily need to pay for that. If it's impossible to let them pay for it in a decentralized manner (which seems to be the case to me at least) then definitely not. But the benefit is still there regardless.
I'm also not arguing miners can live without hodlers. Haven't thought about that angle much tbh. I will. Hodlers certainly have a big incentive to keep the miners in check and not let them change the rules e.g.

7% is significant, but as blocks are not full and fees are not high there's not much pressure on people rushing their SegWit adoption. I guess we could use another spam attack to help people hurry a little. Or we can just be patient and let people decide for themselves. I don't care either way. As long as SegWit adoption is not near 100% and blocks are not full, that's just proof that we don't need to rush anything. Let alone give in to 2x crooks (but they don't have anything to do with scaling in the first place).

No it's not. Stability and immutability, rock solid rules, predictability, dependabilty are Bitcoin's value. Digital Gold.


Bitcoin will certainly survive that with flying colors. It's still a colossal waste of time and a loss to all newcomers and ignoramas that will get scammed out of their money.

@_date: 2017-10-29 04:18:59


I already addressed:




Only true (probably) for currently existing ASICs. But in general: not true. You can make an ASIC with an extra parameter which covers whatever is being changed. Which is exactly what you'd do if you know PoW is going to change within a year. The ASIC will be a little less efficient because of this extra parameter, but if it survives a PoW change, then it will immediately be the fastest machine in existance after that change.
A PoW change must be completely unpredictable and substantial.


It must be to avoid the bribing situation. But it can't be because if the range of possible changes is predictable, then certain miners get a headstart over others and in the meantime ASIC chips are forced to be much more complex and less efficient increasing the manufacturing costs and overhead costs for miners, which in turn centralizes manufacturing and mining.

Only individual miners have that freedom, not miners as a whole: any one of them can take those fees and oversee his profitability at the expense of others.
That's the whole point of decentralized mining and that's the difference between free market and centralized planning.


Sounds like a nice extra carrot as a reward for centralizing.
Also: no manipulating fees is ready for a miner. He's paying himself anyway.

That's because there wasn't that much need for a blocksize increase to begin with, especially now that the spam had mostly died down. It was all part of the fud campaign from the beginning many years ago. But now we have a usage driven forcible blocksize limit for a while where users get to decide whether they want to save some money or just not bother and pay full fee.
It's a capacity improvement either way. People who are willing to pay double the fee can always waste double the blocksize anyway, just with SegWit the damage they do is reduced.
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:47:58


Why don't you do the opposite? You cherry picked which limits suited your case. Seems pretty obvious that a user doesn't care or even know what is causing a limit, is just a limit. See also adam's reply.
The fact that fooding of the bitcoin blockchain isn't happening too much is because through the years we've fought off silly services like coloured coins and many terribly inefficient proof of existence, messaging and git-on-chain schemes. Fees are the only lasting method to discourage that bullshit, but social pressure and technical limits (max bytes in op-return) can help a bit too.
Despite all that those services still exist wasting space plus the fact that many wallets and companies are still hopelessly inefficient with their transactions and fees, proving that fees are actually too low and that there's no point in doubling the block size if a 5x improvement can still be made elsewhere.
All your points about shitcoins are irrelevant as they're all hardly worth the hassle and don't offer the perpetual storage: most would crumble under even a small percentage of the load that bitcoin sees and shitcoins like eth are already not bothering with full validation anymore.

Opentimestamps does not create a transaction just for your file. It combines many many hashes of many people's files into a Merkle tree and encodes the root hash of that tree into a bitcoin transaction. The ots file will contain the information (like the path through the Merkle tree to your file hash) you need to verify that your hash was committed to by the bitcoin block.
Skipping over many details here, as I don't know them. But  I wouldn't be surprised if some "verbose" setting to the standard verification tools can lay out all the steps (intermediate hashes) involved in the proof in such a way that you could simply verify for yourself that everything checks out.

Adding decimals equal to printing money. Insanely retarded...
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:17:27
Which is why fees need to be high enough to make such attacks expensive and thus demand for block size must be higher than supply, i.e. block size should not increase as long as down attacks are conceivable.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:19:31
Yeah... that's a chicken and egg thing: a hard fork change is impossible to do without overwhelming support, but you can't know in advance whether you have overwhelming support or not. That's because support itself is easily faked and support can't be measured. 
But then again, that's actually a good thing too as it simply makes changes very hard and what we want is a very long term stable and predictable bitcoin: digital gold. We don't want something that changes direction every few years.


If they claim, it's on them to prove it. They can't. The only problem is that people must not fall for their lies and not believe those claims. If they succeed into scaring you to think they're the majority, that's when you've already lost.


There's actually hardly any infighting between the people who either understand the matter at hand or know enough to understand that they don't know the matter, but have a decent sense of who to trust or who's talking complete bullocks. The infighting is primarily among the ignorants, fakers and wannabees. Serious and clashing discussions, sure. Infighting? Not really.


Yeah, those lists are quite nice, even if ultimately they don't mean much. They're a good response to false claims of 2x (and all predecessors) support in clearly displaying opposition. PReferably those (centralized) lists wouldn't be necessary in the first place.

Which is not happening, so moot argument.
Also just a "majority" would be really stupid as that undermines the value, so even a majority wouldn't be dumb enough to push dogshit down people's throats. Overwhelming almost-everybody supermajority is the only way to change the rules. Oh and hashing power doesn't decide anything.

Yes benefit. Yes different.  Deterministic is for creating many Bitcoin wallets, it works great. Some shitcoins also use the same or similar deterministic structure (causing risk of confusion or even fund loss due to user error or key reuse), some use something else (requiring different code hence more attack surface).
Supporting multiple coins means at the very least the code is littered with special cases and small differences for each of the many different execution branches. It also means maintenance and testing becomes a night mare: one small improvement for one coin may introduce a bad bug for another.

So thanks for acknowledging I was right and you and those Avalanche scammers are blatantly lying.

That's already Chrystal clear. If 2x succeeds in any way worthy of the word succeed then Bitcoin and all crypto is dead. Simple as that.
Want to put your money where your mouth is? I'll go all in today.


Absolutely no way in hell. And you can make me prove it by taking up my offer. 


Except 2x is an attack that undermines the value property (for example the 21M limit, but many more) of bitcoin thus reducing its price. You're not maximizing your "profit" at all. Bitcoin is exactly worthless if users don't stick with it and protect it from attacks. Money is worthless if you can't trust to be able to spend it tomorrow. Money controlled by a handful of failed and proven scammer CEO's in a closed hotel room, backed by all of one single invariable dev, is NOT something you can trust to exist tomorrow.

That just proves we don't need bigger blocks. Game over. Thanks for playing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:48
Getting in it to make money is where you went wrong. It never works that way; there is no easy profit otherwise others would have already taken it and they certainly wouldn't be telling you about it. Luckily most real scammers trying to lure people to invest moved to shitcoins, shitforks and ICO's. So that leaves you with historic performance, which is never an indication for future performance.
The only way around this is to understand the tech and believe that it's something special that it will one day be something the world can't function without anymore. Assuming by then the system still uses the same tokens, then yes, they'll have to be worth something. That's a lot of "believe" and assumptions that you have to live with. That's hodling.
Hodling is not holding from 10k to 9k and then still selling.
Also, bonus tip: stop looking at the price. Just go hours, days and later even weeks without looking at it at all. I admit I started looking again around the runup to 20k, but especially in downturns there's just no point.
If you really are worried then it means you've invested more than you can afford to lose and you should sell now. Just keep 0.1 BTC or whatever and if Bitcoin really does get big it will still be more than the average person will ever own.

Even if it only shrinks signatures, that means that space is now free for other data to take its place. Signature of other transactions or 1/4th as much non-signature data of other transactions. Either way: more transactions will fit in the 4M weight limit. The byte size of blocks will go down, even though the transaction count goes up (win-win).

You really need to read more precisely. Luke is the king of pedantic as you call it. Others call it extremely precise in his wording. Not always right. But strawmanning what he says and then calling it bull is not helping anyone.
\&gt; spammers are abusing  block size increase to gain an advantage over legit  users ... this unfair advantage /  bad incentive Segwit has created
So Segwit created an incentive (a way to pay lower fees). For everybody. But spammers are quicker than legit users in taking advantage of that (not so surprisingly).
That's what he said. And he calls that a bad incentive that Segwit has created. And it's unfair because legit users are not able to change their ways as quickly as spammers can.
All are basically facts with the help of hindsight.
\&gt; he was implying that there is some unfair advantage given to somebody
No. He said an advantage was given to everybody but the wrong people are able to take advantage of it quicker than others.
\&gt; Everyone is in the same boat.
Except some are apparently too stuck in their ways to actually start using Segwit. 
\&gt; It doesn't matter what size blocks are
And that's where we go back to fees not paying for block space and thus your wrong conclusion. Block size matters a freaking lot.
\&gt; or how much you pay per byte or vbyte.
Not in absolute terms, but it does in relative to what spammers can get away with paying. It does when it means spammer can outbid legit users.
\&gt; you disadvantage everyone equally.
No. Clearly not. Different use cases are squeezed out before others. Some use cases stop, others start paying higher fees; that's clearly no "equal".
Everybody pays up to whatever they think getting their transaction in is worth. Spammers can only bid so high as they're earning money somewhere else by doing it. They will stop the second it costs 1 cent more. Legit users have other, including non monetary, motives to keep bidding higher.

In fact, 0-confs are deemed holy and bcashtards are constantly attacking core devs "for breaking Bitcoin by making 0-confs unsafe". Which they of course never were in the first place, nor did core devs make it any worse; in fact they only made dealing with 0-confs safer!
So, as usual, it's pretty clear that liars are saying the opposite of actual cold hard facts. In other words, they're clearly targeting newcomers and ignorant idiots. Similar to how Nigerian scam mails select their targets. Utterly disgusting but short term incentive wise it makes sense.

Newcomers should know that bitcoin.org is not the best source for getting bitcoin binaries and that they always need to be careful and verify. Again if you don't agree with that you're merely proving the point. You can't win by arguing for centralisation in a decentralized space, even if you were honest and benevolent.
You pretend not to understand that pumping bcash, which is directly and centrally run by 3 infighting and outright proven scammers, is a dumb idea. The bcash that is on all counts much worse than even the recently exit-scammed litecoin scam. For your fake concerns you literally pump the worst possible solution.
Yes those concerns are fake. Fees are supposed to go up, that's the point of them. The extreme runaway effect we saw last year will not repeat as everybody has finally woken up to this fact and got their batching, fee estimation and segwit acts together. Further improving every day. Together with LN there's now way more stretch available.
And if you think scaling works by sending btc to a centralised exchange to buy a totally insecure scamcoin that only drops in value, frankly you're just insane. That doesn't even save on btc transactions and is in all imaginable ways worse than simply locking up that same btc in a timelock multisig and using LN.

Your wording of getting rewarded for broadcasting is actually better than the commenter thinks. We want to reward miners for validating and the pow, but if they don't broadcast, they won't get it.

All true. Sort of.
One of my thoughts initially coming into Bitcoin was that it's kind of "unfair" that those transacting are paying all the costs, while those who arguably benefit the most from the security (long time hodlers) basically don't pay anything. Of course "fair" is not an argument at all, we only get to chose from what the universe offers us.
One problem with a tail emission is that it's another arbitrary value that someone (Satoshi) would have to have set. One more thing he would have had to research like mad and predict 100 years into the future. One more thing people could get political battles over (small tailers vs big tailers).
What value to set it to?  There's no way to make it dynamic and decentralized. Can't give miners power over that. A constant number of BTC then? That still means inflation goes to 0% in the long run, so basically no difference. A fixed % then? A % of the still existing number of Bitcoins would be an economic %inflation, but that's an impossible to know number. So a % of the total created BTC then? How big a % then?
And even with a tail emission, fees are still absolutely necessary as a decentralized anti-spam measure, yet a tail emission only undermines a healthy fee market.
Come to think of it, I even think a tail emission would merely be an added cost on top of fees, without actually lowering the fees (supply/demand unrelated to emission). It would merely add to the total energy burned by mining, but it wouldn't even really add to security either when everybody just has x% more mining going on (remember an attacker will also be paid that tail emission reward).

Cause the owner of that domain is acting more and more crazy and unreliable. That's inherent to a decentralized system: can't have one official website. And unfortunately human greed and corruption seem to take hold of many. Star Wars would be even more boring without a dark side i guess.
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:32:43
\&gt; But all coins with a tail emission have a fee system as well, those are not mutually exclusive.
Except they don't really. Not anything decentralized anyway. They may have some centrally set fee or some default that's so low that nobody is bothering thinking about it. But no shitcoin has an actual fee market where purely supply and demand determine the level with no human intervention. Even Bitcoin doesn't really have that, yet. (It's close, but still distorted by the relatively large coin creation, and the experiment on whether it can become long-term stable is still out.)
But yeah, like I said in my earlier post, they're not mutually exclusive, but I do think anti-spam fees are absolutely necessary, while inflation (at this layer) is purely an added cost with no benefit (plus mentioned problems).
\&gt; Every constant Satoshi made was based on assumptions that may or may not  be optimal. But to introduce human governance would also open the  system to abuse. There is simply no perfect system.
Having the rock solid 0-inflation Bitcoin layer, makes it "easy" and "safe" to build any kind of monetary system on top of that with any kind of inflation policy people may like. The reverse would be impossible.
Also I'd argue that all the constants that Satoshi did have to put in, are actually in the ball park of perfect, small changes would be inconsequential. Things like the 10 minutes average block time and 2016 blocks re-targeting period. Halving or doubling those values is basically inconsequential. Of course setting them to extremes would be disastrous.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:08:48
Even better: at creation time. The full unpruned script never needs to leave the computer(s) of the person/people involved in creating the transaction.
(2-of-2 multisig) OR (1sig+timelock)
You can make a transaction with only the 2-of-2 multisig part in it. Nobody will know what the other part of the script was.

Nobody can. Bitcoin doesn't have an auto-update feature, on purpose. The only thing people can do is create a version and ask people to run it. Now obviously it would be a bit chaotic if everybody and his dog were to make different versions. So for such practical reasons a bunch of devs have decided to work together and converge all the work they do in their personal git repos into one combined repo, double and triple checking eachother on the way. Since this process can impossibly be automated (otherwise it would be called an automatic-update process where any random stranger can put in unchecked changes) there are a few people along the way that check the git commits and merge them. Then everybody else double checks the results of that again. Those people do a hell of a job and are very important, but it's not a special role in the sense that they can change anything or can block changes from going in. If they misbehave in such a way, they're easily replaced. In the end it's hundreds of devs and researchers and many more further out as well as ultimately you yourself who decide which version to download and run. If anyone along that pyramid of people spots something wrong and sounds the alarm, you'd probably not download that version.


Bit of a contradiction, but I guess I know what you mean. Then again: can it be anything different than that? They have to be developers, and pretty damn good ones too, otherwise the thing would just be a buggy mess (like Bcash or 2x). And even only good developers is not enough, at least some of them need to be experts in fields like P2P networks, game theory, cryptography, economics and many other fields. Thinking about those requirements, it's quite obvious why I'm not one of them and at the same time it's amazing how quickly their numbers are growing. There are many much less demanding open source projects that go for decades with basically a handful of devs.
And if you still want to insist on calling ~100 mostly unrelated independent devs centralized, then I guess you could argue it would be nice to have yet another ~100 similarly capable group as an alternative. But then the question is: do you want competing implementations or do you want the best of both groups combined into one version? But then that's the same as one group of ~200. (Alternative implementations are a whole different can of worms and actually counter intuitively basically between counter productive, dangerous and impossible.)


I don't think there's much of a mess to begin with tbh. Not anything related to the devs or their processes. It's all politics and scammery on levels that have nothing to do with devs (apart from them being the victims being blamed and having to waste time to debunk lies about them). I'm not sure if Satoshi being here would be better or not. He sure as hell would have to have the kind of character that can accept things from people smarter than him and admitting to some mistakes. (I have no reason to doubt that, in fact he has proven he's that kind of character, just saying.) Maybe Satoshi could have been able to put the hammer down every now and then and call out people trying to sabotage or pull of scams in the name of Bitcoin or Satoshi. That should shut up Ver for example and make a whole class of problems go away. In the end though, those scammers will find other ways and start pooping on Satoshi to discredit him and push their own scams.


Absolutely not. I've seen at least 5 of these attempts now. They're all by the same people. They've been wrong every time. They've utterly failed to even bring a decent bug free product to the table, let alone anything anybody wants to back. They keep coming back with the same garbage wrapped with an even more implausible get-rich-quick promise for their sheep followers. Bitcoin only became stronger with every failed attempt.

Oh and all those companies are owned by or recently invested in by Bitmain.

Assuming you have some economic value or activity in Bitcoin.


Yes, I know someone who would give a fuck. I know someone who would be really pissed off if his transaction went wrong because he shut down his full node and went to trust someone else who turned out to fuck him over.
That's what changes. And there are (or will be) millions/billions of people exactly like that. And all those people combined ARE Bitcoin.
Some of those people may have a double role and happen to mine on the side, but that's totally irrelevant. They simply get paid to do a simple job. Or not, if they don't.


Miners create consensus on the order of transactions, as to prevent double spending. That's all they're required to do. That's all they're paid to do. That's all we allow them to do. Other than that, they can go fuck themselves.

XT, Classic, Unlimited, EC, BCash, .... I know I missed one, but are we really up to 8 already?

Yeah, my intuition told me it wasn't as simple as dividing the time by 10, but I couldn't put my finger on it (my intuition isn't that smart, so I kept it in for ELI5 sake).
So the miner doing the final hash gathers the other 9 and uses those as a sort of discount coupons. But that means that the first 9 hashes only hash a coinbase transaction and the prev-block hash, not an entire block. So those miners don't even need to run a full node or a mempool at all?
And whoever receives 9 simple hashes first can then start trying for the 10th? 
Sounds like you're splitting miners into two classes. And those miners well enough connected to the network and capable enough can jump from one class to the other whenever the opportunity presents itself.
To my layman's ear, that sounds like a huge hornest nest of adversarial game theoretic withholding and latency sensitive race games that miners can play on eachother.
Anyway, thanks for answering. I'll go read it more thoroughly before jumping to more dumb assumptions.

Planning and discussing is happening. Even BIPs are getting created. But as long as the atmosphere is this toxic there's no reason to even try to get agreement (with users). All devs can do is plan and prepare the best and most complete possible hard fork and purpose it when it's ready. But we can't expect them to waste manyears of work on something that will certainly get hijacked and abused by Ver and co.
But then again, as long as it's contentious that just means it's not needed hard enough, so too bad. Once it's not contentious anymore things can go fairly quickly. At least the lockin can be done relatively quickly, activation might then be like a year later or so.

Not zero.
People had many chances to make their claims, and as things look currently people will get 100% of USD or JPY holdings back eventually and a percentage (like 10% or so) of their BTC holdings. It will probably take a long time still (if new bad things don't happen like Japanese tax office claiming a large % or keys being mismanaged or stolen again) but it looks "ok" so far. There's also a company making offers to buy the BTC claim for around 30% of that 10% mentioned above.
It may still be possible today to make a new claim.

All while the price went 20x.

Bitcoin still have more than 95% of the market share. Maybe you're confused about how market caps work too? You also seem confused by false promises, impossible targets, golden unicorns and get rich quick marketing hype without dev of science team backing any of it.


Yeah that charts again... I've already debunked tomtomtom throwing this horse shit around many times. Hint: you can't read LIMITS from an AVERAGE chart, especially when different miners didn't all have the exact same limit and those limits were not always hit for other reasons (like validationless mining and ASICboost).
Look up the version of that chart that shows the MAX block sizes, not the averages and see how the limits smack you in the face.
Add to that that Bitcoin fees were so low back then, that even 0 fee transactions could make it in and bring a bit of common sense logic and you can quickly determine that full blocks is actually not just normal, but a requirement for properly working cryptocurrency. And the converse: all shitcoins without full blocks are by definition scams and flawed.

A coin can be locked with a complex script, multiple combinations of private keys and possibly including timelocks and alternative spending conditions. Signing a message with one (or even multiple keys) does not guarantee those key(s) can actually send the coin.
Also: nothing in the bitcoin system depends on a signed messages (other than actual transactions), so it's only a cute extra feature which can actually be a footgun for people not understanding what's exactly going in possibly causing them to loose privacy or get scammed. For example Gavin Andreesen getting scammed by Faketoshi.

Correction again, since you're clearly not understanding.


Miners don't need to agree. Nobody gives a fuck when they mine invalid blocks. Well, I guess you'd not even call them Bitcoin miners at all if they don't produce valid blocks, so in that sense all miners de facto agree. But nobody is forcing them and they can stop agreeing whenever they want. They can go mine bcash or whatever shit they prefer.

\&gt; it's the other way around. Devs force  a new technology onto users. It's called segwit. Which requires  software updates in wallets etc. Don't mix cause and impact.
You're the one arguing for forcing a non-consensus hard fork change upon everybody and at the same time falsely claiming that segwit forces anybody to do anything. Which is clearly already disproven by the very fact you were complaining about in that blocks are only 1.2MB.
So not only are your arguments nonsense and factually false, they're also self contradictory.

There are many trolls who deliberately ask dumb questions filled with disinformation. (Bitcoin is about money, which is a huge incentive for deceiving people to make them buy into a scam.) People get tired of that quickly.
Also: Bitcoin is a very complex topic and it's not very effective if every newcomer comes in here and starts asking very basic questions. Like going into a quantum mechanics forum and asking  Do some homework first (links in the sidepanel) and do some googling. [bitcoin.stackexchange.com]( works very well for straight up questions and answers. Once you've passed a few rabbit holes you'll be able to ask better questions and take part in discussions.

Correction: they *sound* like good ideas. Con artists have a way of telling you what you want to hear.


(yeah, I'm censored on rbtc, so I answer here.)
Wow dude... you're far off track... it might be too late to save you from wasting a year of your life learning only lies and inconsistencies and ending up losing your money in some altcoin scam. Stay away from rbtc. Stop thinking you understand Bitcoin, you don't. You still need a year of making daily new discoveries and coming to insights and viewpoints. You're missing out on the true Bitcoin experience by depriving yourself of that.
I wish I could say that in a convincing way that doesn't sound like an rbtc troll saying the opposite.
But just look at which side is actually getting work done, delivering product and code and actual progress. Bigblockers have been at it for 3+ years and have achieved literally nothing but 3 incompatible failed hostile takeover attempts, which have forked off on the testnet already (since they don't test their code at all) and could do the same on the live network any moment. It's not for the lack of trying or the lack of bugs that that hasn't happened yet. Every version they pooped out was riddled with security holes, DOS vulnerabilities, consensus failures. But even before acknowledging a single one, they're already off pumping the next iteration of an equally braindead version. All the while promising golden mountains to everyone who follows them: we'll be VISA level within years and take over the world and your coins will be priceless and you'll all be filthy rich. Sure. As long as they censor anyone who speaks out with puny facts and cold hard logic, they can keep newcomers fooled.
Read some of the nullc posts in there and notice the more purely factual his posts are, the more downvotes he gets. Lala land don't appreciate facts.


That sounds a lot more sane already, although you're treading in dangerous waters with your investment.
Remember: decentralized is the only thing that distinguishes Bitcoin from other existing systems, lose that and it's over. The other factor you want with money is stability. And I don't even mean price stability really: stability and trust in the system.
@_date: 2016-10-17 01:20:32


Where have i disagreed with that?


I haven't seen your (or anyone elses) arguments that actually show this. There is however plenty of actual research and many solid arguments to the contrary. So if you want to be convincing, you better bring up some. Preferably peer reviewed.
Anyway, the reasoning is actually pretty simple as I'll detail below. Mostly using your own arguments (as i said before, your arguments actually support the Core position, you're just drawing the wing conclusions from them).


And that's exactly the problem. The mix of large and smaller miners will change. And guess which will be hit the hardest and be pushed out completely first?
Any rise in fixed cost is easy to absorb for a big miner but hard for a small miner. Same with any cost that is not directly and exactly proportional to having power; unless it negatively proportional, which is rare.


Only in absolute terms. Which is irrelevant. Of course you earn twice as much it you have twice as much hardware. But you'll also pay twice much for that hardware and more importantly you'll pay twice as much electricity. So in the end you earn the exact same percentage ROI.


And that's exactly one of the problem points. Large miners get a lower orphan rate (because they won't orphan themselves), which means small miners are fucked more often which means small miners earn less and eventually quit. That means large miners get bigger which means more centralisation. So what is our top priority for this issue: keep the orphan rate (for ALL miners) as close to zero as possible. Hence "headers first", libsecp1k, trust network, compact transactions, FIBRE, segwit, and a shitload of other performance enhancements. The faster a block gets spread around and gets validated the lies chance of orphan blocks. Larger blocks will raise those times (not necessarily linear: before segwit quadratically, but hopefully at some point even sublinearly, which means it would be a lot safer to raise the block size depending in where on the curve we are).


Again: you're stuck in absolute terms. You have to look at percentages for everything.
I would love to have 0.01% of all the hashing power at my home and i would be fine with not earning millions. 0.01% of all earnings would be perfectly fine and enough for me. If 10,000 people did the exact same thing we'd be in Bitcoin utopia.
Unfortunately today i would earn only 0.005% (number out of my ass) while big miners that have 20% earn like 22%. Meaning a big miner can either wait until i go out of business (and his percentage goes up automatically) or hr can buy more equipment with his earnings (and his percentage would go up too). 


The thing is, most of your arguments are mostly correct. You're just drawing the wing conclusions or off them. I said so before. You're so close to getting it.
Let go of the absolute view and think only in relative terms, and then reread your own arguments. It's all about percentages and what effect certain incentives or changes have on those percentages. If those percentages go up that means it's bad for decentralization.
You're really close.

You're talking bullocks and throw around some random words to pretend... I don't even know what you're pretending to do. You're transparantly ignorant on basic facts and can't even make sentences any sense.

@_date: 2016-10-25 11:19:37


No. If a super majority of nodes want to raise the blocksize then the *super majority* have to decide if raising the blocksize will earn them more money.
There's always this super minority that gets screwed over and once they're gone some other become the minority.
Also there are very big differences between short term and long term benefits in your proposal. It's easy to find examples in life where such a situation causes huge problems.


What's wrong for the (large) miners is not the same as what's wrong for Bitcoin. That's not aligned. Also once stuff is centralized, it's extremely hard (if not impossible) to reverse that process. You don't simply reduce the block size and expect everything to go back to normal. Besides, mining is already too centralized today, so do we start by halving the block size then?

Attack surface is not measured in bytes...
@_date: 2016-10-13 09:04:03


No. First of all the definition of a soft fork is that it allows LESS than before. Only a hard fork allows transactions that were invalid in the old version.
Look at it this way: if the 2 of us (and one miner) agree to do segwit like transactions today that would be perfectly valid and nobody would care that we did. Sure, we'd have a problem that we could cheat eachother. Miners or maybe even 3rd parties could cheat us too. But that's only because we would not have the backing of the majority of the mining power, it doesn't have anything to do with the transactions being valid or not.
Or looked at in the other way: you can choose not to upgrade your client to support segwit and you lose nothing. You're still perfectly safe. Now at some point if segwit gets some real use, it's probably a good idea to at least put some read-only segwit support into your client so you get a better view of what's actually happening, but even then you're not forced to really use segwit.
And you still enjoy the benefits of the magically emptier blocks even if you don't upgrade at all.
Also: Hard Forks are a lot more dangerous anyway, which was recently proven by the Ethereum debacle. A hard fork can only have two safe outcomes: 100% acceptance or 100% rejection, anything in between is a complete shitshow which damages everybody. Luckily all hard fork attempts on Bitcoin have been 100% failures, which reenforces the need to outcast all devs and people involved in those hard fork attempts completely. They are completely reckless, dangerous and untrustworthy. You don't attempt a hard fork if you're not 100% sure of success, if you do anyway you're an attacker and need to be kicked out, never to return.


Evil shit is always possible anyway, that has nothing to do with hard fork/soft fork. Each update will always need to have been extremely well designed and reviewed and tested and then accepted by miners and users. You can't simply block all evil things by making soft forks harder (they're always possible anyway).
"the scale of segwit" is large, but it's certainly not the biggest change done to Bitcoin so far. I think I've seen mentioned that it's like 20% of all changes done in an update (or maybe in a whole year, don't remember exactly). That means 4x a much code changes are (and have been) done regularly. Sure, not all code changes are equal, but also coding is not also complete wizardry if the devs are skilled and experienced.


You've been misinformed. Everything about Bitcoin is complex. Everything is relative. SegWit is not hugely or overly (and certainly not unnecessarily) complex and in fact it cleans up both the code a lot as well as incentives. Currenty creating a UTXO is cheaper than destroying one, leading to UTXO set growth (the most important scaling parameter) and more dust (lost money, yet remaining a burden on the system). SegWit makes creating and destroying a UTXO equally priced. Which in turn allows for simpler code in wallets in their fee calculations and optimization (which all wallets do pretty badly today).
The malleability fix also has benefits for wallets, allowing their code to become simpler and safer.


If you agree all (or most) of the benefits of segwit are desirable, then a segwit hard fork would be exactly as complex. You're misinformed if you think that's a choice.
Also, postponing malleability fix and squared hashing and the rest of segwit in favor of first increasing the block size is completely retarded. A block size increase would be almost as complex but leave out most of the benefits of segwit and only give us a temporary workaround for the squared hashing. That leaves us with no improved performance, none of the real fixes, none of the cleanup benefits yet all of the dangers plus actual technical debt in the form of an extra arbitrary limitation that will have to be remained compatible with until perpetuity.

How dare you demand they go back to not earning a cent and doing all this work as a hobby evenings and weekends in between 9-to-5 day jobs?

Tell that to blockchain.info or coinbase.com or ethereum.


Well, if I wanted to see your bullshit from a positive side, at least you're saying Core is producing quality of a level worthy of attempting to match.


Not a single one can withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny. Nor is there a single one that includes many solutions to more important problems than block size. Nor is there a single one fully safely implemented and fully tested. In fact, one of those so called solutions forked itself AND another so called solution off the testnet recently. And nobody even noticed for more than a month. That's the level of coding quality and testing thoroughness we're talking about here.
It's all a complete pile of stinking dog shit being sold on a silver platter to gullible idiots. Bon appetit to you, but no thanks.

I for example have been banned there for saying exactly something hypothetical, that nullc has since said on at least 3 separate occasions.


It's actually from a technical understanding of a level that you can't even dream of.

They wasted weeks/months of your time with their false promises and fake marketing material. They caused you to make a complete ass out of yourself. They used your gullibilty to make you sell their snake oil to others. Time to re-evaluate, starting by realising that literally everything they told you is a lie and never ever to trust those scammers again. Good luck.

Once your client is synced up the amount will appear again.
Also: you've had the same happen with your transaction on 2019-08-06 00:11:34, you just didn't notice because the amounts were much smaller (or you synced the chain far enough).
All the green ones on that page are individual coins that happen to share the same address (which btw is bad, you should not reuse addresses). Individual coins can only be spent whole and then you get change back as a fresh coin in a new address. Exactly like coins and bills in the USD wallet in your pocket.
It's probably a good idea to upgrade to a newer version: syncing will be quicker and make it easier to not re-use addresses. It also might make sense to let the wallet sync up every now and then (once a month or whatever) so you don't get behind this far to begin with.

They do. Every single day. And have been consistently for 3+ years. All you have to do is not stick your head in the sand.


I seriously doubt that, apart from the doubling that is already on the way. Even jtoomim said 3 or 4 at the very max, considering he forgot a few considerations and that we want to keep a reasonable safety margin, that ends you up around 2MB, which is roughly what segwit provides.
And even if you find one core dev who says 10MB, consensus requires that ALL relevant people she, not just one.

You're right, but that's actually quite hard because uptake is measured between difficult adjustment boundaries.

When you run a full node, you literally don't give a fuck about ping times. Why would you care you get a block 5ms earlier? You've been waiting for 10 minutes already anyway!
Only mining nodes really care about latency.

Thanks to relative locktimes they can keep extending a channel. They're also working on allowing you to hand over the job of monitoring a channel to someone else without giving up any privacy information about that channel. So a monitoring party doesn't know what it's looking at but it can monitor the blockchain and react on your behalf to close the channel for you if the other side tries to cheat. So you don't even need to be online yourself.

No, I don't agree, you're reading the definition of hard/soft fork wrong. The definition only refers to what the consensus rules define as valid or invalid. The consensus rules define the laws of nature, we're free to do with those laws whatever we want.
Satoshi gave us a big bang that defined the laws of nature and the physical constants. He only made planet earth inhabitable for transactions, but soon we started making Mars and Venus habitable as well. Now we're on the virge of making Jupiter habitable. We're not forcing anyone to move, but Jupiter is a more efficient and beautiful place to live on.
The universe is enormous but we're only using a tiny part of it. Soft forks allow us to use new unexplored parts that (if well designed) can co-exist and be not at war with each other.
Hard forks are like a whole new big bang with different physical constants and laws. But that new universe will be in competition with the old universe over the available energy (hashing power). Very messy.


SegWit isn't. It follows the old rules and it adds a few more even stricter rules.
I have read that soft forks could potentially be evil, although I can't really think of an example right now that would be really bad. But hard forks can of course certainly be evil too. Both can be good or bad. Either way, it's up to the current users and miners to guard the system against evil changes.
BTW there are also evil changes that are neither hard nor soft fork: non-consensus changes can also be evil. That's another thing the network as a whole needs to be robust against. Actually, those are even harder and more important to guard against than evil soft/hard forks as those forks at least require a majority. Non consensus changes can be run by single individuals. Centralization is one such danger and that's why it has top-priority of the Core devs.


I don't believe that's true at all. Old clients will never accept more than 21M coins so this can't be a soft fork. A soft fork could hide a whole new merkle tree of subcoins inside a coinbase output, but those are subcoins and not bitcoins. They will get their own value and as long as nobody accepts them they'll be worthless. That's basically just a complex way of doing a 51% attack.
Beware that the guy you're quoting is actively lobbying the SEC to declare Bitcoin a ponzi scheme. Actively trying to destroy Bitcoin. Although he's an academic computer scientist that knows the basics of how Bitcoin works, there are many many details that he gets flat out wrong.


The premise doesn't hold. There are no exploits. Even if the method by which segwit gets introduced could potentially be used for evil, that still doesn't make segwit evil. That's like saying knifes can cut your finger, so ban all knifes.
Also consider this: segwit requires 95% of the miners to agree. The XT hardfork requires less than 75% (they measure the percentage in a deceitful way, making it more like 70%). Which sounds more like consensus and safer to you? (Of course miners are not the only ones to agree in the consensus, but that's the only group we can measure in a trustless manner. At least for segwit all devs have already reached consensus, XT has only the opposite of consensus from the devs).


Now a whole different perspective. As mentioned above: a lot of responsibility rests on the shoulders of the community as a whole to protect Bitcoin and the consensus rules against evil forks or other actions. I'm all for adding more protections that help with this ongoing task. Hardening Bitcoin. Making Bitcoin more robust. That means making things more decentralized (in all kinds of ways) so that we don't have to trust a few big miners or a few big hodlers (economic users) or a few important developers. The more of all of those the better.
The devs are possibly the easiest though: they can be kept in check by thoroughly double checking their work in an objective manner. We hold them to gold standards and have them walk a strict path of peer review and testing etc.
Miners: well we need them to be more decentralized. So we need to take away centralization pressures (hard, but still some way to go) and try to come up with decentralization-pressure (that's really hard).
Economic users (hodlers and users paying/accepting Bitcoin) : one problem is that a lot of users are using SPV wallets or even web wallets or straight up exchanges. All those place the actual control in the hands of individuals who get a lot of power from it. So for example wallets need to become better to convince more users to start using them. But even SPV wallets can be improved a lot by having them do more actual validation (currently they basically fully trust the full node they connect to). The more people do more validation locally, the better the network as a whole is robust against evil forks (soft or hard) or other attacks. Mike Hearn (SPV wallet library dev) refused to implement many possible improvements in that area (in hindsight exactly because he was planning to do an evil hard fork).


Segwit as a hard fork would only be different in 1 tiny way. Literally a few lines of code. Instead of putting the Merkle root hash of the segwit tree in a coinbase output, it would be put in a separate new header field. So instead of referring to it as Header-&gt;Coinbase[0] you'd refer to it as Header-&gt;SegWitRoot (pseudocode). That's literally it. Don't believe those idiots on rbtc that have no idea what they are talking about and prove they have hidden agendas by coming up with this bullshit in the first place.
You have to know that the segwit idea and most of the code was already almost a year old (and running in a live system) by the time the soft fork version was dreamed up.
Also rolling out a soft fork is much easier and safer for everybody than rolling out a soft fork. 


I don't know much about flexible transactions (as I don't like to waste time on shit), but I've seen it shot down already. I also know it's being suggested and developed by completely incompetent part time amateur devs. I know it's being pushed by misguided, deceitful and outright lying people, like Roger Ver. I know it doesn't fundamentally solve the actual issues like malleability but at best just works around them. And I know it doesn't make sense to now (on the verge of the segwit rollout) to start with a whole new development cycle and wait for a year for that to mature and be ready for a rollout.
@_date: 2016-10-15 11:18:21
All "Nakamoto consensus" is is a tie-breaker in case there are multiple *valid* candidate blocks, where each node will independently come to the same conclusion (i.e. consensus) so that the chain can progress.
Note the word "valid". What is valid is not decided or even defined by Nakamoto consensus. "Valid" is a precondition before Nakamoto consensus even kicks in.
The definition of "valid" is a human thing: initially set by satoshi with small changes (by him and others) later on. Each of those changes has had to reach consensus between devs (indenting) and among users and miners (by upgrading their software). That consensus process is very much different than Nakamoto consensus. It's simply a mix of science, open source development, per review, testing and eventually free market forces where users choose the version they run. Unfortunately some deceitful and ignorant people also add politics and trolling to that process.

Would still have been a hard fork. In fact it would ONLY have been a hard fork if 100% went along. Now it's just a altcoin splitting off. It's not a hard fork because it has nothing to do with Bitcoin in any way. Bitcoin didn't fork at all that day.

Nothing political about it. Poor technical.
So throw all those political arguments overboard and see what your left with: Core devs that know goddamn well what they're talking about and are actively working hard to improve efficiency to allow for gradually bigger blocks, but not importantly more transactions per second and even more importantly more decentralization and fungibility.
And guess what they are delivering literally next week or whatever? A doubling of the blocksize. Wow. Done. Literally nothing left to whine about. 
If you think it wasn't quick enough and should have been done a year ago then you should have done it yourself or paid people to do it. And you would have had to have done all the work and research and inventions of the last 3 years in 2.

It's very significant. It makes it hard to impossible to spend or chain unconfirmed transactions. Which causes e.g. exchanges to have to do many extra transactions to split their coins before they can send them to clients. More UTXO bloat, more transactions, more dust, more fees.
Malleability also complicated all kinds of 3rd party software interfacing with the RPC interface. As well as all kinds of smart contracts including payment channels.

@_date: 2016-10-28 11:39:57
If the demand is as high as you fear it is, uptake of segwit will be very fast. If it doesn't go that fast then apparently enough people are willing to pay higher fees. The choice is up to the users, no need to push any harder.
Also: segwit not only increases the block size. Thanks to its other advantages, like the malleability fix and efficiency advantages for multi-sig transactions, certain users can optimize their procedures to create fewer and smaller transactions to begin with. 
One example are exchanges that need to do lots of payouts. Currently they have to split coins into smaller outputs beforehand so they can use one output at a time to payout a customer. After segwit anti malleability they could change that to simply do one payout to one customer and then (without waiting for a confirmation) use the change in the next transaction for the next customer. Chaining transactions like thiis more than halves the number of transactions they make as well as reduces the remaining dust.
Another trick they can do is RBF: send the payout to one customer but as long as it's not confirmed yet, simply replace that transaction by one that pays two customers and then 3... 4... all in one transaction.
Some use cases can be significantly optimized to reduce the total number of transactions and make them smaller. You won't see this as a "block size" increase, but it has the same effect: more "useful" transactions per block.
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:47:13

Not peer reviewed. Not tested. In fact it blew up testnet.
But yeah you're right. It's been running on the live chain for a long time now, yet nobody is stupid enough to run it, partly for the reasons above. Partly because the devs are just complete incapable retards. Partly because the few followers are are lying trolls. Partly because most people are smart enough to not throw away their own money. And plento of more reasons.
But because nobody is stupid enough to run it, it doesn't get activated and is a mere lingering reduction of security of and an ongoing attack on for the whole network. Ah well... it's just peanuts anyway.

Core has had that for a while already and a much better and actually working version. Compact Blocks. As well as FIBRE network.
Plagiarizing BU devs took a years old outdated idea from Core devs from years ago, didn't notice the then unsolved shortcomings in it, put their own name on it and started overselling it with lying statistics as some sort of magical compression algorithm. Oh and they added some security vulnerabilities while they were at it. That was probably like a year ago or so.

"we" is the miners. Miners will run segwit and then later (presumably reasonably soon after) a HF will be released (where released means a BIP with working code or something like that: nobody can promise consensus and an actual rollout).
But yeah that whole document is quite weird in places. I haven't bothered giving much fucks about it. The whole idea that deals are being made like this goes against what a decentralised bitcoin is.
It's ok if devs say: "this is what were working on and how long we think it's going to take (so far as they have control over that anyway) etc." And then miners/users can say "sure, that sounds good, I'll wait for that" or "nah, I'm going with a better alternative". That's about as much as would make sense. Political deals like "if you include this then we'll promise to not do that" are just outrageous. I'm not sure to what degree this document falls in either of those categories.

Just because they largely agree and work in the same direction doesn't make it one group. It only makes sense that they do since the alternative is a bunch of retards.

Gavin's deceitful 75% was actually a lot lower in practice as it was very likely for a "lucky streak" of blocks to reach 75% very shortly and thereby trigger the fork. 70% or less would eventually likely already trigger.

You're including much more complex and larger transactions. LN openings/closings are typically smaller than that. Also segwit will reduce some of that overhead and incentivize people to more efficient and allow them to make fewer transactions. So you're far underestimating things here.




Or make transactions smaller and more efficient.


Why the rush. You need to be somewhere by tomorrow?

That's only part of it, but sure. ("Distributed" would also fit your description.)


Which is incorrect, you'll be plesantly surprised to learn.
You don't need to store everything -&gt; pruning.
You don't need to "compute" everything. In fact the standard client doesn't check signatures for all old transactions. And if you wish  you could trivially change your client to only check a random 10% of the signatures (plus the ones you're really interested in).
After segwit you'll be free to chose to not even download the witness data (only the parts you're really interested in). Or do a random sampling again there.


That's very much apples to oranges. DHTs have very different requirements, properties and uses.


Apart from the point mentioned above and future improvements (for example UTXO or TXO commitments), that all disprove your statement already, what kind of technology are you thinking of that would avoid this flaw you mention? Just a direction would suffice, I don't need all details straight up.

You got the history wrong. That event turned out to be not related to the new version. It was a lingering bug that could have happened anyway.

I can agree on that, although it does nicely prove the hypocrisy on someone screaming and pushing agendas for blocksize increase while just having unloaded their externalities on the blockchain first.


Only to shitcoins, allowing them to suck liquidity from bitcoin and putting the exchange owner in a nice middleman position able to suck up bribes and premines from shitcoin pumps.


Which is what (core) devs had been warning about for 5+ years, yet they get fully shat on for "causing it" and backstabbed when they come up with solutions. Including and not in the least by the person we're talking about here.
I'm not complaining about what he said and did (if Bitcoin can't survive that, then so be it), I'm complaining about his blatant hypocrisy and manipulation of history, trying to paint himself a saint. Liars and scammers need to be warned against and certainly not forgotten.
@_date: 2016-10-26 11:00:04


You said it. Large miner's advantage means disadvantage for small miners: small miners get fucked and eventually quit. No way around that.


Which large miners earn more of...


There are more. Nullc regularly cites them. And there's also bigblock-nutcase jtoomim that said 3MB max. And there's excellent posts by almost all devs. And it's actually bloody obvious. Oh and bigblockers have 0 peer reviewed research, only inconsistent never published and all-round debunked garbage like that of Peter R. And blabbery by Gavin that he himself proved wrong by silently abandoning proposal after proposal and jumping on the next size-du-jour.
Anyway, you just agreed to 4MB. That study actually left out a few factors and it only makes sense to keep a bit of safety margin, so you'll be glad to know we're moving to almost 2MB next month and beyond soon after. Thanks to devs that produce actual code instead of just empty impossible promises.


All the more reason to take it slow.


Yep, which makes my argument even stronger. Fixed cost is much less of a problem for large miners.


So it's ok to just make it worse? Or give up on improving it? That problem is not boolean, is a scale: between negligible and insurmountable.


So you agree the way the problem manifests itself will change, but you already have the foregone conclusion that the problem will not become larger i.e. more centralizing? How do you jump that gap?


Ok, so you agree it hasn't been for the last years and still isn't yet. That means all bigblock proposals so far have been dangerous and way too rushed. It shows that Core was correct to first work on achieving sub linearity (and let's remind ourselves who the people were that actually did that hard work) and only then raise the block size. Which is what will happen next month.
And in as far as the meme has grown that Core wants 1MB forever or is stalling for nefarious reasons, that's also debunked here then.


For the normal case yes, but good programming requires minding the worst case (the worst random case) and security sensitive applications are even harder: they need to guard against malicious cases: the worst that an evil miner willing to spend some money can deliberately do to DOS or for personal long term gain.


Careful there. The fees go to one miner, possibly the evil one. The costs and/or loss of income go to other miners and all full nodes IOW the whole Bitcoin network.


Can't remember the context details and can't look it up on mobile now. When comparing miners you absolutely have to think in terms of percentages as it does matter. First of all the whole mining is a chance game. Chances are percentages. Furthermore a 30% miner has a 30% chance of finding the next block too, so for that 30% it's certain to not get orphaned. A 1% miner only has a 1% "orphan protection". It's impossible to not use percentages. And even then it can become complex as it's not always clear what 100% represents at a particular moment (for example during times when the network is partitioned for whatever reason, for example when 2 blocks have been found at the same time). Difficulty adjustments do make things more complex again, although most trends still hold.


So you have this enormously complex black box with all kinds of technical and economical and malicious processes going on inside. And you know that when you turn the dials, the internal working and the outputs will change. But you know for certain that the centralisation output won't change?
And at the same time you agreed with the sublinear thing above. So at least before SegWit and the other improvements the centralisation output would have changed?
Note how sublinear doesn't mean constant: the value still changes. So you are certain that this black box does not have a hidden cog somewhere that can amplify the effects of a snail sublinear change to cause a whole different output? Or maybe a threshold, invisible as long as you're below but big effects once you hit it? Possibly around 30% or 50% miner sizes? Or when propagation and validation delay nears x% of the 10 minutes? (Random examples.)
Surely you'll agree that 1TB blocks every 10 minutes would change centralisation? Not even CERN can keep up with that for long. So clearly at least one amplifying factor and/or threshold exists.


I hope i gave some pointers above. The gap. Uncertainties about the black box. Safety margin. Sub linear not fully achieved yet (next month hopefully).
In general, it looks to me Core is working hard to fix those issues one by one in a careful well thought out manner and once it becomes safe to take a step they're just as eager as anyone else to increase the block size. It takes time to do the research to find the underlying issues, to come up with solutions, to develop fixes, to peer review, to test and to reach consensus. Luckily many issues are worked on in parallel otherwise it would really take forever.
@_date: 2016-10-31 00:16:34


How is that not the same for end users?


Why would they?


Says who? You? Where is your peer reviewed research that proves it safe?
Also: the suggested method up doing 2MB hard fork was developed by completely incapable devs and proven riddled with bugs and security problems. It was so much untested code that testnet blew up and they didn't even notice for a month.
Even if we wanted to do this compromise you talk about, there is no code ready to run. Implementing segwit turned out to be faster than creating a hard fork "that changes one constant". If that doesn't show you the utter incompetence of bigblock devs, i don't know what will.

Why not? A and B can sign a transaction moving the funds from the channel to a new channel and A can add some more funds. As long as that new transaction is below 6 confirmations, A and B simply run both old and new channel parallel in mirrored mode, signing the exact same transactions for both channels.
Same method for sending part of the funds inside a channel to a non-LN bitcoin address, leaving the remainder in the channel.
From the users perspective it's like topping up or partly withdrawing from a channel without ever closing it.

Yes it is. It scales in the dimensions we actually need scaling in. As opposed to any blockchain.


That community saved Bitcoin and the value+future value it represents. You should be thanking them for not being stupid.

Then they clearly don't understand bitcoin. At all. There are no deals in bitcoin. There are no deals in science.
And calling it 2MB is another obvious disengenuous lie and thus yet another reason to reject it: SegWit alone is already &gt; 2MB.

Just being excited about cool tech, I guess. Wasn't really trying to sell it. :)
Anyway, I agree staying realistic is good. Just saying there are more scaling benefits to segwit than just captured in the often quoted 1.7 number. As well as the fact that demand will smoothly steer the speed of adoption, so slow adoption is not an indication of a problem anyway (if anything, it would be an indication that further increases are not high priority).
Anyway, looking forward to nov 15th.

Faster blocks has the same plus more dangers as larger blocks.
Speed of light is finite and the propagation time MUST be insignificantly small compared to the block time, otherwise mining is not fair as some miners will receive a block earlier than others and thus get a headstart on the next block.
(This btw shows why all shitcoins with a lower block time are scams.)
It also doesn't solve any use cases: whether you wait 10 minutes or 5 doesn't really matter and thanks to randomness it would still sometimes take 30 minutes, so you can't rely on it anyway.
@_date: 2016-10-25 02:48:12
Those questions must be up thread somewhere, I haven't seen them.
Your first point is pretty easy to answer though: BU gives miners control over the block size. Large miners have an easier time handling big blocks, smaller miners not so much (bandwidth cost, diskspace, CPU costs etc.).
These two facts combined mean that large miners can make life harder for small miners by simply increasing the blocksize. Every second that a small miner is not mining (on the right block) means more profit goes to the miners that are mining (the larger ones). Hence the small miners go out of business and only the large miners remain.
Your other question requires knowledge of how BU is specifically implemented, which I don't have. It's not hard to imagine though that they royally fucked up their implementation and incentives (they have a track record of that sort of thing), so I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest.

Quite a few, although more would be better. Thousands.


We're not at the mercy of miners and those full nodes are exactly what prevents us from being so. That's a safety feature Bitcoin can not do without.


It's not about what you or I think. It's about scientific research and what the people that have to do the work come to agree.


Just upgrade to 0.13.1 next week or so and sit back and relax. That's the quickest way to 2mb blocks.


The most important "support" a full node can give the network is decentralization of economic power, meaning you hold and/or transact money using that node. That fact makes the full node a voice against evil hard forks, protecting you from los of money as well as making bitcoin more decentralised.


You might want to configure them to connect to your own full node. Possibly over Tor.

There's a punishment trick in LN where if one party is trying to cheat by cashing in an older transaction, then the victim can send a punishment transaction to the blockchain that takes the entire contents of the channel.
The sending of this punishment transaction can be outsourced where the 3rd party can't steal anything nor learns anything regarding your privacy (in the normal situation) and only learns very little if the punishment transaction is actually used.
I don't really know if any writeup, although I'm sure it's out there. Rusty Russell's blog highly likely. Christian Decker also has a blog i think and if I'm not mistaken he's the one who perfected this feature. I'm fairly sure there was a presentation on this on Scalingbitcoin.org Milan.


Redeeming in this case simply means broadcasting a presumed transaction to the blockchain. I can give you a presigned transaction today and ask you "if X happens, then please broadcast this transaction". Where X is some event on the blockchain and the prepared transaction takes all the coins from X (which is otherwise time locked) and send them to me.
If X never happens you don't know anything about me. If X does happen you know those coins now belong to me (but i may be anonymous to you if i used Tor to give you the transaction). You can't​steal any coins. The worst you can do is not send the transaction. But maybe i sent the same transaction to 10 other people and only one of them needs to. So there's not much opportunity for you to collude with the other party: you don't know him and he doesn't know you nor the other 10 people and maybe I'm online myself.


I think they do something with a deterministic secret or something where only a few bytes need to be communicated every now and then. I Don't recall the details. It's pretty darn clever for sure.

I'd say the fact that a well designed, developed, peer reviewed, tested and bug/DOS-free hard fork still does not exist, even after 3 years of this "change one constant" talk and several failed attempts, is quite indicative of how difficult such a change really is. Whether the reason is technical or political doesn't even matter that much.


Only in a very short sighted short term definition. n^2 hashing already makes any increase of that constant outright impossible. So that needs to be fixed first.
Segwit actually simplifies a lot of code within Bitcoin as well as in 3rd party libraries and applications, as well as making thing inherently more fool proof and safe.
And then there's the political and practical stuff around rolling it out. Soft forks are inherently safer and smoother to roll out.


Nothing is 100% bug free, but at least they're not as plentiful and shallow as in current XT/classic/unlimited code.


No idea what you're getting at here. I said XT/classic/unlimited have not produced a single useful line of code in three years. And they're now back to ripping out botched n^2 hashing limits and replacing them with .... nothing.
Core is open source, if they want to copy/paste solutions, they're more than welcome to. If even that's too hard for them, maybe that says enough about their (lack of) dev skills.

One reason is that it's simply not true. A Hard Fork would not be significantly simpler (in fact if you include getting consensus and rolling it out, it's much much harder) and it wouldn't be significantly less code either. Devs have said on the order of 5 lines of code difference. They had already created a hard fork version for Elements Alpha (sidechain) and have said now they're glad they were able to redo it as soft fork. Much more elegant solution.

Bullshit lie. Very very unlikely. And if it does it's mere proof that people don't need bigger blocks. 


Lie. Not to people that know what they are talking about. Similar and higher levels of complexity changes have been done before. It's also the best and simplest (and probably only) method of achieving what it does: fixing malleability and safe scaling.


Lie. It's exactly known and extremely small. And SW actually reduces enormous amounts of technical debt: malleability is a huge one.


Deceitful lie. It's not that simple at all.


Proven lie: bigblockers have said that for at least a year yet nothing has appeared.


What good is that? Disrupts the fee market. You don't have trust in actual users deciding when they're ready to upgrade, you want to force your will on them?


Lie again. It maintains malleability debt and doubles (or quadruples for quadratic variables, for example bytes hashed during transaction validation) the negative effects of other existing debt. 


Where consensus is that it's an outright dangerous and stupid path to go down.


Who's totally inexperienced and unqualified in coding or designing consensus solutions. But the measurements that he did make proved people like 20GB-trust-me-I-tested-it-Gavin completely wrong and showed that 3MB was the extreme max safe blocksize. Considering that he ignored a few factors and that we also want a bit of a safety margin it's clear that SW provides the best possible block size increase for now (apart from the more important changes it makes).


Except pretending a simpler solution is possible is a lie, and that simpler solution doesn't exist nor is ready for roll out. The choice is move forward now with the best possible and well tested and peer reviewed solution or expose your motivation is not scaling but just obstructing progress.
So... Time to run back to your rbtc chiefs for the next list of lies to parrot.

Depends on the sort of transactions. And at least that means that people wanting to do more complex transactions don't put much burden on other people as they would have before.

Like sending bitcoins. That "application" was broken if you tried to do one after the other quickly (without waiting for confirmations). People had to build workarounds (splitting coins beforehand, i.e. filling blocks and UTXO set). People lost money because of it, although likely not as much as MtGox claimed to have lost to malleability.


Which is why he made bitcoin updatable. That mechanism was improved over the years and is now being used to do the SegWit update.
Whatever predictions you want to make: the most important scenario to watch out for is the worst case. We talking about money here. Money attracts the worst of the worst humans. It's also money that competes with very powerful entrenched parties who will do anything to squish this bug.

Thanks for furthering my argument yet again: a miner causing 30% of the network to drop off completely doesn't sound like a bad thing to you? In other words: by playing smart a miner can disable 30% of his competition: upgrade the 70% on his side to earn 100% of the income.
You clearly need to drop your predrawn conclusion and let science run its course. Every argument you bring up brings you closer to the correct conclusion.


I thought i quoted that fairly specifically, but let me zoom in a little further, you said:


That's false and destroys any theories and conclusions you built on top of that.
A miner would LOVE to make a block that only propagates to 60% of the network. Even worse: the others in that 60% would LOVE to help him with that.


I saw that as another attempt to change the subject, so i didn't respond. But if you insist.
SW is a soft fork. Technically it would only need 51% and would be fine. But SW users would like some certainty that enough miners guarantee their transactions, so 70 or 80% maybe. Technically and for safety that would be plenty. The reason much higher (95%) is required is more a principal (political) reason: bitcoin is not a democracy where simple majority rules. It requires much higher consensus. It's very admirable of the devs to hold themselves to such a high moral standard. It is up to all users to guard this principle and to object whenever someone proposed a contentious change: shun devs (or worse: non-devs) that propose such changes. Those attackers need to be made outcasts and made sure they never get another chance to attack bitcoin.
Clearly some of those "all users" still have to learn, seeing as how former multiple offenders like Gavin and Ver and xt/classic/unlimited supporters keep rearing their deceitful heads.
Anyway remember that even if your one of the 5% you don't need to care one serving about SW. You still have a choice to completely ignore it and you'll be perfectly fine. Still protected. (... here come the next batch of rbtc lies...)
But you were of course hinting at a hard fork. Hard forks by definition need 100% consensus: any stragglers are forcefully kicked off.

Malleability fix is pretty damn nice to have. Allows chaining transactions (instead of wastefully presplitting outputs), makes some smart contracts safer and simpler, makes building software using bitcoind RPC simpler and safer.
All kinds of other optimisations and bug and DOS vulnerability fixes (of this and previous and upcoming releases) are very welcome. Less bandwidth use, faster block propagation.
And if you don't agree with running segwit yet, you can simply keep running an old version. Or if you want the other benefits but without segwit, it should be fairly easy to run the new version but with segwit disabled (for whatever you want that to mean). No rush.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:34:28
As opposed to what? .... crickets... no alternative. nothing. status quo.
So you're sabotaging a clear safe and gradual path to more than 4x scaling even without LN just because what? You don't have any alternative. You don't have a single capable dev, or expert that can even come up with an alternative. There's no alternative possible anyway, as clearly any potential solution will have to include SegWit at the very minimum

I've probably seen people in rbtc that extreme, but you're right, those are probably nobodies we can safely disregard (as I'm sure one could find an avoid hard fork at all cost extremist if you'd look hard enough).


True. And the core devs were even working towards a HF until the Sw SF option was discovered.


But none did, which proves it wasn't. A HF requires much much more than just an idea or a BIP (many BIPS popped up around then). It requires a very good and peer reviewed design, then an extremely well written and peer reviewed and tested code implantation. And then the hard part starts: an extreme degree of consensus is required. Among devs and economic users and miners. If the noise over a fully backwards compatible and optional update like SW is any indication, a non-compatible the-whole-world-must-update-at-the-same-time hard fork must be even harder.
Then there are the many prerequisites that many people would have demanded before agreeing to any block size increase would be safe in the first place: libsecpk1, headers first, compact blocks, FIBRE and many many more optimisations and security improvements.
Anyway all HF proposals got stuck in the very first step. None exists today that even remotely meets any standards. Bigblockers had enough time to do a serious attempt and maybe they could have made a good proposal to get consensus around. Instead they failed to design anything, failed to code anything, failed to document anything, failed to test anything,

Asking honest questions might help there. Parroting lies as if fact does not.
Your whole post betrays utter lack of understanding on many levels. Why do you think you're informed enough to have a meaningful opinion that anyone should listen to?
For example:


1. Segwit *IS* a block size limit increase.
2. Further improvement, including a block size limit hard fork, *ARE* on the roadmap.

Sorry, I didn't mean the wiki is bad or lacking. That's absolutely the best place for documentation and such, especially when written by expert writers like yourself.
I feel SE serves a slightly different purpose. But the biggest thing, I think, is that it seems to group similar questions asked by hundreds of people in different wording towards a single answer. That means that (eventually) whenever someone is googling, she will arrive at the right answer irregardless of the exact wording used in the question.
I'm sure you've seen this happen when googling anything for example software or web development related: almost always the first hit will be the correct answer on SE, often even quoted on top of the result page. Bitcoin SE doesn't seem to have reached that level yet.

We're talking about relative differences. A 10% miner should earn no more than 10x of a 1% miner. Economies of scale need to be as small as possible. The fact that that currently is not the case doesn't mean we shouldn't try try make it better, let alone make it worse.


That would be a horrible situation. So no, there nothing "of course" about that. And yes that has a shitton to do with blocksize.

You just made any hard fork an impossibility. Thanks for seeing the light (you certainly took your time) and agreeing soft forks are the only way to go, as well as much better and friendlier to everybody, especially old nodes. You're right. HardForkers are scum for even suggesting such vile incompatible crap. How dare they suggest to destroy everything just to change a simple constant? It brings not a single improvement or fix, just one freaking constant! All that risk and disruption for one constant. A constant that has already been proven to be very dangerous, quadratic hashing at least, but likely all decentralization will go to shit. And then it was developed by those that brought us 3 complete wipeout bugs in a month's time? Financed by a miner taking in money over the backs of the whole community by cheating and blocking progress as well as mining empty blocks all the time. Cheerleaded by a convicted felon, proven scammer and liar, pumping alt coins and attacking the only people in the world smart enough to actually come up with a real solution.
I'm sure you'll agree we're extremely thankful to those hardworking experts for actually inventing and finishing such a solution despite all the shit slung their way by disgusting trolls. And we're double thankful that it is a backwards compatible solution safe for old nodes and it in. An awesome soft fork, that will become a textbook example of awesome engineering where one simplifying change fixes 5 different long standing hard problems at once. The pinnacle of software engineering genius.

I think we agree on what latency means. The thing is: only mining nodes care about latency. Non mining full nodes don't need to.
Regarding bandwidth: currently a new block causes a peak in bandwidth use much higher than a few kilobits. Also currently bandwidth use is double because transaction propagation. Like i said compact blocks will mostly smooth that out.

Only by doing an on-chain transaction, in cooperation with Bob.
Whether you call it closing+reopening or splicing or topping up or whatever doesn't really change that fact.
Completely closing and opening implies that the channel will be down (unusable) for a few hours or so. They can do better where the channel remains completely usable while the onchain transaction is being processed on the blockchain. Basically there are two channels (the old, being closed and the new being opened) that shadow each other perfectly: all LN transactions happen on both channels at the same time, so whenever a problem occurs where the channel needs to be broken down, either the state in the old channel is still valid and can be settled onchain or the state of the new channel is valid. But both states represent the exact same balance for Alice and Bob, so it doesn't matter which eventually settles.
So instead of closing+reopening you can hide that fact and morph one channel into a new channel, unnoticable to the user. Except that it's cheaper than a full close+open as it's done in one onchain transaction and thus saves on fees.
Whether you call it a new channel or just a continuation of the existing channel seems like semantics to me.

Also you'll quickly run into posts by jtoomim or zander or memorydealer (Roger Ver), or just complete trolls full of false accusations, lies, appeals to authority (satoshi intended), misquotes (satoshi said), complete non understandings of technical points and use of some sort of ill logic that a kindergartner should be ashamed of.

Would that possibly be...


and fixed rules and trust that the next person values those same rules.


I never agreed to not using sea shells either. 


Why assume that won't happen? It is happening. At enormous speed. Soft forks do that too. And there's even talk of a hard fork in the core roadmap.


Nov 15th. Plus more in pipeline.
Also if you were counting on VISA level block levels you've clearly deluded yourself for all those years.


Hmmm... The reverse of that statement makes more sense: if you're the one who wants to change the rules then you are the one who needs to do the work and convince everybody else to follow your new rules. It will very much concern you that nobody will follow your new rules.


Your certainly free to fork. XT/classic/unlimited have tried and failed already. Ver keeps threatening to do it, but doesn't have the balls. You'd be wise to investigate those cases before forking yourself.


Doesn't work. I accept Bitcoin because i expect to be able to spend them to you tomorrow. But if you're liable to fork off before tomorrow I'll be stuck with those coins. You are undermining the value of bitcoin and degrading fungibility.
Luckily you're not the only one to accept my bitcoin, so don't worry, I won't blame you. Plus I'm sure any such fork well fail anyway, so you'll be back soon enough.

Well, you better educate yourself some more on SegWit then if you want to lecture people.
It is a block size increase. Block = bunch of transactions, transactions = inputs+outputs+signatures. Guess what: it's all in a SegWit block. No, not even segregated. It's just in mixed in there just like it is in a non-SegWit block.
And if you want to be pedantic then SegWit actually eliminated the max block size completely. Poof. Gone. There's only a max block weight. And that's 4M.

You're a complete retard warping every sane definition to fit your insane view. You just can't let go of your geocentric epicycles.
1. For what? Block size. Who the fuck cares about block size anyway? That's the dumbest measure ever for a transaction system. The metric is transactions per second that counts. Schnorr and SA and MAST are going to significantly reduce the transaction size. Are you going to be whining that they're bad too because they don't increase the block size?
2. A 2 MB hard fork also leaves the block size at 1MB by your definition.
3. In SegWit blocks are still just a collection of transactions just like before and that's the only sane definition of a block. The thing that changes is actually in the transactions: there are two version of each transaction, one of which is ~half the size and valid for old nodes only. And guess what: the metric that counts is doubling of the number of transactions per second!
But if it makes you feel happy you can call it old blocks and new blocks or whatever. See if i care.
Good for you for staying out of rbtc. Boggles the mind where you get your misunderstandings from then.
Is there actually any possible way to scale under your definition of block size? Schnorr and SA i guess. Are old nodes allowed to learn new cryptography in your universe?

You're setting yourself up for false conclusions with convoluted definitions like that.


... because you defined it like that? Because you set the rules of this universe?
You have clearly not considered many possible attacks nor differences in short term or long term profits, nor other reasons to want to damage Bitcoin. Nor the simple fact that that "majority" you speak off is set to gain the profits of the remaining minority, for free if they just agree to kick that minority out. Sounds like a excellent deal to me.


Eh... no it's not... The fact that there are a few non-fully-validating nodes called XT/classic/unlimited running today, doesn't mean anything. They will fail at the very first sign of a block that doesn't comply with the rules they skip.
The amateurism with which these crippled versions were created in the first place: no specs, no peer reviewed design, no testing (testnet crashed because of it!), no test cases, and the manipulative lies to get people to run it, is horrendous and damaging to everyone running them, or accidentally connecting to them with their SPV wallet.

Like I said, it's been debunked and re-explained a thousand times. People are sick of the trollery and the trolls.
It's a small re-alignment of incentives. Just like Satoshi made bugs in the code, he also had some imperfections in the incentives. Everybody gets a better deal (i.a. cheaper and more transactions), but the incentive will shift from blindly increasing the UTXO set size to a balanced equal cost for growing and reducing the size.
But trolls have heard and disregarded that a thousand times already, so I don't expect any change today. In fact, they'll repeat the same lie tomorrow just because it sounds so impressive "economic change blah blah".


... to equalize the incentives of creating and destroying a UTXO.
But if you don't like the "economic change" then you just don't use segwit transacitons. You'll still enjoy the benefit of less full blocks (thus lower fees) from others using segwit, but you can just keep following your old economics. That's the beaty of a backwards compatible soft fork update. You get complete choice. Just stop trolling about it.

It would still undermine the way PoW works and make it less efficient, a safety timeout of 30s (local policy, non forced, mind you, miners are free to change that to 60s to just get that extra edge, or ignore it altogether as they gladly have before) is just a Mikey Mouse patch on a gushing wound. The whole proposal is in typical Gavin style: "ah damn I give up... I can't fundamentally solve orphan rates and decentralization pressure, so I'll put a patch on it and pretend it's gone." 
In the meantime Core is actually fixing the underlying problem (as much as physically possible) making the gushing stop and getting rid of the Mikey Mouse patch altogether.

Idiots can write pathetically bad and evil software. Yeah BU sure proved that. More news at 11.
I didn't say all soft forks are automatically good. Of course they're not.
Extension blocks don't solve the myriad of problems that SegWit does, so no extension blocks makes no sense whatsoever. Lateron, after SegWit... Maybe. I've seen some people with good arguments against them but we'll see. Clean hardfork would certainly be better. But there's plenty more scaling that will happen before we need bigger blocks again after SegWit, so no rush.

SegWit frees up space for ALL other transactions, including non-segwit transactions.
Take some fucking legos or stack of papers or toy cars or any goddamn thing: normal transactions are one size, segwit transactions are half that size. Now go see how many you can fit on a square foot or in a box or your ass for all I care.
if 100 normal transactions fit into 1 box and then you change 40 of those to segwit transactions then suddenly the box is only 80% full and you can add another 20 LARGE NORMAL OLD NON-FUCKING-SEGWIT transactions. BOOM transaction backlog just went -20.
Or 10 large ones + 20 segwit transactions.

Funny how propaganda often entails a claim of the other side doing something evil while in fact it's the propaganda side that is doing exactly what is being claimed.
I guess when you know yourself that everything you think you know is based on your own inconsistent, self contradictory and proven false propaganda concoctions being debunked daily by experts, simple logic and natural events like your nodes crashing, then the only thing you can do is attack the other side of doing propaganda, just to distract and hope your followers are retarded enough to believe it.

@_date: 2017-05-01 17:19:06


Yes it does. That's exactly the kind of doom scenarios where you do NOT want to have alternative implementations.
The blockchain's product is consensus, a temporarily stuck system (because of bug or manually halted in anticipation of a fix) does NOT break consensus and can not cause on-chain losses, so everything is fine (as fine as possible) as soon things resume (after a fix).
A system with alternative implementations where some continue and some don't or go off in different directions breaks consensus, destroying the product and causing on-chain losses to many people. And then when things resume the trouble gets even bigger because you have 2 or more incompatible and irreconcilable chains left.
Thanks for your level headed response. I will read the article. I promise to be open minded about it, but I can't really imagine changing my mind. (Not that my mind or what it thinks matters anything in this space, but whatever.)
Other things to consider:
1) Development is not centralized right now (despite what the propaganda says) and it's on a trajectory of improvement. Only the reverse can be said about Full Nodes count and Miner centralization. So dev-centralization is absolutely not a priority or concern right now.
2) It's already hard to get consensus on changes. And to an extend that's a very good thing. But that doesn't mean artificially making that process exponentially harder by introducing different code bases and teams with more NIH syndrome effects and design differences that make one team prefer different solutions than other team just because it fits better with their existing code base etc. etc.. Adding extra artificial communication and cooperation barriers, makes no sense at all. That will just lead lead to sub-optimal political compromises or complete stagnation.
Maybe once Bitcoin evolution is completely finished and we wish to add an extra immutability seal on top by making further changes impossible for even the worst future populist Gavin/Ver/Jihan/Hitler, then maybe this point becomes moot and adding extra barriers might sound good. But then the earlier reasons still remain: consensus is 100% consensus or it sucks and is worthless. 100% consensus requires 100% exactly the same code (plus some more requirements) and even if proving 100% equivalence of two code bases would be possible: it would just come back to being pointless: why go to all that trouble to just make a copy (including all the unknown bugs, voiding your argument that multiple implementations guard against bugs).
All that logic and science of redundancy and alternatives and bug-resistance and proven computing is all awesome and useful in any other domain. It's just that a blockchain really is special and it's product is this abstract thing "consensus" that is in direct contradiction with "alternatives". Maybe that's an angle to look at it: the words are simply incompatible. You can have a thousand blockchains each providing some sort of consensus on something. But consensus by definition entails one (and one only) view of the respective universe therefore anything that could possibly cause consensus to break is a failure of the system.
Building your own alternative implementation to learn from it? To prove yourself? To see if you can discover bugs that can help improve Bitcoin? Using a better language and compiler to more rapidly develop features and then port those back to C++ bitcoind? Awesome. All excellent reasons to do it. All the power to you. And my hat off to you if you even achieve just 10% of a working system or find one bug or do one proof of concept to port back. Absolutely commendable and a great addition to the whole Bitcoin ecosystem.
Marketing your implementation as a drop-in alternative and promoting people to run it and claiming running it is good for the ecosystem and makes Bitcoin safer? No. Sorry. False promises is a no go, that just immediately boils down to just another scam, of which, I'm sure you agree, we already have plenty in this space.
Sure you want some people to run your software even just for testing it and proving it's worth. But be honest and don't tell them they're making Bitcoin safer and more redundant by doing so. Tell them that when shit hits the fan they should expect to be on the losing side of a chain fork and they might not even notice until it's too late, thus they might lose money that way. To prevent that, advice them to always run your software behind a reference bitcoind full node or have them double check their data/transactions against a reference bitcoind full node and halt all their activities if those don't agree. Don't try political games where your goal is to get a majority or even significant minority of users running your software. People are free to chose what software they run, but that doesn't mean luring them in with lies and false promises is okay. BU and altcoins show that process in action perfectly.
On the other hand if your implementation has proven itself as rock solid for 10 years and everybody is convinced of its robustness and significant advantages advantages in maintainability, safe memory and pointer management and whatever else your compiler and codebase offers: the community could just decide to do a soft-fork and swap out the existing libconsensus for your libconsensus. 10% or 50% or 80% your implementation: bad. 100% your implementation: no problem. Just don't fuck with the transition from 1% to 100%.

3. It IS actually more important: fungibility is way more important. Unfortunately this will likely take a bit longer so capacity increase will be earlier.
4. This is open source: you don't get to set priorities. If you want something done quicker you go do it yourself. Other than that all devs have their own priority.

That someone being an actively evil miner trying to steal coins or disrupt SegWit or of spite. Any normal non-evil miner (old or new) will never mine an invalid block (old or new).


Temporarily. Until the evil miner lost enough money.


Only if the evil miner has enough hashing power, which is very unlikely.


It has. 


Only an evil miner deliberately attaching the network.


You already agreed to this when you bought into bitcoin. Satoshi left us with rules. SegWit adheres to those rules. It doesn't go out of the bounds set out in the original bitcoin. It uses upgrade mechanisms specifically designed and prepared by satoshi. It's backward compatible. It's optin. You can not do the upgrade and/or not use any of the new features. Satoshi gave us permissionless innovation. That means you're not in a position to deny permission to others.


That's not required anyway. Nobody is being forced to choose.
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:15:06


January called, it wants it's bullshit back. Are seriously still trying to spread that FUD trollery? You still don't understand how SegWit works?
Also, nothing you said makes SegWit not a scaling solution, so there's 1.8x scaling already.


So? Still scaling. And it enables further scaling options below.
Aggregated Signatures. Can't be bothered to look up the exact number anymore. Together with Schnorr easily 2x. Plus improved privacy and incentive for CoinJoin.


I don't there are no scripts currently that couldn't be rewritten to benefit from MAST. But even if not, is still scaling.


That's as dumb as saying Intel needn't bother optimising their opcodes as chips are going to need to get faster anyway.
A 2x improvement of space efficiency is going to be 2x forever. That means 5MB instead of 10MB blocksize. 50 instead of 100. That's what happens if you think in more than one dimension.
And like I said a HF is also in the world, so even in your one dimension there will be scaling. And we're also still ignoring LN here which has the potential to do orders of magnitude. But that's yet another dimension, that's why i left it out.

Will or will not a BU node accept &gt;1MB blocks if the user configures it so?


Then that node is not validating Bitcoin consensus rules and it (and all SPV nodes depending on it) will be fooled onto a BU chain when presented with &gt;1MB blocks. That means it will be partitioned off the Bitcoin network, meaning double spend attacks will happen.
Also, have you figured out why you forked yourself off of testnet yet? Has that been fixed yet? How dare you assholes run such untested crap on the live network?

Anyway, 1.7x is still more and faster than the non-existant imaginary HF with golden pixy dust that you've been promised.


Absolutely pathetic that you even dare bring that up. One-time is more than 0x which has so far been achieved by bigblock nutters.
Also: let's not use the B side of cassette tapes shall we, that's only a one-time improvement. Why not just use the top side of your harddisk platters? Why use zip files at all, they're just a one time file size reduction.  Are you fucking nuts?


Blah blah... did you come up with this shit yourself or did you just read some rbtc morons? Honestly, tell me. Did you give any of this one minute of thought before parrotting it?


Absolute lies.


They can take all the time they want and most of the small changes required have already been done by almost everyone.


Too bad. Laws of physics preclude golden rainbows.


They've been working on a HF implementation for at least 2 years now and still have absolutely nothing to show for except buggy untested crap code that blows up without getting noticed for more than a month. So good look even developing such a HF, let alone gettting consensus.

Bullshit. There was never ever anything well designed + implemented decently (i.e. without blatant noob level bugs,, thanks and Classic and BU incompetence I now need to add that obvious qualifier) + tested (same qualifier again) or even viable to be rolled out sooner​ than SegWit (at very least because hard forks take much longer, especially when they're not finished and tested).
And thanks for contradicting yourself, none of the unfinished bikeshed proposals of yesteryear were scaling solutions either.
In the meantime Core actually worked towards a scaling solution by making every aspect of Bitcoin many times more efficient and faster. Something that was (continues to be) a requirement for any scaling solution. But instead of appreciating that, Classic/BU/rbtc retards use it in statements to justify why a block size HF is safe, if not outright stealing credit for it. Amazing transparent dishonesty.
And you can start complaining about not finished once you have a finished solution yourself. You have absolutely nothing. Especially nothing​ remotely like a scaling solution under your own definition.

I hadn't checked the actual lines, as I know already Zander is a pretentious scammer, not worth my time.
Matt's mail further down, where he mentions: 


(I'm assuming he's talking about the same file. I'm not sure if the repeat of L138 is a typo or if there are actually two bugs in one line.)
Also be aware that Zander may have fixed some of these bug or maybe moved around some code since the email, so you might need to look at a historical version. (In that case you'd expect to see a commit with a proper comment on it, explaining this whole issue.)


It says int32, so that should fix it as 4 bytes. But looks like he doesn't check whether 4 bytes are actually available in token.data. But I only looked at that line and I'm not claiming I'm a security expert or Bitcoin dev, so it might be something elsewhere.

For me I'm very glad with all the huge performance improvements in all those areas that core has implemented over the years. 


Eh no. Actually didn't exist. And bitcoinj is actually not even as good as it could be in checking things and protecting is user. But that's because Mike Hearn refused to implement more protections because he was already planning his hard fork nonsense and he needed the leverage over blindly trusting light clients to follow his fork.
Anyway, the proofs (later called fraud proofs) satoshi talks about in the whitepaper don't exist. They turned out to be impossible. SegWit does gets us closer to realising them and SegWit certainly improves things for light clients and hardware wallets. But it's not as light and safe as satoshi hoped it would be, yet.

"Liking" and saying we "need" this or that and then pulling random numbers out of ones ass doesn't make any sense. That's exactly what all of 2015 was wasted on by Gavin and XT and Unlimited and Classic. All non-scientific arbitrary bike shedding without even determining and clearing any physical road blocks on the way.
Anyway, segwit + Schnorr + SA + MAS will get you 6x soon, then a roughly doubling HF and that's even ignoring LN. So you'll get your 10-20x soon anyway. Just done right.

We're pointing out problems. It's the rbtc crew that's handwaving away problems and pretending everything is fine and dandy if you just ignore them.
The answer is already in your own question, although your question assumes good faith. If you reverse it to assume worst case scenario (which is the right kind of question for security software), it reads:
If a super majority of nodes signal for a raise of the max blocksize of 1mb, then what?
The super majority (95%?) has the power to raise the maximum block size which will directly earn them that 5% extra income as they can push out those smaller miners.

They're already starting with NOT enabling SegWit in the fastest and safest and easiest way.

If you apply different rules to determine what's valid or not then you're by definition not running Bitcoin. Bitcoin is defined by the exact set of rules that determine what's valid or not. So, yes there is a valid.


It actually can, very much so, in a decentralised way. It's actually easier than in a centralized system. Once the market penetration of a protocol has reached enough decentralised participants, it becomes extremely hard to change anything. That's why miles and inches still exist. If the decision could be made centrally, the whole world would be on the metric system a 100 years ago.
So it's even hard to change. Which is exactly what we want: money needs to trustworthy and stable far into the future, otherwise it's pointless.

Deploying a soft or hard fork is dangerous enough, being deceitful about its properties and the trigger level is already very bad. Having no expiry date and pretending failure is not an option shows complete lack of concern for safety or reality.
Exactly what to expect with code written by incapable amateur devs.
@_date: 2016-10-21 07:36:56
One from bitcoin.org only makes sense.
XT / classic / unlimited are all failed forks by loud liars and scammers. The devs are complete jokes, having no idea what they're doing. Which leads to huge security problems. They don't even test their coffee as evidenced by then forking off of the testnet and not even noticing it until they're told a month later and still not having fix ed it another month later.
But probably their worst lies are that they oversell and overpromise on features and capabilities, raising false expectations for users and investors. Every time they launched they made a lot of noise on taking over Bitcoin and having majority support, but every time it turned out to be all lies and the support stuck at a few percent max, only to do again later.

@_date: 2016-05-17 22:07:13


This! I've long been thinking this in discussions with people. Most of whom btw don't understand the distinction between hard and soft at all, and just use the labels to arbitrarily mean whatever suits their argument and whatever some FUDster whispered into their ear. 
Both hard forks and soft forks can be evil or good. Both can be implemented to trigger at 99% or 95% or 51% or 5%. Both can be done by 1 single centralised dev, in both cases miners miners and users can be bribed, in both cases a political campaign can be launched to persuade ignorant sheep to start using the fork (as seen with classic).
That's why it's important to have a track record of well thought out changes, well tested, well peer reviewed, with consensus by many devs and the public and where applicable for example wallet devs. Only then does the change get rolled out and only after a high trigger percentage (true 95%, not a deceitful 75% that's actually more like 70% as in classic) then the change gets triggered.
Having that track record means it should be bloody fucking obvious to anyone if some populist scammer is trying to take a shortcut and roll out a change way too fast with way too low percentages. Even someone pro that change should have alarm bells going off and not go sheep mode. That's one of the protections against evil forks we need.
Notice how the above doesn't make any distinction between hard and soft. 
Soft forks are (in general) technically easier to roll out smoothly and multiple can be rolled out (i.e. up for vote) simultaneously and they generally have much less impact on wallets that don't immediately upgrade etc. But likely every now and then a HF is necessary and can also nicely clean up some kludge that soft forks sometimes make for backwards compatibility reasons.

Says who? You? Where is your peer reviewed research that proves it safe?
Also: the suggested method up doing 2MB hard fork was developed by completely incapable devs and proven riddled with bugs and security problems. It was so much untested code that testnet blew up and they didn't even notice for a month.
Even if we wanted to do this compromise you talk about, there is no code ready to run. Implementing segwit turned out to be faster than creating a hard fork "that changes one constant". If that doesn't show you the utter incompetence of bigblock devs, i don't know what will.

The topic was SegWit, not uasf.
Ok, so your argument was that miners are more scared of loss of fees to trustless off chain solutions that to trusted offchain solutions. Sounds far fetched and contradictory as well as a reason to accept any blocksize increase that will lower fees this giving people less incentive to go offchain at all: SegWit.
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:54:03
Before the halving. Lol, roll out a HF within a few weeks, while SegWit is on the curve of being rolled out. Yeah that sounds like a plan.

Nobody is that extreme. Everybody agrees in due time a well designed uncontentious hard fork might be a good thing. It's the "due time" bit that some people just don't have the patience for.
It's very clear though that no HF attempt could have rolled out faster than SW did. It would have had required at least as much work designing, peer reviewing, testing etc. as SW did (and it would have basically had to include the whole of SW anyway) and obviously hard forks need more time to come to consensus and roll out and let everybody upgrade. Easily several months to a year longer.

Interesting. How does that blockchain achieve that exactly, different than other shared databases? They definitely need some sort of locking or a mechanism to decide who's write attempt survives in case of conflict. Both of which are 70ies problems in general.
Bitcoin just adds PoW so it can do without locking, but it still has a conflict resolution in order to come to consensus in case of conflict ( "longest" chain).

Why the obsession with blocksize? What dishonest twist of reality is that? If an update was made that straight up reduced the size of all transactions by 30% are you going to complain that it doesn't increase the blocksize? (Such an update exists btw and will go in soon after SegWit).
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:31:46
MAST and Schnorr and SA are already already mostly developed. Yes, it will take some time to prepare it for Bitcoin and fully test it etc. If you want it faster you're welcome to help. In the meantime SegWit itself will provide plenty of leeway and basic engineering and science 101 says you don't change too many variables at once in a delicate system without observing its effects in detail.
But again: fake drama about urgency. If urgency was so important why is the only available and possible scaling solution being sabotaged for 1.5 years now?
"Upcoming further solutions are not good enough because they will take a few months, therefore we delay the existing solution for 1.5 years and continuously demand to hard fork tomorrow to non-existent non-solutions." Yeah right.

You said eventually.
Multisig use will go up. MAST, SA, Schnorr and more will add a lot too.


famous in your confirmation biased mind. 
Last I heard Mike is gone, but he was already far far disqualified before he left. Hardly developed anything (fact) and behaved more like an attacker than a contributor.
Gavin also hardly contributed anything for more than 3 years. All his recent ideas (2+ years) have been complete junk, as he proves by endlessly bikeshedding them. He also doesn't understand decentralization, consensus and incentives. Nor how to be cryptographically proven something.
Jeff also hardly made any contributions and he also doesn't understand decentralized consensus very well.
2 out of 3 of your famous devs have done more harm than good. At the very least they've held up and misguided development and progress for a long time. Maybe you should reconsider your stars.




Thanks to the hard work done by Core. That is NOT by your famous devs.


There's still no need. A shitload of transactions are spam or inefficient bloat. Also, raising the block size to fit more garbage does not make sense when there are ways to reduce the size of the garbage: enter segwit.


Limit has been increased. Blocks were always limited by configuration which almost all miners used or even lowered. The fact that it wasn't a hard consensus limit doesn't mean non-miners could have filled up blocks to 1MB back then.


False. You still benefit from freed up space by others if you don't. It's called backwards compatible and that's the beauty of a soft fork.


If you would just open your eyes...
1) They full of bugs, security holes and DOS vulnerabilities.
2) The designs are crap. Their whole ideas are crap.
3) They're not compatible with each other or with Bitcoin core.
4) They're untested.
5) They're no peer reviewed.
6) They have 0 consensus, nobody is using them.
7) They're not finished.
8) All of the above nicely proven by testnet blowing up and nobody noticing for a month. And now they're ripping code out that was supposed to be a stopgap to the N^2 hashing problem.


Tell that to those exchanges that lost money on the Eth hard fork.


If I ever see those alerts, it's a sign to sell everything, as that means consensus has failed and the whole Bitcoin experiment has failed.
Hard forks are extremely messy and dangerous if not completely uncontentious. 


That was regarding a segwit hard fork. We do need segwit either way, even more so than a block size increase.

They have and did. No consensus came from that proposal. Too bad. If you don't understand decentralized systems, maybe you should just fuck off.


None exists. The fixes that SegWit brings are an absolute minimum for any blocksize increase.


Impossible. Will take at least another year of design/development/testing and then much more still to get consensus and update everybody in advance. And all that turmoil will complicate all other concurrent development for all that time.


Oh, so you want to shit on the heads of 20% of the community? The community that stepped into this space being promised stability and immutability? Remind me next time and I'll make sure you're part of the 20% when the next hard fork happens.
And in case you're wondering: Soft Forks like SegWit are opt-in (no force) and backwards compatible, nobodies rights or abilities are taken away even if they're not paying attention at all.


How do you know? Just like they promised when 2MB blocks were the demand? We got them, but then the demands suddenly changed. It's impossible to even know what the demands are today because there's no bigblocker left that is willing to give a straight answer knowing they're in the wrong and in a position that will be overrun by progressing history soon anyway. Untrustworthy pigs that are only busy with scooping up money by cheating or playing powergrab games. You need to open your eyes and not assume they won't fuck everyone over yet another time after doing exactly that multiple times already.


Listen to the community and do as told and do what they're being payed for. That would be a decent start.


They didn't. They specifically set up a trap for those Core devs but didn't get what they wanted. Didn't stop them from lying about what was promised to them and milking that for every drop it's got.


There's nothing more Core can do and that's exactly how Bitcoin was intended. Core doesn't have control and can't be forced to do stupid shit.
The devs that do think they can control Bitcoin and do accept dirty money for doing stupid shit, have already publicly gone flat on their face many many times and no sane person would trust a penny to them and their code.


Miners don't even want larger blocks because that lowers fees. And sabotaging the only available solution with lies and pumping shitloads of money into anti-Bitcoin campaigns really sounds like something someone with an honest slight disagreement yet the same end goal (larger blocks) would do. Wake up already!

Only to eventually settle on a warped and fucked up and highly disruptive and dangerous method of activating the SegWit that could have rolled out safely and smoothly a year ago and would have resulted in at least 2MB blocks by now.


Sounds like you did some research to determine what "too small" means. Sounds like you have valid logical arguments that say that 1MB is impossible and 2MB will solve all problems? How come you are not citing actual research papers that show this?

@_date: 2017-07-17 23:46:21


No. That's the whole point. One implementation breaking means there's still consensus and the worst is a temporary outage or some empty blocks while things get fixed.
Two implementations where one breaks (doesn't matter which one) means no more consensus, means chain split, means never merge again, means spend and replay attacks, means people will lose money, means large reorg later on (means more losses) or eternal split, means all kinds of wars fighting over who gets hash power similar to what we're seeing now.

@_date: 2015-03-13 17:28:27
Whether it's wasteful depends on how much value the "decentralized" part provides.
It's easy to counter that the "centralized" thick fingers of bankers and politicians ruining peoples lives with wars and theft, while swimming in stolen riches, is actually more wasteful. Add to that all the security guards and military to defend those grease balls. Plus the huge buildings they operate in. Plus all the extra middlemen in the rest of the financial system. I could probably keep going for a while.
So yes, compared to a utopian world where a central database can be trusted, POW is a bit wasteful.

Exactly, so at that moment in time the network is less secure. Depends on whether attackers will be fast enough to take advantage of it, but that's a different story. Adversarial thinking says they do.


I'd argue that when hardware at a certain efficiency is available for a while, it becomes easier for more diverse and smaller parties to get access to it. The new generation is rolled out to a few lucky (larger) players that have early access and others only receive it weeks, months later. So it starts relatively centralized and then trickles down to more and more players.
If that's even remotely true, it means every new generation of hardware sort of resets that process and the small players lose out again. That's been happening for very many times for a few years now: the next cycle happening mere months after the previous.
Some big players have an advantage, small players get a kick in the butt.
"Luckily" the rate of those cycles of smaller and faster chips is slowing down (to Moores law, instead of outpacing it), so there's a chance we'll be seeing more trickling down happening, where more and more players can again start mining.
We now (with AsicBoost) have a probably one-time ever opportunity to prevent one single cycle from happening, allowing existing miners to not throw away their investments and letting the trickling continue. Instead of once again resetting the whole mining industry.
In the long run, I doubt it will matter much, but in real life terms it means postponing throwing into the garbage dumps all currently existing mining hardware to replace it with AsicBoost hardware. Keep existing hardware running for maybe a year longer.
With all previous cycles we couldn't have done anything even if we wanted, likewise for most future cycles. AsicBoost is really unique in that we have a choice. Whether we should needs some honest debate by smart people, I certainly wouldn't expect my oppinion to be worth a damn, but it's certainly interesting an interesting what-if to think about.

Another secret if Bitcoin: Satoshi isn't Jesus/God/whatever and he wasn't right about everything either.

How many coins are there in the Bitcoin system? 21M? Wrong. A varying amount. Every transaction consumers and creates coins.
How many different denominations of coins are possible? Practically infinite: anything between 21M and 1 satoshi.

It also calls a wallet a wallet while it doesn't contain any "coins" and it's really a keychain. Names in code are abstractions or analogies as well. Doesn't make it work the other way around.
Anyway, like i said people call them coins and it makes a lot of sense for people in the know, like you and me. But truth is: there are no tokens (or coins) in bitcoin that compare to tokens (or coins) in the real world where tokens are handed from one person to the next while remaining intact and of unchanged size/value/denomination.

All full blocks are 4M weight by definition. That's what it means to be full. As in 4M is the max. Hitting the limit. Can't go over 4M.
There is no legacy limit.


Pretty much 4M. Maybe an empty bock every now and then if miners still haven't fixed their act by then.


Weight stays the same: 4M. Number of transactions that fit in there goes up (additional capacity). Size in bytes goes down. Win-win.

Not if they can't detect that there's something wrong with the data their node is spitting out. And they can't know because that's the whole reason for running the node in the first place.


That sounds like it doesn't make sense at all, as that requires a whole other level of sybil-resistant consensus system on top of what we have already. That system will have its own flaws and will have to be protected by another system on top. And then another.
Sounds like consensus buzz words similar to the BU EC crap.

Blocksize doesn't exist anymore. SegWit just activated.


False. If full nodes don't enforce the soft fork rules there is an ever growing jackpot of anyone-can-spend transactions ready for the taking by miners. All i need to do is ignore your soft fork and not use those transactions.
Why do you think SegWit need economic backing before activating?


Just for the record. The so called "small blockers" just activated the one and only block size increase in existence. They were delayed by "big blockers" for a year but they did it anyway. In the meantime "big blockers"have achieved literally nothing. Not a line of code. Not even a decent idea or proposal. Despite several spectacular failures and explosions of badly disguised coup attempts. Nothing. Only delay and sabotage.

I guess theory is very important in the Bitcoin context. Details matter.


Actually Bitcoin is supposed to be much better than a democracy. Even though Satoshi's "One vote, one CPU" is often misquoted as making Bitcoin a voting system, it has actually nothing to do with democracies or voting.
One weakness of human kind that Bitcoin can't solve is that people might be swindled into shitcoins and use their wealth to "vote" in the open market by selling Bitcoins and buying some other. Of course that's not maintainable as they'd just loose their money that way and the scammers running the pumpadump-du-jour will move their profits somewhere safer (Bitcoin or fiat). So that problem should solve itself, although it could take a really long time. Note how scammers like Ver and Jihan and co are profiting from adding extra confusion and delaying Bitcoin progress directly through this mechanism.
Ok, very good.

I've pointed out multiple factual errors in your statement. It's up to you to draw your conclusions from that. At the very least, I'd say trying not to repeat the same untruths again. But it would seem to make sense to start doubting the sources of those lies and then figure out what else those lying sources are feeding you.
But hey. Some minds are just too stuck.
Good luck with your personal implementation. Should be an excellent way of learning all the details. Although if you're in the camp of "more alternatives is better because it provides redundancy and all that yadiyada" then make sure to question that meme as well, once your mind breaks loose from its dug in opinions.
PS claiming all kinds of technical merits but then not recognising and appreciating the technical excellence of people like Greg and frankly all Core devs... (And conversely recognising the sheer amateurism of proven unqualified, lying and irresponsible BU devs.) That's just a big contradiction that simply discredits those claims of yours.
Not sure if i called you unqualified or in what context. Everybody is unqualified in some contexts. Fairly irrelevant tbh. Recognising other who are and recognising fakes who claim but aren't send not your primary skill for sure.

Yes forking is always possible. That's a good thing. Getting a significant portion of people to actually run and use your software (and value its tokens) is the hard part. And that's good too.
That also means the users are also always responsible (as with any software) for running the correct software and making sure they're not being manipulated into running backdoored or otherwise manipulated software.
Now unfortunately, as has been shown in many an election, people are not always that rational and thorough. They tend to let themselves be manipulated all over the place by the me promise of unicorns. BU has also been hard at work trying to prove that phenomenon.
In the situation in my previous post i was imagining a future where bitcoin is widely used and that so many varied and decentralized populations depend on it for their wealth or income or way of life that a populist convincing one group of people to change the consensus rules will be in vain as all the other groups will just block those changes.
One attack vector that remains (of the dev group is still relatively small) in the above situation is jailing all the devs and forcing them to put tiny inconspicuous changes in the code that people overlook and then after a few years when everybody has updated the attacker strikes.
The immutability seal i meant was having more teams and implementations so that attacking 1 dev team will wouldn't help.
But tbh it doesn't make that much sense as the are probably better ways of ensuring that the consensus code doesn't change: just checking a hash for example. Or enlarging the dev team (plus code reviewers) to 1000 or 10000 (decentralized) people and having them sign off on the gitian builds.

nullc (the person you're replying to) is part of "they". Click on his name to see the epic tonnes of posts that he makes daily. They're full of facts and reason and answers to peoples questions. Unfortunately lately they're mostly debunkings of made up lies and defenses against personal attacks by the rbtc trolls. But still worth a read.
He's certainly not the only one with high quality posts, but I must admit it took me quite a while as well to figure out who's who and who's worth my time to read.


You make it sound like a it's democracy. It's very much not. Most of it is science and engineering: stuff gets invented and developed based on reasearch, data and logic. The rest is free market where people can choose to update or not to update, to use or not to use and to buy or sell. In the case of a soft fork all those three choices are freely available and even compatible with each other: if enough people don't want it, it won't get activated. If it does get activated, people can still choose not to update and be just fine with the old version. And if they do update, they're still not forced to use the new feature if they don't want. If they're really truly butthurt-upset, they can sell their coins.
A hard fork is much more dangerous and it would be nice to have some proper voting mechanism for it (not just miners: all users), but that hasn't been invented yet (and seems unlikely to be really possible). Therefore the only safe hard fork is an uncontentious one where everybody agrees and switches over to the new coin.

Through one of two methods that BU and rbtc retards have been vilifying while chanting "bad, bad, evil, evil, naughty blockstream!" with their fingers in their ears. Both methods are however beneficial and even perfectly natural (and impossible to stop even if we wanted to) consequences of how Bitcoin and fees and mining work. RBF and CPFP.
Other efficiency increasing methods include topping up an open channel before its funds are depleted (1 extra on-chain transaction, not 2 and no need to wait for confirmation if done in time). Or closing one channel and reopening a new one (with same or different counter party) also in one transaction.

Mining profit isn't smooth at all. It's mostly determined by the price. After a price rise the mining profit skyrockets and then gradually goes back towards some minimum as miners step/upgrade up their mines. And vice versa. Rinse and repeat. Overshooting in either direction.
And then a few other factors mix in, like local Yuan/USD/EUR exchange rates. Electricity prices (especially the deals miners make). ASIC manufacturing capabilities and capacities. Individual expectations and predictions of future value of Bitcoin.

That's not what SegWit actually does. There is no "witness block", just a block with transactions, just like it has always been. Yes, it does make it easier to prune away by selectively cutting away the signatures from the transactions.


They're almost identical except one is more accurate and uses the proper technical terms. Calling it separated signatures is a decent first step description, but once you're up to trolls trying to twist your words and actively misapplying your analogy to come up with FUD about how it's broken or dangerous, then you have to start using correct terms and descriptions.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:21:43
Yeah but the next clone won't because it can do with much simpler chips and firmware. You're also still limited in number of inputs and signatures and by slow signing.

Still nothing a smartly set up database wouldn't do in the 70ies (let's make it 80ies if you're talking about more than a few kilobytes). And not only databases but also journaling in numerous filesystems. Or multiple writes to a CDROM.
Yes in Bitcoin that last step is done by chance (but in such a manner that it's deterministic for all individual nodes, which is the important and special bit that Bitcoin adds). Without that a blockchain (if you can even call it a blockchain) is just meh 70ies.

Disclaimer: only from watching presentations and reading blog/Reddit posts by devs explaining it. I haven't actually looked at the code unfortunately. I could, but my lazyness keeps coming up with excuses like "too busy".
I'm also too lazy to keep notes, so i don't have any links to sources.
I think the original estimate was 1.7 to 1.9MB or so. But almost a year later an estimate that sounded well founded went in the direction of 2.1 to 2.3. I see different devs use different numbers, but they're generally around there.
One guy whose opinion I somewhat value, but also often has pretty weird reasonings and is in the bigblock camp as far as i can tell, did a calculation that came to 1.6 (about a year ago).
The fact that the number is slowly trending upwards in time makes sense as I imagine more people using multisig (and thus more signature data).
The way weight is measured in SegWit is very subtle: real simple yet very easy to misunderstand and misapply and therefore get completely wrong answers.
Then there's a chance that for a while some miners will not mine SegWit blocks at all (5% in normal BIP9 activation or maybe up to 60% after BIP148 activation). But they'll soon realize there missing out on fees and start complying within months.
100% user adoption of SegWit might take a bit longer, but it will probably quickly jump to 60 to 90% quickly as wallet updates roll out and exchanges start using it. Although a dropping fee (as has already happened) might show that down because there's less incentive. But that's what you get when you give people choices and in many ways is a good thing as it dampens the extremes (high and low) in the fee market.
And one last thing that makes all these estimates tricky is that there might be a feedback loop where because SegWit activates people start using multisig transactions more. Today: "multisig twice as expensive.. nah never mind". With SegWit: "multisig 1.25x expensive yet still cheaper than without SegWit... Yeah maybe I'll give that a try.". This effect skews the result towards larger block sizes but at the same time it doesn't mean that 3MB blocks contain 3x more transactions than a 1MB non-segwit block. It's actually quite pointless to talk about MB's where the metric should be number of transactions. But there are other reasons why that metric is flawed even worse, so i guess MB is a reasonable unit for now.
TL;DR optimistic personal guesses with track record of being always wrong: 2MB after 6 months. 2.3 after a year.
Note how future updates like Schnorr and Signature Aggregation and MAST are actually going to reduce the resulting block size again (while increasing the number of transactions per block, i.e. win-win, but don't tell the big block crowd).

Ever since I put both BitTorrent and Bitcoin in one though, I've been very much undecided on whether this is good or bad for BitTorrent. 
On the one hand it might destroy torrent sharing as everything becomes money driven and seeders start DOSsing each other or doing nasty tricks with making certain blocks rare to drive up the price. 
On the other hand, it's simply impossible to stop once Bitcoin/LN take off. There's no point in complaining. If it makes sense (or makes some people money) it will happen. And maybe it will actually be very good, opening up new ways of sharing/distributing "legal" data too.
Please make sure to think about all the incentives at play in as much detail as the LN devs did for LN, aligning things for a fair market and keeping things distributed.

But they don't? RBF works fine.


Expiring can't be done because it's impossible to get consensus on what transactions expire and which don't. You'd need a whole extra blockchain just to keep track and get consensus on that. The problem needs to be tackled from other angles: better fee estimation to prevent it and RBF / CPFP to fix it. I also expect a good reduction once small payments move to LN.


Thanks for being open minded. That's the right attitude.

Not if blocks found through AsicBoost are defined as invalid, then there's no change in security nor efficiency.
In fact, look at it from the other side: the day an optimization like AsicBoost is invented, the security of the whole network is immediately reduced, as you have to assume that any adversary would use that new technology, but the existing miners don't yet.
There are two things that can happen after that: 
1) all miner gradually upgrade to new hardware that includes the optimization, slowly closing that gap. This costs a lot of money and eventually obsoletes all existing hardware (this is what has always happened so far).
2) Or we "simply" change the rules a little to invalidate the new optimization. Meaning the network is just as secure as it was before (effective immediately), but without having to wait for and spend all those $millions to replace all the hardware.
And I think it's reasonable to assume that (overal) it's easier for large mining operations to upgrade than it is for a small home miner, so AsicBoost (or any such optimization) is actually a centralizing force on its own.
does that make sense? Thx

To start with, you're quoting him out of context:


A miner is in it for the short-term money and therefore he doesn't trust the miner. That's exactly as Satoshi intended it mind you. Satoshi knew the incentive he gave miners wouldn't be enough to make them fully trustworthy.
Next: regardless of whether miners are being good members of the community for long-term success of bitcoin or only short-term money-grabbers: we currently have a situation where one miner is actively exploiting a vulnerability in the PoW algorithm as well as ruining even the assumption Satoshi built Bitcoin on top of by making mining completely centralized. In case you don't know how assumptions work: a broken assumption means *everything* on top of it is invalid and void and pointless and worthless.
It's up to the rest of the community to fix this vulnerability and fight against the centralization pressures to make sure Satoshi's assumption holds. That means at the very least NOT give more power and leadership roles to the money-grabber who caused this mess in the first place.

Again you're trying to compare apples to oranges.
"1MB current version" compared to "enhanced, more efficient, version with typical sizes of ~2.3MB and up to near 4MB in a weird contrived situation where a miner attacks the network at significant cost to himself". And if that 4MB attack does happen, we'll all know who to blame and it can easily be fixed punishing the attacking miner further. That's no worse a situation than where a miner deliberately mines only empty blocks or fills up blocks with spam transactions. Both of which are happening today.


He did, Twice. More than asked for. Even though the miners had already invalidated the whole agreement the day after it was made. And on top of that it's a completely irrelevant argument in any case because this is a decentralized system and Luke cannot promise anything and cannot decide for anyone else, let alone Core or the community, what to implement or run.

Locktime still applies there too.
ah.... I think I see you were talking about the reverse: protecting the coins on the non-segwit chain by using locktime. But then those coins are also locked on the segwit-chain. If that's ok, yeah that's fine: non-segwit miners will have to create a lot of blocks and wait out the locktime before they can start stealing money. So that's 
So that's a way to require miners to really stick to their attack for long term and invest in it and potentially lose a lot. It's not like they can mine the bad chain for a few days, cash out some money at an exchange and then switch to the segwit chain while the non-segwit chain dies.
Good point.

No not after the blocking of SegWit and general sabotage, delays  and general waste of time caused by bad actors. But i have news for you: 2019 is another year away.


Oh yeah, the old "the sky is going to fall from high fees, but any solution that improves things is bad because nobody will use bitcoin anymore because blocks will be full because of all the people willing to pay those high fees and unwilling to update their software to reduce their fees". So funny. I laugh so hard at people like you.


False. But you knew that because you didn't provide anything. And even if it were true, then who other than Core do we have to thank for the thankless hard job of improving and optimizing (while being pissed on by the likes of you) over the last 8 years?
In fact, who are the devs who have created the only properly designed, per reviewed, tested and working piece of code that oversees the block size, in existence? Where others have only produced talk, false promises, dismissals of problems and vulnerable buggy code. Yet you support the snake oil men and full blown scammers instead of the actual workers.


Funny coming from the one who's been stalling bigger blocks for a year now. Core is not the one stalling, kiddo. You might wake up to that one day.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:37:09


That's why they will, yet again, give in last minute. It's all about delaying the inevitable as long as possible, to milk ASICboost for as long as possible. Unless he thinks he has reached critical mass and can complete hostile takeover. I'm not sure what he thinks he will own then, cause an empty empire seems quite lonely to me, but whatever. Power Corrupted individuals usually go over the edge in the end.


Duh. Don't be so fucking pathetic believing his lies. He put it into the hardware years ago and has been mining suspicious blocks littered with the tell tale signs of ASICboost ever since.
First you are defending this:




And then you turn around and suddenly he's a boy scout that will throw away 30% of income (+ growing market share as others go out of business) just because he's such a good guy.
Seriously. Piss the fuck off.


Sure, what's 2 more weeks on 3 years of delay and sabotage?
How many of these pivotal historic moments do you need to finally come to realize you've been buttfucked for 3 years?


Only the abstract "miners in general". Not any of the individuals or companies. They can come and go or do whatever they want. Bitcoin offers a hefty reward every 10 minutes, there will always be someone to collect that reward.
But that reward is ideally intended for the miner that delivers the best decentralized PoW. The less decentralized that PoW is, the less valuable it is to the payers of that money. Unfortunately there is no feedback in the system that distinguishes centralized from decentralized PoW, thus we can't directly reward one and punish the other. But you can be sure as hell that it will have an effect on the price of bitcoin: a centralized inefficient money system is worthless as better alternatives already exist (Paypal etc.).


Took the words out of my mouth there. So you say they can't change the rules. But when they do attempt to do just exactly that, then you just follow along and make excuses for them?


That 95% was a courtesy extended to them to help smooth things out and prevent wasting invalid blocks like what happened a few years ago in another soft fork update where miners signaled they were ready but they lied. Yes, that 95% was a big mistake, it should have just rolled out. Even with 30% it would have been fine. Make an extra effort as a nice gesture to help out others and it gets abused and raped and stuck up your own ass in response.
Note how creating as much confusion as possible around the whole update will cause some miners to be on the wrong chain and lose income. And guess where that lost income will flow towards? Perhaps, the big centralized miner that took full, up to the very last minute, controlling power over the decision of what will get activated?
That's just one of the problems with a centralized miner: every single shitty thing he does, will end up rewarding him and punish other miners. The exact death spiral Core has been warning for since forever and that was set in motion even before ASICboost came along.


That's just one of the bullshit excuses that you again so gullibly swallow.
Another excude is that they don't want a fee drop. What causes a drop in fee more, a sudden overcapacity of block space causing nobody to pay any fee at all anymore. Or a steady gradual increase in size driven by and in balance with the actual fee? High fee: more reason to start using SegWit. Low fee: nah, you can just wait a little.
In fact. How the FUCK can you not see how "wanting an instant block size increase" and "sabotaging the only possible block size increase in existence for 9 months" as the biggest of all hypocritical bullshit? Seriously!? You seriously think that significant uptake of SegWit would have taken more than 9 months? And that that somehow justifies completely blocking it, while there is no alternative even thinkable that can roll out in less than 2 years? Or that imagining SegWit not being used fully and blocks being only 1.9MB after 9 months is somehow a justification for just sticking with 1MB blocks for all that time because that's somehow better? 100 Kbyte shy of the arbitrary magic number is somehow a reason to not take the 900Kbyte at all? How fucking warped is your view on reality to be making up excuses for these shallow and contradictory lies and manipulation?
Oh but no... now that push comes to shove, oh no, now suddenly we will activate SegWit (in 2x) because now all of a sudden dropping the fees to zero instantly is fine. Thank you very much for the 9 months of record high fees that could have been steady or slowly decreasing had SegWit been activated, but now all of a sudden we'll activate it for you. Sure, it's coincidentally 2 days before the economic majority would have started rejecting our sabotage blocks anyway, but that has nothing to do with it. Boy scout promise. Just give me the trigger and I'll keep my finger on it and let you know at the last minute, if I really don't see any other weasel option left.

Yeah mumble jumble with some buzzwords. That's why i called you out on it.


Stop playing false bullshit semantics. SegWit makes blocks bigger. Signatures aren't even segregated, they're just right there. In the transactions, in the blocks. 
By your bullshit reasoning even a non-SegWit 2 MB block would be 1 MB because old nodes will never ever get to see them.
Stop the lying. Stop the blocking off scaling.

I have a secret hope in the back of my mind that one day, Bitcoin (the coins) will be so well spread around to all humans, in all countries that it's very hard to imagine some attacker able to gather enough % to do a successful nothing-at-stake (or other PoS specific) attack. Maybe then we can start thinking about slowly adding PoS like contructs to (partially) replace the PoW "waste" of energy. That seems to me to be the only way around the valid arguments against PoS. But that's just me, I can't say I've heard others talking like this and it might be totally wrong.
Either way, the whole XT/Classic/BU/Johan debacle proves to me that it's very dangerous to move security from math towards gullible humans and populist politics. So this seems like a pretty long term idea to me.
Anyway, words like PoS coming from a proven liar like Jihan cannot be taken literally and some hidden agenda will need to be considered. Especially considering that PoS is very very counter to all incentives that miners have, as it can only reduce their rewards and power. The timing suggests that it's just a distraction from valid criticism and proofs of his lying coming his way.

What they have is no load and no decentralization, so their fees are a lot lower. The pumpers haven't understood though that they also have much worse scaling, so they'll run into problems much much sooner than bitcoin did. But of course they don't care, the pumpers will have already profited by then.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:38:19
You got that backwards. Alternative implementations break anti-fragility. Consensus is an all or nothing thing, in case of problems the only way to maintain consensus is if ALL nodes stop working (a frozen chain in consensus is still consensus). Anything other than that is a failure mode that leads to out of consensus split chains. Which is very bad.

@_date: 2016-10-13 21:56:10
Last I heard the better estimate was 0.8, but even that is just an estimate because it depends on the type of transactions. If multi-sig picks up (Lightning uses multi-sig) it will become more. But anyway, that's just a stupid way to look at it (in fact the whole block size debate is this stupid). The correct metric to look at is the number of transactions per second or per block or whatever.
SW will increase the transaction throughput, but it will also lower the impact multisig transactions have on that throughput: Without segwit if all transactions would be multisig, the throughput would halve. With segwit, no longer. So that's another dimension of scaling.
SegWit also allows certain use cases that currently need workarounds (sending wasteful transactions) to be eliminated. For example exchanges often need to break up their coins, otherwise they don't have enough outputs to send to customers (as sending unconfirmed outputs is dangerous with malleability).

He didn't. He only fixed a blatantly obvious huge problem (in a shitty way no less) that everyone warned about since forever, AFTER first ignoring it and proclaiming the 2MB bump was just fine.
He did absolutely nothing to deal with centralisation and still hasn't. Core has and is continuing to do so.
So basically he put up some smoke and mirrors to detract people from the actual problem and said "trust me, all is fine". And you fell for it.
And BTW he said exactly the same thing a year earlier about going to 20MB+automatic exponentially growing. "Trust me, I've tested it all, is fine". He's incompetent and lying to hide it. If not worse.

There's no way Ver+Jihan+Jeff can come out of this owning Bitcoin.

Volume still depends on other technical improvements anyway. Like upcoming SegWit + Schnorr + SA + MAST will be 2 to 3 doublings. Would those be extra? Would they have to be not done because they'd interfere with the pre planned growth plans? Would those plans be adjusted to compensate?
And what point would a preplanned strategy have anyway? Be predicable to investors so they know what to expect? So they don't run any risk? We need to hold their hands as well?
Except it won't be predictable anyway because of unforeseen technical innovations and changes in the speed of Moore's Law.
Even beside the fact that such capacity planning so far ahead is bound to be suboptimal if not disastrous anyway.

First approximation: exactly double. But the instant doubling will wreck the fee market taking away all incentives for people to start using the more efficient and cheaper segwit transactions (or LN).  At the very least this will cause those sizes to be reached later.
On the other hand the fee drop will also cause a rise in spam transactions as well as an influx of noobs with impossible use cases that will be disgruntled again 2 years later when the fee starts riding again, crying they were promised eternally free block size.

@_date: 2017-07-05 21:30:48
Can't be worse than your understanding.
The fact that extension blocks (if ever rolled out) could use a trick similar to what SegWit does, does NOT make SegWit an extension block. 


No it doesn't.


Bull. Nonsense description without meaning.


No it doesn't.


No it doesn't.


Sounds like a word you pulled out your rear, cause it means nothing in SegWit or Bitcoin. I bet you're also thinking there is a "base size" and a "base block size limit" ?


Very good. That puts you ahead of half of the rbtc trolls.
Note how "blocksize increase" (one block grows bigger) already contradicts "extension block" (separate extra block, outside the original block).


Extra blocks now? No, it doesn't. (Again, not how you're contradicting yourself and proving my point.)
Hint: a block is a bunch of transactions bundled together into a merkle tree plus a header. Transactions contain signature data and non-signature data.
Before segwit: exactly that.
After segwit: exactly that.
A non segwit node asking a segwit node to send it a block? It will get a differently serialized block where all the segwit data is cut away. Done on the spot, right there and then. Like creating a web page version suitable for Internet Explorer 3.0 which doesn't understand HTML5, so you send it some basic HTML. The user won't see the fancy new web site version, but at least it still works and doesn't explode.
And now you're going to play semantics and say "see that's a different block, blah blah", which forces you into the paradox where no update will ever be possible anymore. Which you will then handwave away once the subject changes to a hard fork where it suddenly suits your narrative to have a new version (and coincidentally completely incompatible block formats).
You should go look up how backwards-compatibility in software generally works: some wrapper or translation layer or proxy server in the new version emulating the format/language of the old versions so old versions don't crash and burn on the new file format/data packet or whatever the context is.
And you might want to compare that to how a hard fork works and figure out how an old version node will ask a new-version node for a new block.

It's not the act of writing an alternative implementation that breaks bitcoin. That even has a lot of positive side effects. For example, it's a great way for the developer to learn to an extreme detail how Bitcoin internals work. 
Yes, Bitcoin is open source and everybody is free to create his own version. That's how we've ended up with thousands of shitcoins. As well as a few alternative implementations already. And no that on itself does not Bitcoin, nor makes Bitcoin less anti-fragile.
It's the act of people running alternative clients that nibbles at the consistency and security of Bitcoin as a whole. Doubly so when that is done for political reasons.
Bitcoin is what emerges from all users together but independently running the same Bitcoin client.
Running an alternative client that will potentially one day be out of consensus and fork off or disappear, means that whatever emerges out of that mix of Core client + alternative client is NOT as strong as a network of 100% Bitcoin clients would be.
Not just at the moment that the alternative client shits its pants. Just the potential of a consensus problem already affects the usefulness and price of Bitcoin, as the market factors in the risk.

Control over something is not something defined in software. The state can only try to set up incentives possible. It can't prevent brainwashed idiots from following some scammer.
Yes a hostile takeover can happen. Although that will just result in a failure of the whole bitcoin experiment and bitcoin will cease to exist.

Same lie as before. I thought you were getting over it, but I guess not.


Hardly. But fact is everything is at least a year away from implementation and anything increasing the block size without fixing all the problems that SegWit fixes will never reach consensus anyway.
SegWit on the other hand opens up another doubling through various efficiency gains, as well as more effective pruning. And then I'm not even counting the 10x, 100x, 1000x or more that LN will bring.

This is still nonsense though:


nullc explains nicely in this thread somewhere.
Bottom line is that expiry is irrelevant anyway for what you want with it or think it does. Transactions can't timeout and there are nodes that keep rebroadcasting old transactions as long as they're still valid.
In general: whenever something in bitcoin sounds weird and unintuitive to you, you can bet your ass that some smart people have already thought about it and there is likely a very good reason for it being that way. Maybe it's just better that way in ways you haven't thought of or maybe it's an unfortunate bad thing that may or may not be possible to be fixed someday.

You're free to take it elsewhere. It's mine too and mine stays in as long as Bitcoin is either SegWit or status quo.


It doesn't. The vast majority wants SegWit. The second largest group wants status quo. Luckily SegWit is backwards compatible and opt-in, so even most status quo people aren't too upset.


Eh... no. Far from it. I oppose any Hard Fork for the foreseeable future. Not a single HF proposal has ever surfaced that would stand even a remote chance. Maybe the one mentioned in the Core road map, but that's it.

@_date: 2017-07-12 23:51:32


No. Nothing changes.


It's not the legacy node that ignores anything.
Legacy nodes ask for a block and the other node recognizes that it is dealing with a legacy node, so it will send a block that is serialized such that SegWit data is skipped and what remains is a legacy block indistinguishably valid as any other.






Indeed. Confusion around this and many such simple details keeps getting injected over and over by the propaganda team. 


Not "equivalent of xxMB." That's exactly how big those blocks will be. SegWit doesn't change transaction size (except 1byte).


There's no base size. There's weight, which will be 4M for a block (no matter what size). That size will be 2.something MB, pick whatever prediction/calculation you prefer, 10% more or less is inconsequential anyway. Size as seen by legacy nodes is irrelevant. It will be (talking about full blocks only here)  1MB (0% SegWit usage) or a bit smaller (not in the mood to do the math atm, i wanna say ~800KB, but might be totally wrong). Anyway, the only thing that counts is the number of transactions in there, which will be a lot higher with decent SegWit usage.
This is where the word equivalent comes in: that 800KB would be equivalent (contain same number of transactions) as a 2.3MB block (without SegWit).
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:56:51
Completely incorrect.
There's no such so distinction between segwit transactions and non-SegWit transactions. It's about the bytes inside the transactions that are counted differently.


Weight is not in bytes.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:44:32

Anyway core has the credit that bitcoin even still exists by doing extraordinary work for the last few years that allow bitcoin to even scale to 1MB and ready it for more. As well as for fending off hostile fork attempts out to actively destroy bitcoin.
Classic is still at 0 credit in any case, if we don't allow for deductions for bad things.
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:30:10


All of them, only with care. Which means choosing the right option and the right path, with good preparation (some propagation speed optimisation first), good coding, good testing, good peer review. And then when enough users are ready (true 95% activation, instead of deceitful 75% that can actually trigger as low as 70%) and enough time for wallets and users to switch.
And WTF are you whining here anyway if you say everyone agrees to increase and one is currently in the very last stages of development and about to go live? You want magic? You want a hard fork between now and next week? WTF are you even doing here but wasting people's time?
@_date: 2016-05-18 20:47:45
Could probably set up a new empty channel and send the required amount there through LN and then close that channel immediately. Setting up an empty channel seems to be possible trustlessly to me, no money to lose anyway and no need to wait for confirmations either.

BIP148 and community totally fed up with their bullshit made them roll out a hasted, dangerous and buggy bullshit convoluted activation scheme where jihan would have up to the last minute personal control (one individual full control! Are you insane?) over activation and timing. Not signal SegWit... No no... Signal intent to signal SegWit and let the one guy make the all our nothing decision. Are you fucking insane?
Yeah. Jihan played the game of chicken for as long as he could stretch it, keeping ASICboost ticking and adding a nice market manipulation bonus on top of it. Plus some more FUD material for the coming 3 months. As a Bond villain he played very well and hadn't been eaten by his own sharks. Yet.
Thanks to sheep and apologists like yourself he can continue for another while.


Duh. They couldn't thanks to BIP148. August 1. It did Friday the unavoidable down fall of Ver, Gavin and Jeff and the other puppets still useful for Jihan.
In the meantime he will continue to mine non-segwit empty, hence ASICboost blocks? "Oh dear we as miners want bigger blocks, really honestly! Oh and here's an empty, not 2.3MB one for you."

Dude. I already anticipated and corrected you on this in my prev post.
You're helping spread false narratives, whether you mean them as negative or not, rbtc trolls surely use it as negative arguments against SegWit and to confuse newbies. Personally i couldn't care less what you think or how you define "block" or what description makes it easier to understand and explain. And without the negative misuse and FUD by anti-bitcoiners it wouldn't matter at all but the bottom line is that it's simply not how it works. SegWit was implemented smarter and simpler than that.
1MB limit is gone.
4M weight limit.
Blocks still bunch of full transactions including witnesses. In practice blocks are often much bigger than 1MB.
Light nodes (a new class that currently doesn't exist yet) may request a block-minus-witnesses, but that's not a full block it's a stripped block, so in no way can you claim that is the definition of a block.
And then there is the situation where an old node requests a block from a SegWit node. At that moment the SegWit node again sends a stripped version (not sure if it's the same as above, no reason it has to be). Even at this moment there is no need to check for 1MB because the 4M weight limit together with the definition of what weight means already makes it impossible to be larger than 1MB. The old node accepts it and for practical purposes considers it a full block, even though it already knows there are features it is unaware of. The old node has even warned its user about that fact.
So even if you want to warp reality and logic by defining what a block is by only considering old nodes (which makes any HF block size change also not a block size change) then still you're missing the point that old nodes are actually aware of the fact that they're not really full nodes anymore because they know there are rules they're not aware of. They just don't know what those rules are or how much they're missing.

Old nodes will never see 2MB Hard Forks blocks (at all). What's your point? 


Nope. SegWit blocks = just a bunch of transactions piled into a block (like ever before), covered by some hashes in a merkle tree (like ever before) + another new commitment hash for the signatures.

They came up with a way to give others (your friends, your mom, or specific third parties offering this service) a guard transaction that they can independently send to the blockchain as soon as they detect a malicious closing attempt (without any interaction with you and without being able to steal the money or even know what they are looking at). Those third parties learn nothing (no loss of privacy) about the channel or its use at all if no malicious close ever happens. Only when the malicious close attempt happens do they learn a channel actually existed in the first place and they can connect it's opening and closing transactions to you, just like any transaction on the blockchain (if they know who you are, which they don't if you use Tor). Also: a malicious closing attempt is punished by a loss of ALL money contained in the channel, giving it to the victim. So an attacker will certainly give up after a few failed attempts.
That doesn't take away from the fact that to really use Bitcoin you simply should always run a full node. That's the whole idea behind Bitcoin: don't trust, but independent verification. This is just as valid for off-chain transactions as for on chain transactions. Although on LN the risks are mitigated by the much lower values are much lower. Slight risk of losing $10 might not be enough reason for you to run a full node 24/7.
Your question is just, but it has been thought of and has been solved by the LN experts.

SegWit + Schnorr + AS + MAST is like 6x scaling as a mere side effect of other massive performance and privacy advantages. And mostly without raising the blocksize at all, so avoiding any downsides in that area. All that without even counting LN and the HF.

That's a troll in my book. Especially since this is a repeat occurrence.


Except your holy Satoshi DID make mistakes and several of those incentives have been FIXED over years. And another is in the process of being fixed by SegWit.

Why did you not answer his bold letters "valid" instead of whining over a few percent?
If you don't like SW, nobody will force you to use it. You can keep using your old version. If you feel uncomfortable that your node is not checking all signatures, you simply upgrade to a version that has read-only SW capabilities: it only verifies but never uses SW. 
Anyway, that "valid". Valid is the most important word in that sentence. You just conveniently left it off and again arrived at an upside down conclusion.

I do wonder where you got that, as that's completely untrue.


And again you're in luck, as even that is not necessary. Although virtually it does come down to coins moving, splitting and re-combining, there is no need to name or serial number them.
Because the next secret of Bitcoin is that coins don't exist either.
When you create a new transaction, all you do is point to one or more output of previous transactions (not to "coins" and not to "balances") and then come up with new outputs that can be used as inputs of future transactions.
You could call one output "one coin" (of a certain denomination, that's the closest you'll get to coins/tokens in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-07-05 21:53:59
Then you weren't paying attention. It was full of stuff that was badly though out and all criticism was ignored and downplayed and aggressively attacked, but after a few months (sometimes after DOS attacks proved that indeed it was badly designed code with no thought put into adversarial thinking) whole swaths of codes would be silently deleted again.


Only maybe if Core had had double the man power and not constant petty attacks from trolls spawned by Gavin and Ver and Jihan, sabotaging their valuable time. But even then, significantly bigger blocks seem unlikely as it simply doesn't make sense.


And again you betray your gullibility to lies and how deeply you've been brainwashed.
SegWit as HF is bull shit. It's not simpler. It's literally a few lines of code difference. It takes at least a year longer to roll out (ignoring the sabotage). And it's actually *worse* because it makes the header unnecessarily larger. Headers that light weight nodes have to download, wasting their bandwidth and battery life for no reason.


Yeah maybe, in that ideal world where there is not time wasting sabotage and more capable dev man hours available. But you know what: that's already on the current (not ideal world) Core road map anyway. Tell Ver and Johan and Gavin to stop the bullshit. Close down bitcoin.cum and rbtc and you'll probably shave off at least half a year towards that upcoming hard fork. Had you done that 3 years ago, we might already be looking at a HF today and SegWit running for more than a year already.


They are that today, in this highly non-ideal world, where chimps are flinging poop while Einsteins are trying to get work done.


Not necessary, but nice to have. Certainly be nice if they could have been trusted with the little bit of extra responsibility they were giving in BIP9 to help them coordinate the SegWit roll out smoothly. They surely fucked that up hard.


They certainly have. Too bad Ver discovered the viable strategy of luring in the endless gullible suckers with false promises of free transactions and limitless blocks and get rich quick. And once hard physical reality hits home, shift the blame on Core. The tried and tested method of a politician exploiting gullibility by promising jobs and tax cuts and wealth, but when things turn a little bad just blame some other (successful) subsection of the population to crucify/burn-at-stake/hang/imprison/banish/eliminate/genocide.

4M not 4MB
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:20:30


You might be confusing yourself due to some inaccuracies in your wording. SegWit has a weight limit of 4M. Weight is not in bytes. There is no unit there. The 1MB limit is gone.
Weight is calculated as (sig bytes + 4 * nonsig bytes). (Hope I'm saying that right, please double check before trusting it exactly. But the general idea is there.)
That implies strictly max 4MB blocks and max 1MB for old fashioned blocks. Latest average effective size I've heard is 2.3MB but we'll have to see how things turn out exactly. Either way those are implied byte sizes emerging from the weight limit. A full block will always have 4M weight, no matter its size. Weight better represents the cost of the data to the network as a whole.

@_date: 2017-07-18 18:59:07
If I throw more money on the table in transaction fees than Bitcoin does, then most miners will flock to my chain. Chinacoin is by definition worthless, so they can't afford to throw money to fees, so miners can't be sustained.


It actually does, because Bitcoin ceases to exist once it's centralized. Simply gone. Experiment over. Worthless. Everybody can go home and back to using the much more efficient PayPal and VISA.






Momentary random numbers like that are meaningless. 
It's about the value of the block rewards + fees that miners can collect. Economic activity and community and dev brain power behind and price of coin are much bigger factors than "15% hashing power". 85% of miners fighting over some fee crumbs of a worthless coin is not going to last more than a day, when they can swim in riches mining the real chain with hardly any competition.
You're also overestimating the dangers of 51% attacks. It's not that bad and there are counter measures possible (that make the attack *very* expensive and risky). Also doing such an attack would leave their own chain with hardly any mining power with the oh so devastating block times (and vulnerable to attack themselves).

Of course there are many other (centralisation) pressures. That doesn't mean you give up fixing one because "we're doomed anyway". Most of the pressures so far seem to be either in check or could be brought into check. Including the ones you mention.
Yet the ones you mention are not influenced by (or otherwise related to) the topic at hand, which is AsicBoost. So we can have a choice here. A choice that definitely has pros and cons. A choice that needs to be debated thoroughly.

Please stop giving credence to this quackery with numbers.
Market cap is already an irrelevant number if its constituents (price and supply) aren't free of manipulation. Even in Bitcoin the price is not without manipulation, but in all shitcoins both price and coin supply are highly manipulated (premines etc.). 
Comparing one manipulated number to the sum total of hundreds of highly doubly manipulated numbers is just facesmackingly dumb or manipulative.
And then market cap doesn't even mean what most people assume anyway. It's completely pointless.

This seems like an awesome idea!
1) This is a cool counter-part to  (receiving blockchain through DVB) to get the occasional transaction back onto the network.
2) This could be a new way for mobile operators to offer their service: no subscription and no prepaid SIM: actually, no SIM at all. Instead your phone simply shouts out a transaction+privatekey (one way broadcast, no confirmations required, you don't need to be "connected" to a cell tower at all) and all listening operators race to relay your transaction. Perfect solution for with the future self-driving, self-owning cars.
3) If any application is thought of that gets a little bit of traction, then it becomes fairly easy for have every Wifi (and Bluetooth) access point and phone scan for such broadcasts.

@_date: 2017-07-26 00:31:13
Indeed. But i expect a lot of people to want to race to dump before the price crashes. That was my initial thought. But now I'm thinking: that might be what Ver and co want: they'll allow a huge dip initially so they can buy very cheap and once most people have sold they artificially raise the price again so they basically end up owning a coin with the same name and price as Bitcoin that they can sell to confused noobs through bitcoin.com etc.
Maybe that's their scam angle. In that case i should wait selling and only sell when they're pumping. That way i get as much $ straight from Ver's pockets.
But maybe I'm wrong and this won't be their primary scam. The Replay scam sounded more plausible at first, although Peter Todd is bouw tweeting they'll actually have proper replay protection.

it is somewhat of a hybrid fork, somewhere between soft fork and hard fork.
If you know you're talking shit, make up some new definitions.
SW8x is a Hard Fork. Period. It's clearly impossible to apply the word Soft Fork to it, no matter how much you bend reality. Duping SPV nodes with invalid blocks is never okay, no matter what bullshit you come up with.


auto-accept new rules, but many wallets, notably SPV wallets, will.
Worst of both worlds: nodes that have no way of knowing are duped and those that can't be forced against their will anyway won't be.

Completely false and dumb lie. Yours or brainwashed into you. Do you even think before you say something this stupid? You think a hard fork magically forces all wallets and payment processors to update? Why would they be any faster than with a SF? Or are you suggesting the new version is going to make old transactions illegal too?
Practically ALL wallets were ready for SegWit at launch. Uptake would have been fine.
Instant increase is actually bad, not good: it destroys the fee market and invites all the spam back.
Hard Fork means forcing people to do thing that you clearly think they don't want (update). Why do you want to play dictator and force people to do things?
Are you afraid that a slow uptake will prove that all the whining about the sky falling and fees being too high and doom this and that were all utter bullshit? Don't worry, that has already been proven anyway.

So you handwave away downsides with a magic market. Market feedback means that it does happen and the market reacts to that.
Alternative clients are also completely pointless: either they are 100.0000% exactly the same in which case there's no reason to switch. Or they are not and then they are guaranteed to at some point lose consensus and thus lose anti-fragility.
The correct way to do alternative clients is what Core is working on: libconsensus that contains all the consensus critical code and then many teams can build their own nodes or wallets or fancy whatevers all using the same libconsensus library.

It sounds like that means donations WITHIN this app. If you create a new empty app called "Mycelium-Donation" and only link to that app from your description and about box. I've seen several apps do that.
Some apps also have ads, which disappear as soon as you install a seperate paid dummy-app that only contains some license file or whatever.
So basically this way Google won't see it as a donation (therefore no need to be a charity either) but simply as a paid app and Google won't care that the second app doesn't actually do anything at all. Maybe make sure you're very flexible with chargebacks so people don't start complaining about that second app doing nothing useful.

You're making judgement calls again, based on normal software context which doesn't apply to bitcoin.


It is actually. Because it's a single common defense against potential adversaries. If an adversary can trigger different behaviour in different clients, that partitions the defense making it exponentially weaker. This is literally standing together to be strong. Be one big hurd.


Code is law. That mistake is part of the spec. If the community decides that is a fatal mistake, the blockchain needs to freeze and a soft or likely hard fork must be done to fix the mistake. Having different clients running off in different directions only complicates things.


That's a matter of independent checks and balances. Everybody can raise concerns and of true concerns (not the fake shit rbtc throws around) aren't properly dealt with people won't update anymore.


Don't repeat lies. That's absolutely false.


It's not a single repo. Git is distributed. And those are actually arguments for one client: more critical eyes peer reviewing, and checking commits and builds.


Maybe so, but there's no other way. Hence all the usual arguments don't apply and hence the counter intuitive implications.
The path forward is distilling out the consensus code into libconsensus which all implementations can use. Maybe libconsensus can be morphed into some VM code and/or more abstract language that makes mathematical proofs easier. Then alternative clients can run that internally and you can maybe run it through a compiler to generate a pdf and that'll be your human readable spec.

Speed is of the essence. Too bad it's the actual scammers who are the ones with the finger on the trigger: the ultimate for of insider trader information is when you can time and trigger the event yourself. They also have nice access to fresh coins (after 100 blocks) that can be used to untangle their existing coins ready for dumping on the other chain. Unless they pick the wrong chain, they'll have a big head start on everybody else. Possibly enough to double spend attack some exchanges while they're at it.
Now the big question remains: which chain are they actually going to dump? They also have insider information on how impossibly-unlikely segwit8x is ever to succeed and how hopelessly retarded their own devs are.

Well, it works for other stuff too, but what you probably mean is that it only works for situations where gross price manipulation is impossible. Where impossible means either "too big for anyone to have a big impact (even whales)" or "the illegal, end up in jail". 
Bitcoin is growing, but still not big enough for the first kind of impossible (all other shitcoins are pathetically small where market cap means absolutely nothing).
The second kind of impossible has so far been completely absent from the entire crypto space. Maybe once the SEC steps in, it will make a step towards it.

I sleep fine, thank you very much. I have a clear non-scammer conscience.


Except that has been the (clearly false) narrative of the camp you're supporting and making excuses for. As long as there's a consistent narrative at all of course, since it's self-contradictory and their goal is delay and sabotage so they don't care about what their arguments actually mean.


There's like 8 years of posts explaining this to death. Maybe they should do some homework instead of falling for simple lies by frauds like Ver.


And yet again you repeat that bullshit. SegWit takes pressure off immediately. You can't say it won't because you have no idea whether your magic "pressure off" condition is around 1.1MB blocks or 1.5 or 2.3MB. You have no clue. Fact is: higher pressure means more incentive to start using SegWit transactions meaning faster uptake. Self driving balance.
Unless you're one of those retards who believes that all bitcoins have to be moved once to a segwit address before segwit benefits start having effect. Yes, there are stupid FUDders on rbtc that actually spread that lie.


Yeah big mistake. You prove to the world that you don't have hidden agendas. You build the best and only possible solution in the best manner possible and get complete unanimous consensus among anyone with a brain that it is such. And then to help the rollout go smoother, you build a system where the different parties can signal each other and minimize the risk of blocks being orphaned and someone losing money. Yeah big mistake. They must be crazy for thinking all Bitcoin users would be interested in closing a gaping fatal security vulnerability asap as well as moving Bitcoin to the next scaling level. Instead you are now complaining that Core is not centralized enough and does not force updates upon users. yeah bad core.
Except it turned out that one miner was actively exploiting an unknown vulnerability that was pocketing him so much money that he could pay off other scammers and a troll army to sabotage Bitcoin to keep his ASICboost.


Econ support is here, miners are (forced into) sabotaging. Obstructing the only path forward and breaking Bitcoin. Nothing less.


More than half of that fake "econ support" you talk of is BitMain, or bought by BitMain or blackmailed by Bitmain. The rest is bullshit from Ver and friends. All proven anti-bitcoin idiots. They also have no clue themselves what they signed up for and most will never actually run any 2xshit code. Just like nobody relevant ever ran XT, or Classic or BU.


It won't. It's an obviously impossible timeline even if they would have had capable developers. Not to mention the econ support.


Haha. Dreamer.
Too bad you were too chickenshit to admit being on the wrong side and being defeated when XT died. And again when Classic died. And yet again after BU died. And you of course won't either when 2x dies. You just need to keep hammering bullshit that was already clearly rejected 3 times before, down people's throats until you get your way. Cause you are a manipulative central power hungry dictator wannabe.

That's why there are limits on the number of incoming and outgoing connections now. Which can be raised by making things more efficient.
You can't automatically distinguish between a crawler or a legit peer. Some bad behaviour does cause automatic temp bans where possible.
Also: nullc does regularly publish lists of ip addresses that he has determined to be acting badly, which people can add to their local temporary ban list. The biggest goal is to not give crawlers and other bad actors a perfect view of the entire network.
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:04:33
That certainly is key. One simple change that solves many problems and allows for increased blocksize all in one.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:37:21
Of course certainly.
Anything else would be complete braindead.
But the context was dumping the other chain, and I'm wondering whether we as random nobodies (speaking for myself here I guess) will even get the chance to do that. So much manipulation and insider trading going on even on a regular day, let alone when scammers have the power to pull the trigger at a time of their choosing.
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:48:13
And you were right. It's a bonus. SegWit was already implemented and live on the elements alpha sidechain. Made to get rid of malleability. Block size there is irrelevant as it's brand new and easy to hard fork and blocks aren't full anyway.
Then Luke came up with a way to Soft Fork it into Bitcoin, and as witness data is placed outside what old and new versions of bitcoin consider the 1MB limited space, it pretty much automatically implies an effectively larger block size.

Like i said, you can choose to take the risk. And the risk may be quite manageable. Not arguing that.


Depends on how ongoing and widespread the Sybil attack is. If it's only one fake wifi hotspot at the time you are buying 10 bitcoins in a coffeeshop, then that's already enough.
Granted actually getting confirmations requires more effort. I'm not up to speed with what exactly SPV clients do check these days, but remember the attacker does have the ability to hide transactions or whole blocks as well.
Sorry I'm not more accurate/specific. Not really awake today.

That's when you're taking about hostile takeover and contentious hard forks. Like XT, classic, BU, segwit8x and all the rest of the shit. If bitcoin can't survive those then it's over.
I was talking about a quiet peaceful scenario where one of the alternative clients has a bug that causes a split.
If you have to wait 100 confirmations because bitcoin regularly does reorgs because one of the clients is out of consensus where people lose a shit ton of money, then that takes away a lot from its value proposition. That just defeats a huge part of the prose of bitcoin.
Anti fragility means ideally one client run by all. Complete consensus no happens. In practice different versions of the same client already can give problems (reorgs have happened in the past because of that), but alternative clients make it much much worse.

He's certainly not confused. You are confused, but that's not uncommon unfortunately, and deserves great credit for trying to take away those misconceptions.
You are confused about the level of security SPV actually provides, which is actually not that great. Of course you can wave away the risk because you probably only keep pocket money on there and you're unlikely to be specifically targeted for a scam, and you'd be right. But you'd agree that that is fundamentally different than really not needing to trust anyone.
SPV security could have been a lot greater if Mike Hearn wouldn't have actively refused and obstructed improvements. And Core is working hard to enhance SPV security, or rather have a sort of "light" client that is (almost) fully validating, yet requiring a lot less resources (through UTXO commitments and such). So the future should be a lot better.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:48:01
You probably meant well but that's not how SegWit works. Starting with the fact that the 1MB limit completely disappears.

100GB in 5 years is even less. (Hopefully it will be more than 100GB by then actually.)
Gavin did tests increasing the block size 20 fold but still easily keeping everything within reach of a home user.
Currently multiple light clients exist for use on phones and people that don't need the full blockchain (you don't HAVE to, you know).
Soon pruning will be enabled meaning you can have a full node with only a fixed and configurable amount of storage: 5GB for eternity? 1GB? Take your pick.

He didn't say that. But for the record, it definitely would be correct to call it malice.


Silent is is what scammers want to be, if it's not about advertising and pushing their own product. Every word they say otherwise, digs their hole deeper: more lies, more contradictions, more displays of ignorance and lack of integrity. For all to see. So yes, it's actually very helpful.
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:37:52
He already said that one post up:


And he's very right. If you don't hold the keys, you don't own the coins. But if you don't fully-validate, then you haven't really received the coins either.
In practice that currently means you should run a full (Bitcoin Core) node (possibly pruned). And the above reasons should be *incentives* to actually do run those nodes, but apparently a lot of people don't know that, or are okay with taking the risk (like they do in the fiat world).
Whatever the reason, apparently the cost of running a full node (which includes understanding as well as hardware and bandwidth and maintenance) is too high for most people. Which is one reason that Core devs are working hard on lowering (or at least maintaining) that cost and being reluctant to increase the block size without counterbalancing measures.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:26:25
That's an incredibly dumb reason. So we have to wait a few years for some proven unqualified devs to come up with a 2MB HF plus SegWit integrated into that and then fully test everything and roll it out as one huge do-or-die update?
And in the meantime ASICboost can just chuck along creating empty blocks?
So the choice is safe 2+MB non-empty blocks half a year ago, or 2*2+MB blocks riddled with bugs 2 years from now and be stuck with empty blocks in the meantime. Who was in a hurry for scaling again?
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:00:57
It's not there. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:53:20
Nothing in the real world requires consensus the way Bitcoin does. This is not just another chat program we're talking about here.


That's almost certainly a complete lie fed to you by rbtc apologists.


You're missing the point. It's not ideological or political. I'm as anti MS and pro open source as the next guy. And in databases and RAID harddisks I love redundancy and failover systems.
Just doesn't work that way with Bitcoin.
A temporary complete shutdown of the Bitcoin system in case it crashes is better than muddying along in different directions with inconsistent and out of consensus corrupt data that is guaranteed to be impossible to merge later. One side will lose all (or Bitcoin is split forever).
Bitcoin's product is consensus: a promise that if you follow "Bitcoin" chain that you will always end up in consensus with all others that do the same (after some confirmations). A chain split destroys that promise. A pause/temporary shutdown does not. For Bitcoin to work reliably, all its users need to follow the same chain. That's already hard enough with different versions of core, but certainly not doable with alternative implementations (especiialy when those alternative implementations are mere political tools for their creators to gain power).
Anyway. Libconsensus is the answer and is being built by Core. All the above only applies to consensus code. All other fancy wallet features and graphics effects and chain indexing and whatever that alternative clients might want to do are like regular software where alternatives are good.

\&gt; You do if you want not-upgraded nodes to follow your new ruleset chain
Non-upgraded nodes (and miners) follow the heaviest chain already. Full nodes do the enforcing even if the majority of miners doesn't.
\&gt; Economically relevant full nodes are
\&gt; when you do a softfork and don't want a chain split between old and new  nodes a mining majority enforcing the new ruleset is absolutely vital.
1) There's only a risk of chain split in the first place IFF there are malicious miners that deliberately go out of their way to go against the new rules (any miner indifferent to the new rules will just be perfectly compatible running the old rules).
2) When the malicious miners do that, the economic majority full nodes will completely ignore them and not reward them with any mining rewards. They will also ignore any "non-malicious" miner that blindly builds on top of those invalid blocks, not giving them any reward either. From the perspective of Bitcoin it would simply be a short period of reduced hashing power.
Yes, blind (non-validating) miners are bad for Bitcoin (even without soft-fork), but they also incur the fullest possible cost for sleeping on the job. Yes, things go much smoother and safer if miners properly update and signal readiness for a soft fork.

Again: low fees is not a goal. The level of the fees is the aggregate output of market forces. The goal is to design the system such that such a market has a stable attractor within bounds that guarantee decentralization as well as security against 51% attack. Miners need to be incentivized "enough" and in such a way that they stay decentralized. Whatever the fee ends up being is irrelevant. If it turns out to be too high for you, then you leaving is your signal to the market that you don't value decentralization that much.

Forking Bitcoin to fork off the idiots doesn't help. In a fork everyone gets coins on both sides of the fork, which is ammo for them to attack with or a safe haven to fall back to when their fork fails. Assuming they had any to begin with of course, a lot of those trolls don't have any coins anyway. Also: the drama, confusion and chaos that a (contentious) hard fork brings is exactly what these trolls want: more confused newbies to trap and scam.
Having the idiots run off from to their own /rbtc cesspool, now that was very beneficial. Having them run off entirely to shitcoins like eth, that is beneficial as well. Idiots be gone.

ok. thanks for getting the point. I had this exact same thread 2 weeks ago with a true idiot that kept doubling down and digging himself deeper and deeper into his own shit, per typical rbtc logic.
This thread is much much better.


I've seen it all: no block size increase, no transaction capacity increase, not enough, too late, can kicking, etc.  and usually "all of the above" even though they're clearly contradictory.


My usual answer would be: SegWit IS 2+MB so yes it can happen with Soft Fork. Then I add: Schnorr+MAST+Signature Aggregation stand to reduce transaction sizes by maybe half, so doubling the transaction capacity again: also by Soft Fork. And then maybe I add that extension blocks can also be done through soft forks (in fact in principle everything can be done through a soft fork).
Now that doesn't mean I'm for extension blocks, nor does it mean I'm against a Hard Fork when the time is right.
Yeah sure an Classic like 2MB HF block size increase does require a hard fork and is not done with UASF. But to be honest, there's not even any point in the question as such a change is vastly overshadowed by the Soft Forks and updates mentioned above. Vastly better capacity increase mostly without the downsides.
Whoever wants "2MB + SegWit" better make a bloody good case for why 8x scaling in one big jump is required within a few months while doing it gradually (learning along the way, having the ability to intervene when things go sideways, maintaining a healthy fee market, etc.) is somehow not good enough and deserves to be fought tooth and nail, splitting the community and wasting already half a year and counting on blocking scaling.
The only answer is ASICboost and shitty power grabbing egos.

Agree with all of that. I have good hope that SegWit and Schnorr and Signature Aggregation and MAST will give us enough leeway for a while. Some HF is also still on the roadmap. So plenty of capacity growth in the pipes.
I'd say new users would either have to fit the description in the article OR they need to believe enough such niche users will exist to warrant Bitcoin's continuation. If they don't fit either of those descriptions, maybe it's just better they wait a year and re-evaluate.
I'm also optimistic that the group of niche users that the article mentions (drugs and prostitutes etc.) will gradually expand to include for example remittance markets and even companies saving fees on transferring money internationally. Both are possible today, however the article's point is that for those people there are alternatives that may or may not be a little more expensive, but at least a lot less hassle. As Bitcoin becomes more common, easier to obtain and safer to hold (to avoid exchange fees) and use etc. that hassle factor will go down, making the choice to use Bitcoin or SWIFT more and more a cost based decision.

Thought you were proposing it as a solution to end the block size debate, have the idiots go their own way and have the market prove them idiots  i.e. shut up the idiots. Rereading it now, I'm not so sure what you were envisioning.


Do you mean one scalable chain and one secure chain?
What kind of false choice is that?


No we need more protections against rogue hard forks, to either avoid them from happening at all or at least make it as safe as possible and as non-confusing as possible for users.
There's not even a choice available if you wanted to.
In fact the whole blocksize debate is a false choice: Core is already scaling faster than classic could even dream of even if we accepted their non-peer reviewed bug riddled code.

Do NOT trust their replay attack protection! As all their other code, it will contain many bugs, including accidintentional bugs "oops we can replay after all, thanks for your BTC". Maybe users can't do replay attacks, but their miners still can (exactly the people you should be most afraid of).

What I'm saying is there is no point in doing a transaction just to move funds to SegWit. That's just a waste of fees and blockspace and doesn't do anything.
What you do want to do is just use SegWit in whatever transaction you happen to be doing anyway when you're buying a loaf of bread or a Lambo.
Your description made it possible, I think, for noobs or people with their brains mushed from rbtc propaganda to be confused into thinking coins first need to be exchanged into segwit coins before they can actually be used. And everybody needs to do that first before we can ever get 2MB blocks. And blah blah.

Friendly warning: Bitcoin logic is deceptively difficult and getting something like this right in adversarial conditions while upholding all required incentives for miners to do the right thing.
I'm sure at some point you'll get some feedback from Core devs, but in the meantime, please don't fall for the lure of Bitcoin classic "dev" Tom Zander and the likes. Those guys live in Lah Lah land and have literally no idea what they're talking about. His ideas have been burnt to the ground many times, but he's just too full of himself to give up and keeps spreading false information to pretend "his" idea is superior and will solve all problems.
Regarding your idea, I must agree with below. But I must admit I merely glanced your idea and am not a Bitcoin dev anyway (I've just seen many ideas pass on different forums).
It sounds to me that you're merely moving the current propagation/validation/orphan problem to the "Flags", but those Flags have rewards too, so they have the same orphan problem (2 miners finding a Flag nonce at the same time).
I'd also argue that the 25% reward for those Flags is a bit arbitrary and could lead to miners only mining Blocks and not Flags because those rewards are (relatively) higher. Or vice versa.
Another aggregate effect seems to me that you're cutting the security of the whole network by 20%, since 2 out of 10 minutes the miners are "wasting" time on Flags. (Not sure if that's a really valid statement as you could argue that Flags are sort of semi-confirmations, or something like that. But I think that shows that the effects go way deeper and need careful thought as well.
Anyway, gotta run. Thanks for thinking and coming up with ideas.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:37:12


There's actually only one. Only one was designed, specced, implemented, peer reviewed and tested. Any alternative doesn't currently exist and would take at least a year to reach similar status and would include pretty much all of what SegWit does because SegWit fixes bugs and shortcomings that must be fixed before any scaling is reasonably possible.

Who says RBF is just for stuck transactions?
What about an exchange that is handling customer withdrawals? They send a transaction paying customer A, but then 1 minute later customer B also wants to withdraw. Why would the exchange not save on a little on fees AND improve block size efficiency (wooohoo! scaling! more transactions in 1 MB!!) by doing an RBF transaction paying both A and B in one transaction?
They can pay their customers as fast as Bitcoin confirmations allow, yet still have a roughly ten minutes buffer that allows them to coalesce multiple transactions into one.

1. I hope fungibility eventually becomes good enough to make fresh coins exactly have as much value as used/tainted ones. I recognise that we're not in that ideal world yet. Hard with still needs to be done for that.
2. Perfect fungibility does not take away from the fact that you're right that mining might save the owner the hassle of having to buy coins. The value/cost (in money+ time+ hassle) of the method of acquiring the coins can still different.
3. Agree on expected growth curve much more bound by Moore's law (not end of M law, rather caught up to and now parallel to (or on) M law) and therefore more affordable, wider distributed and longer shelf life for future chips.
4. Also agree mining is the purest form of earning bitcoin, or converting energy into value, or the ultimate (and only possible) decentralised exchange into bitcoin. Whichever way you want to look at it.
Still don't see why those chips would be inside otherwise unrelated equipment. And also not something we should wish for as it would squander that better distribution by centralising its hash rate to one 21 pool.
Put them into a water heater that preheats water by a  few degrees before the real heating coils (or gas) finish 90℅ of the remaining work? Yeah maybe. in a climate where that makes sense for more than half a year per year. or  maybe for warm tap water.
Putting it in a toaster that needs to produce 100W (?) heat instantly for 5 minutes per day and be otherwise completely off? WTF?
A printer? WTF? A router?
Then just make it a separate device available in several sizes so the consumer can choose how big of a unit to buy, how many, where to place it (attic, shed, living room). And let the owner decide when to turn it on or off (depending on power price, temperature, overcapacity of his solar panels). And simply have this device automatically hand over earnings to your fridge or router or toaster. Call the device a miner maybe? Home miner? Private miner? Consumer miner?
And another good thing: you don't have to throw away your built in miner when your fridge dies. Or worse: you don't have to buy a new fridge just because the asic is obsolete. Moore's law will still make the asic obsolete sooner than the average life time of most normal household appliances.

I was assuming you meant contributors as in contributors to the code base. I know there used to be people who have now left of moved on, but not really that many (and for most of those, I'd say good riddens).
Contributors more generally. I don't know. I guess some cashed out. Some moved to shitcoins. Some got greedy and now now pumping shitcoins and other scams. Some just got tired of the scammers. Some have better things to do with their lives. Some are still here but under a new name. Plenty of reasons.
I don't see how the need to re-define established terms follows from any of that though.


I doubt that. I see very few people who know things inside out and even those (especially those, since they're honest) admit to not knowing everything inside out (and that's many years after the period you're talking about).

That's not what he said.
SegWit is a Soft Fork. Honest well designed Soft Forks don't cause chain splits, by definition. SegWit is an awesome update that fixes many bugs, improves performance and scalability as well as more than doubles true block size.
SegWit8x is a contentious Hard Fork, which by definition causes a chain split. It's trying to double the block size *again* in a really dumb and dangerous manner. It's highly unlikely to ever happen though, since we've seen them pussy out at least 4 times before (and their plans and code are more stupid and buggy every time). If it does, it will simply become yet another altcoin. One of many thousands scam coins already out there. Bitcoiners will be unaffected apart from a bit of a bumpy ride.

In case you're not trolling: stop listening to idiot trolls. Miners voting for 2x is completely utterly irrelevant. SegWit was a blocksize and efficiency increase, which still has plenty of stretch in it. Many other past and future improvements have and will further decrease transaction sizes. Surely anyone would agree making transactions smaller is better than increasing the blocksize.

That's clearly nonsense as in that warped explanation, 1/4th of the signature data still counts towards that 1MB. Anyone talking about a size limit is just full of it and can simply be discarded as someone who doesn't know how Bitcoin works (best case) or even FUD spouting scammer (worst case, often more likely).
There's a 4M weight limit which in practice results in a possible range of sizes, which is actually still slightly increasing with growing segwit adoption.

Just proves you have no clue.
Years ago was impossible. Impossible. Those software engineers have been working hard all those years to keep things running with 1MB and at the same time prepare things for increase. Then more than 2 years ago they developed the one and only possible solution yet all they met was sabotage and personal attacks. Despite that they built the increase but even that is now being sabotaged to this day. 1 aug was set as the date for the great flushening of the turds and lo and behold: the retards came up with something that will activate 1 day earlier. Because those retards are now finally realising this is in fact the only way, but instead of admitting study they've come up with a convoluted backdoor method of enabling it so they can claim, to other retards (like you) that it was all thanks to them and Jeff is the big hero. Wasting years sabotaging and shitting on bitcoin and the only people in the world capable of working on it just because of their own idiocy and not wanting to lose face over it (and of course jihan making tonnes of money through ASICboost + miner centralization and Ver making tonnes of money scanning noobs into shitcoins).

Nope. Miners actively attacking the soft fork, trying to steal money, cause such a chain split.
Miners don't need to do anything, just leave the soft fork be. Not a single change in mining policy and they won't have any problems and won't be rejected and won't cause a chain split and won't be forced to do anything different.
Only if they actively change their source code to actively attack the permissionless innovation done by people using the soft fork.

Yes it can be. But not yet. Not before serious bugs and design problems hampering scaling are fixed. Which is what SegWit does. After that Satoshi's suggestion is pretty much on the Core's roadmap for 1.5 years now.

Nah. Btrash and co, in their infinite stupidity, opted not to do SegWit. Without SegWit LN is not just a copy paste job but requires a lot of actual engineering to even get it to a crippled version of what real LN is. These shitcoins don't have a single dev that could come close to having the skills to even dream of attempting to do that.
Also LN-over-shitcoin requires LN nodes willing to be a bridge exchanging bitcoin for shitcoin. I can't imagine anyone willing to part with their bitcoins only to get stuck with shitcoin dust unless for a very favourable exchange rate (ie shitcoin price pushed down).

You mean the huge drops by BU nodes during the weekly vulnerabilities were an attempt to measure? Oh I just thought it was a happy side effect: BU nodes a couple of hundred, most clearly on VPS and run by a handful of people max, while all others (the ones that didn't go down) were just Core nodes with fake advertising. Yeah that was a hilariously effective method of counting the sybils.
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:15:51

@_date: 2017-06-18 02:12:19
In case you're feeling sadomasochistic, you can have your brain tortured by his rambling and self contradictions here: 
It's the classic stuff where "oh dear bitcoin is about to fail from high fees and we need larger blocks now, but at the same time blocking SegWit because it's not opt-in and of course it's not good to force people but also SegWit will not give blocks fast enough because users will likely take ages to upgrade because they don't give a fuck about high fees apparently. Therefore we must force them to upgrade with a hard fork. Because we need field data to be sure SegWit is the right path otherwise we'll find out 3 years from now that we on the wrong path and wasted them all. But we do have plenty of field data that says that 4 to 8 MB is fine don't you worry you can trust me. Silent about who to thank for Bitcoin Bering ready for that of course, but glad to brag about being a core dev and having built the first open source satellite."
Only slightly paraphrasing there  You've heard it all before.

Which we don't need tomorrow. But still more than half of which will be delivered by SegWit and the rest will be with Schnorr + SA + MAST + CT.
So we're basically done here, we don't need any more hard fork at all to reach that goal.

Too bad classic doesn't have devs capable of doing that.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:47:05
In general: Signaling 80% means absolutely nothing. If users don't support that chain, those 80% are going to lose a lot of money really quickly and they'll switch back to the proper chain soon. Hashing power is paid for by the users, hashing power follows the users. Not the other way around.
Most (I think more than 80%) of full nodes are already signalling for segwit (BIP148). That's harder to measure than hashing power, but as an informal number it's probably pretty accurate.
Specific to segwit2x: as far as I understand it will activate segwit and supposedly even before BIP148 kicks in. So that means segwit without chain split. That's all good. (Apart from the fact that they'll be stealing credit from Core on developing and activating SegWit and other such transparent lies.)
Regarding the hard fork part of segwit2x: I doubt it will actually come to that. They know they have shit developers. They know it will all fail without Core devs. Just like they knew with XT and Classic and BU. Lots of shouting and threatening and blaming, but no action. They were always free to fork off and prove their worth.
This time they'll have some more fodder against Core: "The bastards blocked segwit2x HF! We had 90% consensus but evil Core blocked it again!" and then they'll move to their next distraction and shitcoin-pump scheme.
They were on the brink of losing face completely for even the dumbest to see if BIP148 or BIP149 would activate. In the last few weeks they fabricated a huge distraction to have an excuse to activate segwit themselves hoping they can take the credit for it and have some ammunition for the next round.
My only fear about segwit2x is that they're going to be too stupid to get it working correctly and then fuck up activating the segwit in time.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:03:43

Supply and demand. You're free to run a node with a higher fee rate.

Nice idea. It does change the issuance rate in mortals time (not in block time) so miners may not like it much and it will affect the difficulty so i guess it would need to be done gradually.
It also increases variance btw, which favours centralised miners. So i doubt you can take it to extremes like 24h.
30 minutes would give us the 300kB blocksize like wants with reduced orphan rate, yet higher variance... (Edit: 70 minutes with SegWit i guess)

SegWit people want to improve Bitcoin many ways, including massive scaling, starting with their own transactions. Permissionless innovation and the rules set out by Satoshi specifically allow exactly that. Bitmain is blackmailing and taking the situation hostage and putting a gun to Bitcoin's head by threatening with stealing money and doing pre-mined hard forks. Bitcoin has had enough of that crap and is not afraid of that gun.

Miners need to stay awake and pay attention to what's happening, just "not care and do nothing" is not enough if they want to protect Bitcoin and their own investments and keep being payed. And using BIP9 for extortion purposes is an outright attack on Bitcoin that will certainly get them fired.
Either way, the non-BIP148 chain is worthless as it has the risk of a wipe-out hanging over its head. Nobody with a brain will hold on to those coins for long. That means miners aren't getting paid anymore and they'll have to switch to the BIP148 chain where they'll get paid.

You're throwing around terms like users and economic majority and hashing power without thinking about what they mean, how they are measured (or not) and how much power they have.
Bitcoin is worth absolutely zero without the Core devs. There's nobody else in the world who have the know-how and capability and willingness to maintain and upgrade it. Without further development it will certainly bleed to death drowning in a pool of shitcoins and it will take decades for another non-scam and actually better tech coin to rise.
All (self appointed) devs ever to have worked on XT, Classic, BU or segwit2x are all proven incapable, underestimating of difficulty, big-promises-no-results, or outright scammers (most all of the above). They will run Bitcoin into the ground faster than you can say segwit2x hard fork. Oh and they're also all self-proven liars: as they've been shouting how bad SegWit is for more than a year now, sabotaging it from all sides with all kinds of made up excuses and false lies to prove their points. But now suddenly they're going to activate SegWit, lock, stock and barrel as a Soft Fork! Yeah right. So bad.
Exchanges make money on trades, they don't give a fuck about which coin wins or what the price of each coin is. They want as many coins as possible so the most people trade back and forth in them and they can rake in the fees. Plus they get huge cuts of premines of ICO's and other shitcoin pumps, just by listing the them.
One big exchange very much anti-segwit2x is mentioned here:  and guess what: they're early bitcoiners who know what they're talking about and have a vision of Bitcoin where they're themselves obsolete because exchanges aren't necessary at all anymore.
An non-designed, non-speced, non-peer-reviewed, non-tested, with scientifically proven bad parameters Soft Fork + Hard Fork, developed in a couple of weeks, mostly behind closed doors, by 1 dev who has zero experience in consensus code and hardly programmed on Bitcoin at all for 3+ years. And that's about to roll out in a few weeks (SF) + few months (HF). In-fucking-sane.
Even one single sliver of any of the above points should make it obvious that segwit2x and the people shilling for it are bad and it's DOA and never going to happen, or cause Bitcoin to die if it does. Even if all my other points are completely upside-down reversed and inside-out wrong.
Time to think for yourself.

Not (well probably all other shitcoins). Bitcoin was surgically designed to be money. Eth was specifically introduced not to be money, merely gas.


Yeah it's not just eth that's a scam. All shitcoins are.
Real Bitcoin prominants have always warned people off and never invest more than your willing to lose and how Bitcoin is an experiment in beta etc. etc.
Nobody in shitcoins has honestly done that.

Pretty simple: because one centralized mining party will never orphan itself, this having an advantage over the honest miners.
That party might be an attacking government. But it's also a subtle centralization pressure: large miners get more profit than small miners. Small miners go out of business so large miners grow larger. Or miners join forces to become one bigger miner.

Don't keep them on an exchange. Hodl and you'll automatically have both real Bitcoins and bitmaincoins. And if you do want to sell the bitmaincoins (free money and you'll help dump their price) then be very careful and make sure you know what you're doing otherwise you might lose your Bitcoins as well.

Batching has actually had a much bigger impact on efficiency than SegWit. Most larger consumers of block space are now way more efficient combining many transactions and those are exactly the parties that drove the fee up last time (other than spammers).
But then again: fees will have to go up, otherwise Bitcoin is doomed. So if you're expecting free transactions for everybody forever, then again: you're listening to trolls and scammers too much.

Yes I have. Apparently there's enough ambiguity in there to use it as a source of lies and FUD to this day.
But it all comes down to: Core promised absolutely nothing at all. Some devs promised some things and ended up far exceeding their promises, despite: Miners made promises and broke them right the next day, invalidating the whole agreement.

That's the Gun paper. I've seen multiple presentations on it, and I've never understood the point of it ("why not some multisig and locktime stuff?). Admittedly, that might be totally me. But I've also seen nobody ever taking his idea serious and most of what I see from him is overselling his own ego and ideas, completely misunderstanding Bitcoin and outright trolling.
Also, implementing a security feature in hours on top of a broken insecure unnecessarily complex and broken by design system, doesn't sound like a useful feat.


Fundamentally I'm convinced there is absolutely no point in Turing Completeness on the blockchain other than using it as overselling hype buzz word. The leadership and overselling scammers promoting it are only the next order of problems.
If you want to be novel, then build an LN like 2nd layer system (or maybe clone LN and extend it a little) and you can do all the Turing Completeness you could ever wish for on your own machine settling the outcome to an LN transaction, which eventually settles to the blockchain. No need at all for distributing ALL the load to ALL the PC's in the world, which is by definition unscalable.


I imagine one reason is because it uses balances instead of UTXO, which makes Eth a lot harder to scale, hurts privacy and makes it much easier for centralized parties to fuck with those balances (oh... we've seen that proven already). I'd also bet it's actually harder to make a safe trustless hardware wallet for eth than for Bitcoin (with SegWit).


Yet it doesn't exist yet and the idea had to be taken from Lightning. Anyway, Bitcoin is hard because it's freaking hard to make something decentralized. Once you take away the decentralization everything becomes easier. I can run a MySQL server on my home PC, with better tx rates than Bitcoin and Eth combined, which can also super easily implement bidirectional payment channels, or even a whole lightning network at once.

@_date: 2017-06-23 13:42:39


Everybody is. Not that 2011 says anything about your in depth knowledge anyway.


Then you're missing a lot.
If you have any respect for the hard working experts that have caused, through relentlessly and carefully hard work, your 2011 coins to still exist, let alone reach $2700 instead of just collapse to 0, then maybe you should give their arguments another thought and not carelessly sheep behind full retards coming up with a vague plan without specs, without design, without experienced devs, without peer review, without testing, in impossible timeline. Unacceptably stupid.
You also don't appear to understand what the "stupid war" is about.


Completely irrelevant. SegWit already more than doubles capacity thus reducing fees. After that we have Schnorr+MAST+SA in the pipeline doing another almost doubling. And then, after segwit, it's a lot safer to think about another block weight increase, which has also been on the roadmap for 2 years now.
Also there is no way you can judge a specific fee level as too high or too low. Clearly spammers are still willing to pay it, while companies like Coinbase refuse to optimize their systems to reduce the number of transactions and make them smaller and people aren't demanding the one and only possible and existing solution to be activated.
Doing two doublings at the same time (ignoring how otherwise retarded sw2x is) is just insane. You don't blindly change two fundamental parameters of a finely balanced experimental system at once.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:37:28
That's what I said.
But I've given you plenty more proof that you were wrong in the other posts. Like the weight = 4M for different size blocks. So you go rethink those first and let me know if you need more explanations.

They mined Classic or BU blocks the very next day.
But if you think that HK agreement means anything at all: first of all it can't: bitcoin is a fucking decentralized system, there is literally nobody who can promise to change anything even if they wanted to. And second the devs more than lived up to their side of the deal.
But if you still think HK means anything other than proof that those organising it had any other goal than duping devs and the community into their power play or if you are blind to the disgusting ploys and idiocy revealed by Ver and Jihan and BU both before and since the HK agreement, then frankly you're just lost and i can't help you.

A rectangle is also measured in inches width and inches height. That doesn't make the unit of the rectangle inches. Exactly the same with SegWit: the two sizes are not on the same dimension. The combined weight (unitless) however is one dimensional and that's one of the things that makes SegWit so genius: existing problems in multi-dimensional napsack transaction selection algorithms completely melt away and it's just a matter of sorting transactions by fee/weight and picking the top X until total size reaches 4M.

thanks for that info on breadwallet. I stayed a bit vague in earlier posts because I wasn't sure about the current state of affairs of SPV wallets in general and Breadwallet in particular.
If they download (and check) all headers, uses the Merkte Trees and the user actually waits for multiple confirmations, then I guess that should help a lot.
Note that when you're sybil attacked, it's still easy for the full node to censor/hide transactions for you, and they can also hide the real chain from you and provide their own false chain (at a slower pace, but yes with a lot of work).
I might be missing other attacks.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:51:38

Yeah, but the total of incoming connections (\~8 \* number of proper nodes) + (thousands \* number of crawlers and chain analysis clients). Since it's hard to influence that latter component, I'm guessing the best we can do is minimize the downsides (memory, CPU, bandwidth) of all incoming connections thereby freeing up some room for a few extra outgoing connections? Erlay seems to be a big improvement in that direction?

[ Ratio price shows what you get per BTC (other prices are completely irrelevant). So about 7.5% for the top few forks (probably less because of fees and trading losses, plus it costs you your privacy).

I am actually hoping somebody is holding on to an exploit to wipe segwit2x completely off the map the moment they start a chain split. That would be just too epic.
With Classic and BU I was fairly confident that would be the case. It was almost statistically impossible to not be the case judging from the number of fatal flaws in those code bases.
At least the SegWit part of SegWit2x is probably too simple to fuck up that hard. And the hard fork part is probably never going to happen anyway. It will just be abandoned and bleed to death just like its predecessors. It's only purpose is providing FUD for blaming Core anyway.

Multiple fails:
1) There is no problem: read the OP article again.
2) Hard Fork is not needed in short term. SegWit and then Schnorr and MAST and SA will have more impact than any HF anyone is even dreaming of.
3) A HF would take a lot more time than SW, even if it started in January. Shit is hard to get right and get consensus on and fully peer review and test, etc. If you think otherwise, go do the work. SegWit is now mere weeks away, there's no way in hell a HF could ever be activated faster than that.
4) SegWit in its current (finished, peer reviewed and tested) form is not compatible with a HF, shall we start that whole process over again? Besides, why do it at the same time anyway? If you have a HF pull request ready (with consensus and peer review and testing etc) a week after SegWit activates, we'll gladly take your HF and roll that out too.
5) It's not "the issue" that is scaring new users away, the aggressive and divisive FUD and lies from bigblockers takes care of that. Read the OP article again, it's all explained there. Give new users this article too, so they are not misled into thinking Bitcoin will be this always free unlimited payment system.
6) SegWit can possibly disprove whether further growth is actually urgent: if SegWit uptake is slow, it just means people are fine with current fee levels and too lazy to switch to SegWit (which will roughly halve their fees).
@_date: 2016-07-27 08:24:58
That's certainly an oversimplification and untrue.

@_date: 2016-07-16 18:40:59
Upvoted. Clear and level headed answer.
And in principle I (and I think most/all of the Core people and supporters) agree that censorship is bad. But the reality is that at some point you just have to say "No" to intelligent design people when they demand equal time for ID next to science. Otherwise you're just letting yourself be DoSed by the bullshit people.
Equal time for ID and you've just lost half of your productivity. Then they create another movement and suddenly creationism gets equal time too. Down to 1/3 of productivity. And then New Earth whatever. And moonhoaxers.And then the spaghetti monster. And teapots.
It's like a DoS and/or Sybil attack: cheap for the attacker and a huge burden to the defender and every failed attempt can be repeated under a new disguise.

In either case: refusing and sabotaging A because you demand A+B and then complaining you're not getting A is kindergarten level stupidity. We know your demands are fake anyway, as they have shifted many times already over the years and have become stupider and stupider.


Yeah, they dedicated many years of their lives to volunteering to work hard on Bitcoin, which they did very successfully, despite receive nothing but shit and sabotage from assholes like you saying "we know better and we care" while producing absolutely nothing. Not a single line of bug free code or anything remotely like even one good idea.
Prove yourself of fuck off.

Probably: 
Back then they spent a lot of time de-duplicating the live transactions from the ones included in blocks to save on bandwidth. I imagine either Compact Blocks or done FIBRE tech would now fix that.
They ran some live tests on real DVB network for a few months. But i don't think the demand was there yet. One of the questions is who's going to pay for it?
More bitcoin usage with more full nodes may very well result in enough demand for such a broadcast.
It is a bit tricky that you don't want this to be the only source of data though, otherwise you're trusting the broadcaster. So you'd want at least a side channel that can download headers if necessary.

First of all because there's actually no $20B bounty. Market Cap doesn't mean there's actually money there. It would surprise me if you'd get more than a few million $ out in the "best case". But sure, still a nice bounty.
Second: You know the blockchain will just be reverted again by central decree. So even in that sense, the bounty is fully fake. You don't get to claim both "secure because there's a bounty" and "blockchain reversal, so no bounty afterall" at the same time. So either it's not secure or it's centralized. And since that last point has already been demonstrated in practice, why would I trust there's any bounty at all?
Third: I don't need to prove anything, it has already been proven many times in practice.
Fourth: Because I'm not smart enough to hack it (although whenever I see how simple (in hindsight) some attacks sometimes are, I wonder if maybe if I really tried, I could have come up with that too).


Well, that's a bit too simple. Closest to your case would be: I'm too lazy/busy to waste the time reviewing my beliefs. There's so much scamming and snake oil out there that even if nothing new created anymore after today, I could still spend the rest of my life reviewing my beliefs on only a portion of them.
That's why it's a very sane idea to ignore stuff until they've proven themselves to be useful. Unfortunately that enables scammers to make impossible claims and reach less critically thinking people to suck dry, which reflects on (and thus hurts) the whole space including Bitcoin. So it's in my interest to warn people to not be so gullible and not trust golden unicorn promises. Not very effective, I must admit.
Back to dogmatic: to save myself some time I read carefully what others that I highly regard (because they've proven themselves to be not idiots and speak with such arguments that I can validate up to my knowledge level and can't see logical problems with). At the same time I count the fallacies and lies and logical twists that proponents (relevant people, not just random shill accounts) are making. For all shitcoins including Eth that balance is completely one sided.
I must say, you are the very first person who's in my first category (I don't know who you are, but I've seen you make sensible posts, if I'm not misremembering) and an Eth proponent.


I don't think so. You can separate the "complex script" from the enforcement. IOW: you can reduce any useful script to a multi-sig and/or time lock Bitcoin script. After SegWit that becomes a lot simpler thanks to the malleability fix. And possibly you might want to have a few more simple opcodes or script enhancements for some exotic use case, which are also simple to add after SegWit.
Add an LN layer over that and you don't need to settle every single transaction on the blockchain anymore either. You can keep things local between 2 parties or between a pool of parties in a prediction market or casino or crowd fund or whatever usecase and only settle on the blockchain once eventually. Or maybe make it even a layer 3 system which settles using LN on layer 2. The point is that all complex calculations and terabyte of storage required for some use cases can be simply local to the parties involved or handled by one dedicated usecase specific hub. Complaining about how such a thing would be "centralized" doesn't really hold, because anything where data needs to come from outside the blockchain (like real world events) is by definition centralized. Possibly with the exception of Paul's Truthcoin thing, but that can be an independent system with its own blockchain or whatever it needs to work decentralized and then only settle to Bitcoin in the end.


Well, blockchains already don't scale very well. Emulating one system on top of another already less efficient system doesn't sound very feasible. Plus for a lot of properties like privacy and fees and security you're getting the worst of both worlds: more points of failure. Building something secure on top of something insecure is very hard or impossible. The other way around is a lot easier.


True, but the whole network idea with still atomic E2E transactions is what LN brings to the table.


I think it is. It's deceptively freaking hard. Deceptive in that it's all to easy for a newbie with some tech/development background to read the white paper and some code and then in a few months think he understands it all. Sure the basic idea and the sense of brilliance of the inventor can be had from 15 minutes of reading the white paper. But that hides all the actual real life complexities which are the reasons that updates can only be done relatively slow (Core is still doing an amazing job) and carefully and why some types of updates are very hard or impossible.
Yes, it might be relatively easy to build a piece of software very similar to Bitcoin, but getting it to actually work with all the correct incentives balanced such that it can come to life and run autonomously that is truly hard and an unproven and ongoing effort.
Any design/implementation error there reduces the whole thing from a special decentralized byzantine solving autonomous system to just a boring normal application, but very inefficient at that. Paypal already does a better job in that area.


Which makes it more efficient (for this application) and actually helps in making it more immutable because any unauthorized change will kill the whole system. That's actually (part of) where Bitcoin draws its value from: you can trust it because it's impossible to just change some numbers. Yeah, that flexible database sure came in handy when the DOA happened.


When scaling to infinity constant factors don't matter. But we already know the blockchain will have to remain relatively small, so constant factors do matter a lot. I'm also pretty sure there are better optimizations than just constant factors, already done in the past and still in the pipeline. Especially on the area of CPU usage. SegWit is one already reducing quadratic to linear. Pruning wittness data is a constant factor (2x) but smarter pruning with UTXO commitment like things is not a constant improvement.

Sounds like you're new here.
Hashing power is irrelevant.
All you're saying simply shows that you're willing and ready to give away all your power to the first person to stick their arm up your ass. "Please master, control me, control my money, I'll be your slave, who needs regulated crooks if I can hand my money to unregulated crooks?"
Real Bitcoiners are not that dumb and I can guarantee you they outnumber the numb sheep that Ver lured in with false get-rich-quick promises. Hence miners can go suck you dry and then drop dead for all I care, it's not happening on my chain and if my chain goes to 0, I don't care one bit. Hostile takeover attempts will keep failing, just like they have many times in the past.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:09:28
Without hash rate my node says: "I don't care about your monopoly money, it's worth 0".
Are you still stuck on that basic misunderstanding of bitcoin? I hope you haven't been listening to all the other lies and profane on rbtc.
Miners don't get to decide what's valid or not. Period.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:18:22
They don't need to. Bitcoin rules allow for SegWit, everybody already agreed to those when entering Bitcoin. Permissionless innovation. If miners or rbtc assholes wish to censor innovation by rejecting perfectly valid blocks then they can try by attempting to steal funds, which will fork themselves off and we'll see who wins then.

As long as you can come up with a good and safe use case (which is actually extremely hard, look at ethereum: 0 use cases so far; but I hope people eventually do) and you do some work (or convince/pay others to do the work) I'm pretty sure it can end up in Bitcoin.


Rewrite sure. But I have good news for you: if you use an open source OS you don't need to rewrite completely, you can re-use 99.99% of what's already there and only need to change that 0.01%. Imagine the savings!
Didn't mean to be snarky, but that's just how open source works. Of course, you can put ideas out there and hope someone builds it. If it's really a ground breaking good idea, I'm sure some people will. Just don't complain if noone does.

LN was "invented" before SegWit was actually announced. It's possible but more cumbersome and more susceptible to DOS when opening a channel. Also more complex to dev, but since btrash devs are way out of their depth already anyway, that doesn't matter much.
Btrashes (yes bch) malleability "solution" is a complete joke that hardly fixes anything and is clearly an amateur response to the realisation that they fucked up being against SegWit but too butthurt to admit it.

Thinking is not enough. You can't expect $40B to accept your changes because you think/believe/hope. It's up to you to come up with data and research that shows it. Not just safe for one aspect ("disks are cheap") but safe for ALL aspects. You can probably find Core devs that when pressed would think a small increase beyond SegWit would be possible (after SegWit), in fact it says so in the Core roadmap, so you're not the only one to "think" but that doesn't mean there's consensus yet or that it has to be done today.


SegWit does that. And after SegWit there's Schnorr + MAST + Signature Aggregation, which will almost halve the transaction sizes (i.e. almost doubling transaction capacity again) as well as improve performance and privacy, thereby possibly allowing for larger blocks as well.


In which case, we stick to status quo (or SegWit). Bitcoin is an experiment, but not experimental in the sense that we just randomly dial some knobs and hope for the best.
Note how one method of gathering the data you say is missing is doing SegWit now and observing the impact that this block size increase has on the important properties of Bitcoin.


That makes no sense. No node operator would have a clue what to do with that value and there's no way to reach an automatic consensus, it would merely be like an informational survey. But that's completely ignoring sybil attacks: if you give sybillable data any value then the only thing you achieve is incentivizing sybil attacks, resulting in fake nodes that only fuck up all other statistical analysis you were doing before.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:42:56
And at the same time claim "it's so safe, there's billions of dollars of reward to be hacked but nobody hacked it". You can't have your fake security, both ways.
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:16:35


Which is bullshit, but as far as there is any effect is actually a good thing if the adoption is gradual as that gives more statistical data to learn from.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:09:07
It's not the soft fork that causes the chain split, it's the malicious miner trying to steal money (from in this case SegWit addresses).
Or in case of user activation it's the users telling the malicious miners beforehand to fuck off and threaten them with a wipe out. Then again is up to those malicious miners to make the chain split permanent to avoid the wipe out. Which is what this OP about with some extra added unrelated maliciousness while they're at it.

@_date: 2017-06-22 08:14:43


You on dope? Forcing people to update? Calling a hard fork a benefit? In a decentralized consensus system you don't get consensus by forcing people to do dumb shit.
One of the beauty of SegWit is that it's fully opt in and people are free to update and start using it if and whenever they like. Jeff is full of shit on this.
Slow transition is not a bad thing, it's a good thing.
If people don't use SegWit that's merely more proof that the "blocks are full, fees to high" drama was fabricated (which is proven in many other ways too, like the fake transaction backlog).
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:57:40


Then SegWit is more than plenty. Thanks for supporting it.

Hashrate will follow the chain that pays the most, which is (Block reward + Fees) * Price. Retard chain is not supported by devs or users or hodlers or anyone else with a brain, so Price will go to 0.

So I'm guessing this allows for growing the number of peers which strengthens the p2p network in general and makes things like Dandelion more effective? Would it make sense to also increase the 8 outgoing connections or are there other reasons for that limit?

Yeah it would lack the optimization and scaling benefits that SegWit brings making 2MB HF more dangerous than 2MB SegWit.
Quadratic hashing.
UTXO creation/destruction imbalance.
Improve upgradability (allowing almost halving of transaction sizes while radically improving privacy in future updates). Who gives a fuck about a 2x of block size when hashing of transaction size is the pipe line. Absolute no brainer.
Hardware wallets will become much simpler, more secure and more capable and usable.
Malleability is dangerous and hampers third party and 2nd later innovation. 
SegWit fixes all those (and more) by fixing fundamental design mistakes which means a lot of those problems magically evaporate. For some of these points it's not even just a big fix, it's that the whole problem area just disappears because of the better design.

It's the simplest and natural solution to many long standing problems and design flaws. One change naturally fixes or otherwise makes go away all those problems plus it increases efficiency and opens up many exciting both proven and unproven paths forwards: area for new science and innovation to flourish Effortlessly. No downside. Proven. No brainer.
Any imaginable other block size increase will necessarily have to start with SW otherwise it's simply just impossible. It's utterly braindead to not do SegWit.
Anyone left opposing SW is simply full retard or paid shill (or very new and just brainwashed by). It's that simple.
In fact there IS nothing to oppose: SW doesn't violate any rule defined in bitcoin by either satoshi or later changes. Everybody already agreed to it the second they bought into bitcoin. Clearly stipulated in the code. In fact anticipated and deliberately enabled by Satoshi.


Lie. Never done before. And what you are talking about, too hastely increasing the soft limit, is exactly what got us in this shitty place of miner centralisation, companies like coinbase wasting blockspace with hugely inefficient transactions and generally shitloads of spam filling up the 100GB history.


Anything else is not only much more complicated (proven by many failed attempts by XT, classic, BU and loads of failed BIPs and other bull) it's just impossible: quadratic hashing, malleability UTXO misaligned incentives are just a few reasons.


Yet not a single valid or logical one has come up since the word SegWit was first spoken. Put up or shut up with your rediculous unfounded claims.


Funny coming from someone who has clearly shown not to understand the tech involved. Who gives a fuck about "the other side" when that other side is deliberately misunderstanding the science.

Well, not defending OB here (never really tried it myself). But "getting" sales isn't particularly anything a small open source "amateur" project can promise you.

It's simply a huge chicken and egg problem. Existing players like Ebay and Amazon are simply extremely hard to replace. Indeed fees alone are probably not enough.
