Yeah you definitely need to get your btc off the exchange, you're playing with fire there. I would recommend any of the major hardware wallets. Do some research and see what one would works best for you. I personally like Trezor because it's open source. Just make sure you buy it directly from the manufacturer or reputable retailer, Don't buy from ebay/Amazon to avoid tampering.

If you are asking reddit for financial advice maybe you shouldn't be investing in anything. I would suggest you to really research the empowering idea of a peer to peer decentralized public ledger. You might stop thinking in USD value once you discover the importance/significance of this technology.

If I'm understanding your question correctly, you're looking for a hardware wallet in which you can exchange crypto for stable coins ?  If  so I believe the CoolWallet S allows you to do that, I think they have integration with changelly and you can make the swap within the wallet interface.

For mining bitcoin, no. 
What you could do though is mine an altcoin and then exchange it for bitcoin.  
This would be much more efficient. You can consult this website [  to see what coin would be most profitable for your graphics card.

Cash app works for me.

I would suggest censoring the last four digits of your bank account number. Some people can do a lot with that information.

It appears you withdrew your funds from Coinbase to your bank account. You should really post a new photo with your account number blacked out, I can't stress that enough.

No problem, just my opinion of course and sharing through experience what has worded for me. Knowledge is a very important and scarce asset just like BTC.

I think right now you need to invest in yourself. Get the technology you need to succeed and give yourself the best chance to land that $$$ job. Then you will have disposable income to invest in whatever you want. $500-$600 worth of bitcoin is not going to make you rich overnight. Moral of the story you never should invest money that you can't afford to lose.

The best advice I can give is don't ask reddit for legal advice, consult a tax professional if  you're really concerned.

I highly doubt that Kleinman's estate receives any btc. Craig Wright has shown zero evidence that he holds the keys to addresses that has such amount. However if one were to sell that amount of BTC they would go to an OTC exchange so it wouldn't impact price that way.

I think the greater question is why are you following a post from 4chan so closely? You should be devoting your energy exploring the significance of BTC and it's potential impact of the world at large. There is no value in that post.

The best advice I can give you is don't ask reddit for financial advice. Develop your own strategy and execute it.

At this point in history gpu mining BTC is no longer profitable.
However you can profitably mine many altcoins with GPU's, such as ETH, ETC and RVN. Then you can exchange those alt coins for BTC.

Honestly mining bitcoin at this small of scale won't be profitable, you may never make a return on your investment. It's something that you can't just dip your toe in anymore and expect a return. You are more likely better off just buying $500 worth BTC right now.
However if you're hell bent on mining, it would probably make more sense to mine an alt coin like ETC or raven then exchange it  for BTC. This would be way more profitable than mining BTC itself.

Quality thread.

To be fair if you are going to be critical of this, you should also be critical of those who are calling the start of the next bull market on a day with a major up break. One triggers FUD and the other FOMO. Moral of the story take what you hear on twitter with a grain of salt hah. (even though most view these tweets as cannon hah)
@_date: 2019-04-01 15:22:17
I would say so since when you click on the tweet you get rick-rolled haha.

Have you tired Square's Cash App???  I'm pretty sure you can buy bitcoin in all 50 states using that.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:57:45
Well if your salary was paid BTC you would have no other choice but to spend it. You answered your own question.
