They shut down when they are hacked, so once a year or so.

Mtgox charges 1%. Tradehill charges 2%. Or you pay 1% to get your money to BitInstant and then 1% to trade oh Tradehill.

I went to the site, I changed the "items from" dropdown to say United States and I get a blank screen.

Awesome video, I learned to alt-tab between windows and highlight things with the cursor.

BTC in the last month has gone from 5.2 up to 7.2, down to 4.6, back up to 7, and finally is back at 5.4. Do you describe roller coasters as "mostly flat" because you wind up at the same place you started?

Fix what went wrong with the website after the redesign.  Now when you click on your open orders half the time it shows the wrong number or you have to refresh the page, the number of open orders at the top of the page rarely corresponds to the orders at the bottom, clicking Cancel on an open order doesn't cancel it immediately. The whole site takes way too much CPU- when I have it and mtgoxlive open at the same time the fan in my laptop sounds like it is getting ready for takeoff.

Do not use MTGOX and Dwolla. When you go to withdraw your cash it will take 10 days, minimum, with vague and unsettling answers as to why it is taking so long.  U.S. bitcoiners need to switch to bitfloor.

The headline says BTC is mostly flat lately. In the last month it has been anything but flat. The headline sucks.

First real money poker site for mobile iphone/ipad to accept Bitcoins according to their own press release which probably means they have a new definition of "first."
