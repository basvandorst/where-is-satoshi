RT is **not a source** but a **medium**. You can hate any medium but sometimes it carries something interesting that makes you dig deeper.
If there were no links, then I was totally on your side: could just be crafted propaganda.
The source is the Michigan State University.

A proverb says: "What you are depends on the coincidence of what you read."
I think there is a lot of truth to it. And in that sense we should take a step back sometimes and inspect our behaviours of all the media that we consume and all the websites that we browse everyday. Sometimes it is valuable to make a change and say: instead of spending hours on this or that website, I will now read a good book instead. Cheers!

Wow.. the USA just burnt as much money as their GDP.. yawn.. what could possibly happen? I mean it's the USA! They don't vanish from the map from one day to another because a few pennies got lost... And why would we common people need to care about it? Some banks or other countries will patch it up. They always find a way. They just need to... err...

What do you mean by making the two sentences?

Sometimes it's preferable to let the least amount of people know that you posses a certain amount of money. Then it's easier to hide a private key for a Bitcoin address than hiding a big pile of cash.
