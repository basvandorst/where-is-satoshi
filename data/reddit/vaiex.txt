This is how HYIPs work. The people that get in relatively early on can make a profit. Then you have those people spreading the word for them. Then you get the unfortunately late comers coming in who don't make their money back before the HYIP closes down.

At this point it would be very difficult to make me feel it's not a scam. If they had traders based in London, someone in the London Bitcoin community should be able to vouch for them.

Ok if you understand that it is a gamble that is great - I just want to make sure that everyone understands the difference between a scam and a risky investment. By having them as an event sponsor, I would imagine that people would just assume that they are a legitimate company if they haven't come across a HYIP before.
Yes your points do point towards credibility, but if you were them would you not do those exact things to convince people to invest? But at the same time, if you were not a HYIP, there would be zero chance of you using a HYIP script for your website because that just takes all the credibility away.

And if you were printing money you would bother setting up a website where you accept investments of $20 and give them returns of 1% a day?

It's 6.5 months since we ordered our BFL Monarchs and we are still waiting on the refund. Apparently they refund you after they sell your spot in the queue... 
They're more of a terrible company than a scam. Though I suppose promising something and not delivering to the extent that they do is a scam to some extent.

Sorry, repeating myself, mentioned this above. We placed an order with them more than 6 months ago and became eligible for a refund. They said that it will take 4-6 weeks to process the refund - that is not acceptable, especially if they are as cash rich as you say they are.
Other than that, you're right, I can see how the pre-order thing can happen with the excited crowd. But it has happened twice now.

I don't think they had a booth but if you have a look at the [website]( they are still listed as a sponsor.

Some people play the HYIP game so they don't really fall for it, they just realise that if they get in early enough they can make a little profit (until the day they lose their whole investment). 
Those that do fall for it don't know what the word ponzi means so for them it doesn't matter whether it's called ponzicoin or litecoin...
The internet gets new users every day getting themselves into things they know nothing about. When I was 13, for a few days I thought I was about to become a millionaire because a 1% daily return seemed feasible.

bitcoin-trader.biz who have since shut down. You'll be able to find more information about them if you just google it or I gave a summary of why they were a Ponzi [here](

Yup we have a Lamassu Bitcoin ATM here in London (inside Liverpool Street Station).
No regulations in the UK as of yet either so it's been easy with that so far. Adding an AML process if regulations are introduced is possible but would spoil the user experience a little...
Setting up was easy and maintenance isn't too bad though converting the cash in the ATM back to Bitcoin is troublesome at the moment as no UK banks open bank accounts for Bitcoin businesses.
Not massively profitable. At this rate we're looking at a payback period of about 18-24 months. Can't imagine what it would be with a Robocoin machine!

Even with scrypt mining their advertised payout was at least 5 times higher than it should be before they changed their contract table last night? Combined with all the other factors...
Their representative at the expo was pretty well prepared though, she even had a live feed of what she said was their mining farm in China with 3 Cointellect banners hanging in the background.
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:25:56
Ahhh so a few months ago their payout table was not as ridiculous as it is today? Still... the [full analysis]( by Redditor dnivi3 from above would have been very convincing.

And that's a good thing, as long as the organisers are professional about it.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:46:29
Good work!
EDIT: I have now read your article on medium, very detailed analysis, well done!
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:39:27
I think I said in my post last year that it's not an issue if people want to play the HYIP game and they know what they are doing. But allowing a Ponzi scheme to sponsor various events like this attracts people who really don't know what they are getting themselves into and gives those companies some legitimacy.
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:40:01
If they cannot cover their expenses with legitimate sponsorship money they probably shouldn't be organising the event. Especially as promoting a ponzi scheme is itself criminal.
