I ended up on check systems after going through a rough time fighting family members in court over inheritance money. I actually walked in to a bank with a $50,000 check at the end of it all and was denied an account. It was completely surreal. "you mean you don't want to hold my $50,000 for me? wut? ok lol"

Basically yes except the heartless bastard part. Any additional use of the car such as transporting people or goods opens the insurer to more risks, more liability and more likelihood of a claim. This is why they rate the pricing differently.

At the same time less supply will mean higher btc prices which should increase the block reward value.

False. The insurance company will cancel the policy if they are advised it is a business vehicle. As a professional in this field I would suggest you speak about things you have first hand knowledge of. - derped

You would think that but that's not how most situations work. Most states side with the consumer and the insurance company may even have to pay out on a claim. This is why insurers cancel policies if they are informed of business pursuits. The company I work for won't even insure if there is an advertisement on the side of the vehicle and will cancel upon notice.

Where does the blogpost mention cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:55:00
This is insurance fraud because the vehicle is being used for business purposes while he has it insured as a personal vehicle. Business pursuits carry a much higher amount of risks than personal use and insurance carriers rate the price accordingly. Insurance fraud is knowingly deceiving an insurer and he has admitted to doing that by registering it and insuring it incorrectly in order to save money.
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:54:40
So... That's the story?
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:46:59
No. Currency, precious metals, and valuable papers such as stock certificates are not covered by flood insurance. Standard home insurance would typically cover up to $200 but does not provide coverage for flood.

I stopped reading when you admitted to committing insurance fraud on the vehicle. I understand reservations about authority but your open admission of defrauding a company who is trying to run a profitable business throws anything else you say after that out the window. Fraud is fraud and if you're OK with it when it comes to the insurance on a van I have no idea what standards you run the business by.

Except in most cases the state will side with the policy holder. The insurer will be required to pay out claims. The fraud part is knowingly deceiving an insurance company in order to profit.

Insurance policies are very basic when defining businesses. I believe the wording is "accepts money for a service".

You guys are missing the point about the price crashing when bitcoin reaches mass acceptance. He actually correct. At some point, far in the future, the dollar will be extremely rare. People will no longer trade with it at all and they will be collectable. Our great great grandchildren will trade 10s of bitcoins for a single dollar.

I actually work in insurance and this is the most basic and obvious form of insurance fraud. He is trying to say it is more expensive because the outpost doesn't have a driving record but that really has nothing to do with how a carrier would rate it. He is committing insurance fraud plain and simple.

In the United States a man once patented swinging on a swing-set sideways. Applying for a patent does not mean it is a legitimate creation. Anyone who can read and write can apply for a patent. The literate population of the world is estimated at 775 million. So 775 million people can.

Filing a patent does not require an attorney. You can actually file online for free.
