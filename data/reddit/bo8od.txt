Drop $1900 on btc, $100 on a coldcard. Job done! No having to worry about dips, China or fud. Or you can wait for when it dips to your liking and buy $1800 worth when it’s $55k.

This is from July. Keep up son!

No cold card recommendation?
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:44:26
I’m using them and all appears ok. I haven’t withdrawn yet and wouldn’t recommend over exposing yourself. I get more confidence in them since casa and blockfi are offering a deal together.

You’re still early. You’ve taken an important step. Next is a full node

Inflationary recession, better chance of number  go up. Deflationary recession, we will see but down is likely. Doesn’t matter though if you hold out. Make sure you have reserves to handle recession without touching your stash.

Send them over. I’ll take a look and let you know the difference.

I think it was American hodl who scientifically devised that number as the amount required for permanent riches and big titty bitch’s

Sell your bitcoin and leave! Have you learned nothing? For years we have said hodl. You think we say it because it’s bad advice? If you think you’re good enough to sell and buy the dips whilst not losing sats through spreads and fees, try it but don’t whinge when it’s gone. Hodl and stack sats when you can is a winning formula. Just do that.

Idk. Miniscript is cool and it was released 2019. There are too many great projects bitcoin in development atm, btc pay, bisq, casa etc. also lighting isn’t bitcoin specific
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:56:00
Because you’re smart. Don’t look at the price for 6 months and keep stacking sats.

Read Parker Lewis’s blog, gradually then suddenly at unchainedcapital.com. Then the bitcoin standard. Or just listen to guy swans podcast cryptoconomy.

Never the wrong decision to buy. $8k,18k,$80 are all good buys!
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:46:37
Sure. I think people expectations for the next decade with this are high though

Wasn’t the algorithm to generate random numbers? It’s impressive but only as an experiment.

Mods, if this is off the mark remove it. Came across the pic and thought it was funny. You can grab the shirts online @ later one bitcoin or something.
