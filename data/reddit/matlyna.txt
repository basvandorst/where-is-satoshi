Coinbase.com you’ll be fine. Buy an amazon book for.  .99 that’s geared towards selling and buying cryptocurrency. Like a how to book. They’re usually like 30min reads and yeah lol you’ll learn everything you need to know.

Man investing is so hard for people. Everyone’s so emotional, and scared of volatility.
Just FYI you’re not a moron cryptocurrency can swing 20% in a single day and no one bats an eye because it’s normal. It’ll be up
You will be a moron though if you sell because it went down a few bucks. People collect their profit. People in at 3-4K probably sold and going to just buy back in again for their original investment. 
Sorry not trying to be mean just saying expect volatility. Especially when you got banks bashing it 24/7 but secretly buying behind everyone’s backs. JPM is bashing it 24/7 yet soon to open bitcoin to its investors. Hypocrisy.

Take your loses and put everything you have into $GROW wait until the end of the month when the dividend hits and everyone buys in to get the dividend. Will go to 2.48-2.75 then sell. Wait 3-4 days buy in again when it’s 2.15 and wait for this months dividend repeat. 
Holy fuck can’t be any easier seriously.

This so much this.

������ haha! I know, I know it’s insane honestly. I’m getting into it but only within the last month. So 300 is what I have into it right now. But that’s also why I finally decided to join reddit. I need to learn as much as possible.

Are you implying a 6 year old can’t fully grasp and understand technology? Yet they can grab your cellphone download an app and play for hours all by themselves. Saying they can’t grasp the concept of bitcoin is crazy. 6 year olds know what they’re taught. Hell I met a 6 year old last year that could speak 3 languages and play the guitar. I can barely speak one. 6 year olds understand what you teach team.

Yeah so? We get it you grew up with good parents. All I was saying is there’s so many kids out their that would die for this level of a relationship with their father. It’s not toxic is smart kids need to learn about finance/money/currency. Do you think extremely rich parents wait until their kids are older to teach them how to make money? Hell no.

That’s..... resolve honestly. Anything for the buck.

Ohhhh!!! Well nah you still gonna make money ^_^b so many plebeians still don’t even know bitcoins a real thing and not a video game currency or something.

Did you read anything the OP said? They invested 600 into BTC which = .1234 BTC which means their 600 investment could double or triple but I doubt BTC would be 6x what it’s worth now in 5 years. The gross profit Margin on that jump would just make cry. Mostly because I only have 300 in it myself.

Cool story bro 
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:05:40
Well that’s where we differ, agree to disagree. If or when I have kids I’ll be doing flash cards from math to science to stocks, speculative markets even! By the time their 18 they’ll be ready for the world. That’s the way I see it.

Well again even if the money’s not there when she’s old enough to care that it’s there... the experience with her dad is what matters the most. Like I said originally.  So saying it’s obsessive and sad was what I disagreed with. Children learn a lot and I’d be more surprised if she didn’t understand the basics.  But she has 12 more years before she’s an adult and he can teach her whatever he wants. I didn’t start saving or investing until I was 25. My parents taught me how to spend money and not care. I wish my dad taught me what bitcoin was or like you said he equivalent to our generation bought me appl stock when it was cheap as fuck. Hell back then 3000 into appl is worth 1mil now. But I wasn’t taught that shit I was taught how to take my money out of my wallet, and then take a god damn blow torch to it.

I wish my dad got me Bitcoin when I was younger. Seriously speculation or not bitcoin is 4000 per coin
In 2012 it was 13 and in 2011 it was a dollar each. 
5 years gross profit margin is 99.967%
She’s 6 so by the time she’ll even care about the money it may or may not be worth 1200 or more. But in the end game 600 if lost doesn’t matter so much she’s having a valuable experience with her dad that most people don’t get. Obsessive and sad I’d disagree.
