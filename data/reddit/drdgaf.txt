I buy anything I can with btc. My last purchase was some headphones. As long as you replace what you spent, it's neutral. I try and catch a dip when replacing if possible.

That's ok, I just sold some. It'll go up.

Got it from my father. Had the "good fortune" to watch it up close. He got wiped out as a land developer in 2008. Lost millions. Had to sell the family home, and move into a little dump. 
He's almost back on top now. Couldn't have done it without solid attitude. He told me "You can cry about the thing you lost, or you can go find the next thing. The time will pass either way." He's right, fuck the past, always move forward.

That's not how life works, money doesn't define us. You still have access to all the tools and things you need to have a happy and fulfilled life.
I've been where you're at. I'm actually there right now. I took a big career risk, and I'm in the process of watching it blow up in my face. Whatever. Life is still going to tick along, and everything is still going to be fine.
Don't let yourself brood on missed opportunities. You'll be too busy to see what's coming down the road for you.

I'm only saying it because we have so many new buyers right now. A lot of them are just wanting to get in without really knowing what they're buying. 
On one hand I want to pick up the cheap coins that fall out of weak hands. On the other I really don't want anyone losing money they can't afford to lose.

None of what I wrote is directed to savvy people like yourself. 
We're seeing a lot of new buyers entering the market now. Some of them are using money they really can't afford to leave in BTC for months waiting for value to recover.
Our overall trajectory is upwards, but there are always corrections and soft spots. I'm still buying and I'm looking to buy bigger when some weak hands get shaken out. At the same time I'd really hate to see an uninformed person getting the wrong idea about this and losing money they can't afford to lose.
You don't need to lecture me about the future, I'm on board. We're on the same page. Right now though there are plenty of people still paying rent in fiat, and some of them are reading reddit thinking they can put next month's rent in and make an easy 50% in a few weeks.
I'd rather they weren't exposed to risk they aren't prepared to weather.

Fees and delays will get sorted out as the technology improves. Remember the first Kindle? It compared negatively to printed books, the new ones are taking significant market share from print. Technology matures.
The cost of mining is a feature.

Actually my most solid piece of advice is to buy a trezor (other hw wallets probably do the same thing, idk I use trezor) and setup two wallets on it, using different pass phrases. Or three.
Keep one as the real deal. Keep one with a 1/6 of your coins as a decoy for malicious people who know you have "a lot of btc" and the last as a decoy for people like border agents who you can just show .2 BTC and be on your way. Set a pin too. If you lose the trezor just get a new one and recover your wallets.
Even if you're forced to give up your coins, you've still got the main held back in secret.

Yeah probably. Owning bch before the pump worked out great for me. If it goes to $400 I'll buy back in. Hold it until the next pump.

In a few days your tennis ball is going to turn into two tennis balls. One of those tennis balls is going to be a lot of fun to play with, the other one is going land in a pile of shit. You don't know which one yet, so just wait and see what happens.

When you buy something with Bitcoin, you're still paying the dollar equivalent price. The conversion is happening, it doesn't matter if you're the one doing it or the store.
A year or so ago 1btc might have been a reasonable price for something like an xbox. You wouldn't pay 1btc for an xbox now. Unless of course you're right and you would, in which case I'll sell you as many xboxes as you like for 1btc each right now.

Gdax or bittrex, it doesn't matter so much. I've heard too much bad stuff about kraken to bother.

Short version. 
1. Bitcoin isn't scaling well right now. Transactions take a while and fees are too high for it to work as a replacement for something like a credit card. 
2. The problem is the block size, it's 1MB every 10 minutes. That's the bottleneck on transaction capacity. 
3. Segwit was an attempt to alleviate this issue by fitting more transactions into a block. It activated, and it's fine. 
4. Segwit 2x is Segwit + 2MB blocks. Twice the transaction capacity. 
5. Increasing block size isn't going to solve the capacity issue. If we wanted to scale to Visa capacity we'd need 1.5GB blocks. 
6. This 2X nonsense isn't about solving scaling, it clearly doesn't. It's about displacing the core developers, and taking control of the project. It's a scam. 
I'm sure some will disagree, but it seems pretty obvious to me.

The block size determines the bandwidth and storage requirements needed to be a node on the network. Double the blocksize, and you double the requirements. Right now the requirements are quite modest and doubling them isn't a big deal. 
The higher the requirements become, the smaller the number of parties who can afford to run nodes. Scale up to blocks capable of duplicating Visa's capacity and you're reliant upon a handful of companies to run nodes. At that point Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized coin, it's a coin owned by a cartel of companies running nodes.
Block size does need to go up eventually and core knows it. We all know it. The issue isn't block size going up, it's that the 2X crowd is trying to use the issue to take control of the project.
A small blocksize increase isn't the issue. The issue is that the people selling it right now are doing so to try to hijack control of the project.

Horrible. Come on, would you ever use a savings account that could lose half its value in an hour, and owes tax whenever you withdraw?
It isn't a savings account. It's a highly volatile store of value that we currently have confidence in. I'm not nitpicking. The point of a savings account is liquidity and no risk. You can pull cash out when you need it and you're never worried about losses. 
Bitcoin is literally the opposite. Nobody should be buying Bitcoin thinking they're "saving" their money. If your emergency fund is Bitcoin, you're asking for trouble.

Time to switch to trumpet.

Sure that's true. It doesn't negate the more important fact though that BTC's value in fiat is what matters for now.
BTC as a store of value is attractive, because it's deflationary and not under the control of central bankers. BTC being used as currency really isn't as attractive. It's deflationary, prices would always have to go down. Why would you spend BTC without replacing it? Just wait a month and you get a discount.

Yeah the new tennis ball is B2X. 
If B2X ends up being the one that is successful, BTC might actually go to shit, and B2X will takeover the BTC name. It'll become the new Bitcoin. 
I don't want this, I think core is doing a good job and B2X is driven by short-term profit seeking by miners instead of long-term thought. I still won't sell B2X for a few weeks though, who knows what will happen.
