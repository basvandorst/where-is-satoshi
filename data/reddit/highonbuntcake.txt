While righteous indignation may be the new American pastime, what you’re describing is pretty normative for financial “journalism.” Not worth the trouble of threatening toothless nonexistent lawsuits.

I see. In the past I’d had to use an exit code from the country I was in, so it was little help having just the destination code. Glad that’s changed.

Believe me, they know that they work for an entertainment network and not a news network.

This post has blovial exclamation marks in the title, so I should use it to make decisions about my finances.

If one can’t afford to lose the theoretical $200 in this example, one ought not be trading bitcoin.

Dude, don’t be a wet blanket. Other than it not having happened this is a very inspiring message.

Because the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

I wish I could say it didn’t make me sweat, or that I didn’t think about staying all in. When the stop tripped this afternoon it was a wave of sweet relief after a few nights of no sleep. That said, I considered running with the herd the last couple weeks to be speculation and not investing.

If you liked it at 15k, you’ll love it below 10k.

How? Good luck borrowing shares to short, and there are no options to leverage those swings. Why not just play with futures instead?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:13
Yep. Booked profits, left just enough on that I’m playing with the house’s money. Very easy to stay curious and enjoy the ride.

What other recent instances can you point to where “this” happened?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:08:22
I don’t think anyone in this thread is suggesting that you should do that.

The premium on GBTC is a lot lower as of this moment with the future having gone up over night. Still 40% is not atypical for GBTC. And with no options to get the negative Delta, good luck finding shares to short — it’s an ostensibly crowded trade, or at least one that people on the internet have been pointing out for a while.

What circles do you run in that you’ve seen that lots?

Meditation helps me practice it. I use the Headspace app, but there’s also plenty of free resources on YouTube and elsewhere.

No issues buying last Monday with TD in my IRA.

Right. Ego can easily get wrapped up in this — it is in some ways for me,  probably most others if they’re honest. 
But this particular aspect, where the impression of one’s money situation being extreme in either direction can impact business opportunities and friendships — thats going to be a practical matter for many. See also impressions of how a person gossips, drinks, votes, smokes weed, etc. there are certain situations where it’s best not to be regarded as extreme.

Short of a windfall, isn’t living frivolous disassociated from achieving financial independence?
