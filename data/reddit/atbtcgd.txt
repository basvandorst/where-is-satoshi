They would be in jail if you could prove it. But it is pretty obvious by the nature of the frequency it happens with exchanges and the circumstances in which they say it occurs. You shouldn't ever trust an exchange... Only ones that others can vouch for, you gotta get coins somewhere. Even then NEVER EVER  leave your Bitcoin on there. Transfer it out to your own personal wallet where you own the keys.

If you are arguing that grin will not raise in value then you are arguing the same point for Bitcoin because Bitcoin is indeed inflationary. 
If you add to the supply then you have inflation. It isn't that complicated. If you use google you are going to get 10+ different definitions of inflation. I'm talking about supply growth. The USD that is printed is mostly taking the place of reserve notes already in circulation. There is no way you are loosing 5% USD value every year it would have already been worthless by now. 
I believe whatever developer you are talking about is wrong. The reason for constant emissions is to make up for lost coins. eventually grin's inflation rate will be .001% and will be well under Bitcoin's making it more scarce. Especially since emmission is replacing coins already in circulation.

I really thought this was a great idea. I have a huge problem with the exchanges and the type of culture they are bringing to Bitcoin, but not just exchanges, all KYC/AML/3rd parties. You have all this decentralized censorship resistant currency and then you buy through your bank... it's fucking stupid. If the marketplace protocol was built into wallets then people would just assume that is how you buy bitcoin... I could also see a million problems with this..

Now that I see the situation of the said scenario that will hit in some odd 30 years. It's kinda interesting. The only thing I can guess is Bitcoin will either be worth 30 million dollars or mining will not be a big factor like it is today and the problem of securing the network when there are no Bitcoin left to mine is on a more pressing timeline than we originally thought.

Bitcoin still has a relatively small market cap considering what it could potentially be. It doesn't take a lot of money to make the price move right now. As Bitcoin's market cap climbs into the trillions it will take more and more money to make the price swing until even million dollar purchases won't do much. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency though so expect it to always trend upwards. Even with worldwide adoption the value increases over time do to its scarcity.

"trading" is gambling plain and simple. You are not going to be able to time the market. You can't hire someone that can time the market. TA is bullshit, even FA is bullshit and just because you can draw cheese wedges and bart heads over a graph does not mean you can tell the future.   
What you need to do if anything is "invest" your money, as oppose to trade, which will surely drain any money you had to invest to begin with.   
DO NOT buy any "altcoins" these are scams with little or no value. Altcoins serve the purpose as testnets for a future Bitcoin. They cheat the system by centralizing their blockchains to make it appear as if the technology is better than bitcoin.(Say transactions are settled instantly on "xAltxcoinx" and they claim that it is faster than Bitcoin therfor better.) The truth is that all they have done is increased blocksize which has centralized their nodes and disregarded what gives cryptocurrency value to begin with and that is decentralization and censorship resistance. Bitcoin is constantly improving and staying completely decentralized to get there. This is how we are gaining real gold like value on a digital currency that can be spent like cash. (think internet in the early 90's, Bitcoin is much like the same protocol with the same set of hurdles and challenges.)  
You can buy as little or as much bitcoin as you want. Bitcoin divides down to about 1/1000 of a cent right now. Don't worry how expensive 1 Bitcoin is. Just dollar cost average every week/month 100 bucks and you will be good. If you can't afford that do $25 or $50. Just be consistent with your investments and don't spend more than you can afford to lose. If you do this I promise you in 10 years from now it will be the best investment decision you ever made. It certainly has the potential for life changing wealth.

The security you get with ASIC is just so much better than GPU. Try to do a 51% attack on Bitcoin. You can't because all the ASICS are already mining Bitcoin.   
Good luck on your 2 year waiting list.  
Bitcoin's hashrate distribution is more diversified than any other crypto.   
So yes Bitcoin is the most secure, decentralized, and censorship resistant.  
There's always a company on top like Bitmain and they will come and go.

 That is fine and still consensus. Hardforks are already the answer to the problem you are talking about and a great feature of Bitcoin. Miners and nodes are well prepared to take sides in such an event, it's happened before. What would be wrong is to implement something like "digishield" or alter the protocol in a way as it requires more than 51% to attack the network for "security" purposes. That would actually be less secure and would add more centralization and be reckless.

That is only true for an inflationary currency though. Those same mechanics do not work with a currency whose supply is fixed. Bitcoin has a system that will keep it somewhat stable entering in later adoption since there is a small inflation rate for the next hundred some odd years. But won't matter much as a globally adopted currency. The fed tries to keep USD around 2% inflation a year to encourage spending as opposed to saving. It is a way to stimulate an economy but not very smart in the long term.   
You say fiat only crashes about once every hundred years but that isn't true. Sometimes they don't crash at all like the pound sterling(which is over 1000 years old.) But the feds manipulate the boom bust cycle which occur almost every 10 years naturally to get prolonged and increase monetary devastation when it finally hits. All the while debasing your savings by 2% every year(sometimes more as much as 5%, that is huge!) And they do a lot more, Bailouts, etc... The fed has many tools to manipulate the currency to fund whatever they wish. War comes to mind. It isn't just happenstance Bitcoin is finite. It stops man made manipulation and greed. So even if their is somewhat of an inflation rate it isn't able to be controlled for evil reasons. The far end of that spectrum being hyperinflation completely ruining the attempt of the groomed fiat. But that is an important point as well because what if some nut gets in control(or Russian spies) and debases the dollar on purpose as fed chair or the like? That would not be possible with a trustless currency specifically Bitcoin.  
I truly believe once Bitcoin starts hitting trillion dollar market caps and becoming accessible you will see a slow steady increase in your savings overtime(it is a deflationary currency so this is mathematically true as long as it is being used) as opposed to erratic jumps like it does now.

When dealing with Bitcoin there are only 2 pieces of information you need to worry about. The Bitcoin address(public) and the key for that address(private.) There is also a way to back up your address and key using a 12 - 24 word seed phrase. Both the key and seed need to be written in multiple locations and kept extremely private or else someone can access your Bitcoin. Also make sure you can find it because if you lose this you will also lose your Bitcoin forever.  
Bitcoin is stupid easy, you are making it out like it is some super complicated math problem that only a mathematician and a computer programmer can figure out. The first time you use it you are going to be blown away with the technology itself. It is easier than sending an email.

This doesn't make any sense.   
Bitcoin needs the internet to be sent and received and for the transactions to be recorded on the ledger. How could you do this offline with a physical coin?  
How could you divide your physical bitcoin into 100 million pieces?  
There would be no way to protect from counterfeiting the physical coin or prevent double spending. The physical coin would be confiscatable and easily stolen.

It really depends on where you live. If you live in US there is no Bitcoin ATM that is "anonymous." They all require ID and other documentation under KYC/AML.
The best way to get it anonymously is to receive it as a payment for a good or service.  
You can also try [localbitcoins.com](  
But one of the coolest and easiest ways to get it anonymously is Bisq, a decentralized Bitcoin exchange.

If you are a beginner I would just stop thinking about price in general. Bitcoin is not something you just throw money into and get more money out, especially 6 dollars. Bitcoin is a weapon and it has the power to ruin you and your family. I really want to drill that into your head right off the bat. If you are new to investing I suggest you read and learn as much as you can and I don't mean spending money on trading analysis. If you are looking to invest You should probably look into savings accounts first and work your way up to CDs, IRAs, Stocks, ETFs, Gold.  You need to dollar cost average for at least your first year of investing.  
Buy Bitcoin because you know that it is real money and that you understand Austrian economics and free market capitalism. Buy it because it is a powerful weapon that can destroy governments and banks. Good starting places for Bitcoin research would be Ludwig Von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard, probably even Peter Schiff and Ron Paul.  Read every link listed to the right of this post under "Resources"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  
Don't buy Bitcoin on the assumption that it is going to dramatically increase at all.   
Just buy some, hold on to it or spend it. It is insane technology and you will see why the second you start using it.  
Just be careful and welcome!

until actual "adoption" It may linger at these levels or lower... Until that "killer app" comes along.  
(Which realistically could be 10 years from now who knows???)  
Bitcoin only has a few use cases right now, cross boarder payments, countries suffering hyperinflation, Timestamping??? Fungibility will add more users, Scalability will add even more, dapps and decentralized internet will make it something everyone uses multiple times in your everyday life.  
Until more advancements are made realize that the only thing driving Bitcoin price is speculation, not usability.

If someone gave you a gift of Bitcoin I doubt their intention was for you to immediately go and cash it out into shitty fiat money. What a complete waste. You cost them KYC,AML, exchange fees, transaction fees, now you are going to experience that all over again yourself. What a fucking waste of everyone time. Whoever gave you that money obviously cares about your financial well-being and is trying to make a point. My advice is to hang on to that and never sell it. Only exchange it for goods and services if you have to. You can use [Purse.io]( to buy anything off amazon at a 30% discount. You can pay your phone bill on ATT. You would be an absolute sucker if you didn't hang onto it though... It could literally be worth thousands one day. Just my 2 sats.
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:24:30
Currently the 1mb blocks have kept a well groomed and modest blockchain size. This allows you to run full nodes on phone type hardware or even a raspberry pi. This gives more access for people to participate overall in the network(especially in poorer countries.) We don't know what the correct answer to scaling Bitcoin is and some people think we should even lower the block size to a 1/4 of what it is now. One thing that is for sure is that no one seems to be willing to sacrifice decentralization for anyone's scaling agenda.
The more likely solution is multiple solutions, such as lightning and statechains. The more solutions the better. Speedy transactions are not what gives Bitcoin value, we already have visa, paypal, libra, etc...  
I would prefer Bitcoin to be slow and expensive on-chain if that means higher security and higher decentralization.

"the whole dip thing that's happening" Just try not to be intimidated.   
Especially if you buy a little and see more dips like this.   
Bitcoin gained 20% in one day so a correction is absolutely normal.   
In fact it does this pretty regularly and there is always some article out there full of shit trying to FUD.  
I've doubled my money on Bitcoin but I've done it by dollar cost averaging. Find an exchange you are happy with and set a scheduled buy every month for $100-$200 bucks after you feel comfortable buying smaller amounts to see how it all works. The beauty of the Dollar Cost Averaging is that when the price of Bitcoin goes up your stack is looking pretty sweet, when Bitcoin is going down you are buying up cheap coins at a discount. It's a win-win. People who try to time the market and trade pretty much lose every time. That's from the school of hard knocks.   
Also above else, What Bitcoin does for the world will make you a lot wealthier and free as an individual than any gains you see against fiat.

How on earth does decred have better decentralization than bitcoin when Bitcoin has the most nodes/miners/hashrate/hashrate distribution? Think.  


Consensus is a feature of Bitcoin, not a problem. It has always been the answer In the event of a 51% attack, we just fork to new algo. Typically the case when bad actors get involved in the protocol too(bcash)  


Similar approach to implementation of security maybe, But not similar security. Bitcoin's hashrate blows every other crypto out of the water. It is the most secure.
Idgaf about main chain scaling, let the 2000+ other altcoins who havn't found a real answer to on-chain scaling sink there time into the research. There might not be a solution for decades.  


As if the whales don't do crazy stuff with the price today, why would you want to replace nodes(which are amazing) with billionaires? What?

Volatility is a result of the low market cap currently.  The total value of bitcoins in circulation and the number of businesses using Bitcoin are still very small compared to what they could be. Therefore, relatively small events, trades, or business activities can significantly affect the price.

I think the biggest misconception is the price.   
When I have talked to randoms throughout my life they always say that it is too expensive to get into.   
Ultimately it is the lack of interest which leads to the ignorance and misconceptions.  
A Lot of people don't question their money or even their government.

Unfortunately not all Bitcoins are the same in a sense. Bitcoin is basically a giant open public ledger.   
Where my coins go you can follow. [Even the the DEA praises Bitcoin how it helps in tracking criminals](
Think about this. You send me a transaction. I can now look at your address and every address where that Bitcoin has been and where the rest of your Bitcoin goes... The government demands your crypto exchange hand over all your personal data (they comply.) Now they have a link between you and your money and where your money has been spent... Government demands exchanges immediately freeze your account if you try to cash Bitcoin that has been involved in a hack at some point, or any crime for that matter.  
When  I say fungibility I am referring to Privacy. The fact of the matter is Bitcoin is not fungible. And that ain't FUD it's just the truth. Yes there is coinjoin, lightning is supposed to help too. But privacy is not the default on Bitcoin, that is a misconception.

You cannot prove that any manipulation is going on so your statement is false and baseless.   
Bitcoin has a very small market cap so it doesn't take a lot of money to make the price swing.  
Just because a lot of money is entering and exiting the market does not mean manipulation.  
Bitcoin is manipulation resistant.

Tomorrow we must pledge half of our money in return for shelled walnuts. This helps the government get rid of excess wallnuts and make a lot of money. The only problem with this idea is we can't figure out what to do with the shells. Some say you can burn them but others want to turn them into renewable coffee cups... We shall see once law is passed... You are however legally allowed to own Bitcoin so long as you did not buy it, receive it, steal it, or acquire it in any way. finally on sunday that is when we publicly humiliate tax evaders (government in india shaking magic 8 ball of laws) WRONG BURN THE WITCH!

I really want to agree with you but hear out my situation as I tried last week again for the 3rd time.  
Bitcoin core is using roughly 300gb of upload data a month which there is no way where I live that my internet can handle this, I only live maybe an hour outside of a major city as well. That isn't even mentioning the download data that is half or more of that. The other people who are on my connection would not appreciate it as well. The only way I could do it is to somehow add a separate plan that only I use for the node which is going to cost me monthly and not to mention I need dedicated hardware I don't want to be using my computer. This is all fine but it is a lot of work/time/money I don't have just to run a core node, let alone lightning. And none of it gets compensated. If in the future I have the resources I will 100% donate my time and money but at the moment I can't do anything.

You might not notice at first glance but Bitcoin slowly takes the power away from the state. Which in turn limits their role of governance over the people in general.  So many unjustified government laws, programs, and departments that are either a waste or disgusting overreaches of the constitution or just crimes against humanity like militarism. Taking away their power to print money is huge. It keeps them fiscally conservative which in turn should keep them a bit more responsible if they even still exist at all. No one likes to admit but ultimately in the end it takes away their power to steal through taxation. Just a smaller government in general does not have the capabilities to stampede over people with unjust force. Bitcoin is a weapon of agorism. A system of peaceful revolution.

This is true, last time I calculated when that happens it will be 30 some odd years from now. You will definitely see the impact of Bitcoin's decreasing inflation rate in your life time and how it effects the incentive to secure the Blockchain. This is contrary to what most people believe will happen in 100+ years. Even if the price of Bitcoin hits 10 million, transaction fees wont come close to the reward that miners recieve today from just transaction fee alone, let alone the block rewards.

Depends on what kind of value you are looking to get out of it?  
If you just want to help Bitcoin, Run a miner as a hobby, make a few sats on the side while doing it, might be ok. You arn't going to get a lot of technical functions out of it and are limited by the Operating system they have installed. probably a lot easier than doing it yourself though.  
As for profits, depends on your electricity rates. Even with free electricity I wouldn't expect to make a whole lot with just one of those things.

A Bitcoin or lightning node is important for businesses because it offers a higher degree of privacy and security than using custodial options like cash app or even just using a stand alone wallet. I would hope all merchant processors would include Bitcoin payments into their systems someday. Ideally however, It would make more since for every business to secure their own transactions by running lightning nodes... Specifically out of the box kits like Casa are what I would be looking to integrate into their payment processors because it makes it "easier"   
once you are up and running it doesn't take much maintenance. Possibly a few updates here and there.

 You keep reiterating that you think the state has to enforce contracts, which is statist. I am saying the state has no business doing that in the first place, which is Libertarian/anarchist/capitalist/freedom. I am disagreeing with you on an ideological level. Just because the state enforces something does not mean that it is stopping you from actually do it, it is using violence if you don't obey.
It doesn't work like that at all... I didn't mention anything about children what so ever. You did mention coercion by the state. You believe the state must enforce contract law which is the system of government we have today. And I reject that system fundamentally on all levels whether it be Bitcoin or government.  
I'm glad you understand Bitcoin to a degree now go learn about the ideology behind it.

First of all.. Blockchain is Bitcoin, the terms are synonymous.
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:05:56
A smart contract is an agreement that can be enforced through a blockchain. Rather than relying on trust or a legal framework to ensure that each party that enters into a contract will adhere to its terms, you can use the blockchain to create a contract that is automatically enforced, between two people, in a decentralized fashion.It's kinda the whole point of Bitcoin. If someone breaks the contract then it is obviously null and the contract is no longer viable. You can't make multiple keys, everything is timestamped and only the original would be accepted. Your house example would be no different then the keys to your savings.
You are obviously advocating state enforced contracts which is why I called you a statist.Either you are or you arn't. You put the negative connotation behind it not me.

 Whenever you create a wallet think of it like your bank account.  
You will have 2 pieces of information:
1. Wallet Address (Account number)(Used for receiving Bitcoin)
2. Private Key (Your Password)(Used for sending Bitcoin)(Do not let anyone see this)  
Those are the only terms relevant to Bitcoin when it comes to transacting.
Certain brands of hardware and software wallets use backup passphrases, questions, or codes. The one you will more than likely encounter is a randomly generated 24 word "seed." You can use this information in the event that your wallet is lost or stolen. Make sure you write it down somewhere safe as this is the only way you can recover your wallet.

Which is basically through your bank.   
All POS systems need to have Bitcoin wallets.  
All Payroll services should offer Bitcoin.

There arn't enough ASICs for sale in the world to do this. You would have to generate enough power to supply an entire city. The cost for a private individual to do this would be insurmountable. The largest mining pool is around 10% of the hashrate diversity. If it was possible to go higher I'm sure some would have by now because it would be inanely profitable to just go ahead and mine the coin.  
Governments do not have the resources to destroy bitcoin and I don't think I would appreciate my tax dollars going to something that will wreck me financially. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:10:31
Right, honestly once the transaction has been sent with proper fees it is more likely for it to go through than swiping your card and your bank denying it.  
It has happened to me 5 times now where my bank has denied a transaction. twice they have shut my whole account down for a week, essentially stealing my money. And this is the best security they can come up with?  
I've had a bank skim some money out of an account before for reasons I am still unclear of.    
I have never had a Bitcoin transaction not go through ever.  I've never magically had Bitcoins disappear from my wallet only to reappear again. I've never been denied a transaction. Shit if a merchant required so and so TX fees I dunno what the problem is with paying in bitcoin, the speed wouldn't be an issue at least. Hell Bitcoin settles faster than my checks which take like 3 days.
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:52:40
I am still a hardcore Bitcoin maximalist... sort of. And I'm thinking in the future here.
In certain aspects I see Bitcoin as a web, like the internet. Imagine trying to use 2000 different internets just to find the webpage you wanted. On the other hand I believe in the free market's right to have competing currencies. Yet it just isn't that simple because Bitcoin is so much more than money. The more people that use it the more decentralized and secure it becomes. It really tricks your brain because everything else in life works the opposite where as if everyone only used FaceBook(like they do) it would be more centralized and less secure.
But a true decentralized platform is THE platform for how decentralization is achieved, No one actually controls it, there is no other way to do it. And you wouldn't wan't all these DAPPs and dust transactions, increasing block sizes, changing algorithms, proof of stake and what not being tested on the Main Chain. You are liable to screw something up. And I think we all get it, bitcoin right now is not perfect to do what everyone needs it to do. In some ways I see all Altcoins as sidechain testnets for developing new technology and applications that will someday be used on Bitcoin. But I think when it comes to security, a company is going to decide on the safest blockchain to put their platform on. They  aren't going to use an inferior, less secure blockchain for their product.
I know Altcoins will never go away. It makes total sense to develop your own blockchain to run tests on. But when you start putting so much faith in a testnet that it will overtake Bitcoin or even do something Bitcoin can't do I feel like in the long run you are going to fail.
I know even here I'm going to get a lot of hate but this is my opinion.

By keeping Bitcoin's block size at 1MB even the most basic of computers are able to verify transactions. Anything over this blocksize starts to run the risk of more powerful miners validating blocks faster than smaller miners with less hashing power causing the small miners to not validate at all. This is actually what makes Bitcoin the most decentralized blockchain.   
Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that is the idea.

Literally Etherium will never be a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin because they have already centralized it with rollbacks and excluding smaller nodes. Not to mention Etherium has constant emissions unlike Bitcoin's scarce set 21million coins.  It's value is in testing DAPPs and nothing more. I totally give credit to Etherium (and Litecoin too) for being big players as testnet for the Bitcoin Blockchain. But don't ever hold your breath for Etherium to become a currency.  
The only real thing that gives a cryptocurrency value is decentralization otherwise it is just another credit card, bank, federal reserve, or payment system like paypal.

Dude if you are thinking about trading you are just gambling, and gambling is stupid. There is nothing to TA or charts or fundamental analysis that can prove anything. It is simply gambling...   
Especially with something like the current Bitcoin that doesn't take much to raise or drop the market cap thus changing the value wildly.   
Seriously it is stupid to think you can time the market. You can't tell the future. Just like you can't know lottery numbers before they drop. You have a 99.9% chance of losing money and if you are extremely lucky you will hit. Don't let some dildo on  youtube flash a lambo in your face and tell you that he knows what he is talking about. Bitcoin is not some magic money generator.   
The only good advice I have seen posted is that you need to get a job.   
If you want more Bitcoin you need to buy more Bitcoin, Or start a mining company.

A huge benefit of deflationary currency is the value goes up over time, unlike fiat currency which just gets printed into oblivion. What are you complaining about? Your store of value performing to well?

@_date: 2019-05-29 12:32:04
The entire point of Bitcoin and any crypto currency is to be decentralized and open source.   
It's value stems from these properties. It is what makes it new and cutting edge technology. If crypto does not live up to those standards it is valueless, essentially a janky way to run a paypal or bank of America that barely functions. That is why Bitcoin is really the only crypto that has intrinsic value because it retains what makes crypto useful.  
BCH fundamentals are based on wreckless scaling attempts that have very heavily centralized their blockchain and excluded players/devs from contributing. There is a right way to scale(to prioritize decentralization) and a wrong way to scale(have complete central control over the majority of nodes and wrecklessly run up the size of your blocks which will eventually make the thing useless(ethereum also for example) Bitcoin has scaled smart using upgrades like Segwit and Lightning network that doesn't compromise the integrity and security of the blockchain.  
It isn't like Bcash is any different from any other altcoin but what makes them have a special place in our farts is they deliberately try to scam new people coming into the space to buy BCH over Bitcoin. Bcash lead by "Roger Ver" Owns Bitcoindotcom(unfortunately) where he shills BCash and misleads people into unknowingly buying Bcash. I hate to say it but check out the site yourself and you will see. It is a total racket he has going. They spread misinformation and constantly bash Bitcoin and lie about blockstream. They are definitely not doing this space a service.  
Yes one could say Bitcoin is slow compared to just handing over someone a 5 dollar bill in person. But food for thought, it took 3 days just to send 1 email in the early days of the internet. It takes Credit cards One day to process a transaction in 2019.   
Bitcoin is doing it right by establishing value.

I don't believe Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.   
It serves a purpose and has a very vast market.  
A large part of Bitcoin's value is derived from it's decentralization.  
Where I believe Bitcoin inherits intrinsic value is how this decentralized network can be utilized.  
Money, banking, contracts, voting, deeding, etc...

Of course this scenario would be rare...   
most people would find the dead's seeds when looking at all their financial information either in a deposit box or a safe in the closet, and then snooping through the phone and computer would find just about everything else. Grampa would probably leave the seed in his will unless he hated everyone. Most husbands/wives share financial info(unless they are smart)  
I just see these things as rare "Opps lost keys!" stories.  
Most deaths are certainly untimely, but I think for the most part the recovery of a dead person's Bitcoin is pretty easy. Especially as better common practices take place when it comes to owning and using Bitcoin. If you care enough about an amount of money you aren't just going to "Oops lost keys!"

Second, you are going to need a lot more sophisticated hardware than a mac to start mining.

Bitcoin is actually the most decentralized crypto there is. Just look up hashrate distributions on google and check it out for yourself. This coupled with total hashpower (proof of work) is what makes Bitcoin the most secure and decentralized system in the world.   
Bitcoin is extremely censorship resistant and that is the law that goes above all else.  When you understand why that is the true goal you will understand why Bitcoin will never increase blocksize recklessly or add extra Bitcoin's to the total. Bitcoin is fair to all participants who want to run nodes no matter hardware specifications. The ledger has been maintained very well and is incredibly tiny compared to the volume and activity that goes on Bitcoin on a daily basis.

Look at people in Northern Alaska or deep in the Amazon Rainforest.    
Food, medicine, weapons, ammo, spices, fuel etc. will get you a lot farther when it comes to exchanging things. In all out apocalypse not many people would use Bitcoin IMO. I think we would use gold/silver for "money" if there isn't another acceptable trade.

Every system creates hierarchy you willy. Bitcoin isn't communist.   
It isn't even a government. It is a way to coexist without government.  
it is the exact opposite of government.   
Of course humans are going to continue to work together.  
That is what we should do. But never through force.

You can speculate all day the reasons why so and so did such and such.  
If you are so sure of your manipulation theory and that the market is going to get tanked again why don't you use that knowledge to your advantage and make some money from it? If the whale is buying now why aren't you? Sell when it hits another spike? What are you complaining for if you got it all figured out?   
You sound like you got into Bitcoin a month ago and tried to do some day trading or bought at the top and ended up getting rekt.

I have posted over there a few times to get reactions/explanations.  
It seems to all stem from paranoia over Blockstream the company invading Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin has increased it's blocksize quite a few times since it's creation. at least 5.  
There was a very real war in r/bitcoin a while back where just talking about increasing block size got you banned. That is why we are all so salty towards one another.  
Now, I don't believe in increasing block size(right now) but sometimes I feel like you shouldn't be banned just for talking about Bitcoin fundamentals or trying to help improve Bitcoin, because it is a healthy debate. This forum could have very well ignited the fork, which was not a good thing IMO.  
I just think they are missing information over there, they only have it half right and are not seeing the bigger picture. again, a lot of paranoia going on. EVEN THOUGH blockstream does not come close to controlling bitcoin what is to say it couldn't happen to Bcash? They are supposed to play by the same consensus rules but they don't. They would stop any upgrade to Bcash that wasn't approved by Roger and his community. The more they fight open source devs/people from contributing to their own blockchain the more (ironically) they become increasingly centralized. Which is basically what they have become. They do rollbacks, they have centralized nodes, they don't participate in open source decentralized progress.. and that is the thing, Bitcoin isn't just for us, it is for everyone to contribute.   
We arn't going to exclude blockstream or any dev. We are going to let consensus play out no matter what. That is what gives Bitocin value, and makes Bcash smell like a turd.

buy a piece of small PVC pipe and two caps. It doesn't have to be big at all 1/4" will do. Now write on paper your information. Put in a ziplock or waterproof bag and roll it up inside the PVC. Prime and seal the ends. Now bury somewhere only you know that it exists. Use landmarks so you wont forget. Do no use any metal as It can be detected.
This is a take on something my grandparents used to do with jars and coins during the depression era and in times when banking wasn't as common or not trusted. In terms of security this is one of the best things you can do to make you rest easy at night, and anyone can do it as it is super cheap and virtually undetectable and unconfiscatable.

Disadvantages as to what?  
That is like asking "Internet disadvantages?"  
I'm just really not even sure how to answer that.  
At one point in time it took Email 3 days to reach it's recipient and was overall slow and clunky as hell.  
I think what you meant to ask was, "Bitcoin Improvements?"  
Obviously the answer to that is development.  
1. Speed  
2. Volume  
3. Privacy  
4. Decentralization  
5. Security.  
All of these areas could welcome improvements.

Don't ever let some 19 year old trading analysis douchbag or a hedge fund manager with a bunch of charts on youtube convince you that you can make money "trading" Bitcoin, or stocks, or whatever. Trading is gambling plain and simple and you will lose. No one can tell the future especially some cheesy guy with a pen and a bunch of squiggly lines.   
Just buy a small amount every week, or month depending on how much you actually make.   
When the price goes down you can be happy for the cheap coins,  
When the price goes up you will be grinning because the value of your portfolio is increasing.  
Dollar cost averaging is a win win.

Forever grateful for you and honored to be able to listen when you have anything to say or write.  
Your message will live on forever through Bitcoin!

Bitcoin is actually one of the most manipulation resistant markets there are.  
It isn't fair to say someone entering or exiting the market is "manipulation"  
It is just a very clear example of supply and demand.  
When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.
As the years go by and Bitcoin gains more trust and resilience there will be more people in the market therefor more Bitcoin distribution causing the price of a Bitcoin to drastically stabilize compared to what you see today. We are just taking our first baby steps here still in very early adoption phase. People forget that we are still in Beta.

I think what he said was in context.   
If you can somehow read the market so well that you think you have some whale's gameplan figured out why would you not imitate it? Even with $100 to spare you could ride on the waves of the notion that a whale is also accumulating or dumping and profit.  You wouldn't need millions.

I would love to see both of the communities reunite once again and drop all the hard feelings.   
But we have to get one thing straight first, Bitcoin will not be centralized. Period.

Money is money you asshat. Just because it comes in a digital form doesn't mean it isn't evil.  
And money doesn't solve every problem in the world. Bitcoin is incredibly incentive driven.   
I don't want my stack of Bitcoin becoming worthless by you essentially bailing out an internet based exchange.  
It's that fucking simple dude.
