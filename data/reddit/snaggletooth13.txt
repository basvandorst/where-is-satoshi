That’s not how reporting works. Banks would just file a report and enter it into a database. You’re information is not immediately given to a local fed agent. 
Also, I get the idea that their reporting is new and bare bones based on how recent the IRS agreement was made and that they have AML / BSA jobs on their careers website.

Always good advice. I'll look into it when I get a moment. I'm mostly just learning about the whole space having been converted from a hater to a believer only recently. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:42:21
Man that's a lot of billions of dollars from people who are dumber than you. That doesn't mean they are right, but lots and lots of people and money disagree with your assessment. At some point, eventually, you'll have to reconsider right? I'd say 6 months ago I would have agreed with your general premise. Now I believe in the technology side. I do believe that we'll end with a small number of coins though eventually and it will condense sort of like the dotcom bubble. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:07:02
I'm only scratching the surface but can you explain more or link me to an explanation of the lightning network? I've seen it referenced but only in its ability to increase transaction speed and reduce fees. I haven't looked, but didn't know there were other applications for it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:26:57
I don’t wanna over explain a boring industry but in short: it’s technically possible but very unlikely.  I’ll explain further if you care.
Only potential fraud can stop a transaction like that and would likely be on the bank side not the Coinbase side. The issue is most likely an internal error and a lack of proper support / IT. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:16:50
Your comment is correct for bitcoin and many other coins. I've read that law enforcement call bitcoin "prosecution futures." Meaning there isn't a great way to mine (for lack of a better term) the blockchain for information efficiently yet but there will be and its there for all time. 
There are privacy coins that have found ways to solve the issue while still maintaining the premise of the blockchain and ledger through a couple of different ways. I know ZCash and Monero are in that space and there are several more that primary marketplace purpose is maintaining privacy. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:33:30
It depends on how the regulatory marketplace sees it and shakes out. I used to be in the Anti Money Laundering industry and have friends in it still so I have also followed from that point of view. Our guess is that countries will eventually attempt to regulate the privacy coins somehow. It may better serve Bitcoin and Ethereum to stay potentially transparent, at least until adoption is more universal. My main point is, I don't think the privacy coins are going away in the next few years because that would broaden the already large target crypto has on its back.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:41:56
The irony is that this is a real life proof example of EXACTLY why crypto is gaining. What if I told you there was a way to send money in a secure, un-manipulatable way confirmed by a decentralized ledger that doesn’t require 3rd party authentication? Boom.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:00:25
It's a reckless market place for sure. You can make a coin popular based on an internet meme right now. A team is about to become ultra rich from the popular garlic bread meme.
I think the name "cryptocurrency" was either way to early or poorly chosen / adopted. Very few of the coins (again, bad name) are actually trying to be daily use fiat. To match fiat, they would have to be manipulatable in order to keep the price stable which doesn't match the basic premise. Price stability requires supply control and any coin that has supply control isn't decentralized (to me). Instead, in the broadest terms, I see them as more like a store of value for some coins and others, the coin price is the stock price of the marketplace solution the development team is trying to create in the background. The biggest issue to me is not "if" crypto will stick around, its more like will it be regulated a ton while the corporations catch up and create corporate blockchain solutions. A lot of the value right now is centered around first to market and wide spread acceptance. So we have lots of examples where the "improvements" aren't big enough to overcome the "established" cryptos. Just as an aside, I don't have very much stake in cryptocurrency. I put about the same amount that i'd be willing to put on red at a casino and treat it as such. It was just enough to motivate me to follow several of the subs and learn about the tech. The more i learn, the more I wish I could "invest" in the "stock" of blockchain technology as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:29:47
One guy already mentioned this but its harder for people in stable "rich" countries to see the value at the moment. Our system (USD) works and is reasonably trustworthy over a period of time. A large part of the world doesn't have stability, or consistency or access to a bank. There are certainly people that will get rich scamming people and riding this wave but there is also the grass roots side that loves the idea behind it. This is pure free market capitalism and its the wild west right now. To your point though, I agree that like all modern capitalist societies, it will eventually condense into a few noteworthy coins and those few may or may not have even been created yet. I think right now its like the dotcom era and hopefully some of us are putting money into google and facebook and apple but we can't say for sure.

No telling really. Someone with backend IT experience might venture a better guess but there are so many options it would be a total guess.
Coinbase / GDAX is the most “corporate” style exchange but all of them have shown problems with upscaling. His update says he got bumped up the food chain so his public outcry must have helped. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:05:57
I agree man. I was yelling that it was stupid less than 6 months ago but once you research the tech its mind blowing. That said, governments and banks don't give up control willingly so it will be a curious battle.
@_date: 2019-02-14 02:16:40
I’m sure this will get buried but I knew Blake Benthall in college. Can anyone link me to his latest update / story??
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:06:39
Yeah of course, if they charge a fee and make a profit they do. There are just a lot of semi sarcastic questions about "is it a commodity or a currency!?" and the answer (even if people don't like it) is that its currently both in the US.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:41:25
Because profiting from currency exchange with a license is illegal in the US. In addition, being party to a currency exchange in which you have knowledge of illegal activity is also illegal. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:53:50
Interesting work. I understand the concept of the banana metaphor. My understanding was that most crypto is essentially fiat but the government just doesn’t want to officially recognize it as such because that would give it additional clout? No one has really commented that I’ve seen. I agree that this is new territory for everyone and that having parties representing the people is important as the legal framework is being shaped for years to come.
Do you think crypto or bitcoiners are starting to be targeted disproportionately compared to a person acting as an unlicensed fiat exchange?
How would you like crypto defined? Or is the goal right to get any sort of definition so that citizens can accurately react?
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:56:43
Blake Benthall? I don’t think he had a wife. I went to college with him and new him pretty decently pre dark web black market site manager.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:57:17
Making money is not illegal. It doesn’t even directly cost money to register as MSB. You do have to meet a set of basic standards to stop people from laundering illegal money. If you got paid in bitcoin it’s regular income. If you sell it on an exchange or even p2p in small quantities for market rate without acting as an exchange business it’s not illegal.
This standard, has been the standard for a long time. Crypto is new to it. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:14:00
Making a profit on it is. Facilitating money laundering is. Also being in jail for drug related charges would have me guess moving money in an unregistered way was related but the article doesn’t say.
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:28:16
My friend is somewhat high up at Citibank and its essentially the same thing. They can force the use of their current customers but nobody will intentionally seek out a bank's blockchain solution. If anything it puts the name on more people's tongues but nobody is going to sell their bitcoin (or anything else) to get in on the ground floor of JPMorganChaseCoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:58:27
Only the IRS is regulating like a commodity. Everyone else is regulating like it’s a currency. The government refuses to acknowledge it as a currency but admits it acts like one. Still confusing but not surprising.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:36:55
Are people getting arrested for something other than operating as an illegal money services business? I haven’t seen an example otherwise yet. 
I don’t want to take away from good work. I think drawing attention to that is still good but everyday this sub wants to grab their pitchforks on how it’s a total injustice that we can’t just all be our own mini, undocumented exchange. If you wanna fight for that, great but it shouldn’t be a surprise that people are getting arrested for it. 
Some bulletpoints:
- You can’t profit from the p2p transaction itself (fee, commission, etc)
- Volume and amount weigh towards perceived intent (if you make 1000 transactions or move 1million dollars it becomes harder to explain why you didn’t just use an exchange).
- Crypto isn’t being singled out, this applies to any undocumented funnel point through which money laundering can be done
- In addition, any hint that the other party has done something  illegal and you should cancel the transaction
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:05:55
This sub does this once a week. What do you mean the guy funneled 1.5 million in a way that avoids all detection for a profit and got in trouble? The government hates crypto!
I’m all for decentralization and shaking things up but we have to stop acting so surprised when the government punished people for creating a money laundering tool, no matter their intentions. 
Other than pure libertarianism, what is the point of avoiding an online exchange? Avoiding taxes and avoiding detection of illegal activity... regardless of your views on what our country should be, we must admit this is expected.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:52:06
It drives me insane how many people don’t understand, at all, the basics of anti money laundering laws and related MSB transaction requirements. I’ve tried to explain structuring a lot but every time a transaction gets locked on exchange or someone gets is trouble for something else people start yelling about $10,000. Good write up.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:42:55
Square seems to have the corner on small business payment services. If they can bring crypto into the eyes of that many people it will be big.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:12:15
This is the safest way for sure but at the very least don’t charge a fee. That’s the clearest way to call yourself a MSB.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:43:56
In monitoring (my background is in AML, not legal) it’s a grey line between what is business use and what is personal use. If your volume / dollar amount isn’t to high and there isn’t profit outside the agreed upon trade then you would be able to argue that it was a simple commodity sale (and profit or loss would still need to be claimed in your taxes). There isn’t a set line. Conservatively, any dollar amount that would make someone say “why wouldn’t they just use an exchange unless they were hiding something?” is a good starting point for making sure you don’t get flagged. Any inclination that illegal activity is involved from the other party and you’ll need to bail. Anything at all, even a hint. If you show up and they have a pot leaf bumper sticker on their car, nope. Lastly, be careful out there. People are robbing p2p bitcoin sellers, more in other countries but it has happened in the US. (Standard: I’m not a lawyer, don’t take advice from an internet stranger but I like answering questions remotely related to my former AML industry).

Has anyone seen anything on Defcon from 2.0? I search periodically but it seems like he just disappeared. He bought a Tesla with bitcoin like 4 years ago so I assume he had some dust hanging around. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:04:27
What does DHS stand for?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:04:07
Not OP but my understanding is: Yes you can write off your equipment. Your gains should reported as regular income and taxed at whatever bracket you are at. I'm not sure at what point you create the valuation for the mined coin though, with the market volatility, arbitrarily choosing the 12/31 value doesn't seem fare.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:00:03
If you pay your taxes and enter / exit through registered exchanges there is no reason to think J Law would attempt to regulate via individual cases.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:08:46
It seems like he was operating an unregistered MSB business and potentially took funds he knew were the proceeds of an illegal transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:00:27
IRS is taxing like a commodity. FinCEN and regulatory bodies are treating it like a currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:58:08
I didn’t declare it. It’s being regulated as money and taxed as commodity. I didn’t choose that confusing middle ground but that is whats happening.
And I’m not familiar with that random excerpt from the judge. Unfortunately unfair targeting and entrapment issues are rampant in all of law enforcement. 
Again, I think your work should continue but a large portion of the cases you reference and often come up in this thread, have people clearly acting as an MSB and my point was that negative legal action shouldn’t be a surprise. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:18:40
You use this logic every day when you spend dollars instead of investing them as well. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:45:45
Lol pretty much
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:26:51
Ah ok, I’ll check it out. If anonymous is your goal, there are still options but generally you are safer on the exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:09:42
Direct exchange for that amount of money is illegal in the US and Europe and the majority of Asia. In addition it’s the profit he was gaining. When you charge a fee for your services you are acting as a business.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:54:02
He sold over 1.5 million in bitcoin p2p transactions for 2 years for a profit without registering as an MSB. It’s not a weird obscure law. 
The article makes it sound like random guy sold .1 BTC to an undercover fed on Craigslist and didn’t ask for a copy of their drivers license. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:18:20
You know what I change my mind. Good on you, stick to your beliefs. I support that.
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:52:21
He’s also in jail already for drug related charges. We don’t know if they are related but it’s very often something else that gets you on law enforcements radar. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:55:01
It’s been illegal to act as an unregistered MSB and it’s been illegal to assist people in laundering illegally gained proceeds. Bitcoin is just the new medium. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:58:19
The bottom line is that you shouldn’t be upset when you break the law even if the law doesn’t match with your theoretical libertarian ideals. You can vote and influence or move but being outraged  about a very predictable outcome isn’t profitable. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:35:22
We don’t know if it’s involved but it’s one of the reasons people hypothesize why he got in trouble. The structuring threshold is really a secondary issue entirely. Either he has to operate a registered MSB or he isn’t responsible for the 10 reporting threshold, his deposit bank would be.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:23:35
I agree with this for the most part. I should have just left it that if (not saying this guy did for sure) someone did something illegal, it shouldn’t be surprising they get in trouble. There are hints this guy did some questionable stuff, if he didn’t I hope he gets off but I won’t be surprised if he is railroaded. I still don’t think it has hardly anything to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:49:12
Instead of INVESTING them. Dude who comments on a two month old comment is retarded.
