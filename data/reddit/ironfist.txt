One has 10x as much activity?

Same way you do anything else, you change/overthrow the government.  The government only exists by the will of the governed.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:27:17
Not backed by anything, that's cute.

Did he buy that pizza with BTC?

Why do you assume I'm referring to violent revolution?  I wouldn't say it will never happen though.  Never is a long time and world history shows empires rising and falling all the time.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:22:39
BTC can be divided into like 10k pieces.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:19:11
Sorry, $2.50 is the best I can do.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:00:41


As if they have a portfolio.  :D
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:22:14
You can't explain that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:17:13
And this is why BTC will never go mainstream.  The learning curve is *way* too high.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:07:38
Price has been bouncing all over today, same as usual.  :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:26:40
Most people will never own an entire gold bar either.  What's your point?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:48:12
That's just like, your opinion, man.  Seriously though, bitcoin is still a relatively new technology with huge potential for growth.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:05:18
Exactly.  Wall Street is just like a casino.  The system is rigged in their favor.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:06:07
You know the amount, the sending address, and the receiving address.  That should be enough info to trace it.  Bitcoin is *not* anonymous since the entire ledger is public.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:46:55
The "Unix" trademark can apply to many operating systems.  Yes, OS X is a huge success but so are Linux and the various BSDs.  Linux absolutely dominates the server market and the mobile market thanks to Android.  I don't think I'd call that niche nerd thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:51
Rapidly approaching $17k now.  Futures start on Monday, should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:42:52
Coinbase takes credit cards.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:05:02
Assuming some other coin doesn't take over.  BTC is hardly the only crypto arround.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:48:58
We're still around $14k, not too bad.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:59
I'm more interested in killing the corrupt financial system.  The philosophy of BTC is what appeals to me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:04
That's exactly what it is, a coincidence.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:14:56
Faster confirmation times.  I'm not an expert and it's possible that bitcoin will update to handle more volume.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:42:03
If your grandma is asking about it that means this shit is about to take off.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:41:18
In a way you're probably right.  What makes BTC different than LTC, XRM, etc. etc. other than branding and mindshare?  Right now Bitcoin is king but that could change in the future.  Enjoy the ride while it lasts I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:11:44
No panic, I was sleeping.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:28:00
Satoshis will just become the common unit of trade.  It's a lot like the Yen or the Korean Won.  People are used to buying things in units of 10k, 100k, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:48:31
To be a world currency the blockchain would need to handle millions of transactions per second.  I don't know if BTC will ever be capable of that but there are other options like LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:48
The government needs to keep their dirty hands off it.  The market *is* the regulation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:51:56
Speak for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:51
There was a post just the other day about it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:33:46
How does tumbling coins help when every transaction is public?  It shouldn't be *that* hard to go through the blockchain to trace where the payments went.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:51
I'm thinking about putting a few grand in.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:14:33
With a market cap of $55 billion it would be quite a feat to buy every coin on the market.  If BTC crashes people can just move on to another currency or fork the chain any way.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:05
Just ride it out and HODL.  The worst thing you can do is sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:55
Yeah, I meant in the US.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:00
The world is very different than it was 5 years ago.  There's been enormous legal, political, and technological changes since then and we could talk about it all day.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:42
I've noticed that Coinbase lags behind GDAX a bit.  GDAX just blew past $19k like it was nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:50:31
The exchange would have records or whoever sold them can send you a 1099.  You could also estimate the value using historic data.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:56
There is no "may".  You owe taxes on any gains.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:53:16
You'd have to convert everything using the exchange rate at the time of the sale.  You are being willfully obtuse here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:29:18
All that CPU time wasted for nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:56:51
Just imagine if you pasted in the wrong receiver address.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:48
Nah, I figure if they can't get their facts right on one subject then they're probably wrong about everything.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:03
We've reached critical mass.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:51:34
Good.  Fuck the Fed and the rest of the corrupt financial system.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:58:49
Bitcoin, maybe, but there's plenty of other coins out there.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:15:32
That's just like, your opinion, man.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:07
Seconds even.  $16999 right now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:28
What makes you think it's going to crash?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:33
I wish I could have 5 years ago.  :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:51:46
Doesn't matter what other exchanges say.  The value is what *you* bought or sold the coins for.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:55:14
Well, it's possible you could have a T1 or ISDN line back then.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:11
Do you *really* think bitcoin is going to crash to 0?  Even if there's dips you'll most likely make your money back in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:18:42
I'm fully aware it's not easy but I also don't accept excuses.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:44:15
Unfortunately in the real world better marketing often wins out against better technology.  We've seen it time and time again over the years.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:49:54
You need to leave instructions in your will on how to access your funds.  A safety deposit box with your login info and private keys might be a good solution.
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:09:19
I think you missed the entire point of what Jesus is saying here.  BTC would also count as a treasure here on Earth.  What Jesus is saying is to be kind to your fellow man and build up *spiritual* treasure which has an eternal reward.
@_date: 2014-01-17 18:37:31
Sure, why not?  Most of their systems are automated any way.

Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are peer to peer, there is no centralized service like Paypal used to send money.  One of the main benefits of crypto currencies is that they cut out the middle man.  If I want to send money I click send and paste in an address, done.  No wire transfer fees, no check cashing fees, no conversion fees, etc.
To answer your second question, you do not have to buy coins, you can also mine them.  You could also take payment for selling goods and services in bitcoin instead of USD.  You could even get your employer to pay you in BTC.
When, not if, your hard drive dies you can restore your wallet from backups (you do have backups, right?).  Paper wallets would work during a power outage assuming you have some prepared ahead of time.  Same thing applies with USD.  How do you access your money if all the banks have no power?
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:14:20
Don't kid yourselves.  The only reason most people even care about BTC is because of the price.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:21:43
I can afford to lose it, doesn't mean I *want* to lose it.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:21:56
Sorry but I have bills to pay. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:36:04
I think you're missing my point.  I can pay my bills just fine but that doesn't mean I want to lose any more money than I already have.  While there's a chance the market will recover part of me also fears that it never will.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:32
Funny how this happens every time the price drops.  Hmmm.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:58:53


And we see how well that worked with the Euro.  Using the same currency as every other country is not a good idea.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:20:00
Heh, I've worked with sites that have to deal with huge traffic spikes every year.  Black Friday ads, Christmas sales, etc. and we never had an issue scaling out the site to meet demand automatically.  While I don't work at Coinbase outages like this are a sign that there's something wrong with their internal processes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:58


I work in IT and yes, we *can* blame them.  A site like Coinbase should have auto-scaling enabled to handle traffic spikes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:01
It's not.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:46:58
Now look at the 5 year trend.  You'll notice that Amazon and Apple both level out after a while.  The gains in BTC over the last few years are great but don't assume it will go on forever.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:31
What does he have to lose?
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:53:59
Then it's time to overthrow the government.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:51:08


You don't deploy servers *until you need them*.  Autoscaling and load balancing with services like AWS is very easy to set up and you don't pay for servers until they're deployed.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:17:06
Fiat/government money can be converted into *any* crypto though.  If I want to trade with somebody using Dogecoin I can do it.  There's nothing that makes BTC unique or better than any other coin.  At least in my view as a casual user.  I understand the whole Libertarian, anarcho-capitalist philosophy of Bitcoin but to me and most people I know why not just use Square or Paypal?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:43
Saving money is fine but OTOH, no risk, no reward.  I'd be pretty well off today if I'd just put a few thousand bucks into BTC 5 years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:39:39
People thought it was crazy to invest in Amazon too.  Oh, this Internet thing will never take off.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:07:58
The problem is people aren't *spending* the coins.  The more people that buy and hold the more the supply goes down.  Why would you want to spend your BTC when the value just keeps going up and up?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:16:59
They may be hosting some things on premise but they should still have the ability to deploy new nodes as needed.  If not their IT department needs a serious overhaul.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:34
The site is definitely having issues.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:29:15
You can do these things with *any* crypto currency though.  What makes BTC different?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:09:23


No but I can write a check or do a wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:17:30
I guess there's a reason DevOps and SREs get paid well.  :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:31:23
Bought at $9900.  If i sold right now it would still be a 10% gain.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:44:04
As long as you're pricing BTC in USD you're just gambling.  At some point people are going to start cashing out.

I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.

It's only money, you'll make more.  It's a lot easier for a young person to take risk than an older person that has kids and a mortgage to worry about.

Fuck that, he has the money and Tesla makes great cars.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:53:34
Why would they?  They're probably making a ton of money from it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:46:45
At some point you need to cut your losses.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:56:30
That doesn't guarantee it will do it again.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:29:10
So is this good or bad?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:13:27


And then what?  No stores around here accept BTC.

The *web* came out in the 90s, the Internet itself existed before that.  University networks were connected together which is what lead to the invention of the www and gopher.

Not that much different.  Eudora has been around for ages and it wasn't much different back then compared to any desktop mail client now.  We also had Netscape Mail and a few other apps that I can't remember.

More importantly, what can you buy with them that you cannot buy with traditional currency?  Yeah, I know there's drugs, etc. but to most normal people the question is what is the point?
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:46:28
Ain't nobody got time for that.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:31:07
And what are they cashing out for?  Traditional currency.  Think about that for a minute.

When strippers accept bitcoin you'll know it's reached mainstream status.
