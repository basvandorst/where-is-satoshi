The video says their simulated currency reduced interest rates... when they're already rock bottom and even going negative. It also mentions being another tool to control inflation and interest rates, which is the opposite of what bitcoin does. Bitcoin takes away the power to manipulate currency. Whatever they were simulating wasn't "like bitcoin" in any sort of monetary policy sense. They still don't quite seem to get it. If you make your currency easier and cheaper to move into and out of, capital will flow out of your currency toward the one with the least inflation.

No immediate plans, as we'd like to see an extremely user-experience focused solution. I think multi-sig service providers will gradually evolve into something like deposit insurance. It should be as simple as pairing your wallet with a provider by scanning a QR, and then they will auto-cosign your transactions based on anti-fraud algorithms, like credit card companies today, and pay out if they get it wrong.

Economies don't "want" anything, only individuals do. If you are exporting a product, and you can accept whatever you choose to in exchange, then all else being equal, you will prefer to accept the monetary standard which has the greatest degree of both scarcity and durability (fixed supply).
If you have to lower your prices to find buyers (and your suppliers have to lower their prices to sell to you in tern), that's all fine, but what advantage is there in trying to obfuscate this by debasing the unit of account? That will only result in miscalculations and misallocated resources.

If you bitcoins are protected by a password, they aren't very safe. Selecting a cryptographically secure password is something most people don't know how to do, and if you did, it would be easy to forget. You want a secure hardware device protected by a short numeric passcode (like an iPhone or dedicated hardware wallet), or have the private key recorded on paper.

In the case of a malicious upload, there is a time delay between app submission and going live on the app store, and several team members are notified using multiple communication channels, giving us ample opportunity to stop it.
You are correct that until an independent third party can review the source and then verify that the publicly available build is indeed built from that source unmodified, that people using that build are putting trust in the breadwallet devs (specifically me, since I build and sign all app submissions, and verify that the same build is what appears in the app store) I put my personal reputation behind it, and I'm publicly known and reachable. As I mentioned, we continue to work to remove sources of non-determinism from the build to make it easier for third parties to verify, so even this trust requirement can be removed.
I also agree that there are secure desktop systems. My point is that it's not realistic to expect non-technical bitcoin users to use them. iOS and Android M on the other hand are the most secure mass market computing platforms out there, and the safest way to use bitcoin that's accessible to hundreds of millions of people.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:21:21
We verify that the build in the App Store matches the one we uploaded.
To independently verify from source, you need deterministic builds. We continue to try remove non-determinism from the build, but haven't yet been able to remove all of it. The next best option is for someone to decompile and examine the differences to verify that its only normal build differences and not source changes.
I disagree with the 1000usd figure. That's a figure I would put on desktop wallets. Desktop systems are typically not malware hardened and don't have hardware encrypted keystores.

You didn't respond to my argument, twice now, about which currency the individuals involved will prefer to hold a balance in. Are you conceding the point?
Suggesting that Greece wouldn't be facing it's current problems had they not switched to the Euro is a counter-factual. I would argue that the primary cause was excessive borrowing and spending by the Greek state. Serious problems resulting from this couldn't have been avoided through debasement of a local currency.
Your point about rapid deflation is only a possibility when currency is based on debt. When money is created through loans, you see rapid reduction in the monetary base when people start to loose confidence and all try to de-leverage their debt simultaneously. This is why modern economists and central bankers so greatly fear deflation.
You are incorrect about hoarding. People only hoard (save) until their preference for increased future consumption over current consumption is met. We see this with bitcoin. Those who are sitting on the largest gains from the 5,000% runup since 2013 are the most likely to spend some part of their holdings.

That is the traditional wisdom, but let's explore it a little bit. Why then wouldn't it be advantageous for, say, the people of each US state to standardize on a different currency? The more any given group of people wants to boost exports, they can simply all agree to devalue their currency, so what might be the disadvantages of this scheme?
Do you think those exporters would each prefer to hold balances in the local devaluating currency, or in a global currency with no possibility for devaluation?

FDIC insurance isn't primarily for protecting against bank robberies. Private insurance would be adequate for that. FDIC is to prevent the bank runs that happen with ever increasing frequency in a free market system when banks offer demand deposits but only keep fractional reserves. If you don't have the reserves to cover your pay-on-demand liabilities, you get bank runs. The banks will say they can just sell the loans to make good on the deposits, but of course that doesn't work when lots of people sell all at once, crashing the loan market.

Your funds are not actually on the phone. They are on the eternal blockchain maintained by the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.
All that is on your phone is a key (your recovery phrase) that proves to the bitcoin network that those funds belong to you.
Putting your recovery phrase on a second secure device is an excellent idea. Since your funds and transaction history are on the network, any device with your recovery phrase can be used to see your history or spend those funds. This is also why you must keep your recovery phrase secret.
@_date: 2016-04-04 04:48:38
1) the app is open source, and uses industry standard BIP39 (which I co-authored) with the default BIP32 wallet layout for the recovery phrase - there are many wallets and tools that work with this standard
2) the peer-to-peer bitcoin network stores your balance and transaction history on the eternal blockchain
3) the recovery phrase is stored in the hardware encrypted secure enclave on the device - you write it down in case you lose the device
4) yes, you can use your recovery phrase with as many devices as you want
5) you typically don't have to worry about confirmations unless you have reason to mistrust the party you are transacting with, or are transacting a large amount - although it's not impossible, invalidating a transaction before it confirms is fairly difficult and doesn't always work, and breadwallet will warn you if it observes an attempted "double-spend"

There are decentralized, private, secure standards like bip75 coming online to improve the state of bitcoin software.

Dedicated hardware wallets and the secure enclave built into the iPhone each have their benefits. iPhone uses app sandboxing, hardware encryption, and enforced code signatures, the same techniques hardware wallets use to harden the device. A trezor does have a smaller attack surface than iOS, however with breadwallet, you can get things like BIP70 payee identity certification performed right on the hardened device, while a trezor must trust a host computer for payment addresses. iPhone is strongly protected with AES hardware encryption if the device is physically stolen. If you choose to have a dedicated device just for holding your funds, you can further increase your security by not installing other apps, and disabling other services and accounts in settings.

Using bitcoin addresses as verification is poor practice. It's like asking someone to connect to a server from a specific IP address. What if the user has a dynamic IP, or is sharing their IP with many other people through network address translation, or what if they used TOR specifically to make sure it's impossible to connect their IP with their identity?
Your best solution would be to send all the funds out of the wallet, deposit the required amount plus enough for a transaction fee to the address in question, then send the required amount out. It will necessarily have to come from the only address with funds on it.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:56:52


It's not a linear trade off, but yes, if a few people at the margins can't run full nodes who used to be able to, that's an acceptable trade off to make the use of bitcoin accessible to millions more people. At some point the trade off stops being worth it, but that point is not 1Mb.

You can see the commit history. The main changes are greatly reduced memory usage (to handle wallets with thousands of mining payouts for instance), improved core-data performance and app launching speed, detection and avoidance of bitcoin nodes that don't follow standard network relay rules, basically things that you won't notice because it just works the way you would expect more reliably.
It's mainly a maintenance and stability release which provides a good platform for some more ambitious new features in the future, like transaction metadata, optional key escrow, ability to request invoices and payments from email, sms and social media identities, generally things bitcoin will need to break into the main stream.

A trezor allows you export private keys through a recovery phrase, same as breadwallet. breadwallet uses the secure enclave in the iPhone, and allows you to verify payment addresses with BIP70 right on the hardened device rather than having to trust a potentially infected host computer. We love trezor. Each product has it's own benefits and limitations, but we believe security wise they are comparable, especially if you have a dedicated device that you don't install additional apps on or use for general web browsing, and disable extra services and accounts in settings.

Again, this ignores the economic incentive of miners. If they were just hobbiests, then sure. They are not. The vast majority of hashing power are businesses with significant costs.

the data is encrypted with a key embedded in the secure enclave, so it would run but wouldn't have access to private data. If the machine was compromised at install time, that may be an issue.

It is actually. All devices have full filesystem encryption by default, as well as locally enforced 2FA. Factor one is possession of the device (something you have), and factor two is a fingerprint or passcode (something you are, or something you know). Although it is possible to disable these, they are enabled by default during device setup, and on iOS 8 and up, breadwallet checks to make sure they are enabled.
We think trezor and ledger are excellent devices, but they still trust a host device for payment addresses. They are simpler devices with a smaller attack surface, so they have the advantage in that respect, but an iPhone has the code signatures, keychain service and app sandboxing needed for strong defense against malware. A flaw in wi-fi/bluetooth/NFC for instance wouldn't allow code injection due to the code signature restrictions. This is the same technique used by dedicated hardware wallets to prevent malware being loaded via USB from the host system.
@_date: 2015-06-03 16:38:27
Yes, I can understand that since it's coming from the wallet author. But we have opensourced all the code and were using an accepted open standard instead of a custom one like a certain other popular desktop wallet.

That's essentially what it does. If you enter an amount greater than your balance it just says "insufficient funds" since that's intuitively the response you would expect. When you enter an amount that's below or equal to your balance, then a user would be confused by "insufficient funds"... "what?? I have the funds, it says so right there!". In that case we pop up a message explaining you have insufficient funds to cover the network fee, and would you like to send the maximum amount you can instead?

iPhone is a locked down malware hardened platform with code signatures, app sandboxing, keychain service, and full filesystem hardware encryption by default so funds have strong protection even if the phone is physically stolen. Breadwallet also connects directly to the Bitcoin network so there's no server connection to get phished/man-in-the-middled/go offline.

I don't follow, wouldn't it be trivial to just use checkpoints for the stuff you want, like lower fees/bigger blocks, and not the stuff you don't want, like blacklists? In any case mining is so expensive it will quickly cease on any fork that bitcoin users don't want.
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:34:22
Breadwallet is designed to be secure for any amount. Devices are hardware encrypted by default, so you have strong protection even if the phone is physically stolen, and iPhone is the best protected against malware among popular computing platforms. It's a locked down device with mandatory code signatures, keychain service, and app sandboxing. It's the only wallet connecting directly to the Bitcoin network that also runs on a malware hardened platform.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:21:32


Of course... which is why I also suggested a soft-fork to enforce it. The other suggestions required a hard-fork.


Also remember that higher transaction fees prevent lots of people from being able to use bitcoin at all, so with that in mind, how big is too big? If 1Mb is the optimal size, fine, then let's see some simulations and testing to find what's going to break when we hit the limit. Submit pull requests to fix it. For instance, we're going to need some method for users to be able to tell within a few seconds with a high level of certainty if their transaction has been accepted by a significant portion of hashing power or if the fee wasn't high enough to make it in. Nodes will need a way to limit their mempool size without the rejected transactions being constantly rebroadcast and gumming up the p2p network, etc...


You do realize that was just a less-than-ideal-but-workable solution to the problem of a majority of hashing power not doing what bitcoin users want. No one thinks that's a desirable outcome.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:16:08
That would only be true if the chains could be "merge mined" or feasibly mined by hobbiests not primarily motivated by cost/revenue. This would not be the case and the losing fork would fail to advance to the next difficulty adjustment.

Of course as the reward decreases, the energy consumption (and security side effect) will be reduced relative to what it would have been without the reward decrease, if you ignore the fact that the current valuation of bitcoin is in large part based on the expectation of that reward decrease. There are a lot of other factors though. As bitcoin adoption increases, presumably also transaction volume will increase, so total fees will go up. But you are correct that these two sources of mining revenue are mostly independent of each other.
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:46:16
It's also important to remember that hard forks don't actually work the way you described in practice. It's only a theoretical technical possibility that ignores real world economic incentives. In the real world, one fork or the other will win out, gaining all economically motivated hashing power and leaving the looser unusable. The losing fork will just be an aborted orphan chain like all the others that get created every day through the normal functioning of the network
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:44:52
You'd have to specifically design the fork with merge mining and/or difficulty adjustment in mind. No one with anything like significant hashing power support is proposing that. It would just be a blocksize limit rule change.

I think you have that backwards, the value of bitcoin is what incentivizes the energy consumption which as a side effect also secures the network.

That's fine as long as you also recognize the dangers of *not* growing the blocksize limit to match external factors like user growth. That also will result in a significant and dangerous change to the way the network currently operates. With so much value at stake, we have to take the most conservative option, the option that keeps the network operating as closely as possible to the way it does today. Anyone who wants to have significant changes, like allowing blocks to fill up, has the onus on them to justify it. I haven't seen any simulations or other rigorous testing from 1Mb proponents that show how the network will function with full blocks.

Breadwallet uses this today with the iOS keychain service and Touch ID authentication. We're also working on an android version that uses it. We will never release a product that we believe exposes users to malware theft.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:51:02
Of course we would never export private keys. We will never release a product that we believe puts funds at risk of malware theft. This is also why we're still iOS only at the moment.
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:35:35
direct quote from the paper: “Actually, iOS does not have this issue, because its keychain does not support the ACL at all: every app is only allowed to access its own item and there is no flexibility to let a group of apps share secrets except those by same developers.”
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:16:47
Also, there are two competing considerations. Other wallet software and computing platforms are not built to the same security standards. If people share a seed between different types of devices and wallet software, they expose themselves to much greater risk of security holes and bugs. That said, we also want to avoid lockin by using an open standard. We think using the default bip32 structure is a nice compromise. There are tools available to recover funds in the event of breadwallet being unavailable, yet users have less of an incentive to expose themselves to increased risk.

I'm pleased to announce that breadwallet is now listed on [bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet]( (under mobile)

unencrypted itunes backups still keep the keychain encrypted to the phone's pin+uuid, which is why you can only restore it to the same device. In fact, the apple docs say that only "passwords you enter into websites and some apps" are backed up, so I need to investigate exactly what that means vis-a-vis breadwallet.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:04:14
just make sure you know how to harden your system against malware. os x does not have app sandboxing and doesn't require code signing like iOS. Desktop wallets are not recommended for people who don't have strong knowledge of computer security.
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:27:27
If you can restore it across devices, it's no more secure than a desktop wallet. Your mac might be file vault encrypted, but you decrypt it and install software and updates to it all the time. If it's backed up to iCloud in a cross device way, then it's no more secure than a web wallet. The backup phrase is how your wallet is protected against losing or breaking your phone.
@_date: 2014-06-30 04:47:36
it most certainly does. apps are not sandboxed and code signatures are not verified, so every app has access to every other app's keychain data, any app can log touches/keystrokes, and every app has access to every other apps filesystem data.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:55:20
That's a common and intuitive sounding explanation, but doesn't stand up to scrutiny. The amount of money that's being presently transacted is equal to the amount of goods and services being presently exchanged at any given time, but this doesn't tell you anything about the price of any particular store of value such as bitcoin. A store of value gets it's price from the current demand to hold purchasing power in reserve, and the speculation that others will increasingly standardize on that particular store of value as opposed to other standards.
@_date: 2014-10-14 08:12:56
That's right. The way bitcoin works, anyone can send coins to any address, even ones that no one has the keys to.
If anyone transfers coins to your receive address and you've wiped the wallet from your phone, the only way to spend them is to restore the wallet with your backup phrase.
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:00:22
receiving bitcoin is much easier than getting a bank account, and much cheaper than a pre-paid cc that costs $5-7 and is difficult to fully use without leaving a small amount on the card. you can potentially earn some bitcoin without even having to leave the house. even with something like paypal you have to spend 10minutes setting up your account and entering personal details.
it's those small conveniences that add up to making the legacy financial system... well... antiquated.

It will show the local currency amount as you type. I developed the project to promote the use of bitcoin. This was a design choice to make it as easy as possible for people to start thinking in bits. You're not sending GBP or USD, you're sending bits.

I agree, but the question then is what makes you think your judgement about those economic decisions is better than that of the individuals involved. By inflating the money supply you distort those incentives in ways that individuals wouldn't choose left to their own devices and an impartial unit of account that didn't influence one way or the other.

Again, make sure if you use a desktop wallet that you're a security expert who knows how to harden your system. A malware hardened system with code signatures, full filesystem hardware encryption by default and app sandboxing like you get with an iPhone is far safer for the typical user.
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:10:19
2FA is a marginal improvement, but if you sign in using 2FA from a system not secured against malware (like any popular desktop operating system), then there can be bitcoin stealing malware sitting there waiting for you to sign in with your fancy authentication before hijacking your session and robbing you.
This is going to be serious problem as bitcoin grows into a major world currency and becomes the most lucrative target for all hackers everywhere, far above turning people's computers into spambots or stealing credit card info.
This was the primary reason I started the [breadwallet]( project, so regular people with no understanding of security can safely and conveniently use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:15:19
Yes, for any computing device you use, you must trust the manufacturer at some level. Even if the firmware is open source, you have to trust the hardware that runs it.
My goal is provide the best security I can using a comparatively secure, popular platform that's already in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. But it's not perfect by any means.
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:49:55
What a wallet does is manage your private keys for digitally signing transactions. The bitcoins are actually managed by the Bitcoin network. [breadwallet]( stores your keys in the iPhone secure enclave and is the first iPhone wallet that connects directly to the Bitcoin network instead of going through another server. It also gives you a backup phrase to write down in case your phone is lost or broken, so you can restore your wallet on another device. Your keys are actually generated right from the backup phrase.

You will also need to lock down your android device. Turn on filesystem encryption (you must have a long unlock password to do this), disable extra services, never install any other apps, make sure you keep it up to date with timely security patches, so you won't be able to use a carrier customized phone that doesn't get timely updates. Also make sure your device is one of the ones that have hardware backed encryption. Knowing how to harden an android device is critical if you're going to store any amount of digital cash on it that you wouldn't want stolen.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:30:31
I agree that ios security is not perfect, though it would take a remote jailbreak exploit to compromise your keys. Hopefully any such security hole would be patched quickly with apples typically high patch deployment rates.
Unfortunately paper wallets with confusing change address implications and offline Linux systems aren't an option for the vast majority of people who are still to adopt Bitcoin.

He logged in from a desktop system using his iPhone for 2fa, so any of those I mentioned are possible. The only one that he specifically denied was clicking a phishing link from his email, but it still could have been a phishing link in, say, a google ad if he typed the local bitcoins domain name into the search box instead of the url bar, or who knows what.
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:22:47
Yes, this is the "app coin" concept, and it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of money. The value of the company isn't tied to the token unless the company makes some contractual guarantee to make such a tie, say by promising to distribute dividends to token holders or by purchasing the tokens with profits. At that point the tokens would literally be digital stock shares.
Bitcoin is not a company and makes no such guarantees. It is a pure monetary commodity. The only reason it has a non-zero price is because people choose to hold it as a store of value. The network may provide other types of value, but that value doesn't have any direct effect on the price. Only people choosing to hold it does, as with any monetary commodity.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:40:20
One of the biggest problems with cold storage is that non-experts don't understand how change addresses work, which has led to many instances of lost funds.
A better option (in my biased opinion) is to create an HD wallet on a secure device like with breadwallet, write down the backup phrase and a receive address, and then wipe the wallet from the device. breadwallet makes you type in your backup phrase to wipe the wallet to ensure against transcription errors.
@_date: 2014-10-12 22:40:20
I co-authored BIP39, and came up with the english wordlist and checksum scheme. The part about converting straight from the mnemonic to the seed was introduced late to meet the needs of trezor like devices that may not be able to hold the word list. I agree it's less than ideal. The original design that I worked on was, as you suggest, just an encoding. That was my preference as well.

I built [breadwallet]( specifically to make bitcoin simple and safe for people who dont have a strong understanding of computer security. It's the first wallet for iOS that connects to the Bitcoin network instead of trusting a server that could get hacked or go down, and iOS is the best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms. iOS devices are also hardware encrypted by default protecting your funds even if your phone is stolen.
Paper wallets are secure from hacking, but it's easy to lose funds if you don't understand how change addresses work. They're more for holding large amounts for people who already understand bitcoin well.
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:41:16
[breadwallet]( will continue to implement more privacy features. It was the first SPV mobile wallet to implement HD so each tx uses a new address. We're also working on adding merge avoidance techniques and more sophisticated coin selection. Stealth addreses or similar feature will be also be added. We've had requests for onename integration, but without stealth addresses that would be a privacy disaster. It's still a relatively new project but we're taking privacy seriously.

a local bitcoins account is a hosted web wallet, so there are dozens of potential attack vectors that are a lot easier to pull off than hacking someone's iPhone. SMS is totally insecure, and desktop malware can just wait until after you authenticate with 2fa, or could be a hack of the local bitcoins server, inside job, phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, you name it.

The pin has to be very easy to remember. There are letters under each digit if you want to remember as letters. Pin attempts are limited by hardware. If you want stronger security you can enable a long passcode on the device itself. If an attacker can unlock the device after a reboot, then they have a lot more potential attack vectors to steal funds.
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:51:46
Trezor is a very cool device. I worked with the trezor guys to develop the BIP39 backup phrase standard. Just be sure you know how to harden the host system against malware since it has to trust it for blockchain data and the payment address.
If you want a malware hardened device that does SPV verification of blockchain data and x.509 cert/signature validation of payment requests from merchants that support payment protocol, then you'll want an iOS bitcoin network client. The first is [breadwallet](
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:37:55
Keychain items for breadwallet are marked "this device only" so the backups are strongly encrypted to the device itself.
I suppose its not technically correct that the keychain is stored *in* the secure enclave, rather the keychain is only accessible *through* the secure enclave, according to apples security white paper. It's in an encrypted store that can only be decrypted by the secure enclave.

I was going to look at the code, but apparently it's not open source? I wouldn't trust a non-open source bitcoin wallet.

For Tiger it's just another payment rail. They never see your bitcoin. They don't want it, they only care about USD in their bank account. (I don't recall tiger ever mentioning they plan to hold onto any btc like patrick bryne of overstock is) When you spend btc, you're effectively selling it to another bitcoin aficionado/trader who then pays tiger in USD, and that's awesome, but it doesn't make bitcoin money. It doesn't even make USD bank deposits money. They're only "money substitutes". Since bitcoin is cash, once almost everyone starts holding it instead of settling to something else, then I'll agree that it's attained the vaunted title of "money".

I designed [breadwallet]( to be the most secure wallet out there, especially for non-experts who have no clue about security.
Armory is great option for security experts who can harden a desktop against malware. iOS is better for everyone else with hardware AES encryption by default, and the locked down, sandboxed, signed-code-only security model to protect against malware. The secure enclave where keys are stored is even hardened against EM side-channel attacks.
breadwallet is the first bitcoin network client for iOS, so no server to get hacked or go down unlike server trusting wallets.
It even compares well with the security of dedicated hardware wallets that have to trust a potentially comprised host system for blockchain data and payment address. Breadwallet does SPV verification of blockchain data and x509 cert/signature validation of payment requests from merchants supporting payment protocol.

bits are better for new users. it only has two decimal places like every other currency on the planet, and we'll never need to change it again even if bits become the single world currency. I know it bugs old time bitcoin users, but you get used to it pretty quickly. 1500bits ~= 1usd right now.

Just remember every wallet and platform you type your backup phrase into significantly increases your risk of theft/loss. Most wallets are not built to the same security standards, and other platforms are far more vulnerable to malware.
We strongly recommend you never type your backup phrase anywhere unless restoring your wallet. That also includes password managers.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:59:58
Glad you like it. I feel pretty strongly that the community needs to move together to the new standard denomination. It's only long time bitcoiners who don't like it (change is always uncomfortable), and they'll hold back adoption by confusing new users if they don't switch. Two decimal places is a lot more comfortable and intuitive for the 99.9% that haven't yet adopted Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:01:44
pin attempts are also recorded in the keychain so they are remembered if the app is reinstalled. after 3 attempts you get locked out for 1minute, then 10min, then an hour. In the next update it will just wipe the wallet after a 24hr lockout on the 8th attempt in case the user lost both their pin and backup phrase. Also even if the phone is stolen while unlocked, the theif can't jailbreak it without the pin since it will lock when it reboots.
I stored the seed on the keychain because that's the safest place for it. I could additionally encrypt it to key kept in the app's filesystem that would get deleted if the app is deleted, but as you suggest I think that would probably lead to more bitcoin being lost from accidental app deletion by people who lose or don't write down their backup phrase.

I agree, but if you have to bruteforce the entire reduced keyspace, then isn't it still as strong as that reduced key strength? (32bits in your example) Unless there was a mathematical relationship between the reduced keyspace and the ecdsa curve, I don't see how it would reduce the work needed to find the private key. You have to either guess the key which takes up to 2^32 attempts, or you have to compute the discrete log which takes about 2^half-the-parameter-length calculations. Is there some way to get a further optimization beyond 2^32 if we assume the hash is good and has a pseudo-random distribution within the ecdsa keyspace?

The case you bring to dispute mediation. The judge, who gets business from a reputation for fairness, decides the case. The way I understand it, the prospect of becoming a social pariah and being seen as untrustworthy to enter into contracts or do business with is more than enough to compel compliance, similar to how credit card companies compel you to pay by threat of ruining your credit, despite the fact we have no debtors prisons any longer. Then add to that the possibility that anyone can use force against you without being seen as an aggressor themselves.
Whatever the explanation, it seems to work just fine.

I still think you're not quite getting the problem. Dashline mentioned they are vulnerable to malware that targets your local encrypted store. They said it's unlikely, but it becomes a *lot* more likely with a direct monetary incentive like digital cash.
You also keep mentioning 2fa. The way to do 2fa is with key splitting (really!) Each key is the equivalent of a factor, as I've already explained a few times. One key can be in an online service, password encrypted, one on the phone and on paper, and the third is also on paper in another location for if you forget your password or the online service goes down.

* 1) install breadwallet
* 2) tap "new wallet"
* 3) write down "backup phrase"
* 4) tap receive address and send it to yourself as email or message
* 5) go to settings and "start/restore another wallet" to wipe the wallet from the phone
Now you have a cold storage only HD wallet, and you're even defended against the potential of malware having been on the device when you created the wallet. Of course without the wallet on the device, you won't get new receive addresses after each receive, but when you're ready to spend you don't have to worry about backing up change addresses. They're included in the backup phrase.
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:09:49
I spent considerable effort designing the new wallet flow to educate and encourage users to write down and safeguard their backup phrase. It explains what the phrase is for (restore your wallet on another device if this one is lost or broken) but it has a "remind me later" button as the only option unless you spend enough time on the backup screen to write it down. Then it doesn't mention it again until you receive your first transaction, when it says "congratulations, you have bitcoin. The next step is to write down your backup phrase in case your device is ever lost or broken". You have to tap a checkbox that says "I wrote it down" to disable occasional reminders thereafter. There is also a large warning before showing the phrase explaining not to let others see it or take a screenshot.

The operative word there is "password". They are not intended for securing digital cash. Digital cash requires a much higher standard of security. Think dedicated tamper resistant hardware like the iOS secure enclave or smart card secure element. If you type it into a password manager and you have malware on your desktop, your money is gone. If you click the wrong email attachment or approve the wrong app update, the next time you open your password manager your money is gone. Web service passwords just aren't that critical, you can recover if someone hacks your email or even your bank account. If they hack your bitcoin wallet, you have zero recourse.

The blockchain is public. What you need is something private with 128bits of entropy. Anything will do. If you're worried about losing something physical that represents this private information, then you'll have to keep it in your head and risk forgetting it instead. There is no way around it. You need a *private* key. The form this key takes isn't important as any form can easily be converted to a bitcoin private key using a hash function.

Durability and identifiability are other desirable monetary properties, and of course most importantly, you want to hold the commodity that everyone else is going to want to hold as a store of value when you're ready to trade. You are correct that picking what everyone else picks is the most important thing, and you can still have useful money even if it has poor monetary properties, so long as it has the network effect of acceptance. The point I'm making is that monetary properties are desirable and important. The better monetary properties that the money has, the better it works as money. People used to use strings of seashells as money, but when metal working was developed people switched to metals because their properties were better. More scarce (meaning closer to a fixed supply), more durable, more fungible, more transportable, etc...
I'm upvoting your comments BTW since you are making useful arguments.

Software can be verified if it's open source and uses deterministic builds. I'm working on figuring out deterministic builds for [breadwallet]( so independent third parties can verify that the app store distribution was built from the open source project without modification. And I also verify that app store binary matches what I signed and uploaded with my developer account, so we know no apple employee slipped anything in.
Hardware is more problematic, but that problem is the same for whatever hardware you use to authenticate yourself to a custodial account service.

Let me try one other explanation. People expend resources and capital in gold mining and gold related businesses because gold is valued, not the other way around. The same is true of bitcoin mining and bitcoin related businesses.
The vast majority of gold's value results from the fact that it is desired as a store of value. People the world over standardized on gold as a store of value because it had the best monetary properties of any material available at the time. You want to hold the thing that everyone else wants to hold, and whatever gets chosen as that standard becomes money. This is what is happening to bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is no more a "business" than is gold.

Satoshi chose a (eventually) fixed supply quite intentionally. He wanted to make a digital commodity that embodied all the desirable monetary properties as perfectly as possible.
Scarcity and durability are both desirable monetary properties, which necessarily means a supply that doesn't increase or decrease when taken to the logical extreme. All else being equal, people will tend to prefer a monetary commodity that is both scarce and durable. Of course all else is rarely ever equal, so the network effect of how many other  people want to use it as store of value will often trump good monetary properties, which explains why people choose to use fiat money.

You're thinking about it like a programmer. For human speech it's more important to have an intuitive association with the word "bitcoin" than it is to remove ambiguity.

even massively deflated, fractional reserve banking practices don't work with bitcoin. bank runs happen at internet speeds and there's no lender of last resort to print more bitcoin for a bailout. with a hard money monetary system, you have to actually produce more value for society than you consume to profit. you can't do it through political connections with a central bank.

Writing it down on paper that you keep in a safe place is the right solution.

precisely. if your wallet seed is included in off-device digital backups, you're going to get robbed. the correct way to do it is to specify that the keychain item is only saved on the device, and have the user write it down on paper that they can keep physical control of, in case of device loss or failure.

Apps are sandboxed from eachother requiring a remote jailbreak exploit for malware to access other apps file system data. Also the document is outdated. App filesystem data is now hardware encrypted by default. Also breadwallet uses the iOS keychain for private key data, and uses secure memory practices such as wrapping sensitive objects in autorelease blocks and wiping sensitive memory prior to deallocation.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:40:47
The keychain data is stored in the secure enclave. Apple claims the secure enclave is secure even if the kernel is compromised, but that would mean jailbroken phones would loose access to the keychain. I haven't had a chance yet to try out the new 8.1 jailbreak to see if that's really the case.

We designed [breadwallet]( with the goal of making it the most secure wallet out there.
iPhone is the best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms, and devices are hardware encrypted by default, giving you strong protection even if your phone is physically stolen.
it's is also the first wallet for that platform that connects directly to the bitcoin network, so no servers to hacked or go down.
We think the security level compares well with dedicated hardware wallets, since keys are stored in the secure enclave which apples claims is secure even if the kernel is compromised, and the wallet performs cryptographic verification of blockchain data and payment requests right on the malware hardened device, which the current generation of hardware wallets have to trust a host computer for.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:54:12
It's true that's a possibility, but security is still cumulative in that the more blocks that get added ontop of your historical transaction, the more difficult that attack becomes, no matter how difficult those new blocks are. It doesn't become easier if future blocks have a lower difficulty, the difficultly of rewriting history just increases at a slower rate.
Even if you move your coins among your own addresses, a rewrite could only reverse the move to yourself, still leaving them in your control (assuming you don't lose your keys). It's only new transactions to you from another party who's security is directly affected by the current difficulty, and those are the very same parties paying transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:43:01
The only way to store an encryption key digitally in a way that's safe is with a hardened, secure hardware device, like the iPhone secure enclave. As soon as you store it online or on a non-secure device, then it needs to be strongly encrypted... with an encryption key. So then where do you keep *that* key? Wherever you keep that key, you can just put your wallet backup there directly since it's also just an encryption key.
The last option you mention is multi-sig. In that case you still need to store another private key in case that multi-sig service goes down, gets hacked, gets asked to freeze your account, etc...
multi-sig is still very useful to protect against a situation where your iPhone gets hacked, it gives you time to move your funds out and/or limits how much the attacker can steal.

That's bitcoin's scheduled *monetary* inflation rate. The monetary inflation rate for fiat currencies is even higher than that because they're targeting a *price* inflation rate of 2-3%. That means the monetary base has to grow 2-3% *faster* than the economy. The bitcoin economy is growing at something like 1000% annually, so *price* inflation in bitcoin in that case ends up being -988% assuming an adoption rate of 1000%, and that's exactly what we've seen.

No, that's what I meant by "holding it". You hold USD (if you're in the states) because you speculate that others will want to hold it in the future and so they will be willing accept it in exchange for goods and services in the future. That's what money is. It's collective value isn't equal to the good and services currently on the market, it's value is equal to the demand to hold purchasing power in reserve for future use. If no one wants to save and everyone instead spends everything they get as quickly as they can, prices rise (the value of the money goes down). If everyone gets rid of bitcoin as fast as they can instead of holding it to make purchases in the future, it's value will approach zero. It's value comes from the demand to hold it.

If you want to use bitcoin safely on an insecure device like you do with your banking app, you would need something like a multi-sig service paired with your wallet that runs sophisticated anti-fraud algorithms and offers bitcoin theft insurance, like your bank does for your fiat deposits. You will also have to go through the inconvenience of reviewing your spending history, filing a timely claim and wiping/replacing your phone whenever a theft happens.
If you want to safely use bitcoin without paying for a service like that, you'll have to secure your private keys somehow, like with a secure device.

Encrypted backups to the desktop are a little bit better, at least until bitcoin becomes a more popular and lucrative target for hackers. But it's not the default, so most users are still exposed. And you still encrypt those backups with a user chosen password that is almost always easy to crack, so it's only as secure as your desktop system. Users suck at securing desktop systems.

If you have an iPhone, I built [breadwallet]( specifically to help make bitcoin simple and safe for people who don't know the first thing about computer security. It's the first wallet for iOS that connects to the bitcoin network instead of trusting a server. iOS devices are hardware encrypted by default, protecting you if your phone is stolen, and it's the best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms.
If you use a web wallet like blockchain or a hosted wallet like coinbase, make sure you know how to harden your computer against malware. They don't offer insurance if you get robbed by accessing your wallet from an infected device, and remember 2fa won't help if there's malware on the device you use after you've signed in with 2fa.

@_date: 2014-10-15 21:21:24
I disagree. The third party needs a way to authenticate you as the account owner. If that can be done securely, then just use that secure method to authenticate yourself as the funds owner to the bitcoin network directly.
For example, 2fa can be achieved through multisig. A hardware keyfob device can be used to hold bitcoin keys directly. A  secure smartphone with pin can run a Bitcoin wallet directly. Involving a trusted third party only increases risk. None of these custodial Bitcoin accounts offer insurance against end user security breaches. How could they? Whatever measures they offer to defend against breaches can be implemented without giving custodial control.

Nope, you just have all your wallet funds spread out across a bunch of different addresses. When you spend, it uses the balance from one or more of them.

iOS is not bug free, you are certainly correct. The security advantage over android is that you need a remote jailbreak exploit to install malware, where as android doesn't enforce code signing, so there are many more vectors for malware to get installed. Also with the current android version, you need to enable a long unlock password to turn on filesystem encryption which pretty much nobody does, and not all devices have hardware backed encryption, while iOS devices are all hardware encrypted by default, protecting you in the event of physical theft. And most android devices don't receive timely security updates due to carrier customization and apathy.
As I mentioned in other comments, I really want to do an android version and am exploring options for how to do so without subjecting users to the risk of malware theft. The most promising avenue looks to be installing a wallet on the trusted platform module which has direct screen access, and bypasses the main OS entirely.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:52:44
No plans at the moment for password encrypted backup phrases. My investigation leads me to believe this will result in more bitcoin loss overall from forgotten passwords. Also the key stretching in the standard is very weak so that it can be performed by low power devices.
A better solution is 2-of-3 key splitting. Then one key can be password encrypted and stored online. The other two can be written down and kept in different locations so that if any one is lost or compromised or the password for the third is forgotten, funds are still accessible and secure.

you can download to app to iTunes on your desktop, and I think you can use Xcode command line tools to strip the app signature, but I haven't tried it yet. gitian uses a virtual machine to compile in to make sure everything is identical, but hopefully you can get away with just using the same version of Xcode on the same version of os x on the same type of hardware.

The miners are incentivized with tokens, but the tokens are still a pure monetary commodity. They convey no ownership of network resources for instance. Their only value results exclusively from the demand to hold them. They are money (or at least have the potential of becoming money). A stock on the other hand has value as a result of the company assets it conveys ownership of, and the expectation that those assets will be used to generate future profits which will at some point be dispersed to stock holders. 
A bitcoin or app coin token has no tie to the assets that compose the network or their future profits. The value of a bitcoin is not related the value of the network. It is purely due to the demand to hold the commodity. Comparing bitcoin to a stock is just as confused as saying that owning gold is somehow the same as investing in gold mining operations or mints or bullion exchange businesses.

Your couple of tweaks have the side effect of completely destroying the security model of the phone and making you wide open to malware attack.


A non-jailbroken pinlocked iOS device is far more secure than any desktop, web, or android device for storing digital cash. Even a dedicated hardware wallet that doesn't have a pin will let you down in the event of physical theft.


If you jailbreak your phone, you can't safely use it for holding digital cash. Many people don't understand this which is dangerous for the whole bitcoin community. If normal users can't secure their bitcoin and frequently get robbed, it will hurt all of us.


And r/bitcoin posts about people getting their bitcoins stolen is a weekly occurrence. breadwallet won't harass you if used properly, and the warnings don't prevent you from trying it out to see if it's worth securing your device to use.


breadwallet is built to a higher standard of security than any existing bitcoin wallet. Even the satoshi client relies on users being able secure a desktop system which is completely unreasonable for average users. Android is also far more susceptible to malware theft, and other iOS wallets rely on trusted servers which can be hacked. breadwallet doesn't. If you use it with a jailbroken phone, you're no more secure than any of those other solutions. If you insist on a lower standard of security for the sake of convenience, please use one of them.

You can't stop them. People care about convenience, not security. It's incredibly challenging just to encourage people to actually write down their backup phrase on paper instead trying to take screenshots (visible to every other app) or putting it in their password manager (reducing security to the level of a web wallet)
People are going to access their bitcoin from their mobile devices. This is a given. We can implement automated fraud detection algorithms using multi-sig, we can use secure hardware chips embedded in devices like the TPM, we can use secret splitting to protect the paper backup of your wallet seed from home invasion. There are ways to get better, and we'll be building them. Host trusting hardware wallets, and locked down smartphones are the best available today. It's far better than the desktop, web wallets and hosted wallets that are currently popular, and it will get even better in the years to come. It has to.

It's a wrapper around a web wallet. It's certainly an improvement over accessing your wallet from a desktop machine. Make sure you don't have your wallet id in your desktop browser cache, or desktop malware can find it, grab the encrypted wallet, and then crack the password offline. Make sure you *never* type your wallet password into a desktop machine.
If you only ever use it from iOS, then the main security difference is that it's a "server-trusting" wallet, so if their servers get hacked you can be tricked into sending too much money. And if their servers go down, you loose access to your funds (unless you import your backups into another wallet). Your keys are also stored on their server encrypted only by your password, so if their server is breached, it would be a simple matter of cracking your password offline. Your password almost certainly has less entropy than the 128bits of your breadwallet backup phrase.
Also since it's using a web window in the app, there's the possibility that a safari exploit could lead to a wallet breach. Breadwallet stores the wallet seed on the keychain in the secure enclave, while blockchain decrypts your keys with javascript in the browser, a much less secure environment.
It's the difference between something that compares with hardware wallet levels of security, and a web wallet. A web wallet is fine for small amounts that you don't mind risking.

You are correct. It is this property of having a fixed supply that is generally referred to as "scarcity", and what I was referring to. I suppose "perfectly scarce" would literally mean it doesn't exist at all as opposed to "no more can be created"

The update I submitted to the app store will detect if it's running on a jailbroken device and warn the user that their funds are not secure since the device's security features have been disabled. PIN code is the next feature I will be adding in the update following this one.
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:25:04
Your point is well taken, but I'm at a loss how else to clearly and concisely communicate the notion that an SPV wallet doesn't *trust* any server for blockchain data, and doesn't *rely* on any particular server or set of servers that could go offline. As long as you have an internet connection and the bitcoin network continues to function, you have complete and exclusive control of your funds.

If you enter three different incorrect pins, you will get locked out for a time, and there is an option to reset the pin using your backup phrase.
@_date: 2014-11-28 01:43:06
That's not something I imagine typical users would ever do, but it's a feature we're exploring turning on by default as a privacy enhancement for all breadwallet users, with a fallback to current behavior of connecting to random nodes in the event the private nodes are unavailable.
@_date: 2014-08-14 05:09:10
Hive is a nice app. They even use the BIP39 mnemonic backup phrase standard the Trezor guys and I came up with.
The main difference is that it relies on trusted servers for transaction and balance data. It is not a bitcoin network client like breadwallet. If those servers get hacked you could be tricked into sending too much money, or if they go down, your money is stuck. Also mobile safari is a lot more complex and susceptible to security holes.
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:50:38
Interesting, it requires the full input transactions before signing? I had thought it only signed the tx it was given after displaying output addresses and amounts. Very cool.
Re: key extraction - I'm not sure how the common crypto library handles that situation internally so I'd like to test it. It gives you a read only data object when you request a key, so I suspect that won't be in a memory dump, however that data has computations performed on it so there may be sensitive info in cpu caches and the like.
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:45:07
You are espousing the chartalist theory of money. Bitcoin has already demonstrated the falseness of this idea. The official stamp on it's face (or the decree it represents) is not what gives value to a thing, or causes it to become money.

The main concern I have is that people have lost funds with single address paper wallets due to confusion about how change addresses work.
A safer method is to create a deterministic wallet offline, write down the backup phrase and receive address, and then wipe the wallet from the device.

Just make sure you know how to harden your system against malware!
@_date: 2014-11-17 04:36:11
If it's portable, it's only encrypted to your password. Users are notoriously bad at choosing strong passwords. You're thinking of bitcoin like it's some login credential that you can recover from if it gets hacked. It's not. It's digital cash, and requires a much higher standard of security. Your keys are stored in the secure enclave which is a custom, tamper resistant secure hardware chip, and then also off device with your backup phrase on paper. If there's a cross device backup stored on your desktop, you've reduced your security to the level of any other desktop wallet, vulnerable to desktop malware that either cracks your weak password offline or waits for you to type it in.
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:06:48
Creating the wallet offline is good advice, but at some point you'll want to spend your money. Even if you do the whole dual system offline signing thing, you have to take care that the online system doing the payment protocol verification of the payee address isn't infected. A common bitcoin stealing malware trick is to change any bitcoin addresses presented to the user.

I completely agree. That was the motivation for my own [work]( I wanted a real SPV bitcoin wallet for iOS, since it's the best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms. The secure enclave in iphone5s and newer (where the keychain is stored) is a full on trusted execution environment that apple claims is secure even if the kernel is compromised.
I certainly don't trust myself to secure a desktop system. That pretty much requires a team of security experts.
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:15:28
You will be able to copy to and from addresses from you history with the update currently in app review. Additional detailed transaction information is coming soon.
Having to enter amounts in bits was a design decision. I know it's annoying the first few times you do it, but it will benefit bitcoin in the long run as it encourages people to start thinking in bits.
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:53:09
I was actually thinking about letting you see the send and receive views without entering a pin, but then the pin would be required to view history or send money, and maybe a lock symbol instead of the balance that you could tap, after which you'd enter the pin and it would change to the balance like it shows now.

Anything less than 128bits reduces your security. Anything more certainly won't hurt but doesn't give much advantage since bitcoin uses a 256bit ecdsa curve and the strength of an ecdsa signature is about half the curve length.

Excellent, glad to hear there's measures to detect and warn about spoofing.
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:28:38
When you generate a key from the entropy, you run it through some hash function to get a pseudo random output of the correct length. If the strength of the signature is equal to the amount of entropy used to generate the key, wouldn't it be equally difficult to guess the key as to reverse the signature? Assuming the key generation hash is non-reversible I wouldn't think theres any possibility to use the reduced key space to aid in reversing the signature, but Im no cryptographer. Is there any liturature on the subject?

that's helpful if you know how to secure a desktop computer. almost no one does though. if you've ever installed a ticker app on your desktop for instance, then you can't use that computer with a web wallet. plenty of reddit stories of people getting robbed that way. even if you delete the ticker you can't trust the computer anymore. 
and you still have the problem of browser exploits. in a few years robbing wallets will by way more lucrative than creating spam bots or stealing credit card info. current desktop security just won't cut it.

Technically iOS isn't a general purpose computing platform. It can only run code signed by apple.
People are going to do whatever's most convenient. As wallet developers we have to work with the assumption that people are going to put their life savings on the device and be absolutely paranoid and fanatical about protecting it. As I mentioned, breadwallet compares favorably to the security of a dedicated hardware wallet, since it's running SPV and BIP70 verification on the hardened device. Your private keys are only ever stored in the secure enclave except briefly when a transaction is signed. The secure enclave is even hardened against EM-side-channel attacks unlike the current generation of hardware wallets. Your backup phrase allows you to restore you balance and tx history on another device if your phone is lost or broken. It would take a remote jailbreak exploit to steal the wallet seed, and any such breach would be quickly patched by apple with their typically high patch distribution rates.
I'm also investigating the use of the trusted platform module which is built into most android devices to make an android wallet with equal or better levels of security to iOS.
@_date: 2014-09-14 19:15:27

Don't use breadwallet on jailbroken phones. Any jailbreak app can see every other app's keychain data. It's probably fine for playing around with pocket change, but if the warning is annoying it's because you're trying to use it.

They're the only popular devices that are hardware encrypted by default to protect your wallet in the case of physical theft, and the only one that requires all code to be signed which significantly reduces the threat of malware. A locked down device is exactly what you want for holding bitcoin.
I'm looking into ways of doing an android version without subjecting users to the risk of malware theft, possible using the trusted platform module with direct screen access.
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:43:43
Bitcoin uses ECDSA signatures on a 256bit curve. The encryption strength is about n/2 for eliptic curves, so 128bits. The breadwallet backup phrases also have 128bits of entropy, so if you made them stronger you wouldn't really be increasing your overall security by any significant amount. That's why I went with 128bits.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:19:06
I would love to do an android version. We're hoping to build one that runs in trustzone so we can bring bitcoin to android users without subjecting them to the risk of malware theft. As you may have heard, android has a something of a malware problem. Not quite as bad as desktop OSes but bad enough I wouldn't recomend keeping private keys on it unless you're an android security expert who knows how to harden it.
Bitcoin stealing malware is already a significant portion of all the malware being discovered today and Bitcoin is still tiny.
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:12:24
This is true, and the wallet takes care to explain this to the user so they know to write it down on paper and keep it safe.
A planned feature is 2-of-3 key splitting. One key can then be stored online protected by a password. So then the password is needed in addition to the original backup phrase, but the user also gets a second backup phrase to keep in a second location in case they forget their password or the online service goes down or if the phone and first backup phrase are both destroyed in a fire or something.
@_date: 2014-06-24 06:49:19
That was the original question in this thread. My thinking right now is that showing the local currency amount updated instantly as you type in bits is only a slight inconvenience, and it makes people start thinking in bits. Most of the time you don't enter the amount manually anyway, it's already in the qr or url, so even if you really hate it, you don't have to do it that often. It's a subtle way get people to start thinking of and treating bitcoin like a real currency, including store of value and a unit of account, not just a payment system.

If you're in the US, you're the last person to ever need bitcoin. You probably have several bank accounts, a dozen credit cards, a driver's license if you want to prove your identity, access to loans, you probably even have a brokerage account or two, and to top it all off, your local currency by happy coincidence is the world reserve currency.
Now imagine you live in a cash based society with no access to credit, and that cash's value is spiraling toward zero out of control like in argentina and venezuela. It's dangerous and difficult to use gold or other currencies because of capital controls designed to prop up the failing local currency, not to mention street criminals. You have a cell phone and internet though, that's the most important thing after food and shelter, even more important than electricity or running water according to most of the people in your society.
Now, being in the US, having some extra investable income, knowing that sooner or later significant portions of the world population are going to adopt bitcoin, and knowing there's a fixed supply, maybe it would be prudent to buy a few just in case. You'll help grow bitcoin and add to the stable pool of savers that give any store of value stability and value, making it more useful for further savers.

the wallet seed is not included in any digital backups. it's on the keychain as an on-device-only item. the user writes down their (generated) backup phrase on paper where they can keep physical control of it, in case of device loss or failure.
if your phone is stolen, the phone is encrypted to your pin+uuid, so the wallet is reasonably secure even then, which is better than even a dedicated hardware wallet that doesn't have a pin.

Everyone says to only keep spending change on your mobile, but where else are you going to keep your wealth? Regular people can't use paper wallets, they'll screw it up and lose funds, and it's horribly inconvenient.

You need hardware wallet level security, and the only way to approach that today on android is the way I described.

malware is the most likely remote attack vector regardless of who the attacker is.
@_date: 2014-10-12 07:17:56
Yes, but not on by default. You have to enable a long password unlock to turn it on, and the device needs hardware backed encryption (not all do) or it's just a matter of cracking the user chosen unlock password.
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:26:00
With a password that length you must have had some trick to remember it, so write down whatever you can remember and the password cracker can work with that. They're suprisibgly good and taking advantage of all the memory tricks humans use. If it was actually a secure password, I.e. Random data, you would have written it down, so hopefully you can find it again. 
in that case, bitcoin stealing malware would typically just sit on your machine waiting for you to type in your password.

It's true that could happen, but as long as someone somewhere notices, news will spread quickly.
I believe Hive is using the same bip32 tree structure, so you can restore there, but the main thing is that the source is available so anyone can very easily make a tool to access funds for others to use if needed. I'm personally not that big a fan of wallet interoperability with seed phrases. Other wallets are not built to the same security standards, and the more wallets and devices you type your backup phrase into, the greater chance that one has a security hole or bitcoin stealing malware.
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:39:55
You are right that no computing device can be 100% safe, and offline is still the best way to defend agaisnt malware. It's just that it's not a realistic option for the vast majority of people who use money (i.e. everyone), and can be dangerous for people who don't understand change addresses. Malware hardened devices are realistically what people are going to use for holding their funds, so we set out to make the safest wallet available on the most popular malware hardened platform out there.

Being created or occurring naturally isn't the important distinction, the important thing is it becomes a standard (and having great monetary properties is a prerequisite for everyone to standardize on it).

Well, with money, there's a strong network effect for everyone to choose the same commodity as a medium of savings. Other blockchains might work equally well, but only if everyone else collectively picks the same one as a store of value. This is not the case with company dividends. In fact it's the opposite, the more people who pick a particular stock, the more diluted the dividends with respect to the share price. The case of SSC was unique in that there were no dividends or any likely prospect for them, so it was nearly a pure trading bubble. Money is also a trading bubble, but one that becomes stable because everyone has to pick *something* to trade, not to use directly, but to trade away later to transfer purchasing power over time. Whatever everyone picks inflates like a bubble, and doesn't pop until everyone standardizes on some other savings medium. Thus we have gold being valued anomalously far above it's direct use value, like a bubble, but consistently for thousands of years.

Money is the standard medium of savings, the standard medium of exchange, the standard unit of account, and the most liquid commodity on the market.

breadwallet uses BIP70 payment protocol for merchants that support it, so it requests the payment details directly from the merchant over ssl and verifies the merchant identity using X.509 certificate and signature.
You are correct though that it is still vulnerable if a non-payment protocol request is scanned from an insecure desktop computer. (or if malware swaps out the payment protocol request for a non authorized fake request) I will consider adding a security warning for non-authorized requests once payment protocol becomes more wide spread.
It also occurs to me that hardware wallets need to trust an external source for address balance and transaction data. If malicious input data is supplied to the hardware wallet, it can be tricked into signing away a larger input amount than intended. This will necessarily be the case until hardware wallets can implement SPV.

This is precisely my point. We have to make the secure thing the most convenient thing so that people will do it. They have no tools to evaluate what's secure and what's not. Grandma clicks on any email attachment she's sent, and she needs to use money too.


No, millions of people have a pin on their phone because choosing a pin at setup *is* the most convenient thing to do, instead of trying to find that intentionally obscurely located "skip" button. The skip button is placed where your eye is least likely track to, and in a font and color that makes it blend in so that you have to hunt for it. They actually do user testing and research to make people less likely to use it.

Sorry for the issue. Rescanning can sometimes get stuck if you connect to a very slow node that doesn't completely stall. Improvements to help with this are already in the source for the next update. You don't have to reboot the phone though, you can just kill and restart the app.
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:07:26
I'm the author. 2fa stands for two factor authentication. A factor is something you have (like your phone), something you know (like your pin), or something you are (like your fingerprint). So technically it is 2fa since you need the phone and you need to know the pin.
However generally 2fa refers to how you authenticate yourself to some online service like a web wallet or hosted wallet. 2fa for an online service won't protect you if the device you access the service from after authenticating has bitcoin stealing malware on it. It can wait for you to do your fancy authentication and then hijack your session.
That's why I wanted to build a real bitcoin wallet that connects directly to the Bitcoin network for a locked-down, malware hardened, hardware encrypted platform like the iPhone. Breadwallet isn't an online service, it's a standalone Bitcoin wallet app. There are no breadwallet servers to authenticate yourself to, you are authenticating yourself directly to the Bitcoin network with your private keys stored safely in the iPhone secure enclave.

It's s new industry going through growing pains. Insurance, escrow, and other similar services can and are being implemented. There's nothing unique to bitcoin that prevents it, and its design even enables new ways of providing these services where the provider can't steal the funds.

I agree getting users to memorize or manually check things is a problem. A 4digit pin about the most you can expect, anything longer needs a recovery option. In a point of sale situation the terminal is a physical trust anchor so users are safer from switched payment addresses. For web purchases, using the smartphone browser and certificate pinning helps with malware and man-in-the middle attacks, and multisig providers can enforce blacklists and the like. It's not perfect but we have plenty of avenues to improve. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:09:13
Coinbase is a "hosted wallet". You don't actually have bitcoin in that case, what you have is a promise from coinbase for some bitcoin.
Also they don't offer insurance from malware theft if you use an infected device to login to your account, so it's not really any more secure than a web wallet.
Breadwallet is a real Bitcoin network client. Your phone connects to the Bitcoin network instead of some server that could get hacked or go down. And your keys are under your control on a device that is hardened against malware and even physical theft. You can restore from your backup phrase on another device if your phone is broken or lost/stolen
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:56:01
relevant to our conversation: 
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:58:05
I designed [breadwallet]( with the goal of making the safest wallet out there. It's hardware AES encrypted protecting you in the event of physical theft, and the iOS sandboxing/signed-code-only security model greatly reduces risk of malware theft. It also connects right to the bitcoin network, so there's no server to trust that might get hacked or go down. And your wallet is backed up with a phrase you write down in case your phone is ever lost or broken. It's "deterministic" so all your keys can be recovered from just the phrase.
Here's an r/Bitcoin post discussing the security of having an SPV client on iOS:
@_date: 2014-10-28 23:49:14
Depends on context
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:32:37
I'm not actually that hot on wallet interoperability. Other wallets aren't built to the same level of security that breadwallet is. The only thing that approaches it is a hardware wallet like trezor, but even that has to trust a potentially compromised host system for blockchain data and payment addresses, whereas breadwallet does SPV verification of blockchain data and x.509 cert/sig validation of BIP70 payment requests on a malware hardened platform. Also these early hardware wallets aren't using chips hardened against EM side channel attacks like the iPhone secure enclave.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:45:53
I don't think so. With proof-of-work, security is cumulative. Each new block increases the security of all the blocks and transactions that came before it, so you can't reduce the security of my holdings, you can only very marginally influence how much security is being constantly added.
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:35:24

This isn't even version 1, it's 0.3. It's going to get a lot better. There's no reason a bitcoin transaction can't be faster, smoother and simpler than say, a credit card transaction with square.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:48:50
 misunderstood, I will be adding a pin as stated in the readme at breadwallet.com. My concern was about the use cryptographically secure passwords in an attempt to make jailbroken phones secure. On a jailbroken phone this would be less secure than a brainwallet since touch/key logger malware could capture the password at input time.
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:04:00
A new address is created every time you receive funds, and the wallet keeps your private keys secure on the keychain in the iPhone secure enclave. They are all generated from your backup phrase. The idea is that eventually users shouldn't have to understand or deal with or even see bitcoin addresses anymore than they do with IP addresses.
It's an open source project, so support is through github for now, but we'll be adding more user friendly support for the app.
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:10:39
you could, but only if the wallet conforms to BIP32 and BIP39 standards, and uses the default BIP32 "tree" structure.
I think hive wallet is the only other wallet that does, but I haven't tried it. Also I don't recommend it as desktop, browser and android wallets don't have the same level of security as breadwallet on a non-jailbroken pin-locked iOS device. There are generally a lot more susceptible to malware or are not secure in the event of physical theft of the device.
@_date: 2014-09-27 17:12:38
Yes, that helps, as long as you got the payment address in the first place from a secure, trusted device and not a malware infected desktop computer.
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:38:43
Looks interesting, I like that you as the escrow 3rd party don't take custody of funds, only render a judgement. It's not 2-party escrow but a nice improvement on traditional 3rd party.

You're comparing the rate of increase in the bitcoin monetary base against the official-government stated rate of fiat *price* inflation. And without taking into account the fact that bitcoin is not yet even fully monetized. You also have to subtract the adoption rate of bitcoin from the monetary base inflation rate to find out the rate of change you'll see in your personal purchasing power. (hint, you're seeing massive price *deflation* year-over-year in bitcoin)

I think what you're missing is that in the legacy monetary system, the 1% can stay there without producing any value, through theft and monetary debasement. With bitcoin, being a hard money system that can't be debased, and much easier to defend against theft, then those who hold the coins will loose them when they spend them and not be able to get more without producing value that others are willing to voluntarily pay for.
@_date: 2014-10-25 01:52:41
Web and desktop wallets are vulnerable to malware theft. Bitcoin stealing malware is already a significant portion of the malware being found, and Bitcoin is still tiny. Hosted wallets like circle and coinbase don't insure you if you sign in with an infected device. For any serious amounts, you want a device hardened against malware like a locked down smartphone platform or hardware wallet. Be careful out there.

So according to the iOS security white paper: 
"Each keychain class has a “This device only” counterpart, which is always protected with the UID when being copied from the device during a backup, rendering it useless if restored to a different device."
breadwallet uses the "this device only" option, so your wallet seed is backed up when the phone is backed up, but strongly encrypted with a UID that is fabbed into a chip on the phone that even Apple doesn't know, so there's no risk of the encrypted backup getting stolen by malware and cracked offline. And if you lose the phone, that backup is useless.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:16:14
Offline paper wallets are still more secure if you have a strong understanding of how bitcoin transactions and change addresses work, but my goal for the project was to make the most secure hot wallet out there, and make bitcoin simple and safe even for people with no understanding of computer security. 
Your keys are stored in the iPhone secure enclave, and blockchain and payment request data is cryptographically verified right on the malware hardened device, unlike the current generation of hardware wallets that have to trust a host machine.
@_date: 2014-10-13 02:38:01

Thankfully with bitcoin, any kind of fraudulent trading of non existent coins will result in a "bank run" and institutional collapse at Internet speed.

@_date: 2014-10-24 20:06:42
in their current form, yes. If you have a secure module built into the device that has direct screen access, that's a possibility, but its mobile that will get that capability first, and mobile will gradually replace desktops over time anyway. Plus who's going to buy coffee with a desktop?
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:14:37
Desktop and web wallets aren't recommended for people who don't have a strong understanding of computer security.
I started the [breadwallet]( project specifically to solve the problem of making bitcoin safe, even for people who have no understanding of computer security. iOS is the best protected agaisnt malware of the popular platforms, and all devices are also hardware encrypted by default providing strong protection even if the phone is physically stolen.
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:54:27
That's a good argument in favor of bank deposits vs physical ownership of metal. Since bank deposits are just ledger entries they can be instantly transferred. Fiat currency however implies a "flexible" money supply, and I think this mis-feature is what he was referring to as being an advantage. Most people would consider a fully commodity backed bank deposit as "commodity money" even if it's technically a money substitute.
@_date: 2014-10-11 07:22:21
I think I'm just not understanding how you make a connection between reduced mining growth and "the bitcoin clergy backing off". That makes no sense. It's just rational actors acting rationally. If they care nothing about bitcoin and are just in it to earn a USD return, then those individuals will be dumping less bitcoin on the market. If they only care about acquiring bitcoin and nothing else, they will have more resources available for direct purchases. I'm not seeing how there is any downside to this.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:42:03
2048 is 2^11. 12 words would be 11*12 (132) bits of entropy, but the last 4 are a checksum, so it's 128bits. I chose 128 bits since bitcoin uses a 256bit ECDSA curve, and ECDSA strength is roughly n/2, so the seed is as small as possible without being the weakest part of the overall security scheme.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:05:47
"Hopefully through this we can begin to change the minds of bankers on their position around Bitcoin."
Their position is against all money services businesses, not just bitcoin, due to the huge regulatory compliance costs of providing banking services to those businesses. You won't be changing any minds unless you're addressing the cost and difficulty of compliance, but good luck in the competition!

your  breadwallet "seed" (your backup phrase) is only stored on the iOS keychain. It stays on the keychain and only gets loaded into memory briefly when you sign a transaction, and then it's immediately wiped from memory again. It never leaves the device, except of course when you write it down to back it up incase your phone gets lost or broken.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:53:18
bitpay and coinbase, the biggest payment processors have committed to switching to bits. we're all moving to that so we never need to change it again even if bits take over the global economy. also it has two decimal places like every other currency.
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:13:39
Trezor is great, but make sure you don't use it from a windows or os x desktop which could be infected with malware and modify your transactions prior to sending them to the trezor for signing. (or it could just modify the payment request before you even start the transaction)

The denomination is 'bits'. If you tap the balance it explains with a tip bubble.
I think I know what happened with the conversion rate. blockchain.info was down earlier, where it gets the exchange rate from. The default exchange rate is hard coded to $500 if it has never been able to get the rate from blockchain.info, but I forgot to change it to bits from bitcoins when I converted the rest of the app to bits.

On iOS, my project [breadwallet]( does not use servers for blockchain data (servers can get hacked or go offline). It connects to the bitcoin network, but only downloads the portion of the blockchain needed for your wallet, not the whole thing, so it syncs very quickly.

They even get to advertise about how great they are for doing it, building brand loyalty. What's not to like?

I readily admit Im not an android security expert. My impression is that the combination of the ability to side load apps and the poor uptake of patches is the main vector for android malware. So for instance any phone that isn't patched against fakeid is wide open to theft. I would need a way to detect if the host system is one that is likely to get timely patches. Also do you know how common fakeid/remote root level exploits are? Have there been many discovered? I'm only aware of one in the history of iOS, a JPEG decoder exploit in iOS 3
You are correct about hardware encryption, but defending against physical theft is important if we assume many users will put their life savings on the device (it might be the safest option for non-experts who wouldn't understand how to manage paper wallets)
As far as locking down sensors, that shouldn't be required for this application since the user isn't entering any sensitive data into the phone (except when restoring from backup phrase I suppose)
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:29:09
I agree with you that offline provides better security. I don't think regular people are going to setup offline systems in large numbers though, but I do plan to integrate with multi-sig services so that spending limits and eventually fraud detection algorithms can further protect large balances.

I plan to add tracking of url/qr labels and payment protocol objects, so you'll have more info about your transactions saved. I'm hesitant to add features that encourage address reuse though.

You may be right that he was only referring to relative lack of liquidity in Bitcoin when calling it a commodity, but I think it's more likely he was referring to its "inflexible" supply.
I also agree that money substitutes like bank deposits have value by fiat of the issuer, but the actual money itself was historically a commodity as with gold. The switch away from commodity money is general what is being referred to by the term "fiat money".
scarcity is an extremely critical monetary property. The giant stones of yap I think make the case that it is the most important property, since they had few others. So it's not fair to say that all else being equal is a useless statement. I do agree that acceptance (ie the network effect) is even more important than any of the monetary properties though.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:43:27
Security of your wallet seed is so critical. I don't recommend using it across wallets. The more different wallets and different platforms you enter your seed phrase into, the more chance there is that one of them has a security hole or the platform itself is infected with malware. Better to stick to one to reduce your exposure as much as possible.

malware is much less of a concern due to app sandboxing and the keychain security model (on non-jailbroken devices anyway, which is why it's a 7.1 only app). also there is no server to get hacked. even if your phone gets stolen you funds are reasonably secure if it's pin locked due to the fact that the filesystem is encrypted using a hardware AES chip. It's about as secure as you can get short of a dedicated custom hardware device or paper wallet. I wanted a wallet with a beautiful, convenient user experience that is also as secure as possible for people who have zero understanding of computer security.

Hosted wallets don't insure your holdings if you access them from an infected device. Introducing a 3rd party holding your coins only increases your risk.
That 3rd party still needs to authenticate you securely, and whatever method they use to do that can also be used to authenticate the user directly to the bitcoin network. i.e. a private key stored on a malware hardened device like an iPhone, that then authenticates the user with a fingerprint or easy to remember pin. This is the primary motivation for my own work in highly secure, easy-to-use, dead simple [wallet]( software.
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:44:51
Banks used to issue their own currencies, during the [free banking era](

It would require a remote jailbreak exploit, and if the wallet keeps the keys in the iPhone secure enclave, apple claims its secure even if the kernel gets compromised. (My own testing suggests it gets wiped if the phone is jailbroken)

You don't have to read the source code yourself anymore than you need to read the source code for openssl.

I built [breadwallet]( to be safe and convenient for regular people like your friends. It's a real bitcoin client, so there's not even a server at all that could go down. It's safe even if their phone gets stolen, and it explains that the backup phrase is for if the phone gets lost or broken, so they understand why they have to write it down.
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:19:27
My goal is to reduce bitcoin loss as much as possible. Putting a password on the backup phrase alone will increase losses.
2-of-3 does not involve asking the user to secure 3 keys in 3 locations, think of it as exactly like the system you're asking for, except there's a second key you can write down in case you forget your password. (it's like writing down your password and keeping it in a second location, except that you can still restore the wallet if you loose the first key using your password and the second key)
2-of-3 is the solution, *really*!

When sweeping, you are requesting funds not in your wallet yet. Funds in your wallet are always available whenever you can access the bitcoin network without any other service.
Being open source and not relying on external services that can get hacked for accessing wallet funds make it more secure than other iOS options. breadwallet also uses best practices related to key storage with the secure enclave, payment protocol, and memory security, which other wallets may or may not.
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:03:44
while not technically incorrect, the term "server" is generally used to refer to a trusted machine that you rely on for data. If the server(s) get hacked or go down, you loose access to your data or can be fed malicious data. If you don't trust the data and can connect to any number of independently operated, untrusted machines, the term used is "peer" or "node".

We won't do it until we can do it safely.

Both of these were created by people, are decentralized and autonomous and are incredibly valuable, but their value comes from the fact that they are standards. You can't just create new ones and expect it to work. That would be fundamentally misunderstanding where their value comes from. That's [cargo cultism](

With fake input amounts you can cause arbitrary funds to be sent as a tx fee, but this doesn't benefit the attacker directly, so less likely to be a problem. Fake payment addresses is a problem though. It's also a problem in breadwallet when not using payment protocol, but there is an advantage to doing x509 validation of the payee identity on the hardened device for merchants supporting payment protocol.
Has anyone successfully performed the app crash key extraction on an iOS app without jailbreaking? (It looks like jailbreaking wipes the secure enclave, though only newer devices have secure enclave) I'd love to learn more about this attack.

I'm the author of the "other client", [breadwallet]( (breadwallet is the only bitcoin network client in the app store, all the other iOS wallets use a trusted server for balance and transaction data) I developed the BIP39 standard along with the guys behind trezor.
All those 12 words do is encode a 128bit "seed". From the seed you can generate any number of "private keys". Each "private key" has corresponding bitcoin address that can be made public without revealing the key. Your wallet is just a collection of keys, and those keys are all generated from the same seed.

If you think the price is being manipulated, then why not profit off the manipulators? You have a personal profit incentive to help correct the market. Buy the coins they're selling cheap now to push down the price (which helps counteract their attempts) and wait for the pump that these same manipulators will have to later pull off to make a profit.

Bitcoin was designed to have all the monetary properties. This is why people are starting to use it as money, and it has gained monetary value. It is a monetary commodity.

Tell that to Argentina, Zimbabwe, the Weimar republic, the Soviet Union... Even in Iraq the old Iraqi dinar is valued much higher because its not printed anymore. State management of a money supply is a liability, not an asset. People don't buy sophistry about macroeconomic stability, they only care about their own purchasing power, and the way to maximize it is to choose a store of value that is *scarce*. History is on my side my friend, and the masses understand this principle intuitively.

I've had a few email conversations with the SigSafe guy.

Do you ever access it from your desktop machine? What if that machine gets infected with bitcoin stealing malware or has a keylogger? What if dashlane gets hacked and you get a malicious app update that does have access? Using a password manager reduces your security to the level of a web wallet if it gets backed up to a web server. If it's not backed up off device, that's even worse since devices can get lost or broken. Bitcoin isn't a web service login.

A trezor is a simpler device than an iPhone with a smaller attack surface. However, a trezor has to trust payment request and blockchain data it gets from a host system, while breadwallet performs SPV and payment protocol validation right on the malware hardened device, so each has its advantages.

As far as I recall, Rand never wrote at length about monetary policy. Do you have a link?
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:52:56
It connects to random bitcoin nodes and uses a "bloom filter". This filter reduces the set of tansactions that get sent to you wallet (for better performance on mobile), so if the node is operated by an attacker, they know your transactions belong to that reduced set, but they don't know which ones are yours within that set.
If you want perfect financial privacy right now, a better option is to use a web wallet like blockchain.info through a tor browser. But make sure you know how to secure your system against malware!
I hope to add tor support to breadwallet, but it's not there yet.
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:14:12
I think you're confusing cause and effect here. Bitcoin isn't valuable because people spend resources mining it, people spend resources mining it because it is valuable. Even invested miners will shut off their equipment when it costs more in electricity than the market value of the bitcoin generated. In that event they can acquire even more bitcoin by buying on the market instead. If you assume a lot of miners have the goal of maximizing their bitcoin holdings, then when they stop adding mining capacity, that means they have more resources available for direct purchasing than they otherwise would have.

Silver was largely demonetized when trade became global in the Victorian era and world standardized on gold. Silver is about 5% of gold in market cap. It has some residual monetary value above its industrial use value because there's a stable pool of savers who believe gold is "overvalued", and they all have an incentive to standardize on a single alternative.
Bitcoin is clearly the winner as the standard medium of savings in crypto currency, so gold is a better comparison. There will likely always be people who think bitcoin is overvalued and standardize on one altcoin, whose value may then be comparable to silver.

Nothing is 100%, but it would at a minimum involve apple pushing an update to the operating system specifically designed to break the phone's security model. You would likely have time to transfer your funds out. Installing a keylogger would involve jailbreaking the phone, which with currently known exploits means wiping the phone.

I know anything new is inconvenient at first, but after he does that another time or two, he'll start to remember that $20 is about 35,000 bits. Before long when he sees a price in the store he'll be thinking about how many bits that is.

I chose iOS for that specific reason. hardware wallets are less secure if they're not hardware encrypted and pin locked (they can be physically stolen). multi-sig can be a big improvement, but only if it's not the kind where some service automatically counter-signs according to some spending limit (you can be robbed within those spending limits), or if the multiple devices you sign with are all vulnerable to malware.
here's a quote from a research paper on android security features:
"Compared to the Apple iOS platform, whose encryption features have for instance been investigated and discussed in [5], [6], or [7], Android’s encryption system has not been subject to detailed assessments by the scientific community so far. This seems reasonable at a first glance, as Android’s encryption system is rather simple and provides less features compared to the encryption system that is for instance integrated into Apple’s iOS platform."

Not to be overly self promotional, but my goal with [breadwallet]( was to make bitcoin safe and easy for exactly these people. On ios they're well protected from malware (a remote jailbreak exploit would be needed to steal keys) and every device is hardware aes encrypted by default, providing strong protection if your phone is stolen.
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:57:44
"bit" means a small amount, a part at the end of a drill, the thing that goes in a horses mouth, yet you don't get confused when "bit" is used to refer to specific unit of data, even though all those other meanings have been in use longer and one is even more common in normal use today. Humans have no trouble at all deriving meaning from context.
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:51:20
I built [breadwallet]( specifically to address the problem of making Bitcoin safe and simple for non technical people who don't understand the first thing about computer security.
iOSs locked down, sandboxed, signed-code-only security model provides good protection from malware, and all devices are hardware encrypted by default giving strong protection even if the phone is stolen. It's also a real bitcoin network client that runs SPV verification of blockchain data and does certificate and signature validation of payment addresses right on the hardened device instead of trusting a potentially compromised host system like current hardware wallets.

2fa lets you authenticate yourself to a remote service, but if you have malware on the device you use after authenticating, you're screwed. Dashlane uses 2fa for authorizing a new device to get your encrypted password store, but once the store is on a device, that device gets infected, then you decrypt the store on the infected device in order to use it, you're screwed. They downplayed this issue by saying it was unlikely.
The way hosted wallets do 2fa, is only to authenticate you to their online service. If you authenticate yourself by typing in your 2fa code on a device that's infected with malware, you're still screwed. Those services don't offer insurance if you access their service from a compromised device. And if the service were to go down, or they get a request to freeze your account or whatever, you loose access to your money.
You 12 word backup phrase is just an encryption key. The way to tie 2fa to an encryption key is to have 3 keys and require 2 out of three, so that if any one key is compromised, the attacker can't get access to the funds, and if one key gets lost you can still access funds.

breadwallet does use external exchange rate data. I'm planning on using multiple services so trust is at least distributed, but that's not done yet. If people know what their wallet balance should be then faked data won't result in loss, but it's possible they won't notice, so it's something I will be working on.
No other iOS wallet is SPV because SPV is hard. I spent the better part of a year working on it. The only other mobile SPV implementation is bitcoinj which all the SPV android wallets use. Mike Hearn also spent more than a year on it before it was ready.
With respect to the app store builds, you are correct. After this next maintenance release I will be working on figuring out deterministic builds for iOS. I don't know if it's possible, but I will try to get it to work. With deterministic builds anyone can build it themselves from source and verify the binaries are identical. In the mean time I will be posting the hash of the binary I uploaded to the app store, so we can at least verify that no apple employee modified it.

Even if you use a desktop wallet instead of a web wallet, you still have to harden your desktop system against malware. Even if the wallet is encrypted, the malware can wait for you to type in your password. The problem of bitcoin stealing malware is only going to get worse. Bitcoin is digital cash! Hardening a system against malware is not an easy task, even for technical people.
The simple way to safely hold private keys is either offline (like on paper) or using a secure, hardened chip like a hardware wallet or the iPhone secure enclave.

bitwallet isn't open source, so it requires the same level of trust as a hosted wallet. Also it relies on trusted servers for blockchain data.

services like coinbase and bitpay monitor a large number of nodes on the network, and will see a double spend attempt, and not mark payment as received until the correct one gets a few confirmations.
Another possible solution would be for miners to publish the blocks they are working on along with partial block solutions, so merchants can see how much hashing power is being spent confirming their tx before the next block is found. In practice though, just monitoring the network for double spend attempts is more than adequate.

No, bitcoin doesn't and never will pay dividends out of operating profits. If you buy bitcoin, you're betting that people will increasingly use it as a store of value. The more demand there is to hold bitcoin, the higher the price. It's value as a payment system is only a secondary indicator. The more popular the payment system, the more likely it will be that others will want to use it as a store of value and push up the price.

Anything is possible, but a backdoor left by apple would be a serious liability for them. That specific "backdoor" is consistent with the security scheme laid out in their white paper. It wouldn't enable them to remotely decrypt a specific app's keychain data. The biggest concern would be touch/key logging when you do a restore, where the data could then sent back to apple without your knowledge or consent, but again that would be a huge liability for them so they wouldn't have that installed on devices by default. It would require an OS update designed to break the phone's security.

Just use a paper wallet. When you're ready to spend them sweep the whole balance into a wallet app or hardware wallet. In 2-4 years you likely won't want to "cash out". Bitcoin is already cash, and can be spent instantly anywhere on the planet that has Internet, no capital controls, no borders, no debasement.

You want to hold whatever has the greatest certainty of having the *most* value when you're done holding it, not just what will maintain it's value. If you succeed you benefit the person who values it more when you make that future trade.


Not at all. Every action you take, you take because you think it will improve your situation more than the alternatives. Even getting out of bed in the morning. It is human nature to try to prosper, to create more value than there was before, to improve your situation. Growing total value means economic growth. It's how all the fantastic wealth you see around you was created, and why you're not a subsistence farmer.


stability, safety and happiness are a worthy and popular goals. so is prosperity, greater opportunities and more resources for your family, and generally improving your situation.

I also plan to add support for connecting through tor. Also when you publish a new transaction, it doesn't publish it to the peer you downloaded the chain from, since that peer potentially has more information about you if you had to reset the filter because it degraded too much when you were syncing.

This is both a positive in the event you accidentally delete the app, and a negative in that some people might sell/give away their phone without wiping it. You should always do a factory reset of any device with personal information on it before transferring to someone else. If you just want to wipe your breadwallet and not the whole device, you can start/restore another wallet in settings which will wipe the existing one first. If you don't do this, your funds are still protected by the pin code. The wallet limits the number of failed pin attempts to prevent an attacker trying many of them.
to answer your second question, a new receive address is generated automatically each time you receive funds. I wanted the wallet to manage your addresses so that non-technical users never need to worry about it. It just does the right thing. Eventually we want to get to the point that regular users never see bitcoin addresses just as they typically never see IP addresses.

Apple Pay is an attempt to improve that experience for the legacy financial system, but of course that's not available in Panama! I'll be adding Touch ID and otherwise refining and streamlining the bitcoin payment experience with breadwallet to compete with the Apple Pay experience as well.
And shouldn't you be honeymooning or something instead of browsing r/bitcoin ? :)
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:25:37
There is a pin code on the app which I recommend be different than the pincode for the phone, or you can use touchid for the phone so your pin isn't easily shoulder surfed.
The phone is hardware encrypted by default so you have strong protection even if the attacker has physical device access.
breadwallet is open source, source code is on github, but I assume you're asking about the PRNG. That is using apple's common crypto library, which in turn is using a hardware random number generator. You do have to trust apple on that one.
I will try to get deterministic builds working so anyone can verify it's built from the same source, and I do verify the version I upload is the same being hosted on the app store. If we can't get deterministic builds for iOS, then the next best thing is to build from source and examine the differences with the app store build to make sure they're normal build differences and not caused by source changes.
I agree that offline is even more secure assuming you're knowledgable enough to not screw it up. My goal was to make the most secure wallet I could for the millions of people who are never going to go to the trouble of educating themselves and then doing it offline.

breadwallet isn't a service. It's a standalone app for your digital cash that connects directly to the bitcoin network. It provides a much higher standard of security than web wallets or even desktop wallets, since it runs on a malware hardened device that's also hardware encrypted, and has no servers that can get hacked.
It even compares well with the security of dedicated hardware wallets since it can run cryptographic verification of payment requests (for merchants supporting payment protocol) right on the malware hardened device, which the current generation of hardware wallets can't do yet, and it holds your keys in the iPhone secure enclave.

Encryption won't help you if the system it's on gets infected with bitcoin stealing malware. It can just wait for you to decrypt it, or crack your password offline. You need to keep your keys offline entirely (easiest way is paper) or on a malware hardened device like a hardware wallet or iPhone secure enclave.
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:45:58
Correct. The device it gets the address from, and that you compare against, is typically a desktop system that even techies struggle to harden against malware. If the merchant supports payment protocol, then you can verify the payment request using x.509 certificate and signature, but that won't do you any good if the device doing to the verification is compromised. With an iOS wallet like breadwallet, the host device the request verification runs on is hardened against malware.

I'd just like to point out that [breadwallet]( is an actual bitcoin network client for iOS, which is least susceptible to malware of the popular computing platforms. (other iOS wallets use a trusted server for balance and transaction data) It's open source, and you can back up all your current and future bitcoins by writing down a single backup phrase.
I designed it to be the safest and easiest to use bitcoin wallet for regular people who are not security experts, and wouldn't know how to keep a desktop system secure enough to safely use a desktop or web wallet. (pretty much everyone, including most techies)

If you want bitcoin, you also need to ensure the system you hold your keys on is hardened against malware. I built [breadwallet]( for iOS because that platform is locked down and hardened against malware by default, and iOS devices are also hardware encrypted by default, protecting your funds even if the device is stolen. If you use a web or desktop wallet, make sure you know how to harden your system against malware yourself.

The wallet handles new address creation to make sure they are not reused.

coinpocket is a very nice app, however the security level of any web based wallet is not on par with breadwallet, due to the possibility of the server being hacked or browser exploits.

Currency and language facilitate trade and communication respectively. In both cases, everyone choosing the same standard medium vastly increases the value for everyone. It wouldn't make all that much difference if everyone spoke French or Spanish or English or German, so long as everyone who wants to communicate picks the same one, which is why English is the primary language on the internet. The same is true with currency. The more people who choose the same standard for storing value, the more valuable that store is for everyone.

I co-authored BIP39. breadwallet uses a 12 word BIP39 mnemonic which has 128bits of entropy. BIP43-44 came out after breadwallet was already in the app store, however there has been discussion about reserving BIP43 'purpose 0' for the default single wallet use case that both breadwallet and hive are using.
I went with 128bits because the strength of the 256bit ECDSA that bitcoin transactions use is about n/2, or 128bits.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:21:29
I'm looking into the possibility of deterministic builds for breadwallet, so anyone with some basic knowledge can compile it from source themselves and verify the hash against the app store build. This is what the satoshi client uses. App signatures make that a bit tricky though, since obviously I'm the only one who can sign an app with my developer key. You'd have to strip the signature before verifying the hash against your own build.
The problem with web wallets is that you have to trust that there's no browser exploit, and that the web server wasn't hacked.
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:30:19
I built [breadwallet]( specifically with these threats in mind.
iOS hardware encryption provides strong protection in the event of physical theft of the phone, and you back up your wallet on paper with a 12 word phrase in case your phone gets lost or broken. iOS app sandboxing, keychain and code signing provide good protection from malware/browser security holes/etc.. iOS seems to be the least susceptible to malware among the popular computing platforms.
It also connects directly to the bitcoin network, so there's no server that could get hacked or go down and cause you to loose access to your money.
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:58:47
If you forget both your backup phrase *and* your pin, I suppose you'd have to restore your phone. I will add a future option to reset the whole thing if you're locked out and you have zero balance, at least. If there's a balance though, it's probably better to force the user to reset the phone to destroy those bitcoins forever.

merchants who don't have 30%+ margins can't use credit cards at all for a $1 purchase.

In order for bitcoin to be successful, it needs to become the standard medium-of-savings. This is where all monetary value comes from. People want to hold it because they anticipate (speculate) that everyone else will want to hold it when they're ready to spend it. This is the whole *it* point of money, why it's a thing at all. Why does anyone want green paper with numbers on it? You can't do anything with except trade it to someone else, but why would that person want it if they can't do anything with it either except trade it away again, ad infinitum? The whole thing is a big speculative bubble that becomes stable, so long as everyone thinks everyone else will continue to want it, despite the fact that it has no direct use in itself.

I would love to. Getting bitcoin into the hands of millions of unbanked people using cheap android hardware is going to be incredibly important, however figuring how to do so without subjecting users to the risk of malware or physical theft is a real problem.
Android devices don't have filesystem encryption by default. You have to enable a long unlock code to get it, which no one does, and even then it's relatively easy to crack unless the device has hardware backed encryption (even some of the new devices don't have it). Also since android allows side-loading of apps and running unsigned code, there a lot more attack vectors for tricking users into installing malware. And most devices don't receive timely security patches and updates due to carrier customization and apathy. It's a real mess.
It may be possible to get down to acceptable risk levels with a combination of an NFC hardware dongle for holding keys and signing, and a native app for SPV verification of transaction data. Until then bitcoin on android is really just a toy for pocket change unless you're an android security expert. I'll continue to look at possible options.
@_date: 2014-10-12 22:47:03
Correct, you can't be tricked into changing the output amounts, but you are trusting the server for the size of the inputs consumed by a transaction. The much larger concern is that the keys are on the server and only encrypted with a user chosen password, and users are notoriously bad and choosing passwords. The capabilities of modern offline password cracking rigs are shocking. They take into account all the tricks humans use to make passwords memorable.

I'm always very interested in user feedback, but I have to consider the needs of all users, and also the impact on the bitcoin community as a whole (on the off chance the app becomes popular enough to have any such impact)
For example with iOS, many, many people complained about not being able to side-load apps, but as a result of that choice, iOS can be a secure enough platform to safely use with non-trivial amounts of bitcoin, unlike any other popular computing platform which are all horribly exposed to malware. Also apple refused to support flash on mobile, and though it was painful and limiting at first, now we all enjoy a much superior html5 experience nearly everywhere.

If your phone is pinlocked, then it is hardware AES encrypted to your pin+uuid. It would likely take a sophisticated attacker with special equipment (like an electron microscope), physical access, and unlimited time to crack it. In the mean time you can restore from your backup phrase on another device and transfer your balance out.


bitWallet is a nice app, but it's not a bitcoin network client. it relies on an external service to get transaction data. If that service gets hacked, you could be tricked into sending more money than you intended even if your private keys are still secure. Also if the service goes down, you can't access your money.

The former is useful indirectly more as marketing for the bitcoin brand.

In order to restore in another wallet, that wallet would need to use BIP39 as well as the same BIP32 tree structure. I've heard that hive is using the same BIP32 tree as breadwallet.
Curious what platform you use that you feel is more secure than iOS? I built [breadwallet]( for iOS because it's the most secure against both malware and physical theft of the popular computing platforms. All devices are AES hardware encrypted by default providing strong protection in the event of physical theft, and the locked down, sandboxed, signed-code-only security model significantly reduces the threat of malware. The secure enclave where the wallet seed is stored is even hardened against EM side-channel attacks. Also since it's running SPV verification of blockchain data, and x.509 certificate/signature validation of BIP70 payment requests on a malware hardened device, I think you could even make a case that it compares favorably with the security of dedicated hardware wallets that must trust a potentially compromised host system for blockchain data and payment addresses.

You still have strong protection in the event of the phone being stolen. Private keys are hardware encrypted, and the attacker needs to be able to unlock the phone to get at them.

No, I don't think so. People were using gold leaf even hundreds of years ago. 1 grain might be the smallest division in common use by gold dealers today, but if smaller units were useful for every day small change transactions, there's nothing about the physical properties of gold that would make that impractical. You can weave gold leaf into a paper note, or embed a tiny amount in some other base metal coin. It really is just that there is a sizable, stable pool of savers who refuse to buy gold because they perceive it to be "overvalued", so they standardize on one alternative.

It's more of a philosophical argument for freedom. All else being equal, people will prefer to hold a monetary commodity that is both durable and scarce (i.e. that doesn't get created or destroyed, so necessarily has a fixed quantity)
You can argue about macro economic counterfactuals until you're blue in the face, but people will still intuitively grasp that they would rather you not be able to inflate away the value of their savings. Satoshi gave the world that choice.

I'd really love to do an android version, but figuring out how to do so without risking the possibility of theft from malware is a real problem. Most android devices don't even get consistent security updates.

Desktop wallets are not recommended for non security experts. Bitcoin is digital cash. You want to hold it on a hardened, locked down platform like iPhone secure enclave or dedicated hardware wallet.
We designed breadwallet to be secure for people with little or no understanding of security.

Your keys are hardware encrypted in the secure enclave, so even if your phone is physically stolen you have strong protection.

Credit card transactions are very much *not* guaranteed by CC companies. An unconfirmed bitcoin transaction with a reasonable fee is far more likely to settle in your favor than a CC transaction.

Very cool Paul. Are you thinking of including some kind of "trust anchor" to avoid a situation where an attacker within bluetooth range can spoof the requesting device? Or does the sending device simply alert the user if a conflict is observed?
For [breadwallet]( there's an upcoming feature to use multipeer connectivity to find nearby devices (ad-hoc wifi and bluetooth). Receiving devices will display a large 4 digit pin to visually identify the correct device, and will alert both the sender and receiver if a nearby attacker tries to spoof the pin.

I was being a a little fesicious by saying block sizes were at fault. The parent undoubtedly was referring to the max block size limit as opposed to actual block sizes. Larger blocks mean more transactions per block which means smaller tx backlog which means faster confirmation.

Yet gold maintains a significant value in excess of it's industrial and decorative use value. This anomalous persistent value can be accounted for by people who hold it, not to use it themselves, but to store value to be traded away in the future. When choosing a commodity for this purpose, you have an incentive to try to pick whatever everyone else is going to pick, wether that's tulip bulbs, south sea company stock, gold, or bitcoin. These other currencies you mention, they weren't just willed into existence, they got their initial value as certificates redeemable for monetary commodities like gold or silver.

I appreciate your suggestions. As for 1) I think it's important for the community to move together to the bits standard. It's early days at the moment so I understand it's a pain right now to use bits when most others don't yet, but I think it will pay off in the end by helping the switch happen. If we don't all switch, it's going to hold back adoption. Two decimal places is the right choice for currency.
2) You actually can do this. On the amount screen, just tap the local currency amount and it'll swap them around with a nice bouncy animation.

That's a good point, though if the authentication were to use something like tpm, then you'd need malware to discover it from sensors, and then physical theft after that. At that point I think home invasion to steal the backup phrase is the bigger issue. For decryption, relying on strong passwords is not really workable. A pin code in combination with hardware encryption where the hardware can physically limit pin attempts is the solution I think is best for bitcoin.

That's a high bar, bitcoin hasn't passed it yet. The green paper in your wallet I suppose qualifies now that the gold standard is gone, but the balance in your checking account is solidly in the "money substitute" category. Bitcoin isn't yet a generally accepted medium of exchange, it's not yet a unit of account for anyone but bitcoin miners, it's not yet the standard medium of savings, and certainly not yet the most liquid commodity on the market, so it's not money.

Nothing is 100% secure, but for bitcoin to be useable, ultimately it will require some level of trust in the manufacturer of the secure hardware. This can be eventually be mitigated with insurance or similar methods. Keeping it on paper is safer but at a very significant cost to usability, and you have to use some computing device to create the paper wallet address anyway. We think secure hardware is the sweet spot between excellent security and everyday convenience, were you don't need to compromise much of either. This can be further improved in future with multisig services doing sophisticated fraud detection paired with insurance.

If you hold a currency instead of spending it, it means you're consuming fewer scarce economic resources that you otherwise would have.

Breadwallet uses a bloomfilter which obscures which transactions are yours, and because it's deterministic, new addresses are used for each tx so any single tx doesnt reveal your entire wallet history, but you are correct that it's not perfect with respect to privacy.

MITM is when you try to connect to a server, and an attacker tricks you into connecting to them instead, and then relays your traffic to your intended destination, so you don't notice. Breadwallet has no servers.
You are correct that no platform is 100% secure from malware. iOS is just the most secure of the popular options. The wallet also warns you on every launch to immediately wipe your wallet if it detects that the device has been compromised by jailbreaking. Don't use bitcoin on jailbroken phones. There are no known exploits for remote jailbreaking at the moment, and they will be patched quickly if discovered.
The worst a Sybil attack can do is prevent your wallet from seeing transactions. As soon as you connect to a non-sybil node, you'll see them. (You may need to do a rescan) A sybil node can't create fake transactions as breadwallet uses SPV to cryptographically verify that a transaction was included in the blockchain.

A lot of people have lost significant funds through misunderstanding how paper wallets and change addresses work, and an encrypted flashdrive won't help if you plug it into an infected host system that waits for you to decrypt it.

Again, not perfect, but safer than those options for the typical user, not to mention more usable and convenient.

My primary motivation for building [breadwallet]( was to create a simple, intuitive and beautiful user experience, and build it to much higher standard of security than any other bitcoin wallet out there.
iOS is the least susceptible to malware of any of the popular computing platforms, and when the device is pinlocked it is hardware AES encrypted making it reasonably secure even in the event of physical theft. Even a dedicated hardware wallet without a pin will let you down if it's stolen. It's also the only iOS wallet that's an actual bitcoin network client, meaning it doesn't rely on a trusted server to be able to spend your money. But all of this is hidden from the user. They just know it's easy to use, never goes down, and doesn't get robbed.

He's right, but it's only an issue if the same k is used twice. There was an android prng bug that resulted in stolen funds a while back from this.

As the author of breadwallet, I'd like to point out there is code in place to start increasing fees based on average blocksize over a 24hr period. A short spike over a few hours will not trigger increased fees and just result in confirmation delays. Also it's not a normal market where higher fees result in more production of blockspace. There is an artificial production quota so you'll just be crowding other people out.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:54:31
fees are based on the tx size, not hard coded. the fee rate is updated with with each app release, and we use an api endpoint to bump them up if network conditions change quickly between releases, and for people who haven't updated. the app also has a hard coded range for fee rate updates, in case the api were to be compromised.

I actually think Litecoin might be the only altcoin that ultimately turns out not to be a scam, and ends up with a stable pool of savers. There will always be a group of people who think bitcoin is "overvalued", but even those people all have an incentive to standardize on a single alternative. Whatever alternative that turns out to be will be the one non-scam altcoin. This same phenomena is why silver for instance has a persistent monetary value around 5% that of gold. I still wouldn't own any silver or litecoin though.

The performance improvements are incremental. It will stop to rebuild the bloom filter with new addresses less often since it can generate more addresses quickly at the start. The speed of other nodes on the network, and how long ago you created your wallet will have a much more noticeable effect at the moment. It will probably be about the same speed despite the fact that your wallet is older now than the last time you tried it.

The best currency would be one that has perfect monetary properties, perfectly durable (never destroyed), perfectly scarce (never more created), infinitely divisible, instantly transportable, perfectly fungible, and also happens to be what every one else standardizes on as a store-of-value. All else being equal, that's what people will prefer. That makes it better according the expressed value judgements of those involved.

Paper wallets and offline systems are excellent for people who are technically inclined and already familiar with bitcoin.
[breadwallet]( was designed to be very secure for people who have little understanding of computer security or things like how bitcoin change addresses work. It keeps your private keys in the iPhone secure enclave, so you have strong protection even if your phone is physically stolen, and iOS is the best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms. It also connects directly to the bitcoin network so there are no servers that might get hacked or go down.
@_date: 2015-05-24 10:14:12
Moving bitcoin around doesn't increase it's value. Speculation is absolutely where all forms of money get their value, by definition. If it's valuable for something other than trading to someone else at a future date, that portion of the value is non-monetary.
Shuffling it around a lot may indirectly increase the value though, by creating the perception that it's being adopted more as a store-of-value by other savers/hoarders/holders/speculators, resulting in more people actually adopting it.

Your funds are actually held securely right on the bitcoin network, and you can access them from any connected device using your recovery phrase.
Your phone is hardware encrypted, so even if it's stolen, you still have strong protection against the thief getting access to your recovery phrase. They would need to be able to unlock your phone, which even [DOJ]( complains they are not able to do.

We're working on an android version that makes use of a trusted execution environment to achieve equal or better security levels as on iOS. We will never release a product we believe exposes users to risk of malware theft.
Mycelium appears to be a nice wallet especially if you want to use their local trading feature. I believe their wallet is "server trusting", in that it relies on mycelium servers rather than connecting directly to the bitcoin network. Also I haven't examined their keychain use to see if they follow best practices, storing using "this device only" to prevent the possibility of itunes or icloud phone backups getting hacked, etc.

I built breadwallet so people could safely and conveniently use bitcoin even if they don't know about computer security. Just write down the backup phrase on paper and keep it safe like the app instructs and you'll have a high level of security. 
If you mean trading using a bitcoin exchange that holds your bitcoin for you, that's not something I can help with other than to say don't keep more than you intend to sell on the exchange.

By that I mean that you are free to use other products. Governments actually restrict what you can do by force, while companies like apple and google can only give you additional options that you wouldn't have without them.
The market is already decentralized in the respect that anyone can offer new devices and systems that you are free to trust or not. What you don't want is a wallet device that has no restrictions applied by someone you trust, and you certainly shouldn't trust yourself unless you're a security professional.

It's a very cool device. It'll be even better once hardware wallets can run SPV verification of blockchain data, and X.509 cert/sig validation of payment requests on the device instead of trusting a potentially compromised host system. Right now the best option for that is a locked down, malware resistant smartphone, but that's still slightly more vulnerable to an exploit that could allow access to the phone's keychain.
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:20:34
There are secure options available for people who have no understanding of security. This is the primary motivation for breadwallet. iPhone is best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms, and all devices are hardware encrypted by default, so you have strong protection even if the phone is physically stolen. We're also working on an Android version with similar levels of security using a trusted execution environment. Since it connects directly to the bitcoin network, there aren't even any servers to go offline and prevent access to funds.

Do you have an iPhone? I built [breadwallet]( to be very safe and convenient for regular people who don't understand anything about security. Hardware AES encryption provides strong protection against physical theft, and the iOS security model with code signing and app sandboxing significantly reduces the risk of malware theft.

Apple and Google are not the government.
They have a team of some of the best security experts in the world trying to make their products secure for people who don't understand security (which is nearly everyone).
I'm all in favor of more competitors entering the market, but to make a safe bitcoin wallet device, those new competitors will also lock down and restrict their devices. The last thing you want is to run arbitrary code on a wallet device. That's a recipe for disaster. Either you have to trust someone like the security professionals at apple or google, or you have to be a security expert and lock it down yourself.

not sure I quite get what you mean. you suggest people destroy coin days to vote or something?
A supermajority of hashing is unlikely to disagree with the economic majority unless the miners are acting on incentives that are opposed to the incentives of bitcoin users. Bitcoin users want the lowest fees possible and no restrictions on the number of transactions, and so will support larger blocks. They will also prefer the security of having the majority of hashing power on their chain. If the fork happens, those interests will be aligned.

@_date: 2014-09-26 21:10:22
actually no... the lower the pool of people who want to hold bitcoin is, the less it can be used to facilitate transfers since the spread increases. for instance, today you could conceivably send $1M worth of bitcoin but not $1B... if bitcoin were at $0.40 then you couldn't send $1M.

breadwallet uses child-pays-for-parent to get low or no fee receives unstuck (supported by a small percentage of hashing power, enough to get them unstuck eventually). It might be due to non-standard signature encoding that older nodes accept, but newer nodes don't.

We think android is incredibly important as well. We're exploring some options that we think will allow us to create an android version with the same or better level of security as iOS.

iPhones are hardware encrypted by default, so you have strong protection if the device is stolen.
But if you want, you can still do cold storage with breadwallet. Create a new wallet, write down your backup phrase and receive address, and then start/restore another wallet to wipe it.

I always thought the plan was for miners to advertise in their blocks that they are ready to support new larger blocks, and once something like 90%+ of the previous 1000 blocks say they are ready, the cutover happens, avoiding any significant problems with competing forks. If miners don't want it or don't agree, it won't happen.
The article suggests it'll just happen whenever a big block gets mined willy nilly.

It just way overshot in November for a few weeks and corrected, the China, Russia, India all banned it to some degree or other, then the largest exchange collapsed taking nearly $1B in savings with it...

If there is little demand hold bitcoin, then you have give up more of it to entice the other party to accept it. It's value tends toward zero. If there is a lot of demand to hold it, then you only need to offer a little to find a person willing to accept the trade. It's value increases. The demand to hold money determines the value of money, though I'll grant that the value being produced by the rest of the economy does have an effect on how much demand there is to hold money. If there's not enough food to go around today, you're less likely to be worried about saving for the future.

You can scan the private key and it'll tell you how much is there when it asks if you want to transfer it to your wallet.
If you scan the public address, it'll just ask how much you want to send to it as with any public address. Showing the amount on the address isn't something we'd want to clutter up the highly streamlined sending process with.

If they buy a stake in bitcoin, it's a one time shot. As bitcoin becomes more popular, their ability to set monetary policy and monetize debt is commensurately reduced. Eventually they'd have to start producing value instead of consuming it to maintain a controlling position, just like anyone else.
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:24:12
The way the bitcoin network works today is that if your transaction gets relayed by the p2p network, you have high confidence that it will eventually get mined. If you try to "buy blockspace below market value" as you say, the network will indicate this to you up front by refusing to relay the transaction. If it's not accepted by the p2p network, you know for sure it won't be mined since it not in the mempools of well connected nodes.
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:05:48
1) if it's possible, then others will also figure it out.
2) controlling the most hashing power doesn't let you make arbitrary changes to the protocol. the most you can do is block transactions. You could in theory rewrite transaction history to double spend, but even that would only affect new nodes coming online that hadn't witnessed the original transactions, so it would be noticed and stopped using out-of-band methods like hard-coded checkpoints.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:14:57
It doesn't matter how many miners agree, what matters is how much of the hashing power agrees. Once a supermajority of hashing power agrees on a fixed set of consensus rules including the exact block they take effect, that avoids a problematic split. This can easily be determined in advance and coordinated through the proof-of-work consensus mechanism like anything else in bitcoin. Further, if the economic majority of bitcoin users don't agree with the hashing power, they get a lower difficulty to mine on the original chain, and can quite happily ignore the miners that stop mining original bitcoin.

I was able to get ahold of a wallet with this problem. It was "tarpitted" where a bitcoin node had told it to connect only to other nodes that it controlled. Deleting and reinstall the app fixes this, but you should also be able to break out by forcing the "not connected" status bar to appear (by turning on airplane mode for instance) and tapping it. This will cause it to revert to DNS node discovery.
I'll be improving the app to detect the issue and revert to DNS automatically.

Appreciate the suggestion, but I think it's super important to keep the app minimal and focused. Ideally users shouldn't need to see bitcoin addresses any more than they need to see ip addresses. Payment requests will in future contain multiple addresses or steath addresses, and wallets are already composed of dozens or hundreds of addresses. Paper wallets are not really practical for mass adoption and can lead to costly mistakes through misunderstanding of change addresses, so I expect they also will decline in use over time.

In a soft fork, disagreeing miners can still mine but might have some of their blocks orphaned. With a hard fork, all their blocks will be orphaned. But like I said, that's not an issue if a supermajority of hashing power agrees to ignore a small minority. The trick is to make sure a supermajority of hashing power agrees on the new consensus rules and exactly when to start enforcing them, which can be accomplished by the method I originally described.

you are correct about old nodes. they create their own fork. in a soft fork they can still mine the longest chain but might have their blocks orphaned. in a hard fork they have their own chain. what I'm saying is that it doesn't matter if they have their own chain on the original rules if the economic majority of bitcoin users agree with the supermajority of hashing power and all ignore the old nodes with their shorter chain on the original rules. they do their thing and are ignored by everyone else.

Can you message me so I can try to figure out your issue? It may be a core data corruption issue.
@_date: 2015-05-11 02:04:14
factor one is possession of the phone (something you have), factor two is either knowledge of the pin (something you know), or fingerprint (something you are). This 2FA is enforced locally in hardware so you're not vulnerable to man-in-the-middle, phishing or browser security holes as with remote online wallet services.
The real security is in the device passcode which you can set to any length. The app pin code is more to protect you if you lend your phone to someone, or someone swipes the phone out of your hand while you're using it. That said, we plan to allow longer app passcodes in future.

Now realize that this just from the relatively mild network effect inherent in communication protocols, where you only benefit from other people using it who you want to directly communicate with.
The network effect with money is orders of magnitude stronger. Every single person who adopts bitcoin as a store-of-value causes a direct financial benefit for every single other person who does the same. Not just a small added convenience only from the few others they directly interact with. Everyone wants to hold what everyone else wants to hold. Money is the ultimate network network. At this point the only thing that could stop bitcoin would be a fatal unrepairable flaw.

We've had a handful of reports similar to this one. So far every one was corrected with a rescan or just trying the transaction a second time.
One thing several of these instances had in common was that the user attempted to use one of the "bitcoin doubler" services that intentionally produce transactions that will propagate (at least partially) but never confirm. We're improving the wallet to detect and ignore these type of transactions, which involves obtaining and recursively examining the full dependent chain of unconfirmed transactions for any funds received, to make sure that full nodes are not incorrectly relaying unconfirmable transactions of this type.
There have been no instances that we've been made aware of, of incorrect address handling or incorrect transaction creation.

You are correct that no solution can ever be 100% secure, but neither iOS or breadwallet makes use of OpenSSL, and even if a vulnerability in some other networking library were discovered, iOS is restricted to running only signed code, and apps are sandboxed. I recommend taking a look at the iOS security whitepaper:

Bitcoin security is a huge issue. Exchanges, web and hosted wallets are vulnerable to phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attack, and bitcoin stealing malware. None of them insure your funds if you access your account from an infected computer.
To be safe, you want to use a wallet that's either offline, or on malware hardened device, like a hardware wallet or the iPhone secure enclave.
The primary motivation for the [breadwallet]( project was to create an incredibly simple, easy-to-use bitcoin wallet that connects directly to the bitcoin network, and runs on a locked down, hardware encrypted, malware hardened platform. It's designed to be secure-by-default for anyone, even if they have little or no understanding of computer security.

Thanks bobalison, this is why we have always strongly recommended against storing bitcoin on jailbroken devices.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:56:26
This is the correct answer. I haven't tried it with Hive myself, but I understand they use the same wallet structure as breadwallet.
Also breadwallet source is available, so anyone could create a tool to retreive funds (as it appears dcpos.github.io has done), or you could even just build breadwallet yourself and run it in the Xcode simulator on your desktop.
Just remember, *never* type your backup phrase *anywhere* unless you are restoring your wallet. Every new device or tool you type it into increases your risk of theft. That includes password managers, which reduce your wallet security to the level of a web wallet since they are backed up online and encrypted with a typically weak, user chosen password.

I don't think there's any dispute that bitcoin holders want the lowest possible transaction fees and no restrictions on the number of transactions. That's the only reason miners would have to support the hard fork, as it doesn't benefit them directly in their mining. The miners in this instance are making a judgement call about what they believe the vast majority of bitcoin users want. If it isn't obvious to them, if there is a lot of uncertainty or disagreement, then they won't do it.

Some have a flexible-caps, and others have multiple increases at fixed intervals.
In order to not subsidize tx long term, I advocate increasing the number of tx paying the minimum relay fee or higher by growing bitcoin adoption. Remember, total-fees = average-fee-per-tx times number-of-tx. To maximize total-fees, you want to maximize number-of-tx.

I built [breadwallet]( to be simple and safe for non-technical people who don't know anything about computer security. It's the first bitcoin wallet for iPhone that connects directly to the bitcoin network instead of trusting a server that could get hacked or go down.
Remember with hosted wallets like coinbase or circle, you don't actually have bitcoin. What you have is a promise from the hosted wallet company for some bitcoin. If you choose to use a web or desktop wallet, make sure you know how to harden your system against malware. Bitcoin stealing malware is already a significant portion of all the malware being discovered, and bitcoin is still tiny.

No, we have several layers of defense.
- we're not using openssl, common crypto or CoreBitcoin (we use libsecp256k1)
- we only use the private key immediately after authenticating the user, never in the background or at rest (phone is in users hand at time of signing)
- we only sign with each private key once
- once a private key is used for signing and the tx broadcast, the funds associated with it are no longer on that key (and we keep the xpub private) so a single key being compromised won't result in loss of funds
- we're using the constant-time constant-memory variants of the libsecp256k1 signing functions which the paper says are not known to be vulnerable to this line of attack
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:28:44
This is generally correct. The keys are stored on the iOS keychain in the secure enclave. It would require a remote jailbreak exploit for a malicious app to access another app's keychain, however apple claims the secure enclave is protected even if the kernel is compromised. My own testing suggests that the secure enclave is wiped if the phone is jailbroken, at least with currently known jailbreak exploits. If you write down your backup phrase you should be safe.
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:44:01
that would be a nice feature, but you'd have to have some service monitoring your receive addresses and sending the notifications through apple's servers, so you'd be exposing your private financial info to both apple and that service. I might offer it as an option with appropriate warnings, possibly under a section for privacy options.

Yes, this is why we chose to use iPhone as our first platform. It's the only mass market device with strong security by default, as well as being hardened against malware. We think it approaches the security level of dedicated hardware wallets, and in some limited ways even exceeds it, due to the fact that blockchain data and payment protocol certificates are cryptographically verified right on the hardened device instead of relying on a non-hardened host system.
1) Yes. I believe there may be a pin cracking tool that works on iPhone 4, but nothing known that works on 4s and up, last I heard, and I try to stay on top of such things.
2) longer pins are more secure since there's a much lower chance to guess, and if a pin cracking tool exploit is later discovered, it greatly increases the time and difficulty for an attacker.
3) A 4 digit pin is reasonably strong if it's chosen randomly, and the device is able to enforce a limited number of attempts. With 10 attempts before lockout, the chances of an attacker guessing it is 1 in  1000.

Hodling is the entire *it* point of money. Why does anyone want green paper with numbers on it? No one ever consumes money. The only thing you can do with it is hold it before trading it away to someone else who wants to hold it. 
The purpose of money is transferring purchasing power across time. Even if you only hold it from the time you get your weekly pay on Friday afternoon until you can make it to the bar after work, you are using money to transfer purchasing power over that short period.
Since there is lots of demand by others to hold bitcoin, you can trade it for just about anything under the sun any time you wish, from hotels and plane tickets, to computer equipment, to sushi.

Hold on there, I didn't say it was stable, or that even most people are holding for the long term (though I think probably most are). What I'm saying is that whatever value bitcoin has, it's due entirely to people using it as a store-of-value, whether that's a few pennies worth only for a few seconds, or $millions for the long term.


Gold is the counter example. $8trillion in value, and not used for trade anywhere that I'm aware of apart from large real estate purchases in Vietnam.


Adopting bitcoin as a store-of-value *is* using it as a replacement for the existing financial system.

While this is true, the network effects of money lead to standardization. This was the case in the victorian era when trade was first globalized and gold largely displacing silver in countries that had previously standardized on it. You can see the same trend today with the US dollar becoming more and more the world reserve currency. Everyone wants to hold what everyone else wants to hold.

At any given average-fee-per-tx, you want to maximize number-of-tx. What you absolutely want to avoid is a situation where the max-block-size is limiting number-of-tx. That will result in not maximizing total-fees.
I agree that miners should penalize low fee tx by delaying their confirmation. Also since full node operators must bear the cost of full validation, they have an incentive to set a minimum relay fee that results in a transaction volume that they can cope with. They can't control transaction volume individually, but by affecting the prevailing minimum relay fee, they can influence volume indirectly.

Very few people understand or think about money in the abstract, even very smart people, even people who are professional economists. It's a common refrain in r/bitcoin that holding bitcoin is somehow not using it, or not contributing to its success, when holding is the single most important thing anyone can do to help bitcoin become money. This directly relates to OPs question, and it's in no way treating someone like a "retard" to point it out.

Your point is well taken, but bitcoin has to be usable to succeed, and we think we have a solution with a high degree of security. A hardened device using hardware encryption, code signatures, app sandboxing and keychain service is going to still be resistant to vulnerabilities found in any particular network library or service. It's not a situation where one vulnerability cracks the system wide open typically. The security scheme is multi-layered and deep. Mobile platforms are being designed to much higher degree of security than popular desktop systems have been up to now.

The entire point of bip75 is to let you protect your privacy while still knowing who you are transacting with. "Who" doesn't have to be a real name, it can be any kind of pseudonymous identity you'd like.
Peter Todd apparently is arguing that Bitcoin users shouldn't know who they are transacting with in order to protect everyone's privacy. This is asinine.

The market cap of bitcoin is barely larger than a single mid-cap stock right now at $11billion. At $5000/coin it would still be only the size of a single large-cap stock. The world's gold reserves are around $8 trillion. That's $380,000 a coin if btc reaches parity. Major global currencies have market caps in the many 10s of $trillions.

This is what bitcoin is really about. Becoming the new monetary standard for planet earth. When metalworking was invented, cultures around the world switched from using seashells to using precious metals as money. It had better monetary properties. Then banking was developed and people gradually shifted to using bank deposits as money. Since a bank deposit is an entry in a ledger, it's information, so it can be transported at the speed of information, however it's not scarce, since more can easily be created. The blockchain is a new monetary technology on par with metalworking. It enables a new monetary commodity with nearly mathematically perfect monetary properties. It might take a while, but it's inevitable that it will eventually supplant inferior monetary standards.

So would a priority transaction be one that the recipient should be alerted to right away? I'm being facetious, but you see the problem. In any case there's no need to introduce this type of complexity. There are better solutions that are transparent to the user, and even make the current transaction experience simpler by allowing the recipient to take responsibility for fees so the sender doesn't have to be aware of them.

We're attempting to find the right balance between making it easy for people to access their funds with other tools if they need to, and not encouraging insecure practices.
We follow the bip32 default wallet layout, and bip44 also depends on bip32, so in order to build a tool compatible with breadwallet recovery phrases, you actually need to implement fewer standards than if we also followed bip44. The other major SPV wallet implementation also uses the default bip32 wallet layout. I believe it's the most common standard for single account wallets.

breadwallet doesn't allow you to recover all possible bip39 compatible phrases, however all breadwallet recovery phrases are bip39 compatible.

Managing your own phrase is something most users are not willing to do at all. They don't understand that it must be kept secret, and asking them to find and not loose a peice of paper is just too much to ask.

Our goal is to help mass adoption. We will do everything we can to keep bitcoin as simple as possible. Presenting users with a priority option requires them to understand a lot of obscure bitcoin concepts like what a confirmation even is.
Remember, there are large sections of the population who will tell you they don't have internet access, even though they use Facebook on their phones. Those kind of people use money too. We have to make bitcoin work for them. I don't have a priority slider on my credit card, what would that even mean?

As far as priority is concerned, we don't think this is something that's compatible with making Bitcoin into a major global currency. its only the recipient who cares about confirmation times, so the solution is going to be a payment protocol extnetion that lets merchants specify the total fees they're willing to cover and the minimum fee rate they will accept for 0-conf

I agree, but how in the world do you measure that? Is it overpriced or underpriced? With a stock you can look at earnings per share, with real estate you can look at rental rates, with commodities you can look at whether stockpiles are increasing or decreasing... but when you look at, for instance gold, existing stockpiles would supply industrial demand for the next 5000 years. By that metric it's price should be nearly zero. To someone who doesn't understand monetary demand, this makes no sense at all. It must be some kind of scam or bubble. If you define a bubble as lots of people all acquiring some asset with no intention of using it, in the hopes of flipping it to the next person, then money sets off all the warning buzzers.

People use money to transfer purchasing power across time. They hold something they have no intention of consuming, in order to trade it away later. This necessarily increases demand "artificially" for the commodity being held, purely for the purpose of "flipping" it to someone else later. Whoever is holding this commodity last then would be the "bagholder", except that the demand to hold purchasing power in reserve will never go away so long as humans trade. It can continue indefinitely. In fact the game theoretical optimum is for everyone to standardize on one commodity for this purpose. The demand to hold it increases it's market price in terms of other goods and services.
Holding purchasing power in reserve, i.e. saving or hoarding, doesn't hurt the economy. It's simply a value preference. The purpose of economic activity to provide what people value. Everyone at some point prefers to have the ability to consume in the future rather than right now, so this gives money it's value.

We've designed it to take advantage of the all the best security features available on the platform. The reason we waited until Android 6.0 to release an android version is because unlike older versions, it now has boot verification and hardware encryption on all supported devices.

@_date: 2016-11-04 22:04:13
unfortunately confirmation doesn't work like that, there's basically a big cliff where if you fall below it, you don't get confirmed at all
we are targeting the lowest fee possible while not risking a transaction failure
the fee amount is based on how many previous transactions that you've received, that you're now using to fund your payment, so if you receive 10 payments and then spend that total amount, your fee will be close to 10x more

Volatility will necessarily decrease as the bitcoin market grows. It's still quite tiny now, the size of a single madcap stock, compared to regional currencies with market caps in the tens of $trillions. That said, before we get there, the volatility will be in the right direction. Bitcoin has been the best performing currency in the world every year since it's inception with the exception of 2014 when mt.gox imploded.

A provisioning profile is not the same as rooting the phone. They can install or delete apps, but the wallet can't be accessed outside the breadwallet app on your device. This is not really any different than installing random app store apps from authors you don't know on you phone. iOS has app sandboxing to prevent one app from accessing another app's data or keychain.

Scarcity and durability are core monetary properties. A commodity that perfectly embodies these two properties will necessarily have a fixed supply. If bitcoin was designed to function worse as money, it may never have taken off in the first place, or it may have been outcompeted by a better designed money.

The issue was only in an older release. The qr actually updates as soon as syncing completes, which typically takes only seconds, which is why it got through our testing. Also to trigger it, you have to record the recovery phrase in a screenshot, so no funds were ever lost.

Very true indeed, but OP wants to know what determines the price of bitcoin. As you say, it people's preferences, so then, why do people have the preferences they do? No one can use bitcoin directly, only trade it, so why the heck does anyone want it at all? And will they still want it tomorrow?
In the case of monetary commodities, these preferences are rooted in game theory, what everyone thinks everyone else is going to do, since by definition you can't actually consume money, only flip it someone else (a clinical person might say to a bigger fool).
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:20:33
I agree the analogy degrades as issuance ebbs, but when it was first used, it was more important for people to understand where bitcoins come from, who issues them.
Making coins hard to issue really is the main point of proof of work. Just like the cost and difficulty of mining is what keeps gold scarce despite there being massive quantities of the stuff in earths crust and oceans. It was thinking about how to take hashcash, proof that you spent scarce resources, and turn it into something you could trade that likely lead to the bitcoin idea. Szabo for instance rightly recognized that every form of money from wampum to the giant stones of yap, all represented large amounts of "wasted" effort. But it's not really wasted just because you can't consume it, it becomes valuable over and over again every time a mutually profitable trade is facilitated. The effort is incredibly valuable as evidence the token is and will remain scarce.

I suppose it would be more accurate to say that production is what's known. The supply being offered at any given moment is a function of the demand and the price, but again that's not very useful for understanding why the price (and hence the demand) is what it is.

I don't know, the analogy is pretty good at describing the role they play in a digital currency system modeled to behave like a precious metal, since metals spontaneously gained value as money on the market without having to be controlled or issued by governments. It just doesn't describe their role as keepers of the public ledger, a role that is played by the laws of physics in the case of metals.
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:13:00
We know the supply, so to understand what determines the price we need to understand what determines the demand.

That's one way to do it, but with [BIP32]( it's a little more complex involving chain codes and elliptic curve point multiplication. This allows you to calculate a "master public key" from the seed as well. Someone with the master public key can generate all the public bitcoin addresses in the chain without knowledge of any of the private keys.

People will say supply and demand... and that answer is correct, but not very useful. Since we know the supply, that means to understand the price, we need to understand the demand. Why do people want bitcoin? All you can do with it is trade it to someone else, so what's going on here? It's not like bread that you can eat.
It turns out that bitcoin, or any form of money, is useful as a way to store value over time. People want to acquire something that they don't intend to use, but that others will want in the future so it can be traded to them for something else. You want whatever you speculate others will want in the future. All monetary value is speculative, that is, based on the speculation about what others are going to value in the future. The optimal solution to reduce speculative uncertainty is for everyone to standardize on one thing for transferring value across time. Of course when everyone does this, the demand for that thing (and the price assuming the supply is sufficiently restricted) goes through the roof. The price of bitcoin is determined by the how many people want store value in bitcoin now in the belief that the same or more people will want to do the same in the future. They are speculating, just like people storing their value in gold, tulip bulbs, USD, or las vegas real estate, in the hopes of being able to flip it to someone else later.
@_date: 2015-08-04 16:07:38
It's circular logic to say its valuable because it can store value. Where does the value it represents come from? With a house it's directly usable as shelter even if you can't ever sell it, with bread you can eat it, with company stock you receive potential future dividends. With money... ??? How do you utilize if you're stuck with it? It would be worthless in that situation. Yet everyone, from every culture going back to pre-history wants it. How do you explain that demand?
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:30:27
Why not use a real bitcoin client? You can have 2FA enforced directly on the device itself, where possession of the phone is the first factor (something you have) and knowledge of the passcode (something you know) or your fingerprint (something you are) is the second factor. You also write down a recovery phrase and store it somewhere safe so if you lose the phone you can recover your wallet on a new one. Since the lost phone is hardware encrypted your funds are still strongly protected. You never have to worry about a wallet provider's servers going down or getting hacked, forgetting a password, man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing attacks, desktop malware or web browser security holes. It's just an app on your phone and the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:44:43
No, that won't help when the incentive is high enough. Not even security professionals working at bitcoin exchanges can prevent a non-malware hardened system from getting compromised when there's a high enough digital cash incentive. You download and run apps and open documents all the time without doing a full security audit. That's what happened to bitstamp. Without malware hardening you can't download apps or docs.
@_date: 2015-08-01 17:05:30
we have a few ideas on this front, probably involving having the funds set aside from your wallet balance (but still in your wallet) until the recipient installs a compatible wallet that then tells your wallet what address to send the funds to.

Hardware encryption gives you strong protection even if the phone is on if implemented correctly. Sensitive data remians encrypted when the phone is locked and it enforces limited unlock attempts.
It's decentralized 2fa. Possession of the device is factor one (something you have) and the passcode or fingerprint is factor two (something you know or are). Breadwallet also has a Touch ID spending limit to protect against the fake finger attack being able to empty the wallet.

Really sorry it wasn't simple for you. I upvoted because criticism is the best way we can improve. What issue did you encounter? We really try hard to remove every barrier.

So the argument I've been advocating is that you want to control blocksize with fees, you don't want to control fees with blocksize.
If you accept the premise that we need to restrict blockchain growth to maintain decentralization, then the appropriate way to do this is with increased minimum relay fees, and better tx selection for miners to discourage low fees at the margins. Having a fixed production quota causes all kinds of problems... failed transactions, entirely unpredictable confirmation times, wildly fluctuating and unpredictable fees since blocksize can't adjust with short term demand spikes, etc, etc... If you just increase fees without a fixed production quota, people will voluntarily economize of blockchain use, but without all the other problems. blocksize can adjust short term to deal with temporary changes in demand.

But a transaction in the bitcoin network is different because it's purely just an entry in a ledger. It doesn't actually represent any sort of claim, like say, an entry in a land registry. Or similarly a green piece of paper with numbers on it, you can't redeem it for anything, and it doesn't even make good toilet paper. The point I'm trying to make is that the price commanded by money is fundamentally different than other commodities. It's actually rooted in game theory, and more resembles a speculative bubble that reaches a stable equilibrium (ideally) than anything else. Every other type of commodity has a price rooted ultimately in direct utility. Money doesn't.

I enjoy a good debate, and you're making excellent intelligent points, but let me counter:
The role of proof-of-work is first and foremost the distribution of bitcoins. I'll concede that if you ignore economic incentives, you could theoretically have 100% pre-mine, and the system could function with mining used only for transaction ordering consensus, but in the real world with real economic incentives it wouldn't work. We can't know without asking satoshi, but it seems clear to me that proof-of-work was seen first as a way to simulate the "wasted" effort needed for something to be produced while still remaining scarce, like wampum or gold, or giant carved stones. Using it to also achieve consensus on transfers in addition to the initial production of the units in question is genius, but surely was an idea that came after.

We recognize that, right now, using bits is troublesome because most others aren't yet, however if we then use what everyone else is using, we contribute to the problem instead of making it better. Our goal is to bring bitcoin to the whole world, not just the tiny bitcoin community that exists today. The only way for the community to move to the bits standard is for wallet providers and merchant service providers to push the change though in spite of the short term inconvenience. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will become.
Regarding fees, yes. Over the last several days the bitcoin network has undergone a significant change in behavior, now that it's reached peak capacity. We will be increasing fees in the next app update to compensate, but this is only a temporary fix until everyone else does the same. Long and/or unpredictable confirmation times are now going to be much more common. Sending and receiving is still instant, but confirmation can be significantly delayed.

That's still technically a speculative store of value, even if you only hold it for a few seconds. But in that case the effect you have on the price is negligible, since you're only using it negligibly as a store of value. It's the people who hold bitcoin who affect the price.

I've commented on the dev mailing list. I'm in favor of Gavin's PR. Trying to increase fees with a fixed production quota is an economically illiterate idea. Instead you want to encourage users to voluntarily economize on blockspace with predictable up-front fees (to maintain decentralization). Users pay fees today because of minimum relay fees and miner tx selection rules. These methods are safe, reliable and proven, and also easy and safe to modify and experiment with. Radically changing the behavior of the network with a fixed max blocksize below the demand level present with current fees is an extreme position that is both irresponsible and dangerous.
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:53:25
Could be a UI bug around wiping the wallet and creating a new one without killing the app. I haven't been able to reproduce the issue yet but I will investigate further. The good news is you have to be able to type in the original recovery phrase to wipe it so the funds wouldn't be lost.
You can report bugs with the github issue tracker.

Bad idea, this is something that's important for the whole network to standardize on to avoid inconsistent transaction propagation. It should be raised, but in a coordinated fashion, and with a lead time for bitcoin software providers to upgrade.

If you give out your wallet addresses you give up your transaction history, but new transactions on new addresses afterward are still private. If you give up your master public key you lose all privacy past and future for that wallet.

You want to increase the cost and difficulty of double spends as much as is practical. The more difficult it is, the better for bitcoin. Credit cards are reversible, but it happens rarely enough that merchants accept the cost. The easier it is to double spend, the more it will happen for lower and lower value transactions and the less useful and practical bitcoin will be.

You're talking like someone who assumes [Lombard street]( style finance is the only possible way to build a global monetary system. :)
You can still have loans and banks and deep liquid bond markets all without the need to engage in [maturity transformation]( (fractional reserve being the most extreme example of the practice, effectively a 0-term loan constantly being rolled over) Of course bankers would be nothing more than lowly loan brokers in that case, instead of the masters of the universe they are today with the ability to create money out of nothing.

Bumping fees will work temporarily until everyone else does the same, and we will be doing this.
We use the default BIP32 wallet structure, so there are other tools to let you get a list of private keys and/or sweep the wallet. That said, we also allow you spend unconfirmed inputs, so confirmation delays aren't an issue for day-to-day use. Also we feel that security is much more important, and other wallets and platforms are not built to the same security standards. Don't sacrifice your privacy or security for a little bit of temporary convenience.

In bitcoin you still trust incentives. You trust for instance that the majority of hashing power isn't coordinating to attack the network, because it would cost more than attackers could gain through normal mining. With double spends, you're trusting that the sender isn't coordinating with a significant portion of hashing power to attack you personally. This is a different risk, but it's one that can be measured, and there's no incentive to perform such an attack if the cost of coordination is higher than the expected gain from a successful attack. If there's a ready made method built into the protocol that miners accept by default to coordinate with double spend attackers, that makes bitcoin worse!
@_date: 2015-07-10 01:53:46
Yes, exchanges will need to adjust to the new network behavior, and use services that predict confirmation likelihood, or possibly let you trade but not withdraw until confirmation. Even with higher fees, when everyone else raises fees too, the issue is the same. There's a fixed production quota for confirmations, so demand spikes will always cause delays.
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:14:49
That's a very cavalier position. The bitcoin network has functioned very well until now with a max-block size that's above on-chain transaction demand. If LN reduces on-chain transaction demand, that's wonderful. It would be fool hardy however to radically change the existing network behavior in the mean time with a max-block size below transaction demand.

(There are many historical examples that are both)
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:05:19
What I mean is that you don't have a problem with receiving and spending funds. The merchant is the one who cares about confirmations, and it's their choice to release the goods. Delayed confirmations are going to be a part of the bitcoin experience now that we're at capacity no matter what, so merchants will just have to learn to live with it, like they do with credit card chargebacks, although we will do everything we can to make the experience better.

@_date: 2015-07-23 07:42:27
This is normal market driven behavior that reduces price volatility. When the price is perceived as being high, people who are sitting on gains realize those gains by exchanging their bitcoin for goods or services or other stores of value. When it's perceived as low, they forego goods, services and other stores of value in favor of holding more bitcoin. This reduces the highs and raises the lows.

I'm happy to learn more about these spam transactions. The way we make sure that only valuable transactions are included is through default relay fees, and default miner tx selection rules.

@_date: 2015-07-28 09:49:19
The bitcoin network is changing quite rapidly at the moment. Some nodes are changing their minimum relay fees without coordinating with the rest of the network, spam attacks, etc. We have an update currently in app store review that should handle these issues, and remain flexible to future changes in network behavior.
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:10:21
you can contact support for assistance.
the sender may not have included a very high miner fee, and/or the transaction may be of the "replace by fee" type which are reversible until they confirm, which would explain why it's not being added to your total yet.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:28:07
Now that we're hitting the cap, you're going to have to rethink your business model if it relies on timely and predictable confirmation. Increasing fees will help, but when everyone else increases theirs as well, you're back in the same boat. When the demand level is unpredictable and there's a production quota, fees and confirmation times will be unpredictable.

I agree, and hopefully Gyft will update their policy to reflect the new realities of long and/or unpredictable confirmation times with a bitcoin network that's over capacity.

I think what you're doing is cool and it looks a lot better than many of the other wallets out there. I would recommend you add chain.com and as a block explorer. We're using them when importing private keys not currently in your wallet. Blockcypher is another good one. Also, see how many of those external libraries you can remove. Each one is an additional source of security issues. The less code you have the better. When managing digital cash, security is priority  Be a paranoid obsessive.

We support a hard-fork blocksize increase to be implemented and rolled out as soon as practical. (we think the seg-wit soft-fork will likely gain consensus and take effect even sooner than the hard-fork will be able to, which is great).

No, it just spends the unconfirmed and includes a larger fee with the spend, big enough to pay for both the unconfirmed input and the spend. A few mining pools, notable eligius, will recognize the unconfirmed dependency chain and consider the total fees paid for the chain as a whole rather than each transaction individually. This behavior is also planned to be included by default in bitcoincore probably in the next major version release, so many more mining pools will adopt it.

Just call it hoarding... hoarding is what gives bitcoin or any other monetary commodity it's value. If you want to help bitcoin succeed, the best thing you can do to help is hoard it. By hoarding money, you also help society by not consuming scarce economic resources that you would if you were spending. Hoarding money is how you "give back" to society, by leaving more goods and services for others to consume. Those greedy spenders are the ones who consume and raise costs for everyone else. Billionaires who give away their fortunes are some of the worst offenders in this respect. Hoarders are heroes.

The way bitcoin works, you can't spend only a portion of funds from an address (assuming you aren't reusing addresses for multiple receives). It's all or nothing. You can simulate it by sending change back to the same address, but that's not recommended. Once you import funds from an address, you should create a new one if you want to put some back.
Also your point about checking the balance when you "import a private key" and scan the public address instead makes sense. We will add that.

breadwallet will prefer to spend confirmed inputs first. It only spends unconfirmed if it must, and the next update also calculates child-pays-for-parent tx fees, so that if you get an unconfirmed input with no fee, you can effectively add an appropriate fee yourself when you send it. A relatively small portion of miners will recognize it, but enough that it will typically confirm after a few hours.

Just think it through. If the word "hoarding" is throwing you off, replace it with "saving" or "holding". When you spend money, you consume scarce goods and services, but when you hoard/save/hold your money, you consume less than you otherwise would, leaving more for everyone else.
This is true, yet it's the opposite of what inflationist economists would have you believe. They use the word "hoarding" in an attempt the stigmatize the act of saving. People who amass large fortunes are seen as the ones taking from society, and told they should "give back" when in fact the opposite is true. The people borrowing and spending as much as they can are the ones who take from society. If a rich person spends their wealth, they are taking back, not giving back. When you hold money, you've taken nothing from me, but when you spend it, you compete with me for resources that I also would like to use.

When a central bank targets 4% inflation, that means they target to grow the money supply 4% faster than the economy, a much larger number than just 4% of the current money supply only.
Bitcoin will behave like a growth stock until it becomes the *standard* store-of-value. Gold is no longer the standard that it once was, so it's become more volatile, with a roughly inverse relationship to the public's trust in national currencies, since it's generally been assumed that gold is going to be the alternative standard when the current global monetary system finally falls apart.

Excellent rebuttal to the "bitcoin doesn't scale" crowd.
I think the "UTXO set as of a certain block" argument could be further improved. What if instead of any random block, there were a set of well known checkpoints, with published and widely verified hashes of the UTXO set as of those checkpoints. Then this mode of partial blockchain download would have the same level of security as using the genesis block, since that too is trusted because it is a well known, widely verified value.
@_date: 2015-04-21 08:13:53
This is true, which is why it won't spend unconfirmed whenever possible. At the moment, the most popular bitcoin payment processors will generally accept a payment with unconfirmed inputs, so it hasn't become a problem. If a payment fails, you can always retry it. We do our best to put the wallet user's interests first, though you make a fair point.
You could have eligius pool malate transactions as a matter of policy if you wanted to discourage the practice. Let me know if you ever plan to. It would be an interesting experiment.

luke, when it was discovered that a significant portion of miners were SPV mining, all the people who were doing full verification noticed right away and raised the alarm. This is the same scheme used for trusting that bitcoin-core doesn't contain malicious code. Almost no one can read the code and verify this themselves, but it only takes one person to notice and a handful more to verify the claim when something is amiss. SPV is the same, you can trust that the majority of hashing power is following the rules, because if that ever stops being true, it only takes a small number of observers to raise the alarm.

The "shortcut" we've decided on for breadwallet is SPV security. Unlike other wallets such as bitcoin-core, we've decided *not* to take shortcuts like storing private keys on malware vulnerable, non hardware encrypted systems, just because those systems happen to be in popular use. If you don't feel those tradeoffs are right for your bitcoin needs, then by all means use something you feel is more appropriate.

That's the oft-repeated traditional wisdom. 17th century Spain also believed that keeping silver and gold inside the country by restricting it's export would make them wealthy. Instead they only saw price inflation. You have to remember that money has no value in itself. It's only an abstract representation. By investing, you are consuming scarce resources, leaving few resources available for others, in the hopes of increasing the production of future resources. If you invest, and do a worse job of it than the next guy who would have purchased  those resources had you not, you are not helping anyone. You are destroying value.
As real production grows, a fixed money supply will result in deflating prices. In that situation you will only be able to turn a profit if you can increase future production by more than the average rate of return for the real scarce resources you consume. If you can't do this, you will benefit the economy more by sitting on your money instead of spending it and consuming resources. You will be rewarded accordingly for saving by seeing the real goods and services your money will buy increase.

I don't understand statements like "we can't afford to buy all the stuff we can make" ... doesn't that just mean we're making the wrong stuff? If you make what people can't afford, it means you fucked up and you should take losses, so you have less capital to waste in the future. People *are* consuming, and they will buy your products, if you invest your capital to increase efficiency and produce the same stuff they are buying now, but at a lower cost. Prices going down is effectively the same as a pay raise. Better even since it benefits the people who must spend a larger portion of their income the most.

There are no accounts. A bitcoin wallet is just a collection of private keys.
When the user scans a private key, breadwallet offers to transfer the funds associated with that key into the user's wallet.
A deterministic wallet (which derives all it's keys from a seed value) can't add random other private keys into it's collection. And you wouldn't want to do this anyway since you have no idea if that private key has been exposed to other people, insecure devices, malware, etc...

No computing device is 100% safe. Hacking ARM/Intel, or sneaking something into gcc/clang would compromise pretty much every computing device including dedicated hardware wallets.
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:09:07
It's ironic because your smartphone (iPhone specifically) is the most secure mass market computing device there is, far more secure than desktop/laptop systems. It uses the same malware hardening techniques that dedicated hardware wallets use, app sandboxing and enforced code signatures. It's also hardware encrypted (keys held in the secure enclave) giving you strong protection even if the device is physically stolen. The US DOJ complains publicly that the devices are too secure. They aren't able to access it even with physical possession.
Think of your iPhone as a decentralized 2fa system. You need possession of the device (something you have) and the ability to unlock it with fingerprint or passcode (something you are or something you know). A hardened device that can enforce limited passcode attempts is ideal for storing private keys.
It's wallets that are accessible from the web and desktop/laptop systems that should only be used for small change, as they vulnerable to desktop malware, and web accessible/custodial wallets are vulnerable to phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like.
This was the original motivation for breadwallet, to make bitcoin safe for everyone, not just bitcoin experts and security nerds.

Anyone can install apps built from source on their own devices themselves since Xcode 7.
iOS and OS X platforms, including the security framework, are also open source, based on BSD. 
Only the app store is a "closed" system as you say, where apple enforces guidelines on what apps can be distributed through it. But as mentioned, you can build and install anything yourself, and breadwallet follows the BIP39 (which I co-authored) and BIP32 standards, so you can use your recovery phrase with any other standards compliant wallet app. Although, we strongly recommend against using other wallets and platforms as they are not built to the same security standards.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:18:48

People think their bitcoin is safer when they entrust their private keys to a hosted wallet company, but that service still needs a way to securely authenticate the account owner. Whatever secure method is used can also be used to authenticate yourself directly to the bitcoin network, eliminating counter party risk. No hosted wallet company offers insurance in the event your account is compromised or you connect from an infected computer.
This is the reason that we designed [breadwallet]( to only restore to the same device when restoring from a phone backup. To recover your wallet on a new device requires your backup phrase which users are cautioned to write down and never type into other devices or services.
A malware hardened, locked down, hardware encrypted device, like iPhone secure enclave, we feel is the safest place to keep private keys, apart from paper.

The article mentions 500satoshi fees, but that's below the 1000satoshi per kb minimum relay fee (rounded up to the nearest whole kb). How does that work? Are they combining multiple micro transactions into a single tx? Or do they have a relationship with a mining pool where they can avoid using the p2p network for relaying the tx?
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:48:50
ill repeat, without making assumptions (yes despite the worn wordplay, they are in fact a useful and necessary reasoning tool) you can't make meaningful use of the gossip network. You assume for instance that at least some portion of the network some of the time is not coordinating to attack the user. You assume that non malicious nodes will measure fees as a ratio relative to the size-in-bytes of the tx, that tx likely to be mined will also be likely to be relayed, that nodes follow a first-seen policy when encountering double spends, etc... If these things change, that's ok, we just need to update our algorithms and deploy new software accordingly.

Make sure the wallet is synced. You can see the rolling balance after each tx in your history. It is possible for a previous balance to be shown temporarily while the wallet is syncing.
*edit: user has a recent receive tx equal to the balance difference. One possibility is that an initial send of this amount failed due to tx malleability, and was then re-sent in a second transaction that didn't share any of the same inputs. In this case it's possible that both would show up temporarily (with the first marked as "unverified"), until the wallet determined that the failed tx had dropped off the network. If the two had happened to share any inputs, it would have marked the conflicted tx as "invalid" and not added it to the balance.

Breadwallet handles malleated transactions like a double spend. You will see a second transaction in your history marked "invalid".

This was something that was considered by banks as an anti-mugging tactic when ATMs were being introduced. Entering your pin backward would show a fake nearly empty balance. They decided against it since muggers would almost certainly know about the tactic as well.
As mentioned up thread, ideally you'd want a situation where you can never prove you've revealed all of your funds, and the attacker can never prove you didn't, and nearly everyone uses this method. It looks pretty incriminating if you're one of the only ones using it.

We keep the xpub private, and don't reuse addresses, so a single key compromise at signing typically won't result in loss of funds, although you do have to be careful when deriving keys from the seed that you don't use any sidechannel vulnerable code. Of course we make every effort to defend against any single key compromise as well, like using constant time/power algorithms, and only accessing private keys immediately after authenticating the user, never in the background, so the device is going to be in the user's hand, making side channel attacks impractical.
Yes, the Android security model has all the right pieces now, but the implementation remains to be proven.

If you use your recovery phrase across multiple wallets and platforms, you reduce your security to the lowest common denominator. If for instance you've used it on a desktop system or pre-M android device, or a wallet that doesn't use all the apropriate security features, you're exposing yourself to malware theft.
We think sticking to the default bip32 layout is a nice balance between no lock-in and still discouraging the insecure practice of sharing recovery phrases across wallets and platforms.
@_date: 2016-05-27 03:39:19
1000? Yes. That's about $450k. The FBI paid more than twice that to get access to an older iPhone that was not equipped with secure enclave like all the newer devices are.
No device is perfect, and $1M appears to be about the going rate to develop an exploit (which is typically patched again with the next os update). I suspect developing an exploit for a device like trezor is less, but that's only speculation.
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:53:19
Absolutely. That's why we (breadwallet) implemented a user configurable touch id spending limit, so that an attacker who steals your phone can't empty your wallet using the fake finger attack. If you don't want to even risk a small amount for the added convenience, you can set the limit to "always require passcode"

To make it cold storage, use the method op described, or for more convenience just keep breadwallet on the phone. Between the keychain service, code signatures, and app sandboxing, iPhone is the best protected against malware of the popular computing platforms.

The peers *are* bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin nodes confirm a transaction before relaying it to other nodes.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:14:00
We recommend the process you described for people who want to create a cold storage wallet with breadwallet. Since iPhone is a malware hardened platform, it's a good option for people who aren't comfortable enough to run something like tails on an offline desktop machine. Also iphone is arguably better protected against things like firmware level keyloggers or other malware, although the safest option would be to keep any hardware used offline forever or even to destroy it if you're truly paranoid. Might be worth it for a few thousand coins.

We do plan to add a way to keep transaction metadata. As it is now, everything in your wallet can be restored just from the blockchain, so adding non-blockchain data will mean keeping it backed up somewhere else, and we want that to be transparent to the user, and also secure and private.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:41:47
If you use paper wallets, it's a good idea have a second copy stored somewhere else, in case something happens to one of them.
breadwallet stores your private key in the hardware-encrypted secure enclave on the phone. Your phone is very likely the most secure computing device you own. It's much more secure than a desktop or web wallet. You have strong protection even if your phone is physically stolen. You can just write down your breadwallet recovery phrase and keep that in the safe, in the event you lose the phone or forget your passcode.

What you're misunderstanding is that a currency's value doesn't come from the fact that it's frequently traded. Liquidity doesn't mean it gets traded a lot, it means that it's highly sought after, and has a deep pool of potential buyers. Take gold as an example. The only place I'm aware of where it's still used as a medium of exchange is in Vietnam for real estate deals, yet the monetary value of global gold reserves is something like $8trillion, many multiples of it's industrial use value. Just because a currency isn't traded a lot or often used in exchange doesn't directly affect it's utility as a store-of-value. Now in the case of bitcoin, I'll grant you that there is an indirect correlation, since it's an indicator of adoption, but it's hoarding that actually gives it value - the fact that lots of people want to hold it in reserve and are willing to exchange value to do so, just as with gold or any other currency for that matter.
Put another way, liquidity can't be decreased because too many people want to hold onto something. That's what liquidity *is*. You're confusing liquidity with trade volume.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:28:38
Yes, it says "unverified" when a transaction hasn't been accepted and relayed by the network. Then once other nodes have verified and forwarded it, it changes to "0 confirmations" until it gets into a block. Then each block added on top increases the confirmation count until it gets to 6, after which it just says "sent" or "received"
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:50:12
This is correct. The bitcoin value will always and absolutely should fluctuate. It needs to in order to reflect the ever changing savings preferences of economic actors.
However, this has very little to do with the wild price swings we've seen. That has to do with the difficulty of predicting the chances of, and the rate at which bitcoin will become a major global currency. Spontaneous monetization is essentially an unprecedented event.
@_date: 2016-05-01 22:10:29
We're focusing on making bitcoin secure and accessible to the billions of people who aren't using it yet. Large numbers of these people will never be able to understand arbitrary precision decimal numbers, but they are used to dealing with two-decimal denomination currency.

Changing network relay rules suddenly is an extremely drastic measure. Many wallets will be forced to rush out updates, and even more users will find their software broken until they update. Getting 100% of users to update or reconfigure their software is a long process.

2fa often times only protects agaisnt weak passwords, not malware.
malware can replace the recipient address with the attacker's, or wait for you to authenticate with the second device and then hijack the session and empty your web wallet or hosted wallet account.
Multisig can limit your losses to your daily spending limit, but again won't help if you're getting the recipient address from an infected machine.
You want a malware hardened device to both directly verify the recipient address and sign/cosign the transaction.

That's what we did with breadwallet. We can't trust random p2p nodes to behave correctly or even not to be malicious. This episode helped us make the client more robust and resilient to sybil/DOS attack.

Simplified payment verification isn't centralized. You can download just the block headers (~20Mb) and cryptographically verify that a particular transaction is included in the chain that the highest amount of hashing power was expended to create, even if you can't independently verify the entire chain of transactions all the way back to when the coins in question were created.
[breadwallet]( does this, so you connect directly to the bitcoin network with your phone, no servers, yet the app typically only uses several megabytes of data.

Governments will adopt it when it's their only source of income because no one wants their worthless scrip. There's a story I heard about a guy who started paying employees and suppliers in credit for his concrete company's services when the government currency was failing. The government called him up when people started trying to pay their taxes with it... and instead of putting him in jail, they accepted it as payment... they were desperate for any income they could lay their hands on.
The same will be true of private individuals. They'll accept whatever has value on the market.

Apple claims the secure enclave is secure even if the kernel is compromised (as in a remote jailbreak exploit via the browser). So far with currently known jailbreak exploits, it appears the secure enclave gets wiped in the event of a compromise, but you are correct that nothing is 100%. It's probably a lot easier for a hacker to steal tens of $thousands from your [bank account]( though.

@_date: 2015-02-22 19:42:33
I definitely agree that it's subjective. It's also one of those things where having everyone use the same standard increases the benefit for everyone. There's a lot of consensus for switching to bits but it's not going to happen if we don't push for it, for the very reason I mentioned. There's huge momentum for everyone to stick with what everyone else is already using. The fact that it annoys some people like yourself so much is further evidence that we need to do it now while the community is small, or it will never happen. This is why I'm willing to piss off a few people in the process.

Apple does a pretty good job of locking down the device and preventing malware. For a device holding private keys, you only want it to run code signed by a trusted source. I'm not aware of anyone one doing that for jailbroken phones, but I suppose there's no reason it couldn't be done.

@_date: 2015-02-20 18:40:18
It's important to remember that this is only theoretically possible. In practice, there is literally $billions of incentive to prevent it happening. If an incompatible change is proposed, the code will be designed to wait until something like 95% of all the computing power on the network agrees to switch, and then everyone switches over at exactly the same time, all coordinated through the blockchain. Theoretically, the remaining 5% can continue on as a separate network, but the last time it happened it just went to 100% almost immediately.

Sorry this is a bit confusing. We try to keep the number of options to a minimum. Setting to "always require passcode" disables touch id in the app entirely.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:28:00
That's what we were doing, using the higher fee requirements set by your pool vs most others. But for a typical single input, two output tx, this still results in a fee below 5000 satoshis. These tx are mined with no problem, but with this change they will propagate inconsistently if at all, a much more difficult situation to detect that also reduces the cost of double spend attacks.
That's not so say such a drastic measure isn't warranted by an even worse emergency situation which has no better solutions, but to make those kind of decisions you have to be aware of the costs.

A bloomfilter only narrows the possible addresses that might be yours.

This is precisely why we have a touch id spending limit. The default limit is 1,000,000bits (1bitcoin) after which you must enter your passcode again. This way an attacker can't empty your wallet using the fake finger attack. You can also set the limit to "always require passcode"

"It is assumed that the value of bitcoin is directly dependent on its use for transactions."
Yikes, I should hope not. Although that might be intuitive if you don't think about it too hard, anyone who spends a little time thinking about how money works can see that the frequency of exchange has no direct correlation with a currency's value, gold being one of the best examples of this. Don't confuse liquidity with trade volume.

Fraud and force. Those are the situations in which defensive violence is justifiable. 
In common law or customary law societies, when someone defrauds people, as determined by a judge who is well respected in the community (let the accused pay for further adjudication if he disagrees on this point), then anyone may legitimately enforce the judgement to recover the losses. We can see from real life societies that function this way that no state is needed for this process to be just, orderly, efficient and effective.

Trezor is a great product. I co-authored BIP39 with the trezor guys. It's definitely one of the better solutions out there. It's good about protecting your private keys, although it still has to trust a potentially infected host system for payment addresses. Breadwallet does BIP70 verification of payment requests right on the malware hardened device.

Not sure what you mean by "Sharing recovery phrases is not a security boundary." Recovery phrases must be kept secret. Sharing them across apps and platforms with lower security standards absolutely does affect the security of your funds.

Nobody likes change, I get it.
However we also have to consider what's best for the bitcoin community as a whole. We think it's really important for the community to move together to the new denomination, and for us to never have to change it again. If we don't, we'll hold back bitcoin adoption by confusing new users. The billions of people who have yet to adopt bitcoin are already comfortable with two decimal place currency denominations, and bits will continue to work even if bitcoin replaces every other currency in the world. We even went so far as to adopt it in the logo and app icon. We work on better bitcoin products in order to grow the industry and spread bitcoin to the rest of the world.

breadwallet implements the "default wallet layout" described in the bip32 specification. Mycelium I believe uses bip44, a different wallet layout.
Remember, never type your backup phrase anywhere unless you're restoring your wallet. Other devices and wallets aren't built to the same security standards. Every time you type it somewhere you reduce your security to the lowest common denominator between all those devices and wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:37:03

If you happen to connect to a malicious node, in the worst case they can, with some statistical probability of error, associate some of your transactions with the IP address you use. With that information depending on the attacker's access to the ISP or cell provider, they might be able to associate the IP with your identity.
As I mentioned there are strategies to improve this situation, but that's where they stand at the moment. With a server trusting wallet, your interactions with the wallet providers server are typically private from 3rd parties, but of course you're completly exposed to the wallet provider.

Nope, we're happy to be able to say we're the first.

Hello, if you privately message me the txid, I can investigate. You can find it in transaction details (tap to copy to clipboard)
I doesn't sound like you need a rescan. The transaction is accepted by the network, just not getting into a block for some reason.
**edit: it appears that one of the input (receive) transactions hasn't confirmed yet. Breadwallet will use the oldest inputs first to reduce this possibility, but will use unconfirmed inputs when nothing else is available.
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:07:46
And their private keys too. Breadwallet uses the secure enclave to hold your private keys, which is where your fingerprint tokens are also stored (not the fingerprints themselves, according to apple).
You can read more about it in the iOS security whitepaper: 
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:04:39
There are several edge case fixes that make this far less likely, but a rescan should fix it. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 16:32:59
breadwallet trusts no 3rd party data. all confirmed transactions are cryptographically proven to be included in the blockchain. Placing an invalid transaction into the blockchain with more than a few confirmations would require a 51% attack on the network.

The point of jailbreaking is to compromise the security model of the phone so any code can be run. Any app on a jailbroken phone can access any other app's keychain data, so it's just as unsafe as any desktop or web wallet.

Correct. The bitcoin network verifies and records the ownership and transfer of bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:49:38
Really appreciate the feedback.
- we wanted people to be able to receive payments while the app is still locked to improve security
- you can currently only see the most recent 5 transactions without unlocking, however we will probably only show transactions with fewer than 6 confirmations in the next update. the idea was to be able to quickly check the status of recent transactions without having to unlock
- changing the touch id limit doesn't take effect until the next time you enter your passcode. (agree that's not intuitive)
- you can disable touch id by setting the limit to "always require passcode", any other setting will enable it.
- you can copy a private key to the clipboard and it will work, but we didn't want to encourage it since the clipboard isn't secure.

You can compile the app yourself and run in the desktop simulator, but you are correct that you need a developer account to install on an iOS device.
I've been saying it for months and haven't gotten to it yet, but I do plan to try to get deterministic builds working for iOS. Short of that, the next best option is for 3rd parties to build from source and compare the differences to the app store build to make sure they're just normal build differences and not due to code changes. I'm more than happy to work with anyone who wants to try it. Also, I verify that the app store build is identical to the one I uploaded to apple.

Sorry about that. The easiest fix is deleting the app and reinstalling. (your wallet will automatically be recreated) There's a set of nodes on the bitcoin network that are "tarpitting" clients and not syncing. The upcoming update detects and handles it.

Great minds think alike. This is exactly what it does. You probably tried it out by entering the same wrong passcode multiple times which breadwallet only counts as 1 failed attempt. This way you're less likely to get locked out if you're the real owner but having trouble remembering your passcode.

@_date: 2015-10-05 23:54:58
copied from another post:
Breadwallet handles malleated transactions like a double spend. You will see a second transaction in your history marked "invalid". After one or the other confirms, the remaining one will be ejected from the mempools of connected peers, and then disappear from your history. Your wallet balance will remain available and correct throughout.

There's no danger of MIM since the Bitcoin network is public anyway.
He's right that SPV privacy needs improvement, but there are strategies to help mitigate the issue that we will be implementing such as support for ToR, and increasing bloom filter false positives when nearly synced. It's also useful to remember that this is wire privacy being discussed, not blockchain privacy. So the exposure is temporary and ephemeral. Still a concern we take seriously but lower risk than with blockchain privacy.
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:14:02
I disagree. (but I upvoted you anyway because I think it's a good discussion) 
You absolutely want a locked down, restricted, hardened device to hold your private keys. And who does locked down, mass market devices better than Apple? The last thing you want is to store private keys on a general purpose computing device. (which iOS devices technically aren't since they only run code signed by Apple).
I hate restrictions as much as any geek, but whether you restrict the device yourself or have experts do it for you, it's exactly what you want for holding private keys and preventing malware theft.

bip75 keeps all identity info outside the protocol, and outside the hands of anyone but the party you intend to transact with. bitcoin users want to make sure they are transacting with the right person, and this allows them to do so privately.

Unfortunately, introducing a 3rd party doesn't improve security. The 3rd party still need to securely authenticate that you are the owner of the account, since any transfers are irreversible.
Whatever method they use to securely authenticate you as the owner  can also be used to authenticate yourself directly to the bitcoin network (i.e. a private key stored on a malware hardened, hardware encrypted device, like a smart phone or dedicated hardware device)
@_date: 2016-07-28 00:38:25


I did no such thing.


You are incorrect, and I explained why in my comment. Claiming I'm wrong is not an argument. I stand by my statements. SPV cryptographically proves that the majority of hashing power believes a transaction to be valid. Full validation does not protect against a reversal should the majority of hashing power coordinate to attack the network.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:39:24
I completely agree. It's certainly possible to get one thing right and still get something else wrong. We believe we did get it right though, and stand by the claim that breadwallet is more secure than wallets that don't require boot verification and a hardware encrypted keystore. We felt so strongly about this that we refused to release an Android version for years, until we knew we could meet this minimum level of security.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:16:21

Of course there is nothing that's 100%, but if verified boot fails, the HAL should not decrypt anything that was encrypted following a previously successful verified boot. Or at the very least the user will be warned that the device is compromised and have the opportunity to not continue.

If etc has the same pow algo as eth but less hashing power, the etc chain can be attacked by eth miners. Full validation is no protection. If you follow SPV, eth is the valid chain according to majority hashing power, and you are not subject to etc attacks.

Indeed. This is still the case. You are still free to release your payment address information to anyone who requests it even if you have no idea who they might be or what their motivations are for requesting it.
@_date: 2016-07-23 18:28:08
There's strong reasoning behind it. breadwallets purpose is to help bring bitcoin to everyone in the world who uses money. 
full btc doesn't work even today for people who don't understand arbitrary precision decimals, while bits have two decimal places and will work even if bitcoin absorbs the value of all other currencies. 
It's also important to have one standard so people can trade more easily. That's why we want to encourage the switch to bits now. The longer we wait the more painful the switch becomes as bitcoin usage grows.
I still think in full btc, so I just look at the second comma to the left and imagine it's a decimal point.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:30:27
That's just not how protocols work. It would be like saying that tcp/ip or email might remain a niche. It either wins or disappears completely like the ipx network protocol did. And the network effects in money are far more powerful than even communication protocols.
@_date: 2016-07-28 05:58:46
This is false. As I explained repeatedly to pb1x, SPV provides cryptographic proof that a majority of hashing power believes a tx to be valid. Full validation does not defend against reversal if a majority of hashing power is colluding to attack the network.
@_date: 2016-07-27 22:57:52
I can address the limits of SPV with respect to whichever attack you're thinking of.
If you're talking about a confirmed transaction, SPV cryptographically proves that the majority of hashing power believes a transaction to be valid.
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:58:19
Whoever told you that didn't know what they were talking about, particularly with respect to the secure enclave.

Fees are in theory "voluntary" but if you don't pay them your transaction might not get into the blockchain. Several months back the miners, who decide what to put in the blocks, started lowering their fee expectations since the price of Bitcoin had gone up. Breadwallet now pays lower fees to reflect the prevailing policies of miners.
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:28:20
I agree that the majority of eth miners made the wrong choice. I don't agree that full validation is security agaisnt this. The minority fork is not safe from reversals. This is why Sha256 altcoins can regularly be attacked and sunk by Bitcoin hashing power holders.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:25:48
yes. it will confirm eventually, and on average it will take much less than 2 hours, but block discovery has a random distribution, so occasional long confirmation times are perfectly normal now that the network capacity cap has been reached.
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:31:17
Again you make claims without addressing my arguments. I'll repeat once more. SPV mining proves a majority of hashing power believes a tx is valid. Full validation is no defense agaisnt a majority of hashing power colluding to attack the network.
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:19:36
so we are in agreement. The unsafe, reversible minority fork will be ignored.
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:12:36
It would be interesting if bitcoin miners published partial block solutions so that merchants can see how much hashing power is being spent attempting to confirm a transaction prior to the next block being found. It would be similar to a partial confirmation.

It doesn't sound like you were very close making the investment. Having heard of bitcoin once, and actually understanding the history of money and monetary theory well enough to see it for what it is, are very very far apart.
But don't worry about it too much. You can still buy 1/21millionth of the entire future money supply of planet earth for a few hundred bucks. You missed buying manhattan for a quarter, but you can still buy an entire city block for a few dollars. All you have to do now is resist the urge to sell it for a paltry few thousand a few years down the road when it's still only barely begun to catch on. 
If you're selling when not even the populace of one country has ditched their state currency and moved all their finances into bitcoin, you're selling way too early.

@_date: 2015-10-13 20:35:57
You are confused. Relay policy is of course configurable, and wallets can't rely on any particular node following the standard, however all wallet software *must* make assumptions about prevailing policy for the network as a whole. Changing that suddenly network wide will necessarily cause disruption. For the network to be useful for relaying transactions, there needs to be generally consistent, predictable relay policy.

Breadwallet uses SPV, not full blockchain verification. My argument is that full verification is unnecessary, even for receiving very large amounts. It's only needed for mining. SPV in practice provides the same level of security for non-mining clients. Full validation can prevent you ending up on an invalid longer chain, but if an attacker can create a longer invalid chain, they can also create a longer valid chain that rewrites history. full validation cannot protect against this. Bitcoin relies on the majority of hashing power not colluding to attack the network, and SPV can cryptographically prove a tx is considered valid by a majority of hashing power.
Regarding the SPV mining issue that happened at the soft fork activation. Those who were SPV mining lost block rewards, and the invalid blocks they mined were also empty. Even the coinbase tx wouldn't have been valid until 100 blocks had been built on top.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:12:30
breadwallet and bitcoinj are using SPV directly with bitcoin nodes with something called a bloomfilter. The privacy isn't as good as running a full node, but if you connect to a malicious node it can only identify your addresses with some probabilistic margin of error, so you at least get plausible deniability.
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:31:58
It's certainly not meant to degrade other teams. I would clarify that breadwallet the most secure *mobile* wallet, and that claim is simply made because it requires a device that has hardware encryption and boot verification (Android M or iOS)
using a dedicated hardware wallet is an excellent solution as well
regarding the recovery phrase, we wanted to cover the situation that a user isn't in a convenient situation to write down their phrase, so we felt a reminder later on would be an improvement over requiring it be written down immediately
@_date: 2016-07-05 23:10:37
Slippery slope? There's no trade-off here, it's a strict improvement. It makes address re-use much easier to avoid and provides a secure private method to exchange payment info. And you're incorrect about non-protocol BIPs. This is an extension to BIP70, and wallet standards are a well accepted subject for BIPs.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:22:41

It never occurred to me that people might think that if it doesn't ask, it might remove them without asking.
We will probably remove that option entirely in the next update, it's confusing and doesn't do anything in most cases since most transactions aren't high enough priority. Also transactions without fees are starting to take longer to confirm on average.

You are correct that SPV doesn't detect if majority hashing power starts following different rules. However if you can't trust the majority of hashing power, the security of the network falls apart. History can be rewritten. Full validation is no defense. I'm arguing that is safer for non-mining clients to follow the majority fork. This is a value judgement and it's okay to disagree.
In the case of eth, you want the most valuable fork, which will have the most hashing power, even if you disagree with the decision to fork. (I don't use or own eth, but I do think forking was the wrong way to go, and I'd still rather be holding eth)
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:03:27
I would, those are great examples. Although in the case of tide, the monetary use is still small enough that it doesn't significantly affect the market price. Prison cigarettes do, but only inside the prison.

@_date: 2015-02-01 05:36:41
I'm the author of a popular [wallet]( and this is actually an interesting idea. To get down to minute resolution, you could set a transaction to confirm in, say, 6 blocks using nLockTime, and then after 5 minutes or whenever you want it could replace the transaction with a non-postdated version to "finalize" it. Or you can cancel it by replacing with a transaction that "spends" the coins back into your wallet. (You'd still need to pay the miner fee even if you cancel)
The tricky part would be getting all the wallet implementations to handle postdated transactions in a reasonable way. Now I think several will warn the recipient that you're trying to rip them off with a transaction that can get canceled, or they just won't register it all until it's no longer reversible.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:05:32


You don't buy a single bit, it's too small. Just like you don't buy a single yen. Hundreds of millions of people use currencies with small denominations.


BTC is a huge denomination and is going to get much, much larger as it catches on, so it can't be the standard if we want to bring bitcoin to everyone. It's too exclusionary. 
There are large numbers of people who don't understand more than two decimal places. These are the kind of people who will tell you they have no internet access, yet they use facebook on their phone. Those people use money too.


That would be better if the goal is to eliminate short term annoyance, but you have to consider the longer term cost of perpetuating a denomination that will hurt bitcoin growth by being unusable for large portions of society.

Bitcoin is a network protocol for recording ownership of scarce digital tokens. The protocol's value tied to how many people are using it, so the incentive is for everyone to standardize on the same one (just like with email or tcp/ip). Also the tokens themselves are a monetary commodity, so they have the monetary network effect where everyone wants to hold the thing that everyone else wants to hold. This is the same reason why people want green paper with numbers on it even though they can't do anything with it except trade it to someone else.

Your wallet can be recovered from iCloud backup, but only on the same device used to create it.
As is clearly stated, if you lose your phone, you will need your recovery phrase to recover your wallet.
This also means your funds are secure should your iCloud or iTunes backups be compromised. Breadwallet security is comparable to a dedicated hardware wallet. It uses the same security model of boot chain verification, hardware encrypted key store, app sandboxing, and enforced code signatures.
Think of your phone as decentralized 2fa device, but instead of authenticating to a wallet providers servers you are authenticating directly to the bitcoin network. Factor one is posession of the phone (something you have) and factor two is the ability to unlock it with fingerprint (something you are) or passcode (something you know)

SPV is hard. Took about six months to implement and get working well, but I open sourced it so I hope more people use it. Bitcoinj is the only other working implementation I'm aware of.
Hive may have multiple other services it uses as fallback, I'm not sure. You could still recover your funds in another wallet with your  recovery phrase. The main concern is that you have to trust those servers to validate transactions you receive, while with SPV you are cryptographically validating right on your own malware hardened device.
@_date: 2016-07-22 18:11:26
You are correct about hardware encryption *alone*. This is why you also need verified boot. You have a OS that is trusted by the hardware chip, that will only allow requests from the same app that put the key in the keystore to start with.
