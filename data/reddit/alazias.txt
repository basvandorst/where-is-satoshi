By whining that Bitcoin should be called "Bitcoin Core", Roger is trying to disassociate the Bitcoin brand. Whether one follows the "ORIGINAL SATOSHI VISION" or not is largely irrelevant... it comes down to which side maintained the majority of development teams, market share, and hashpower.
Trying to then rebrand Bitcoin Cash as "Bitcoin" is deceptive and does nothing other than bring confusion to adoption.

Yeah they may want your money, but traders who were shorting also probably triggered a lot of stop-buys as they try to reduce losses, which just compounded the volume and price increases.  Might have been partly because of exchange manipulation, but also a consequence of so much shorting over the past several months.

Doesn't it seem logical that whatever fork contains the largest portion of the original development team that existed PRIOR to forking should be considered the original?  Unless the team is purposely creating a new coin, it seems reasonable to say that those developing it should indicate "original" from a semantics standpoint.

Dictating original team or not gets murky fast with how open source project development tends to go.  I was merely referring to the current development team prior to a fork. 
I get what you're saying about Satoshi returning though.  It would obviously cause a lot of confusion if he/they didn't stick with the current development of "Bitcoin".

So, are these short squeeze sales something that was already set up beforehand by those that were shorting? It is a bit crazy that all of that volume happened within a 15 minute time-frame.
Seems like a less intense inverse of the ridiculous "discount ETH" crash that happened last year because of stop-losses.

But what if the true vision that Sony had was for Playstation to become more than a game? Polystation clearly says it's "just not a game anymore!"
