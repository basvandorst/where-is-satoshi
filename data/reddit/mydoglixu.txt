Can you explain more? Also, does this mean they're pulling out, or just dumping so the price goes back down and they can buy in again at a discount and make more money?

Yeah, I guess I'm just looking for some method behind the madness. But if we knew that, we'd also know the future.

Why is it that the price charts are so similar? I look at coinbase and while the prices aren't exactly the same, it's uncanny how closely they follow a similar path more often than not.

 I've been starting to wonder if this market is becoming overrun by bots. I'm seeing the same patterns over and over for the past 2 months.

Anyone know if Coinbase will be getting on with Bitcoin Cash soon?

I agree. And regardless of any opinion over CoinBase's decisions, the fact that it has so much reach as a company, and it has chosen LTC as one of its very few coins, I think makes a big difference in adoptability into the market overall.

I only invest what I'm prepared to lose. I hate myself for not investing EVERY time I saw it about 4 years ago. Then I started thinking I'd be some cool day-trader and I have learned my lesson more than once.
I bought a few here and there recently and the dollar-cost averaging approach is the only one that holds any water. For me, I can lose all of my coins and still be fine in life, so if it goes down whatever. If it goes up, I'll make out decently, but not as well as if I had NOT  waited back when BTC was $100/btc.

I've been wondering the same thing. I'm a little late to the game, but just started buying up some LTC. I haven't seen any real historical connection between LTC and BTC price, and obviously they operate independently, but I'm curious how far it could go.

Dont sit on floor.

I wonder what it hit.

Make that $79.20
