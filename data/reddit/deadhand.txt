I'm starting to get rather annoyed with Newegg. First they start advertising graphics cards for *bitcoin* mining.. I mean, are they trying to make people lose money?
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:22:38
You can lose a huge quantity of cash rather quickly too. It's called a fire.
The difference is is that those private keys can be replicated and stored elsewhere, so if something catastrophic occurs locally, it's not necessarily the end of the world. It just requires a little bit of fore-though.
To be honest though, I think additional services / applications will make it much easier to store and manage private keys in the future.

Oh yes, I agree. However, it will likely be a while before the price starts to seriously rise again (by more than 20% or so).
Anyway, I just wish that our community wouldn't go into other subreddits and promote dogecoin whenever another crypto (mainly bitcoin) begins to lose value or is in trouble in some way. :)

The only problem is that most unconfirmed transactions tend to get confirmed, whereas Newsweek's piece will never be confirmed.

As a member (or soon to be ex-member, if I keep seeing shit like this) of the dogecoin community, I'm rather annoyed by posts like these. If you're going to tip, at least be generous.

Cryptorush isn't a "scam exchange", it's just really, really, really badly designed, and as  a result they were hacked.
Many of us from the altcoin community could see this shit from a mile away, though. Stay away from sketchy exchanges, or only do very small deposits before trading and pulling *everything* out!

I'd sooner believe that he actually is jesus than for him to use a poor password, haha. Also, what motivation is there for someone to hack into his account just to post that?
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:12:41
Yeah. I mean, it's in no way any guarantee that an exchange is actually safe. But damn. Vircurex looks like hell. I think it was fairly clear that they weren't really interested in putting money into developing the exchange, and most developers aren't experienced with penetration testing, which would therefore require that they actually hire outside consultants / whatever to test for security holes.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:21:09
If he's smart enough to conceive of the Bitcoin protocol, would he be stupid enough to use a poor password? Hmm...
What could be more likely is that he's trying to deceive the press to get them off his back.

of danger?
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:00:27
Sure, but you have to realize people can do incredibly stupid things when they're under a lot of stress. Most people would have a great deal of difficulty holding their shit together if nearly half a million dollars was stolen. Another problem is that Bitcoin's price will likely begin to rise again in a few months, and when this happens, those losses will become much more difficult to deal with.
The exchange wasn't initially a scam, but they began to behave as such when they were forced into a very difficult situation.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:12:57
Tip: If an exchange is too cheap to have a decent site layout and design, they're probably too cheap to have penetration testing done as well.
Not bullet proof, but can give you an idea of the quality of an exchange. (literally just by looking at it.)

PoS is necessary long-term regardless if there are to be no ill-effects experienced by decreasing block rewards in the far future.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:28:11
I'd think that we'd also see a culling effect on the least efficient miners. As more efficient and powerful mining hardware becomes available, less efficient miners will be forced off the network, therefore reducing the average watt/Mhash.
The 7/s transaction limit is apparently to prevent bloat on the blockchain (dust transaction attacks, etc.). This is apparently going to change (or is liable to change) when the network becomes more widely used. However, this will also probably mean that full nodes will only be able to operate on more dedicated servers, as opposed to desktop computers and laptops as we can right now, as the blockchain is expected to bloat as the network is more heavily utilized.
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:17:30
What's the point of heavy physical security if you can just completely skirt around it through social engineering?
Sure, perhaps there was something they could have done on the server to better secure the hot wallet (note that they only had the hot wallet cleared - at least the BTC in cold storage was safe), but this doesn't change the fact that Rogers fucked up royally.
Also, what's the point in encrypting a hot wallet? It has to be accessed by other software, so that other software must contain the keys to access it. All the hacker has to do then is to get access to those keys, no?

The problem with upvoting / downvoting is that it gives equal opportunity to all users, which isn't necessarily a good thing. The more moronic posters may simply upvote/downvote without thinking, and therefore do so more frequently, whereas those who actually think it through might do so less frequently due to the disproportionate amount of effort intrinsically involved.
We may characteristically be giving disproportionate voting power to morons beyond just the ratio that was described above, of which there is already an abundance.
What may help would be to find a way to incite intelligent discourse. Create threads that challenge people to think and discuss, and not just trigger upvote-fests. Might not work very well at first, but over time we may see a change in culture, which I think is ultimately what we really need if we're to see more intelligent discussion overall.

Yes, ~314 bitcoin being worth more than 1 share of BRK-A. This does not infer that 1 bitcoin would be worth more than 1 share of BRK-A. If Berkshire is 20% greater in price over what it is now, then Bitcoin would have to outperform and be 20% over the current price as of that bet, and then some in order to out-perform Berkshire-A.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:15:06
Who the hell is downvoting this thread?
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:26:53
The bet isn't that it will be worth more than $185,000. The bet is that it will outperform Berkshire stock in terms of percentage increase. i.e, the price would increase by more than 20% (assuming that Berkshire continues its current trend of a 20% increase in price again this year).
Markets are about scaling. Prices of individual stocks / currency is mostly irrelevant, provided it increases in value. A stock that's 10$ and increases to 12$ is just as good as a stock that's 100$ and increases to 120$. If you'd buy 10x as much as the 10$ stock as you'd buy of the 100$ stock, you'd do just as well. The percentage return is the same. What is relevant, however, is market cap. That's the total number of shares in circulation multiplied by the price of any given share.

If the network were to reach VISA levels of transaction rates (say, 4,000 transactions per second) then you'd have 240,000 transactions per minute, or 2.4 million transactions every 10 minutes. Since the average block time is 10 minutes, we can then assume that 2.4 million transactions could fit in a single block (which is technically feasible, if I understand correctly.)
If it costs 333$ per block, then it costs 1$ for 7207 transactions. This is about 1 cent for 72 transactions. Not bad.
Of course, the initial major % distribution of coins is still on-going, so these electrical costs are being subsidized through block rewards. Over time, as it becomes less profitable to mine, we may expect that the network hashrate will drop to accommodate decrease in profitability. Thus, it will likely cost *less* to operate the network in the future than it currently does, as mining profitability begins to hug electrical costs. This will run the risk of losing some network security.
Now, when the network hashrate drops, we'll end up with a 'tragedy of the commons' effect. In turn, the network will become less secure, and we'll probably be forced to switch to a more efficient method of securing the network. Bitcoin, in my opinion, will probably one day become a proof of work / proof of stake hybrid. Proof of stake is highly efficient, but not useful for initial coin distribution. However, it may be a very valuable option for the future when the majority of the initial coins have been released, because of the near-negligible cost of securing the network.
Essentially, what she's complaining about is that those who are currently mining the coins have to exit some capital from the market to give to electrical companies. However, this is also sort of a good thing, because it prevents excessive hoarding by mining operators, and provides some liquidity to the market.
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:32:56
Sort of. However, they're quite independent. The 'cost' of mining a single block isn't really related to the number of transactions that will be included in it. We have a very powerful and secure network, but it's sort of underutilized, essentially.
Granted, another mistake she makes is assuming that the only purpose of mining is to secure the network. This isn't really true. It's also a mechanism for distributing the initial supply of coins, which is fairly important.

Except it wasn't 'hosting' in the traditional sense. They had their servers in the datacenter, but the servers weren't actually owned by Rogers. Rogers was just supplying security (lol) and providing a facility that the servers could operate in.

I hope Rogers gets seriously burned for this.
Rogers is well known for screwing customers, anti-competitive business practices (targetting Tek-savvy, in particular, which they seem to view as a threat, and for good reason), oversubscribing their networks (causing frequent disconnects with DOCSIS), employing low data caps and charging 2$ per GB overage, throttling bit torrent connections, and false advertising pertaining to connection speeds. They're also extremely over-priced, as with the other two major ISPs in Canada.

You could split the rewards to 2.5 BTC / reward and have 1 minute blocks. Problem with more frequent blocks (and thus more frequent rewards) is that it will bloat the blockchain and increase the probability of getting orphaned blocks.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:55:39
Yet wasn't really their fault. Blame can be put on Rogers Communications on this one for ignoring their own security practices. Facility has retinal scanners and keypads to access the servers, yet no authentication to have the server rebooted when discussed over an online chat? Ridiculous.
EDIT: Here's the article I was referring to that mentioned this:
"In order to check the servers himself, he needed to call two hours in advance to alert Rogers officials about his visit. He then needed a key card to enter the building, enter the lobby, activate the retinal scanner, pass through two more sets of locked doors and then he had to provide a numeric code to unlock the padlocked gate on the cage of his servers.
His experience was the complete opposite of the fraudsters."
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:43:06
Yeah, I'm saying it'll approach optimal efficiency. The major source of this 'culling' would be from decreased block rewards, however.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:30:01
Yes, which was apparently related to the 424k BTC that was shifted around a couple years ago to prove gox's solvency. The ~180k (or 200k) BTC that moved around the other day that was split up apparently followed a similar pattern to what the code in Mt. Gox system would have done, strongly suggesting that it was moving through their system.
