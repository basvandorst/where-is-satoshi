I was transferring 1.05443892 BTC from one wallet to another.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:45:02
MtGox must be having fun.  By original transaction has disappeared and I am now part of another failed transaction.  The good news is that it appears to be issue they are dealing with.

Don't they need electricity for that?

It is a hedge against local currency devaluation.   As you pointed out not a very stable one at the moment.  But as/if bitcoin matures it will become a better one.
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:56:12
Can't we just drone it?
@_date: 2016-10-17 14:10:22
You sir are experiencing one of the main reasons to own bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:37:41
Who technically owns these coins?  What would prevent an author from running off with the loot?
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:44:28
I was close to that with MtGox
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:27:39
I made a couple grand off the 1200 spike back in the day, and got my remaining bitcoins out MtGox just in time.  Could have done better but,  didn't think of looking for a US exchange.  took about a month and a few bank fees to get my funds overseas.  I was already depressed that the price when from 90 to 200 =p.  
Way back in the day I setup a bitcoin miner on a pc.  Would have been nice if I keeped it running, or at-least backed it up.  I have been haphazardly keeping a finger in with not looking to much under the hood.

How long does it normally take to sync block chain? (I assume, that I would have to be insync to be able to do a transfer.
Also do I just backup the folder to keep my wallet, or are there key files that I can save?
