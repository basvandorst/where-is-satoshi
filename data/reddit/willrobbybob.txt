i have some experience, not the most efficent way to get coins. you dont make alot, if bitcoins spike to like 1000,000 you'd be making good money. .....dont rule it out. 
 here is a website where you can watch video's for coins 
and here are two where you can visit websites for coins
then here are just some free btc sites
goodluck

there are some that will just give out small amounts of free BTC.... then there are some where you can do little tasks for them, but as i am badger said, it's small.  but it is something and could be worth alot more down the road.  here are some links to follow for a little free btc.
this is a cool one where you answer super easy q's after viewing a website for btc.
you can watch video's for coins here, super easy, just have the window on another tab whilst you search
here you can visit websites for coins without questions at the end. % mins though.\

ya dude, although full disclosure im getting paid to tell you where they are by the sites.
if your really trying to get btc without paying for it, the much more efficient way to get it is to add some sort of value that you can monitize to the community, aka a service you can charge btc for
