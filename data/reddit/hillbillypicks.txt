Heres a thought exercise, even if segwit is fully adopted, how many Transactions can btc handle a day without the current backlog problems? What would average fee be right now with full adoption?
Is it enough to take back alot of the lost of market share? Could it come even close to the 1 million transactions that ETH just did today?

Only if those customers are dumb enough to sell whole bitcoins on coinbase, instead of gdax, an actual exchange.

Transacted coins. 99% of coins are older then a day. Just aren't moved often. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:11:48
Well yes, but that's not what you said. 


Also nothing preventing these older coins from moving. In fact if they want to be used they will have to moved at one point.

No but the banks money still in fiat is worth less now. Thats the whole point. As they buy 1b, then 2b, the next 4b buys a decent amount less. Problem for them is, can they get the money in quick enough, to not lose to much value on the FIAT that the vast majority of their wealth is in.
Weve been showing how hard it would be to buy 6.5B, but how much does the bank actually have backed in fiat. If bitcoin was to replace fiat, or the USD was to crash, how much of that fiat could they get into bitcoin before it was worthless and couldnt buy more then a few satoshi?

A 5% increase per day you bought 10m would be significant. Since your doing it 300 days before your half way to the 6.5b number you were claiming wouldnt raise prices much. Go on gdax and see how much the price would be to actually buy 10m worth. (hint the price would rise alot more then 5%).
I would love 5% every day for a year. It would significantly increase my stacks worth.

So that would take you 3 years of buying on gdax if price stayed put. Spread a few more exchanges maybe cut it down to a year. You only bought 1b. 
 
Good luck buying 6.5b without affecting the price. A
Prices won't be as low as they are now in 6 months even.

You do not realise how many millions are in 6.5 billion. 
Even if you could buy 20m a day it would take you nearly a year to spend 6.5b.
You could not spend even 10m a day without significantly effecting price.

Obviously you can spread out buys and lower your impact of buying. Obviously its smarter to wait for large dips to buy larges amounts. 
Your wrong about the liquidity of the market. Their just is not enough to buy even 50m on the biggest days and no have a 10-20% impact on the price. You would have to do this 130 times still to get to 6.5B. Today if you tried to buy just 10m on gdax, the price would incease 20%. 
How much of the 40m worth of volume on gdax is people just selling and not day trading? Could you even really buy half of it? Was 40m worth sold? or was 20m worth sold twice?
In any way of buying 6.5b worth of bitcoin in 1 or 2 years you are going to significantly raise the price. That was the claim people are arguing, not that you cant buy a large amount over time. Its just you cant buy that large of an amount without having an effect. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:04:48
Not if someone is buying billions of them in that time frame. 
If someone was pumping 10m a day into bitcoin, in an effort to buy 6.5b worth, its practically impossible for the price to go down. All other demand would have to plummet, as your buying practically all new supply, but why would it with an increasing price from the buying.
