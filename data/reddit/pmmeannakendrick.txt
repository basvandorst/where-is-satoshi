the bitcoin was free... I'm investing in other cryptos, so I'd like to consolidate, but I'll just hodl what I have in BC and maybe add a little here and there.

What does that even mean?

That's what I thought, but being new to this, I wanted to confirm. Thanks for taking the time to answer!

US money hasn't been backed by gold since the 1930s. It's created when they need more money in circulation.
At least bitcoin has a finite amount available, spread over time.

re-read my comment. Vote by proxy isn't a vote. The Fed is very much privately owned - proof is in the "board" which is inherently a private business term. If you are going to imply we vote in the FED at least make a case. No one controls the fed, but the fed. All the other countries simply don't mislead others as you feel you need to - are you a shill of some sort, you sound it.

If you bought in at the latest dump around 9k, you'd be back up to 11k now.
Logic like this doesn't work with an increasing limited commodity.

DB Cooper is Satoshi. It makes perfect sense. Both made a large sum of money (in their time) under an alias, and then disappeared.

We don't vote on the fed reserve. They are a private institution contracted by our government since the 1930s. Voters have no say whatsoever.

Yes, you are correct, but the Federal Reserve is private, we don't vote on it, it isn't run by congress, or the white house. Voting doesn't effect the private entity that is the Federal Reserve.

the President of the United States, without the people voting.
Since the President is voted using the electoral college, and the primaries determine the candidate for each party, without any guidance or oversight, you cannot say we "elect" the federal reserve. We barely "elect" a president, who once in office makes their own decision, not those of the people.

So you are implying that we all get a say in the FED? Honestly, are you that shortsighted?

I'm pretty new, but everything I've read says do a small test of an amount you aren't afraid to lose, before any large transactions.
Sorry this happened, there is a risk, but it's much smaller if you take the safest possible route.

sorry I missed this, could've used it.
