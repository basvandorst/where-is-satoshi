This was an excellent read. Good recap of how people have lost their wallets in the past.

This is a misleading title. They seized a payment account. Not the exchange itself.

They may very well be. Someone is getting the gains other than you, so it probably doesn't matter who.

I'm wondering if this is just a firmware upgrade. If so, how long before it's available (leaked) without a $100 upgrade charge.

I have the same issue with one of my orders from 4/26. I emailed as well and got no response. Let us know what you find out.

It would cause an immediate uproar and people would stop using Facebook in droves. People don't generally like to be taken advantage of.

Is Coinbase's BTC price tied to Gox?

Dang. I was hoping it wouldn't come back this time.

I don't think it'll become mainstream in the US for some time to come. My guess is that some 3rd world country will have an economic crisis and the people won't have faith in their local currency. They will search for alternative that they believe will hold it's value and be easy to hold, transfer, and spend. Bitcoin would be a likely candidate for such a group of people if the barrier to entry is low enough so that they can easily acquire and exchange the currency at that time.

Nice haul! You won't have to buy shirts for a couple months.

I think he did a pretty good job of explaining things in a way those most people who watch Bloomberg could understand. 
Props for not going radical and ragging on the government.

I'm not a fan of the interface and I'm hoping we end up with the trade volume spread out between more exchanges.

I agree that 10% is high under certain circumstances. 
My current hash rate on a set of GPUs is 1500 MHz/s
Currently I'll earn a little over 2 BTC and make about $242 a month. 
The rig and fans run about 800 watts (1.88 MH/s/W - not very efficient) not counting additional AC.
My power costs @ $0.06/kWh are a total of $35.06 a month.
Power accounts for 14.45% of my costs, not to mention the extra AC. 
I know that ASICs are much more efficient (around 160 MH/s/W) but in most cases you still need to run another PC for the mining software and additional fans, cooling, costs for breakdowns. ASICs in this range would have costs for power below 1%. That's pretty amazing for the time being. 
So, in analyzing this, I think that if you are fortunate enough to get your hands on some ASICs now, there is a good deal to be made in the short term. If you cannot, paying a 10% fee to have a contract with someone who does, probably makes more sense than GPU mining.

The hardest thing to wrap your head around is that Bitcoin is deflationary. Therefor your purchasing power will be more tomorrow than it is today. So by paying upfront for something you'll receive at a later date (pre-ordering) you're basically handing over the deflationary gains to BFL. It's the opposite for the dollar.

I don't blame them. I wouldn't even blame them for doing it today, tomorrow, or in the next ten years. The US dollar is fairly stable compared to anything else including Bitcoin. Although, the US isn't immune to economic troubles that cause the value of the dollar to fall. Hense the moves in and out of Gold and other precious medals. 
I wouldn't suspect that Bitcoin would be the primary currency of any country in the near future, but if you're trying to move your wealth from your local currency to anything else that you trust more, maybe you can't easily get ahold of dollars, euros, or gold. Maybe bitcoin is more accessible.

Looks pretty awesome. Any USB ports on there? How much does it weigh?

That's pretty neat. Good luck with the startup!

Many have a cell phone. There's not much more needed.
