What is the ratio of schmeckles to Schrute bucks?

I like Gemini. They allow you to trade with your deposit before it clears and there are no fees for bank ACH deposits or withdrawals. You do have to get verified by them though, and I guess some people have had trouble with that. I didn't have any problems.

I would go with Electrum. Easy to use but very secure and you can control how much to pay in fees. Click the "getting started" link on the sidebar then click "choose your wallet". You can compare features for a lot of different wallets there.

Why do you hate bitcoin and want to destroy it by reporting facts?
~~We have always been at war with eastasia~~ Bitcoin has always been intended as "virtual gold".

google "restore bitcoin wallet from seed".
Like others are saying, do not tell anyone the 12 words.

ID verification, like a driver's license. Because of anti money laundering laws they have to know who you are before you can deposit USD.

Didn't you read the comment? *People in Chinese government* confirmed it. Dump your bags, everyone, this is the end of crypto. Very legitimate.

But you... you just...
Nevermind, I'm more interested in knowing if the bullets are silver and that's what you meant by "I also have silver". Does your SHTF scenario involve possible werewolves?

Kinda hard to know what might be considered controversial these days

The silver bullet market is volatile. You gotta hodl, man.

Can you elaborate on the extra hoops. Even just some leads for what to google would be welcome. I know about the fork and want to eliminate technical/social obstacles. What do I need to know?

Since [August of 1971]( the US dollar has been "fake money". Bitcoin is just as fake but it is designed to work without having to trust a central bank to not screw you over.

It's turtles all the way down.

I don't let it keep me up at night but there is no money you can count on. Literally anything used as an exchange of value could become worthless overnight.
Barter is legit.

I appreciate the reply!

Look at GDAX fee structure. (GDAX and Coinbase are the same company)
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:18:07
Small if true!
