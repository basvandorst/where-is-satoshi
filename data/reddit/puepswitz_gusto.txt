This ^
When these chips reach critical mass the consumer data will be so valuable that 21 will be able to cover whatever mining inefficiencies consumers are experiencing. At which point a large number of consumers wouldnt mind mining at all, they would even ask to mine. 21 could even go a little further "you like the couple of cents your making? Why not upgrade to our NFC enabled chips and make some real money". Now your refrigerator can data mine everything you eat with the right food packaging. Thats just a small example.

I dont know how broad it can be when were sitting at 132k subcribers while has 4.2M... a talking duck that gives advice gets more attention than we do. Dont get me wrong, im a big supporter of the crypto-currency movement, I hodl in my own way. I think once the Wink ETF gets approved well all be throwing coins at each other on the moon. In other words...chill out and check out that receptionist hahaha.
