Haha, our coin is broken! It must be that other coins fault that’s working correctly

Your analogies do not make sense. During Dec 2017 when our beloved BTC broke, merchants switched to BCH. For 0.03btc per coin it’s sensible to hedge.

BTC 1mb bottleneck incoming!! Tx's are up to near ATH, fee's will rise soon, 3 days confirmations times. I'm grabbing the popcorn.

You can still use BCH in many places, and it doesn’t have a scaling issue right now. BTC is on the verge of complete failure right now, it’s on its transaction limit, anymore and it will be Dec 2017 all over again. Fingers crossed we get people onto LN ASAP. And LN works. 
Try not to be too emotional everyone, I love both coins and we’re all brothers in crypto land x

Guys nobody has tricked anybody, it’s just an objective look at the facts. BTC can’t scale in its current state, all our eggs are in the same basket with LN, if it doesn’t work it’s game over.
BCH scales to a decent level right now, it’s obviously not centralised because the consensus is identical to BTC.
I would prefer BTC to succeed because that would be better for crypto as whole, BCH is here ready and waiting to process transactions for a peer to peer cash system.

There’s nothing centralised about a hard fork, the point of a hard fork is that people can go a different way, like when BTC hardforked from bitcoin (bch).
If LN is widely used it would make it very difficult for a hard fork, putting power in developers rather than miners as satoshi intended. I don’t want to start a shouting match but majority of people on reddit need further education

It won't be worth very much at all unless LN is up and running, 100% reliable, not relying on watch towers or central hubs and integrated into wallets before the next Bullrun.
Another catastrophe like Dec 2017 will kill BTC. Fingers crossed it all gets sorted in time.

Buy 1 BCH for $100 just as a hedge against LN being a failure. That way you’ve covered both bases in the blocksize debate

The bottleneck of 1mb blocks was literally proven to you in Dec 2017. You are either very new, retarded or delusional yourself.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:36:26
Yeah, then decrease blocksize to cripple Bitcoin even more. That will really help mass adoption
