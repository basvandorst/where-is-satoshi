In Venezuela is much different, we have 2 exchanges, and of course localbitcoins.com for tourist is easy to get a DNI (depending on their nationality)

There isnt, and It wont go back up (Although they are some economist that say it will), the only reason that I have Venezuelan currencies is for my monthly expenses, everything else go to BTC, Peercoin or USD.

Venezuelan here! Absolutely does! Is actually the only way to buy things overseas and airplane tickets.
We have a good exchange, one of the biggest in Latin-America [surbitcoin.com](
We have a receptive and really cool comunity.
If he is scared of the bitcoin volatility he can use [uphold.com]( If he doesnt like exchanges he can use [localbitcoins.com](
The first time that I buy bitcoins it cost me 40000VEF/BTC (2 years ago) now it cost 435000VEF/BTC and it will go up. I dont have a state bank account so it is the only way that i can Buy on amazon or other places.

Kind of sucks, 2MBPS if you are lucky, there is some really lucky guys whit 10MBPS, but the median is 2MBPS, more than enuff for BTC transactions.

I konw, specialy the unpredictable part, but i the case of peercoins the have "check points" in case something bad hapend, in the case of bitcoin we still could have proof-of-work in case something bad hapend, i'm not talking about a 100% POS coin, but at leats a way to reward nodes and move foward mor descentralization

In the case of dashcoin Masternodes are decided by having a big amount of dashcoin in the node.
