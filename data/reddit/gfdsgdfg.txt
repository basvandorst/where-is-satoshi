The great thing about dollar cost averaging is you get to buy a lot when the price is low, and only little when the price is high.

some of the dumbest shit I have ever read. Seeing as this is front page bitcoin material, I'm honestly inclined to believe this is a pump to try to goad bitcoiners into buying large sums of BTC, like most posts you see on the frontpage. 
Why DCA does work: Because if the stock you're buying is worth buying now, it will still be worth buying next month, and next year. Only the foolish feel the need to 'lock it all in at once'

wow, what a fucking cock you are. I didn't know I was getting into a resume dick waving contest with some blowjob who nobody has fucking heard of outside of a paragraph the guy probably typed himself. Guess what dipshit, academia is classic for attempting to debunk classicly profitable investment strategies and norms. I stress again, just cause this blowjob thinks its an idea worth putting into a powerpoint presentation doesn't mean its an idea worth following.

just because its in a powerpoint doesn't mean its right. its just somebody trying to justify an investment strategy, nothing more, nothing less.

its not a university in london, its a guy involved in a university in london. 
shit dude, lots of people go to uni in london, I don't think that's any amount of credit on its own. you're too easily impressed. 
EDIT: upon a little bit of reading i'm finding cass to not be a particularly outstanding school, and mr. simon hayley to not have a lot of credit to his name. i again stress you're too easily impressed.

this isn't something you can statistically prove. you can just cite cherry picked example that show your theory in a good light. Sorry zombiecatelyn, but you're not only the fuckhead here, you're also the one getting fucked. hard.
