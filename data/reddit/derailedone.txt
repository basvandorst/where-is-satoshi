He's both for and against encryption, just like every other issue he's expressed an opinion on.

At least he had interesting questions for Nic.  Better than the idiot and the racist he was sitting with.

Paper wallet or cold storage that have never been online are the safest, obviously :P

The way I see it is that there are two possibilities:
1.  Dorian is not Satoshi; Arthur is just venting in a stream of consciousness style.
2.  Dorian is Satoshi, and he's evil genius smart with backup plans and contingencies for every scenario; Arthur is in on it.
Either way, I've got my popcorn and this is exciting!

Ouch, procrastination really didn't help you on this one, my friend.  Took me two weeks of reading articles and watching videos for a few hours a day just to grasp the basics.  
How long do you have?  I would start with the side links located over there ------&gt;

Given this guy's proclivity for privacy, I would bet he will only accept cash USD.  Few will turn down a stack of Benjamins.

If you're using one of those mining profitability calculators, I suggest doing what I do before preordering:  plan for bad case scenarios as likely and plan for worst case scenarios as possible.  
For example, I usually inflate the difficulty by at least 5 times the current value and reduce the sale price of BTC by 1/2 current value.  If you can still make your money back in 6 months at those values, it is probably worth ordering but is still a risk.

You've got my favorite Andreas quote in there, "...replaced the FED with 100 lines of python code." Hahahaha!

Serious block of text there.  I read the first line, it looks like you could have something interesting to say, but it's barely readable in it's current form.  Try hitting "enter" on occasion.

Hahahaha!  That joke he told at the beginning was hysterical, but probably only because I never used MtGox.

Given that it is essentially an advertisement, the data is irrelevant and you should probably avoid using any images that give the appearance of data.
Like tacotacoman said, if your intention is to get people interested in bitcoin, focus on the technology and the potential.

Essentially just that Leah chick saying Dorian lied to AP and LA Times, and that she thinks he really is Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-01-26 11:25:47
This doesn't really have any effect on markets, businesses, exchanges, etc, although it may be precedent for tax inquires.  Many things are considered "money" and not everyone agrees on what is "money" and what is not.
If the law code was interpreted to mean bitcoin is legal tender, that would be something.

Redundant comments are redundant.

Why does it matter?  It's not like either are asking for donations or spreading FUD about bitcoin.  
If they are relatives of Dorian, then all they are doing is what they said they were going to do: vent about the media to a community that is sympathetic.
If they are "fake," then they get a little chuckle over our responses.  Likely we will get a laugh over them when they're uncovered by Andreas at the end of the month.
Who cares either way?  Unless you're the kind of person who thinks everything on the internet should be "fact."

Be careful if you are in the US, any amount over $300 could be considered money laundering (a felony offense).   For greater amounts consider Coinbase, assuming you have a bank account.

If you're looking for tax evasion tips for EU, I can't help you because I live in NA.  I suppose you could always BTC transfer to another exchange before you withdraw fiat.  If Hong Kong is where the bank is located, why not use a chinese exchange?

There is a big difference between verified, unconfirmed transactions and unverified transactions.  In this case, the transaction was unverified, meaning it was never received by the network and thus would not have been seen by the merchant. i.e. It never even had a chance to be confirmed because no one knew about it.
Point of the story: don't use web wallet services for anything other than to send money from yourself to yourself.

As soon as merchants offer a ~3% discount on bitcoin purchases to offset the spread when exchanges take their cut, I will make every purchase with bitcoin.
CC companies take a cut from merchant profits, but exchanges take a cut of my purchases.  I can't justify adding that much to every purchase just to "stimulate the economy."

I don't understand the point of it, because the graph has no meaning (axes unlabeled, no numbers on axis ticks, no title saying what it is).  
No indication of what kind of class this is for.  If it is for a kindergarten art class, I would say it is very advanced.  If it is for a collegiate economics class, you might want to go back to the drawing board, MS Paint, or whatever it is you used.

The 21 petahash bitcoin network disagrees with you, noob.

Exactly.  In reality, individual psychology plays a huge part in decision making.  Some people will be as frugal as possible in an attempt to stretch their future wealth as much as possible, while others will spend frivolously every time the value deflates because they consider it "free money."
No one knows what could happen in a world dominated by deflationary currency because its never been done before.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:37:14
I'm not this optimistic, though I do think we will see a 2-5x increase in price within 2 months of SecondMarket coming online as banks and financial groups diversify into BTC.

^ What he said.  Mining hardware doesn't become obsolete because hashrate is too low, they become obsolete because the hashrate to power consumption ratio is unprofitable.  
Overclocking any silicon chip increases processing power but reduces efficiency.  For example, by overclocking your CPU you might get 10% higher frequencies but this could increase power use by 25%.

You really need to research how this actually works, its not all doom and gloom.   Essentially they move large quantities of bitcoin at a time.  They make a block of assets, set a price, then keep decreasing that price until someone buys.  This means institutions can buy or sell large quantities of coin without causing huge shockwaves throughout all the markets.
