That's what we think too! It goes right to fiat (and then to work in Africa). We're willing to walk this road and find out more. We'll keep the community updated for sure.
We do think their would be some serious issues if a US NPO tried to move actual bitcoin to the field (Kenya, Uganda, etc) if that were even possible today. It would lower costs for sure, but compliance in these money transfers is pretty important. Still, a healthy debate should be had about any role crypto-currnecy might play some day.

Nope.  I am questioning whether Bitcoin supporting donors would consider funding a rig for a charity.  A gift-in-kind.  
Would be like giving us a drill rig. One gift digs holes. The other produces money... to buy drill rigs, and dig more holes.

I own a couple BTC and about 29 chickens.  Few friends understand either.  
So, let me be the first to say... welcome!  And I do wish there was a Scratch and Peck distributor nearby us in the Northeast.  Feed is the last missing link in our organic, and almost GMO-free home egg operation.  You've got a great product!

Thank You!

Hey there!  Peter from The Water Project here.
We actually receive BTC donations for BitGive's Campaign directly, so we will be the folks issuing tax receipts.  BitGive has been very generous to rally support in this way and to donate themselves!
Since we're a registered 501(c)(3) you'll get a receipt for a "gift-in-kind", just like if you had donated stocks or real property. You can use that receipt to claim a tax deduction.
Be sure to use the "Pay With Bitcoin" button on the [campaign page]( so we'll have an email to contact you.
All our financials, docs, and legitimacy information is [posted here]( near the bottom of the page and you can verify it all via 3rd party at [Guidestar.org](
As for a suggested amount... Every drop counts.  We put all donations to work to provide clean, safe water to a specific community... and we'll prove the results with a report for everyone a few months after the campaign is completed.
Hope this helps!  Thanks everyone for your support!!

Thanks to all of you who are donating!  Sure is encouraging!!  
We'll post back here about exactly how all BTC donations are used to provide safe water since you're all anonymous and we can't email you the results directly!  We track by GPS, so you'll see the specific spot on the ground.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:19:43
Yes... That's exactly the ? we're asking.  Are margins really that tight?  And inputs that high?
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:10:17
Very helpful answer! Thanks so much. Didn't have that link before. Gonna check this off the list for now.

We're actually working on a platform to allow BTC to get as close to point-of-use in the places we work as possible - ideally a phone with locally accepted mobile-money like M-Pesa, etc.  Lots to work out, but it is promising.  It would eliminate very significant fees and exchange rates costs. See more at the link in the original post.

Also listed on our donate page as "Other Ways to Give"
Thanks for your support!

Would have to be through a (likely regulated) third-party like BitPesa in Kenya for instance. We've been in discussions with them already.

Largest BTC gift at one time yes. Thanks!

I explain more in my article  posted a few years ago.  Explaining the future possible value we saw in Bitcoin, I stated...
"Unfortunately, today, as our supporter's donations make their way to our partners in Africa, these [financial] exchanges have become far more costly than the benefits organizations and individuals actually receive from these arbiters of trade. From credit card donation processing fees, to domestic banking fees, to the costly overseas transfer of funds with its concomitant dilution through currency trading arbitrage and trade commissions, and finally to the local bank fees in Kenya or Rwanda, a lot of folks take significant "cuts" along the way. Most of these fees are obscured and non-negotiable. We're told the process is difficult, cumbersome and expensive, but since we can't see it we remain unconvinced.
The bottom line is that less good gets done as a result of all this transactional overhead.
Reduced fees or favorable trading rates would be one opportunity for banks to engage philanthropically. But alas, that trend has yet to take shape.
In the meantime, the marketplace in which we operate is ripe for an alternative."
Fast forward to today and it is possible (though we have yet to do it) to move BTC all the way to Bitpesa and onto our local team's cell phone as mPesa. They use mobile money every day. Bitpesa significantly discounts its "conversion" fee (which is already very low) for non-profits.  
A gift of $10USD today (if not combined with others) would lose somewhere north of 12-15% or more in transit at a minimum under the current system.  With BTC, the final cost would be somewhere under 2% by our own calculations.
Hope this helps.

We will! We've been accepting donations and exploring other Bitcoin use cases for years now. Up next is our [Transparency Project]( - exciting stuff.

No. It counts as fraud. This is a 'Look-alike' website.
The real thewaterproject.org has a vaild EV SSL Cert.
And we don't beg. :)
