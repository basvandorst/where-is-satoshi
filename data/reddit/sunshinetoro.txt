I think tx fee is low just because trading volumes are very low these days.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:44:44
No, I don't agree. Think about it in this way. 
Without consideration for tax. Now I can sell all of my coins to get 290K of cash. If I have 290K cash, I would not invest 200K into bitcoin right now. The initial cost of my bitcoin doesn't matter. Because it's already sank cost. I need to think about how much do I have right now, no matter of how much I spent on buying them.

Thanks for the suggestions. It's just as price goes higher and higher, I am more feared about losing my current gains on the paper. 
I am not planing to sell right now. But later if it reaches some level, I will consider to realize some gains.

lol, I just started mining with them and lost my 30 dollars!

How do you feel about living there?

Why they are comparing market cap with a country’s GDP. It doesn’t make any sense. GDP is the total production per year. Market cap should be compared with something like total asset in a country.

No, I can trade all my coin to cash and cash to coin very quickly. So they are equivalent. 
My cost of buying bitcoin are sink cost, it doesn’t matter now.

Same thing happened to several people this morning. Basically I deposited LTC into gdax. It says it's in coinbase, but didn't get into gdax so I have to move it manually. But actually the coin is gone from coinbase and also not available in gdax. 
I called and emailed but no response yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:45:58
I did the same thing 2 weeks ago. It feels so good when you wake up and realized the whole vacation is covered by the gain you got while you were sleeping.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:54:13
why it still shows it has been seized for me?
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:35:39
I just refilled some money into my steam account. I will buy the coin back when the price falls lower.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:54:10
So after most Wallets are upgraded there should be more transactions in each block?
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:55:37
it just corrected to 1800 one month ago.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:15:30
Asicboost doesn't support segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:51:00
Thanks. When would withdraw been enabled? I found a few lite coin in my account. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:29:09
Will the transaction size in a block double after that?

to be honest, I think paypal has much more users and acceptance than bitcoin at this moment. So in some sense bitcoin is highly priced given current status.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:00:30
It's better than nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:47:58
What if they buy and hold?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:15:08
does payment Chanel mean you need to deposit bitcoin into multi sig address. And when you used up your deposit you need to open a new Chanel with your deposit? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:18:01
Yes, PayPal and venmo really made transferring and payment easier for a lot of users. We claim bitcoin is good for things like international money transfer, but how many people really benefits from the use of bitcoin right now? Most of us only benefits from bitcoin as an investment. I believe bitcoin has a good future. But considering its current usage, it's definitely highly priced.

why the stolen tether was sent to a bitcoin address?
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:13:01
Like sell a full coin to buy a Tesla when bitcoin reaches 100k?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:59:14
Can someone explain why tether use the same address as bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:25:11
I think we are not going to do that in the end. I will buy her something with credit card, and not necessarily a luxury bag. I just want to say, 10 is coming so fast. I thought I would at least have a year or two. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:22:11
She is more conservative. So she might prefer to ‘lock down’ some true profit, instead of keep holding for uncertain profit in the future.
I can understand that, sometimes I also thought about that. But I am just too lazy to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:18:31
I hold it for a few years. Anyway I don’t plan to sell it soon. I have the cash to buy her some gift as a celebration.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:53:37
Same thing happened to me. pat
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:25:01
there are such options. You can send bitcoin to address that is never reacherable or spendable by anyone. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:25:35
You left in 2013?
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:20:55
it's hard to know. In the most simple case, say a transaction has two inputs of 1 coin each, and two outputs also with 1 coin each. One of the output is sent to you. How do you define which coin do you receive? The first or the second, or the mix of both?
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:30:08
4 months ago it's only at 1300? I feel that was long time ago.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:29:20
Every time i told my wife the bitcoin reached a ATH,she always responded "so I want to buy something to celebrate."
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:18:24
what do you plan to do if the price crashes and you don't have enough money to pay for your study?
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:32:04
Can I start dump my 2x coin by trading with the future?
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:54:02
i think search goes up when people noticing the price is rising.
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:29:26
not really. A lot of other alter coins reached more than 1b market cap.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:30:44
"Here you can use BTC-E Company if you need to make an investment on Bitcoin." Lol
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:31:09
You can transfer the coin to your own wallet and then send to gamble site from your own wallet
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:53:14
What happened at the end of 2013? The line is missing there.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:29:42
Can someone explain what's the drawback of segwit2x vs just Segwit. Is it the risk of hard form? And what benefits does miners like Jihan get from the 2x part?
