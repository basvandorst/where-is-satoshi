NO  they don't .Hate speech is not to be protected and it's not free. . 
The USA is a young and naive country.

Germany has been very successful banning 
Hate speech across many platforms.
It is not an issue anymore . 
Even true decentralized block chain funded 
Platforms should moderate and root out violent racist xenophobic speech .
