Ha, dude BTC will likely not be worth $500k per in 2021. I'm not saying it's impossible, just highly unlikely

Why on earth would you keep 100K apprx. 12.5 BTC sitting in Coinbase? Ledger device costs $60 and is practically idiot proof to configure for offline storage.

Probably? However, I would think they are buying alt coins that are pegged to the dollar/euro.

Trezor, Paper wallet, etc..
The point is that any form of cold storage is infinitely better than storing large amounts of BTC on any exchange. The only reason for that is day trading.

Makes sense. Thanks!

If it hits $6000 I can see it pushing further

Instead of donating I would rather buy more BTC

What isn't taxed in America would be a better question. Also this is something that has been asked many times. I usually use this site when I have questions about something.

Hypothetical Question.
Let's say Bitcoin replaces fiat. How would credit work? Would it be the same as fiat. So when buying a house would you be in debt for 1.6 BTC, 1.4 BTC? Could I make a purchase with a crypto credit card and then owe BTC to a third party?

Coinbase and Robinhood are both good options for novice investors. Leaving purchased crypto currency in the exchange means that it does not truly belong to you.  I would also recommend moving the coins to cold storage offline after purchase.

Doubtful. Smart investors saw this coming and increased their position when BTC was hovering around 3k - 5k for months... This is what pushed the price to its current state.  
I suspect that anyone watching 60 minutes likely remembers BTC from the bubble of late 2017. They are either already invested or they were burned and lost money. So I don't expect a 60 minutes episode to do anything remarkable.
Still, massive institutional wealth is coming. BTC is going up in the long term.
