I think I see the point you are trying to make but it has nothing to do with economics.  
It is certainly not Economics 101 which would be principles of supply and demand.


The people empower police.  If there was no government, people would pick the biggest, baddest person and appoint them sheriff, police chief or whatever.  This has nothing to do with money.
If governments around the world were to breakdown, science has shown that people would organize themselves locally and civilzation would continue on.  It would not be anarchy all over with criminals running rampant and bands of cannibals hunting people.  That is all Hollywood fantasy.

Those are libertarian philosophies but I would argue they exist on the spectrum of anarchism not libertarianism. Some of those above would have to have some semblence of government even if it would be the institutions that would redistribute goods, money, etc.

Well considering sales tax is state based you can simply claim that on your state tax return.  We have been buying sales tax free goods on the internet for years.  I am not sure I see the difference.
If people are that worried about it, on your state return you can easily just claim the USD amount that you spent on said goods, claim it and pay the taxes when you file.

That is exactly the beginnings of government.  My point was that it would restart the entire process of formation of government.

Only when said statements cross the line to anarchy.  Libertarians still believe in government just limited government.

That conclusion is not conducive to any form of organization and would remain chaotic.

I say that because you seem to lack knowledge of how to claim capital gains.  The current state of bitcoin makes it an investment until widespread adoption would cement its position as a currency.  This would mean that you would claim any monetary gains from Bitcoin as a normal investment.  Pretty cut and dry.  You may have to submit an extra 1099 but it sure isn't rocket science.

All of these things thrive on order.  They are called organized crime for a reason.  They would not be able to operate well in a chaotic environment because they would quickly be exposed.  The whole of organized crime is working within the boundaries of a closed system or laws.  Anarchy would not smile kindly on organized crime.

And personally I agree with that sentiment hence my support of Bitcoin as well.  Thanks for the awesome quotes.  I very much enjoyed the Ludwig von Mises one

I agree but that is not in the case of the US.  There are simply too many guns in the hands of too many people.

I have to preface this with saying that these are not my personal beliefs but rather I am arguing a position for the sake of good conversation.


Ideally the government would be based on a consensus and therefore be representative of the populace so that problems could be addressed more efficiently.  Does this work in practice?  Occasionally.
I would argue that the more repressive forms of government actually govern much better in this regard.  They may be actively suppressing and subjugating a whole group of people but you can't argue with results.  My real world example would be Sadam Hussein.


I have to admit I have a hard time answering this.  I think previous eras in history government would not be the ideal solution. However in today's world limited resources and high demand due to the world's population would force government to be the ideal broker for a group of people that may need access to a resource yet are physically separated from it.  Could this happen without government?  Sure it does.  Again the idea would be to have a government that represents the people or the will of the people.

I fail to see how that differs except in semantics.  Any voluntary organization will be the precursor to government.  The accumulation of power whether willful or not is necessary for any type of organization.
Also I would question the definition of government as those that have a monopoly on violence.  The general populous has always been able to resort to violence whenever necessary.  Maybe you mean the ability to subjugate through violance.

I am going to wager that you may never have done taxes in the US.

This is the exact reason why we need more people like [Thomas Massie]( in politics.

The threat of intervention into daily affairs that operate without government.


Sectarianism.  Human nature is to be apprehensive of those that are different even if the distinction is only in ideologies.

Why do you think the US has such a fascination with zombies?  Because people would get to use their guns!
