So I'll just click on my account and press the 'create backup' on top then I copy my seed on paper? Where do I find my pin?
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:35:07
Thanks, do I need to enter my wallet's seed whenever I send money or is it the pin code? where's it located?

hoping for a 20% rise by the end of today

I see, if I use a credit card to buy say 10usd worth of Bitcoin where's the best place to do it?
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:59:24
Yeah exactly that! At the same time I’m satisfying myself by “buying” something :)
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:15:45
Okay  so I now have my master seed and pin, where do I buy bitcoins for paypal money (around 20 USD)?
@_date: 2017-04-02 05:43:03
coinbase is a wallet too right? also would I save more with card or PayPal payments?
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:07:25
Yeah, it’ll be a great story to tell future youngsters!
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:39:30
Gotcha, so it stays there, locked up forever in your dead drive.
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:11:10
There’s a lot of places online to buy it, I personally got mine on a Minecraft forum. If you’re going to buy from another person make sure they’re legitimate by checking their reputation.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:10:32
I don’t mind, I’m thinking long term - and if it doesn’t pan out so what? It’s money I would’ve spent on random stuff anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:40:35
Will do for sure, it seems really interesting!
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:07:30
Glad it’s working out well for you :), and I can totally relate to the stuff about your country.
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:06:11
I’ll take a look at it, thanks! It’s a good idea to spread out my coins right?
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:29:41
Yeah, I plan on putting in at least $100 a month.
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:31:49
Kk, I might split once I have a significant amount which would hopefully be the case by the end of 2019~
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:09:04
Well, the reason I decided to get BTC is because I didn’t have a better use for my money and this could potentially  be a good investment to rely on for when I do need money - so you’re spot on.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:11:55
I got an Apple phone :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:15:31
I might buy more since I’m still a kid and don’t really have a lot I spend money on, problem is I don’t know when to buy more.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:27:16
Thank you :) I’m using a mobile wallet called BRD - is that alright?
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:30:47
Gotcha, :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 10:21:39
erm, what?
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:08:07
Trade with USD or other cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-11-26 10:24:51
Hahaha dang, what happened to your Bitcoins though? Was it forever lost or did it like “go back in circulation”? And, is it part of the BTC total cap?
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:38:59
Yup, all I know about Bitcoin is that no one controls it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 10:21:04
I plan on keeping it for a long time, and yeah I did buy hoping it’ll rise in a few years or so.
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:13:26
it’s not always about wise financial investments, sometimes you gotta put some money for things/events you’ll enjoy
@_date: 2018-11-26 10:28:48
Yeah I’ve already checked it more than ten times just today, here’s to hoping it won’t consume me.
That’s nice, around how much btc did you manage to mine?
