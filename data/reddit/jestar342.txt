He doesn't say price.

Why? He's answering the obvious question of "does this mean bitcoin has been cracked?" and the answer, just as he gives, is "no"
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:34:24
It's pretty obvious he is trying to dispel any potential myth that the tech is broken. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:34:41
The technology that is bitcoin. The software, the algorithm etc. Bitcoin hasn't been "hacked" - an *exchange* has been hacked.

unless the joke is that southpark get it wrong accidentally on purpose or something.

That's Greenland, right? I guess it's not that hard to imagine bitcoin can be used there.

"Coinbase being a douche - lost me $400" is no doubt what the seller is thinking.

Percent. Per Cent. Per = For each. Cent = One hundred.
Therefore, 97.2% = 97.2 Per Cent = 97.2 for each 100. Short-hand: 97.2:100, or 97.2%.

Due diligence is always required for any financial service. If any business profits or serves terrorism, for example, they are liable, regardless of actual knowledge or intent.
An example is the law firms that handle the piracy ransoms for vessels captured off the coast of Somalia. If it is found that any of that money gets into terrorist hands, they are liable.

They all are. No, seriously. I'm not being facetious or particularly pro-bitcoin, but all financial institutions will do *just* enough to stay legal and no more. There are *no* morals in finance. Hell, there's no morals in any kind of business really.

BRB, selling CP without being checked first.

Trying to discredit by means other than the topic of discussion, especially without refutation of your opponents points, is a clear indicator that you are losing the argument.

"Don't use words like 'sleep', else we will withdraw our service." 
Is a far cry from being mandated not to use any given word.

CC companies aren't censoring anything. They just don't want to be affiliated with illegal activity. It's a very simple concept to understand. Likewise with PayPal and other payment gateways. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:48:59
No, it's a way of saying they only do "moral" stuff because they are obliged to. They do not go out of their way to avoid illegal financial activity, they do enough so that if the shit hit the fan, they can brush their hands and say "Well we did what was legally required of us, it's not our fault you don't expect us to be more thorough with background checks on our clients, nor confirmation where the money comes from. We'll only go as far as the law tells us too." Most of these checks are also so trivial that, if anything, the banks use it as an idiot detector. I.e. if someone fails these tests then they are probably too thick to not get caught anyway.
When the reality is they could, but refuse, to do a LOT more when checking on/vetting where the money comes from.
See also the shit that has been happening with the bailouts. The governments "buying out" huge portions of the bank - does that sound like record performance to you? So what's with the record bonuses? That'll be because in no contract does it say "You cannot use this tax payer money to fill your own pockets." So the money given to the banks by the tax payer is syphoned off, out of the bank, as quickly as possible, so the tax payer cannot ask for it back. All legal, but a damn shade of immoral.

I'm not asking anything. You're not responding to the point. The irony in your last sentence is palpable. Give some substance to your argument more than "Yeah, well, do you check your customers?" which is about 1 IQ point above "No, YOU are corrupt."
