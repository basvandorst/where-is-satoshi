This makes a lot more sense, and I wish more people could read it. I think the Korean Government knows that if it wants to regulate it in the  future and tax it, it can't overreact and force bitcoin to go into a black market. Bitcoin is internet based, and unless S Korea turns into North Korea, it will not be able to stop people from finding a way to buy/sell it. They can see who is buying bitcoin to tax it, but in actuality that's a good thing for bitcoin because it legitimizes it as an investment and ensures its not going to be immediately banned in the future.

Its not really the entirety of our media, its just the Media options that the majority of people decide to listen to. It can't be too complicated, too long of an article, or too technical, but it should still get the heart pumping. Hence = blown out of proportion information lacking the whole story. There are very good Western Media Publications, but you don't see the ignorant masses listening to them unfortunately.
