They are just two of the [Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse](
    8.3.4. "How will privacy and anonymity be attacked?"
           - the downsides just listed are often cited as a reason we
              can't have "anonymity"
           - like so many other "computer hacker" items, as a tool for
              the "Four Horsemen": drug-dealers, money-launderers,
              terrorists, and pedophiles.

I suspect it has to do with new EU regulations.

Nope, most of these were salted. These were just easy ones.

I have an idea for the creation of a microcontract/monetized version of stack overflow using bitcoins for just these types of things. Such a thing could make freelance work much more rapid. Haven't fleshed out the details of the site yet, but if someone could help me with setting up PyOpenCL, I would offer 1 BTC.
Why not make a preliminary version as a subreddit? r/bitlancer? r/cointracts?

I just was throwing the idea out there and providing an example of something I would use such a service for. Money without friction is perfect for this sort of thing.

I was thinking about buying something on bitmit, but the selection isn't good or competitive enough compared to selling my bitcoin and buying something on craigslist. The discount strategy be able to offset it.

More than just the affiliation, I wouldn't want to do business with him, or if I had to, I'd be cautious. MegaUpload got where it was by [snitching on competitors]( and even if he learned that lesson, I don't think I'd trust him.

He doesn't have any involvement with PayPal anymore. But if you want to see Peter Thiel in a tight spot, watch his response to being asked directly about bitcoin:

Can someone spell "selection bias"? The title should read "96% of of viewers of a youtube channel that responded to a survey are male". I haven't noticed any descrepancy between the sexes in the response of those I explain bitcoin to.
