Hmm. What about end retailers who might be accepting btc for regular goods and services?

We will make blockchain free next gen aws and mla powered, coins for our IOT infrastructure of the future running on aws cloud and connecting all machines and bezos's vision and imagine this written with bad CSS this is an awesome ico. In place of using electiricity to provide proof of work in this coin we will use the same computing power which powers amazon's large retail business and the aws. Next future is this coin.

Then why doesn't the other side act with integrity, go with a different name, and prove that the alt will not be more centralized? An easy way to prove this would be to show that in 6 months, node distribution is similar to bitcoin? 
It's a tactical attack at bitcoin, and an attempt to make money in an unregulated market, by confusing new users - nothing more. Just know that once you're a forker, you lose all credibility in the community, and reduce to nothing more than a conman.

I don't know which alt you're into, but you are surely buying a whole lot of tin.

All ad-hominems.


It is, if the entire purpose is to replicate the functionality of another coin that already exists - it is called Litecoin. Why not wait out and see how Litecoin is able to address node concentration - and then upgrade when there is a consensus?


I never said I do. However, conmen rarely build a community.

Specifics? It does solve the problem you are saying you can fix. What part of the algorithm makes this fork necessary?
