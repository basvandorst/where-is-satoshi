Here is why,
About half a billion$ of NEM stolen, the Exchange also does BTC and some other alts.
They disabled withdrawal of all crypto and fiat, causing panic across Japan, then the west decided to follow.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:42:43
It's not about nem it's about not being able to get BTC or fiat out of the exchange. I don't own any shitcoin and they still hold my fiat hostage.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:01:11
Mysteriously BTC trading is unaffected, but withdrawal are disabled.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:02:37
Yeah maybe but to me is well I can't afford a BTC but I can buy 10mbtc, I feel this is a lot more positive
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:38:24
No it's paper trading, a bet basically, of they also own BTC they can sell the BTC to manipulate the price .
It's just rich people betting where the price of BTC will be in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:05:22
because the resource of the blockchain is storage, big transations(datawise) has to pay more by design. there is a lot of education to be done for the new users.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:27:19
My wallet is looking forward to that
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:49:23
This is more exposure, but it's cash settled therefore it should have a negligible impact on the price. In the long run it will increase market confidence and decrease volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:54:47
What about 19$ a share to 1k a share :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:58:13
Yes everything is settle in Fiat, a big whale
Could short and dump 15k BTC no problem and make money both ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:41:30
Yes no Bitcoin will change hand then they use an index to determine the price, usually futures market can't go too far from the index price unless they are on the winning side
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:48:50
Hmm more exposure is good but I feel it's going to be short term bearish
@_date: 2015-12-25 02:49:52

@_date: 2017-02-13 02:51:13
it's up to you. Bitcoin is still in a speculation phase, some speculation say that 1 btc will worth 40k, some say 1 million.
If its a gift I'd say keep it safe somewhere in an offline wallet.

The bank of China announced a meeting with the exchanges. Something like that
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:09:57
I think the main argument from BU against it it's that since it's a soft fork it will take a lot of time for people to upgrade. BU peoples say years but I doubt it.
While BU provides an immediate block size increase, it needs a very big consensus before hard forking without consequences, which itself might take longer than people switching to segwit

We wouldn't need a maliability fix if there was no other problem than the block size.
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:26:56
Segwit is not meant to be a block size increase, it's a bonus.

H haha yeah I know what you mean I started recently and I was trading with emotion and I lost a few bucks to fees mostly.  I'm quite good with long selling but my short selling skills are quite terrible
@_date: 2017-02-04 07:48:59
well not in term of skills but I mean, I usually keep my cool and buy at a good time. and sells at peaks, but for some reason with short selling I always loose a few bucks or make like 1 or 2 $

The answer is offchain scaling and/or bBigger blocks which segwit would bring in addition to the malleability attack fix.
Edit: Segwit enable offchain scaling solution like the Lightning network
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:17:55
There is nothing wrong being against segwit, but don't threaten the network by supporting BU only to prove your point.

If you pay the recommended fee, usually your transaction should be processed quick.
If you don't pay a fee or your fee it too low, it might takes hours/days.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:10:11
Because they want to take over the development with emotional arguments and lies. Then they expect core to fix their code.
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:58:19
IMO I feel like it's not going high enough, probably due to the etf, people are waiting until the 11.

@_date: 2017-03-07 12:58:08

Therefore the increase is not 100% effective as soon as segwit is activated.

Storing the block chain has a cost. The higher the size the fastest the cost increases.

@_date: 2017-08-18 07:29:04
yes, this is what I also think,
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:54:07
You need to questions the reason, are they buying it because it's a decentralized store of value or because they want to make money? 
Bch breaks the economic code, EDA allows to mine blocks so fast that the inflation rate is much higher. It's a Trojan horse coin only meant to attack Bitcoin. If they had kept the original economic code it would be a much better coin.

Well on one hand, Luke suggest a block size reduction, so judging by your sarcasm would you rather get that?
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:08:20
Hmm could it be a network problem? 
At the transaction confirmation there is the "Vue par 1 pair"
maybe noone outside of your node saw the transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:14:46
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:35:38
You need to also understand that decentralization comes at a cost. While I don't like the high fees I am sure it's only temporary until Bitcoin is mature enough and significant improvements had been made to the network.
Also simulating the scarcity of gold make Bitcoin digital gold not fiat. Fiat is printable by centralized entities. You give USD to PayPal they give you the équivalent in a fiat replacent digital cash, it's fast, quite secure but not really censorship resistant and simply digital fiat.

how will 300k reduce bloat? it just make it easier to attack bitcoin with spam attacks, when we have a solution to transact properly, attackers will lose any reason to attack the network through spam.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:00:11
How is it working fine?, miners are only exploiting it to make more money to sell to the people dumb enough to buy it. The chain is down every two days after the difficulty adjustment happens.

Crypto profit is taxed up to 55% :( depending your yearly revenue
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:31:17
 it trim the content of the transaction by moving the signature to the witness data. Signature is about half the size of the transaction so you get about 2x, however there is a way to have a 4mb block but those will be very rare.
Instead of carrying 500k of transaction, segwit allows 1mb but the total block size will be about 2mb.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:43:15
Having smaller blocks is a valid point of view but I would not support it until we have the infrastructure to reduce the stress on the blockchain.
If lightning is so successful and everything maybe 300k blocks is a good size. We don't have any number to prove it, so let it to the default 4mb of segwit for now, then reevaluate in a few months.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:42:59
You can get fees yes.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:05:27

Same experience with the downvoting brigade.
might be sensored but I really doubt it's censored as much as they claim.
They always say that criticizing segwit gets you censored, I really doubt that's the case. Sure having you creating a post saying segwit is shit will get you censored. But that is not criticism.

@_date: 2017-11-08 23:13:14
The exchange lends you a higher amount that you can afford, in return you make more profit/loss but you need to keep a security margin (protects you to go below 0) on 5x, if the price drop 20% you lose everything.
There is other way to not get liquidated but let's say it's the normal case of you go all in.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:14:58

My guess is that a lot of people don't have Segwit addresses yet, moving you coins and updating all your cold storage is not that easy.

No you can buy 1$ of 2xcoin from an exchange supporting 2x, send these to you wallet then send everything to dump on an exchange

Really happy to hear that.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:42:52
if you buy s2x coins from an exchange to your 2x  wallet and spend the txo, the transaction will be invalid on the main chain. 
It should be enough to separate your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:29:52
Probably a problem with your wallet at that point, try viewing the address directly on a website to see in the coins are there, try importing your keys in a different wallet.

The problem had never been the block size but

@_date: 2017-11-14 03:36:57
where are the transactions coming from?
personally I dont know but by the look of it they have a very low fee, therefore very likely spam and transaction from hot/cold wallets.

If you do some TA, 900 again is very unlikely.
When we get to the next high of USD2000, USD1200-1400 is probably the lowest we gonna fall.
Ofcourse that does not take fork bullshit in consideration, simply looking at the graph

They are mostly legit, but I would not recommend them due to political reasons.
@_date: 2017-04-29 03:18:16
They can't simply fork because they follow the chain that had the most work. Unless they modify the code to reject blocks that do not signal EC

It's a legitimate concern for people who do not understand it. The value backing Bitcoin is hard to grasp.
I was a non believer until I read more about it, thought it was a waste of electricity, drug money, etc.

The entry cost of mining is far too high. If we could still mine with CPUs  I would agree with that statement. 
Right now every time someone asks about mining he gets laugh at and told he will lose money. 
It's easy to see that that how the mining business turned is not the best for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-07 22:58:38
No because your transaction need to be included in a block, there is a block every 10 minutes average, if the network is overloaded you might have to wait the next block.
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:25:30
I read core was compatible but it might only be a code fork and not merged.

The old nodes ignore the segwit part. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:21:15
Decentralization, 
keep nodes run cost low, 
keep propagation time lower to not give advantage to some miners by having a big head start on the next block.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:04:34
Yeah we need a good balance between
Fees, Centralization, Mempool, Confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:07:32
the fees, but if it needs to be converted in fiats hes at the mercy of the market tho.
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:44:04
I have actually no idea on the viability or if it would cause centralization, but Im just throwing that out of thin air.
I would like some kind of Elastic blocks
Lets say, 90% of the last 1024 block are 95% full, the size would increase by 10% on the next period. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 05:40:54

Starting another project is good, it might not get traction but no one is prevented from doing so.
Bitcoin is also as immutable as the blockchain itself. Which in a sense is a positive thing, but with the current scaling debate people seems to see that as a *Lack of innovation*

@_date: 2017-09-26 01:41:58
I somewhat agree, because this is what I do myself (not coinbase but a japanese exchange) but they can decide tomorrow to close your account because you sent coins to an address they dont like.
And no they are not grating coins all the time, there is a lot of bitcoin forks, BCH is the first fork they will grant you coins on.

@_date: 2017-09-26 00:22:24
It depends, 
1. do you trust more Coinbase than yourself with security? 
2. You are at their mercy in case of forks, they can decide to grant or not grant coins on a fork chain, they can decide to follow a chain that you do not agree with the rules. Having your coins on a hardware wallet is the best option for those who do not actively trade and are willing to modify their behavior for more security.

@_date: 2017-09-03 04:17:03
might be inconvenient but if you put your coins in a vault you can have access to your keys and use a wallet that allows custom keys.

Venezuela's cash becomes a little more worthless every day.
It's a problem at the core of people's lives in Venezuela. Inflation forces them to cough up more and more bills for staples like food and medicine, which are in short supply for many, creating a humanitarian crisis.
On Friday, $1 equaled 10,389 bolivars. Earlier this week, on Monday, it was worth 8,820 bolivars. At the start of this year, $1 equaled 3,164 bolivars, according to the unofficial exchange rate calculated by dolartoday.com, which millions of Venezuelans use.
What's worse: Private banks let Venezuelans take out only 30,000 bolivars ($2.88) from an ATM at at time. Government-run banks: 10,000 bolivars (96 cents).
The currency's plunge over the years is jaw dropping.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:43:23
Exchanges at centralized, and they are a few threatening to rename the 2x chain as BTC.

Simple, right now the price control Bitcoin, it's not easy to see right now because for now the price as always followed the chain with the most cumulative difficulty, however I think that this time (2x) it will be the first time that the price will not follow the majority of the hash rate.

No no and no, most people are against it because it's rushed and was planned regardless of Segwit effect on the congestion. Many developers are not against well planned HF. Bitcoin is the future for store of value, no see to rush development because someone wants to buy coffee.

Yes x5 leverage, but the thing is the price moved by about 300$ usd dollars in less than 1h then crash back down. 
The price is very still a lot higher that USD tho.
I'm not rich but catching this volatility is really fun. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:37:53

Bitcoin right now = Riding a bus and bringing your luggage with you.
Segwit = You now but the luggage in a luggage compartment instead on bringing them on the bus with you.
The reason why there is more place is that they only keep the essential data (from, to, amount) and they put the signature in the witness data. The non transaction part makes about 50% of the space of a transaction. So by using Segwit we have an efficiency gain of the transaction data.
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:55:58
95 is safest because it's very unlikely that the majority of hash power would "undo" segwit and steal funds and create a longer Proof of Work chain.

There is no agreement

Yes, that's why we need a scaling solution. Lightning would enable instant bitcoin transactions.
Lightning works but is not deployed on main net because we need Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-03 06:27:58
the current limit is 1mb not 10mb

Even if Bitcoin Unlimited would be accepted, it only allow nodes to change the block limit, miners could still mine 1mb blocks if they want.
Segwit is a real scaling solution that allow people to scale outside the main chain when censorship resistance and security is not needed.
BU turns bitcoin in a political coin.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:28:08
Bitcoin unlimited is shit and you are at the mercy of the miners. Even with unlimited miners can still mine 1mb as a big fuck you too people like you.

Haha, I had almost no btc but at least my stop loss triggered ;)
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:38:32
There is no single proof that any miner on the other side supports what they are signaling for.
Like politics people votes for what has the most chance to block the side they don't like.
Then you end up with the Scotland/Quebec problem when a minority does not feel well represented and threaten to leave because whether they are right or wrong do not feel represented.

Nah, Satoshi said blocks should be as small as **required**, 
now we need to define **required**, but it would be nice to have Segwit and a second layer beforehand.

Most coins are only tradeable against BTC anyway so, the money have to return to BTC at some point, probably when the bubble pop.

Hopefully it won't be needed and segwit will be activated at a much lower threshold.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:36:03
That will never work, miners should just signal segwit we will then see if a block increase is needed.

Yes I agree, chargebacks are a fake protection against bad actors. The only time you should be a chargebacks is against fraud. 
With Bitcoin you lose that ability but retailers gain protection from bad actors. The buyer side now needs to do his homeworks better, which is good. 
Legit businesses should never be the target of a chargeback anyways.

Ok yes I see what you mean lol, hopefully once segwit active, lightning will prove that bigger blocks are unneeded before the hard fork. I don't want China coin.
On the fork thing, I know it's the opposite but if it's 80% against 20% the side losing is responsible for not following.

3000 was really short then we dropped. Maybe you was just unlucky when looking at the price.

I prefer the Decred hybrid system to full PoS if we would have to adopt PoS.

I only heard good praise about them, they had a costly ETH contact bug recently but they lost money and didn't affect the users.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:07:53
They are compatible unless a non segwit block is mined after uasf, as soon as a non segwit block is mined it will follow the longest therefor split the chain.

A Cryptographically secure scarce asset, just by owning it you kind of use it.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:27:39
thanks, now I know about them ;)
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:22:36
Until the hardfork happens only core side gets what they want, during the period between segwit and the hardfork, they will be able to disarm the bomb by proving that we do not need bigger blocks yet.

Spam protection is the fee but looks like some people have to much money.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:50:56
In the best case scenario, lightning has an overwhelming success and bigger blocks become unneeded. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:35:10
Hmm, I heard there is a shortage of hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:25:22
yeah not sure why peoples say that, I trade on JP exchanges and never paid any taxes to buy BTC
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:13:50
Well you can make money with a channel so there is an incentive unlike running a non mining node.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:18:36
No each are 1$ in value, also leverage. But when you see these huge numbers they are often 100x 
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:53:43
Bitfinex is another I think.
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:49:53
Sorry but bip141 is over 45% and is more popular than EC for over a week
@_date: 2017-06-21 10:28:09
Maybe for segwit, then more fud will come before the hard fork
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:35:56
Test showed an average of 1.7 or something even tho the max is 4mb if all planets are aligned.
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:56:07
It's not
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:02:15
In fact I bought some yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:27:57
well segwit is not activated, its ready to tho.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:32:28
Simply because we don't know how often Chanel will be created and settled. We could need a block size increase, I do not think it's out of question.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:38:27
Don't invest in what you don't understand.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:43:15
It's pretty much like opening a lightning channel however unlike lightning they can get hacked and lose all your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:47:08
It's a free market and Bitcoin worths what people are willing to pay for it.
It's a limited resource so the price is drived by supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:11:54
Just go on a faucet, your will get it for free. Mostly undependable tho
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:57:24
Ok, but let's say I was looking to buy btc just like you.
I never heard of them and reviews are polarized. I would not consider them.
But that's me.
I have absolutely​ no knowledge about them but it doesn't mean it's not popular so I understand your point.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:39:41
No it just prove that btc is King and that
The fud about btc losing is place is in fact fud.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:00:22
thanks for the update
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:07:21
That would crash the price of it was all they were doing.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:09:12
Hmm I feel it would increase the orphan rate. Which is quite undesirable.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:46:26
It depends. Until the hard fork, core will be compatible. I'm not sure how the hard fork will come but. Core will have to decide to implement it or split the chain by rejecting the bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:57:40
Usually it's a previous high, 2430 on bitstamp is a good example.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:05:01
I didn't know segwit2x would reject blocks. I thought it would simply activate segwit at 80% instead. Thank you for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:39:33
80% of miners or so agreed to it, however the code they would need to use is not production ready yet.
Segwit will activate before the hardfork. So there will be a time when it's gonna be segwit and second layer solutions time to shine.
Hopefully everyone will be happy with the fees and a bigger block size will be unneeded.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:45:49
Apparently it's part of the fee but it's nowhere near 8%
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:35:30
30% of the post are about peer to peer electronic cash
30% anti blockstream
10% anti 30% how great are altcoins compared to btc
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:00:23
3000 is the new 3$ and 30$, 30k next
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:42:17
never heard of them
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:31:07
Ok yes you might be right.
Larger blocks would very likely increase the rate.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:40:25
You could get an Avalon, less efficient but it don't give money to Bitmain.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:21:27
Too much waffles

No interest in ICO, they are the new Kickstarter 
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:33:15
there is no tax on buying bitcoins in japan. (at least on exchanges, not sure about atms)
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:55:30
I agree but when segwit activate it's up to the lightning guys to prove it. They will have open field.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:30:57
That's the only use case I can think of
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:16:00
Well what I meant​ is if people decide to stay with core at all cost, either core implement segwit2x or the node will create a new chain by rejecting the first 2mb block.
But yeah it was before I learn that you need to signal for segwit2x or your blocks will be rejected.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:11:04
Thats me because, I can't even purchase a damn bitcoin because buying bitcoins in Canada sux.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:14:32
Haha thank you guys any fraction of bitcoin help.
Your generosity is awsome ;)
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:07:50
Haha thanks, working on those bitcoins ;)
Multibit is nice, its one of the recommended on bitcoin.org
