ya.  like he said.  make ur paper wallet..make sure its all legible...make another copy of the public key only...put the paper wallet (the original with public and private keys) somewhere safe...use the copy of the public key to purchase bitcoin with...use a blockchain explorer or bitcoin account balance checker on your phone to confirm that you have received the bitcoin
i cut the public address copy down to the size of a bank card and had it laminated...i bought from a bitcoin atm...i held the laminated card in front of the atms scanner

it may be possible to change mining so that an additional useful product (bitcoin it self is a useful product) is created
what? idk...maybe some sort of calculations that benefit science?
i think some coins already exist that do this but i have not taken a closer look
what i like about bitcoin is that it is just raw money...it is not trying to be anything else

1) bch value rises for some unknown reason
2) it is more profitable to mine and then sell the mined coins on the bch blockchain
3) hash power chases the money thus removing their influence from the bitcoin blockchain
4) more decision power now resides with the hash power remaining on the bitcoin blockchain
5) the hash power remaining on the bitcoin blockchain is now comprised to a greater degree with those who wish to decide the future of bitcoin

"How Signaling Works
In order for Bitcoin miners to make their choice between upgrading to Bitcoin Unlimited, Segwit, or any other version of Bitcoin, they must edit their mining software to make a small mark on the blocks that they mine. This small flag is called a ‘versionbit’ and its only purpose is to reveal to the world their choice of software client. **Only Bitcoin miners can make these ‘votes’ and only when they have successfully mined a block.**
When enough blocks are mined and signaled with the same versionbit, the new client software can be safely upgraded by those miners with little fear of the network splitting into two different Bitcoins. However, if the miners attempt to upgrade to a new, incompatible version of Bitcoin before enough miners are signaling the same version, Bitcoin could split into two or more different Bitcoins, like Ethereum’s blockchain split last summer. Such a move could destroy investor confidence in Bitcoin, a fate that most people want to avoid."

ill just share my personal experience with you cause im bored and it may help u in some tiny way...if nothing else file it with all the other random stuff
ive never had a transaction not go through...i used mycellium and always used max fee button cause i was selling $2000 at a time and i just wanted it done...and so did the buyer...at the time a couple months ago i was paying about $10 for the privilege of next block confirmations...i have no idea what you are paying now
once i used the "normal fee" button and after a couple hours got tired of waiting so used the fee boost service on the mycellium wallet...it went through about 30 minutes after that
i would never use btc to transfer small amounts...i would not have sold in $2000 chunks but that was my daily exchange withdraw limit...would have rather sold all at once for a single $10 fee
so if i was a user of bitcoin i would be waiting to see which will provide the better user experience...lightning network or bitcoin cash
thats why i have kept both btc and the bch ... cause i have no idea what will happen and if i dont know what i am doing then i do nothing (i do nothing about 99% of the time haha)
i do not see a reason why btc and bch cannot both continue to exist
sorry i went off the topic !

well...you could have gambled the money in vegas...this way you still have something that could also still make you some money in time
hey you could have spent on drugs and sex! whatever turns your crank
all the money i pissed down the drain at the bar...if i dont cry over that i sure as hell dont cry over buying a bitcoin
if that was the money that was  going to pay for your kids doctor visit then shame!  if you would have wasted it anyways then good investment

some dude has just been sitting in his room doing bitcoin faucets 14 hours per day since the beginning...its all he does...all he wants to do...all he can do...i dont know what his situation is...i just hope he is happy

i wondered why they didnt go their separate way yet
most still prob have an equal amount btc/bch
i am guessing that they care about the idea of bitcoin a great deal...these people are hardcore bitcoiners
two closer allies than btc people and bch people havent existed ... is that irony idk
whatever happens dont stay mad and welcome each other back ... lol my fantasy world

ok ya a titanic and btc is the liferaft nice

ill go for it ... the network doesnt know u made a public address and private key off line... an address isnt created by the network till u send bitcoin to it
the private key is the part that stays offline so long as you never enter the private key onto any of your devices that are online
something about huge numbers and you having the same odds of winning the powerball twice in a row as creating the same bitcoin address as someone else
