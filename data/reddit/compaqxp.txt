Well I guess we'll just have to see. Not matter which way it goes it'll be interesting to see what happens.
I don't plan to buy any bitcoin now or in the future, but I'll continue to watch it.

They don't have to be part of your life experience. I've chosen not to include them in mine because I have better things to do and I frankly see getting high and such as a gigantic waste of ones time and in most cases money.
I'm not going to argue about "old farts that want to play your daddy" because like it or not some drugs are worse than others. Also, because the alcohol/smoking card is always played I don't do those things either.

Why do you think this? Everything I've seen points to Harper/the CPC remaining in power.


The Liberals are still not attractive and the NDPs new leader is less than inspiring (when compared with Jack Layton).
I fully expect the Liberals to gain back some votes for sure, but it'll likely continue to keep the vote on the left split.
I'm not a diehard CPC supporter by any means, but unless something changes seriously with the Liberals come next election I'll be voting conservative.

Obviously it's not "the face of bitcoin as a whole", but it does run ads on Reddit in order to draw people in who otherwise wouldn't know about it/the sub so does have some part in representing bitcoin.
If the first thing someone sees is drugs that would turn a lot of people off.

Have never done drugs and never will, but that's besides the point.
Having drug related posts at the top of a sub for something people want to be taken seriously probably isn't the best idea.

Though the desperate would like to believe otherwise, it can't go up like that forever.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:59:21
Because it looks so good to have drug related posts on the front page of a sub for a thing that many people think that's its only use. Yes.

I'll agree it'll hit 1k and possibly even reach 10k (I doubt), but 100K+? lol.

I obviously don't expect bitcoin to take off to the degree you think it will by then. I expect bigger numbers, but not that big.

I don't disagree with having a mix necessarily, it's mostly the content of this one and ones like it that I think could do a disservice to bitcoin. 
Some of the top posts for example in this sub I find very amusing so I'm not against people having some fun.
However some people seem to think that bitcoin is "the future" and is going to become a major currency so I'd tend to think a sub about bitcoin would be a bit more serious than most. I guess one could claim this sub is a catchall and for seriousness you go somewhere like however.

I'd rather we cure cancer then mine bitcoin/do anything with crypto, but that's just my option.

Because I don't see the NDP or Liberals as viable options on the federal level right now. It's the same reason I voted Liberal in the recent provincial election.
I don't approve of everything the current government is doing, but I also don't hate everything either. Unless the Liberals step up their game before the next election I see the best option being the conservatives.
