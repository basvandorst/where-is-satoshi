the thing is seems like nothing is in it. every time i open qt it just creates a new wallet.dat file. (i drop a backup into the bitcoin directory as others have directed, and when i start up qt again a new wallet.dat file appears ALONG WITH the backup i put in there.) i hear i have to do rescan with the backup in there but everytime i open the terminal, qt just starts up and i cant paste in the code to do rescan. im at my wits end.

yup. the funny thing is nowhere have i read that. such a simple fix and nowhere. maybe it goes without saying :) but im sure not the only one. also in the first place the upgrade to new qt shouldve recognized old wallet.dat anyway i think instead of giving me a near heartattack.

think i got it!!! sounds so stupid but backup wallet.dat file i had was named btc09122014.dat.
that is no good!
must just be wallet.dat.
i renamed it wallet.dat.....and coins appear (where as before when it was named different, qt would just create a new wallet.dat which had zero balance).
laborious syncing now but pending balance has my coin and that is a sight for sore eyes. i learned a lot in the past 48 hours. i finally understand the chainstate and what the wallet actually is. thanks for everyone's help. maybe this will help others.

so when new client is done syncing i should drop old wallet.dat file into directory and rescan? (assuming of course the coins dont show up magically when the sync is complete)

it finally synced and no coins balance 0.00. every time i open qt and drop a backup into directory (as has been suggested all over the internet) qt just creates another wallet.dat file and seems to ignore the backup. i am really running on empty here.....

i just dont know where to 'export keys' from. could you give me a little more step by step. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:13:40
how do i export private keys from the wallet.dat file? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:34:23
this is on my old mac where i downloaded the new version of qt. in the past when it was syncing it would still show my pending balance. now it shows nothing.
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:30:36
ok i have that. now what
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:27:04
when i load the old wallet.dat the bitcoin qt just creates a new wallet.dat file and it shows pending balance as 0.00 again. how do i stop it from creating a new wallet.dat and instead just read the one that i put in there?
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:43:49
ok do i just dump the old wallet.dat file in the recycle bin? also the old wallet, do you mean get it form the backup i have in the external HD or is it somewhere on my computer?
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:04:03
maybe but in the past when it wasnt synced it still said i had a pending balance
