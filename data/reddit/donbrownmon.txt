Well they couldn't come to an agreement with the other bitcoin devs, could they?  Nobody at the time would give them a number that was acceptable to them.  So no BIP.
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:52:35


Yes it has.  Bitcoin went over $1000, became very popular and world-famous, and the number of users increased.  It could increase again were it not for this limit.


Well if there are good reasons then sure.
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:44:14
Well, it was meant to be a currency.  That's why it's called bitcoin and not bit-gold or whatever.

When you say someone "agreed to" something, you're implying that that person committed to it.  That's not what happened.
What happened was more like, Gavin said 8 MB was do-able.
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:08:31
Nah, we'll just all move to an altcoin :)
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:00:46
1. How come you're not on Reddit answering questions about this?
2. Were the people involved in this decision, technically-literate (about bitcoin) people?
3. Are you *sure* that everyone understood that the debate is about the **maximum** block size?  Because it kind of sounded in the second half of your post that you'd forgotten about that.
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:38:48
They should come up with an alternative proposal then, eh?
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:51:20
According to the bitcoin wiki, you're supposed to discuss *before* making a BIP, so that you know what to put in the BIP.  But as the other devs wouldn't productively engage with Gavin about increasing the block size, there wasn't really a place to start from beyond his own 20MB plan, which would just have gotten rejected.
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:23:21

Bitcoin does not need major changes that sacrifice decentralisation, only time.  But if sidechains or whatever become ready in the meantime, great.
Besides, I want to use my bitcoin to buy coffee today and over the next few years, without paying more than half a penny in fees.  Should be do-able, depending on adoption.


Hmm... the proof of work needed to generate a block?

That's why, is it?
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:42:31
The 32MB implicit limit can be programmed around eventually.  It's just a matter of practicality, development time and resources, and safety for now.  No reason it can't be passed eventually.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:38:37
Maybe shove off to an altcoin then?  Satoshi intended bitcoin to be used for everyday transactions and there's no reason to abandon that goal.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:42:10
He wasn't asking about 'today'.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:36:54
I dunno, I think that when a protocol, hardware or software, is usually developed, there are people from industry and academia on the panel, but not a huge bunch of people all from one company.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:35:53
No, it's very important.  Who should be making these decisions about bitcoin?  If bitcoin has a ruling body, why should so many people on the governing body be from one company, a company that has conflicting interests?
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:09:12
Yeah, he was probably willing to make a BIP, but was looking for informal consensus on a new blocksize, rate of increase of blocksize, date to begin at etc.
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:31:03
Well if it's only useful for international wire transfers, then you need to consider the costs to convert back into fiat, because you can't realistically use the bitcoin for anything else.

@_date: 2015-06-20 16:35:41


Those devs have conflicts of interest.
Bitcoin was intended for everyday transactions by satoshi and most people don't want that to change.  There's not good reason to change the direction of the project.  The people who want it to change are a minority with conflicts of interest and shouldn't have too much over bitcoin.  If they are not happy with a currency intended for everyday transactions by a large number of diverse people then they should shove off to an altcoin!
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:46:47
Unfortunately it seems the other core devs with Blockstream have ideas they want to impose that aren't mature and aren't in bitcoin's best interest, so they can make money from related consulting work.

He is actually lowering the limit from bitcoin's original 32MB limit.
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:27:40
Well, you might be right.  Please assume a big "Perhaps" in front of my post.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:43:19
1. It's only a limit.
2. The code has to be simple.  This is consensus-critical code.

Luke-Jr. thinks the block limit should be smaller, though he doesn't necessarily think it's worth a hardfork to lower the limit.
His reason: Too much spam.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:57:01
No dice.  I want my coffee on the blockchain as per Satoshi's writings.  I don't want to deal with an intermediary I have to trust.
I may relax my preferences if mature low-cost alternatives that do not require a trusted or monopolistic intermediary come to exist.

@_date: 2015-06-20 14:57:39
Also, remember, it's the block size LIMIT that's being raised.  Ideally we would never get anywhere close to the limit.
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:54:22
We need more than 2MB *now*, in case of a sudden uptick in bitcoin interest.  Should start higher than that.
I personally:
- Make so few bitcoin transactions that I could conceivably make twice as many.  (One reason I don't make many is because price is too low for me to want to use them.)
- Know a person other who doesn't use bitcoin, who could.

Ever heard of Litecoin?
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:22:13


Cool.  So we want more people using bitcoin, I guess.


It's designed for that kind of thing, actually.  It's supposed to be like electronic cash.  Hence why it's called 'bitcoin' and not 'bit-gold' or whatever.
Who will judge whether my coffee is useful or not?  I guess the fees will judge, but bitcoin's supposed to be for anyone to use, not just large companies or for big transactions.


The ability to be able to transfer value to anyone with a bitcoin address?  Miners are competing to process my transaction; they can't stop me buying things they don't approve of.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:37:47
You really need to read more about Satoshi's original plans for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:20:25
I'm not aware of parts of his vision we need to sacrifice.  Bitcoin can scale, on the blockchain (though side-channels *may* eventually exist that could help it), and is intended to be used for everyday purchases like snacks and coffee.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:32:43


Because people who want to transfer value will move to a faster and cheaper substitute when their Bitcoin transfers get rejected.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:18:16
The other devs 'can't agree' because they're not interested in coming to agreement. They want to push Blockstream's technologies and make money consulting on those.

The policy has to be decided now so that people can download the software.  That's why Gavin's BIP takes effect 6 months from now, so that many people will have downloaded the software.

Well, what was blockstream working on before sidechains?

@_date: 2015-06-18 22:38:37
Sounds like stalling to me.  No reason not to increase the maximum to some more sensible amount sooner rather than later.
I see you're with Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:42:47
Well that's why we need to increase the block size -- so that bitcoin can be used for everyday purchases like snacks from vending machines, as Satoshi intended.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:32:00
If you start at the time the temporary 1MB limit was introduced, it's less than a doubling every two years.  And if you start from bitcoin's original 32MB limit, it's even less of a change.
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:17:01
It was 8MB that Gavin said was OK, in response to the representative of the Chinese mining consortium on the mailing list.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:41:13
If we're not changing the fundamental intent of the coin, we should fork to increase the blocksize limit, as it was only ever intended as a temporary anti-spam measure.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:43:33
Yep.  Look at what the BlockStream guy is saying now about his extension chain solution:

Yes it is.  The 1MB cap was a temporary anti-spam limit.  Now that there is a minimum fee and now that we have actual usage of bitcoin, with more possibly on the way, it's past time to remove it.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:51:31


Bitcoin is supposed to have low fees, so you can do everyday transactions in it like buying coffee without a monopolistic intermediary.  That was satoshi's vision and there's no reason it's not still valid.  Miners compete to process your transaction and that competition should keep fees low.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:04:08
They have a 2.5 minute blocktime.

I guess we're talking about savings?  And some people might not have a foreign bank account.  And they might want to hide their savings for a while or take them to another country, so Euros in cash might not be the best.
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:48:50
Bitcoin was capable of handling 8MB blocks then and it's capable now.  The difference is, so few people were using bitcoin back then that there was no reason to allow 8MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:24:47
Why not both?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:22:39
As for the 1MB limit, it was only ever intended to be temporary (and so was snuck into the code without peer review) and was introduced before bitcoin became popular or well-known.
It really should have been set to be removed well before now.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:27:25
I want to use bitcoin to buy my morning coffee if I can.  People won't do that if the fees are too high.
It's evident from satoshi's writings that he did intend bitcoin to scale and to be able to be used for everyday transactions like coffee and snacks.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:38:48
To keep the code simple.  This is consensus-critical code and if anything went wrong in it, it would be a disaster.

Yeah, look at Betamax.  It couldn't record a whole movie!  But things worked out OK in the end.
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:34:13
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:49:51
I think that Satoshi intended for blocks to eventually be in the tens of gigabytes, and did use examples of using bitcoin for buying coffee and buying snacks from vending machines.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:34:40
The 1MB blocksize limit was snuck into the code without peer review and only ever intended to be temporary.  The person who snuck it in (Satoshi) suggested forking to fix it later.
It is intended that everyday transactions are able to take place on the blockchain.  Source: The kinds of things that Satoshi said.
It's not intended that most people run full nodes.  SPV was considered an important part of bitcoin from the start and is defined in Satoshi's original whitepaper.
Keeping the 1MB limit is a 'change', whereas making the limit higher is less of a change.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:51:15


No!  Why on earth do I keep reading this kind of thing?
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:46:30
This is about the block size **limit** — The maximum size that a block could be allowed to be, even if everyone in the world wanted to make important transactions all at the same time.

How do you mean?
Bitcoin's blocktime is pretty bad already -- sometimes it takes an hour to get a block -- without having to also worry about transactions not being included in several consecutive blocks, being dropped, or whatever.
Bitcoin hasn't really taken off yet, except with a minority of tech-heads who can relatively-easily switch to Litecoin or Dash if necessary.
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:13:56

The Chinese miners have agreed to 8MB.  They just don't want to move away from Core.

"I'm working on a tech startup — The next Google!  We only have 10 users right now but there could be millions more once this thing kicks off!  I'm just about to deploy a new 'smell search' feature that will take the world by storm!"
**12 months later...**
*"How's your startup going Fred?"*
"It's not going too badly, but Google launched a smell search that has taken most of our customers away."
*"Oh, why didn't they stick with you?"*
"Well, my website is a special kind of website that needs ideally to be upgraded 9 months in advance.  It could only handle 15 users at a time, and I didn't want to increase the capacity until we hit 14 so as not to waste money.
We never did hit 14 users as the website got too slow when there were 12+ users, so people never really got into it as much as they are doing nowadays on Google."

An 8MB limit is extremely conservative.

What's important is not standing in the way of a technology that has the potential for rapid growth.  Could Bitcoin handle a 50x+ increase in users this year?  Why does Bitcoin adoption seem to have slowed down?
The longer we go without cryptocurrencies being mass-market, the more chance governments have to nip them in the bud by enacting wild KYC schemes or just plain making them illegal to transact in.
It's really not practical for everyone to run a full node without severely limiting Bitcoin.  That's why we have SPV.  As described in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Nobody's talking about doubling the block size.  This debate is about the MAXIMUM block size.  The block size limit.
@_date: 2016-01-09 12:44:54
We need to get as many people as possible using cryptos ASAP to make it harder for governments to enact legislations against cryptos (like even more AML/KYC or disfavourable tax rules).

They're not running XT because they don't want to move away from Core.  They expect that dev consensus can resolve scaling issues.


Even without a soft limit, blocks wouldn't necessarily be full, or anywhere close to full.
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:14:53
Spam will never stop.
Nobody was using the bitcoin network back then for anything real beyond testing.  So the cap seemed to make sense.
Nowadays people are storing their money in bitcoin and businesses want to invest in bitcoin solutions.  So it's no good having full blocks.  Blocks shouldn't be anywhere close to full.
New tech can grow by 10x or more a year.  Bitcoin can't, partly because of this cap, hence the stagnation in adoption.
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:46:20
Businesses would be using the bitcoin blocktime all the time, instead of going to the effort of making their own custom solutions... If the blocksize limit would increase significantly.  Not much point investing in bitcoin solutions when blocks are clogged already.
(As for LN, SW and whatnot, none of those things are ready yet and should have at least a year of testing first.)

It's Bitcoin users who tend to run nodes.  (And Bitcoin-using organisations.)
If those entities stop using Bitcoin because it costs $$$ to send a transaction, them they'll probably stop running Bitcoin nodes too.  They'll run altcoin nodes instead perhaps.
Satoshi believed this would be a simple change, to increase the blocksize limit when it was time to do so.  He didn't forsee a company wanting to grab profit from sidechains/second-layer solutions taking control of development of the Core client.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:10:04
It's important to have nodes in many different jurisdictions and different geographical locations.
(But if it costs me $5+ to do anything with Bitcoin I'd probably just use an altcoin instead.)

Stop using blockchain.info.  Use something else like blokr.io instead.
'Blockchain' are intentionally confusing people as to what the blockchain is and who owns it, have had poor wallet security, and have gotten people in trouble with police (for some kind of child porn thing) by listing their IP address in relation to a transaction (but the node actually only relayed the transaction).

And look at the squabbling that's caused.  And you aren't going to fix the blocktime or emission rate.
It'd be nice if we could all get rich from hodling bitcoin but realistically it's not going to happen -- BTC will be looking second-rate in a year or two compared to DRK or XMR.

1) Not really true.
2) Even it were true, the extra granularity would be helpful.
3) Bitcoin doesn't consistently have 10 min confirmations.  Miners are mining hard for a short time and then switching to altcoins or turning off their equipment while the difficulty is high.  What's being done about this?  Nothing, so far as I can tell.

If only there was a protocol whereby light users could just download the small parts of the blockchain that they need.
If only Satoshi had realised that it wasn't practical for every laptop and mobile to store every financial transaction in the world, and had specified such a protocol in the bitcoin whitepaper.

They won't like to hear this here, but Bitcoin is in danger of being outcompeted by:

- anonymous cryptocurrencies

If people were using $38 billion dollars-worth of bitcoin to buy things on Amazon, then it's likely that the market cap of bitcoin would be at least 38 billion dollars, which would make the price $x.
That's the point.  He's making a comparison so we can see how small BTC is and how much growth potential it has.  So yes, you can compare gross revenue of a company and market cap of a currency.
