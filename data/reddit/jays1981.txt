You do realize markets require people to sell in order to operate? If no one is willing to sell, no one makes any profit.
You can simply hodl if you want, but theres money to be made if you watch the trends.
Thanks for being an asshole without an understanding of economics though.

It does when there is a finite supply, hence why it needs sellers.  Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing but calling me names.

I cant imagine it would be that hard to get someone to transfer $100 worth of bitcoin in exchange for money sent via paypal.

Read your post, if no ones willing to sell, YOUR bitcoin has no value.  It's worth ~9300 right now because people are will to pay that and others are willing to sell for it.  Without both sides, you dont have shit.

Yea. I can see trust being an issue.

That's how you make money chief.

If you wanting to hold in a private wallet then all this shouldnt matter, atleast I wouldnt think so.  Being on an exchange only matters if you want to trade.  I mine eth and convert to bitcoin so its easiest for me to be on the exchange, especially since bittrex added dollar tender.

The last dip was a good 1.5k,  I made about 10% off it, but I was definitely sweating when to buy.

You can do that with altcoins but how do you pick?  For every one that sees that growth, theres a hundred that just lose value.
