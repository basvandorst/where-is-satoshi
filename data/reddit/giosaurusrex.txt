vapor wave?? Like the music genre? Love that shit 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:19
Okay, but the bitcoin guy in the rollercoaster is not your original drawing. (Not in this piece of yours) but the idea and ORIGINAL drawing itself is not yours, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:12:14
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:15:00
I'm just wondering if this is the original bitcoin artist guy, it's not. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:54:11
Oh, so you took someone's drawing, copied it and then elaborated on?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:35:48
Well, you're an asshole then
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:05:10
Haha holy shit, how insane! Hope u find it !

Little thing called YouTube does a great job.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:06:19
Haven't heard this point yet. Isn't the fact that it's impossible to counterfeit BTC relevant? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:25:58
Can someone explain what "futures" are please 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:11
I agree. I don't wanna say that stick of gum costs 2,400 satoshis (for example)
I'd rather say it's 1 lambo and 20 satoshis.

I just have questions mannnnn
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:19
Made by who and where?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:56
Fibanacci, a famous Italian opera singer.

Oh Jesus, this really is the Wild West
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:53:56
This is super interesting. Do you have more videos of doing this? Also what site it that? Seems the most organized.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:57:05
My god....
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:41:20
lol I see you've removed your explanation. Idiot.

Wow, u drew the rollercoaster meme? Love it
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:42:20
Do you wanna bet some of your shit BCH, that BTC passes 13k?
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:39:45
No one sounds like an idiot but you here. You believe in a knock off shit coin with a leader who is strictly money oriented..
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:10:42
No, I'm not thinking you copy pasted. I'm an artist myself. I'm just making sure you didn't come up with that drawing itself. 
It's like if i panted the Trix rabbit, exactly like the trix rabbit, but in a different setting. I didn't come up with the Trix rabbit, I copied him... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:00:37
Now...that's your original bitcoin guy huh? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:45:03

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:55:58
You're not in bitcoin for the reasons bitcoin is about. So, that's definitely more asshole like. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:20:52
everyday we pray for u!
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:37:13
Are you going to continue this argument when it's worth 50k?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:33:27
You're amazing man. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:22
Is it your own tho if you just copied the rollercoaster bitcoin guy? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:08:22
It's the same in the sense that people are confused to a new technology and want to learn about it..
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:24:35
Hahaha this is too funny.
Ok for reals what is it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:35:46

Doesn't sound like it! What is a school whore

Are you willing to eat your left testicle if it does? Please let everyone know. I hope you're hungry

This is awesome! Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:46:02
He's still got a point with the internet. Yeah, there are plenty of things about how the internet works to a common user that are a complete mystery...they still use the internet and don't care.  My mom doesn't know what a "server" is, she uses the internet all day..

FRANCO MANCA ONLY!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:55:55
Awesome! I'm curious, if you got in a month ago, you must have had a very large investment to have this kind of life changing effect? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:26:55
Haha holy shit, how dumb can you be? You just admitted you use the N Word and like it. Doesn't mean your racist at all. Yeah no way. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:18:10
Pshhh, you might be misinformed with the state of jobs nowadays. Especially if you live in CA. It's a desert out there. I wish you HEDL  longer
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:28:22
This. Absolutely, it's literally dangerous if you don't know real from fake nowadays.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:52:02
Can't wait til this says 50k
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:39:36
What about Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:40:27
People lose Fiat as well all the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:11:23
Is it 6.5btc now? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:48:57
I thought it's a mockery of what people think bitcoin is. Some kinda magic spell some wizards (nerds) made up..
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:17:34
Ah, so glad you finally outted yourself as racist. I can stop conversing with you now that my point is proven. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:07:34

Hello, this is dog.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:07:57
I don't see why you couldn't. I think most people are just investing in BTC and in it for the long run and also know how much higher it's going to go. 
I'd day day trade the altcoins. HODL ur BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:54:52
Chicken butt. What the fuck u think? 100k!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:41
I'm sorry, but it's not at the top of r/bitcoin hence why you have to come to New Posts and post about it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:00:45
Where's the video to this
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:39:58
You won't have enough to get you math tutor lessons...
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:17:12
Thanks! Seems are technology progresses, things will go faster. I'm sure we'll see 21mil sooner than later 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:44:37
This dude doesn't deserve attention. He's kicked women in the face at clubs...
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:07:19
You're right. This is pretty crazy.
HEY SETTLE DOWN BACK THERE KIDS OR IM PULLING THIS CAR OVER!
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:04:50
Fuck outta here with that noise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:43:17
lol this costs money? Hilarious 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:32:53
How are you gonna accept a label as racist but say there's no such thing as racism? You think there's no such thing as racists because we over use the word? I could start calling people ducks over and over again all the time, doesn't mean there aren't such thing as ducks..
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:19
That was just nuts. TIMBERRRR!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:20:35
You seem like the fun guy at the party. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:31:35
In one hour, eight minutes and 37 seconds.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:24:56
Doesn't sound like a healthy combo 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:54:14
You gotta know when to HODL em,
Know when to HODL em,
Know when to HODL HODL,
Know when to HODL.
You never count ur bitcoin, 
When your sittin on the exchange,
There'll be time enough for countin,
When the moon is reached. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:21:08
I'm not labeling you. You've labeled yourself by your intelligence/ignorance level. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:13:49
Why why why bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:40:43
Not on HODL
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:43:59
Okay, now this is even more thick, you gambled your entire live savings.... with a wife and kid?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:21:29
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:21:40
And you're not gonna tell us this survey site? Would love to try this out..
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:23:28
Awful. This is about unifying 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:17:48
I would tattoo myself. Stick n poke. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:08:16
Okay, so just to clarify, no, you didn't gamble your life savings without the parachute of well-off, set-for-life family money. Sorry man, but anyone WITHOUT the cushion of family money, would never gamble their life savings with a wife and kid. Unless they're bat shit crazy. I call bullshit. Don't say you gambled life savings when you come from money. Jesus Christ. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:34:58
Yeah, no. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:50:09
This is fuckin amazing 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:06:53
True about having an easy UI for people. Side note; That's not a nice term.

Nice try JPMorgan.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:34:57
 Think we'll hit 8k soon then drop down to the mid 6k range. Then you should buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:22:51
My god, if they can't handle this kind of traffic, they need to really get their shit together. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:00:14
You gambled your life savings? Wow. Would you have been totally homeless if it all went to shit? Balls of steel.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:17:30
Um what?
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:49:26
I actually don't. Where?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:51:40
You're gonna kick your own face when it rockets to 50k... HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:57:16
You got some good vision if you can memorize a 24 character long key with your tongue 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:30:21
No adoption? I have at least one new person a day asking about bitcoin and what it is. This is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:12
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:51:08
Where's the link?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:40:18
I'm Gonna say there will be a HUGE correction after 10k from people selling off. Then I'll get to buy :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:39:04
Boring? Mannnn this shit is dope bro
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:55:13
Wowww! The simple fact that he had to try and top the interviewers amount of money he makes per year is a sure tell of how corrupt and greedy he is. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:37:06
He's completely right. Why are you coming on here to just ask for free money from people?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:06:19
You've been a redditor for two days. Go back to your moms hole where you came from and stop trying to scam people out of their money/bitcoin. I could imagine it's hard trying to get business with how much of an asshole you are and how little your penis is. At least you can fix one of those things.
Leave. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:03:04
Oh Jesus Christ. So dumb. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:45:36

Yes, this is dog.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:01:36
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:28:26
2,000 bitcoins or 2k worth of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:29:12
$8100 to sell? Bruh, HODL
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:15:58
I could live 6 years off that play money mannnn
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:50
Please fuck off with the bubble talk
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:34:43
This reminds me, im going to tattoo mine to my inner thigh..
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:38:24
And if you own 0.45 of a coin and the price doubles, you've made a nicer return...
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:24:28
Leave. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:37:20
It didn't hit yet
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:40:45
How about inner bottom lip?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:42
I'm surprised you even got that far. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:11:31
