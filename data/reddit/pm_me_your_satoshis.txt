Bitcoin Cash 2, because Bitcoin Cash 2, is Bitcoin Cash too

i could cough up 210k (by mortgaging my parent's house), can't forget about all them sweet forks
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:44:37
if this manipulation is so strong and keeping bitcoin so low, i wonder how easy/high it can get when they want it to rise...
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:05:06
i am assuming your in USA by the way, make sure you speak to your tax dude about it
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:00:41

"Bitcoin crashed to $50,000... is the bubble ponzi scheme dead again?"
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:15:24
first in first out would make the first bitcoin you bought, be the first one sold in this designation... i bought a bitcoin in March, and i didnt even touch it, so if i used LIFO, i'd be paying 25-28% tax on my first bitcoin... with HIFO, all the trades i did after would not include that bitcoin, and so after a year of holding that bitcoin i would pay 15% of taxes.... 
edit: basically, you don;t want to designate your holding coins into higher tax brackets
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:01:31
file and claim capital losses, you can claim up to 3000 one year, and the rest of the losses you can claim in later years...
edit: coininfo.tracking &lt;--- site for helping you do your taxes
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:57:23
I'm using HIFO, (highest cost first out).... you can pick any designation you want, just like a business can
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:01:57
too much
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:27:47
4k, dam, i'd just put my 401k and reverse mortgage my house if that happened
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:29:17
its up to Coinbase's discretion, they won't give you every fork, and even if they give one, its really late, as you saw with the Bcash scandal
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:28:23
lmao i thought it was i-own-a-valuable-block-chain.com
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:22:53
in the most recent tax bill
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:53:24
i paid 7 grand for one just this past week :\
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:44:29
bitcoin would have to be 29,670 for that cap... the total market cap of all cryptos reached over 800billion at one point
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:35:26
thats why i said you should still report them, to avoid any discrepancies
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:18:00
he's on top of his shit
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:06:27
New Cryprocurrency Legislation... new cryptoruble, can't wait
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:29:40
thanks for the update, but how do you know this? are there are any good websites that keep track?
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:21:48
50,000 dollar bitcoin would mean there is a 850 bill market cap from Bitcoin alone... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:12:48
isn't it like 50% cuz of coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:52:46
not assume Coinbase is scamming people...
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:06:02
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:12:01
я тоже брат
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:27:06
7k was already too good to be true xD
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:20:42
in 2017 and before, not every crypto trade was taxable, although you should report it, you didnt have to pay gains on crypto to crypto trades... if you hold anything for more than 1 year, you pay a 15% tax on long term capital gains (at least in the US)... the same goes for stocks
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:12:31
Coinmarketcap+Cryptocurrency news, maybe where users can select which coins they want to keep track, and what news they want to receive. I'd find that very helpful...
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:07:03
found the bot that downvotes everything!
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:10:50
