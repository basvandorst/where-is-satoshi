It's a log chart, I forgot to mention that. You could plot it linearly as well, but that makes it really hard to see what happened before the nineties:

On large timescales, the stock market always looks like a bubble when plotted linearly, even when it's at an all-time low. That doesn't prove anything.

Not really. My point is that OP's claim that we're currently obviously in a stock market bubble is incorrect. I'm not trying to go into a debate about whether the entire stock market is one big long-term bubble and whether we should worry about that. I don't feel like having that debate right now.

If you include older data, you get a really different picture:  The stock market is obviously always unpredictable, but it doesn't sound unlikely that this is just a correction.

I'm pretty sure you mean this video:

It just prints out all those "grains of sand". Except it only computes them for a certain page when you request that page. And it has 904625697166532776746648320380374280100293470930272690489102837043110636675 pages. So sure, every possible Bitcoin address is on there, but you don't know on what page, and there are way too many pages to search through. And on a huge majority of the pages (99.999...% with many, many nines), none of the addresses have any Bitcoins on them.
It's not fake, it's just a joke as a "directory" like that is completely useless, it just divides the huge address space into "pages" of addresses, it doesn't change the fundamental problem that when looking at a random address, the probability that it has any Bitcoins is 0,000...0001% with many, many zeroes.
The reason why you can sometimes find an address that had money on it is because you're not clicking on a random address. E.g. if you click on the first few, the last few, the thousandth, ... They are not random and jokers/dumb people have stored money there which was then quickly removed again. But the probability that your Bitcoin software will generate one of those is incredibly tiny. If you pick a truly random address I'll guarantee you it won't have money.

Also, even if electric heating is the best option, heat pumps are way more efficient than the simple resistive heating of Bitcoin mining. So this only works if the Bitcoins you mine are worth more than the kWhs of heat you could pump into your house. Or if the initial investment in a Bitcoin miner is lower than the initial investment in a heat pump.

So, you definitely did the right thing morally, but depending on where you and the website are, it's also probably the only legal thing. In most places you're not allowed to keep an accidental money transfer, and while a Bitcoin transfer can't be automatically reversed obviously, 38 BTC is enough money that they will probably take you to court over it. To the people here saying they would have considered keeping it because they're in financial trouble: it's really not a good idea, and especially not if you can't afford a lawyer.
