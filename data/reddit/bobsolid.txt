You obviously know what you're talking about, to a much greater extent than I do, and you tempered my enthusiasm about BTC quite a bit here. I wanted to make two points though:


I just wanted to point out that Chartalism is a controversial theory of money creation and is not at all uncontroversial or even the most prevalent. You have perhaps unintentionally presented this as if it's a fact.


This seems a weird example to use given that it is widely known that an essentially analogous situation has already happened with electric cars, even involving specifically the company you name. And in much the same way, *some* financial executives and professionals have incentive to discourage adoption of cryptocurrency. They absolutely have "wisdom to impart", but according to well established psychological truths their thinking is likely to be, consciously or otherwise, somewhat biased against what could be construed as a rival.
Anyway, thanks for the information. I was wondering, do you hold or support any cryptocurrencies yourself? If so, which coins and why? Not that I'm instantly going to go out and invest, but I'd be interested in hearing which coins if any you think have more long-term potential than BTC. Thanks.

You certainly shouldn't use it as your savings account. That's investing more than you can afford to lose. Unless you mean 'as one of several savings accounts', in which case fair play.

It is by definition immune to hyperinflation.

This is pretty melodramatic. I only bought in for the first time a few weeks ago and I haven't been subscribed here for long, and I've already seen plenty of thoughtful, moderate sentiment and even outright scepticism about the long term value of BTC.
Even if you were right there's really no need to be calling people names. I'd say that's rather more immature than being optimistic about Bitcoin.

Yeah I think that's his point basically:

But no-one said any of those things
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:53:42
So basically it doesn't matter? Are the rates identical wherever you buy?
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:37:32
OK, well I think given my relative ignorance of the topic I should stick to Bitcoin itself for now.
The second question, then, is: where do I buy it? I know you can buy some easily online, but is this the best way to do it if you are buying to hold as an investment?

Just under a year ago, and I lived there for more than that and there was no noticeable change whatsoever over that time. The WeChat/AliPay method has been established and entrenched for many years now. They're well ahead of us in that regard. But there was no sign of the diminishing value of cash.
I suppose it's possible, strictly speaking, that it's all changed in a year, many years after the introduction and widespread adoption of electronic payments, but I would wager with confidence that it has not. I think it's more likely that simply saw examples of the electronic payment that he spoke of and assumed that it was the only way people paid.

OK so if we think it's going to "crash" and then hit all-time highs, when and how should I invest if I want to start getting in on Bitcoin (as I've been thinking about for a while)? Or is there another crypto that would be better to get in on as a novice?

Nah man Lambos are cool I'm going to buy one if I can afford it

Bullshit, I paid with WeChat and AliPay constantly but I literally never encountered a single shop/vendor/anything where I couldn't also pay with cash if I wanted. In fact occasionally people, especially taxi drivers, would be slightly annoyed by my paying electronically. You're right that almost everywhere does have a QR code as well, though.
