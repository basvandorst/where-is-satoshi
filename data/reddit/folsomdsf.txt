If you've ever actually made purchases of 10k+ it's the easiest thing in the world. 
Seriously, do you know how easy people make it to spend that kind of dosh on the regular? If you think it's hard.. I have to break it to you, you're not the customer they usually deal with.

The bigger problem is when gpu mining is abandoned because of difficulty. they are well aware people are going to move on.

Nvidia doesn't support more than 2 cards in a machine for anything but compute. It's not hard to figure out when nvidia NO LONGER SUPPORTS more than 2 cards for anything but compute which is independent.

You are not a repeat customer that is high value actually. They want brand loyalty and long term profits. You are neither. If they produce 600,000 of a device that was going to sell anyhow you're just hurting future profits by being a fickle customer that isn't going to be a useful repeat when you move on.
If someone sells a gtx 1080ti at 1200 USD, nvidia doesn't make a cent more than if they sold it at the price they already sold it to the retailer/distributor/wholesaler(however that particular retailer gets it).

Only the mentally handicapped believe this. Price gouging is retailer profits not manufacturer profits. The manufacturers sell at X price in Y volume. That X price is set down the line up till the store where the retailers gouge.

The first part is actually the reason its' not taken seriously. It doesn't have the full weight of an armed military force willing to back up it's value. You think people value money because it's valuable? No, they value money because you give them no choice and you have the manpower to back it up.
Right now there's no reason for anyone to actually accept it except for taking a chance.

Allow me to gift you all with the 'wonderful' things that has to say when they don't know what they're talking about.

FTFY, the sustainability of gpu mining is well known to be finite. Dedicated devices will replace gpus again for pennies on the dollar and flood the market.

the one they already found you had. Hint, if the IRS is asking you about it, it's because they already have proof when it comes to audits and such.

FYI, if the IRS is asking you to present information about money, it means they already have proof of it existing. They are giving /you/ a chance to prove that it doesn't exist(you spent it) for instance. The onus is on /you/ to prove it.

FYI, a summons in this case is an order to present it. They can indeed do this, and if you fail to do it, /you/ will be in contempt of court.

Motherfucker, you literally tried to compare it to gold. Also the electronics market is the biggest purchaser of gold on the planet soooooo..
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:09:14


Problem, bitcoin isn't gold. Bitcoin has no inherent value in industry. If gold disappeared tomorrow electronics would be in trouble. If bitcoin disappeared tomorrow? Nothing in the real world is impacted.

FYI, the drop happened from 20-9, this is now a steady decline. They don't really like people pointing that out though.
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:12:43


without people buying it doesn't hit that high. Remember that bitcoin is WORTHLESS without people to buy it with goods or services. It has no inherent value, it has no worth besides what someone will pay for it. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:06:45
Sorry, the crash was 20-9. 
Now it's just a steady decline
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:05:17


FYI, when used for a block chain this has no actual value fyi.


One of these is inherently not like the other.
you tried to spam a bunch of stuff but your entire premise is wrong. I don't think you understand at all what inherent value is.
Gold has inherent value, bitcoin does not. Bitcoin has no industrial use, I cannot use it as a conductor. I cannot make a wire out of it.
