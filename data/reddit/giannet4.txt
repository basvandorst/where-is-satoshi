Yup, sorry I'm not on reddit very often. Just saw this post. Order eventually filled

Awesome. Thanks guys! 
Also, I have some litcoin with Btc-e but am kinda worried about keeping them there long-term. Ideas for a safe, cloud litecoin wallet?

Why don't we just change both names. BTC are legacy coins that are valid on both chains. BU (bitcoin unlimited) and BC (bitcoin core) are the coins that were created after the split

Thanks guys!
Bitcoiners are the best

I haven't seen the card and it was supposed to ship out on November 3rd. I actually moved addresses as well (a friend still lives at the original address so he should be able to get it for me), but i'm getting kinda worried it was sent and I didn't receive it.

Ok cool. Thanks for replying, I did order the card you are referring to. Looking forward to using it!

Why is it highly unlikely? Please explain your rationale instead of dismissing the suggestion

Good to know. Def sent to the right address just waiting for the pending to go away
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:54:08
yeah, ok. Obvious answer and probably a stupid thread. Just seems odd that it's not showing up in the orders section for me to cancel. This should be a non-issue

I'm asking about verifying a message from a bitcoin wallet in cold storage that I own. How is that the wrong sub?
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:21:40
What happened in this transaction? I was pulling some of my coins from an exchange and putting them into cold storage. It looks like the middle address transaction got lost in cyberspace? The 2nd receive address is "spent output." 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:28:59
Ah, I got you. Thanks! So the fee's listed are the ones that i'm paying to miners, and the spent transaction is what the exchange skims off the top. Expensive to move coins around!

Can't use a pc? All I'd have to do is join a group and then we'd share the coins... right? mccorvic, a pc with a good card would work? If the coins continue to increase in value then mining becomes more economic

Well I need a new computer anyways so I figured it would be a good time to start. I like the long-term appeal of bitcoin. The purchase wouldn't be solely to mine. It would be nice to have a cool setup
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:06:29
Right, but my computer sucks... I need a rig. I'm just wondering if you have any advise as to a site where I could customize a new computer / something of the sort
