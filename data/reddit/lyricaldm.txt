Interesting, and good advice. I'll see what I can find scrolling through my FB contacts.

Well, this is my first time... both on this sub and for bitcoin! Unless you mean you've seen others with similar plights?

Haha I'm sure I'd come off as a complete tool, begging for change in bitcoin on facebook. Maybe I'll try another option first :P

Hmmm... I don't suppose I've ever asked anyone if they do! That's a great idea.

I think a lot of people get confused over stuff like Bitcoin—it's pretty new and all online, where a lot of people (like me!) get falsely overconfident that they know what they're doing. I can't imagine there's much malicious or greedy intent over a matter of something like 1 USD, although of course *someone's* got the smarts to figure a way to get rich with it I'm sure!

Looks like it lets me withdraw to my Localbitcoinswallet no problem. :D Lemme buy you a beer if you ever swing by Warsaw, PL.

Sheer brilliance—unless I need to buy the felt pen with btc!

Wise advice, sensei. I'm a knucklehead. Then again, cryptocurrency is the way of the future. Normal people money has all sorts of downsides compared to this stuff... Or so it will once I figure out how to use Localbitcoins properly!

Haha, I hadn't heard of it until you wrote this. Interesting; I'll have to check it out.
