I’m running a node on an old computer at home which I basically never use. So there is no direct usage by anyone, all it does is relay transactions/blocks.
Is this node running old software (which presumably includes the bug) detrimental to the network? If so I can turn it off, and I can of course update to 0.16.3 as well. I’m just wondering in general if old “inactive” nodes have an effect on the network

If the majority of the hash power and economic activity would happen on the 8mb chain then yes it would be the real bitcoin. There's nothing unreasonable about it. The only unreasonable thing is defending those who fork off with minority consensus and then try to label their fork as "the real bitcoin", even going as far as trying to sell their forked coins to newcomers. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:59:18
Immoral, possibly illegal (?), not clear how much there is to gain. 5% of the hash power equals roughly 4btc an hour which the attacker would lose while executing the attack.

People were opposed to it for different reasons. If it had been successful and would have kept consensus it would be the real bitcoin. The truth is that miners signalled it for a brief while, then backed out. The client implementing segwit2x turned out to be littered with consensus bugs, and there was never a single block mined on that chain. There really is no point in even discussing it now

I will say I found his medium article pretty good but this was just poorly executed all around.
Roger.. well he’s Roger. He does make good points from time to time and he’s got a knack for talking, but he also rebuttals with “i’ll bet you a million dollars..” - I really wish he’d stay out of the technical discussions (like block size) and would focus on speaking for cryptocurrencies in general.

@_date: 2018-09-05 23:33:35
Because the blockchain can't handle the required transaction load without being compromised in the sense that it would lose it's most important qualities, namely decentralization. LN makes each transaction on the blockchain that more meaningful by allowing basically unlimited off-chain transaction for every on-chain transaction that is made - it massively increases the networks throughput without compromising the base layer.  
I´m not sure why you think bitcoin development is centralized, LN is a great example of why it isn't. A new protocol is being built on top of the existing base protocol (bitcoin) and with it comes a ton of interesting development from independent developers. 
Also, the fact that you think that bitcoins architecture hasn't changed since Satoshi would lead anyone with a clue to think you're either being disingenuous or you simply have no idea what's going on it bitcoin development

At first you need to create a private key. It should only be known by you and nobody else.  
A private key is a 256 bit number. You could, for example, generate one yourself by tossing a coin 256 times and writing down the outcome.  
Since a private key is a 256 bit number, there are 2\^256 different private keys in existence, which is roughly the same as the number of atoms in the visible universe (so A LOT).  
Once you have your private key, the next step is to generate a public key. Bitcoin uses something called Elliptic Curve Cryptography to generate public keys from private keys. Multiplication is defined on the elliptic curve as taking a number (the private key) and multiplying it with a predetermined point on the curve called the Generator point. The outcome of this operation is another point on the curve, and becomes your public key. This is an irreversible operation, that is, given the outcome (public key) and the Generator point, there is no way to calculate the input (private key).  
So basically, public keys are generated from private keys by using very complicated math, and it's impossible to learn someone's private key by knowing their public key.  
Then you have addresses. They are generated from public keys, by hashing the public key twice (first with SHA256, then with RIPEMD160), creating a public key hash, and then Base58Check encoding that hash to get the bitcoin address.  
Addresses are really just an alternative to public keys, they're not strictly necessary. You can also send bitcoin to a public key (P2PK, pay-to-public-key), but addresses offer some advantages, they're more compact and considered harder to break (by quantum computers).
But it really all starts with the private key. Everything else can be deterministically generated from it.   
And to start using your new private/public key pair and bitcoin address on the network, you simply send some bitcoin to it. There is no notion of "putting it online". You could for example generate a private/public key yourself by hand (although I imagine creating the public key is very complicated), then send some bitcoin to the public key, and then lock the private key away forever, or even remembering it in your head. It doesn't have to be brought online ever unless you want to access your bitcoin. So you can literally travel across borders with a hundred million dollars in your head.

I feel like we're going in circles here. I really don't see a difference in spending fiat, or converting my fiat to Bitcoin and spending Bitcoin. Note I'm not ever talking about saving USD here, of course that wouldn't make any sense.
I can only speak for myself, but if Bitcoin was equally accepted as fiat is today, then I would rather choose to spend Bitcoin. I wouldn't care about Bitcoin appreciating in value and fiat depreciating because I wouldn't hold any fiat anyway. Would I acquire some through getting paid etc I'd instantly convert it into Bitcoin

I'm sure you see the benefits Bitcoin has over cash, that are not cost\-related, no?
Maybe I should have been more clear, what I would have liked to have said is that if I could transact with Bitcoin *directly* I would. It would indeed provide no benefit to use a third\-party service to essentially convert my Bitcoin back to fiat before spending

Ever heard the phrase "3-5 business days" 
New transactions take a couple of days to appear on my overview of credit card transactions, it's not real time but rather nightly batch jobs that update that list. It's painfully slow and uninformative. Today's banking system is really slow, Bitcoin will be miles faster. Transactions won't take 10 minutes 5 years from now, they'll be instant
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:49:28
If there are no added fees when using a 3rd party to pay with Bitcoin, I'd most definitely do it as that would mean I could discard fiat completely and only own Bitcoin. I haven't looked into it but I doubt this is the case.
Yes the main benefit that will drive adoption for digital transactions is that it's cheaper. The main reason it will replace cash is that cash becomes less relevant as digital transactions start to more closely resemble it in terms of price, privacy etc. Cash may very well still be used throughout \(as well as fiat\), that's not really what I'm discussing here.
I don't feel like this conversation is going anywhere. I think we'll just have to see how things progress 
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:47:09
You don’t need a channel with everyone you transact with. It’s a routed network, ie payments get routed from sender to receiver through intermediary nodes. Ln fees will very likely be extremely low, almost negligible. On-chain fees might be high at times, it really depends on how things evolve as we go forward. But a design goal of LN developers is to minimise the amount of needed on-chain transactions. Once you finish the onboarding process, you could conceivably transact solely off-chain almost indefinitely. This is one of the issues that haven’t been fully ironed out, but it’s not likely you’ll have to hit the blockchain often at all once you’re on Lightning
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:45:47


As soon as the fees are similar to regular visa transactions with fiat and it's of similar convenience. It's not a big deal for me anyway so atm I'm not looking into using a 3rd party payment\-processor for Bitcoin\-to\-fiat payments.










You're grossly misinterpreting what I'm saying. The replacement of cash due to convenience has already happened with the introduction of payment cards. Those still using cash use it because it in some way more convenient or cheaper for them, one would have to assume. When Bitcoin becomes more prominent, it will presumably replace cash for whatever use case it's still being used for today.

@_date: 2018-05-01 13:14:00
I understand your point. I also think things will develop in such a way that this won't be a problem. 
I assure you that if I could spend Bitcoin today I would. As the ecosystem matures we will see Bitcoin being used increasingly as an everyday currency. There are undeniable benefits it offers over fiat, main one that will drive market adoption is that it's cheaper. At some point there won't be any reason for a lot of people to deal with fiat at all, as it becomes possible to only transact in Bitcoin.
I kind of get where you're coming from, but I really don't see this as an issue. Obviously this is just my view on things and we've yet to see how this whole thing plays out
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:29:41
Yes you’ll be able to do that. There is an initial onboarding process where you basically fund your Lightning wallet (depending on the implementation, this might for example open a few channels for you in the background, with the goal of getting you very well connected within the network), but after that the idea is that you can simply pay anyone, by scanning a QR code for example
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:09:12
This is basically what Lightning aims to solve, so yes

At a protocol level I'd say the two big things that are continuously being worked on are decreasing the odds of lost funds and increasing the odds of successful transactions.
Then of course a lot of work will have to be put into UI/UX, but I'd imagine this will mostly come from independent developers.
@_date: 2019-03-22 00:46:18
That’s how I understand it, yes. 
From my understanding it basically works like this:
A has an open channel with B, and he wants to either a) receive funds on-chain in exchange for funds in the channel, or b) receive funds in the channel in exchange for funds on-chain.
And so A either pays LL through the channel with B, and receives an on-chain transaction from LL instead, or A pays LL on-chain and LL routes a payment to A’s node through the channel with B.
It’s cryptographically enforced and the idea is originally known as a Submarine Swap (by Alex Bosworth who is now a LL dev) so it’s non-custodial / trust-less. 
You can look through the docs on Github to find some of the potential use cases (they did list a few). It can be used for example to “withdraw” funds from a channel to on-chain without closing the channel or “refilling” a channel with an on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:27:55
The point is that you wouldn't need an on-chain transaction for each opened channel, but rather channels can be opened/closed at will from within other channels. It's not entirely clear to me how this will work, and I think it's somewhat theoretical still, but for further reading I suggest looking up *channel factories.*
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:57:19
I'm not sure what the updated channels stat means exactly but afaik it's pretty much impossible to estimate the number of transactions on LN to any degree of certainty.  I'm pretty sure theoretically two nodes on the network could do millions of transactions per second back and forth to each other, with an open channel between them (ie "direct" transactions, as opposed to routed) - The only limitation would be bandwidth and/or processing power.
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:54:37
Is it worth watching? Seems to be getting kinda mixed reviews..
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:07:06
This looks really good in my opinion. I think the idea of being able to *click to convert* instead of having to do it through some settings subsection makes it much more user friendly as you can easily navigate between the three choices, if you're uncertain on the true value of say *215.95 bits.*
I also think we really need something like bits, the jump between bitcoin and satoshi is simply too big
@_date: 2018-10-25 00:35:19


Note that it's not only about one coin being harder to create. The energy goes into securing the network, making sure noone can rewrite history and revert your transactions. Bitcoins massive PoW makes it such that once you transact, after a relatively short amount of time (hours) you can basically be sure with \~99.99% certainty that it's physically impossible to alter your transaction

There are other benefits to keeping your channels balanced, for example there has been ongoing worry about the possibility of theft attempts on the LN, but if channels are kept closer to being balanced than heavily weighted towards one end it increases the risk of attempting to cheat and thus reduces the risk of attempted thefts. 
This merge probably shouldn't be hyped up to be something it isn't. But it is a small improvement on the LN, one that allows manual path-choosing, it definitely has a lot of use cases, and it's yet another example of how LN is moving in an incredible direction.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:44:56
Yup this definitely seems strange to me. No penalties seem like it will make cheating attempts much more common, and although it lessens the storage requirements of watchtowers (since they don’t need to store every single old channel state) it seems to thoroughly increase the need for very reliant watchtowers. Maybe this is a better solution than the old one with penalties but heavy storage requirements for nodes/watchtowers, but penalties are very effective defences against cheating attempts though.
I guess this also fixes the problem where nodes with old backups broadcast old states accidentally and lose their funds as a penalty. It’s definitely interesting nonetheless that Eltoo removes penalties.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:03:29
I was kind of under the impression that Schnorr would also work for inputs signed with different private keys, and that the keys would be somehow combined into one aggregate key. Can you confirm that this is not true, and does schnorr offer any kind of improvement over regular multi-input transactions if we have say 3 inputs with 3 different private keys?
@_date: 2019-02-19 21:54:14
As stated in their Medium post, there are no watchtowers implemented yet. Rather they force a two week retaliation window (time period where if the other party broadcasts an old channel state, you can broadcast a revocation transaction and claim all the channel funds), and they implemented a lightweight process that runs periodically on your phone which checks whether a transaction related to your channels has been broadcast. If it notices that someone is attempting to broadcast an old channel state, it will notify you via a notification to your phone, prompting you to open the Eclair Mobile app and broadcast a revocation transaction.  
Definitely not perfect at all, but it's something.
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:47:51
When a channel is opened the two parties agree on amounts called the *channel reserve* which is the minimum amount a node must keep on their side of the channel at any time. This serves to prevent the scenario where one side of the channel is not entitled to any of the channel funds, and thus can attempt to steal "for free".
It is discussed in detail in the [Lightning Network Specifications]( \- search for *channel\_reserve\_satoshis*

*Good luck explaining to users that some of the money in their Bitcoin wallet disappeared because someone broadcasted a prior channel state and their watchtower for some reason didn't catch it.*

You'd then be foolish to own any fiat in the first place. If bitcoin becomes as convenient of a payment method as fiat, and bitcoins value rises while fiats drops, then there is no reason for you to still have fiat. Since all your money is now bitcoin, you will of course start spending it.
The argument that bitcoin can't become a MOE because people would rather spend fiat doesn't really make sense imo. The logic behind it is that bitcoins grows in value compared to fiat, but in that case, you'd rather have all your money as bitcoin anyway

The simplest way afaik would be to import your private keys into a wallet software (Electrum for example). Note I’ve never done it and I’d do it with caution.
Try googling import private keys. Pick a wallet that is very reputable and take precaution to download the real software (preferably signed, from their official site). Make sure your computer is completely malware free. After importing your keys I’d recommend sending your funds to a new address, in case your keys somehow were compromised in the process.
If your uncomfortable seek advice/assistance from someone you know or the community. Gl!

I think people mostly don't spend Bitcoin yet because not a lot of merchants are accepting it, fees are high etc. Infrastructure needs to be built out before using Bitcoin as every\-day currency becomes viable. 
Like I've said, ignoring any cost associated with converting between Bitcoin and fiat, the "hoard Bitcoin, spend other currency" mentality simply doesn't make any sense. When you're spending $100 today you're also spending whatever $100 is worth in Bitcoin. If I hold $10k and 1btc, it won't matter to me what currency I use to buy a $10k car, as long as I can easily convert between the two after the fact. I'd probably use USD simply because most people won't accept Bitcoin.

What's the point of forking it? Why wouldn't you just contribute to the original?
Of the four developers listed as having write access only you seem to exist, and your Github account was created a week ago and includes nothing except this Repo.
The website seems to deliberately be made to look like this is the "original" software. Nowhere do you mention that this is a fork with non-existing developers and presumably lacks massively in QA/testing which is quite important to say the least when dealing with software such as cryptocurrency wallets.
Everything here points to one thing, scam. I'm sorry. If this was supposed to be the real deal it's executed in a way that makes it looks incredibly scammy and thus one questions your capabilities designing such safety-critical software, even if your intentions were indeed good
@_date: 2018-04-30 12:48:11
Yup indeed. Still the arguments stands to show why this kind of thinking doesn't make any sense.
As soon as fiat/crypto conversion will be easier \(by easier I mean cheaper, faster\) then it literally doesn't matter which currency you're using for spending since they're interchangeable. 
But even with relatively high fees, this whole "why spend Bitcoin if it will appreciate in value over time" for arguing why Bitcoin doesn't work as a currency doesn't make any sense. Conversion fees and merchant adoption aside, it literally doesn't matter to me whether I convert half my pay\-check to Bitcoin and keep the other half in fiat for spending or if I convert my whole pay\-check to Bitcoin and simply use Bitcoin for spending.

UX definitely needs to be improved before further adoption will occur. Lightning won't be enough to push further adoption.
It will however make Bitcoin very much so better equipped to handle further adoption. The network in it's current state can't handle a surge of new users as we saw last year. Lightning can enable the increased usage by allowing for higher throughput than 5\-10 tps \- The software will keep maturing and adoption will follow. At this stage we have to accept that Bitcoin simply isn't mature enough to handle being a global currency

While I appreciate the effort, and despise Rogers shady marketing tactics, I think we’re swaying towards the exact kind of biased interpretation of Satoshi’s writings that’s predominent within the BCH community.
Hearn is asking whether the Bitcoin system is a single chain, or a few chains working in parallel to presumably distribute the load on node operators. Satoshi’s merely stating that the former is true, as we all know by now. That’s not to say that BTC and BCH can’t coexist, as they’re not two chains running in parallel within the same ecosystem but rather two different, incompatible coins.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:27:35


This is quite a tricky question to answer.
If you consider only cryptocurrencies that aim to be a payment system and not much more \(ie excluding Ethereum and similar systems for now\), it's arguably quite likely that there will be a single system that remains much larger than the rest, rather than a few similar systems being equally large. Participants will be incentivised to use the largest system, thus growing it even further as new participants enter the scene.
This is called The Network Effect and is further explained here: [
Bitcoin has this advantage today. The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile and speculative at this stage, and real\-world adoption hasn't really picked up yet. As the market matures, along with the software implementations of the different cryptocurrencies, we'll at some point start to see real\-world adoption at a faster rate than we see today. I think that when this happens, when merchants start feeling more comfortable accepting cryptocurrencies as payment and when people start feeling comfortable using cryptocurrencies as their primary means of payment, we will witness the theory of the network effect play out in reality. As a merchant accepting cryptocurrencies, you want to accept the currency that most people have. As a consumer, you want to own the currency which most merchants will accept. It remains to be seen how much of the market share this largest system will claim, but I think it's going to be quite a large portion.
From a more technical perspective, it's very hard to argue that there exists another cryptocurrency that's "better" than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an extremely well designed system, all things considered, and it's not easy to keep it that way when you're talking about systems that are open\-source in the same way that Bitcoin is. As of today, Bitcoin is by far the most secure system, due to the sheer amount of computing power expended by miners which secures it. It's the most mature system out there by quite a margin, and if scalability can be eloquently solved it is arguably ready for mainstream adoption at a global scale. As it turns out, a very exciting technology is in works, that is the Lightning Network, and it is my opinion and that of many others that there is great reason to be optimistic about it's development. Unfortunately it is not ready yet, but then again none of the cryptos are \(ready for global adoption\), and none come close to being as close to being ready as Bitcoin is \(arguably\). If the Bitcoin community succeeds in designing an off chain solution that enables higher transaction throughput, while continuing improvements and optimisations \(those are mostly focused on efficiency and privacy right now, as far as I know\) on the base layer \(on chain\), it will be well on it's way towards getting ready for mainstream usage. Fortunately, all those things are being actively worked on today, and are looking very promising.
But of course it's up to you to do your own research. It's hard to differentiate the good advice from the bad, everyone is incentivised to convince you that "their" coin is the best. If your not very technical \(ie a programmer\) then it can be hard to understand what is really going on except at a very high level. If nothing else, then the aforementioned network effect might be a reason for you to consider investing in Bitcoin, and with it's unmatched track record of withstanding attacks/software bugs/anything that could harm the network, it's hard to imagine Bitcoin going away any time soon. It's arguably the safest bet in the cryptocurrency market, and has pretty good chance of making some extremely high returns on investments for those who get in before adoption occurs. Do note though that this is not financial advice, it's only my view of things, and I'll say it again, I encourage anyone to do their own research before investing in this space.

It's all experimental technology at this point. At the very least Lightning will enable more transactions at a smaller scale \(think a town of some nominal size for example\), and hopefully it will be able to handle pretty much global scale payments efficiently.
It's true that for Lightning to scale the base\-layer needs to be able to support the required opening/closing transactions. Time will tell how much demand this will put on the blockchain, but I imagine the community would be willing to increase the block size accordingly, if the block size was the choking point in what would otherwise be a functioning global payment network.
Lightning is definitely still unproven technology. But most everything within the Cryptocurrency space is, and I've yet to see a better idea for scaling to a global level that what I've seen so far with lightning. In my opinion it is a brilliant idea in theory, hopefully it will work well in practise.

It just looks like a scam that's all. If your a legitimate business I'd imagine you'd want to avoid looking that way at all costs. Anonymous developers that don't seem to exist, a (debatably) misleading website, not being explicit about this being a fork anywhere (github repo isn't forked, doesn't say anywhere on website that it's a fork)
Prove us wrong. Until then I would advice everyone to stay away since we're talking about software that handles your money here. It will probably be confirmed soon enough whether this is indeed a scam.

It´s not pointless of thousands of those payments are made. 
A one-off payment is pointless but I´m pretty sure whoever sent it doesn´t mind losing the $0.00000007 or whatever to demonstrate a cool use case

The systems supply doesn't shrink as the "lost" satoshi would be added to the miner fee. Bitcoin can't be lost by having the total output amount be less than total input amount since the difference is implicitly set as the miners fee
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:45:43
That's true, and the title of the article might be somewhat misleading as it says: "enable smart contracts on Bitcoin blockchain"
Afaik there is no added functionality with MAST, only optimization, improved privacy and groundwork for further development/improvements.
But we really don't want Ethereum-like smart contracts possible on our base layer anyway.

I'm not sure what you mean.
Lets assume a payment channel between Alice and Bob where they both commit 10 satoshi each initially.
Lets say they transact by sending millisatoshi between each other repeatedly. At some point they decide to close the channel, and the state of the channel is such that Alice is entitled 11.5 satoshi and Bob is entitled 8.5 satoshi. Since the blockchain doesn't recognise units smaller than a whole satoshi, their balance gets rounded down to 11 and 8 satoshi respectively. One satoshi gets added to the miners fee and now all whole 20 satoshi that the channel was originally funded with have been accounted for.

Would there be any reason to worry about your channel peers colluding against you? They could all agree to cheat you, with each of them benefitting directly. I guess they’d have to be aware of everyone you have a channel with which I don’t know if is possible, and you’d also have to pick your channel peers pretty poorly to have them all agree to cheat you, but I’m just wondering about the issues of having watchers have an incentive to cheat you themselves.
Obviously this would also work worse as you’d have fewer channels open, to the point of providing no security with only a single open channel. But presumably other nodes could be enlisted as watchtowers as well.
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:47:31
No way this is the actual code though is it?
Anyway I'd be interested in seeing what the software actually looks like. Presumably they pre-define the keys you're given or generate keys and send them to their server.
I wonder if any security/malware guys have rev-engineered it

There's no reason why channels would only be filled with a few cents. Obviously that would be highly inefficient, probably the reason why you're seeing a lot of really small channels right now is because developers/people are testing the LN and there's really no reason to use higher amounts for testing

Why would anyone use fiat to purchase things, instead of purchasing bitcoin, when the price is speculated to increase seemingly forever?
Edit: the only factor here is the hassle required for bitcoin-fiat trading. Spending bitcoin is essentially no different to spending fiat provided that you can easily convert (trade) between the two

The network can only process so many transactions at a time (roughly 5-10 transactions per second). As soon as attempted transactions per second exceed that level, miners will start to pick and choose which transactions to process. They do so by picking those transactions that are most lucrative to them, that is include the highest miners fee. Thus fee rises as people compete to have their transactions processed by offering to pay higher fees.
Note that you can completely control the fee you choose to pay for a transaction, it’s not decided by the system. But when the transaction mempool is filled (lots of people transacting), your transactions won’t be processed unless you set your fees high enough.
It is a classic case of supply and demand

Presumably MAST will enable us to do more complex locking scripts, thus any estimations on how much it reduces tx size don't tell the whole story. How much it reduces tx size depends on the transaction, an average could be estimated but that neglects the fact that with MAST we will start doing even more complex scripts, that is, the "average" transaction will change.
Afaik MAST goes far beyond simply "reducing the tx size by 20%" or whatever % it is. It would be more accurate to say it "reduces tx size by 20%, WHILE allowing more complex scripts", as well as all privacy enhancements and enabling for further development (I think stuff like Taproot depends on MAST being implemented)
The one thing that I haven't wrapped my head around, and notabene I'm quite new to bitcoin development, is the size of the locking script itself. MAST allows us to only publish what's necessary of the redeem script, but afaik it has no effect on the locking script itself? So given very complex conditions, won't the locking script remain large, and grow as the conditions get more complex? 
Or is the locking script always hashed when transactions are constructed? As I'm writing this I feel like that's the case, but I'm not certain.

Unfortunately I agree with you. I couldn’t really follow him either, decided to post it anyway because well he is the lead dev doing the LND implementation.
I wish someone would do a transcript of his videos because he’s a truly bright mind, it’s unfortunate that he’s so hard to listen to
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:32:29
You're getting confused. The on-chain transactions are never dealing with units less than 1 satoshi. You could imagine that as the Users balance gets rounded down to the nearest satoshi, the miners fee gets rounded up to the nearest satoshi as a result

There will most likely be ways to reduce the amount of on-chain transactions needed for LN to function. I think  said once that 100’s of payment channels could conceivably be opened with a single on-chain transaction, altho I don’t remember the context in which he mentioned it.
Here is a stackoverflow thread on something called Channel Factories which seems to be one way to address this problem: 
I’ll admit I’ll have to read it over a few more times before really understanding it. The main point is that everyone is well aware of these issues, and they will be accounted for one way or another. The block size will increase before we allow fully functioning off-chain solutions to be severly degraded in functionality due to the base layer.

[ \- Can anyone clarify what CZ means? I don't understand how they'd revert the transactions without reorging the whole chain, assuming that the hackers have already moved the coins and that those transactions have been included in a mined block
EDIT: I'm pretty sure he meant to say "construct blocks/a chain" and not "construct a TX", and that his plan was to have the miners mine identical blocks except replacing the transactions the hackers made with transactions which pay the 7000btc to miners
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:16:00
Yes, that's basically what I said in my edited post
