There is definitely enough data.  See my other posts for more information, but modern stylometry has come a long way in the last few years.

10,000 characters is roughly ten times the amount of text required for a reasonable analysis.  In fact, we were able to break the text into 10 separate sections and perform our analysis multiple times, which helps to increase our confidence in the overall result.  The article was surprisingly accurate for a news piece, but please note that we are very careful about exactly what we can say here: namely that Dorian is probably not the author of the bitcoin paper, and that of the experts mentioned in the article, Neal King's writing is the closest match to that of the paper.  But that doesn't mean we know who Satoshi Nakamoto is, just who he (probably) isn't.

Thank you for this.  The state-of-the-art in stylometry has gotten to the point where it closely approximates magic.  From a very small sample of text (1,000 characters is best, but we have reasonable results down to 40 characters), we can make very educated guesses at things like: authorship, Myers-Briggs personality type, gender, education level, native language, MIDAS personality information, self esteem, etc.  Many of these techniques have been published in peer-reviewed sources, and the rest are in production for such publication.  It is truly a fascinating field.

If you are a fellow researcher in stylometry, I would love to speak with you offline in more depth about this, if you are interested. 
40 characters is not enough for this type of analysis. I have spent several years researching (and publishing on) micro document analysis. In this case, 40 characters was sufficient for our active authentication project (basically, identifying a computer user based on their keyboard activity), but admittedly we required multiple 40-character chunks to make this analysis (each sample yielded about a 25% accuracy rate across 80 candidate users). 
In the case of the Bitcoin experiment, we had plenty of data. If there is another expert who has specifically studied sample size effects in stylometry, please get in touch so we can coordinate a new study together.

Hello all.  I am the analyst mentioned in the article (John Noecker Jr).  Just peeking in to address a few small things.  The science behind the analysis is sound and supported by years of extensive research (and the accompanying peer-reviewed publications).  There is absolutely plenty of data.  Our techniques are generally most effective with at least 1,000 characters of data, but have been tested with reasonable accuracy (unpublished results of around 25% accuracy on a corpus of 250 authors) with as little as 40 characters (about 8 words).  Obviously, at the low end of the scale, we are really pushing the boundaries.  The article has been updated with a better  (if somewhat overly snarky) explanation in response to Ms. Matthews' criticisms.

The police lineup quote was my esteemed colleague, Dr. Patrick Juola.  It may be a poor comparison, but we need to be very careful how we phrase our results, lest they be misconstrued.  The Unabomber thing was all me though (and I'm rather proud of that particular analogy).

In fairness, the corpus we were working with was not ideal.  For Neal King, our data consisted primarily of reviews on Amazon.  We are very conservative in releasing results, which is why I never published anything last year when I ran the initial experiment.  In this case, the analysis was so conclusive that even with a "bad" corpus, we can be fairly confident that Dorian is not the writer we're looking for.

One of my colleagues, Michael Ryan, is currently working on this very question (whether "Satoshi" is more than a single person).  He has extensive experience in authorship diarization, and I expect he will have some good leads for us in the next few days.

Sorry to disappoint.  This is something we are actively working on, and you can expect to hear something about it in the next few days.  Sadly, that something may well be "I don't know".  We were lucky in that the Dorian analysis was unusually straightforward.  I am generally reluctant to release anything that is less cut-and-dry.
