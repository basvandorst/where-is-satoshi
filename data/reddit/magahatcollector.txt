Using 300k as a pretty commonly acknowledged level to be reached by 2024, about 1.5 imo.
After it reaches 300k... who knows. Maybe a different crypto will take over. But I think bitcoin will dominate the next 5 years.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:44:27
I think guessing is fine for now as long as you’re as honest as you can be.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:44:00
Get ready for a crash
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:26:51
This isn’t real right?

@_date: 2019-07-11 16:02:06
3 paragraphs or less please. No bullshit!
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:35:48
Ok but a whale can change that at anytime so it’s nearly irrelevant
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:49:21
Looks like if anything it predicts a reasonably sized bearish period almost everytime for a few months.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:02:21
I think so
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:03:42
Time to drop to 7k
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:55:06
Ok. But that doesn’t help us. Lol
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:46:26
There are a ton of bad ones tho.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:14:50
Lmao it just dropped 700$ I don’t care about shitcoins cuz I own 0
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:48:57
Lmao you didn’t read the article. The cunt was completely biased af politically and pretended it was fact. You’re a dipshit and you clearly didn’t even read the article.
Also outraged? Hardly. I just was trying to save people some time from reading this idiots article. Completely went off the rails at the end.  Also, and man who doesn’t like trump is a cuck. Including you. Good day!
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:57:53
Um no. Shit meme. Time to go lower.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:39:58
It’s not unlikely.  If we go to 41000 I’ll laugh my ass off at you specifically tho.
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:40:53
Bye bye 10k hello 7!
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:03:04
Been saying it awhile. Now everyone agrees lol
@_date: 2019-07-28 06:51:15
Ok. But do I get to put my losses from 2018 on my tax form?
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:16:26
you bought ripple? Lol!
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:47:12
I’m for both. Both can coexist. I see this as bullish. Everybody has to acknowledge it now.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:25:21
He has no girls, that’s why he’s asking.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:57:19
Lol ok then
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:50:18
Nobody can see the future. Stay humble.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:31:13
Not a fully idiotic guess. But I think your numbers are off. We hit 50k and then the government realizes how much of a threat it is. 80k is when the trouble comes.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:31:40
And cheaper...
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:55:32
Downvote this post please
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:31:57
We are on the brink of a dive to 7500. And maybe since it’s bitcoin we rise above 13 but probably not bro. I think value will come back at about 6800 or so. Until then I find it hard to believe we go higher.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:27:56
They’re working and watching Netflix.
@_date: 2019-07-25 04:41:57
I’m predicting 3k by 2020. But after it bottoms 300,000 in less than 3 years.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:25:32
Been saying sell for two months. Anybody who thinks it’s not testing 6k now is smoking meth.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:40:05
That’s a good attitude to have. Then you won’t panic on large swings.
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:36:47
Uh oh looks like I’m right ��
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:12:13
Holy fuck I’m definitely not buying yet.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:40:09
I’d wait: maybe I’m wrong tho.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:53:59
Part of me wants him to be president so that I have an extra 1000 a month to invest lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:56:07
Totally agree. I sold most at 10k from 3.6k.
I’m feeling a 7k reconstruction of this bull market. Stupid chasers making it go to 14k ruined the solid growth. 
I hope we’re wrong (not really, fuck these chasers). I’ll be ready to buy mine back at 7.2k.
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:42:56
Because each and every one of them is bitcoins bitch. XRP is the bottom bitch hahahha��
@_date: 2019-07-27 20:05:00
Saying it out loud for all to see. Predicting under 3k this year. Watch out below! That will be the last time it’s easy to buy full coins. I recommend you buy 3-6 then!
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:56:05
Lol I hope BTC goes to 2k. Then we’ll see who’s in the 99%.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:25:24
Lol actually a good response! Surprising!
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:18:33
Another one bites the dust....
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:35:44
Lmao nah man. People need to see adoption
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:16:06
Spoke too soon bro. Spoke too soon.
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:52:28
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:45:36
Not if the price is falling dummy. Then you want to stack cash. So that you can stack sats later. But this meme isn’t timed properly.
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:02:05
Lol this guy made a decent article then ruins it by talking about Trump at the end. Concentration camps on the border. Never heard of concentration camps with people banging on the doors to get into them. Fucking idiot.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:03:15
14k was for the birds. Anyone buying above 10 for the first time deserves a little anal.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:17:36
Because we rose too fast. Gotta calm down before a big rise again
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:14:50
Pretty simple. In order for Bitcoin to be worth mining the price needs to rise. The halving does the heavy lifting in this sense. It will happen, just a matter of time.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:52:07
For people like you I recommended leaving all your bitcoin on the exchange lol
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:22:04
Below 10k isn’t a big deal? You’re serious? Ok.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:12:23
I sold 8900 and I tripled up damn near. I’ll be buying yours when you panic sell at 6.2k
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:42:41
Ok I highly doubt bitcoin would have a problem peeing on front of anyone
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:38:04
True. But his show is still the most accurate live news show available. I’m smart enough to read past his zionist tendencies and his tip toeing around the PC laws of the day to see what’s going on.
@_date: 2019-08-03 00:16:21
Lol bens show is great I know you’ve never watched it all the way through before.
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:32:37
The point is to stack sats tho. Not timing the market could cost you hundred grand or more later on.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:09:20
One word. Deflation.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:54
This is best meme
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:35:54
Ok so I know for a fact we are going to 6k now.
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:31:22
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:12:45
Yea I went “half in” at 3.6k. Wish now It was all but meh I was prepared for 2k bitcoin too that way.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:07:40
Seems overbought short term.... maybe a sell off to 8200?
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:06:16
Ding ding we have a winner
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:31:49
Constantly adapting. That’s the game. Don’t try to predict. Watch RSI, and take profits when you’re super excited emotionally. I’m blowing out HODLers this last 6 months trading based on my own emotions. Stepping back, and selling when I’m dancing to my favorite songs, and buying when I’m scared to buy. It’s hard but possible. And boy is it fun...
@_date: 2019-06-11 05:10:31
If this is real we’re gonna see the most insane bull run of our lives.

Also. Bookmarking your name so I can sell when you buy in the future.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:50:14
I did check my posts. Warning big time above 11k haha
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:23:09
Insanity. I think it’s a blow off top soon tho.
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:00:57
I am 1/3 cash. Always hodl at least half just in case it skyrocketed without warning.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:07:15
Accumulate on the swings in bitcoin. If these million dollar price targets come true, every little bit of accumulation is 10x-100x whatever I is now.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:48:49
Basically but I’m still bearish atm. Too many dumbos buying at year highs like we’re never gonna go below 10k ever again.
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:33:27
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbbb
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:59:33
6k. People waiting for lower than that are greedy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:05:36

@_date: 2019-06-16 19:47:15

@_date: 2019-06-26 01:16:16
We’re pretty stretched. Could hit 13.3 tho.
@_date: 2019-06-03 10:19:14
Doing the same.... bought at 3600 and sold at 8200.... not too bad. Waiting for a dip below 7k to buyback in.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:57:20
Lol cocky right now? Yikes.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:31:21
Pretty much. Sheep buying now if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:38:16
Hahahahha good job whale whoever shat on this post
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:30:31
Ok so probably if we hit 10k we will go sideways for 4 months then run?! ;)
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:59:48
Rebuy at 6k we going to 12k soon after ;6)
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:01:22
I’m not that optimistic. I think 40-50k then back to 10 or lower.
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:05:57
Lol HODL for a year and you’ll be rich. Give up bie and you’ll cry. FYI we will be making a pit stop at 6k next month.
@_date: 2019-06-09 22:46:47
I hear you, I think it’s clear to bet it’s going to at least 6400. Just my opinion y’all. I get 2.5k to invest in 6 days.... don’t let my buy your bitcoin! Hahahahah
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:36:32
Way better chance it dips below then doesn’t. But it might never again. That’s BtC for ya
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:31:41
His fucking glasses are so tilted lol
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:53:51
I’d short from above 12k
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:44:27
I think this is pretty accurate actually.

Yes but, people are still a tad sour from the year+ bear market. Lotta people still in red.
@_date: 2019-06-18 03:27:01
Doubtful. even with full fomo I think 200k is the most we could runto because history shows us the corrections are always huge too. We gotta come back below 10k after mooning.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:43:35
Not for long
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:15:01

Don’t sell it. Early 2000s Les Paul’s are some of the best.
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:37:11
Ok 5 coins. I don’t buy they’ll go lower than that.

How I want to do this too
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:00:09
I do think everyone is bullish now after today. Means correction. Might not happen until we hit 13.35k
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:30:20
Can you at least say what you sell?
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:41:54
Here’s the comment I was looking for lol.
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:10:31
To me it’s gold that has capabilities to go into the 4th dimension, effectively. Gold that you can carry around, that has no weight. Gold that can never be stolen. Gold that can fly at 1000s if miles per hour, if it needs to.  It’s incredible, incredible gold.

I see a parabolic move from 3200 coming to a point where it has to fail soon.... could be out of bitcoin hopeful tho cuz I sold at 9k

@_date: 2019-06-27 19:17:32
You’re right to cringe a bit but the reality is this is the last dip to load on. As soon as we hit 50k, it’s unlikely we ever dip below 10k again. And nobody wants to buy a whole coin for more than 10k, even millionaires. But they will. At 50-100k the millionaires will buy in.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:58:49
So rich guys are paying each other with bitcoin when they lose their bets?
@_date: 2019-06-08 19:52:20

I think it’s probably growing pains. The start up crew might not be experienced enough to keep up with the epic growth? Just a guess.

He might be right. Can’t go straight up.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:21:04
Honestly get good at trading. At the end of the day people are interested in making $ for now; I think holding could work long term but short term people want bold callers on when to buy and sell. Everything revolves around bitcoin so there is little point to do anything else for now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:35:04
I’m shooting for 9.5k
Really don’t feel it’s too greedy but I’ll be so sad if I don’t get the buy.

@_date: 2019-06-15 07:32:18
Possibly... based on the RSI tho I’m thinking a double top at 9k might happen. That would be pretty bearish for a short to midterm time frame.... I’m in the “pullback to 6k” group so maybe I’m just seeing what I want to see tho.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:40:11
You might be right. Might.

Fall to 4K, so I can buy a full coin there then back to 10k
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:02:43
Doesn’t mean I’m wrong yet. If it’s above 12k later today I could still be right. By next week we’ll know��

My opinion is do lump sum investing. If you fancy yourself a smart lad. I did this recently. Making 10$ an hour, saved up 3.5k and received a little extra money over Christmas, invested 4.5k at bitcoin=3.6k, and just sold 9.2k in pure profit recently, cutting back my holdings waiting for a pullback and buying a reward dream guitar with my pure profits (4.5k is my remaining stack, same as when I started) I expect a pullback. And will be investing 3k again or close to that on a pullback to below 7k. 6800 is a rough entry. Imo you could copy my strategy. Save up while you wait for it to drop. But be prepared. Have cash ready in your coinbase account. Flash crashes are usually the best time to buy. As was the one from 6 to 3k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:20:51
Heheheh you mad bro? I get paid soon so I’m happy af
@_date: 2019-06-10 01:21:02
4K could be a higher low, but yea I hope it just bounces off 6k personally. Then to 40k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:22:07
I mean I suppose if you have a couple other Les Paul’s. But if it’s your only Les don’t sell.
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:49:23

@_date: 2019-06-14 17:02:32
Eh I doubt it’ll be people with less than 10 coins
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:40:28
I’d say about 10 mil is whales at least of the 17 out, with about 2-3 mil missing.

The dark web. Bought 12 bitcoin to purchase an eighth of coke. Best coke I’ve ever done. However, I had a short discussion with the guy that helped so it with me that it could skyrocket in price.

You think humans will be extinct in less than 100 years? Holy shit.
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:34:07
Good lookin out. I’ll be sure to watch out for that sneaky play.

Women can not grasp that the world we live in may change quickly and so they aren’t preparing for it. Why would they, the current system is designed to help them every step of the way.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:39:15
Didn’t you give me 100 sats the other day? So I’m in the first 8000?
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:30:08
Haha young Jedi, you have much to learn, yet.
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:37:08
That’s why I’m predicting a pullback.... for now tho WEEEEE
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:05:57
Could be a fake out. No worries anyway the alts were miss behaving and gaining on us. This will shake them loose.
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:56:21
Of course. But the fact that I rode from 3.6k to 500 would allow me to sleep at night.

Downloaded it setting up LN wallet
Says I need a bitcoin wallet first.... making one of those too. Do I want an hd segwit or regular
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:02:35
Technical analysis is only somewhat useful in the stock market, and even less so in crypto. Although it should be a factor in your decision making, imo.
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:27:12
It is but we have to start climbing past 6k pretty much now or next month
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:28:45
Lol I’ve been calling for a downturn short term for a few weeks. It’s not going below 6k tho so yea.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:20:44
Hahah this guy has a point hahahahha
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:22:54
Personally, I think this is the biggest hurdle so I’m looking forward to something like coinbase were it’s maybe not the best but it’s easy to use and get started for wallets.
@_date: 2019-05-03 05:41:51
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:24:01
Sold 1/12 just now..... too fast too quick? Either way I’ll buy a few steaks.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:34:23
I like to trade swings and shave satoshi consistantly.... have to get to 12 bitcoin somehow.

@_date: 2019-05-17 00:31:40
Gave up micro transactions
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:19:44
Gotcha. Sounds like a fun wallet to put 50 dollars into.
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:04:32
I’m sensing too much confidence... just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:34:54
I hope down, personally. Just sold some feeling a pullback. Maybe I’m an idiot but it seems hyped atm.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:47:36
Leave that money in until we hit 9500 dummy
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:38:22
Me right now
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:06:29
You should hold and do more research
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:34:15
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:58:39
Omg dude yes! You’re a rockstar brother. Or sister haha.
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:57:29
You the real hero bro.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:26:11
Smart man. Beauty about bitcoin at these levels is it almost doesn’t matter!!
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:55:02
Smoking weed is good tho!
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:45:50
Just sold for a gaining in sats at 8000.... so far sexy move.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:11:35
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:07:47
A hedge
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:27:56
Try it
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:27:39
Yea the how much you own rule will be important then.
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:59:00
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:00:46
Every millennial should own a bitcoin. I know I do ;) $$$$$$$$$$$
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:03:51
Yea as the price rises the risk increases. The guy that sells at 500k is locking in gains during the lowest risk period aka the true genius. Tbh the ultimate genius will sell half at 500k and never sell the other half.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:33:06
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:53:20
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:51:38
Ok cool I won’t make the bitcoin wallet.... got it
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:16:34
Sick dude thanks
I like the layout.
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:09:50
You’re screwed bro
@_date: 2019-05-10 11:39:18
It just seems like enough to where you could sell and never regret it
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:19:13
I predict 6800 minimum. Quite possibly lower... I’d think 5,600 should hold.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:06:22
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:15:55
Thanks for the tips, mr futureman sir
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:18:03
Hahahahha wrong side of history you stupid shorters
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:41:46
Seriously guys... are you guys buying tons of bitcoin at 8k? 5 months ago this was 3.15k.... it’s got to come down to 6-6.5kish before I buy more. I’m pretty sure we’re in for a drop today.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:13:32
Explain further why it would make stores of value irrelevant please.
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:17:37
I’m predicting downturn to 6400.... personally I’m not looking to buy at 8000 gotta imagine people want lower prices to get in. I say we let them. I’ll be buying more in a few months.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:20:07
Quite frankly. It never should have fallen below 6000 in the first place. We’re really 2000 above the bottom. That’s how it *feels* and that’s all that really matters.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:56:43
It’s starting to worry me a little... feeling a rug pull possibly if we fail breaking today or tomorrow.
Nothing crazy. Maybe a pull back to 6500
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:36:18
I’m also thinking about how to cold storage my bitcoin.... sorry I can’t help but I will reference your post for how to do it when someone more knowledgable lays it out for you.
@_date: 2019-05-23 03:45:47
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:17:40
Amen! Praise the god coin!
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:55:50
Not if I do it first!

Any nerves yet?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:15:43
Eventually I’ll be right tho too lol
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:00:10

@_date: 2019-05-14 00:11:40
