Hmm this proposal sounds interesting
@_date: 2015-12-30 04:31:43
I think quite a lot of actors have said that it is not an option for them.
@_date: 2014-08-24 05:02:56
Yes I agree. It has been very useful to me the last year even though the price has been volatile and we're in the very early stage of adoption
@_date: 2014-08-23 06:58:01
Use blockchain for small amounts and paper wallets for large amounts
@_date: 2014-09-11 20:54:59
The thing is quite a lot of bitcoin transactions are actually off the blockchain
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:29:31
I guess you could also make two accounts on local bitcoins and sell it to yourself?
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:51:09
Yeah. . . umm. . . about the weather. . . it is quite nice today, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-04-08 09:42:08
Yep, and the interface is very nice -- you can choose how many signatures you want to approve the funds by adjusting a slide.
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:05:05
I tried to login and can't. The login page wouldn't load at all.
@_date: 2014-08-15 09:18:31
I got mine yesterday. IP was not from NY though. It is better prices (and no fees) compared to coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:23:06
Oh cool thanks you guys!
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:37:49
I installed it but I didn't use it to save any of my private cold addresses. I just scanned in the public addresses for my cold storage so I could keep track of how many coins I had in there. :-)
@_date: 2014-08-21 08:27:06
Wow, nice!!
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:53:40
I like that you're using a throw away account to reply :-)
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:10:14
No I didn't reboot into a separate OS at all. You're right. I've heard Mac can have viruses even though I've never seen one personally.
I live in a part of the world where it's hard to get cheap old computer hardware -- otherwise I would get a 20$ old laptop. 
Maybe I should at least get a usb stick and install Tails on that and use that when I generate the new addresses to be extra safe.
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:29:37
wow originally the beta was supposed to come out end of june. rather disappointing :( videogames can wait I think 
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:56:57
my thought exactly -- till i can get payed in bitcoins directly
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:18:24
I actually feel sorry for these people who think that the best way to buy bitcoin is through investment companies.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:58:22
Exactly. If the merchant (or the payment processor) is listening to the network they can detect any double spends pretty easily.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:14:16
any suggestions?
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:38:19
Would you be able to get it listed on amazon?
@_date: 2014-04-23 05:52:02
Very cool!
@_date: 2014-08-02 10:22:09
Oh really? I've downloaded it and have started using it :(
@_date: 2014-04-16 07:38:05
Yes, I also would be very interested in it!
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:22:57
I never re-use an address after ive imported it into a live wallet. And I sweep all the funds whenever I import it "
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:12:24
Yes, Thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-07 09:52:03
or Mac
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:38:45
Yes I would agree with this.
@_date: 2014-01-01 12:20:02
Ah thank you so much! That's exactly what I wanted.
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:52:52
I dont care if the price goes up or not much myself. I would prefer if it went down actually. 
The value of butcoin and how the naming will effect the price is curious and interesting thing to discuss though
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:07:40
The aml stuff is rather discouraging but I guess the more people who have bitcoins the best -- they can give them to other people in return for services (or do blackmarket trading) without asking for aml info.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:56:53
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:32:47
I tried this in the Istanbul Turkey airport starbucks and it didnt work sadly :-(
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:41:39
Are the secret keys and addresses encrypted? What kind of algorithm is used?
@_date: 2014-08-10 05:39:21
1% for withdrawals is way too much :-(
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:02:41
What about viruses or malware carried by the USB disk to the offline computer? I'd think a linux would be much much safer.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:36:16
Wow really nice! im looking forward to this
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:56:31
it's kind of expensive though, they say :(
@_date: 2014-08-24 07:12:18
Good question. I would really like one too.
@_date: 2014-08-24 05:05:14
I would be overjoyed if this gets implemented into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-02 10:46:12
True I have my cold storage keys in a True Crypt container. . . but I keep the password for my True Crypt container in 1Password. I wonder if I should delete 1Password from my computer as it's not open source and put all my logins (including the password for the true crypt container_ in mitro.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:53:22
Egifter still works it seems
@_date: 2014-08-15 09:25:07
There was already a funding campaign and you guys raised $52,000. Wasn't that raised on the promise of having a fully functional dark wallet by the time the funds were finished?
@_date: 2014-01-01 14:36:46
haha no it won't be
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:40:20
Contacted them :-)
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:41:13
I get google alerts about bitcoin and there's no problem at all. They might just be trying to protect you from bitcoin stealing spam.
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:37:09
Yes, definitely!!
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:53:30
I'm sure this is a noob question but what does ELI5 mean?
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:50:05
maybe because it can be all done on a mobile and without giving the private keys of your bitcoin to a central party. Also any communications with the buyer or seller is automatically encrypted.
@_date: 2014-08-04 07:40:31
It would be lovely if there was a Mycelium Local Trader for Iphone.
@_date: 2014-08-14 21:21:09
Their 1.75% fee gives bitcoin (a little bit) of a run for it's money. Some of the atms and exchanges offer bitcoin for extremely high fees. . . so hopefully this puts some pressure on those businesses.
@_date: 2014-05-20 10:14:04
This is their address -- 16XnkRpTdiey4ixHDXScAu3zF1HLJNEfVo
I scanned it with a qr code reader from the picture.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:46:28
Yeah me too!
@_date: 2014-08-02 10:36:20
It doesn't look like there is very much work on it the last month though :(
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:34:11
It doesnt work for me on facebook :(
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:31:15
I would love support for stealth addresses
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:19:07
I irretrievably lost 0.1 coin myself. . . so we know there is at lest 2,099,999.99 coins to go around for the rest of us.
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:35:52
Yeah the last stable release I have is 7.1a as well.
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:12:10
GABI (beginning of September), Dark Wallet (end of December), Storj (not sure what the date of this is)
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:40:10
Why can't people who have already used instant buy several times without any incident be allowed to keep that feature?? Obviously those people are not fraudulent users.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:50:42
Thanks for posting it! 
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:33:11
I really support the change and wish other bitcoin publications (Coindesk etc) and companies would change as well.
@_date: 2014-08-22 18:46:00
Use Circle
@_date: 2014-04-18 09:17:57
thank you . that's what i was wondering. I think dark wallet also uses 128.
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:38:20
I keep 100% of my savings in bitcoin since last September. Way to go bro!
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:31:05
What does "long bitcoin" mean?
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:53:18
They should do it the way Open Whisper Systems is done -- people get donated bitcoin for any merged pull request.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:40:47
You said you needed 50k to finish development and testing so many of us assumed when we supported you then that we'd have a stable release we can actually use with bitcoins (and not just test coins) with that money. You raised more money (around 2k more) than you had originally set as a funding goal.
Besides only being safe for test coins you write on the wiki for the alpha release:


I'm not sure how this counts as fully functional.  And I'm not convinced you'll do the work with an extra $24,000. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 08:06:37
Probably depends on how enthusiastic they are. I put pretty much any money I don't need this month into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:37:45
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:13:42
Everybody was doing that before computers came along.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:52:45
It seems like it's free (just the normal miner's fee)
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:07:21
Ah, thank you for commenting. :-)
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:00:28
Is it coming to Istanbul?
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:52:54
I think Israel has the most bitcoin startups per population compared to any other country and their meetups are also huge. Bitcoin is a fusion of technology and finance -- both two things Israelis are good at.
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:04:05
I have exactly the same question.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:03:42
Another question -- I've heard that the chat is peer-to-peer but it also seems to be based of cryptocat library (which isn't peer-to-peer).
Is it peer-to-peer and encrypted now? Or only just encrypted?
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:46:20
11/3/13 :( Still no invite.
@_date: 2014-08-23 11:55:46
Great for bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:07:54
Coinbase says they're not going to change unless the price really goes up.
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:10:22
Is there any means for members of the bitcoin industry to comment and inform the European Court of Justice?
@_date: 2014-08-09 08:39:48
I think chances are tho that its more likely it's by a rogue cia or nsa agent than an official project.
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:49:19
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:18:51
Ah Thank you! Has anyone tried 
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:29:29
Great idea!
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:06:00
Wow this is so nice!!
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:46:17
Me too
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:47:44
my parents were also a bit concerned when i bought in around 110-130 early last fall. . .  it felt quite nice to tell them how much money I had when it increased by more than five times in the next few months.
I didn't sell at it's peak and one of my friends was trying to tell me how silly it was that I didn't -- but I don't really want the stress, and I figure I'll do better long term just buying and holding instead of trying to time the market.
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:45:32
What is DFW Trading Group? Do you mean DRW Trading Group?
@_date: 2014-09-08 00:09:15
Wow this should get forwarded to their lawyers
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:00:09
Circle is pretty instant (for amounts under 500$)
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:48:01
yes this is a big problem imho
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:17:43
O I would love to have multisig! Hopefully you guys are with blockchain :-)
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:55:07
I used to keep mine in sets of 5BTC when 5BTC was around $600 -- now it's a lot more of course, and I'm wondering if I should split them up. Definitely any new bitcoin I'm getting I'm only putting one bitcoin or so per address.
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:06:12
I'm holding and trying to buy some more.
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:08:44
You can very easily with Circle. :-)
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:33:08
Cool. But do you have to sell it for LTC? Regardless if you deposit money into BTC-E and wait a day or so the BTC you withdraw will be different coins, right?
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:07:40
This is very important
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:42:44
It should be fine to keep using it. Just make sure you keep the original program. (And don't use their new 7.2 version unless it's totally verified that it's legit. . .and even then I don't know why it would be useful to use.)
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:58:09
Coinbase already has the option of switching to bits.
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:18:01
A yes, please add coinjoin mixing!
@_date: 2014-01-01 18:55:43
It depends what your threat model is -- in general we assume that our physical systems are physically secure, I'd think. If they weren't physically secure you are right, having them all stored in one place isn't a good idea.
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:33:04
I just wish that it worked in the Middle East :(. I tried it in Turkey and it didn't. :(
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:32:23
And stealth addresses!
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:18:41
What is a good open source alternative to TrueCrypt?
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:24:41
Ive donated lots already :-(
@_date: 2014-01-01 14:45:55
Bitcoin is the honeybadger . . . it doesn't care a shit.
@_date: 2014-08-23 16:24:19
@_date: 2014-01-01 10:41:14
Hmm, it's gone up a factor of ten every year but this year 55x.
@_date: 2014-08-14 21:22:23
Really??? I transfer money between countries all the time with bitcoin and most of the time I actually gain a few cents in the remittance process.
@_date: 2014-04-05 19:23:22
And if we dont have a hard limit our hard-earned coins will continue to loose more and more value as more coins are brought into the system.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:20:42
Yes thats what im thinking -- that ill need to pick up that kind of malware. Ive never seen or heard of a mac virus/ malware like that but Im not sure I should count on it not appearing or getting infected with one in the future.
I'll get a dedicated usb flash drive this week and follow your instructions for running it.
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:15:20
What?? I use it to keep my keys encrypted :(
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:48:30
Yes, I get that all the time as well. Nobody wants to buy just part of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-18 09:08:57
cool stuff. I'm thinking I should get casino dice myself kk
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:23:22
They can see where the money went and see that it went to local bitcoins. It doesn't matter if you just used the local bitcoins web wallet and didn't sell a single coin. . It would still look like (to anyone following the money) that you were selling coins this way.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:28:28
Wow, I imagine that will give them a lot of new business!
@_date: 2014-08-17 05:37:39
Why don't you take bitcoin donations?
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:52:18
It's very easy to install. Just don't use it for anything over five dollars or so (I haven't actually deposited any money at all).
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:52:57
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:46:59
I'll buy you a hotdog as well, if you are interested in going there two times. :-)
@_date: 2014-08-24 05:00:10
MIT students get 100$ each. . . Wow, the Dutch are stingy.
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:00:26
Me too! I'm so happy. It's nice not having to worry about the fees for buying and selling bitcoin through coinbase!
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:45:04
yeah storing bitcoins on windows never seemed like a very healthy preposition to me.
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:33:54
That's a great idea and shouldn't be that hard to do.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:22:06
How is the wallet encrypted on my harddrive? Is it pretty secure from viruses, maleware etc?
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:46:55
Volatility isnt a problem at all -- just have them buy "dollar tokens" with bitcoin using bitpay or coinbase and then gamble with those
@_date: 2016-01-01 06:13:24
Foreign use will only continue to grow if the transaction fee stays low. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:50:02
Dark Wallet is hands down the best; even though it's in developement right now you can still use it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:11:21
Good point -- with the price going up so fast I think a bunch of people (like you mentioned) were caught flat-footed. 
I'm confused what Local Bitcon's policy is. A few of my transactions today used less than a cent, but most were way over it.
@_date: 2013-10-05 05:31:17
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:55:08
No surcharge when you pay in bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:17:09
Bitpay is working with quite  a few townships according to their talk at the Amsterdam conference. You should get in touch with them.
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:22:52
Awesome! I really like how international this is
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:16:50
Yes it doesn't matter. Even if we only have 1 bitcoin that will be a billion or so satoshis so people could trade in satoshis or something smaller.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:28:14
Yes Korbit seems quite useful (although rather expensive).
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:49:21
Wow very cool!
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:18:35
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:43:02
Yes I did but it took quite a long time -- I had to have google maps open at some of my old addresses (because I was so young and didn't drive around those addresses and didn't know what the closest street was)
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:44:14
It's very very annoying :(
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:13:46
But even instant doesn't work now.
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:01:18
What kind of secure wallet do you suggest for storing stuff on your own computer?
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:34:36
Wow pretty nice!
@_date: 2013-10-16 06:01:37
Hmm. . . but for bitcoin to really take off it needs to be 10,000 or above I'd think. . . so the sooner we get to a 10,000-100,000 number the better it will be. No need to go slowly I'd think.
Also the more it continues to increase the more people will want to buy bitcoin as a way of saving money -- which isn't bad either.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:55:40
Good for you!!! :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:07:40
I just saw this too and I need to buy!
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:56:15
The same for me -- bitcoin means freedom, liberty, power back in the hand of the small guy, the normal guy and out of the government's hands.
Bitcoin means being able to save money and see the value increase over time and not depreciate. It means being able to work productively and be able to receive real value for the work I've done -- value that can not be debased by government fiat or greed.
Bitcoin means being able to send money to friends or family across countries without having to pay fees or wait long times or answer lots of questions.
Bitcoin means being able to travel and pay for things (hopefully eventually) without having to worry about exchanging money into the local fiat currency.
Bitcoin means new friendship, new comradarie with friends all around the world who share a desire for freedom and peace. Peace because governments will have less of an ability to manipulate currency to fund wars.
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:38:06
Starbucks. I'd love to be able to use it with Starbucks anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:04:01
Yes if the bitcoin progam by default had milibits that would be the best-- people could still talk about bitcoins if they want 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:32:18
Ok, cool. You guys are awesome then!!! :-)
@_date: 2013-10-15 09:59:49
I don't have much but I'm putting 80% or more of my assets in bitcoin (and I haven't been disappointed so far).
@_date: 2013-09-11 16:45:29
the legacy banking system in essence :(
@_date: 2013-10-15 20:11:20
how much of a percentage higher than the going price are you selling them for?
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:14:20
No. I have money in several different currencies and although I way prefer using bitcoin if I have to buy something in another currency I don't mind exchanging it to be able to use it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:06:14
This is so so so so terrible. "Anyone who wants to do business in the US will have to have an address tied to his identity." What??!!
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:58:53
Wow, it's quite nice. Loads of great ideas and startups there.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:26:31
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:54:37
Yeah me too. I was posting about bitcoin all the time on facebook. . . not because I like posting about money or am really interested in money but because I support it ideologically and think it's really cool.
Now that I have so much money, I feel rather embarrassed talking about it. :(
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:09:38
It works for me.
@_date: 2013-09-11 15:54:39
I want one! I'll order today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:28:32
I wonder if there are any restaurants/cafes in Haifa that take bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:28:27
the money seized was just what was in the escrow accounts.
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:59:06
A lot of people don't like the hastle or having to give all their bank information to coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:42:06
Yes me too. This is quite a big problem.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:07:38
The block size problem seems the worst problem to me. Does anyone else have any thoughts on it?
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:51:50
yes, chinese is not that difficult. For instance 一 is 1, 二 is 2, 三 is 3. After that it gets a bit more complicated, but not much.

Why is BTCTurk ( not on that list?

Olaf, I've also had several transactions pending in the last few hours. :(
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:33:02
Shhhhh!! Don't give away thinking-outside-the-box secrets -- they'll be our competitors :)
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:47:06
Wow it's fun to see all the skepticism in the past.
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:29:22
Yes I've also talked to people who did not want to buy coins because they thought it would be too expensive to actually buy a whole coin.
@_date: 2013-10-04 04:18:45
I hate this quote from the article:
“No one can look at the world today and think that bitcoin is the optimal system for processing illicit transactions,” Mr. Murck said.
I don't want to do anything illicit, but we have to work harder to provide anonymous and untrackable system for people to transact in bitcoins -- because whatever people do, illicit or licit should be private.
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:34:27
Or it could restabilize around 1000$ before shooting off to 10k and then again shooting off. . . It's going to continue to appreciate in value for quite a while, if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2013-10-14 23:38:44
Wow. This is big. . really big.
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:44:26
If you are in a country where people want to buy bitcoins you can sell it with a local bank transfer on local bitcoins.
I don't know why you want to sell though -- the price will only go up.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:29:28
Actually they respond much quicker to reddit posts than any support emails. :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:19:36

@_date: 2013-08-31 15:14:04
Why does coinbase have such low limits? And do you know if that will change?
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:11:12
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:22:15
Cool. That's pretty awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:27:22
I don't want to cash out ever.Wait till each coin is very valuable and then just use the coins directly.
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:10:06
Yes, it's good you forgot it. :-)
@_date: 2013-09-11 10:17:01
But normally when you get blocked by other services (like the infamous paypal for instance) I can find out what triggered the block, send in other necessary documents if they are needed, etc. But I guess Western Union doesn't have any system like that? 
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:05:58
Wow nice!
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:15:40
Good, good :-)
@_date: 2013-10-06 08:31:27
True, true
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:38:52
I second that!
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:37:18
I guess we could have offchain chains? 
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:58:12
Wow cool. Is this then now the third American exchange that is in beta/i.e. not working yet?
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:49:31
Hahaha. . It sounds like, "So we can't have them? Well, we actually didn't want them in the first place."
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:42:27
Wow, that works very nicely! Thank you.
@_date: 2013-09-14 21:22:02
You can do a transfer to my credit union and I'll release the bitcoins -- contact me with a pm if you're interested. I'm on local bitcoins and will send you my ad there.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:25:18
mine too!
@_date: 2013-09-01 04:39:11
Which coinbase deposit address were you using? Because coinbase addresses in your account settings are not connected to your coinbase balance. If you sent them to one of those addresses it would not show up in your coinbase wallet account.
For your account addresses coinbase writes:
 "Advanced users may find the list of bitcoin addresses below useful. New bitcoin addresses are automatically generated for each payment on Coinbase and stay associated with your account forever (so it is safe to reuse them).
Address balances are not related to your total account balance, and do not reflect funds held in offline storage."
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:09:25
Ah, thank you for that info. That is still quite a large amount of bitcoin trading going on.
@_date: 2013-10-09 14:17:49
Yes, that was.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:52:55
Oh really? Wow, that's nice then! :-) So if we as consumers want we can use your card but we don't have to?

Gerelt Ireedui offers help for alcoholics in Mongolia (so more central asia than south east asia) 
There's another charity I came across that provides shelter for abused women in the Philippines. I'll try to find their website as well.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:22:41
Netherlands also seems to be rather positive -- 
Denmark has said that it's not a currency which means any exchange would be unregulated.
By the way I really enjoy watching your videos. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-09-29 14:04:36
Wow cool! Thanks so much. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:47:42
Ah, I wish I had 20,000 to put into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:04:07
It's incredibly stupid and totally unheard of.
No, just kidding. :-) One will probably worth an awful lot in the near future. . .and you can always add to it whenever you earn money, putting a little bit in bitcoin as a savings account.
@_date: 2013-09-29 11:12:03
They get results, which I've seen. If other organizations want to help as well then we should support them also. :-) 
I don't really care what they believe in, as long as they do a good job leading people out of alcoholism and supporting the families who are victims of it.
AA in the States also enjoins former alcoholics to seek a higher power so I don't think it's that controversial.

Yes they have. But never for so long :(
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:14:17
I've had a similar problem the last couple days with them.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:34:46
I agree. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:44:48
It says we have 1,5058 users at the moment. . . Isn't it usually like a few hundred?
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:57:27
Yes I agree too -- but it will still be several years till bitcoin gets adopted en masse -- so it will be fun to see my money increase by orders of magnitude until then.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:59:23
Fred, it's giving me the same notice again.
@_date: 2013-09-14 18:01:31
I do this. If everyone did it it would be wonderful.
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:22:00
Wow, thank you. That's very helpful!
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:47:40
Yeah you should have bought a few weeks ago but it won't matter in the long run. I bought some today to add to my collection.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:11:01
Yes, it did. :( I think I lost money because I sold at 100 and now I can only buy it back at over that rate. :(
@_date: 2013-10-29 18:26:38
Yes me too!
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:41:28
Wow, American tipping culture is strange. So they can run after you and demand that you tip them??
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:03:01

@_date: 2013-10-02 19:01:02
And I get the message again.

@_date: 2013-10-15 18:16:31
You guys, we have to go pretty high up for bitcoin to be useful to big companies and richer people to use for money transfers/safe havens and the like. . . so hopefully it goes up quickly.
@_date: 2013-09-12 08:05:51
This is not advice but I don't think buying 100$ of bitcoins and selling them off to friends in school would qualify you as a bonafide money transmitter.
I'm sure lots of people trade more than that (on local bitcoins for instance) without registering at all. That doesn't make it right, but. . . . 
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:12:21
It's a nice guide. I like the style! I felt I had suddenly taken a time machine and gone back in time 20 years.

This is an extremely big problem for bitcoin. I tried last year actually to buy it and couldn't find a good way to get a hold of any. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:30:45
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:13:56
Its 22 minutes and it hasn't changed yet. :(
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:15:17


10x? It will be worth a lot more than 10x eventually. The last four years it has been increasing by ten times every year.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:23:19
Actually bitcoins (or any sound currency) lowers the gap between the rich and the poor. If the rich hoard their money in bitcoins it makes the rest of the bitcoins increase in value. If they spend it, than they spend it on things those who are less wealthy made, and so the wealth gets redistributed that way.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:03:01
Oh good point. There should be an option of uploading your public pgp key to your account and having them send it encrypted.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:44:59
Forty-Six minutes later and still no word from Olaf. I think this has been the longest that coinbase has been out of coins.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:13:27
Let me know what merchants you sign up -- I have a close friend in Columbia who uses bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:59:58
they have a security pin
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:43:10
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:30:46
Oh great! i should have seen this. Thank you for givingg the link
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:55:13
When did you buy most of your bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:11:40
Terrible idea. I don't begrudge them their coins. All the rest of us should make sure our coins are encrypted enough so they can't be seized.
@_date: 2013-08-31 22:05:22
Are you in the States? Use coinbase -- I think they are cheaper than anybody you would find selling coins on paypal. (And it's a lot safer.)
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:07:22
but it's been ages and still nothing has changed :( 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:40:01
No No No :-)
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:20:18
Yes, no I was just wondering if it was possible for wires to be reversed in some cases. (I hope not!)
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:29:41
Yes. I'm interested in anything that uses bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2013-09-01 09:55:46
I'm not sure how you'd access those coins -- I would also be very curious how I would do that or how to get ahold of the private keys for those addresses.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:30:00
Yes I tried this as well and got the same notice.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:47:32
Yes I will. :-)

@_date: 2013-10-03 06:41:46
The sky is falling, the sky is falling! Bitcoin is worthless. Sell them to me for 20$ a piece. I'll buy them and you can recoup your losses somewhat.
@_date: 2013-09-17 04:28:11
I used all six of my votes on this. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:44:01
Yes, true, but I have one transaction that has taken 48 minutes and it still hasn't hit the block yet. (Usually for me it hits the block in a few min at the most)
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:28:04
good answer :-)
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:22:53
I lost 178USD so not the worst thing in the world but still annoying. :( I was almost going to try to sell my paper wallets off but I didn't, thank God.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:11:06
wow pretty cool!
@_date: 2013-10-07 09:42:55

Wow so cool!!!^^
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:49:45
I think we'll hit 300 sometimes this month and probably earlier than later.
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:11:51
no i was also thinking that way
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:44:11
I like it!
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:27:45
Another posibility!
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:36:52
Wow cool
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:58:47
Yes I wish so too -- it seems it has pretty good liquidity.
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:56:12
Is there a way to read it online without coughing up fiat?
@_date: 2013-09-30 05:54:57
What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:54:56
Nope, not in the States.
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:49:34
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:55:24
Wow, where did you get these from?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:32:46
It doesn't matter -- you still only get the coins at the price it is on Friday.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:21:14
You saved my life. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:45:31
More money. I've already run up a bit of credit card debt (even though I really hate debt) so that I can use most of my spare dollars for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:32:33
Actually it's number 4th I think, after BtCE
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:42:24
I read the rest of the story. Can't wait till you write some more.
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:58:58
Wow, they're lucky they have eleven exchanges in China.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:14:24
The news is a bit late -- it's going up now again.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:08:49
This is terrible. Often they can get this taken care of so that people can buy again.
@_date: 2013-09-18 04:56:00
That's the second bitcoin exchange in Turkey that I know about -- the first one (which works really well)  is BTCTurk.com
@_date: 2013-10-10 08:38:48
How do you access the calculator in zero block?
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:37:12
wow very coool :-)
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:01:31
Wow Thank you!! :-)
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:48:03
Wow very cool!
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:05:48
I have a receipt -- local bitcoins keeps very good receipts of all conversations and when the coins were put in escrow and when they were released.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:00:47
Good stuff! And great Cody Wilson got all the funding he needed for the Dark Wallet. :-)
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:41:23
I haven't had any trouble so far with my credit union. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:28:33
You're among company if that is any consolation. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:19:49
It still doesn't work. :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:35:17
Yes, I'm telling too many people too. I have to keep my mouth shut.
@_date: 2013-10-12 15:00:32
Only one? With 600 you can buy much more than one.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:47:11
What about Vault of Satoshi?
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:56:26
Yes, I don't really mind. It's not that much and I'm young and I am not married or have children -- and I have a good job, so even if I loose it all it's not the end of the world. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:22:58
That doesn't seem to help.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:56:07
Definitely. I was wondering why the price has been going up all day. . . it's cool now to know why. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:59:08
This is incredibly important and something that people often don't seem to understand.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:49:18
Or maybe people have Asian girlfriends?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:59:18
Hopefully not :( Did you have to check any box when you bought the coins that you understood it would be at the Friday price?
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:12:52
Good idea. . and Satoshi
@_date: 2013-10-01 17:26:41
Yes I sent something else as well to an external address and it still hasn't been sent out :(
@_date: 2013-10-01 07:10:21
I'm not sure if it wiil effect bitcoin much -- it seems more hype than real shutting down.
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:04:37
Oh no :(
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:22:39
Silkroad was only unique in that it showed what could be done rather easily with the right tools -- encryption, tor, some kind of escrow service and bitcoin. 
The thing with drugs is that there is always a demand. . . does anyone seriously believe anybody kicked their habit because Silk Road went down? . . . and there were always be people who, even if it's risky, want to try to make a profit off that demand.
Like the article says, I'm sure loads of traders and buyers switched already to Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded -- and I"m sure many more market places will spring into place to fill any remaining void before too long. That's the beauty of the free market.
As [DPR said]( " DPR single-handedly won the war on drugs. Period.
It's not just the Silk Road website any more. Copy-cat sites started springing up almost immediately after the first round of publicity when the public found out about the Silk Road Anonymous Market. The technology and ideas that DPR introduced the world to are only getting better, and the underground drug market on the internet isn't underground any more."
@_date: 2013-10-18 12:32:51
Cool! Donations are really ripe for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:19:26
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:02:51
Local Bitcoins is often the best way to go it seems.
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:41:11
I wish coffee shops and cafes all around the world would accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:14:39
Yes, but it definitely provides a different perspective. Of course there are so much more mBTCs in the universe than BTCs so things all even out in the end.
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:12:08
Oh that's a good idea. I think I value my bitcoin too much to give random people dollars. . . but $0.25 is a lot less and I could do that amount.
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:07:31
I was hoping to be able to pay with my smartphone and not carry cash at all. (A lot of places outside the States cash is rather scarce and everyone uses cards already)
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:27:14
They sell us out and yet some people want us to donate to them :( 
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:59:03
I think it's pretty safe. They're based in Finland and have been active for quite a long time (and take security pretty seriously).
Still I would not store coins there that I don't want to trade.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:13:18
I heard somewhere that people were using ringo as an alternative name for mBTC. It has a much nicer ring, I would say (pun not intended). 
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:37:43
How would a decentralized exchange work differently than local bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:01:21
Of course if the price goes up as much as it has this week you loose out by buying just weekly.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:30:28
Local Bitcoins is quite good.
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:01:00
Hmm you could but I don't think it will ever go down to under 120. (It definitely won't on Gox). . . so if I were you I'd buy now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:40:13
That's pretty much what I'm doing and it has been working well. (And I've gained a lot when it appreciates by holding my spare change/paycheck in bitcoin as much as possible.)
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:24:45
People can call it whatever they want imho -- it's a free country after all
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:28:00
No not crazy. :-) Just ahead of the curve.
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:16:07
Haha, it's not a bad question -- and it's obviously on more than few people's minds these days. . . 
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:04:35
That's still way too high imho
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:26:31
There's quite a few other online markets for drugs ala Silk Road. When the price was going down everybody was saying that all those sellers and traders would just dump their bitcoins but it seems not -- they just switched to other providers.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:14:24
or five minutes
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:14:03
Wow great. It's 125.67 on coinbase right now -- which is the highest it's been since it dipped down during the SR shutdown.
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:00:00
Is there a bitcoin address to donate to the Lavabit owner?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:40
Turkey has a very nice exchange -- BTCTurk.com There were some positive news articles about it recently in the Turkish press as well.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:46:31
Wow, this looks pretty cool. I'm definitely going to use it.
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:57:40
Hmm maybe but they should still give a fair price.
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:33:32
Isn't one of the main ideas about bitcoin is that our coins are safe from being seized? If that becomes part of the protocol nobody is theoretically safe from having their private stash declared invalid.
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:14:38
I wish  we had someone who has a website or blog following Chinese online opinion about bitcoin. . . My Chinese is a bit rusty. . .

@_date: 2013-09-29 11:51:25
no, i'm not but would it be a problem if I was? the cool thing about bitcoin is it's useful for anything -- people buying dope or escorts in the States or London or people supporting aid organizations in remote places (like the one i linked). If you don't want to support them, don't bother. I thought it was cool they had incorporated bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:57:27
Why can't you keep dollars in your coinbase account (somewhat like paypal)? Then you should be able to buy and sell instantly.
@_date: 2013-10-04 05:45:07
How do we know this is the fed's address?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:10:26
I hundred percent agree.
@_date: 2013-10-12 14:36:50
There are two nice looking US exchanges -- Kraken and CoinMKT -- but both of them don't really work yet because they're in beta still. I can't wait till they start working. :(
@_date: 2013-09-10 07:51:10
OH this is terrible :( I was just about finished with my 30 days and was so excited I would be able to move bitcoin around much faster.
@_date: 2013-10-09 14:18:09
Ok, I might let you sleep till 1000$ though hehe
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:58:49
To the moon!
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:38:42
I do the same thing -- although I've left five litecoin in BTCE overnight. I should move them to a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:44:39
how can you buy shares of satoshi-dice?
@_date: 2013-09-19 06:23:01
Key thing to note -- keep your main stash of bitcoins encrypted and in several different places 
@_date: 2013-10-02 05:11:30
Wow, cool we should celebrate by taking out by donating to a charity or taking out a spread advertisement in the NY Times/Wall Street Journal.
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:19:34
340 USD (Bitstamp)
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:42:52
where did you get that?
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:47:53
Hopefully soon there will be proper exchanges that one can use without having to try and finagle things with coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:25:51
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:59:50
I love the title :-)
@_date: 2013-10-01 10:01:47
5% seems an awful lot compared to coinbase or bitstamp
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:01:14
Also people (and businesses) have to realize that holding (or saving) their money in bitcoins is a more valid business proposition than converting it to fiat. Otherwise even if the whole supply line uses bitcoin, if bitcoin remains volatile, there will not be enough incentive to keep a decent percentage in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:35:43
Why is Vault of Satoshi not on there?
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:48:06
Coinbase is becoming more and more inconvenient.
@_date: 2013-10-02 05:07:59
Yes but lots of people on local bitcoins still use Gox as a benchmark. Specially buyers seem to do that.
I"m not sure why coindesk doesn't include the local bitcoin price because there's an awful lot of exchange that goes on through that decentralized site.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:31:47


What about the 2.47% fee then? Where does that come in?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:33:31
It will go up eventually -- don't worry. After a few days you'll break even, and then it's up, up, up!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:19:19
It's not official. . . it just takes a lot of capital to get a business like that started.
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:51:14
I have a big head. . . how big are your beanies? Also do you ship overseas?
@_date: 2013-10-06 11:46:54
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:12:39
Yes they are. Be careful :P
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:36:05
Yes it's good. Hopefully we can stop looking to them for any kind of guidance if they aren't going to be letting CNY deposits.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:21:19
So that would be 4.5 Ringos (mB) or 4,500 Toras (µB) right?
@_date: 2013-10-10 11:34:53
I'm not sure what the attraction of the other alt currencies are. Definitely they'll probably be useful, always as _alternative_ currencies though -- bitcoin seems the best value for saving money.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:07:48
 Is there a website address?
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:25:12
Well if you can buy bitcoin easily than you can always buy back whatever bitcoin you used up right away and you don't loose any coins at all.
For me I chunk down all my salary into bitcoins every month and then sell off parts when I have to pay bills or for food (and I can't use the bitcoin directly).
Every dollar you use could also be used to buy bitcoin and that bitcoin could appreciate in value, so it's the same problem whether you are using bitcoin or dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:15:56
Hahahaha. . that advertisement wasn't too long ago -- 7 years ago or so?
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:09:05
Wow pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:57:31
Awesome. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-11 04:14:58
They're a bit late. . . they said it would only be two hours.
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:15:38
One lucky guy. I wish I had bought 24$ worth of bitcoin then. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:07:18
I didn't put all :P Just almost all. . . Come to think of it, it's not even almost all. . . . 'some' I guess is better way to put it.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:51:40
With fractional banking people can hold more money I assume though, right?
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:22:23
Hmm, yes how do we know it's not a scam?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:37:45
Yes it includes that (if you have to check a box saying you understand you are buying at Friday's prices)
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:46:51
Local Bitcoins is probably the fastest and easiest way.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:06:58
Wow thank you so much! :-) I'll send it to her right away. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:03:17
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:51:56
I like the idea of a bitcoin POS. The fees seem quite high though. I'd rather just pay with cash or directly with bitcoin. (Or use a credit card where I get points for how many dollars I use)
@_date: 2013-10-05 06:09:33
here are my thoughts -- posted just a few minutes ago on somewhat similar subject -- 
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:12:32
I support you 200 %. Names that are beautiful are much much nicer than scientific or pedantic names.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:44:14
Where in the Istanbul airport is this? Is this in the AtaTurk airport? If this was recently that's a decent price.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:12:23
Half of mine I panic sold, half I didn't -- does that count?  :(
@_date: 2013-09-14 22:56:55
I tipped some as well. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:41:57
I would argue not. You could say the bitcoins doubled in value or you could say the price of the laptop depreciated.
@_date: 2013-10-13 10:57:07
and then we should also have a 'cash forward' system -- so you can easily change cash into bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:32:34
Me too. My, this was one of the worst articles I've seen in ages about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-30 05:28:09
It's up for me.
@_date: 2013-09-30 08:08:33
ah, it would be nice if it did
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:58:00
Is this legit?
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:51:11
Hmm, I should buy some more before it reaches $1000. I don't really want to be buying bitcoin at that price. :(
@_date: 2013-09-29 13:11:55
Wow cool, thank you! I'm sure they'll really appreciate it! :-)
@_date: 2013-10-01 08:41:35
Local bitcoins seems to be the best way at the moment -- but it would be nice if there were more regular exchanges ala China.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:20:41
I sell with wires and cash deposit often because I thought they were irreversible.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:09:43
Hopefully before then!
@_date: 2013-10-12 17:58:33
Is this worth it?
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:24:30
Nice story!
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:39:21
I really love this idea!
@_date: 2013-10-16 22:29:24
Yes, I was a bit shocked as well about that.
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:09:47
or a macbook pro?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:09:35
Its not down for me.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:23:15
I am trying to as well. :-)
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:05:23
I think the price was artificially low when it was around 99$/100$ earlier this month -- and then after the regulatory meeting went well, it kind of decided it could go up.
If it is going to reach 1000$ by the end of this year (or the beginning of next). . . it can't rise too slowly.
@_date: 2013-09-10 13:17:55
Hey, thank you so much. I'm actually in a country outside of the States and the Western Union agents I've all been talking to say they can't do anything and to just call American customer support (which I did) but then they also say they can't do anything. But I'll keep trying. It's good to hear you don't have any problems. :-) 
(And if I get it worked out I won't try to compete too much. :-) )
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:32:23
I don't know if that will help them though. Selling seems to work fine though.
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:43:20
I say -- compared to all the exchanges except for Gox.
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:43:09
No for one thing ripple's currency is all premined. It might serve as a nice complement to the bitcoin system though.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:01:40
100-130  -- my money has also doubled, which is pretty sweet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:11:24
Lots of places in the world transactions are actually quite cheap (unlike the States). . . so to compete (and also to better enable micropayments) we really need to have much much lower transaction costs.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:59:04
Wow, that's pretty good volume. . . How do you see the charts for Korbit? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:43:07
I hope not. But you might be right.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:34:14
It will hit 2000 before the New Year, I'd wager. :-)
@_date: 2013-10-11 08:37:35
Amazon &amp; Apple Store
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:46:16
I think try to make the point that the government is stealing the rewards of their productivity by diluting the money supply. When you think about it that way, it's obvious that if you are productive and you get rewards for your productivity you want to keep your rewards and not have it secretly debased.
@_date: 2013-09-11 10:20:41
The States hasn't blocked me (they say) but it seems that the country I'm in -- that branch of Western Union has blocked me . . . but there is no customer service for the country I'm in and all the agents here I've talked to (who are all very nice and kind) can't find any reason why I'm blocked either. :(
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:10:48
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:06:53
Yes then you're good.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:29:55
This generates good passwords too: 
@_date: 2013-09-10 10:49:32
thank you for your comment. My payments weren't blocked because they were related to bitcoin. However I did receive several payments the same day (and that seems to have triggered what I assume an automatic trigger to have my payments suspended).
However, I have not been able to find out what exactly is the problem and anything I would have to do to fix it from any customer service person that I called (either the customer service in the country of origin or in the customer service for the receiver country). . . which is quite frustrating. :(
@_date: 2013-11-16 09:31:15
No don't! If you do there will be less for the rest of us.
You can always buy part of one when they're 100,000 a piece, so there's plenty of time. :-)
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:25:00
Yes, I've had the same problem with intermediate banks. No bank seems to be able to tell you how much money the intermediate bank will appropriate for themselves.
@_date: 2013-10-10 19:49:17
wow so sad :(
@_date: 2013-09-12 08:08:22
It's pretty annoying and seems to have gotten worse the last few days.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:37:17
Korean pop. Nice
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:37:46
The western union website (about people who use western union) says: "3. Who uses the Western Union Money TransferSM service?
Anyone who needs to send or receive money quickly and reliably. 
People who support relatives or friends.
Travelers in an emergency.
Business people who need to send or receive money quickly for business.
Someone sending the gift of money." 
So it seems business transactions are ok.
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:24:03
Coinbase confirms right away as soon as you send the transaction to the network.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:38:34
So before any term is in general currency it is common curtesy to include in brackets the scientific notation (like i did)
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:29:42


Zeroblock. It's not a wallet but it's very nice for checking the prices (and reddit)
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:52:25
Yes he does
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:17:27
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:51:56
They're sending a postcard. . . so since it is something physical it might be hard to scam.
@_date: 2013-10-15 14:46:32
It would be sensible for everyone in that line of work to use bitcoin. . . 
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:21:26
Yes that seems the around the right amount fee-wise.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:36:29
Me too. Sending it to different people.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:27:19
Yes exactly -- and I think people (one or many) should be free to call it whatever they want.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:18:31
Yes this is good. Buy, buy :-)
@_date: 2013-09-19 06:25:00
Photocopiers and printers tend to save a copy of whatever they printed. I do hope you didn't print it on a public printer.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:12:29
Constantly telling newbies to search reddit is not very helpful imho
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:27:30
Wow, this is really going down fast. I'm rather surprised.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:57:39
Yes I think alt-currencies will be useful -- just like we have dollars, euros and pounds now.
@_date: 2013-10-02 05:09:21
Very cool. I noticed the Iphone5s is on sale as well but the price seems a bit higher than it's offered in the US.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:50:05
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:18:51
Yeah, me too. Way way more.
