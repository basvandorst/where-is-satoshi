You're right, hardcoded checkpoint is required after distribution and low active stake phase. It's *ugly* compared to BTC pure algo rules but still low price for benefits imo.

Yeah, let TBF teach 5yo how to use BTC, hard way! 
Don't forget to catch them later

Is merchant acceptance a major goal? Maybe P2P lending? My bank offer me loan for 14% APR and calls it a great deal. Would you lend me NBT for 10%? Try to make some legal template for international NBT lending.

I'm sorry but I have to call your estimations a pure BS.
Data from 
By this month most widely used and accepted virtual currency destroyed **less than 5%** (3.65%) of days created thus leaving **more than 95%** coins as a potential minting stake. This % will be lower in the future but for savings currencies, as **PPC** or Swiss Franc :), it will be high enough to secure the network.
Exchanges: it isn't currency design issue! Exchanges deposit systems will eventually evolve to multisig and unlock only when you buy/sell, current design isn't secure(not only for PoS, for all coins).
Checkpoints: until previous point change - we need checkpoint system. After that hardcoded checkpoints, as in BTC, will suffice to protect against old stakes.

Why they don't use their stake? Idk, I do mint. Ppl don't understand that their stake on paper wallet is **less secure**(its value) than actively minting stake. Yup, tragedy of commons- PoS version :)
You referred to arbitrary values, 50% here, without any calcs - that's BS. And now you're trying to discredit the **facts**(cals) by calling me an attacker. I didn't mean to attack your person, if my comment hurt you in any way - I'm sorry.
