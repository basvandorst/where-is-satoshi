Ya I’ve been tying that it’s just the variance in electricity cost that’s really throwing everything out

I just think there could be a correlation to people paying a price for something based on what it actually cost to create it. Prices over that cost figure have future growth priced in or are overpriced on cost.  Prices below that cost figure could be seen as a undervaluation of the asset. It’s cheaper to buy it than it is to mine it. 
If you are long term bullish in the tech and know it’s cheaper to buy rather than mine, that may be a buying strategy. It may also be a load of BS. 
If it’s being factored in as “well whatever people are willing to pay, because they don’t understand it and it’s not quantifiable”. Then fine, that’s what it is.. for some..

What would the price need to be to be profitable?

What I mean by cost is: before you set up the rig I would expect to pay someone something for  the right to use it, own it, or earn from it.  
The rig, electricity and overall process has a fiat cost/value so add them up and you have a cost.
I do accept the variable of people hodling but that doesn’t change or answer the question of what it cost. 
My experience of people who spend shit loads of money in any market (never mind unregulated) is that they want their return and bills paid sharpish. Not eat their own capital down via hodling.  But it is  plausible that participants/miners are happy to have a 5/10/20 year return plan due to the new nature of the sector and their free electricity. 
I would like to meet these people who have free or even near free electricity. 
Is it free after they “set up” a solar farm or hydro plant from their millions?

Thanks ..
So based on above even a reduction of 50% of elec cost would only equate to a 12% re-education in mining cost due to capital costs etc.

So what your saying is the rapture has already occurred?

Thanks for that... I will  look at costs per kWh per location as this seems to be the determining factor really
