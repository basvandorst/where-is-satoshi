Im not really sure. This was just a single day project, I created after school today.. But shouldnt be that hard i guess. I will take a look into it in the next days/week :)

The pot just changes the contrast of the LCD-display.

(Sadly) It isnt referring to my bitcoin balance, but just to your US$ balance. Basically it is (MoneyYouInvested/BTCPriceWhenYouBought)*CurrentBTCPrice) -&gt; that way you will get your current BTC balance in US$. For testing purposes I thought of a scenario where I bought bitcoins for 200$ when the BTC/USD price was at 4500$ - These 200$ would be worth 348$ by now (BTC/USD= 7850$)

I can try to create a second one. But it will take some days, because I have to order some parts again. Will probably cost around 60$ (Raspberry Pi  ~35€, LCD-display ~ 7€, Breadboard etc.) PM me if you are seriously interested!

Danke :D

Just start by connecting your LCD-display to your Pi ( and than just run your code ( is mine)

It allows you to change the contrast of the LCD-display

It's just a test value, but its referring to my current balance. In the code I wrote "200/4500" - so I basically invested 200$ when the BTC/USD price was at 4500$. The "Guthaben" row just displays my current balance (so basically (MoneyYouInvested/BTCPriceWhenYouBought)*CurrentBTCPrice)

Yeah, thats why im also decided to display the US-Dollar value, even though I live in Germany

I just followed this YouTube Tutorial:  Dont forget to assign the GPIO-Pins, like I did in my code (line 9-15)
