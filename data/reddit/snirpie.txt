Tulip mania has its reputation to thank from a gross misrepresentation. Yes, some people lost money over it, but they were essentially trading technology condensed in tulip bulb. It powers a billion dollar industry in The Netherlands to this day. Let them think about that.

Got one as well. Wasn't Bittrex compromised the other day? Maybe they are using the account data on other exchanges?
 
~~Any of you guys also registered with Bittrex?~~ never mind that, apparently no connection

There is actually nothing wrong with people moving to Monero either. If people decide to move there, it is because they deem it to be a viable and non-scammy project. Those are sparse.

I was honestly not even aware that was a thing. I did write a couple a letters on a typewriter before the computer moved in. Maybe I was too young to ever get taught that, or it wasn't even a thing where I come from.

Yeah, even beyond referring to Bitcoin Cash as "BCash" and measuring changes by deviations from Satoshi's vision.
 
The market will sort the oscillations out soon enough and, no, it will not damage the entire cryptocoin realm. But that is even besides my point.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:05:42
Other coins hard-fork routinely. As the matter of fact, Bitcoin should fork even for the sake of it. To demonstrate the willingness and capacity to execute a hard-fork, because it will be needed in the future.
 
Problems will arise and will need to be solved. I cannot foresee a scenario where a hard-fork will never be needed. When that time comes, it will be so much more beneficial to have the experience. Especially if it is a pressing issue.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:47:05
As someone not invested in either Legacy Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash: get over it guys. Both coins had enough reasons to go their separate ways and enough support to do so.
 
Both coins may co-exist and even more forks may happen. One may eventually win out and dominate the Bitcoin space. Great. It will probably do so on merit and not for being "true Bitcoin" or some reductio-ad-Satoshim.

Exactly like that time I wanted to eat my lunch in the park and forgot to bring my fork.

5b. Distribute copies oc the seeds among people you completely trust (or transposed versions of the seed without checksum to people you generally trust).
 
9. Maintain several wallets for separate purposes.
 
10. For Satoshi's sake, tell him to look beyond Bitcoin as well. There are interesting projects out there if you know how to cut through the bullshit, with at least equal potential.

Out of all the cryptographers in the world, only Craig Wright has successfully proved **not** to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
 
Sadly the sweary interview has been deleted from Vimeo (too many f*cks?), but that is not the voice of Satoshi, lol
@_date: 2017-08-27 10:05:15
Perhaps you should just loan him the money to buy Bitcoin. And since you are confident that it will move up, he doesn't bother having to repay you if Bitcoin goes down.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:48:46
I think he has just proven that Craig Wright == Peter Todd

I actually made a Limerick once. All words of 3 letters and longer represented a seed word. Same starting letters, not necessarily the same words.
 
Checksum word was the title and it actually rhymed and had the proper metric.
 
Abandoned it when I found out it was pretty hard to recite with the same exact words.

Even then you are bound to run into problems without a tail emission. There is one fork that will divide the community.

I am out actually. If there is strong consensus that the growth can keep going after an ATH, that's my cue to head out.
 
Just held on to some of my Monero and Sia, as my homework suggests that there is a solid chance these will be worth 5 to 10 times more in 2 years.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:11:10


That does sound like the most sensible thing for both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core. Could be implemented as a fixed reward per block into eternity. That should balance out the coins lost in due time (preventing deflation) and keep rewarding the miners to maintain the network.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:52:08
One such solution is already out there...

How about finally a flexcap and get this sh*t over with?

What we need is a way to generate additional blinded variations of a public key. The blinded variations would have the same properties as the root public key, such that the private key could generate a signature for any one of them. Others could not tell if a blinded key is related to the root key, or other blinded keys from the same root key. These are the properties of blinding. Blinding, in a nutshell, is x = (x * large_random_int) mod m.
 
When paying to a bitcoin address, you would generate a new blinded key for each use.
 
Then you need to be able to sign a signature such that you can't tell that two signatures came from the same private key. I'm not sure if always signing a different blinded public key would already give you this property. If not, I think that's where group signatures comes in. With group signatures, it is possible for something to be signed but not know who signed it.
 
This is how Satoshi intended the future of Bitcoin to be, and is reflected in coins like Monero, but not yet in Bitcoin :(

Hey hey 
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need 
Hey hey
This is probaly not the right place to be asking for money. Friends and family can help out with that kind of stuff.
Also, if you have no money than you should not feel obliged to buy a gift. I am sure your friend will understand. He/she is a friend after all, right?
@_date: 2017-04-23 09:55:19
Ah, in that case you can places like coinbase to exchange fiat money for bitcoin
 That should really be the quickest way for you.

The know damn well that S2X is going to be trading lower than BTC. Roger Ver was still smart in taking a (for his standard) small bet. It generates quite some attention and ensures that S2X will trade a bit higher.

I hope for your sake that Roger Ver is still taking bets. I hear he gladly gives a BTC for any S2X coin.

IMHO your actions should determine whether you deserve to rule a piece dirt. Especially your actions towards minorties who happen to inhabit the same piece of dirt.
 
The Israelis have not been stellar (no pun intended), but the Arabs are really making a mess of it. All the way back to pogroms btw.
 
That being said, Trump does not think the whole situations is that difficult so it will soon be settled.

Nobody will trust them anyways, as is the (well deserved) sentiment in the middle-east towards governments.
 
On the plus side: they will get a complete trustless setup.

I have a lot of confidence in that project, and I have put my money where my mouth is. Yet there are serious challenges and risks involved. The double-spend bug the other week could have wiped out the whole project, if the developers would not have caught it first.

A reliable system of financial transaction should preferably be completely fungible. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum fall short at the moment.
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:04:52
Sadly I think that all coins fall short now. Monero seems to do fungibility best, but they are years behind in scalability and ease of use. Dash does scalability better, but is essentially centralized. Ethereum and ZCash should have some trust issues because of their history and centralized nature.
 
Either the existing coins will get a lot of work done or something entirely new comes along. There is a lot of progress to be made and Bitcoin's conservatism does not bode well. Which can be fine if they are not aiming for a scalable currency or the solution will be completely off chain.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:05:02
You can also buy drugs with Monero (and pretty soon ZCash). They have the privacy that both Bitcoin and LiteCoin are missing.
