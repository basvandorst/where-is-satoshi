Hi Aces 
Thanks for the feedback.  What I am looking to do, and what is important for my legal article, is to define what we actually own when we own a bitcoin.  Whilst the technical definition that describes the ledger and ditribution of clearing and settlement more closesly could be useful, it may be overly technical for a legal (non-technical) audience.
The thrust of my submission is that when we own a bitcoin, what we own is not the unit in the public ledger, but, rather, the exclusive right to transfer the unit in the ledger to another user (as facilitated by the cryptographic system (for checking the op_checksig) and the node/mining system (for preventing double spending).
What do you think? Is there a way that this could be clarified?

Thanks for the suggestion! 
What do you mean when you describe a unit of work? Perhaps that could be integrated into the definition of the property in bitcoin!
Thanks again!

What about Tiger Air?

Indeed the opposite - to prevent misunderstanding by regulators that could lead to taxation and regulation.

Isn't this quite unsecure?
Anyone know about how this works? or is it just for fun?

Although acceptance would probably be a good measure too

I think you may have misunderstood me, I am writing on behalf of bitcoin, not against it. If the tax offices and prudential regulators misunderstand bitcoin, then, unlike the UK (where it is exempt) and like the US (weher it is not exempted property), then it might be taxed and regulated like an final product rather than exempted like other stores or value and financial instruments.

Why doesn't ripple count?

If you have no identifiers, don't you run into Anti Money Laundering legislation in Canada?

hahah I've done my own research, just stress testing the results of my research to make sure that the tech community is OK with it!

I understand, and respect your opinion. In fact, a tax office's ruling is unlikely to affect you at all! 
The problem is: you and other users of bitcoin would like to spend bitcoin. And the taxation problem hits businesses that take bitcoin hard.
Take a sales tax example. If the tax rate is 10% (paid on each sale), and bitcoin is not exempted from this tax by the regulators, then you will have to pay the 10% tax on what you buy with bitcoin, and you will have to pay 10% tax on their barter for your bitcoin - without an exemption there would be double taxation on businesses that take bitcoin (and the implications for a bitcoin exchange could be bad as well!)
So whilst it probably won't affect us users directly, it will make it much more expensive and complicated to use our bitcoin. That's why I'm interested in the law surrounding bitcoin.

Yeah I read about that! fascinating - although I doubt they would have too many ramifications, since both branches would be substantially identical (the nodes would be processing the same transactions to make them)
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:36:22
That's awesome! I didn't know that. Do you have any sort of news or technical article that I can cite to prove that for my articles?
Appreciate your help!
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:03:21
Thanks! Will do!
@_date: 2014-10-30 01:51:37
So you just allow a client to interface with, essentially, his own wallet?
That is fascinating - I am in this from a law background, and I haven't considered how that type of business would be treated yet. Got me thinking.
Thanks so much for your detailed response!

I would argue that the equitable interest in the bitcoin vests in the transferee upon broadcast; but the legal and technical rights vest upon registration on the blockchain.
That's a point for further down in my article!
Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:48:43
I think the original paper ( talks about double spends very clearly, but not about the possibility of
1. Person 1 transferring his units to person 2, transaction is broadcast
1. Person 2 transferring the units received above to person 3 (legitimately) but before the first transaction was enscribed on the blockchain
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:53:09
That's the spirit!

I am currently writing to Australian regulators, precisely to define such matters (although more for taxation, prudential regulation and consumer protection law then with respect of international treaties). 
My first paper is on defining **a bitcoin** as property. To do so, I need to isolate what we have when we "own" a bitcoin.
Once BTC is held to be property, then we can argue further on whether it is: a security, a financial instrument, money, currency, etc.

Could you have just stuck it on to the phone? 
What's the point of the NFC?

Thank you so much! some of those suggestions are exceptionally helpful! especially some of the terms used like sufficiently confirmed, bitcoin balance, etc.!
I appreciate your help, and would love if you could help me out when my first article is finished?
Would love to keep in contact!
