This is cool, but how many of those transactions are speculative and how many are normal currency transaction? (Curious)
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:57:20
I wouldn't call them irrelevant; I'm just thinking back to when I first got into BTC. I've made maybe 500 transactions   Total, and most of them were related to speculation or moving coins around. Only three of them were payment for goods or services. Now I'm just sitting on my remaining BTC in case it takes off again. I think we can safely assert that PayPal has very few PayPal to PayPal transactions that are are speculation on the future value of that PayPal transaction, eh?

I lost 50BTC to my own shortsightedness. Back when you could first mine them yourself - what, 2010? 2011? I don't remember, but a buddy of mine mentioned BTC to me and we were always fucking with whatever was newest and hottest in tech at the time. We set up miners (this was about the time the dude paid 10k BTC for a pizza or whatever it was) and had each mined a block. Then I kinda lost interest, as did he, and we moved on to whatever our next project was. The machine got re-purposed, the hard drive formatted, then later died, and I didn't think anything of it. LOL. Silly me. But I do wonder how many BTC are out there, orphaned like that.

@_date: 2014-09-23 14:09:00
I got two. MONTHS after they were promised. Difficulty was skyrocketing, and I sold 'em on ebay. Made more selling them than I made mining with them.
[edit] If I had received them when promised, I would have mined four coins per in the intervening time, based on difficulty and mining rate. I WISH they would let me recover that!
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:33:53
Yeah, I figured that into my calculations by accelerating difficulty by 50% of the delay. I know it's a swag, but after thinking about it for a while, I think it's a fair guess.

Sorry to hear that. *sigh*

Thanks for the update! I suspect the value of the natural resource holdings of the US Gov't has increased as well with the advances in extraction.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:33:28
LOL. A buddy of mine and I were, for years, the sort that tries *everything* new just for fun - I mean, I frequently log into a 'new' service to discover that I already have an account because I tried it and forgot about it. 
Well, back when mining first happening, we both ran up linux miners, mined a block or two, then lost interest because the value was .001cents or so. Anyway, the machine has been destroyed and the drives reformatted and ... between the two of us, that's at least 150BTC that was vaporized. 
I have to wonder how many other BTC were vaporized the same way?
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:36:53
Exactly. You can only recover in this situation if you can prove negligence; Negligence cannot be waived.

@_date: 2014-09-17 19:24:37
Great explanation!


While what you say is true, I'm not sure what else they could have done with it. US bonds are considered the safest investment in the world (particularly for $T sized investment). How would it look if they'd taken the trust fund and, say, bought Greek debt?
I think something that should be added to the conversation is that we owe the BULK of that $17T to American interests - people and companies who've purchased T bills and bonds. 
Last I checked was last year some time, but our total debt to foreign interests was on the order of $5T, with the rest being all domestic holders. 
Also, I get tired of the jokes about "Calling China and asking to borrow money", when in reality the US issues bonds and bills which are then auctioned to buyers who are looking for a safe place to put their cash. 
Another thing - we hold, what, $6T in foreign notes? That the 'world' owes us?
And last but not least, the holdings of the Federal Government - assets, so to speak, including foreign properties (military bases, embassies, and other holdings) and domestic holdings, are conservatively valued at a mind-boggling $200T+ (including mineral rights, fishing rights, etc). That doesn't even count the holdings of the American people, which are part of the "full faith and credit of the United States Of America" according to the Supreme Court, and tops $70T.

Right, I mean, I haven't done any captures, but I would have guessed the origin IP was obscured in the tunnel as the routing server is the "endpoint" from the serving GUI, right?

Thanks. I've read some Bastiat, but I'll read it again; it's been a *long* time. As I recall, my main objection to his analysis was the complete failure to address the question: "What kind of creature is a human being?", and no solutions offered to the problems created by the answers. Hayek and friends suffer the same fate. Some others *ask* the question but get it completely wrong (according to observable data, not my opinions). 
I suppose it depends on whether or not you believe philosophy should remain "pure", or what empirical information should inform philosophy as philosophy has informed empirical investigation.
Ultimately, the "individualist" philosophers as a class reject the inevitable, 'pragmatic utilitarianism' of the real world.
Also, the ones that talk about the “individuality, liberty, property.” *also* avoid the question, "How long must I possess something that is stolen before it becomes, legitimately, my property?"
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:14:44
The point being is that if you don't shoot them, they largely won't shoot you. In fact, if you don't engage in violence, they usually won't either (for tax evasion). So the *first* gun is *yours*. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:09:00
What you're fishing for is not there. Unless you engage in deadly force, the vast majority of the time, the police won't either. Which was the point. 
They treat you *exactly* the way they treat anyone else who has committed a crime. Actually, they're usually nicer, because most people aren't willing to get their ass beat and compromise their chance at minimum security and perhaps suspended imposition by escalating to an "assaulting an officer" charge. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:59:52
I wonder how many BTC are lost? By "lost" I mean, when you could first mine your own and the difficulty was ridiculously low and BTC were worth fractions of a penny, I had mined a block (as did a friend of mine), then lost interest, took off on some other tech project, and the drive ended up getting formatted, the address/key lost. So those BTC are lost forever. Question I have is, how many more are like that?
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:57:31
I'm not sure that's true. Jail time can be extremely compelling.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:18:49
Hey, I had a positive ROI. I got two of the 5TH units, mined enough to pay for 'em, and sold 'em at auction on ebay for considerably more than I paid for them. Despite the fact that BFL took months longer to deliver it than they had promised. Those guys are jackoffs.
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:34:04
Been there, done that. If they're feeling friendly, they carry you. If they aren't, they drag you. You wrestle with 'em, they will rough you up a bit. You said "murdered", which involves death. In the vast majority of such interactions even in these precarious police-relations times, the person being arrested is not killed.

@_date: 2016-01-06 17:23:05
[Yeah, no.](
You can certainly say that such work is valueless, but one can make the same argument for any currency or property. Gold, say - it's only got value because we all agree that it has value. If we decided it was no longer useful or desirable to possess, its value would drop to zero. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:33:17
While it sounds like you and I might agree on some of the *issues*, we disagree on some fundamental definitions. "Theft" and "Stealing" are *unlawful taking*. Taxes are not "unlawful" by definition, as they have to be enacted by law. 


Mostly, this isn't true. I mean, we've passed some laws since 2001 that make this *possible* in some sense, but I get the feeling your objections wouldn't have been any different before those laws, when even those cases didn't exist. The government operates by the rule of law. We can certainly debate who has undue influence and who doesn't (I suspect we would agree) but that in no way erases all legitimacy. 
The law grants their land claims legitimacy; you can in fact challenge them in court and force a decision to be made by an arbiter of the law. 
You can refuse to recognize the laws, and you'll be dealt with as a lawbreaker. I don't agree with all of the laws - and I wager you don't *disagree* with them all. I certainly don't agree with what is *done* with much of the tax revenue that's taken from me - and it's a *lot*. But that doesn't mean the taking itself is illegal or even illegitimate. 
There will *always* be a social contract. It's the de facto state of humanity. You can like it, hate it, rail against it, reject it outright - and it will *never* go away for more than a small period of lawlessness. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:22:18


I don't recall saying it was fair at all. I said that simply using BTC cannot stop this from happening, because the power relationship is not dependent on the currency type, as the state is paying the person lottery winnings. You agree to their terms when you buy a ticket. So, unlike OP's claim, BTC cannot stop this from happening. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:56:05
I'm not entirely clear how Bitcoin can keeps someone from issuing an IOU. I mean, I dig the BTC concept and all, but there's nothing inherent about BTC that would prohibit a state from issuing an IOU for BTC in a case like this. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:18:55
Perhaps you didn't get this, from the article. The person who received the IOU didn't *accept* it; they had no recourse. The important point here is that the state in this case has *all the power*, and BTC wouldn't change that magically.
It's also worth noting that *any* loan is an "IOU" with a cost. Are you suggesting that BTC renders lending impossible? 
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:23:12
Agreed. Also, one must assume that BTC won't render lending impossible, which is just the issuance of IOUs with a  cost associated. I think OP's claim is specious. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:57:24
The state *could have* deposited the full amount they owed the winners in a trust and achieved essentially the same thing. They didn't do that - ON PURPOSE. So they obviously wouldn't do what you're suggesting if they were paying in BTC; they'd just issue monthly/yearly whatever in a BTC transfer. In which case, right now, they'd be sending out IOUs for BTC instead of $$$. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:31:53
Seems they are using a somewhat slippery definition of liability. I was going to post what you did here, that equity shares are an ownership stake in an object of value (the company), not a 'loan' to the company. I would say, in the broadest sense, that any real property is an asset and not a liability to another. Even my paid-off car is an asset. Perhaps they mean something specific by "financial asset", rather than just an asset of real value?
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:35:08
The company isn't required to pay you dividends. Stock is an ownership share in a company. It's like you and I bought a house together on a 50-50 split. The fact that I own half doesn't make it *your* liability. My half is an asset, your half is an asset.

Brand is amusing. His heart is in the right place. His thought has all gone into his objections, not his "solutions".
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:24:53
Why not? That's exactly what happened in the article posted. The lottery winner loaned their winnings to the state (albeit unwillingly). 
Loans are about obligations, not currency. Most loans are instruments, not currency. My bank issues an instrument to your bank; the transfer is electronic markers. Nobody gets in a big van and delivers the cash to your bank; they swap markers. They move so much money that occasionally when they have to settle up, they trade some actual cash. 
I get what you're saying - if people will only accept *actual BTC* xfers, then you'd have to have them in your wallet before you could loan them out. But we could make that the law for cash, too, we just don't, and BTC wouldn't change that. The banks make too much money on marginal banking to allow that to go away. Besides, the cost of loans would skyrocket if we eliminate marginal banking, and the economy would shrink like a cheap shirt left in a hot dryer too long.
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:54:57
We could debate how deep the shit is, but that's not really the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you need laws to change that, not BTC. Also, like I said, eliminating marginal banking would reduce the size of the economy by 90% overnight, making the Great Depression look like a boring Tuesday afternoon. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:38:41
So I looked up "Financial Asset":




An asset that derives value because of a contractual claim. Stocks, bonds, bank deposits, and the like are all examples of financial assets.
Bitcoin doesn't seem to me to fit this definition, as it doesn't derive its value from any contractual claim.

It has nothing to do with number of nodes or how many nodes are miners. It's about controlling 51% of the *hash rate*. If you can do that with ten nodes, you can still mount a 51% attack. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:03:47
The source and destination in the blockchain are only relevant if you can tie them to a "real" identity - which is *not* included in the blockchain. Furthermore, if I send you all the BTC in my wallet, and then delete it, it's not possible to prove it came from me, AFAICT, as there's nothing to tie me to the address in question. 
You can certainly trace activity if you have information external to the BTC protocol. I suspect you could trace activity via the network if you owned enough of the peers to tell what transaction originated where (by watching propagation and logging IP addresses and stuff). But the information in the blockchain alone is insufficient to identify you, as I understand it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:14:32
I thought the financial institution was supposed to report it?
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:13:32
I'm pretty sure that if I'd gotten mine within three weeks of ordering, it would have been ~55BTC. If I'd have gotten it when they promised, it probably would have been ~25BTC. suckage.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:03:24
It's fairly obvious that such a declaration of illegality wouldn't stop many folks from using BTC.
You don't have to declare all electronic commerce or money transfer illegal to make BTC illegal. You could, for instance, require all "Electronic monetary transfer orders" to contain identification of the source and destination. That would put paid to BTC as it's designed NOT to contain that information. It would also exempt cash because you don't transfer it electronically.
It's also clear that most people in the US won't risk it if the government decides that trading in BTC is de facto legal evidence of tax evasion (as they've decided that, for instance, sharing a song online is de facto proof of damages to the copyright holder). It won't stop BTC's use, but it will certainly stop it from growing to be a widely-accepted currency, which is the goal as I see it. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:11:58
Exactly. And likely declare trading in BTC as evidence of wrongdoing (tax evasion, etc). After all "If you're not dodging taxes or laundering money, there's no reason not to use USD."

I don't mind Unity all that much; if they fixed a couple of bugs, it would be pretty nice. I just mean that I know people who can't get their head around it. Many long-time non-techie windows users go bonkers when the interface changes. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:23:32
I agree that linux *can be* simpler than windows. The big problem is that most distros have departed from the Windows "start menu" paradigm and many people find it impossible to use (Unity, for instance). Ironic that Microsoft is also abandoning the start menu paradigm... LOL

If I believe in BTC, there's no reason for me to stop mining. If I think the value of BTC will quadruple in some period of time, then I can bet that will be the case by mining even as the difficulty doubles. 
My little 1Ghash GPU rig generated 1.2 BTC last month, and will hit 1.2 again this month, with difficulty at ~12M. If difficulty goes to ~24M, it will be .6BTC/mo. If I think the value of BTC will continue to go up, there's no reason for me to bail out, even when it doubles again to ~48M, and .3BTC/mo. As long as I believe in the long term value increase of BTC, I can't imagine why I would stop mining 'em, regardless of difficulty.
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:50:31

Banks and Credit Cards consider fraud losses "costs of doing business". It requires no "central authority" for a BTC wallet service to provide insurance against theft, it only requires sufficient profit generation for them to fund it and offer it. As online wallets come online and become cash-flow-positive, you'll see offers like that.
