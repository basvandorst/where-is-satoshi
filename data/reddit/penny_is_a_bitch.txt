I got an email from them today saying that there was a failed login attempt on my account.
Haven't even been to the website in over a year now. Meh

Classic case of more money than brains

By instamine you mean a large amount was mined off the bat? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:08:26
Can someone link me to relevant material on learning about keys and signatures and stuff, please

How would someone distribute child porn in the bitcoin blockchain? What are you talking about?
I demand you give me my internet token back.

OK, you be mad. I guarantee you that one day people will start being charged/sued for distributing stuff via nodes.
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:05:17
Maybe they just needed to pay some bills and told you a load of shit. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:49:09

Yeah, true, true. I think he was lumping all alts together so I just said no to keep it simple.
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:50:16
what is this and why do i want it
@_date: 2014-10-08 04:10:57
Child porn and other shit would be running through your phone, basically
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:36:27
In other words,
"Please hack us"
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:37:11
Or blackcoin. No mining at all..
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:05:10

What, 19 dollars isn't bad 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:31:18
why wouldn't it? It's a useless coin. 4 to $33? cmon 
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:43:46
bitcoin is a shitcoin at this point as far as I'm concerned. But it's a household name and our gold standard. It is what it is.
I don't hate litecoin, I just don't see the magic internet money community ever switching over to it and it's current value wont hold.
I would love to be wrong though. Honestly. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:05:29
some guy did something similar with blackcoin a few years back. It was getting a lot of hype at the time
