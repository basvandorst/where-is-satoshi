Maybe you can put in another 25K... then your buy price will be the average of $1100 and $250 = $675...
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:23:22
Thanks for your reply! Cheers!
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:34:29

I guess bitcoin price (in USD/other currency) = exchanges (rate)... or else 1 BTC is 1 BTC.

This is still not easy... What is the format of the address? Are punctuation such as comma and full stop included? Since it is an international organization, the address in which country will be used?
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:13:29
I found it. It's Médecins Sans Frontières with address at 78ruedeLausanneCasePostale1161211Geneva21Switzerland.
... but wait, someone else got it ~~10~~ 30 minutes before me! So close!
