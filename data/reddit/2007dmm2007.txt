ETH is still a baby in crypto so it is very vulnerable to bugs in the code etc so I don't expect it get very far in the short term. However long term, it sounds like one of the few crypto-currencies with some potential (up until now).
 It's also worth noting that BTC is capable of doing most/if not all of what ETH can do, through side chains and things like rootstock.

I'm holding some ETH atm because I think it's one of the alt coins that will get a pump while bitcoin is consolidating, but other than that ETH has been all talk for the most part. It's been over a year now. Show me some working dapps and maybe I will change my mind....otherwise it is all "theoretically on paper" too.

This is done with other games as well, the difference is you run the risk of being banned on games when you are buying and selling their virtual currencies. With bitcoin there's no risk of anyone banning you/taking your money due to violation of ToS

couldn't agree with you more

you think there is moaning on ....? Have you seen If you go there be careful, you might get cancer. I actually enjoy browsing on most days.

Lol I don't even use Bitstamp because of their KYC. Same goes for many others in the bitcoin community. Apart from that they are great though :) 
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:48:05
maybe the rise is not over :) chinese is still leading the way
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:14:09
Yes many sites do. For many games..not just WoW. Although it is not mentioned much, bitcoin is actually thriving in the online game/mmorpg virtual currency gaming markets.
@_date: 2016-11-21 20:50:23
bitstamp is a great exchange despite their KYC/AML. You have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:56:19
bitcoin has its first mover advantage yes. You also forgot to mention one VERY important thing. Bitcoin is SECURE. Far more secure than any other blockchain will ever be for now. This is extremely important. Can't emphasize this enough. Not my fault if you fail to see that.
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:30:12
patience guys. this is the move where we make it to 800 and beyond IMO. China is still $20+ ahead. These things take time to play out. Give it a week or two.
@_date: 2016-11-20 03:07:13
They will come in time..check the core roadmap. And until then segwit will provide a slight increase in capacity from what I understand. The sooner we stop this childish bickering, the sooner all of these updates we have all been looking forward to will come. 
Enough is enough...

This guy is a moron. Bitcoin has no use?...really? 
Picture this scenario (which really isn't that unrealistic for this day and age if you think about it)- Nuclear warfare (or some other catastrophic event) is about to break out/has just broken out in your country and you want to move overseas ASAP. Life or death situation potentially. Good luck bringing all of your gold with you with no trouble or delay. You either leave the gold behind or go through the hassle and risk involved in somehow bringing it all with you.  One of bitcoins main uses (and much of its value) comes from the fact that you can send any amount of money anywhere in the world extremely fast and for a low cost.   You could also hop on a plane that same day with all your bitcoins with no trouble at all in the scenario given above.  Keep in mind this is one of many scenarios that could play out at some point in the future.
This video was in 2013 so I would like to think this guy has educated himself by now and changed his opinion on bitcoin and no longer compares it to the tulip mania. If he still thinks the same...then he really is an absolute moron lmao.

As someone who is very familiar with this field I am telling you it is against most games' ToS including WoW. Just because you can look up buying and selling wow gold on google does not mean the game maker themselves allow it. Tons of people do it anyways and that's why you see all these advertisements. However the company that created the game still has the right to ban you/take your gold if they catch you doing this.

"skyrocketting" lol. it has only just begun!
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:47:03
idk how so many people are having problems. I've been sending transactions all day long with 10-15 cent fees and they confirm on the first block.
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:40:25
I don't think it matters, but right now your best option would be to buy from a US/western site because bitcoins are trading at a $25-40 premium on chinese sites the past few days. So you will get a better price on the US sites. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:11:02
Yes, exactly. For years people needed to use trusted middle men who took a commission in order to buy and sell their virtual game currencies. Players could not trade among themselves because of paypal chargebacks and paypal not supporting virtual currency transactions. Now with bitcoin this has changed. It's really a great thing and it's just one example of how bitcoin can change things for other ecosystems in the future.
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:19:41
Right. I believe that as long as you have a US bank account you will be ok. You can try sites like
these sites are the easiest for newcomers looking to acquire bitcoins.
If that doesn't work for whatever reason then you can wire money from your bank account to a bitcoin exchange and purchase them that way. This is the way most people do it. Some good sites are

i send multiple bitcoins almost daily and have never had to pay more than a dollar or two. downvoted.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:39:50
really because i see $9k total fees. 
edit: ok i just saw that as well, but then i refreshed and now i see ~$9k total again. idk what's happening :P lol
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:43:46
same! what an awesome song
@_date: 2016-11-20 02:35:23
We want segwit! We have been waiting over a year now.
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:11:16
I did the same. Running a core node and bought some LTC 
 segwit
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:04:23
works for me.
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:30:06
doing what I can to support BTC SW. i run a full node and i will be buying some litecoin today. it will be the only alt coin i am invested in, but it is worth buying since the price increase will show how much segwit really means to people. lightning network will be cool to test out too.
