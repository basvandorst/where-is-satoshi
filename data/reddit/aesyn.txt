Oh god people like you should be banned from handling money more than 10 dollars.

There should be an acronym for the opposite of FUD because 90% of this sub is actually doing this whenever they can.
"It always happens, don't worry". Yeah not always. The only crash similar in scale happened back in late 2013 and it took 3 years for btc to recover. Since this time it got bigger and it crashed (I mean will continue to crash) bigger, recovery will not be easier. 3 years from now, uninformed masses won't be as easy to be convinced in investing in btc as today. Not to mention the competition is more serious now.

Stop getting stuck to the word "inherent". If I'm in need of something really valuable like food, medicine, housing or anything, I can trade dollars for them. This is what makes any currency valuable. If it cannot be used for trading reliably, their worth is nothing.
Crypto currencies need to evolve to match the modern needs. If even only Amazon started to accept Bitcoins tomorrow, they would clog the network. Bitcoin needs time and development, not blind fanatics who are trying to get rich quick.

You could have multiplied your wealth with 5 if you actually sold your bitcoins and buy them after it crashed lol. "I told you so" people were right and are still right.
