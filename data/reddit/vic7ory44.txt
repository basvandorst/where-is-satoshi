Kraken's been shady since day 1.. A friend tried them soon after the exchange opened, made a few trades and a (relatively) small usd withdrawal.. Nothing came, no answer from support

EVOLVE MARKETS &amp; BITMEX &amp; 1BROKER
but please, don't trust them with a lot of money, only a percentage of your btc ! And maybe spread it over a few different platforms. 
There's more than enough leverage anyway, you don't need to deposit lots of btc to have a bigger position.

yep, you re correct
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:11:12
Hhaha this is awesome !
Yesterday I closed my bank account and today I'm closing the other one.
I hate the current currency and banking system, I prefer crypto - the red pill
edit: the best part was when I wrote bitcoin in the field reason for closing account.

or havelock investments
or the mining btc stocks in 2012
or gox yeah
or any other pumpcoin
or spending them on bullshit
I'd recon the people that actually managed to hodl since 2010-2011 are a few hundred at best. Most just lost the coins when they were cheap.

Crypto is a way out of the matrix. It's a way for people to think outside the box because nothing like this has ever been done before. It's like another financial dimension.
It's as much a revolution of the mind as it is a (r)evolution of money.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:22:43
People are just cogs in the machine. The whole financial system is corrupt. Money based on debt.  Fractional reserve. Quanitive easing. Etc..
And our central banker overlords keeping the world in interest-debt slavery. They have the power to create endless money at will, who wouldn't abuse that power? The debt is ever increasing, look at us debt celling.
Crypto has the chance to change the whole system, not only the corrupt people but the system itself. The more people that take the red pill , the weaker this parasitic financial system become.
Long live Crypto
Fuck the Banks

Bitcoin is a revolution of the mind. People just didn't know any better, now we have bitcoin. People realize there is another way, a way out of this corrupt system. This is the biggest threat. Changing the way people think about money makes the current monetary system weaker. And it's weak enough as it is. One big illusion of ever growing debt, too big to fail banks? Well now we can do without them.

Not only they didn't go to jail, but lot's of execs actually gave themselves even more bonuses WITH the bailout money.
Banks aren't too big to fail now, bitcoin is here. FUCKING GREEDY PIGS
Next time the banking system fucks up, we all go to bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:39:22
Gonna save this post. Bankers are CRIMINALS. They even gave themselves bonuses with the bailout money. The central banking system and fractional reserve is unfair, it's a cancerous system that's increasing wealth inequality.
Bitcoin is bankers and governments worst fear, because it takes away from their power and gives personal freedom to the people. That's why I love bitcoin and the crypto revolution.
FUCK EVIL BANKS
BITCOIN IS KING
