Word I've seen the movie just wasn't familiar with the specific term of Turing-complete. Really appreciate the link.

Perhaps he has a lot of BTC

Well if he invented BTC, he has had plenty of time to get acquainted with feeling arrogant. Imagine if he read the Posts on this sub once a week. I'd say it'd be nigh impossible to not become quite arrogant in that position.

Ignored for failure to properly use too. And other miscellenia.

Nothing overtly nefarious. I guess I am curious from the standpoint of, here I am hoping to hold in long term storage. Should BTC appreciate in value, will mixing them prior to stashing in trezor be tax advantageous?

Interesting quotes about the tax auditor. He just got raided by AUS tax authorities. So...

Oh boy

Mind informing a noob?
What's a nonce in Bitcoin sense. I googled, but don't really understand. Any chance of an ELI5

Stop thinking your pedantry adds value.

A great explanation of SPV

Also be advised. This does not display properly on AlienBlue iPhone.

Based on what. I'm curious how this is gauged scientifically. If it even can be.
@_date: 2015-09-25 04:32:32
I want to learn more about this. Any recommended resources?

Hot brunette could be a programmer.

No, it just goes to show that Bill Maher has a very poor grasp of what his own beliefs are.

I hope you are kidding.

Been wanting to ask this for awhile. This thread seems the right place.
Can't an entity, let's say 'evilcorps' in keeping with the sentiments of most in on this thread... Can't evilcorps astroturf their blockchain while proprietary and "in house" and under their strict control to make it have a longer history (or at least many more transactions) than our beloved BTC blockchain? Then opening it up as a nonproprietary open source type coin. Thu leapfrogging BTC.
I'm sure its obvious I don't really understand the blockchain. But I'm just going off this general idea I hear a lot which seems to say that BTC is the largest blockchain cryptocurrency yadda yadda, it can't be outpaced.
Wouldnt astroturfing initially to catch up to BTC be possible for say the Federal Reserve to do of this if it becomes apparent that all currency needs to be blockchain reconciled. They just make USDcoin with an astrpturfed 100gig blockchain and then release into public.
Forget the part where the fed would never relinquish control of the money supply. I'm just using the fed as an example in this hypothetical.
Tl;Dr - can some large entity astroturf a different blockchain and effectively take away btc's incumbency advantage.
@_date: 2015-03-07 08:04:34
Agreed. Curious if anyone knows of any projects that are being designed to encourage unwitting use of BTC. Like, could someone design an Uber or Seamless 'extension' that autoconverts the payment into BTC before sending it. That's just an example and a shitty one. But maybe it helps to illustrate my point.
Or another, better example, might be how URL shorteners are reportedly routing us thru many different places (behind the scenes, for various data collection reasons) all without us 'seeing' any of that.
