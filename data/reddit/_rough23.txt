It's interesting that the community seems convinced a small group of developers is its central weak point, when the entire system security could be compromised by maybe 6 people coming together and agreeing to do so -- or being forced to by law. In reality, the developers have very little power (they can easily outstretch their mandate, if they act without consensus). Further, everything they do is subject to public scrutiny.


That isn't how I would characterize the developers in our community. When we talk about "system governance" what we're saying (especially w.r.t Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies) is *how* the system changes and what decides it will change. Of course, years ago that terminology would not be lost on so many of you (especially the concept of consensus) but as this community has grown, it has brought in a lot of people blissfully unaware of the actual principles underlying the network.
The idea that the core devs are being "selfish" is also laughable. I think it's safe to say you do not follow Bitcoin's development aside from hot-button issues like this, so you wouldn't understand the volunteering, sacrifice and knowledge that the developers and experts in the community have collectively given. Otherwise you'd pause and ask yourself why you're in the minority of these experts. And no, they don't all work for blockstream.
I would like to mirror what sipa says about consensus (paraphrasing): "consensus networks are consensus systems, either get everybody to agree, or don't do it." Bitcoin is not meant to be 51% attacked by people empowered to change the design or rules of the network. The rules are not subject to majoritarianism. Otherwise, you signal to everyone here that none of the rules are permanent, and that there is no reliability in its guarantees about security, inflation-resistance and decentralization. You might not feel concerned about this, but any of us that want Bitcoin to succeed do.
That may be exactly the conditions you create with a hasty move that doesn't involve near-unanimous consensus from the community, from our experts, and from miners.
Does this mean we should never fork? No, we should be able to fork if our development team goes rogue. *So stop fucking saying that every time we try to explain that to you guys.* The development team is being conservative and they do care about security and scalability. Are you willing to hinge your bets on this being a big conspiracy by the most reputable people in our community to destroy the currency?
Because the consequences if you're wrong are not very good.

The bitcoin core developers are constantly making important changes. There is a thorough process for reviewing those changes and a high standard for accepting them. Don't doubt that the core developers all are concerned about scalability and have all done enormous research and entertained a long discussion about this issue. They aren't just pretending like it's not a big deal and ignoring the problem, just because they didn't accept Gavin's proposal.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:24:21


That's not... even remotely true. People like Gregory Maxwell are largely regarded, at least by people who know what they're talking about, as the foremost experts on all matters of cryptocurrency. Maybe only on reddit with this toxic, unappreciative atmosphere toward the core devs would you find that opinion anywhere.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:22:22
Account is only 2 months old, but I have much older reddit accounts (&gt;4 years old) I would prefer not to use because I try to throw them away after a while. I've been part of the bitcoin community (including as a developer) under another alias for years, would show proof of this via IRC to one of you if you'd like. Completely support the policy. (Only interested in temporarily being a moderator until things die down a bit.)
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:07:10
The leading researchers are researching, developing other solutions. Scalability is something they spend a lot of time on, and has more involved than just the block size limit. This is not a senseless stall tactic for some dogmatic fear of hard forking. You can code your heart out if you'd like and accomplish nothing positive.
The "process" is achieving a consensus of core developers on an issue which is thoroughly debated and motivated formally in BIPs. If the core developers institute changes without this consensus, we can consider the process has failed and find a different team and/or process. Right now they're being conservative and the vast majority of technical expertise in the community is recommending caution.
The point of a process isn't for governing the protocol, it's all about *coordination* and avoiding risky changes. If that coordination splinters and technical decisions are turned into political contests, lots of people with stake in Bitcoin are going to cease finding it credible.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:13:32
Doing nothing *for now* while other options are assessed and discussion can take place is not hostile, that's the de facto action taken during bitcoin's development. It's called being conservative and achieving consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:28:00
As an example, miners could collaborate to execute a 51% attack to harm their competitors and take more of a reward. This would be irrational because it would destroy the value of the coins they mine. Unless, of course, it can be done without people realizing it. In some respects miners don't care about the protocol and put their short term profits first, SPV mining being a great example. After all, there is a short window to get a return on their investments in hardware before they are outpaced by better tech.
As another example, variance would encourage miners to all use a single pool, which has visibly nearly happened before, but this would also be irrational because it would centralize the protocol and destroy the value of the coins.
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:49:56
A process handing Hearn more control and reputation than some of the leading researchers in cryptocurrencies is a joke. Hearn submitting concrete code for the community's approval, even more so -- this fork is a good demonstration of what threshold of approval he's seeking. He was useful early on, but has only proved to be divisive and aggressive as things have evolved.
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:19:26
The "why" is explained in my post. It damages the reliability and credibility of the decision-making process Bitcoin undergoes when making protocol changes. It changes how we coordinate those changes and sets an ugly precedent for future disputes over technical matters.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:25:20
It's simple: if the dev team starts doing stuff without consensus, they've gone rogue. If they're *not* doing things *because* there isn't a consensus, then they're doing their job.
There is nothing subjective about it.

This comment effectively represents the density of thought put into most of the comments advocating for the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-23 07:34:01
Okay, now you're just being an asshole. How long my account has been around has nothing to do with the merit of what I'm saying. If you look at my comment history I actually didn't intend to contribute at all to this subreddit. I make throwaway accounts every 6 months on average just to avoid having an online personality.
Based on what you said, I don't think you actually understand how LN works. I think you should visit IRC sometime and tell them you've just discovered such obvious glaring issues with their research. How could they be so stupid?
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:35:09
The core devs are not banning people voicing out opinions. The moderators of this subreddit are. The reason they are is the exact attitude the OP is addressing in this post: I have seen every flavor of dismissal and insult lobbed at the core devs in the last few days here that it has completely taken me by surprise. The emotional reaction of the XT advocates has drowned out any actual discourse on this subject. People who generally have no clue about the technology have commented with the most ignorant misconceptions.
I don't understand how a community could shoot itself in the foot like this. You have all tried to throw the core devs under the bus -- the people working tirelessly to make the *right* decision at the *right* time -- using a technical misunderstanding sourced from a PR campaign by someone who benefits the most from forking Bitcoin and taking hold of its development. You then act as if it's just a choice; you're just rebelling. In actuality, you threaten to remove the foundation of process and decision-making that underlines the currency, because the developers aren't being aggressive *enough* with a change. The consequence will be a huge loss to its credibility.
If I were a core dev and this toxic community continued, I'd leave for something else and let this currency die. There are plenty of other options and experiments being developed that they could improve on and invest in. Treating your developers like this sets the standard for their replacements and the community you want to build for future users. Good forward thinking. Personally, if we want to salvage anything, we should purge these kinds of people and their comments. They are the source of stupid memes like "Honey Badger" and everything else that is dumb about bitcoin.

XT doesn't really exist with a modified consensus protocol yet. Until it actually diverges it's still following Core's consensus model, is it not? In fact it is very possible that XT will never diverge at all and will always follow the same protocol as Core.
Unless you consider the "75% agree then we change" part of the consensus protocol. But if you define it that broadly, every hardfork produces a new altcoin, which is clearly not what you're advocating.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:00:15
All the email shows is what we all know -- Gavin is abusing his position as "chief scientist" (which is itself spurious at best) to push XT in the media. He of course, is not a chief scientist of anything. He has not been involved in Core development for a while. And he barely does any actual research or "science."
As the email states, regardless of your position on XT, that's not good for bitcoin. That is a reasonable opinion and does not concern me.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:23:02
Another important point is that people should *not* confuse 75% of the community with 75% of the miners. We have historically been able to achieve overwhelming (&gt;95%) agreement on protocol changes in soft forks. If a change is in the best interests of the currency (like a block size increase would be), and especially in the best interests of the miners' own bottom lines, we can expect almost all of them to agree. Especially if all of our technical experts are on board.
The only real purpose in not requiring 100% is that some miners might forget to update or not even know this is happening, which itself is pretty generous.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:25:54
Well, he's not a *scientist* by any stretch of the imagination. Edited my post to reflect that. I do consider him an expert.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:07:13
You're injecting your personal opinion of the merit of a block size increase -- something I have not done in any of my comments. I think this indicates more of your motivations than mine. I'm speaking of a much more abstract problem -- that we're making this decision by bypassing a process meant to achieve broad consensus.
I'm trying to convince people that XT is a bad idea and will hurt Bitcoin's credibility as something that develops and matures gradually with conservative decision-making and engineering practices. I don't want XT to be adopted, as my title made it plainly obvious.
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:46:31
I'm not sure what's going to stop miners from *being* the only nodes left in the future. Surely not this community, if the last few weeks are any indication.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:59:44
There's an "if" qualifier in the first several syllables of my comment which generally makes this an address to anyone who thinks XT will succeed.
Checkpoints are a way of anchoring the blockchain to a certain position. Mike would checkpoint it at a position where a block not allowed on the other chain was allowed on XT, thus forcing miners to choose which chain to mine on.
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:10:06
He's not wrong about what he wrote, but it doesn't matter to me how Peter Todd feels about it. This fork hurts Bitcoin in other ways, even if it increases choice -- mainly because it could actually be adopted.

I'm imagining a future with a "mining union" which is open access and acts as a counter-balance against user interests. We already see the beginnings of this: mining companies apparently meet regularly in China and come to mutual decisions about how they will act.
I think as a community we need to be aware when these organizations form -- we should begin to consider whether major mining pools in China are practically the "same pool" or at least realize the separation is wordplay at best.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:45:42

@_date: 2015-08-16 21:46:02
"1MB-er devs" are not ignoring they're disagreeing. That is completely different. And they happen to be the majority of the core dev team. It's Gavin and Mike who thought because they didn't get their way, they should disrupt a process which is designed to prevent aggressive unmotivated changes.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:24:03


This is a good question, but it should be phrased as, "At what point should we then conclude that the process isn't *working*?" 
The process did come up with a solution -- leave things the way they are, continue the debate and search for other solutions, and in the mean time achieve scalability through other mechanisms.
The process can be considered failed when it actually fails and we hit a technical barrier with our technology, something we're still far off from at this rate of change. It'd be better to hit that barrier because we're too conservative about our changes, than to make a poor change that creates worse problems. That's a fundamental principle of Bitcoin's development.

Yes, yes indeed. I mean, a halfhearted attempt at cleaning the community up would only make things worse. If everybody dumb enough to hop on this fork left, I think this place would be much better. Personally I think they should keep this policy in place indefinitely, but I think they aren't planning to.
Why would anyone who disagrees with the mods come back anyway? This could just happen again.
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:08:11
You've missed the point entirely. 75% isn't just on the "low side of thresholds" it's *not* a near-unanimous consensus. Something that only achieves 75% support among miners alone (not to mention the community and experts) is not "uncontroversial" as sipa describes.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:23:53
So if Core included BIP101 in the next version they released, it would be an altcoin until "the entire economy actually moves" to the fork? I don't buy that.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:47:14
I'm not a fan of the XT fork, but I really don't like this "altcoin vs. hardfork" crap. I think it's wordplay. The reality is, Luke is calling XT an 'altcoin' when it hasn't even forked yet. We have no idea whether or not the old chain will be abandoned. I think it probably would be, but who knows. If it weren't, yes, it would be an altcoin.
Please don't insult Luke for this, it's a genuinely held opinion. I just think he's wrong here. Maybe he'll change his mind.
Another important point, "altcoin" shouldn't be an insult in this community anyway, but it is sadly. That's all of your fault, frankly.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:33:42
BUT HOW WILL THE BALANCE BE KEPT?
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:34:01
It isn't about 75% being "fair" it's simply **not** a consensus. There is no precedent for even a soft fork at that threshold of acceptance. The 10% I'm throwing out there is *generous*, the core devs might demand an even higher threshold. The only sense in it not being 100% is that some miners might be lazy or forget to update. If a change is so good for miners and so good for the currency, then it should be accepted by almost everyone.
Half of the network has been shown to be SPV mining anyway, so in reality this fork could proceed with a vastly smaller portion of the hashrate. 25% is not an insignificant portion. That could represent one gigantic pool blocking action. It could also represent dozens of smaller ones who are being *ignored*. This is a basic principle of the protocol from inception: nothing should be so controversial that it skates by without a quarter of the incentive structure behind it.
Forks are sometimes necessary, for example if the developers were trying to introduce changes despite consensus. In this case, they are being conservative and avoiding making a change *for now* that almost all of them think will introduce problems. Jumping in, as others do, with the "but it's a CHOICE" horseshit ignores the fact it is splintering the community, the miners, and the reliability of the decision-making process for changes to the protocol. It is undermining the credibility of the currency for anyone with a financial interest. And worse, it's creating a toxic and divisive atmosphere of ignorance which is showing any potential contributors that Bitcoin is not the future.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:51:42
The only reason I hold bitcoins is because the protocol can change when virtually everyone agrees it's for the best. Otherwise, it's a majoritarian currency, and I have zero faith in the long term rules that bind it.
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:37:56
I'm only stating the obvious truth of the matter. I'm not appealing to authority to discourage the block size increase, but I am giving plenty of good reasons not to support a fork. Forking despite widespread technical disagreement is a very, very bad idea. Especially since the majority of the people behind XT here have no clue what they're talking about, as evidenced by most of the comments I've read or responded to.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:04:54
It's not the changes that are impulsive, it's the fork itself. There wasn't a consensus to increase the block size *right now* or at least in the manner Gavin wanted, and there still isn't a consensus. Not among the users or the developers. There's a lot of people in the community that support it, partly because of Gavin/Mike's blog posts and pleas, but almost all of the rest of the credible engineers involved in Bitcoin opposed it.
Deciding you're right and everyone else is wrong, so you should fork and herd everyone to your fork, based on a scenario that hasn't even happened yet... if everybody in the core team did this when their proposals were rejected, Bitcoin would go nowhere.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:48:05


I really don't think you're familiar with Mike Hearn. I'm actually speaking about abandoning some 20 highly experienced devs for what, 2, one of which has a piss poor reputation compared to the rest of the dev team? He's probably the most controversial developer in the entire community -- well before raising the block size was an issue.


Alright, why don't we just have a different dev team for every major decision someone wants to make and people can just jump from one competing reference client to another in spurts of outrage and emotion? It's pretty obvious that would upset the credibility of the currency because *there will be no development process or coordination anymore*.
Letting the community decide is exactly what is happening right now, I have no problem with it. I'm just recommending the action the community takes.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:58:06
The miner interest aligns with users because *they are users* -- they're being paid in bitcoin. They invested heavily in hardware to mine that bitcoin. They are absolutely bound to the medium/long-term fate of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:55:04

Yes, this is part of the problem I've been railing against. Mike and Gavin have pretended as if the other side had no recognizable counter-argument. They have also been much better at politicizing and propagating this myth in the media.
Inaction is not something the core devs want either.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:17:55
The consensus of miners, developers in bitcoin core, and users are all completely different and we measure them in different ways. When have we ever made a fork that only required 75% of the network to adopt the patch? I've heard the "one big miner" argument, but that's ridiculous. One big miner could be tons of small miners too. These miners all still have incentive to make the best decision they can.
I'm not as concerned with the block size raising as I am with us just abandoning Bitcoin Core and upsetting the current structure of development in the community. I don't think that will bode well.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:41:06
It's disappointing and terrifying that there's this many people who don't understand how the currency works. You don't seem capable of detaching consensus over protocol rules from consensus over the blockchain state. It's the reason why we're worried about a 51% attack to begin with; we don't want a majority of computing power to influence the network governance.
Essentially what you're advocating is for there to be a slim majority (perhaps just a few pools) which coerces the minority into changing the protocol or behavior of the network. It is impossible to detach that from an attack on the network, yet it's the exact description of what you claim is the "underlying principle". In order to achieve certainty and faith in the currency we need a process that decreases the threat of hostile action by collaborating miners.
That means everyone should play their part and not contribute to a plan which doesn't require near-unanimous consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:32:14
You've just demonstrated you don't know what a fork is. Lack of consensus (or, simply, disagreement) is the *definition* of a fork. The network can easily fork without broad consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-22 05:40:53
I love how this mob of XT support takes anything and everything the core devs say out of context, then downvotes the corrections and ensuing discussion... but exercises to give Mike a pass.
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:47:56
Oh. TIL
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:52:30
Consensus is about widespread agreement on the state of the network. If 10% disagrees, yes, there isn't consensus. But 10% can't disagree in this case, because if XT only had 10% share of the nodes, it wouldn't diverge from Core. The question is thus meaningless. If it were programmed to diverge, it would be immediately outpaced and reorg'd by the other chain. If it were checkpointed instead, it would become an altcoin.
And yes, a 90% consensus sounds fine to me.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:28:44
What will happen if the fork takes place? The infrastructure Bitcoin has is very valuable still. But it's not a currency I would be interested in. I don't want to see rules changed without overwhelming consensus. That's what Bitcoin was to me.
I don't think anything will help the price (overall) over the next few months except perhaps if miners begin rejecting XT outright, or this fork conclusively fails. Some have, but not enough. This community, unrelenting in its support of a hostile fork that threatens the development process and credibility of the protocol, is creating uncertainty and risk. I'm watching friends cash out their cold storage right now.

I don't think hero worship is necessary either. But not all of the experts behind "wait, let's lay more options down and come up with the best plan we can" are Blockstream devs. Not all the experts behind "let's raise the blocksize now before it's too late" are Bitcoin Foundation shills.
I understand the concern for both forms of "conflict of interest" you speak of, but I can't provide enough evidence to discredit either side of this argument. I don't think anybody involved is pressured by their employers or investments -- I think it's entirely motivated by ideology. Everybody has a very strong long-term interest in the currency.
I am convinced Mike's side cares far less about decentralization and network security and far more about low transaction fees, which is a perverse balance of concerns.

It doesn't matter that this has been discussed for years, we have not yet had, and still do not have, all of the tools necessary to study the implications of raising the block size limit. And further, the ideas we have about scalability have changed dramatically in the last year. We have other options to explore.
As I stated in my post, if we don't like it, yes we can fork it. However, we're forking it for the wrong reasons -- that our developers aren't being *aggressive* enough with changes, which is not what we signed up for.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:57:38
I think there was a failure, but it was mostly the community itself that has let itself degrade to this point. There is almost no interesting discourse taking place here, and the cause of it are the kind of people pushing for Bitcoin XT -- which just so happens to be antithetical to the currency and the process by which the currency changes.
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:57:42
I appreciate you trying to explain things, but how can you distinguish XT as an "altcoin" and not just a "hardfork" when it's impossible to know the outcome in advance? How do you know the old chain will not be abandoned?
This would help clear things up for everyone.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:44:33

Bitcoin fundamentally relies on the assumption *people* don't fuck it up. Is it doomed?
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:59:02
Agreed. We should also never embrace the concept of a hostile hard fork to force changes without consensus.
As sipa said brilliantly:


This is fundamental to Bitcoin. Get everyone to agree to your change, or don't do it -- or you risk the credibility of the system. This is how it was *designed*.
@_date: 2015-08-23 04:29:25
Yes, of course we can build and deploy LN and other technologies when we reach the limits of BIP101's capabilities. That could be a long time from now. And in the mean time, we cement our infrastructure and our economy around the first layer. Right *now* we need to be building, testing and deploying that technology and moving users into it, not when it is more expensive and less convenient later on.
In effect, we're taking a selfish and short-term route despite being in an aggressive growth situation.
I agree that instant confirmation could be a compelling push for LN and so on. But it's not quite what I'm picturing...
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:50:34
I literally wrote this post addressing this outright, expecting to hear this argument. I stated that the choice and ability of the community to switch reference clients and make these decisions is important. But in this case, we're tossing out a reference client and a process designed to prevent aggressive changes, because the development team is being cautious. That is a dangerous precedent.
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:59:07
The reason anybody is calling it an altcoin is because in the worst case scenario, it would operate completely outside the consent of a quarter of the hashrate -- it acts as a totally different currency the moment that happens. This is why forks target much higher thresholds of consensus, something short of some small amount of nodes who might forget to upgrade. That's a true change in the currency.
I personally don't care to call it an alt-coin because I know what would happen if the fork won. Everybody would switch to it out of self interest, but I am convinced the currency would die anyway because it would lose all credibility. But I can at least understand why they are calling it an alt-coin. It has very little to do with egos and much more to do with Mike and Gavin completely bypassing a process designed to prevent aggressive changes in the currency. Of course they're upset, look at the shit they've been given here in the community despite the fact they have worked tirelessly on scalability and security of the network.
Just look at the crap Mike has stuffed into the new fork, you can see it on [his list]( It's a bunch of shit which doesn't require a fork that he wanted and nobody else did, like making the seeds HTTP which would effectively provide Mike a full list of xt nodes, including ones not listening or ones that don't have discovery enabled. He also added a change for his own personal Lighthouse thing which didn't achieve consensus. What did that stuff have to do with the block size increase? Mike has threatened to fork before many times for stupid crap that has nothing to do with the blocksize increase. He's too aggressive with these changes and doesn't care for consensus at all, and people are eating it up because they want the limit raised so badly.
It surprises me that people are on his side and want to give his client so much authority despite the fact Mike is known to give half a shit about privacy and fungibility. He is the least trusted developer on the entire core team by a wide margin.

Oh the system definitely is immune to capture by a small number of developers. This fork could absolutely work. But that's not what I'm saying, and that's not the point of this fork. It's not "showing off" how resilient Bitcoin is.
We should have good reason to abandon broad consensus on an issue. The fact that highly qualified and experienced engineers in our community aren't convinced it's a good idea is not a good reason to completely abandon the process by which Bitcoin changes. The fact we *can* do it does not excuse the fact it's a bad idea and will hurt Bitcoin's reliability.

Perhaps he doesn't want to say much that he isn't absolutely sure about. After all, he's not involved in the project anymore for a reason.

I think it says a lot when you're in a minority of developers who disagree with you on this point. "There are certainly people" is an understatement. This fork itself is a good demonstration of that.


This is disingenuous. It was our switch to LevelDB that triggered the hardfork -- unknowingly changing the consensus rules. The reality is that shit blows up in our face even when we try really hard to avoid it or think we're doing the right thing, something you have yet to really grasp.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:40:50
Making technical changes without broad consensus because we fear a theoretical situation that might arise falls far outside the standard principle of conservative decision-making I spoke of. That's design by impulse.
Leaving things the way they are *temporarily* while the discussion continues, more options are considered and other ideas are fleshed out is absolutely a solution. That's effectively the "decision" we *constantly* make when developing Bitcoin. It is only when we find compelling motivation in a separate course that we actually do fork. This is the essence of a reliable process.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:31:55
I call them "our developers" because they truly are our developers. And they're trying to do their job. We're not doing ours.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:13:00
In this particular example the infrastructure will likely converge on one of the forks quickly and the value of coins in the other chain would plummet; the change is too inconsequential. But I can't speak for every situation or every hardfork and nor can you. I mean, that's the point of a hardfork: we could hardfork even without the consent of miners, with only a fraction of the hashrate. Hardforks could be deliberate by *both* sides.
@_date: 2015-08-23 07:59:12
You aren't the first to consider some of these problems.
 &lt;-- created by Bitcoin developers, now used by projects like Tor to help address the concerns of evil binaries
There is no real response that can address all of your concerns -- perhaps only never changing the source code ever again would suffice. Real people write all of this code (for now) and there are lots of tools to review, audit, build and distribute the code changes securely. If this is an area you're interested in, do some digging and fill some gaps in the process. Everyone would be better off.

I don't mind mascots, but I don't think this community can handle them. There's too much money and too much ignorance. It's not lighthearted anymore, it's a cultural thing. It's part of why this subreddit is terrible; nobody can actually discuss advances in cryptocurrencies and research that pertains to bitcoin because maybe, just maybe, it's an altcoin and thus is ruthlessly downvoted and dismissed. Everyone here is a cheerleader now. Team Bitcoin!
I used to hang out here all the way back in 2011, everybody saw the change happen before their eyes. The only people left are the ones stupid enough to hop on Mike's bandwagon or sadistic enough to argue against it.

No, it's about having a coherent and consensus-driven development process. Hostile forks by the few members of the core team who didn't get their way doesn't disrupt "centralization" it disrupts credibility and reliability.
Are you saying that all of the most qualified engineers opposing XT on the core team, most of which have worked on bitcoin for years, just want it to be "centralized?" What kind of bullshit argument is that?
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:40:15
False dichotomy. What precedence is there for a Bitcoin fork -- let alone a hardfork -- involving only 75% agreement? 25% is not an insignificant chunk of the hashrate.

Fun fact: In 2011 he was proposing to Satoshi that he should [take over the project]( and in 2013 he was trying to pitch the concept that development was stagnant and that [a fork was needed to fix it](
I believe he's threatened to fork bitcoin several times now. It doesn't help that he is widely regarded as one of the least trustworthy developers in the community -- the things he's said about privacy, anonymity, law enforcement, regulations and fungibility have put him in a category all on his own well before this controversy.

I don't agree with forking it. I have thought of forking it again and removing the crap and increasing the threshold, but it 1) wouldn't be adopted by hardliners, 2) would *increase* uncertainty in the best case scenario.

The only user base demanding this fork is a vocal minority on reddit. The miners aren't accepting the fork, there won't be nearly enough to get 75% to agree. The merchants definitely aren't going to put the network into the hands of less people doing far riskier things with it.
But if you think the users are on board, and that the users want a change to the protocol even if it means it will break security of the network, I think that says volumes about you guys.

It's too late. Too many of the XT supporters have been spamming downvotes and ruining this subreddit for it to be useful to discuss it at all. If it were, we could discuss it rationally and the XT supports would lose based on merit alone -- crushing dissent is a last resort that is unfortunately necessary to keep this subreddit from spiraling out of control. If you want solid discourse on the subject, start by going to the places where it's actually argued and discussed and people knowledgeable can engage with you. Places like IRC, maybe there's some niche forums/subreddits/voatwhatevers.

If the threshold were any lower it'd be hard to distinguish this from a 51% attack that coerces half of the hashrate to jump on the other chain despite disagreeing with it. I don't think the rules of the protocol should be changing through coercion.

I fear two things about an aggressive block size increase.
1. It will be very, very hard to decrease it in the future because of the fee increase, even when the advantages for decentralization are clear. We'll might screwed no matter what limit we pick -- so we need to pick a limit carefully.
2. If the block size increases like BIP101 suggests, 8x then 2x over and over again... there will be very little incentive to build, test, and deploy additional payment layers. The more we increase the block size, the more we cement the first layer into our clients, apps, exchanges, etc. creating an expectation of increasing the block size over and over to compensate.
It is well known that, at least with the technology we have now, we need additional layers built on top of Bitcoin at some point which can leverage the first layer. If we envision Bitcoin as becoming a common currency, it will not be capable of handling the load without these additional layers. We don't have to give up trust or decentralization to do it. But we do need an incentive, or it'll be like the U.S. changing credit card systems...

A lot of bitcoin's security assumes people are rational. Maybe there isn't enough of a historical example for people to make an informed decision here. Perhaps if this fork won and the currency was crushed under the weight of the consequences, future cryptocurrencies would use it as a great example of what *not* to do. Their miners might be more conservative. Their users might be less emotional.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:11:15

Keep in mind if you think XT will win: enough hashrate has come out and said they have rejected it that it wouldn't even succeed on its own. They will probably have to force it to happen with checkpoints, which would truly completely destroy Bitcoin. In the mean time, enjoy your client which removes DNS caching in favor of HTTP seeding (which conveniently hands people like Mike your node IPs even if you aren't listening or have discovery enabled!) And here's a [great list]( of changes that have nothing to do with the hard fork that Mike has shoved into XT.

Actually github recently did censor a repository because it used the word "retard" in one of its commit messages.
That being said, there's no point in bitcoin moving from github. It's written in git, like you said, we can move anytime. github has actually helped more than hurt the project -- it has pretty great workflow built in. I'm doubtful there will be a point in the near future bitcoin would actually benefit from moving from github.
Also, I really hate when people have no idea what they're talking about, tangentially relate it to network structure, then shout "but decentralization!" At least have a clue, OP.

@_date: 2015-08-17 02:04:12
Would you rather make a change that hurt the currency's security because you were too aggressive or run into the limit because you were too conservative? The essence of the development process is to err on the side of being conservative. In my opinion I highly doubt the currency will have a huge surge of adoption, especially after this fiasco. Maybe there will be a huge spike in transactions as people dump their bitcoins to avoid owning part of Mike's mess.
The core devs know what limits they're running into and how fast it's approaching. They work on a ton of other things all at the same time, as this becomes more of an issue they will focus on it entirely. They have a huge workshop next month dedicated to scalability.

The community can't moderate itself. I don't visit this subreddit much, but for years it hasn't been an actual source of interesting viewpoints or constructive dialog. That's because overly emotional, non-technical people are making vapid points, and the people who agree are upvoting. Essentially what you're asking is for this subreddit to become a popularity contest to see what's better, Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin XT.
There's a reason why this subreddit is not where actual discussion and analysis takes place on these issues. Ask yourself, aside from core devs sprinkling a few comments here and there, when was the last time you saw an engaging technical discussion here?
Everybody here is hunting to feed their bias.

I guess what he'd say is you're spending XT and Core coins simultaneously.
I understand his position to an extent. If you don't get the entire economy on board with a hardfork (both before it is merged into Core, and after the actual fork occurs), then it is considered an altcoin.
I personally think the entire altcoin thing is distracting and meaningless. I mean, look how far we've gone just to say nothing at all.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:16:44
What's the ulterior motive behind the "Bitcoin Foundation" financing Gavin, the previous manager of Core? We seemed to have been okay with giving him money at the time, so he didn't have to worry about money and could focus on working on Bitcoin. Oh hey, that's exactly what Blockstream told their experts, along with "do whatever you think is best." I don't doubt people like Greg would leave Blockstream if he were incentivized to act against his own interest.
Experts must not be cheap.
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:28:21
Not being 100% makes sense to a degree (more to account for laziness or ignorance), but we should not be making changes in which "one or two small pools" will *want* to disagree. Miners sacrifice much more by opposing or supporting things. If a change is uncontroversial but beneficial it would be in their interest to support such a change.
None of the core developers run pools. In fact the only major Bitcoin developer that still mines is gmaxwell, and it's more of a symbolic thing for him...
Personally, I'm not sure what threshold is appropriate for a hardfork. 90% is a good guess. I think a proposal which satisfies everybody could easily accomplish such an adoption percentage among miners. The community, on the other hand, will be bitterly divided regardless of the final outcome.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:08:15

There are different forms of consensus. We have developers, users and miners and they all have different motivations and experience. I don't think there is a consensus among users to move to Bitcoin XT to bypass the developers. I think there's a very powerful and vocal group of support for that option, though.
Hence, my humble opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:57:08
Having "one core dev team" is about having a coordinated process for making changes to the network. If you split that up when it's not necessary (like right now) you damage the credibility of Bitcoin and hurt its ability to adapt properly. Making a bad decision because we need to make a decision is far worse than waiting and thinking it through more if we have to. There is plenty of time left to think of a solution.
Yes, I understand people like the idea of being able to ditch the core dev team and "decentralize" but we have always had that power. Wielding it when it's necessary (like when the core dev team makes changes without consensus) is far more important.
@_date: 2015-08-22 05:34:23
It's not like anything we decide to do (including waiting to decide to do anything) is permanent. I think people are too blinded by greed to see waiting for a better decision is better than rushing into a poor one.

I clearly don't, if you read my comment:


@_date: 2015-08-16 23:47:59
When or when it isn't necessary is actually pretty objective. If there's no consensus and the core devs refuse to take action, it's not necessary. That's conservative. If there's no consensus and yet still the core devs push changes, then it's absolutely necessary to fork because they have violated their own process.
It's pretty simple. And it's not about the block size change, it's about the fork. The fork itself completely spits in the face of a process meant primarily to protect bitcoin from poor changes and decisions that cause more problems than they solve. If you have 2 people against 18 starting a fork, I think that says a lot. Especially when one of them has their own motivations to join a fork (Mike Hearn shoved his own changes into the fork that have nothing to do with the block size increase.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:30:01


Turning XT into the reference client would absolutely replace a process with 20 developers with one that only has 2, whether or not they follow core's changes. The decision-making process would be completely disjoint. (I'm not speaking about code contributions necessarily, but about engineering decisions for the protocol.)
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:33:37
Do you really think the core devs are just sitting on their ass acting passifist on this issue? They spend all this volunteer time focusing on exactly these kinds of problems. They know the needs and approaches for scalability, it's what they do all the time. They're the leading engineers and scientists in this *field*. People here have no clue what they do, but think because they read a few blog posts they're empowered and have the technical insight to oppose a large and experienced team of developers who have spent years working on Bitcoin.
How can you stand in front of people like Nick Szabo or Gregory Maxwell and act like you know what's best for bitcoin and how to accomplish it? That you know all the side-effects and that it'll be okay? And you do so while standing next to Mike Hearn of all people?
If this fork is not the death of bitcoin it will be incredibly embarrassing to look back on. I feel sorry for you that you will have to look back at your contribution to this mob.

The average block size has nothing to do with the network capacity. If you want to make a serious point here, consider first just how many flaws were fixed in order for the network to even function at the *current* block size limit.
@_date: 2015-08-23 04:18:21
Yes, a $20 blockchain fee may be perfectly reasonable. That wouldn't mean regular users would be paying $20 transaction fees.
In LN, the users pay a *much* smaller fee per transaction and there are far less transactions that need to touch the blockchain. It will be much more rare to actually send a transaction over the blockchain, thus allowing the block size limit to decrease and the fees to increase. Mind you, without losing the trust model.
Keep in mind, we have no idea what fees would be necessary to support the network. Mining incentives are complex.
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:58:07
A better website would tell us exactly how outnumbered XT is on the *fork*, including how many *experts* agree (practically few), or how much hashrate has announced support of it (practically none), or how many merchants/payment processors support it. Those are all the people that make the decision; even if a bunch of redditors install XT, exchanges and the rest of them can ignore you.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:50:57
Obsolescence isn't an option being considered, except in the eyes of alarmists. Being conservative and making the best decision is. That involves a way higher standard of simulation, planning and design than what Gavin/Mike have proposed.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:00:23
Majority != consensus, as I'm sure you know. If a vast majority of the users did support this fork, that is broad consensus. It's not true that a vast majority of users support this fork -- the ones that even know it's happening, anyway.
Hell, this plan does not even require a vast majority of miners to support it. 75% is not consensus of miners. That's a few huge pools making a decision. Or, viewed another way, one small pool (or dozens of them) being *ignored*. 25% is enough to execute a selfish mining attack. It's not an insignificant chunk of the mining reward and thus a huge incentive to make a good decision. We've never (intentionally) implemented forks based on such a small percentage of the hashrate. If something is such a good idea for the currency that we're willing to fork it, it should have more than 75% support from the people who directly stand to profit from it.
But the point isn't even the miner and user consensus. **That's not what my post was talking about.** I'm talking about a decision-making process being abandoned because it is not aggressive enough. The consensus of our engineers is being dismissed by unqualified people deferring to a much smaller, controversial team with changes not everybody is convinced are a good idea. This is what is very scary.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:08:34
The decision to create a fork is not the end of the debate. It's still up to the users/miners to accept the fork and install/implement the XT client, as I indicated in my post. I'm not speaking to the developers right now.

@_date: 2015-08-19 14:55:09
I personally think a *temporary* limit increase would be far better. We probably wouldn't run bump into the new limit anyway, and it would give us time to work on Lightning and other scalability projects without encumbering us permanently with an unsustainable increase in the limit. And it would get people like Hearn and Andresen off our backs, as their main argument is that the capacity limit will be hit soon.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:09:34
You can vote by using and mining with bitcoin core, but if a fork takes place of this magnitude the currency would be hurt badly.

@_date: 2015-08-18 22:48:22
Why would a large mining pool veto the decision if it's good for the currency? This is a ridiculous assumption. It also implies that the voices of dozens of smaller pools should be ignored, so it fails the "other side" of the test for fairness.
75% is not a consensus when half the network was found to be SPV mining. And no, none of my "fears" were addressed in Gavin's blog. Gavin's posts, and the rest of the PR campaign behind XT, has essentially dismissed my "fears" by claiming there are no counter-arguments or that the facts aren't disputed, which isn't true at all.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:39:43
sipa said it best: a consensus network is a consensus system, not a democracy. Get everybody to agree, or don't do it.
The entire point of Bitcoin's consensus system is to get everybody to agree to the state of the blockchain. That one half of the hashrate could outpace the other half is the threat that forces each side to settle on the other side's interpretation of the blockchain. **This is provided by the protocol rules themselves.** It would be very dangerous if we turned the protocol rules into a majoritarian system, when it has always been a consensus system.
75% is not a consensus at all. In fact, if only 25% of the network started running Not-BitcoinXT (pretending to support BitcoinXT to force a premature fork) it would destroy this hostile fork, which is not a difficult percentage to get on board. If anything, there is an incentive, because BitcoinXT supporting miners are advertising that they can be forcefully orphaned. That is only *part* of what makes 75% a shitty threshold for consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:26:18

@_date: 2015-08-18 18:32:55


There is not substantial evidence that XT's plan truly mirrors technological growth. In fact, it could reduce scalability and security options in the future if it is too optimistic. And I'm not sure the simulations and models used to justify the figures he picked are complete and many holes have been pointed out in them.
You are right though, and there is very little disagreement on the issue of actually raising the block size limit. The contention is that raising it now is *aggressive* when we don't fully understand the consequences on network security and decentralization, when there are better options being explored, and when our tools and simulations are improving in this area.


Regardless of the definition of "consensus" among the core developers, it's clear there is not a "near-unanimous" agreement on the path forward among experts. There are only two individuals I know (Gavin and Mike) with any credibility in the community who are advocating for this fork. I have yet to see another expert, on the core team or not, who believes this fork is a good idea.
If you're someone who was swayed by Mike and Gavin's PR campaign, ask yourself why almost all of the rest of the experts in our community who have spent years working on Bitcoin say NO to this fork. Then ask yourself how much you really know about Bitcoin's technology and the risks to network security that arise out of increasing the block size limit.


Experts cost a lot, so this ventures on conspiracy theory territory. The individuals on the core team still have enormous financial interest in Bitcoin in the event that there is a conflict of interest. I highly doubt these reputable people, who are given enormous deference by their employers to act in a way that is best for the network, are scheming to destroy it. They are far more experienced and knowledgeable than Mike, that is *clear*.


Why should it be okay for patches that have nothing to do with the hardfork be included in XT? They benefit Mike and his vision of the changes that should be made, so he is effectively hijacking this opportunity already to force his ideas on the currency. I implore everyone to actually look at [the list]( and wonder why some of these weren't included in Core.


This is true, but it's actually very concerning. The precedent for future decisions on controversial issues could be set by this entire situation: we may live in a future where Bitcoin's development is unreliable, uncoordinated, and complicated technical issues are decided through politics. Yes, you got to reaffirm that the "community owns the protocol" and that the developers can't push you around, but you've done so by being aggressive with changes the core developers are trying to be conservative about and reach consensus on.
And you've done so despite not having the community behind you, which is NOT the standard we should seek for protocol changes.

I proceeded to give several explanations why the "centralization risk" of a development team is non-existent.
Mining pools are worse, but we aren't treating it as a serious problem for some of the same reasons that we're rushing to increase the block size: most people here don't give a shit about decentralization, they just want a payment network. I think few understand what sets Bitcoin apart from any other payment network is the decentralization. (And additionally, that decentralization is necessary for Bitcoin's security model to function.)
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:41:18
This is Mike misrepresenting the situation. The alternative isn't that "it shouldn't exist at all" but that more work should be done to avoid the potential negatives or find another option. It's like bloom filters. He forced the issue on that, despite everyone saying "let's try to wait and think about it some more" What do we discover afterward? That there are better technical options than bloom filters (especially for privacy), and we would have been much better off waiting.
If something is not well motivated, if it does not clear code review, and if it does not appear to jive well with mathematics, it's a potential problem. Mike has a history of trying to shove through dangerous or poorly-reasoned patches into Bitcoin Core. Some of them have hurt privacy, others have caused unintentional hardforks. Introducing aggressive changes to Bitcoin, a monetary system which should have some semblance of stability, is reckless.
Wladmir once said to Mike in the PR for his Tor blacklist stuff:


I think his experience of operating centralized software and networks at Google doesn't give him a good perspective of how to develop something like Bitcoin.

I agree that the censorship only made the discourse worse, but I think that's only because it was enforced terribly. Before the censorship took place, people were still very ignorant and very tempered on this topic. Now that the damage is done, the only option really is to purge the advocates of this fork from this subreddit and the kind of people who make this subreddit a living hell. There are other places for them to congregate. No half measures.

The proponents of small blocks are only concerned with raising it *now* when there's no plan in place to actually keep the system functioning and decentralized when it reaches those higher block size limits. Raising it is not just changing a number, all sorts of things can break. Things have been breaking for years at the current limit. Increasing it eightfold and then continuing to increase it yearly would be an unsustainable rate of change in the protocol, when already there are problems. About half of miners aren't even full nodes, they're SPV mining, which makes this fork even dumber for choosing 75% as a threshold.
If the block size limit increases in a way that does not mirror the actual capacity of the network, we'll run into other limits or sacrifice the security the network needs to function. This is why other solutions are being developed and the core team has decided to temporarily wait while those solutions and that research takes place. Decisions can still be made but rushing into a fork is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:00:04
Off-chain solutions don't have to be decentralized, but even if they are "centralized", they aren't necessary for interacting with the network, nor would they require trust.

The mods aren't deleting your comments if you say "XT." They're just banning idiots (like you) who make the discussions here awful. Turns out that's a lot of XT proponents.
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:52:36
I don't think you read my post carefully. I clearly stated "We should also never embrace the concept of a hostile hard fork to force changes without consensus." The fork itself is not the problem. It's that people are embracing it as a good idea. It's not.
Consensus is not a democracy. Consensus implies near-unanimous agreement. The language analogy doesn't work -- very few things behave like a decentralized cryptocurrency, so I dislike analogies like this. We don't need analogies to discuss the problem.
In the scenario that XT succeeded, it would do so 1) without consensus among miners, 2) without consensus among experts, and 3) without consensus among the community. It is expressly designed for this scenario. Regardless of what you think of a block size increase, that is unacceptable, and should have been met with ridicule from the community. It violates *the fundamental principle* that gives bitcoin any credibility: people expect the economic and security properties of the network to be *preserved* through changes.
It is the same reason why changing the 21 million coin limit would destroy Bitcoin's credibility. If the rules change because a majority coerces a minority into living with the changes, the currency is no longer reliable in any sense, as there's no guarantee that any of its properties are considered immutable. Credibility is a very subjective thing but it doesn't take much of a stretch to understand this concept.

@_date: 2015-08-17 14:43:18
Watching the most constructive and enlightening comments (like yours) be ruthlessly downvoted indicates exactly the kind of mentality Mike has brought into the community.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:24:14
I wouldn't be surprised if your actions pushing for this fork destroyed growth more than hitting the limit would. I think you know that the other core devs take scalability seriously as well and want to see a block size limit increase if it can be sustained. I think you know it can't be sustained with the current technology without threatening decentralization more than it already has -- you just care far less about decentralization. I think you know the tools and simulations right now are half-baked and were even worse a year ago. I think you know this fork is a good opportunity to shove your changes and desires into the fork, which you have already done.
I just don't think you understand the damage a hostile fork like this can wreak on Bitcoin. Imagine the fork won with only 75% miner consensus. That would practically split the community apart, but more importantly, would bypass an engineering process designed to prevent aggressive changes to the currency. It would give into alarmism and highly discourage participation in its development by the people most qualified to do so. It would undermine the credibility of the currency, because it would no longer have a reliable process of changing. It would show its participants that its decision-making process is unreliable. It would show future reference client developers if they don't get their way, they can just threaten a fork and launch a huge PR campaign.
This campaign for the fork is another damaging part of your proposal. The amount of people who know very little about how the tech works in our community is staggering; I've seen it first hand in the reddit comments, and I'm sure all of the developers behind bitcoin understand just how ignorant the community is on this subject. It's why you've had to spoon-feed them your opinion and fears. It's led to a toxic culture that is rejecting discourse and the core developers and setting a new standard for the kind of developers we want and the kind of users we want in the future.
I can't think of a single way in which this fork is helpful. You're in the minority of a large group of experienced developers who care more about security than they do about projected fears and hypothetical growth spurts. You know better than anyone that you are one of the least trusted developers in the entire community -- you've read the posts on bitcointalk for years. It's unfortunate that this is the legacy that you and Gavin want to leave for your contributions to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:32:31
It's not just developers disagreeing. Users will go with whichever plan they think helps their own interests (which happen to include the currency itself). We usually defer to qualified engineers on that point because deciding what will help the currency more is a difficult question.
It may be a good idea to ditch developers sometimes, but ditching developer consensus is a whole other game.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:15:44
No, don't you see. Let's turn on people like Gregory Maxwell, probably the most knowledgeable person on cryptocurrency if you've ever read the things he writes and the research he has done. There must be a conspiracy.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:55:01
This isn't a government system. This is a decentralized consensus network. The point is having everybody agree. The only sense in not requiring 100% support is that some miners might be lazy or ignorant of the situation. Even that is being generous.
It's also not difficult to get all miners to agree on something. They, unlike perhaps this community, act slightly more rational because of the substantial financial interest.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:45:02
I'm glad we're able to fork and move away from the developers if necessary, but this particular fork is a huge step backwards for the entire community.
1. Next time there are technical disputes, instead of a coordinated process for changing the protocol, there will a forced political decision made by the users. The block size issue is a perfect example of why that's not a good idea; very few of the people you expect to "vote" for this realize the negatives that come with raising the block size limit, and appear to be ignoring the vast amount of technical expertise in the community. This fork will set a nasty precedent for solving future disputes.
2. The threat of a fork that doesn't require an actual consensus (something just short of "all miners agree") is unprecedented, and creates uncertainty. It sets the stage for future forks that require just as much agreement in the community.
3. If a fork *did* succeed it would force out all of the best engineers and researchers we have in our community, setting the standard for the replacement developers. After all, look at the bullying and accusations the core dev team have had to deal with for a week. Despite working hard keeping Bitcoin safe and decentralized, their job is totally thankless.
4. Looming uncertainty itself over the trajectory of the fork and what process exactly coordinates action will upset people's faith in the protocol and the basic guarantees of the network.
Basically, the fork is all negatives and no positives.

There are worse things in Bitcoin XT.
Hearn decided to shove his Lighthouse modifications into the fork, taking advantage of this situation to advance his own ideas that have nothing to do with the blocksize increase. They're also adding a number of other patches that don't require a hardfork. One of them changes the way the inventory system polls for transactions I believe -- that's a part of the code that is not to be taken lightly.

@_date: 2015-09-01 19:52:15
It's not a distortion of Mike's message... he believes it's actually safe and responsible for the currency to hard fork without widespread approval. He thinks consensus is democracy. He's wrong on both points.
He has the freedom to fork bitcoin. You have the freedom to use his fork.
We also have the freedom to tell you why the fork is a bad idea. Deal with it.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:08:29
We've been talking about it for a while, yes, but only recently have we assembled the kinds of simulations and tools necessary to make good decisions and study the effects of our changes. We've learned a lot about the design process of the protocol, riskiness of certain actions, and so the conversation is really entering an important period of productivity.
We didn't know that much about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies five years ago. This has been a very active field, I don't think pretending like this issue was thoroughly debated for years is a fair characterization.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:08:36
It's because this is written for people who aren't that knowledgeable about Bitcoin's internals and who aren't experienced with its development process. It's not an argument for anything. It's a plea for caution, and it's a statement of position by a large number of developers. This draws lines in the sand.
If you want a technical discussion about this stuff there are a lot better places to do it. I think it's unlikely we'll see idiots like you there, though.

The lightning network is just one example of a trustless layer built on top of bitcoin which leverages invariants provided by the layer below it. If you use lightning, you are not at risk of losing your money. It wouldn't be possible to build such a network without the blockchain to support it.

@_date: 2015-09-01 21:01:42
Bitcoin is high risk because even now we don't fully understand how secure it is or stable it can be over the long-term. Its economics are not well understood and its price is incredibly volatile compared to most other "currencies." Bitcoin is still under development.
It's exactly because of this that we should be conservative, to avoid introducing even more uncertainty and riskiness to the system -- especially when so many people depend on the way it works right now.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:37:08
Part of the problem is that you're seeing it like a compromise, like this is some sort of debt ceiling debate. We all lose if we break the economic and security properties of the network. The only argument being made is not to raise it without thinking about all of the downsides and taking action which is least likely to hurt us in the long run.
Caution and conservative decision making is what is being put forward here, not a proposal for a block size change. In fact the article went through great effort to show that discussion about technical decisions is ongoing and will be pursued heavily over the course of the next several months.
We'd be lucky if we hit the limit anytime soon at our current growth rates. Why do you feed into this alarmist bullshit? How embarrassed will you be when XT fails and you've effectively demonstrated to the world your impatience and poor judgment? How does it feel to side with Mike Hearn of all people, the one least trusted and the one who has consistently demonstrated he does not care at all about privacy or decentralization, against virtually everyone else who is orders of magnitude more qualified and experienced in the development of Bitcoin?
It boggles the mind to see how someone could be so stupid and insistent.

@_date: 2015-09-02 18:40:50
Doing nothing isn't an option that has been considered. It's the default nature of the network. We've only "done nothing" when network growth exceeds capacity, something we know will not even happen in the next year or so. We have plenty of time to come up with the best decision we can come up with.
Everything is still on the table. There are merely alarmists which have turned a routine technical matter into a political one -- and so the community appears to have injected its own opinions and impatience into a concern the core devs are perfectly capable of figuring out.
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:34:53
Of course we won't have absolute certainty. The goal is to pick the best option and not a moment too soon.

@_date: 2015-09-02 18:34:49
There are too many assumptions in your comment, you've practically said nothing but parroted pro-XT points.


Assurance contracts, and just because the lightning network exists doesn't mean there is no use for the blockchain. How would you create or settle channels otherwise? And the number of other things the lightning network cannot do? I think you're really stretching here -- we don't even know how much network security should cost.
It's also not a contentious shift in philosophy. The idea that Bitcoin -- a p2p flood network which achieves global consensus every 10 minutes on average -- could possibly support arbitrarily high transaction rates without sacrificing decentralization is just a fact of life. Satoshi in his whitepaper and his statements made it very clear building these instruments on top of bitcoin would be very valuable for the network.
Further, I don't understand your point. Should we prohibit the lightning network from existing because then allegedly nobody would use the blockchain? Hint: we can't. And since we cannot make a finite resource (network capacity) scale enough to destroy decentralization, we eventually need to use another layer. The first layer will not necessarily be always affordable.

The dispute over BIP101 is whether the growth rate it picks is a good one, not whether or not it's continuous. If you didn't know BIP101 had linear growth, you probably didn't even read the BIP.
BIP101 assumes a certain growth pattern that is acceptable and necessary for the network. The point in accepting something like BIP100 is that it would prevent the limit from raising unless it became necessary, and it would make the limit easier to raise with certain restrictions over how large it can raise or lower. This makes comparing the "smoothness" of one proposal vs. another nonsensical.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:05:27
Calling Mike Hearn untrustworthy is not a character attack, it's a statement of fact. It's not like I pulled that out of my ass as some sort of anecdote. His positions and ideas have been well discussed and he's had a long history of dismissing the importance of privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin.
I challenge you to lend him any credibility. I can't even do that with his core contributions, as he's practically done nothing positive for Core ever.

Not only is there more to the debate, this graph is utterly misrepresenting things. You're going to get idiots going "wow look at BIP101 it looks so smooth" which is a complete failure to demonstrate the actual intention of any of the proposals.
* This graph is like saying a bike is faster than a car because the car might go down a bunch of crazy roads for no reason. The graph totally invents an imaginary scenario where the block size increases and decreases for no reason. Decreases are almost certainly going to be less likely at first and become more likely as time goes on.
* One of the upsides to BIP100 is its flexibility to change as needed, which this graph could not possibly show because the proposals are **totally different concepts**.
* The graph is titled "max block size growth" yet neither of the BIP100 lines represent this at all. The OP has turned an inequality into two horses and compared it to a lake.
The goal here isn't to make the graph look pretty anyway. What an all around shitty post.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:23:47
The "consensus" we're talking about is a computer science term, not a political science one. Bitcoin is a *consensus system*, which we usually associate with the concept of everybody agreeing. That we don't expect 100% is only in anticipation of some small amount of people forgetting to upgrade.
That kind of strict, near-unanimous approach to protocol changes is what keeps any semblance of credibility in the system. If we're going to shove changes through with 75% attacks there's no telling what else we'll change on majoritarian whims. I for one would lose all faith in Bitcoin the instant it changes in such a hostile way. Even if all the miners back a proposal, so long as most of the credible experts don't I will find it unacceptable.
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:20:52
A high threshold for moving changes into core is good. Plenty of major changes take place on a regular basis, just look at the BIPs and pull requests.
If we don't accept BIP100, was it because we "submitted a BIP and argued about it forever?" No, it's because we don't want it or think there's a better option. There are too many edge cases in code like this. Bitcoin is a very complicated mess of crypto, game theory, economics and distributed architecture. You don't just shove changes through a system like that, especially when there's an expectation of stability and billions of dollars on the line.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:50:13
It *is* being constrained by the state of technology, which is why there is so much resistance to moving it up in the first place. That's the point of an upper bound in my description. *We* set the ceiling, not the miners. We tell the miners what the acceptable floor and ceiling is, and ask them to make good decisions about raising it within those bounds.
The alternative (BIP101) would be the same but less flexible: we also ask the miners (*less* of them, mind you) to decide, but only ONCE, *in advance of the change*, on a single growth rate that we're not sure will reflect reality. BIP100 is a strictly better option.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:16:28
No, it's absolutely not. 75% is still somewhat controversial. And that's just *miners*. Imagine the people in the industry, the users, the developers who would disagree. It just so happens that is also an overwhelming amount of them.
If we come up with a proposal that's actually a good idea and reasoned well, it will not be controversial. If it's not controversial it should be trivial to get it past a much higher threshold of support in our community, as we've done before.
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:25:49
No, Mike is just incredibly annoying pretty much everywhere he goes. In PR's all he does is turn the discussion into a pissing contest and ignores/deflects technical criticism into personal attacks. He has really only proposed ideas that turn out to be toxic or risky. And he pushes them really, really hard.

Gavin and Mike are unlikely to sign this letter. They don't actually believe in any of its contents, such as the concept of consensus. I think it says a lot more about them than it does about the core devs.

Many of us who hold BTC don't want it changed by alarmists and populists. We want it changed based on sound technical reasons and widespread consensus. We don't want it to change if it means breaking its economic or security guarantees.
Acting as though this is such a pressing need that we should sacrifice everything and force something through without consensus among the industry and experts is fear-based development.
You are part of the problem. We'd be better off if people like you left, dumped your bitcoins and found an altcoin to soil.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:19:12
This is such a stupid comment.
Miners are being asked to decide the result by *both proposals*. BIP100 in theory is more flexible and will result in only changing the block size when necessary, as opposed to BIP101 which *assumes* the growth rate up front and forces it despite it potentially not being necessary or being dangerous for decentralization.
If proper bounds are given to BIP100 then miners' authority on the subject is limited by what we consider tolerable. If miners deciding the block size increase under those conditions is unacceptable to some degree, we simply narrow the bounds.
@_date: 2015-09-01 23:40:25


Yes, if there were no upper bound, which is the point of my comment. If we implement a BIP which raises the block size to N bytes anyway, what's the harm in BIP100 with a cap of N?

Have you even read the mailing lists or any of their comments here on reddit? Are you ever on IRC participating in this discussion? It would be clear to you, if you had any experience with Bitcoin, that there are too many places where it can fail, where it has failed and we didn't expect it. There are so many weird game theoretical interactions, so many edge cases and unforseen attacks, that just changing the protocol willy nilly is not a good idea *ever*.
Something you didn't learn as a "PhD in CS" are [software development processes]( apparently.
And again, the idiocy behind this comment:


You don't understand this debate or even the letter. It isn't an argument that it shouldn't be raised. It's a claim that we shouldn't raise it yet without thinking of every possible downside and picking the best option. There is no deadline for action -- especially when "action" can destroy everything Bitcoin stands for if it is poorly reasoned enough.

I remind you nothing I've said in the comment you replied to is even disputed by Gavin. So, what's the next worthless retort you will come up with next?
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:03:57
I don't understand this argument at all.
If BIP100 becomes bounded below the upper bound given by another proposal, even one like BIP101, how exactly would miners have "control" in this situation which would negatively affect network centralization? Their only influence would be *not* raising the limit when it's actually necessary -- which could come at the expense of the value of the coins they are mining and the hardware they have researched and built. In that case, centralization risk is not created at all.
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:08:50
We can increase the blocksize limit, but this comment tree is talking about whether it can just be effectively unlimited and still be scalable. We know it can't be without throwing decentralization in the trash.
A high blocksize limit creates a lower bound on the bandwidth requirements of full nodes, not just miners. In order to be a *validating full node* you eventually would need to have fast internet connectivity or more, which is not conducive to decentralization. That's the entire point of bitcoin, to be **trustless** and decentralized. We can't achieve trustless if it costs too much to run a full node.
Right *now* a lot of regular people can't even run full nodes, which is unacceptable. You seem to revel in the fact decentralization is now an afterthought.
