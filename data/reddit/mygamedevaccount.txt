The claim wasn't that "currency isn't an asset", it was that "Bitcoin isn't a currency".

I think the implication in the OP was that channel sales should be trustless and atomic, like every other LN transaction.
Not sure how that'd work, but maybe someone cleverer than me can chip in with an idea.

Isn't it obvious that technical analysis in general is bullshit?
I mean, I guess it's not obvious or people wouldn't keep doing it.

There's no maker fee on gdax, so just set up a limit sell and you won't pay any fees

SPV clients can't verify that blocks are valid. They can verify the proof of work and therefore select the highest difficulty chain, and they can verify that a block contains a given transaction. They can't verify that:
* The transaction's inputs are unspent (they just trust that the node that relayed the block to them wouldn't have accepted said block if they weren't)
* They have been told about all the transactions that are relevant to them
It's also very difficult to scale SPV. Here's a pretty detailed article explaining why: 


I use Bitcoin Core for hot funds and a piece of paper for cold funds.

If you don't have the resources to run a full node then you can't verify that miners are even producing valid blocks without trusting a third party. And if you have to trust a third party then the system isn't decentralised.

Miners might want to hedge their exposure to BTC price movements in order to guarantee that their profit exceeds their power cost, even if BTC experiences a correction. Selling futures contracts allows them to do that.
Of course, if everyone is 100% certain that BTC will go up then there's no point in selling futures on it. But nobody's 100% certain.

Uh... it's a candle that's green.

Both the CBOE and CME futures will be settled in USD, not BTC. Could you maybe reformulate your point with that knowledge taken into account?

Not everyone who uses futures markets is a speculator. Futures contracts are very useful for risk management.
I can see BTC mining operations, exchanges and merchants all benefiting from a properly regulated futures market.

That for loop is equivalent to `start *= Math.pow(1.0021, 730)` btw

Of course we do.
Here's what said:
1. Holding your BCH position rather than selling it costs nothing because "you got them for free"
2. Holding both BTC and BCH is "the perfect 1-1 hedge"
3. Holding both BTC and BCH makes your investment "basically risk-free"
None of those things are true.

Yeah, probably. It's actually [happened before]( but the market recovered afterwards.
The difference is, if you own your keys you own your BTC, and you can just hold it until the market calms down. If your exchange has your keys and they go bust, you lose it all.

If you lose $800 worth of stuff, you've lost $800 worth of stuff. It doesn't matter if you got that stuff for free, you've still lost $800 worth of stuff.
