My dad has always been someone who will never risk any money, he liked a bank full of fiat. 
Today after about a year of me explaining bitcoin and crypto is general, he has finally bought some bitcoin! I’ve never told him to buy some, I just explained bitcoin pros and cons. 
This isn’t mass adoption but people are starting to open their eyes, my dad isn’t the start of this but it’s a sign that someone who doesn’t like change or the unknown would consider the possibility of bitcoin and crypto. 
Tulip was a bubble. Come on it’s a tulip. Bitcoin is a tech of the next generation

This is why bitcoin hasn’t crashed at ALL! It’s 4K higher then what is was a year ago. We had a huge pump for a month or 2. But it’s still on course for a good few years, sorry to anyone who joined in December but patience wins
