Obviously jstolfi wants Bitcoin destroyed. He's open about it and invests a lot of time into destroying it. He's also the top commenter at rbtc.

Yes, Bitcoin has cancer. That cancer is BU and the rbtc'ers. It's past time to treat it. Compromise with cancer is not a treatment.
I no longer want to share the same community or coin with rbtc or the BU pushers. They've spread vicious lies and conspiracy theories for well over a year now. Compromise? No. Everyone has a breaking point, and for me, this post was it:
There is no room for compromise with vermin who post things like that.
Now the rbtc'ers are crying about nasty posts about Roger Ver. When we get to their level of nastiness, they'll know it.

Miners delaying segwit is annoying, but certainly not cancerous. I do claim "rbtc'ers are the problem" and I think the one link of evidence I gave supports the claim. It looks likely to me that some of them will turn violent in real life when they realize they're failing to hijack bitcoin. They should be avoided.
I'm not exaggerating by calling them cancer. If anything, I'm downplaying how insidious and dangerous they are.

Obama looks sad in that picture.

I don't understand this post, but generally I think it's a good idea to keep this kind of drama off of the r/bitcoin subreddit. But Ver and the others definitely need to be called out. Consider posting it to r/BGTOW instead. That's where a lot of the posts about the recent doxxing drama were.
I just found an example of rbtc'ers upvoting a comment with Nazi propaganda. Since it's not really bitcoin-related, I posted about it in r/BGTOW instead of here:

I took screenshots of the whole thread while it was active. I don't want to spread the dox, so I blacked out the link in the post. Also there was a dox in one of the reddit comments (by [redacted]). I blacked out all proper names in that comment (except "Trump"). [Edit: redacted username of offending commenter]
Here's a screenshot of the original post, linking to a website with the dox:
Note that this same link had been posted a week earlier by u/ProHashing, who has now been banned from reddit, presumably for doxing.
Here is an early comment by Ver confirming that he believes saying the name of u/theymos does not qualify as doxing. Someone else warns him that reddit admins may not see it this way. (There were many other comments warning Ver.)
Here is a comment from me confirming to him that u/ProHashing had posted this before and was banned from reddit. (Ver should be aware of this, since ProHashing has written on his blog about contacting Ver about the issue.)
Here is a (redacted) comment from the thread directly doxing theymos. It was up for 8 hours when I took this screenshot, so it was a clear decision to allow it.
Finally 12 hours after Ver made the post, another mod u/Mandrik0 added a comment confirming the post was doxing and needed to be removed:
Shortly thereafter the post was removed from the listing on the relevant subreddit.

I think ECDSA is *known* to be vulnerable to quantum attacks. If I'm reading u/giszmo correctly, the new information is that ECDSA may be vulnerable *without* quatum computing. If so, this is major news, and there need to be contingency plans under discussion ASAP.
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:17:41
He could appeal it and get it reversed. I don't think he had a good case though. He knew posting the link was already considered a dox when he reposted it.
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:55:45
Yes, u/ProHashing was banned. And his banning happened shortly after he started linking to his forum doxing theymos. ProHashing has an explicit campaign to dox theymos. Thanks for posting about this issue. I've been pushing the issue a lot myself lately (see my history).

I haven't been this happy since my wedding day. Well, that probably doesn't say much good about my marriage.

Never tell your wife about your bitcoins. If your wife knows, your wife's lawyer will know.

It's tough for someone to ban their boss.
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:35:51
One of his mods removed it, because it was obviously against reddit's rules. The bigger problem is that Ver was reposting a link that had already been judged to be against the rules, and was informed of this before reposting it.
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:35:22
I'm glad you removed the post, and glad Roger didn't remove you as a mod over the issue. It's a shame it was up for 12 hours though, and that a specific doxing comment (not even requiring clicking through to a link) was allowed for 8 hours. To be honest, I think Roger knew the post was doxing (due to the same post the week before) and decided to do it to see how far he could go and get away with it. ProHashing claims he contacted Ver multiple times about the issue.

Unfortunately, it looks like we were wrong about this.

If "Dave" can crack the password, others can. The bitcoin was safely spent yesterday. We might learn how difficult the password is to crack when the bcash or shit vision moves. Both are still at the addresses.

This exact comment, word for word, was posted on this thread by both u/squarepush3r and u/swternki. It seems likely that either these two users are sock puppets or that both users belong to the same team of people trying to defend Jihan and BU. In either case, "their" opsec is as buggy as BU's code.
Edit: It appears this happened because u/swternki is (probably) a bot doing karma farming by copying other people's comments, in this case the comment of u/squarepush3r. Sorry for accusing u/squarepush3r.

I also assumed it was you (u/squarepush3r) sockpuppetting. But I agree that the explanation of a bot karma farming makes more sense. I also apologize for accusing you.

Well, I'm sure you wouldn't say that unless you'd run some statistical analysis over swatting cases and information about contentious online debates and concluded there's no corrolation. So, thanks! I'm much more relaxed now.

Many of us have seen years worth of nasty comments on forums directed at Core devs, sometimes rising to the level of actual threats. I wouldn't call that "ZERO information."
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:15:48
It's not about whether something is or is not true, but whether it is less or more likely to be true, given limited information.
The Trump comparison is strange. He obviously has much better tools at his disposal than swatting. If someone swatted one of Trump's kids, it would be more likely to be a vocal Trump opponent (probably in antifa) than a random person. This seems obvious to me, but hey, maybe I'm just living under some delusion that things mean things and not everything is random.
Did a random NBC exec get swatted last week? I didn't hear about it if it happened.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:52:06
I appreciate what you do. Just try to stay safe and realistic about potential dangers. I'm sure there a lot of your supporters who'd be willing to play the role of Hitchens if you needed to go Rushdie for a while.

Does that mean spending USD is economically equivalent to buying BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:33:00
First, I'm very sorry to hear this happened to Jameson, and relieved the story wasn't worse.
Having said that, I think this is a good moment for us to recognize some realities. There are some very disturbed people out there, and some of them are involved in this "blocksize debate." An example is a post from 9 months ago essentially threatening the Core maintainer:
If that seems like atypical, I recommend you spend a little time looking at the abusive comments directed at u/nullc and u/luke-jr on a certain subreddit.
With a bit of internet searching I could easily find an example of someone who used to write for a cryptonews website and who has also been accused of swatting various bloggers. The same person was later fired from the cryptonews website because he used nefarious means to steal the domain name of a different site (coinfire) as part of the whole GAW saga.
There's even a story about Hal Finney being swatted by someone seeking bitcoins.
I don't know the stats, but my impression is that people who use swatting tend to get away with it, even when the victim has a good idea of who did it.
Be careful. If possible, be anonymous. I can admire people who are public about controversial topics. Charb of Charlie Hebdo didn't try to hide his identity. I admire that. We know how that ended. He was brutally murdered. And even though people pretended to be upset about it, the truth is that no one is publishing similar caricatures anymore. Let's be realistic here. Some core devs could be murdered by similar fanatics. Survivors in the aftermath could claim *Je Suis Charlie*. And 2X could quietly kill Bitcoin, in the silence that follows from cowardice.
In other words, far more Core devs should be anonymous.

That's Amity Shlaes. She wrote an excellent book *The Forgotten Man* about the Great Depression era. It's good to read this kind of tweet from a well-informed mainstream voice.

I'm sure you can understand why I'm not inclined to share any personal information with you at all, especially in a thread like this.
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:13:00
I also doubt BU will really gain the kind of traction to actually HF. If I'm wrong and they do, I'll also go along with a switch to Core with a new mining algorithm.

You're just making it clearer that you have no familiarity with the alt right. The alt right openly mock Peterson.
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:20:29
An easy way to distinguish between the modern left and modern right is to ask about the blues.
People on the left hate the blues because they think the blues are whites oppressing non-whites.
People on the right hate the blues because they think the blues are non-whites oppressing whites.
Incidentally, my impression is that the alt-right hates Peterson. They think he's bluish.
