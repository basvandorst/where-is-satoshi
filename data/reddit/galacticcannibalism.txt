Etherum is a shit coin back by a large marketing campaign that's shoving it down everyone's throat. The legitimacy of this graphic went down the toilet with this speculation at the end—should have stuck to "cryptocurrency". Bitcoin is more successful considering the market cap and track record. This graphic is an example of blatant, unapologetic propaganda, that Ethereum engages in. 
This reminds me of some religious pamphlet that has good points but then suddenly goes off the deep end stating how the spaghetti monster is responsible for everything.

Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

Nope, still taxable:
**Are ETH/cryptocurrency gains taxable?**
Yes. The [IRS treats virtual currency \(such as cryptocurrency\) as property]( That means if you sell ETH, BTC, or any other cryptocurrency that has **appreciated in value**, you have realized a capital gain and must pay taxes on this income. If you held the position for one year or less, it is a short-term capital gain which is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. If you held the position for more than one year, it is a long-term capital gain which is taxed at your long-term capital gains tax rate. In most cases, this is 15%, but could also be 0% or 20% depending on your specific ordinary income tax bracket.

Bitcoin won't have to handle all the transactions in the world because that would mean the government isn't in control. They literally will not let that happend—they've killed leaders and waged wars with leaders trying to do the same. The government needs to control the money supply to some extent to 'control' their populace. Aka we'll have bigger issues on our hands if it could scale to that level.
Bitcoin will exist in parallel with government fiat acting as a hedge not displacing an entire system. It's a chaos barometer. The more insanity in our economy the stronger a system that governed by sound math will grow. You're naive to think otherwise.

It's really simple, people who can't do the math and realize on chain fees can be amortized will create a centralized ponzi scheme that can be censored, shut down, and have payments blocked/frozen/money seized because they have no grasp of reality. Anytime a node is 'in a data center' you're handing over the FUCKING CREDIBILITY.
You do realize thats why BTC was created was because the MONEY SUPPLY was being manipulated right? If you can't validate the money supply(node), then BCH or a protocol with large blocks can be perverted and used against the poor and downtrodden IDENTICALLY to the way fiat is.
I don't know how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb.. I’d love to see the BCH/similar large blck network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for BCH. Large blocks without the proper upgrades in place like segwit/LN is scaling irresponsibly. 
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
This is a poor design decision because it WILL get FILLED almost instantly. Increasing the block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there are only companies running the nodes then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not.

Sure thing.
* the idea that you can only use an LN channel to transact with a small number of 'certain people' is incorrect. You can transact with anyone else connected to the network.
* the idea that on-chain fees (i.e. to open/close LN channels) will remain at the current ridiculous levels is an unreasonable assumption that ignores all the scaling currently in progress to combat that very problem
* the idea that channels would be regularly opened/closed is incorrect - most people would keep their channel(s) open indefinitely
There is no 'locking up'. This is FUD spread by those who don't like LN as a scaling solution.
If you take money out of your bank account and put it in your wallet, would you consider that 'locking it up'? No, you're actually making your money more usable.
With BTC in a wallet, you can make payments via the blockchain (slow, requires non-neglible fees, requires confirmations, not very private). With BTC in LN, you can make cheap, instant, more private payments to anyone on the LN network (which, at least theoretically, will be anyone with bitcoin).
If for some reason you need your BTC back in a standard wallet, you just transfer it back with a regular bitcoin transaction. You'd only really need to send money back to a regular wallet for saving/storage, so waiting for an on-chain transfer is never going to be a concern. The only other scenario for wanting to move money back to a wallet if to then make an on-chain payment with the funds...which is an odd edge case, as it would almost always make more sense to make the payment via LN.
1) You don't have to open a channel with everyone in town. Just a few channels might be sufficient. This is the "network" part of the "lightning network", if you want to pay someone, but don't have a direct channel with them, you can send the payment through one of your existing channels, which will forward the payment hopping through other people's channels until it reaches its destination. (ex: You have a channel with Alice, you want to pay Bob, but you do not have a channel with Bob. However Alice &amp; Bob are connected, so you send the payment to Alice, and ask her to forward it to Bob on your behalf). Best of all, this happens in a trustless and non-custodial manner, i.e. intermediate nodes cannot steal the in-transit payment (thanks to a cryptographic contract called the "Hashed Time-Lock Contract").
Also, you do not need to fill a channel with everything you expect to spend, because you can refill the channel through the network. Example: You open a $20 channel with Starbucks, you spend everything. Then let's say someone pays you through Lightning for some small service, their payment can arrive through your Starbucks channel which will now be refilled. Sweet, more coffee! (or something else, you don't necessarily have to use that channel only to pay Starbucks)
2) No need to close a channel to spend coins in it. If Starbucks wants to spend the coins they received from your channel, they can pay someone else using you as a router. (ex: they refill your channel, and in exchange you use some other channel of yours to route their payment to someone of their choice). The only reason to close a channel is if the other party become unresponsive, which hopefully would be infrequent enough to not be a huge problem.
Even in that case, in the future we will have "channel factories" which are a way to open/close payment channels off-chain, which will further optimize and reduce the costs of the whole process, dramatically reducing the need to pay miner fees.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.

Sure thing.
* the idea that you can only use an LN channel to transact with a small number of 'certain people' is incorrect. You can transact with anyone else connected to the network.
* the idea that on-chain fees (i.e. to open/close LN channels) will remain at the current ridiculous levels is an unreasonable assumption that ignores all the scaling currently in progress to combat that very problem
* the idea that channels would be regularly opened/closed is incorrect - most people would keep their channel(s) open indefinitely
There is no 'locking up'. This is FUD spread by those who don't like LN as a scaling solution.
If you take money out of your bank account and put it in your wallet, would you consider that 'locking it up'? No, you're actually making your money more usable.
With BTC in a wallet, you can make payments via the blockchain (slow, requires non-neglible fees, requires confirmations, not very private). With BTC in LN, you can make cheap, instant, more private payments to anyone on the LN network (which, at least theoretically, will be anyone with bitcoin).
If for some reason you need your BTC back in a standard wallet, you just transfer it back with a regular bitcoin transaction. You'd only really need to send money back to a regular wallet for saving/storage, so waiting for an on-chain transfer is never going to be a concern. The only other scenario for wanting to move money back to a wallet if to then make an on-chain payment with the funds...which is an odd edge case, as it would almost always make more sense to make the payment via LN.
1) You don't have to open a channel with everyone in town. Just a few channels might be sufficient. This is the "network" part of the "lightning network", if you want to pay someone, but don't have a direct channel with them, you can send the payment through one of your existing channels, which will forward the payment hopping through other people's channels until it reaches its destination. (ex: You have a channel with Alice, you want to pay Bob, but you do not have a channel with Bob. However Alice &amp; Bob are connected, so you send the payment to Alice, and ask her to forward it to Bob on your behalf). Best of all, this happens in a trustless and non-custodial manner, i.e. intermediate nodes cannot steal the in-transit payment (thanks to a cryptographic contract called the "Hashed Time-Lock Contract").
Also, you do not need to fill a channel with everything you expect to spend, because you can refill the channel through the network. Example: You open a $20 channel with Starbucks, you spend everything. Then let's say someone pays you through Lightning for some small service, their payment can arrive through your Starbucks channel which will now be refilled. Sweet, more coffee! (or something else, you don't necessarily have to use that channel only to pay Starbucks)
2) No need to close a channel to spend coins in it. If Starbucks wants to spend the coins they received from your channel, they can pay someone else using you as a router. (ex: they refill your channel, and in exchange you use some other channel of yours to route their payment to someone of their choice). The only reason to close a channel is if the other party become unresponsive, which hopefully would be infrequent enough to not be a huge problem.
Even in that case, in the future we will have "channel factories" which are a way to open/close payment channels off-chain, which will further optimize and reduce the costs of the whole process, dramatically reducing the need to pay miner fees.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

Think of Canada and their current surplus of energy right now. They have so much they can't 'get rid of it' so it's wasted. The issue is transferring energy is a huge waste because there's so much lost in the process.
Bitcoin is a way to 'store extra energy' around the globe via mining profits and contribution.

It's a centralized scam.
This is why Bitcoin maximalists consider altcoins to be essentially worthless. Their properties aren't real. Anything about them can be changed, if they are centralized. Anything about $XRP can be changed at the whims of Ripple the company. Anything about $IOTA can be changed by IOTA Foundation. None of their properties, whatever they may be, are real. They are not rigid, because they do not rest on a decentralized foundation nor are they tried and tested and at the scale of btc. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts who do not value decentralization above all are a misled bunch. None of the properties they value about a certain coin matter, if they do not first cement them in decentralization.
Reminder: You can build something anywhere on the spectrum of decentralized-centralized on a foundation that is decentralized. You can only build centralized on top of a foundation that is centralized.

Because BTC is opensource it's accessible for everyone to 'watch' exactly what's going on, this not typical for how software is created unless you work in the industry.
I work in the tech industry and we have daily scrums/meetings and work in an agile way—the client only participates and watch if they want. The software you use daily was created in a similar fashion but you only see the end product.

Bitcoin is not a fucking company. Your explanation is flawed from the beginning. Companies are centralized entities. One of the main reasons that make this protocol special is that it's decentralized by how it works. The same can't be said for other altcoins.

In reality, Vitalik an Co controls the state of Ethereum. While it is decentralized in terms of how it is reach consensus on transactions all the code decisions are made by a few people at ethereum foundation. While the foundation is not running its network it determines every minute of the code. Ethereum set up it alliance and offshoots in a number of countries including Russia. An eth network is permissionless as expected and its blockchain is ok. But it is more centralized in a sense of administration. no thank you.
Here are four major reasons it will fail:
CRYPTOCURRENCY ICOS ARE A RISK Even though virtually every company or project looking to raise money wishes to conduct an Ethereum-based ICO, these crowdsales can have negative repercussions. A lot of these projects will eventually liquidate the amount of ETH raised and dump it all on the market. Not only will this affect the Ether price negatively, but it also shows Ethereum is merely a facilitator to raise funds, rather than technology in which these companies believe.
It is only a matter of time until the influx of cryptocurrency ICOs backfires on the Ethereum ecosystem. There is no guarantee that any of these projects have legitimate intentions, and any bad PR will automatically taint Ethereum’s reputation further. While it is true that Ether allows people from all over the world to invest in ICOs, there is never a guarantee for success.
EXPLOITS AND WEAKNESSES Even though many companies have joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, they are not necessarily aware of the issues this network has. We have seen two major exploits discovered and used, both of which resulted in massive amounts of funds being stolen. The first exploit was the DAO smart contract bug, and the second exploit showed how Ethereum has no secure multisignature wallet solution currently. Immature technology often suffers from issues like these.
NO SUPPLY CAP Contrary to what some people may assume, there is no official hard cap on the amount of ETH. While proof-of-work will be replaced by proof-of-stake in the future, Ethereum will continue to be inflationary as a result. Unlike Bitcoin, with its 21 million hard cap, Ethereum has no fixed maximum supply. This means the value of every individual ETH lowers every time a new coin is brought into circulation. In this regard, Ethereum is quite similar to fiat currencies, even though its level of inflation is significantly lower.
NOT AN IMMUTABLE BLOCKCHAIN The main selling point of Ethereum is how it provides blockchain technology and new features to the entire world. One of the primary aspects of using a blockchain is that this ledger creates an undisputed record of events which can no longer be altered once the information has been accepted and confirmed by the rest of the network. That is no longer the case for Ethereum, and it is surprising how few people recognize this important detail.
Ethereum’s developers introduced a hard fork after the DAO was hacked. This hack put a large amount of the available ETH supply at risk of falling into the wrong hands. The hard fork also removed the immutability aspect of the Ethereum blockchain. This means that any application or project built on top of the Ethereum blockchain could see part of its history or transactions wiped out if a similar incident were to occur. People looking for the immutable Ethereum blockchain should look into Ethereum Classic, which was maintained as an ideological opposition to this blockchain rollback.

Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

What trends are you referring to? People won't leave because Bitcoin _IS_ the superior tech. 
This is why Bitcoin maximalists consider altcoins to be essentially worthless. Their properties aren't real. Anything about them can be changed, if they are centralized. Anything about $XRP can be changed at the whims of Ripple the company. Anything about $IOTA can be changed by IOTA Foundation. None of their properties, whatever they may be, are real. They are not rigid, because they do not rest on a decentralized foundation. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts who do not value decentralization above all are a misled bunch. None of the properties they value about a certain coin matter, if they do not first cement them in decentralization.
Reminder: You can build something anywhere on the spectrum of decentralized-centralized on a foundation that is decentralized. You can only build centralized on top of a foundation that is centralized.

If so, in the current protocol, nodes do not know how many more hops there are until they reach the destination.  If someone wants more privacy to be resistant against a Sybil attack, they can just use a longer path and pay slightly higher fees.

 The government needs to control the money supply to some extent to 'control' their populace. Aka we'll have bigger issues on our hands if it could scale to that level.

You do realize thats why BTC was created was because the MONEY SUPPLY was being manipulated right? If you can't validate the money supply(node), then Bcash or a protocol with large blocks can be perverted and used against the poor and downtrodden IDENTICALLY to the way fiat is.

Bitcoin has been around since 2008. A lot of us have been around for a long time and now have to deal with people like you who want to 'get rich'. People like you who rather not put in the effort and hard work to understand but instead rely on conspiracy stories and misinformation because it's easier for them to understand.

This is a foolish FUD statement. 
*EVERY OTHER COMPETITOR WILL HAVE THE SAME FUCKING PROBLEM.*
Bitcoin is ahead of any 'competitor' out there right now as far as solutions.
You're only noticing it with Bitcoin because it's the first to reach this level of popularity. All your doing is spreading emotion drivel around.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years any crypto at this popularity will scale onchain. Bitcoin still works without this second layer but it's a step in progress. Stop talking shit and educate yourself. Otherwise, you're part of the problem:
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:47


No, it's time to insist on LARGE platforms, like COINBASE, to implement Segwit. Even if lighting is 'done' there's no gurantee that businesses would implement it.

[-canonicalensemble posting on btc](
Have you ever taking the time to understand why your shitcoin wont work?
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

It's not that difficult for them to switch to P2SH-P2WPKH addresses if they are using bitcoind on the backend. It's literally just adding 1 extra RPC call to addwitnessaddress after generating a new address. If they are going to make the leap directly to native segwit / bech32 addresses, which would be great, it is a little more complicated. But seriously... Stop giving them excuses. Look at the revenue coinbase has. Look at the revenue that Electrum has. Electrum has been using bech32 for over a month with zero revenue.

It's  embarrassing to see 'leading news organizations' spread disinformation so rapidly and give advice without any repercussion. This interview makes me question what they say even more so because of how incorrect and misguided they are.

comment from the other thread:
"I watched 4 seconds of the video and i knew what that retard was trying to say, and he is wrong!
let me explain it to you;
You don't own any coins! there are no coins! What exists, is a mathematical puzzle that you have to solve using your private key (your wallet does that) in order for you to unlock them and send them to another person (key)
These unsolved mathematical puzzles are in a data set called the UTXO "unspent transaction outputs". the people who can solve these unlocked puzzles are the "owners of bitcoin"
good so far?
with lightning it's still the same thing, except the puzzle change. now it includes a multisig between you and the lightning node, with a time lock that releases the funds back to YOU if your partner (lightning node) doesn't play ball! so, it doesn't matter if your coins are locked up in a UTXO, or a multisig, at the end of the day, you have control over them. Don't fall for their bullshit! BCASH is fucking retarded. to have thousands of transactions per seconds you need gig blocks. at that point you're back to paypal and visa and we really didn't change anything. Maybe that's their plan all along. how is that for a conspiracy.

For the naysayer bears worried about 'Wallstreet': derivatives are not a bad thing. If they are built on a sound currency that CANNOT be inflated (like Bitcoin...), they should be able to provide stability and create more predictable market behavior.

No you're wrong.
It's really simple, people who can't do math and realize on chain fees can be amortized will create a centralized ponzi scheme that can be censored, shut down, and have payments blocked/frozen/money seized because they have no grasp of reality.
idk how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb.. I’d love to see the Bcash network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for bcash. You've been hoodwinked to sign up to a centralized coin that can be changed whenever necessary.
I'll stick with my censorship resistant coin and you can follow the corporation coin, good riddance.
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
bcash is null and void because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly. Increasing block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there's only companies running the nodes then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions. I truly feel sorry for those who dont understand this due to their myopathy.

The impact that inflation has on the time value of money is that inflation decreases the value of a dollarover time.

@_date: 2017-12-24 05:33:43
No, it's actually working exactly as planned.
Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap.

Exactly my point. We're not there yet, it still works but the second layer will be what everyday folk will interact with. This UX is still being built—people won't have to deal with the technical side once the UX successfully handles users. A marriage between design and functionality, this part of the process takes time.
It's really simple, people who can't do the math and realize on chain fees can be amortized will create a centralized ponzi scheme that can be censored, shut down, and have payments blocked/frozen/money seized because they have no grasp of reality. Anytime a node is 'in a data center' you're handing over the FUCKING CREDIBILITY.
You do realize thats why BTC was created was because the MONEY SUPPLY was being manipulated right? If you can't validate the money supply(node), then BCH or a protocol with large blocks can be perverted and used against the poor and downtrodden IDENTICALLY to the way fiat is.
I don't know how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb.. I’d love to see the BCH network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for BCH. You've been hoodwinked to sign up to a centralized coin that can be changed whenever necessary.
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
This is a poor design decision because it WILL get FILLED almost instantly. Increasing the block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there are only companies running the nodes then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
This is why the value transfer layer needs to be complemented by payment network layers built on top of it, like the Lightning Network. A payment network connected to the value network can handle millions of transactions essentially for free. This is because transactions on the payment network don't actually have to be included in blocks and therefore users aren't competing over a scarce resource. Payment networks are as fast and seamless as using virtual money in a video game, but they are backed by the blockchain which, unlike the video game, gives them veracity. A payment network without the blockchain would just be monopoly money, but with a blockchain the transactions become real much like credit card transactions are real because they are ultimately backed by, and settled in, paper money (or central bank reserves).
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland?

Okay, I just wanted to take the time to say I'm sorry for being an asshole to you. It upsets me that your pushover attitude is leaking all over. You're giving them the benefit of doubt for no reason when Brian is on record saying users don't care about SegWit but would rather have shitcoins added. The internet is amazing at galvanizing people and 'getting things done', but you prefer to 'settle for mediocracy'. There's no waiting by the sideline this is our prerogative to apply pressure to Coinbase.
Sticking up for a company[ who's on the record saying their users aren't interested in SegWit]( is disingenuous and a complete slap in the face to all their users who have been loyal customers and driving others to sign up. These are the 'first adopters' who spread the word. We're the ones who realize the implications of a major platform not implementing an upgrade that in return degrades overall performance and usability. I get the sense that the companies behind s2x are 'butthurt' because users won, they are dragging their feet because it offers no 'direct benefit' to them. They'll need to have their hands forced by inundating them with messages since they aren't convinced users want this upgrade—he said in the interview he doesn't 'hear the want for SegWit' from the users. 
Regardless of your stance, you should consider emailing/calling/tweeting them because at the end of the day this implementation would be a net positive for everyone using btc. It behooves us to take action.

The CME Group, arguably the world's most liquid futures exchange, will begin listing bitcoin futures within days. Futures contracts are financial derivatives, an asset whose price is determined by an underlying asset. CME's bitcoin futures will settle in USD, thus, traditional financial institutions will be able to effectively trade bitcoin - i.e. speculate on the price movements of bitcoin.
You will note: the futures contracts settle in USD. How does this affect the price of bitcoin? The answer lies in the arbitrageurs who will straddle both the futures market and the market for the underlying bitcoin.
This is getting technical so before proceeding, I want to provide an analogy. ExxonMobil operates in both the market for physical oil and the futures market for oil. ExxonMobil is in the business of drilling for oil, and not speculating on the price of oil; thus, ExxonMobil sells (short) oil futures contracts to mitigate the price volatility of the oil they own (and are long) before they can physically sell it.
I hope this idea of hedging is clear. **Now, here is why the CME bitcoin futures contracts are bullish for the price of bitcoin in the coming weeks to months.** The bitcoin futures arbitrageurs will hedge in a manner similar to ExxonMobil. Arbitrageurs are not in the business of speculating on the price of bitcoin, they are in the business of lending money to people who buy futures contracts.
Buyers of futures contracts are using margin (i.e. borrowing money). The interest rate at which arbitrageurs lend is determined by the market (but my guess it will be slightly greater than LIBOR).
What happens in financial markets when you can earn interest rates higher than LIBOR effectively risk-free? Large financial players make trades worth billions of dollars.
Here is the punch-line (or the **TL;DR**), arbitrageurs will sell short bitcoin futures contracts and buy the underlying bitcoin. This buying of underlying bitcoin will be bullish for the price of bitcoin - billions of dollars of new money will seek to buy bitcoin.
*Also* derivatives are not a bad thing. If they are built on a sound currency that CANNOT be inflated (like Bitcoin...), they should be able to provide stability and create more predictable market behavior.

Yes, I'm okay with paying high fees because it's how it was designed to work. Plus there are *solutions* on the way. We need to keep the first layer secure for how it works now. Otherwise, anything we build ontop of it will go to *hell in a handbasket.* I realize this might be hard for you realize since we're so often used to completely refind products but this technology is in its infancy and STILL being worked on actively.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. **It's not**. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the *speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times*, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
I'm using Bitcoin because it's a **censorship-resistant** technology first and foremost, once you sacrifice that for 'lower fees' there's the negligible difference compared to any of the legacy payment systems that can be manipulated.

Most of its uses and potential uses fall outside of convention:
* a store of value for those who fear debasement of fiat currency
* a medium of exchange for those denied use of credit cards, debit cards, and checking accounts
* divisible to much smaller units than fiat currency, enabling micropayment schemes in principle
* programmable money that empowers people who don't know each other to create digitally-enforced contracts
* transportable to any other person anywhere else in the world, regardless of whether a state condones it, 24/7
There are others. The point is that most people don't have these needs and so won't see Bitcoin's value. A lot of the 
speculation has to do with the idea that over time these and other uses will start to be perceived as increasingly valuable by a larger segment of the world population.

idk how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb.. I’d love to see the Bcash network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for bcash. You've been hoodwinked to sign up to a centralized coin that can be changed whenever necessary.
I'll stick with my censorship resistant coin and you can follow the corporation coin, good riddance.
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
bcash is null and void because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly. Increasing block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there's only companies running the nodse then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well).  There is no way in a million years it'll scale on chain.  Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions. I truly feel sorry for theiry myopathy.

You do realize that why Bitcoin was created was because _the MONEY SUPPLY_ was being manipulated right? If you can't validate the money supply(muh gigablocks), then Bcash can be perverted and used against the poor and downtrodden IDENTICALLY to the way fiat is.

In reality, Vitalik an Co controls the state of Ethereum. While it is decentralized in terms of how it is reach consensus on transactions all the code decisions are made by a few people at ethereum foundation. While the foundation is not running its network it determines every minute of the code. Ethereum set up it alliance and offshoots in a number of countries including Russia. An eth network is permissionless as expected and its blockchain is ok. But it is more centralized in a sense of administration. no thank you.
Here are four major reasons it will fail: 
CRYPTOCURRENCY ICOS ARE A RISK
Even though virtually every company or project looking to raise money wishes to conduct an Ethereum-based ICO, these crowdsales can have negative repercussions. A lot of these projects will eventually liquidate the amount of ETH raised and dump it all on the market. Not only will this affect the Ether price negatively, but it also shows Ethereum is merely a facilitator to raise funds, rather than technology in which these companies believe.
It is only a matter of time until the influx of cryptocurrency ICOs backfires on the Ethereum ecosystem. There is no guarantee that any of these projects have legitimate intentions, and any bad PR will automatically taint Ethereum’s reputation further. While it is true that Ether allows people from all over the world to invest in ICOs, there is never a guarantee for success.
 EXPLOITS AND WEAKNESSES
Even though many companies have joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, they are not necessarily aware of the issues this network has. We have seen two major exploits discovered and used, both of which resulted in massive amounts of funds being stolen. The first exploit was the DAO smart contract bug, and the second exploit showed how Ethereum has no secure multisignature wallet solution currently.  Immature technology often suffers from issues like these.
NO SUPPLY CAP
Contrary to what some people may assume, there is no official hard cap on the amount of ETH. While proof-of-work will be replaced by proof-of-stake in the future, Ethereum will continue to be inflationary as a result. Unlike Bitcoin, with its 21 million hard cap, Ethereum has no fixed maximum supply. This means the value of every individual ETH lowers every time a new coin is brought into circulation. In this regard, Ethereum is quite similar to fiat currencies, even though its level of inflation is significantly lower.
NOT AN IMMUTABLE BLOCKCHAIN
The main selling point of Ethereum is how it provides blockchain technology and new features to the entire world. One of the primary aspects of using a blockchain is that this ledger creates an undisputed record of events which can no longer be altered once the information has been accepted and confirmed by the rest of the network. That is no longer the case for Ethereum, and it is surprising how few people recognize this important detail.
Ethereum’s developers introduced a hard fork after the DAO was hacked. This hack put a large amount of the available ETH supply at risk of falling into the wrong hands. The hard fork also removed the immutability aspect of the Ethereum blockchain. This means that any application or project built on top of the Ethereum blockchain could see part of its history or transactions wiped out if a similar incident were to occur. People looking for the immutable Ethereum blockchain should look into Ethereum Classic, which was maintained as an ideological opposition to this blockchain rollback.

Blocksize increase would remove the capabilities of the knowledgeable users to run(afford) their own nodes thus making it censorship resistant. This is one of the core reasons why Bitcoin is powerful; an immutable store of value that is decentralized and secure while solving the Byzantine generals problem.
Say if we increase the block...
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.

1) we're not going to have the whole world on board at once, 
2) that assumes that each channel opening and closing is a single TX which completely ignores the kind of space savings using coinjoins for that could bring, let alone signature aggregation which will drastically drop the size of those 
3) ignores the potential for channel factories to create an estimated 90% space savings when it comes to opening and closing two party channels regarding blockspace
Also, completely ignores the potential for sidechains to bleed some traffic from the main chain, particularly when it comes to exchanges
Arbitrage is a lot of blockspace at the moment, exchanges moving to sidechains and LN will free up alot of that space
yes, we may need to raise the blocksize in the future but painting it as "inevitable" in the sense we might as well do it now because we have to is completely manipulative
It ignores the fact that doing so will disincentivize instead of incentivizing being more efficient with blockspace right now
Where we can make huge savings through efficiency. Also, exchanges not batching withdrawals is still a thing which drives fees up for everyone as well as lousy fee estimation and spam attacks which game that all as well.

It's also an active market in that you're bidding on your transactions to be part of the next block
When you broadcast a transaction, to get a confirmation you're bidding for blockchain space, a limited good. Since blocks currently supply megabytes of space, miners maximize their profit by selecting transaction in order of fee rate, i.e. the number of satoshis offered to the miners per byte of transaction size. (Unless there is an additional out-of-band payment that skews selection.) The amount of value transferred has no direct influence on the selection, and there is no guarantee for inclusion, the transaction selection is the miner's prerogative.
It is however your prerogative to increase your bid by updating and re-broadcasting your transaction.
Yes, this is a problem to some degree which is why there are protocol upgrades like SegWit ( and also  Schnorr Signatures, Signature Aggregation, Lightning Network) waiting to be activated (or in the making) that will provide a larger throughput. Unfortunately, Coinbase has neglected to update to SegWit but say to be 'actively' working on it.

Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland?

No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
**Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network.** It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
**What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap.** The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

*What is "Market Capitalization" and how is it calculated?*
Market Capitalization is one way to rank the relative size of a cryptocurrency. It's calculated by multiplying the Price by the Circulating Supply. 
Market Cap = Price X Circulating Supply.
*What is the difference between "Circulating Supply", "Total Supply", and "Max Supply"?*
Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.
Total Supply is the total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).
Max Supply is the best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency.
You sound like you're trying to convince yourself of something that isn't true because you missed out—cognitive dissonance.

Depends on how fast and efficient you can do it. It also depends on how you respond and if you have endless amounts of revisions. You haven't lived until you dealt with design by committee.
It should be at least 2.1BTC. I arrived at this number by considering the time it would take to produced a thoughtful piece: around 10 hours at a rate of $50 an hour.

I would love to share why. First off it would require a hardfork—not being able to roll back as you suggest. So that's not happening anytime soon because you need consensus across the board... and for good reason.
I don't know how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb.. I’d love to see the Bcash network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for bcash. You've been hoodwinked to sign up to a centralized coin that can be changed whenever necessary.
I'll stick with my censorship resistant coin and you can follow the corporation coin, good riddance.
When will the increase stop? 
10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
This is a poor design decision because it **WILL get FILLED almost instantly**. Increasing the block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there are only companies running the nodse then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.
**Let me explain why fees are important**
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free.

Bitcoin is decentralized and governed by mathematics—there's no middle men like we saw in the *Big Short*. Its inherent  transparency and code, for the most part, takes out human intervention and fraud. The credit default swap and the people taking advantage of the system while engaging in neglect were the reason the collapse happened. 
While bitcoin might be subjected to human greed, it's ecosystem is a true free market—it's much harder to perform fuckery. 
So, while I agree bitcoin can fail, we would see it happening before our eyes. It wouldn't be hidden.

And guess how that turned out? Bitcoin is designed to be extremely hard to change.
How does having banks onboarding money change this? Just because you have a lot of capital doesn't mean you can dictate the protocol layer, it's literally by design. it's one of the main reason why people who appreciate the technology are in this space. 
I know it's hard to swallow and, you're right, healthy skepticism is important but look at the clarity of this medium article they released, they actually 'get it'
This is a brilliant paper, suggesting strongly that bitcoin and blockchains for digital assets will revolutionize finance:
 “As an example, the U.S. dollar can have its value adjusted for inflation by the Federal Reserve at any time. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an independent network without any centralized control.”
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:42:12


What's the alternative to this; you honestly think that the population, at large, will one-day wakeup and start running a node? This is the same population that can't fix their router and needs to call their children for tech support. Your pie in the sky thinking is far off my friend. I disagree that they aren't using the underlying asset. When you actively trade on an exchange are you not using bitcoin? If I run a node but also have fidelity account that invests bitcoin am I not using it?
These are the beginning stages, have patience instead of being so dogmatic with your techno-utopia rhetoric. 
People, unfortunately, need these intermediaries to start. The majority are looking for the safe regulated roads to dip into the pool, and while that's not the 'correct' way it's a start.  
Those who are technologically sound and knowledgeable are unaffected other than reaping the benefits from the institutional interest assisting with adoption—a rising tide raises all boats.

No, you're wrong. It's not simple in that it's unrequired and unneeded hardfork, there's no going back it's irresponsible and damaging to the network. I can tell you don't understand slow &amp; safe because you think the risk are 'overblown'. If you were an actual developer I think you might understand but as a laymen, it's hard for you to grasp.
While an increase to 2MB is already a dangerous move when the entire community agrees to it (which is everything but true) because with segwit enabled this will lead to blocks around the size of 4MB, with an absolute maximum of 8MB. A recent Cornell study showed that 4MB is the maximum the current network can stand without losing too many nodes (we'll still lose 5% of all the nodes).
The big problem is that this is a hard fork out of political reasons. An increase to 2MB won't solve anything! Blocks will be full again after a few months and we will have the exact same problems again!! So whether it is a hard fork to 2MB or 1.05MB or 1.000001 MB, none of that makes sense. It splits the community and will result in a loss of trust in the system for the general public.
Bitcoin is all about security and decentralization, when the community throws these out of the window to boost somebody's ego or for some short term profits, it becomes clear that a decentralized currency is a utopia that cannot stand the test of time.

@_date: 2017-08-20 22:56:16


Sure it does, it's called saving face—they are holding out until it becomes apparent to all that the code is unsafe to run, they are signaling to show 'good intention'. We all know the code isn't ready.
And let it be known, Voorhees has his agenda — he has companies that would benefit from an increased size while strangling out users who would no longer be able to run nodes, ruining decentraliz of Bitcoin, to signal/vote for future benefits for the protocol. 
Biggest issues with Segwit2x are a lack of replay protection and the missed opportunity to fix some other things while we are hard forking. And of course the timetable that is far too rushed for an update that isn't backwards compatible. 
And even if it would be OK technically, it's being forced to users in an unacceptable way. It is far too controversial to be safe.
This Sybil-resistant survey  gives some idea of how the ones who do know something feel about NYA and forks in general. 75% disagree with NYA. Most users do not oppose block size increase at some point but most seem to oppose it now (at the time of the survey)
The survey and this are information enough for me to be sure that if 2x goes through as it is now, it will be a disaster to bitcoin. Nothing good will happen.
And what good does 2x give us? Not really much of anything that can't be achieved many times more with smarter and more careful scaling. There are so many better ways to scale but for some reason many people are stuck with the block size limit (or block weight limit after SegWit).

We can already buy stuff you don't need a company in the middle to handle transactions. There are 50 different debt cards right now that allow you to make purchases. We don't need to rely on companies to 'accept' bitcoin there are ways around it. There will always be companies signing up to btc as well as dropping off that's the nature of an open market




...Right but guess what, before that, it needs to function. That is why security and the ability to run a node and 'vote' is sacrosanct.




I never said that. I was implying energy isn't free and you're going to be part of a decentralized, world wide ledger you'll pay the fees. Freedom comes at a price. You realize you can adjust these right? If you don't need confirmations immediately, you can send right now with ~150 sats/byte fee, which for a one-input two-output transaction costs about $1.50. At the end of the day, it'll reach whatever people are willing to pay for it. This is an open market.

A small, technically illiterate brainwashed few have split off; some might say good riddance. Since when do companies matter in BTC? If you're referring to exchanges there are 1000 others looking to take a share of the market if others have a hissy fit. You mention companies like they matter, well they don't. 
Let me break this down for you so you can understand:
1MB blocks = 7 transactions per second (roughly) 
10MB blocks = 70 tps 
100MB blocks = 700 tps
1000MB = 7000 tps 
when will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min.So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data. 2MB debate is retarded because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly...It's obvious we need layer 2 solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well).


No compromises aren't good especially when they threatening something that's sacrosanct. Hardforking is an awful idea and puts the entire ecosystem at risk. The role of Core is to take the safest path:
I think you do not have a clear perspective on the stakes and time-frames involved. Bitcoin's security and robustness is paramount and is strictly more important than any mere technical improvement, no matter how nice of one it is.
Part of the challenge and beauty of working on Bitcoin is that no one controls it. No matter how pretty or perfect you believe some improvement is, it may not be adopted. No process could guarantee the adoption of a change without consigning Bitcoin to worthlessness (especially amid an environment with many competitors that deploy random crap with nary a though to the resulting erosion of personal autonomy).
So segwit is great, but it doesn't hold a candle to the importance of Bitcoin itself. Because segwit is good I'm pretty confidence that we'll have it eventually (or be replaced with something even better), but it ultimately doesn't matter -- not compared to keeping Bitcoin secure and resistant to influence.


We aren't keeping users from using the chain—expedited transaction come in the way of transaction fees. Energy isn't free.
I do foresee a future where transactions could potentially cost hundreds of dollars, but the transactions are in millions, so it's not a big deal. This is how Bitcoin will work once the last coin is 'minted'—covering the cost of hardware and energy.
Here's how Hal Finney saw it: 
Think of bitcoin as a metaphorical Rai stone, a store of large value. The bedrock of new money and the first layer to a SECURE infrastructure governed by math. It's a place to store value for those nations with an infrastructure in place and also a 'seed' for those who don't have a developed infrastructure allowing them to start up and get going easily without paying banks large amounts to deal with their infrastructure.
Rai, or stone money (Yapese: raay[2]), are large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed from aragonite and calcite crystals.[3] Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau,[4] but briefly on Guam as well, and transported for use as money to the island of Yap. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership. Because these stones are too large to move, buying an item with one simply involves agreeing that the ownership has changed. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person it is passed on to, and no physical movement of the stone is required.

@_date: 2018-10-16 00:33:11




keyword 'observation'. guess what? your observation is incorrect and eyes have deceived you. You completely contradicted yourself in one sentence—*absolutely* hilarious.
bitcoin will still work the same even if there are on ramps. how the hell don't you understand this? it doesn't change how it works, therefore those who want to remain souvenir, run their protocol via a node still can — you're inferring otherwise because you're being a delusional hippy. Stop trying to spin this in a negative light when in fact it's positive for everyone. Think of the number of people who will take part and the opportunities it opens up for an investment vehicle. 
 
You're assuming what Grandma knows or doesn't. Do you honestly think 'normal' people pull the levers and push the buttons for their 401k? are you that dense that you think people actively trade their retirement and fully understand every nook and cranny? What matters are the returns that it brings in and this is why major institutions are onboard.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:36:20
There's more downside to upside. It's a contentious HARDFORK— there's no roll back, no replay protection, no support from exchanges to deal with the mess. [None of core]( the people actually working on the protocol, agree with it. [The community, at large, doesn't agree with the change]( Wrecking havoc on the network would be done via the  Segwit2x *compromise*. This is, quite simply, a very bad idea.


This is false. Raising the block size limit would destroy node count and centralize nodes even more so:

You believe it's an okay compromise because you're not a developer (nothing wrong with that just takes some extra work to understand all the implications) and... you're a bit of a pushover.
It's not simple in that it's unrequired and unneeded hardfork, there's no going back it's irresponsible and damaging to the network. I can tell you don't understand slow &amp; safe because you think the risk 'seem like a way to move forward'.
While an increase to 2MB is already a dangerous move when the entire community agrees to it (which is everything but true) because with segwit enabled this will lead to blocks around the size of 4MB, with an absolute maximum of 8MB. A recent Cornell study showed that 4MB is the maximum the current network can stand without losing too many nodes (we'll still lose 5% of all the nodes).
The big problem is that this is a hard fork out of political reasons. An increase to 2MB won't solve anything! Blocks will be full again after a few months and we will have the exact same problems again!! So whether it is a hard fork to 2MB or 1.05MB or 1.000001 MB, none of that makes sense. It splits the community and will result in a loss of trust in the system for the general public. Increased upload bandwidth requirements, which leads to the reduction of full-nodes, which decreases the security of bitcoin, which makes bitcoin unsafe.
Bitcoin is all about security and decentralization, when the community throws these out of the window to boost somebody's ego or for some short term profits, it becomes clear that a decentralized currency is a utopia that cannot stand the test of time.

With segwit enabled we have a block around the size of 4MB.
Here are many optimizations that you can do BEFORE increasing the block. SegWit is an example of this: Instead of increasing the block size, you reduce the transaction size. And there are other optimizations coming (Schnorr signatures) that will reduce the size of the transactions even more (-ish, very technical guys will correct me here). Only once these an other optimizations are coming it will make sense to start increasing the block size, which even core developers support in the long run! the block size as well as a number of other upgrades and improvements.

There's no evidence to date that there's another way to secure a public ledger. PoS is a proof of concept, that's it.
Bitcoin doesn't perform poorly considering it's decentralized and secure. There are trades off to be made if you want to sacrifice decentralization and security — something we're not okay with turning over.

Those alt coins you say are cheaper are nowhere near the size of the legacy chain or market cap, argument null and void. Do you realize that other coins would run into the same problem right?
you are naive to think bitcoin is for everyday people. Fees are a part of reality, it's how the system works:

Hashrate can be disruptive, but it can't dictate the rules. If it could, there wouldn't be such a thing as a 51% attack. The worst the hashrate can do is go on strike. If no one recognizes their altcoin, the miners are just lighting money on fire.
If miners are malicious they're really willing to cause all this disruption instead of just behaving and taking profit can fire striking workers via PoW.

Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
This is why Bitcoin maximalists consider altcoins to be essentially worthless. Their properties aren't real. Anything about them can be changed, if they are centralized.Anything about $XRP can be changed at the whims of Ripple the company. Anything about $IOTA can be changed by IOTA Foundation. None of their properties, whatever they may be, are real. They are not rigid, because they do not rest on a decentralized foundation. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts who do not value decentralization above all are a misled bunch. None of the properties they value about a certain coin matter, if they do not first cement them in decentralization.
Reminder: You can build something anywhere on the spectrum of decentralized-centralized on a foundation that is decentralized. You can only build centralized on top of a foundation that is centralized.
Give me one altcoin that is better than Bitcoin on just one of these 3 ( Decentralization,Security and Speed of Transactions) but still doesn't compromise on the other 2. Bitcoin is the most balanced—that's what matters.

I'm fine with having the choice of paying fees (aka 'biding' for time and energy) it's a market and incentives hashing power as well as cut down on spam. If fees will go as high as $1000, then the price of bitcoin would be much higher as well. So I don't have an issue with this as long as I have the choice. Keeping the protocol censorship resistant and decentralized is what makes this tech imperative to me and different from every other option out there. Once you finally 'get it' you'll understand too, but doesn't seem like you've put enough effort into learning. 


You're incorrect, I actually do but I realize that in order to help these people we'll need second layer solutions. 
When will the increase stop to keep the price low? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps and even more for the rest of the world) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
Just simply increasing the blocksize will get filled almost instantly. Increasing block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there's only companies running the nodes then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit so those people who need low fees will fall victim to others.
Since I provided you with some actual facts I'd love to see your explanation... or can you not think that far ahead? I truly feel sorry for your myopathy. Sorry about your poor investment decision regarding bcash—seems like a bit of a dumpster fire.

This is faulty logic, what gives bitcoin its value is that it's both opensource, anyone can look at the code for how it works and contribute. It's censorship resistant, decentralized and immutable store of value. Even if the NSA/CIA made bitcoin they opened up pandora's box there's no one entity able to control it. If a bank created a coin it wouldn't be decentralized....

Brian from Coinbase has claimed multiple times that he thinks that Ethereum is superior to Bitcoin.
Also, have you ever considered that it's an attack by naive entities contributing to it unbeknownst to them? Think of how companies work under capitalism—our economic system and ideology provides the rules or atmosphere for corporate entities to grow, evolve and die. Humans working for these monolithic beasts serving as white blood cells for the corporation trying to evolve it by any means necessary, in doing so, they are looking out for their bottom line/profit because it's in their best interest but not the bitcoin protocol. To them, bitcoin is difficult to control because of its censorship resistant decentralized nature. This is a direct problem for companies trying to profit so of course, they're trying to take control so they can benefit on behalf of their interest.

So are you refuting that Bitcoin is 'different'?
A technology that has opportunity to reinvent how much of the world works? This isn’t just about finance.
Bitcoin demonstrates a protocol which allows a distributed network to reach consensus even if some of its participants cannot be trusted.  If a majority of participants agree then that agreement is recognized across the network.
This technology, a recognized solution to the The Byzantine Generals Problem is the single new advance embodied in Bitcoin.  It's innovative synthesis of cryptographic technique into a useful overall system deserves applause--a Nobel prize even but none of the other pieces are new. 
The application of Bitcoin's solution of the Byzantine General's Problem is for the determination of whether a proposed collection of new transactions are all based on coins owned by the senders, have not being spent more than once and should be posted to the distributed ledgers that all fully active network participants maintain.  Assured consensus on this action within a distributed network with protection against the risk of dishonest gaming of the system is the result.

@_date: 2017-11-14 18:56:18


This is false. By the nature of how it's setup it's centralized. They can't implement 2nd layer solutions because of the unwillingness to upgrade to segwit —due to eliminating Jihan Wu's financial incentive of asicboost. All their scaling needs to be done on chain. I'm sorry to inform you, but you've been hoodwinked—you're unable to see the forest from the trees. Have you ever played chess before? You need to think moves ahead of your opponent. Well guess what they are setup for centralization and are not censorship resistant; these are literally why we use crypto otherwise you could use paypal or visa who do it more efficiently.
idk how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb.. I’d love to see the Bcash network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for bcash. You've been hoodwinked to sign up to a centralized coin that can be changed whenever necessary.
I'll stick with my censorship resistant coin and you can follow the corporation coin, good riddance.
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min. So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data.
bcash is null and void because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly. Increasing block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there's only companies running the nodse then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). Why are we delaying this simple simple answer with politics? There is no way in a million years can Bitcoin work without 2nd layer solutions. I truly feel sorry for your myopathy.

Let me break this down for you so you can understand:
1MB blocks = 7 transactions per second (roughly)
10MB blocks = 70 tps
100MB blocks = 700 tps
1000MB = 7000tps
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min.So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data. 
2MB debate is null and void because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly. Increasing block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there's only companies running the nodse then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). Why are we delaying this simple simple answer with politics? There is no way in a million years can Bitcoin work without 2nd layer solutions.
Raising the block size limit would destroy node count and centralize nodes even more so: Cornell Study Recommends 4MB Blocksize for Bitcoin: 
It might seem okay for short term but they are setting themselves up for failure and censorship dictated by centralized nodes and how Wu and crew think they should continue

Toliro, I have one word for you: **Antifragility**.
Antifragility refers to systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures. In other words if bitcoin can't stand the heat then it's not worth supporting. Maybe a more robust version or at a different time. But we need these stress tests and anything we can throw at it in order make sure it's capable. Just like an immune system, it needs to be put under different states of duress in order for it to survive, long term, in the "wild".  
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:27:28
Bitcoin Cash is a centralized coin.  For Bitcoin to work, and for any crypto for that matter, it needs to be censorship resistant. Decentralization is how you contribute to this important effort. If it becomes centralized then 'bad' actors can control the protocol's upgraded/downgraded. This is done via flagging your flavor/vote via nodes. 
Bitcoin cash is on its way to becoming centralized. Because of bcash's large blocksize, nodes will only be controlled by those that have large amounts of money because of the price of hardware it will take to run a node—bigger block size means data center nodes. Not to mention, they need to hardfork in order to fix their EDA (Estimated Difficulty Algorithm) It's paypal 2.0. If you research enough you'll see pass their marketing efforts. Plus have you seen how bad their memes are? They're god awful.
Bitcoin is scaling slow and responsible because the people involved realize how important code review and development is. It's still in the beginning stages. It's only 'slow moving' because  there arn't many other projects where you actively can watch developers work 'live'. There's a lot of great features and updates coming. Right now we need support from companies like Coinbase to take advantage of segwit so their fees can be lowered and there's less congestion. Layer 2 solution are also coming:

That statement is null and void—literally canceling itself out— The 'original incentive structure'  is a check and balanced system between multiple entities. That is including users running nodes and flagging for what they see as important, with what you're proposing/vouching for wouldn't be **POSSIBLE**!! By trusting others before "it" you're setting it up for failure.

idk how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb—viabtc just mind a fullblock. I’d love to see the Bcash network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for bcash.

“While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale,” Alex Simons, director of program management at Microsoft Identity Division, wrote in a blog post. “To overcome these technical barriers, we are collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale, while preserving the attributes of a world class DID system.”
Bitcoin cash has many high profile advocates, such as venture capitalist Roger Ver who was formerly associated with the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus.” On the other hand, the startup Blockstream launched the first experimental Lightning Network mainnet weeks ago. LN already has nearly 2000 nodes, far more than the bitcoin cash network. Microsoft’s subtle comment hardly went unnoticed. Lightning fans took to Twitter to praise layered solutions.

Fulls nodes don't have the minging part. This is factually incorrect.
appreciate the convo as well, thanks
What makes a full node?
Full nodes download every block and transaction and check them against Bitcoin's core consensus rules. Here are examples of consensus rules, though there are many more:


Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.
Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.
Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.
If a transaction or block violates the consensus rules, then it is rejected, even if every other node on the network thinks that it is valid. This is one of the most important characteristics of full nodes: they do what's right no matter what. For full nodes, miners actually have fairly limited power: they can only reorder or remove transactions, and only by expending a lot of computing power. A powerful miner is able to execute some serious attacks, but because full nodes rely on miners only for a few things, miners could not completely change or destroy Bitcoin.

As long as governments have their fiat so they can help steer their economic lifeline, they won't worry about crypto—state currency is meant to be spent to keep the economy churning and not saved. As soon as Bitcoin starts to try to take on that role (think bcash/paying with your coffee with Bitcoin), Governments will declare war. Bitcoin's deflationary nature promotes saving; this isn't good for Governments—understandably so. If we were to displace it with Crypto, it would be dangerous. I foresee Bitcoin as a store of wealth for those who are technologically adept and the financial industry, for example, hedge funds and ETFs.
I think Bitcoin will exist and live happily with the state 'elected' currency like the Dollar, Yuan, Dinar. This, in my opinion, is the best scenario. Unforturnetly, I don't see the average person taking on the responsibility of understanding and securing their Bitcoin appropriately anytime soon. There needs to be that fail-safe/safety net that the legacy system provides for the average person like our current banking infrastructure.
I do foresee a future where transactions could potentially cost hundreds of dollars, but the transactions are in millions, so it's not a big deal. This is how Bitcoin will work once the last coin is 'minted'—covering the cost of hardware and energy.
Here's how Hal Finney saw it: 
Think of bitcoin as a metaphorical Rai stone, a store of large value. The bedrock of new money and the first layer to a SECURE infrastructure governed by math. It's a place to store value for those nations with an infrastructure in place and also a 'seed' for those who don't have a developed infrastructure allowing them to start up and get going easily without paying banks large amounts to deal with their infrastructure.
Rai, or stone money (Yapese: raay[2]), are large, circular stone disks carved out of limestone formed from aragonite and calcite crystals.[3] Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau,[4] but briefly on Guam as well, and transported for use as money to the island of Yap. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership. Because these stones are too large to move, buying an item with one simply involves agreeing that the ownership has changed. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person it is passed on to, and no physical movement of the stone is required. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:52:35


There will be others to take their spot, how can you fear this? This is how capitalism works. Bitcoin is about cutting out the middleman not trying to introduce more.


So, by your logic, 2x circumvents government controlled exchanges? I'd say it does the opposite. It centralizes nodes so only certain parties cant operate them—entities with the ability to afford the **large** operating cost— which ultimately results in control for how the software is upgraded. It's literally doing what you're afraid of. It's allowing for *government* or *corporate interest* control even MORE so.
Raising the block size limit would destroy node count and centralize nodes even more so: [Cornell Study Recommends 4MB Blocksize for Bitcoin](

Your ignorance is showing:
It's well known that bitcoin is designed as a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. However, what's often lost in translation is the sheer amount of machinery that is needed to maintain this global infrastructure.
For example, in order to validate and relay transactions, bitcoin requires more than a network of miners processing transactions, it must broadcast messages across a network using 'nodes'. This is the first step in the transaction process that results in a block confirmation.
To function to its full potential, the bitcoin network must not only provide an avenue for transactions, but also remain secure. By using a number of randomly selected nodes, the network can reduce the problem of double spending – when a user attempts to spend the same digital token twice.
However, bitcoin doesn't just need nodes, it requires lots of fully functioning nodes – nodes that have the bitcoin core client on a machine instance with the complete block chain. The more nodes there are, the more secure the network is.
This is one of the reasons there is a plan to put bitcoin nodes in space, and that the plan has important implications for bitcoin.
The problem is, the number of nodes on the network is dropping, and core developers believe it may continue to do so.

ETH!!? Bahahahaha. You have no idea the scaling issues eth has, it's using an awful language JavaScript based  Solidity , do you even program bro? Do you even run or are capable of running an ETH node? Didn't think so. It's a centalized shit coin. I can't belive you fell for the "first, second, third" generation crypto meme. 
In reality, Vitalik an Co controls the state of Ethereum. While it is decentralized in terms of how it is reach consensus on transactions all the code decisions are made by a few people at ethereum foundation. While the foundation is not running its network it determines every minute of the code. Ethereum set up it alliance and offshoots in a number of countries including Russia. An eth network is permissionless as expected and its blockchain is ok. But it is more centralized in a sense of administration. no thank you.
Here are four major reasons it will fail:
CRYPTOCURRENCY ICOS ARE A RISK Even though virtually every company or project looking to raise money wishes to conduct an Ethereum-based ICO, these crowdsales can have negative repercussions. A lot of these projects will eventually liquidate the amount of ETH raised and dump it all on the market. Not only will this affect the Ether price negatively, but it also shows Ethereum is merely a facilitator to raise funds, rather than technology in which these companies believe.
It is only a matter of time until the influx of cryptocurrency ICOs backfires on the Ethereum ecosystem. There is no guarantee that any of these projects have legitimate intentions, and any bad PR will automatically taint Ethereum’s reputation further. While it is true that Ether allows people from all over the world to invest in ICOs, there is never a guarantee for success.
EXPLOITS AND WEAKNESSES Even though many companies have joined the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, they are not necessarily aware of the issues this network has. We have seen two major exploits discovered and used, both of which resulted in massive amounts of funds being stolen. The first exploit was the DAO smart contract bug, and the second exploit showed how Ethereum has no secure multisignature wallet solution currently. Immature technology often suffers from issues like these.
NO SUPPLY CAP Contrary to what some people may assume, there is no official hard cap on the amount of ETH. While proof-of-work will be replaced by proof-of-stake in the future, Ethereum will continue to be inflationary as a result. Unlike Bitcoin, with its 21 million hard cap, Ethereum has no fixed maximum supply. This means the value of every individual ETH lowers every time a new coin is brought into circulation. In this regard, Ethereum is quite similar to fiat currencies, even though its level of inflation is significantly lower.
NOT AN IMMUTABLE BLOCKCHAIN The main selling point of Ethereum is how it provides blockchain technology and new features to the entire world. One of the primary aspects of using a blockchain is that this ledger creates an undisputed record of events which can no longer be altered once the information has been accepted and confirmed by the rest of the network. That is no longer the case for Ethereum, and it is surprising how few people recognize this important detail.
Ethereum’s developers introduced a hard fork after the DAO was hacked. This hack put a large amount of the available ETH supply at risk of falling into the wrong hands. The hard fork also removed the immutability aspect of the Ethereum blockchain. This means that any application or project built on top of the Ethereum blockchain could see part of its history or transactions wiped out if a similar incident were to occur. People looking for the immutable Ethereum blockchain should look into Ethereum Classic, which was maintained as an ideological opposition to this blockchain rollback
PoS is vaporware.

Higher block sizes do not help as much as you think. Have you heard of SPY mining? When a new block header is published by another miner, a miner isn't going to sit still and do nothing while its fullnode is receiving and verifying the new block: it's going to go mine an empty block. Increased block sizes translate to longer receive and verify times, translates to increased SPY mining, translates to an increase in throughput that is less than the rated increase, because "it is a freedom granted by the Bitcoin protocol".
Higher block sizes do not help as much as you think. Have you heard of Elastic Demand? When a road's width is increased, it does not reduce traffic congestion. The key metric is not the number of cars you can push on the road, the key metric is the speed of public transportation: travelling from point A to point B on your private car will always approach the time to go from point A to point B on public transportation regardless of road width (because people will switch to private cars if the public transport is too long, congesting the road and slowing down private cars). Go look up traffic planning: it's been consistent that road width does not help with traffic congestion, while being ridiculously costly. The analog y is: road width = block size, traffic congestion = full mempools, public transportation = LN, private car = on-chain transaction.
Higher block sizes hurt more than you think. Have you heard of quadratic sigop hashing bug? It's a bug from the original core client by Satoshi where, for each sigop, you need to replace each scriptSig with the scriptPubKey it pays to, for each other sigop in the transaction. It can't be fixed unless you move the scriptSig out of the transaction: you know, move the witness data from the main part of the transaction... you know: SEGregate the WITness. SegWit transactions are immune to the quadratic sigop hashing bug. But legacy transactions need to be supported still, otherwise your legacy cash will become unspendable. Why is it called the quadratic hashing bug? Because increasing the size 2x will increase the verification time 4x, increasing the size 4x will increase the verification time 16x, increasing the size 8x will increase the verification time 64x. Okay, so you limit legacy transactions to 1Mb, which is still doable. This is what Bcash, SegWit, and 2X all do, but SegWit will only allow a single 1Mb legacy transaction per block (and the block gets capped to 1Mb due to the weight computation) while Bcash will allow 8 and 2X will allow 2 of those, which is still relatively heavy and increase the risk that SPY mining of empty blocks becomes necessary.
Higher block sizes hurt more than you think. Have you heard of the FIBRE network? It's a network specifically designed for transmitting blocks between miners. It reduces the window that miners do SPY mining, by improving the speed at which blocks are transferred to SPY-mining pools. Without FIBRE, the "normal" peer-to-peer Bitcoin protocol would have choked on 1Mb blocks. Current measurements with FIBRE indicate that 2Mb blocks are safe, with the occassional 4Mb (possible with the 4M weight limit in SegWit) still acceptable. 2X does not mean 2Mb blocks, 2X means 4Mb blocks regularly with good SegWit usage. FIBRE is likely to choke on that transmission rate, increasing temporary chainsplits (which requires increasing the number of confirmations you wait for before crediting a transaction, utterly reversing the "fast" requirement you wanted with biggerblocks) and further increasing the rate of empty blocks due to SPY mining.
Hardforks are bad, as by default, without a massive consensus, they "fail bad": they create a new altcoin. Softforks are better as by default they "fail good": nothing happens and everyone goes on with legacy rules on a single chain. Indeed, we've figured out how to do block size increases by softfork already, xref. SegWit. Block size increase hardforks are dangerous and the improvement does not justify the danger you put the entire network through.

What evidence are you looking for exactly? Are you expecting DCG to come out and say this?
How about the fact that the majority of the *ACTIVE* and *INFORMED* part of the community don't agree with it?
Further technical complaints which are axillary to the fundamental problems mentioned above wrt general corruption include :
Incompetent developers
Failure to implement replay protection
Failure to accept community review of the codebase leading to numerous low quality implementation details such as non use of the hard fork bit in favor of a disgusting hack to force hard fork via mandatory invalid block creation etc.
There has been no routine maintenance on the S2x codebase in over a month, while bitcoin proper had made a high number of non consensus improvements that competent fork developers would have merged, etc.


This is not true and not what we want. If it comes to this then those running the nodes will dictate how bitcoin is upgrade, including the ability to increase the 21 million amount:
[Bitcoin Q&amp;A: What is the role of nodes?](
Many people don't educate themself before posting nonsense here (which you obviously can see in your answers) and also don't understand how economics work:
Blocks will be full anyway - independent if the max size is 1,2 or 8 MB - because the more free space a block has - the lower the transaction fee will be. Lower transaction fees (or even 0!) =&gt; more transactions will be made =&gt; until the blocks are full again and tx fees rise again.
So yeah, better inform yourself before trusting anyone here with wrong or missleading answers.
if it's going to 4MB then what is the rush?
There is no rush. There is just a political campaign to overtake power from miners (to block further scaling solutions like segwit/lightning/mast/schnorr which will come in the next weeks/months and keep the fees high for the miners..).. Nothing more.
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, your client also validates. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core). If all of the sudden all miners started validating according to some new rules, your client is coded to simply ignore them, and as soon as just 1 miner following the rules your client accepts as valid shows up, the network can continue to operate under these same rules. The ONLY way for rules to ever change for you is if YOU PERSONALLY download a new client version with new rules. I cannot stress enough how important this is. This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else. Now this doesn't mean you should never accept new rules in a new client. In fact you already did because those new rules solved a technical problem. 
But if you want to keep the Bitcoin money system running under the principles that it is built upon today (FINITENESS, TANGIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ANONYMITY, SECURITY, DECENTRALIZATION, SELF-OWNERSHIP, INTEGRITY, PRACTICALITY, RATIONALISM) it is paramount that any such rule changes do not immediately or down the road preclude you from being able to run a full node. Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a sovereign in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change.
 But if running a full node becomes impossible for you then all that which you were told about Bitcoin, that rules virtually can't change, that it has a strict limit of 21million, ect, all these rules will then be left to be decided by a small number of super nodes and the people who control them. The second this becomes reality Bitcoin will be no different than simply a slightly more transparent Paypal. And if you don't want that you better make damn sure you can run a full node.

I highly doubt that. You might not be aware of you own bias aka 'an unknown, unknown'. For example you said 'plauged' with NO2X rhetoric, you're implying this movement is negative.
First lets look at technical reason, let's not talk about the obvious lack of replay protection which we know about and, when standing alone, is enough to not support the hardfork.
Higher block sizes do not help as much as you think. Have you heard of SPY mining? When a new block header is published by another miner, a miner isn't going to sit still and do nothing while its fullnode is receiving and verifying the new block: it's going to go mine an empty block.

An individual user cannot change the protocol. 12 angry men meeting in a club on Jekyll Island a hotel in New York cannot change the protocol. The Digital Currency Group with a super majority of miners cannot change the protocol. Developers cannot change the protocol. A democratic majority of nodes, miners, and exchanges cannot change the protocol. Consensus, and only consensus can change the protocol.
There is some risk involved in determining consensus but sometimes it is incredibly obvious such as the attack known as S2X. If something is backward compatible the risk is reduced.
What you are describing is the voluntary nature of using bitcoin. Obviously you are not required to use bitcoin. Obviously you can do all sorts of things to open source software. Obviously you can use your internet connection as you please. Obviously you can use your money, time, and property to try and compete or attack bitcoin. What you cannot do is contentiously change bitcoin. Bitcoin would be a lot less interesting if you could.
So Why Can't the Bitcoin Rules Change? The answer may surprise you!!1 (reading time ~5min)
Well the title is a lie. Of course they can change and they already have changed in the past. But if this is bad news to you and you were lead to believe something else, don't fret, it's not all bad. Here, let me try and give you the bigger picture about rules in Bitcoin and who it is that you need to trust, that they won't change to something you won't like.
First, there's a myth that I want to address. I also want to make sure the community pays attention to this issue. Because as Ben Franklin told a woman, the Americans got a republic if they can keep it (turns out they couldn't), so too I'm here to tell you that you have an excellent money system on your hands, if you can keep it.
Myth: Miners set the rules by voting
False. Miners do not vote, they validate. They check that transactions meet the rules and then they pass the block to their immediate peer nodes who validates it, and if it is valid, adds it to their copy of the blockchain and passes it on to their peer nodes. If a subset of miners decide that a certain rule should be changed, what happens ISN'T that all miners now validate transactions according to the new rule even if the subset has the majority of hashing power, instead a so called hard fork happens and some miners validate transactions that obey the new rules, and those who stick with the old rules ignore them and by virtue of ignoring each other they split into two peer to peer networks.
But what if all miners suddenly switch to new rules? Can they do this? Is there something that stops them? Answer: YES, EVERY NON MINING FULL NODE
I mean this is critical for every Bitcoin user to understand. Bitcoin is a decentralized system, in which if you run a full node YOU HAVE A SAY in what rules are to be followed. Because once the miner adds a new block, they send it around across the network, and when it gets to you, your client also validates. It validates that the miner validated the transactions and added them into a block and into the blockchain following the right rules, rules that you gave your EXPLICIT consent to when you downloaded the Satoshi client(Bitcoin core).

This so important that it should be paramount for anyone who has any significant wealth in Bitcoin to run your own full node regardless of the costs that brings to you. I myself do it too, even though I don't even use the client for anything else.

Because if you can't run a full node and you trust someone else to do it for you, then you have effectively given away your power to have say about what rules Bitcoin follows.
Right now you are a sovereign in Bitcoin. You should never give that up, under any circumstance.
What do I mean with sovereign? Well there's nothing anyone could possibly do that can make you accept rules you didn't agree with. Nothing. You yourself have to decide to consent to a rule change.

Do you even internet bro, truly ugly link— shows how triggered you are. CFTC and SEC hearing is behind the bitcoin rebound. Not tether. I can't believe you linked to this SJW's article. Click-bait journalism at its finest. 
Lifehacker posts a story yesterday saying Tether is causing Bitcoin’s crash and now Giz says it’s causing Bitcoin’s climb...
Understand what you're talking about before linking to garbage like this. There was 16 billion in volume. That's 1,600 million. Explain how 80m would do anything? Obviously, the SEC hearing was the main driver. One of the dumbest articles I've read in a while. Are you suggesting 80m in tether stabilized the market yesterday?

No you don't understand what tether is!! This whole thing stems from one guy on Twitter misinforming a ton of people in what tether is. How in fuck can you believe tether printing supported the bull market and not mass adoption.. there is only just over 1billion tether out there and the cryptocurrency market cap is approaching 1 trillion.
Just to say it again. Tether is created when people WITHDRAW from finex. The money in finex is a bunch of big whales. If someone wants to move some cash to buy alts they do a tether withdraw to another exchange. Those dollars go into the tether bank account and tether is shipped to another exchange.
All this bullshit about it being printed money was entirely fabricated by a guy on Twitter named bitfinexed. He clearly has an axe to grind about the entire crypto ecosystem and has a conspiracy theory for literally every market action on any exchange. He post hundreds of times a week and obviously has some obsessive schizophrenic disorder.
New people read his posts and like most conspiracy theories sound like they follow a system of logic. EXCEPT he completely miss represents when tethers are created to a bunch of people that don't know better.
The reason there is no correlation in price there is that it's not money being printed to buy coin. It's money that was just created by selling coin then moved around then bought different coins.
Bitfinex makes millions a day in trading fees. Why in fuck would they do the things alleged against them and jeapordize that?
I hate how gullible everyone has been in this subject. It couldn't possibly be that everyone's mom Uncle and dog got into cryptocurrency.. that cnbc started running crytpo programs all day... No... It's the 1 billion in tether that created this entire bill run???
Get fucking real. I get so pissed hearing this because it's so obviously wrong.

Not centralized— plus miners are ever 'influx' they work for us as long as you can run your own node.
Common misunderstanding =&gt; Nodes rules not miners
6:33 "Nodes decide what the rules are, not miners. Miners get the transactions that nodes decided were valid. And they give back blocks, at the pleasure of the nodes, that will decide if they are worthy of being propagated because they are valid. The validity of the consensus rules is not determined by miners. They sequence transactions into a block. The validity of the consensus rules is determined by nodes, because they will not propagate lies."


By the design of the protocol, please refer to above commentary on how and why it works


Failed in what way exactly? It became popular and the system operated exactly as designed. People bid for space—like explained above—then the transactions increased accordingly. The security and censorship resistance is imperative to keep intact—there's no sacrificing these two. 
This is why Bitcoin maximalists consider altcoins to be essentially worthless. Their properties aren't real. Anything about them can be changed, if they are centralized. Anything about $XRP can be changed at the whims of Ripple the company. Anything about $IOTA can be changed by IOTA Foundation. None of their properties, whatever they may be, are real. They are not rigid because they do not rest on a decentralized foundation nor are they tried and tested and at the scale of btc. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts who do not value decentralization above all are a misled bunch. None of the properties they value about a certain coin matter, if they do not first cement them in decentralization.
Reminder: You can build something anywhere on the spectrum of decentralized-centralized on a foundation that is decentralized. You can only build centralized on top of a foundation that is centralized.
Give me one altcoin that is better than Bitcoin on just one of these 3 ( Decentralization, Security, and Speed of Transactions) but still doesn't compromise on the other 2. Bitcoin is the most balanced—that's what matters.
What metric are you using to quantify or qualifying this 'failing'?
according to the volume, it's doing well and transaction outputs.
Bitcoin became very popular very fast and is still working accordingly just because the development hasn't caught up doesn't mean it's failed. The development is working at breakneck speeds:

As long as governments have their fiat so they can help steer their economic lifeline, they won't worry about crypto—state currency is meant to be spent to keep the economy churning and not saved. As soon as Bitcoin starts to try to take on that role (think bcash/paying with your coffee with Bitcoin), Governments will declare war. Bitcoin's deflationary nature promotes saving; this isn't good for Governments—understandably so. If we were to displace it with Crypto, it would be dangerous. I foresee Bitcoin as a store of wealth for those who are technologically adept and the financial industry, for example, hedge funds and ETFs.
I think Bitcoin will exist and live happily with the state 'elected' currency like the Dollar, Yuan, Dinar. This, in my opinion, is the best scenario. Unforturnetly, I don't see the average person taking on the responsibility of understanding and securing their Bitcoin appropriately anytime soon. There needs to be that fail-safe/safety net that the legacy system provides for the average person like our current banking infrastructure.

I'm not sure you realize the importance of nodes.
Higher block sizes do not help as much as you think. Have you heard of SPY mining? When a new block header is published by another miner, a miner isn't going to sit still and do nothing while its fullnode is receiving and verifying the new block: it's going to go mine an empty block. Increased block sizes translate to longer receive and verify times, translates to increased SPY mining, translates to an increase in throughput that is less than the rated increase, because "it is a freedom granted by the Bitcoin protocol".
Higher block sizes do not help as much as you think. Have you heard of Elastic Demand? When a road's width is increased, it does not reduce traffic congestion. The key metric is not the number of cars you can push on the road, the key metric is the speed of public transportation: travelling from point A to point B on your private car will always approach the time to go from point A to point B on public transportation regardless of road width (because people will switch to private cars if the public transport is too long, congesting the road and slowing down private cars). Go look up traffic planning: it's been consistent that road width does not help with traffic congestion, while being ridiculously costly. The analog y is: road width = block size, traffic congestion = full mempools, public transportation = LN, private car = on-chain transaction.
Higher block sizes hurt more than you think. Have you heard of quadratic sigop hashing bug? It's a bug from the original core client by Satoshi where, for each sigop, you need to replace each scriptSig with the scriptPubKey it pays to, for each other sigop in the transaction. It can't be fixed unless you move the scriptSig out of the transaction: you know, move the witness data from the main part of the transaction... you know: SEGregate the WITness. SegWit transactions are immune to the quadratic sigop hashing bug. But legacy transactions need to be supported still, otherwise your legacy cash will become unspendable. Why is it called the quadratic hashing bug? Because increasing the size 2x will increase the verification time 4x, increasing the size 4x will increase the verification time 16x, increasing the size 8x will increase the verification time 64x. Okay, so you limit legacy transactions to 1Mb, which is still doable. This is what Bcash, SegWit, and 2X all do, but SegWit will only allow a single 1Mb legacy transaction per block (and the block gets capped to 1Mb due to the weight computation) while Bcash will allow 8 and 2X will allow 2 of those, which is still relatively heavy and increase the risk that SPY mining of empty blocks becomes necessary.
Higher block sizes hurt more than you think. Have you heard of the FIBRE network? It's a network specifically designed for transmitting blocks between miners. It reduces the window that miners do SPY mining, by improving the speed at which blocks are transferred to SPY-mining pools. Without FIBRE, the "normal" peer-to-peer Bitcoin protocol would have choked on 1Mb blocks. Current measurements with FIBRE indicate that 2Mb blocks are safe, with the occassional 4Mb (possible with the 4M weight limit in SegWit) still acceptable. 2X does not mean 2Mb blocks, 2X means 4Mb blocks regularly with good SegWit usage. FIBRE is likely to choke on that transmission rate, increasing temporary chainsplits (which requires increasing the number of confirmations you wait for before crediting a transaction, utterly reversing the "fast" requirement you wanted with biggerblocks) and further increasing the rate of empty blocks due to SPY mining.
Hardforks are bad, as by default, without a massive consensus, they "fail bad": they create a new altcoin. Softforks are better as by default they "fail good": nothing happens and everyone goes on with legacy rules on a single chain. Indeed, we've figured out how to do block size increases by softfork already, xref. SegWit. Block size increase hardforks are dangerous and the improvement does not justify the danger you put the entire network through.

Roger Ver Lies
Antpool = Viabtc conclusive proof 
The fee lie - Everyone can see that roger ver is lying again when there are literally no txs in the  mempool and 5 sat txs are in the next block
More fee lies from "Bitcoin Judas"
Roger Ver lies more often than he tells the truth. This is not an attack, just an objective observation of the facts.
"Mt. Gox is totally fine." ( ... shortly thereafter Mt. Gox implodes ... "I am here to 'apologize'. Even though everything I said when I told you 'Mt. Gox is fine' was true, I am sorry that some of you lost money when it collapsed. Buy ether."
"I am banned from posting in ... accidentally posts to ... "Oops. Now I'll pretend like I never claimed to be banned from and ignore anyone who asks me about that claim."
"I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC"... 2 weeks later: "I haven't sold a single Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday"
He lies about the subreddit he controls. He regularly lies about his holdings. He lied and scammed his way into the bitcoin.com domain, which he uses to push out FUD about Bitcoin and its developers. He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. "the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead"). He even had the audacity to lie about what happened in court, when there is a public transcript available which disproves everything he said.
There are more examples of blatant deception that I don't have the time or patience to dig up right now. Make no mistake: the man is, unfortunately, a sociopath.

From a commenter that saw yours:
"Interesting, I had the opposite theory (that BCH would use the EDA to lure profit-seeking miners away from BTC into BCH, while miners willing to honor the NYA for at least a few days would languish on the B2X chain; this would leve thr BTC chain with only the ideological pro-core miners, who are very few.
Now that they fix the EDA, it seems like that won't be taking place. I don't see how fixing the EDA might help B2X actually. Plus, the fact that from now on the BCH chain's difficulty is going to change every 144 blocks mean that whatever hashrate BCH attracts will quickly go back to BTC (or B2X but I don't think that"s likely for profit-seeking miners).
So I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this HF on BCH... unless they have some very nefarious and non-obvious thing in store."

@_date: 2017-10-22 05:57:23
Sorry was this sarcasm or are you just daft? We're  working on scaling solution via layer 2. Let me break this down for you so you can understand:
1MB blocks = 7 transactions per second (roughly) 
10MB blocks = 70 tps 
100MB blocks = 700 tps 
1000MB = 7000tps 
When will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min.So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data. 2MB debate is null and void because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly. Increasing block size pulls the voting power out from the knowledgeable user in that it makes it near impossible for them to run a node (would be 20k to run a node if MB is increased too drastically) and 'vote' with what software they want for the protocol. If there's only companies running the nodse then they will determine what get's upgraded within the code, so, for example, they could raise the 21 million limit.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). Why are we delaying this simple simple answer with politics? There is no way in a million years can Bitcoin work without 2nd layer solutions.
Raising the block size limit would destroy node count and centralize nodes even more so: Cornell Study Recommends 4MB Blocksize for Bitcoin:

@_date: 2018-02-18 19:45:34
the idea that you can only use an LN channel to transact with a small number of 'certain people' is incorrect.
You can transact with anyone else connected to the network.
the idea that on-chain fees (i.e. to open/close LN channels) will remain at the current ridiculous levels is an unreasonable assumption that ignores all the scaling currently in progress to combat that very problem
the idea that channels would be regularly opened/closed is incorrect - most people would keep their channel(s) open indefinitely There is no 'locking up'. This is FUD spread by those who don't like LN as a scaling solution.
If you take money out of your bank account and put it in your wallet, would you consider that 'locking it up'? No, you're actually making your money more usable.
With BTC in a wallet, you can make payments via the blockchain (slow, requires non-neglible fees, requires confirmations, not very private). With BTC in LN, you can make cheap, instant, more private payments to anyone on the LN network (which, at least theoretically, will be anyone with bitcoin).
If for some reason you need your BTC back in a standard wallet, you just transfer it back with a regular bitcoin transaction. You'd only really need to send money back to a regular wallet for saving/storage, so waiting for an on-chain transfer is never going to be a concern. The only other scenario for wanting to move money back to a wallet if to then make an on-chain payment with the funds...which is an odd edge case, as it would almost always make more sense to make the payment via LN.
1) You don't have to open a channel with everyone in town. Just a few channels might be sufficient. This is the "network" part of the "lightning network", if you want to pay someone, but don't have a direct channel with them, you can send the payment through one of your existing channels, which will forward the payment hopping through other people's channels until it reaches its destination. (ex: You have a channel with Alice, you want to pay Bob, but you do not have a channel with Bob. However Alice &amp; Bob are connected, so you send the payment to Alice, and ask her to forward it to Bob on your behalf). Best of all, this happens in a trustless and non-custodial manner, i.e. intermediate nodes cannot steal the in-transit payment (thanks to a cryptographic contract called the "Hashed Time-Lock Contract").
Also, you do not need to fill a channel with everything you expect to spend, because you can refill the channel through the network. Example: You open a $20 channel with Starbucks, you spend everything. Then let's say someone pays you through Lightning for some small service, their payment can arrive through your Starbucks channel which will now be refilled. Sweet, more coffee! (or something else, you don't necessarily have to use that channel only to pay Starbucks)
2) No need to close a channel to spend coins in it. If Starbucks wants to spend the coins they received from your channel, they can pay someone else using you as a router. (ex: they refill your channel, and in exchange you use some other channel of yours to route their payment to someone of their choice). The only reason to close a channel is if the other party become unresponsive, which hopefully would be infrequent enough to not be a huge problem.
Even in that case, in the future we will have "channel factories" which are a way to open/close payment channels off-chain, which will further optimize and reduce the costs of the whole process, dramatically reducing the need to pay miner fees.
It's obvious we need second layer solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). There is no way in a million years it'll scale onchain. Bitcoin will work without 2nd layer solutions, but the 'cash' component will come with that adoption.
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.

This is a completely inaccurate statement. I don't think you appreciate how important full nodes are. They dictate how the protocol progresses and  _we_ the people running the nodes vote for that depending on what software we choose to run. The 'vote' actually counts! Not miners. Not SPV wallets. Not website wallets, but **FULL** nodes. Where you around for the softfork this is how it happend...
"Full nodes run by a reasonable number of users and business to validate the payments they receive need to be upgraded to Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 or above, or another segwit-compatible implementation in order to incentivize miners to follow segwit’s rules after segwit activates. (This is Bitcoin’s normal incentivization mechanism where miners only receive income for generating a block if they follow all of the consensus rules, which will include the new segwit consensus rules once segwit activates.)"


I don't see it as failing, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt...In that case, **Fail forward** and iterate this is exactly how Bitcoin is improving. The evolution can only benefit from its immunity system it's building.

@_date: 2018-02-11 16:16:58
I'm not sure you understand that fees are and were working as intended.
Let me explain why fees are important
**The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space**. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a "fee." It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low-value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low-value transactions, it intrinsically favors high-value transactions. This is because for high-value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low-value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high-value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage-wise. For low-value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high-value transfers over low value transfers. The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
**Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network**. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
No. **That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network**. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
**What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap**.

To be a pyramid scheme, Bitcoin would have to be an organization, rather than a currency, as pyramid schemes' central idea is that the individual makes a profit proportionate to how many others they recruit into the organization.
To be a ponzi scheme, Bitcoin would have to be a fund where new money from fresh buyers is disguised, through creative accounting, as profit for the older buyers.
Bitcoin is neither of these. It's opensource and pseudo-anonymous. By its design/nature it's transparent. The Bitcoin ecosystem provides a new technology (the blockchain) that solves a legitimate problem (mutable ledgers, trust and accountability).
But this is very difficult to explain to people who do not have a background in mathematics, software engineering, and/or cryptography. Apart from actually teaching your friends high-level concepts from these subjects, there is not much you can do, using pure rationality, to persuade them.

In my experience it caters to the average facebook user. The service uses a straightforward method to pay anyone else that has signed up with the service. It leverages a social media-style feed to show people making transactions to one another, kind of lame in my opinion, but I see what they are "doing". 
It's relatively easy to set-up with a nice UI. I had issues with it unfortunately and had disdain for it right away because with my love affair for bitcoin. However, they have all the limitation that any other service that needs comply with the antiquated, bureaucracy when dealing with a third-party entity (bank). 
I'm kind of glad and intrigued to see how Circle progresses with this move. It could be an easy way to onboard the average facebook user with bitcoin who might initially use the service for fiat payment with friends and family.

Give me one altcoin that is better than Bitcoin on just one of these 3 ( Decentralization,Security and Speed of Transactions) but still doesn't compromise on the other 2. Bitcoin is the most balanced—that's what matters.Look again, no they do not. This is why Bitcoin maximalists consider altcoins to be essentially worthless. Their properties aren't real. Anything about them can be changed if they are centralized. Anything about $XRP can be changed at the whims of Ripple the company.
Because bitcoin is at a much large scale, bud. Do you even know how this space works? You can't get to the scale with bitcoin without handing over sovereignty if you want fast transactions. That's why we're implementing second layer solutions while remaining decentralized.

**YOU ARE BEING HOODWINKED**
**This is not a compromise.**
Agreement is:
We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades to the bitcoin protocol, which will be deployed 
simultaneously and based on the original Segwit2Mb proposal:
Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4
Activate a 2 MB hard fork within six months
They forgot the part where SegWit activation needs to be mandatory or else this is not a compromise at all.
Who’s writing the code for the 2MB hardfork if SegWit never activates?
Who’s vetting that code?
Why not draw up a 6 month timeline where SegWit + 2MB both occur on a certain date?
Because this is not a compromise.
They all know Jihan/Antpool/Bitmain will never signal for it, and they control more than 20%.
There is no compromise unless SegWit is made mandatory.

No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min.So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data. 2MB debate is retarded because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly...It's obvious we need layer 2 solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well).
Ethereum does not work with the release of JUST one successful ICO, it's fundamentally flawed and can't handle traffic—people are now finally realizing this.
"network congestion" is a huge deal at the end of the day—bringing eth to its knees and collapsing all those 'cool' features you are speculating on. Ethereum can handle around 15 Ts./sec before transactions are rejected. You might think: “Well, that’s more than Bitcoin with 7 Ts./ sec” but here’s the catch: Ethereum is not about coin transactions only, the founders sold the project as the world’s universal computer to handle everything from decentralized Ubers to P2P-cloudstorage and more. According to their community there’s absolutely no limit to what this brilliant system will achieve. Maybe it’s time to see where things are today. How far is sharding away from implementation? Two years at its earliest? The network is headed for around 200k “transactions” a day. A number Bitcoin saw around a year ago. Notice the exponential rise over the last few weeks, where is it coming from? The price of ETH is 1 factor for sure, but as devs start to make websites like “Etheroll” things add up quite fast. A 12 second block only allows for 180 transactions. This means that 200 active gamblers can take up all the Ethereum mining resources. And this is just 1 Dapp

Dan Larimer has always been intellectually dishonest about DPoS. The Bitshares and Steem whitepapers describing the Graphene engine only talk about rather local optimizations when describing how they can achieve thousands of transactions per second. In this context, this metric would rather compare against Oracle clusters and the like (where they would lose, of course, impossible to compete with decades of domain knowledge in this field).
The question about the security trade-offs when achieving their transaction throughput, which is the *actual* issue to look at in the blockchain domain, is left unaddressed. Or, to put it more simply: Why is it a blockchain at all? It's just a database engine. Bitshares, Steem and probably also EOS are run by a fixed and known set of 20 or so validators, also known as "witnesses", probably consisting of Larimer himself and closest cronies, who will of course never behave maliciously. They can be voted in and out by "the community".
This has not much to do with Satoshi's invention after all. There is no decentralization. If you remember that famous centralized-decentralized-distributed graph, the "decentralized" graph is intended to look self-similar no matter where you pan and zoom. This is not the case with Graphene. You zoom out, and you'll have the 20 nodes in the center.
At best there is a niche for this approach, at worst it's intentionally misleading and a scam. The truth is maybe somewhere inbetween, but then you have to ask what's the technical benefit over a centralized setup.

Core already has a roadmap which is far more advanced.

You're not considering that you have the ability, on these trading platforms, to trade at a "limited order".  You could trade 0.05 BC, at this moment, for 11USD. 
One Bitcoin is divisible down to eight decimal places. There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible atomic units in the bitcoin design.
The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. In other words, each is divisible by up to 10^8.As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grows too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people can start dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).

There are two main benefits that traders provide the economy:
1. Price Discovery
2. Liquidity
Price Discovery
What is the ideal price for a stock? No one really knows. But, by the wisdom of crowds we would arrive at a much better guess. Trading freely would provide much better mechanism to discover prices that way. Just like neurons working on a network make us smart, the market is smart through the interaction of million of these traders. 
In markets such as China where there are a lot of trading impediments (where short selling was traditionally banned) the prices go completely nuts and making their markets quite unreliable. Thus, although China is the world's second largest economy, their financial markets are not seen as important. 
As Joseph Wang alludes to, you will invest in the market only when you are completely confident that you can get out of your investment at any time. While you will spend 1000s of dollars in commission and a few weeks of time to sell your home, you will always have buyers for the stock you own and sellers for the stock you wish. 
The constant presence of these traders allows anyone to buy/sell vey easily, and helps build the foundation of capitalism. If people start worrying about liquidity, markets would cease to function (like it did during Lehmann crash, when mortgage bond liquidity went crazy)

No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min.So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data. 2MB debate is retarded because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly...It's obvious we need layer 2 solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well). Why are we delaying this simple simple answer with politics? There is no way in a million years can Bitcoin work without 2nd layer solutions.
The value of bitcoin is not in it's low fees. Bitcoin never promised low fees, and in fact, it is impossible to have low fees, decentralization, and a fixed cap on amount of coins because the miners need to be compensated somehow. If you make fees low, you either have massive blocks because you need to fit all the transactions that you can into the blocks to make a profit, or you need to increase the block reward/remove the 21M coin limit. And bitcoin will never have "no fees" again anymore, because the block reward is already too small, and will only continue to get smaller. Get ready. On chain fees are the new normal. And $.30 is going to be a pipe dream even if you think you can grow the blocks indefinitely (you can't). The miners know that everyone is willing to pay a lot more than that, and they can select which transactions go into the block. Many of them have their minimum selection criteria of at least $1 now. That will not ever compete with cash/credit card transactions which are free and instant.
And finally, you cannot increase the block size indefinitely. The obvious answer to an untechnical person, for the technical problem of the "block size limit" is to "raise the limit", but that's about as simple as telling a country to "just get more debt". It doesn't work that way. There are tradeoffs. Bitcoin is decentralized, and P2P. You don't need to run a node, but if anyone tells you that you shouldn't you, need to look at them very suspiciously. Think of the ability to run a node like your second amendment. You don't need to own a gun, but the fact that you can is room enough to keep power in check. Simplify that idea with the idea of going back to the beginning of the country, where muskets were all that anyone had... It was an even playing field.
By running a node, you run the rules that dictate your money. You can run whatever rules you want. It is a voluntary economy. If you are not running a node, you are trusting for another node to tell you the truth about your money. You are trusting that they will enforce rules the way you want to. It isn't peer to peer. It is peer to central node to central node to peer. We already have that system. Wells Fargo is my node, and they will pay Visa on my behalf, and Visa will pay the shop owner on my behalf. That system sucks.
**The reason we cannot scale on chain is entirely because of technical limitations:**
Lets take just Visa level transactions from 2016.
1971 tx/s * 600 s/block * 225 bytes per tx = 250MB blocks Every 10 minutes.
Lets assume that you have a fiber connection (most people don't) and you can handle downloading uploading that block. After you download that, you need to store that into RAM, and validate the block, store the block, and then upload that block. And all of this needs to happen as fast as possible. If it takes longer than 10 minutes, you are now messing up the network because you are orphaning blocks. And that's the minimum. Multisignature tx's (ones that have many different inputs) scale quadratically. This means that 250MB block is more like a 1GB block. Every 10 minutes. A regular computer cannot handle that. In fact, many proponents of on chain scaling have already proposed that nodes be run from data centers. Jihan Wu suggested that it shouldn't cost more than $10k. Do you have $10k just laying around to buy the hardware, and then pay for the resources to run that node, when you get no payment from doing so? Miners do. 
And in fact, many have already proposed the idea of having pay-for-access nodes where you literally pay to have access to a node to use bitcoin. So add onto your already existing transaction fee. Starting to sound a lot like the current banking system. And you will still need to wait 10-30 minutes to confirm your transaction. This is just for Visa level transactions. Start adding in worldwide, fiat, wire, credit card, ACH transactions, blocks can easily ballon to over 100GB every 10 minutes. And again, multisig tx's scale quadratically.
Whether you like it or not, on-chain bitcoin absolutely sucks as a currency. It is complicated, slow, 100% traceable, and won't ever be free. Every form of fiat beats that inside and out. However, on chain bitcoin makes for an awesome digital asset, that can settle much, much faster than ACH can (10-30 minutes vs 24 hours). And it has the ability to have many, many payment layers built on top that allow for it to compete with modern day fiat infrastructure. This technology is very close to being developed on other cryptocurrencies, yet there is a stupid debate about wanting to scale on chain, when we can already show that it leads to centralization at basic levels.

It is useful and will be even more so with second layer solutions. It's also useful to be able to run a node and vote, this is a huge reason why increasing the block size is an awful idea.
1MB blocks = 7 transactions per second (roughly) 10MB blocks = 70 tps 100MB blocks = 700 tps 1000MB = 7000 tps when will the increase stop? 10MB? 100MB? No more like 300-1000MB every 10 min.So the bloat to the blockchain for having visa level tps(2000-56,000+ tps) would be so massive there would be no full nodes to run the blockchain except for big players willing to add like 300MB every 10 min...centralizing the network to its death with the enormous packs of data. 2MB debate is retarded because it's just gonna get filled almost instantly...It's obvious we need layer 2 solutions like lightning network( which needs segwit to run well).

That's definitely the secure route to go, but I used my mac and the sites method for printing offline. For the amount that's on there, I'm not overly concerned, and I'm going to demonstrate to him how to transfer the balance to another wallet hosted on blockchain—will be short-lived in cold storage.

I printed it myself using this website:
Unfortunately, I only have a B&amp;W laser jet. I ordered the foil stickers from the above site as well.

And that's why it's a great show. Instead of having the spectacle of the day shoved down your throat from main stream media, you have difficult topics that are hard to tackle. Sometimes it's nice to see alternative sides of the story so you're forced to think critically. It's better propaganda than USA media's propaganda.

Considering you have 100btc I would take the hardfork that you're asking for and **really rethink** my position. The last thing you want to do is a risky hardfork, and that's exactly what will happen if enough people don't run BIP148 and settle for the 'second installation of segwit2x aka the hard fork. 
Be honest with yourself and look at the actual developers and their sentiment. Do you believe you know more or have a better idea than the people actually familiar with the code?

Memes, much like art, are a way to start a discussion without using the confines of language. They also send a message much more effectively than an eight paragraph, a wall of text, post... "A picture is worth a thousand words". It's  essentially advertising the cause. In other words, keep um' coming.

You need to do some kerning on the "100". I'd also consider adjusting the width of the border pattern. Did you reference paper currencies from other countries? It would be worth seeing how they approach their ledger with color,asymmetry  and overlapping elements.

You can't exchange bitcoin for usd? Then how are all the trading platforms working?

hah! essentially, yes. I'm hoping a live demonstration will add to the lesson. He's not too far off, he just bought some stock in Tesla—we've been talking about Elon Musk as well.
