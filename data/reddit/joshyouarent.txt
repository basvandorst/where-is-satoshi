Wow, do you know how long shiels has been accepting btc? I wonder if they do instore.

Nobody really knows.
But I think anything that makes cryptocurrencies in general more affordable/accessible e.g Litecoin/Dogecoin could only be good for Bitcoin.

I did check the transaction actually happened on the blockchain,
All was well. I will try resetting the blockchain. How big is it?
Thanks for your help
Edit: Do I have to export my transactions or Private keys before resetting the blockchain?

It might help if i could google effectively lol 
Thanks for your help though

1. You only need a smartphone for [2 factor authentication]( (any smartphone with a camera will do) 
2. Yes that is why there are so many "alt-coins"
3. Unsure about this but pretty sure bitcoin is perfectly legal in Canada, you may get some weird looks/questions from bank tellers but they shouldn't stop serving you.
