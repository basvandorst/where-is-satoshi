Unfortunately, I don't think we'll ever be able to share battery power through a blockchain, and it's already possible with a cable. Maybe youll have to pay his altcoin to unlock it with this money grab of a project.

Okay, I guess you'd then have to buy the cpu power from the phone owner using the coin then? But in a communal system wouldn't people then be buying power from you as well making the energy savings moot, unless you choose to not sell yours? 
(I believe) ethereum is doing pretty much exactly this with their coin. We may see datacenters that sustain themselves by selling their processing power, instead of being owned by large companies. (maybe both?) Either way I don't think this guy will get far with these "technological advancements". At least not far in the crypto community.

Yes! I absolutely agree, the technology is super promising and I believe we will see a lot of innovative products in the future that capitalize on blockchain tech. I'm just arguing the selling points that are featured are pretty far from *actual* selling points. Quite a few phones now can "share data, battery power, and processing power" with or without a cable. Sharing processing power between computers is nothing new, and to be able to do it with a phone would be cool, but why in the hell would you do something so process intensive on a phone that you need to harness *other phones*?
The Etherium thing I was talking about was this:  I had remember reading about it and mistakenly believed that this was built-in to Etherium. Pretty cool concept.
