The counter to that argument is *not* trying to prove that Terrorists dont use Bitcoin.. because certainly someday they will, and when they do your argument becomes invalid. The true counter argument is that it doesnt matter if bad guys use Bitcoin. Bad guys use the internet, cars, roads, cell phones, shoes, and all manner of tools to accomplish their ends. Frankly the fact that terrorists dont use Bitcoin is only proof that it isnt good enough yet.

Ugh not this again. Every time Bitcoin hiccups people over-zealously put their space helmets on and convince themselves that we're going to reach obscene new highs for absolutely no legitimate reason whatsoever.
The last few bubbles were almost certainly driven by manipulation in MtGox, and ran wild because there was no good way to short BTC. Those days are over. Don't get me wrong, I would love to see another BTC bubble, but I don't see it happening anything like in the past unless some insane shit happens like a global monetary meltdown. 
Until then, I'm enjoying the (relatively) slow and steady gains. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 06:25:12
You make some really good points. 
As much as I'd love to see one as a Bitcoin holder, I'm not sure we're going to see another huge bubble in Bitcoin price like the past though. Previous bubbles were influenced by exchange manipulations from a single dominating exchange (MtGox), and there weren't any good ways for more savy traders to short Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin has matured quite a bit since the last major bubble, and I would be surprised to see another super bubble. Here's to hoping I'm wrong though :)
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:19:17
I think Bitcoin would be better off in the long run by being slow and steady with the gains. 10%-15% a year for a few years will give people much more confidence in the longer term value of Bitcoin than suddenly skyrocketing to 1000 only to crash back to 500. I'd rather have a 500 that looked stable than a 500 that people are afraid might go to 250

Actually, *anybody* can re-write it.  Changing Bitcoin is trivial, but getting your changes accepted by the majority of the network is very very very hard.  The source code is open and can be found [here](
Why don't you go ahead and change it?  Ok, now that you've made your changes, how are you going to convince the entire network to accept your changes?  Bitcoin isn't run on a single server somewhere, its run on thousands and thousands of machines all over the world, and people choose to run whatever version of Bitcoin they want.  No changes can be made that the majority of the miners and node operators don't agree with.  It is a democratic process.

I haven't put anything into Bitcoin that I'm not comfortable completely losing.  And this is the same advice I give to anybody considering buying any. 
I know the risks, and I hope that most others do as well.  Bitcoin is very much a Beta test, and it should be looked at as very high risk, very high reward.  
That being said, Bitcoin has crashed, many many times, and it has always recovered.  Bubbles don't crash in value more than 60% and then proceed to recover.  when a bubble crashes, it crashes all the way to the bottom.   If Bitcoin is indeed a gigantic bubble, then it is the most resilient Bubble in history.

I agree that all those things you mention are bad, of course they are, but you're naive if you think anti-money laundering laws do anything to stop them, or lessen them, just like you're naive if you think anti-drug laws do anything to stop drug dealers (they don't), just like the US government was naive when it decided to outlaw alcohol. 
Alcohol is terrible. Its addictive, its responsible for countless deaths and destroyed countless families and careers, and yet, despite its terribleness, experiment showed that we were better off with it LEGAL, because as bad as Alcohol is, the consequences of having it illegal were considerably WORSE. 
As soon as you prohibit something in high demand, it immediately creates a black market for that good or service. Not just any black market, but a highly lucrative one. Highly lucrative black markets inevitably end up spawning organized crime, and organized crime results in massive increases in violence, corruption, and the infiltration of governments and society at all levels. This is exactly what happened during prohibition, and it is exactly what is happening in the war on drugs, with Mexico getting the short end of this stick. The legalization of drugs would immediately cripple these organizations, and they'd eventually wither and die just like the bootleggers did during prohibition. 
We discovered that just because something is bad, doesn't necessarily mean it should be illegal.
There is *significant* evidence that money laundering is in the same situation as alcohol was, and drugs currently are. Do you actually think that the current anti-money laundering laws are even working? No, no they are not. The vast majority of the worlds money laundering occurs in highly regulated banks, like HSBC who was caught [laundering hundreds of billions of dollars for drug cartels]( and BNP, which was caught laundering money for 
[Sudanese militant groups associated with genocide](
Nobody was prosecuted for these crimes, because the entire system is already corrupted and infiltrated. There is too much money flowing through the system to stop it. There will always be somebody (usually many people) willing to accept a bribe, and provide an avenue for illicitly obtained money. Laws cannot stop it, all they do is end up corrupting the system, just like Prohibition.

It doesn't really matter in the long run.  Bitcoin can only be delayed and slowed, but it cannot be stopped altogether anymore than the government can stop people from using the Pythagorean theorem.  
Governments will struggle with this for a while, but eventually they'll come to when they realize the economic benefits that arise when the entire world is connected via a single friction-less currency, and law enforcement agencies will be able to easily track targeted individuals.  
Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature only means that governments aren't able to conduct broad surveillance of entire populations without any warrant or probable cause.  You know, like the constitution is supposed to ensure.  Suspects can have their communications monitored and their Bitcoins tracked quite easily.

6 months ago called and wondered where you disappeared to.. looks like you somehow managed to time travel to the future where this is common knowledge.
Seriously though, the markets are behaving exactly as game theory would predict they behave under the circumstances of no USD withdraws at an exchange.  This will result in an artificially inflated price at that exchange without any manipulation whatsoever, so no need to claim manipulation as an explanation.
Furthermore, when everybody is trying to get the hell out of an exchange, prices will be artificially lower at that exchange as well, so there is nothing suspicious about  this behavior either.  When everybody on an exchange is incentivized to do the same thing (Buy BTC to get money out, or Sell BTC to migrate exchanges), these sorts of things happen.

Of course we don't, and we don't expect to. The reason we don't see brick and mortar shops doing this is because they have already burned money by buying the shop. They cannot move easily, they cannot create 100 shops all over the world with the click of a mouse like they can in the digital realm.
The problem that proof of burn is attempting to solve *only exists in anonymous digital market places*, so you can't sit here and say its wasteful because non-anonymous market places don't use proof of burn. When your name and address are attached to your account like in other marketplaces, then scamming becomes more difficult, and you risk going to jail.
In an anonymous digital marketplace, a seller can automate the creation of new stores at no cost and the system has no way to tell if there are one thousand sellers or only one seller. They can create as many as they want, as there is no barrier to entry at all. Furthermore, in a digital anonymous marketplace, scammers can create so many user accounts and automate so many false review scores that you cannot trust these things anymore. Anything that can be created anonymously, indefinitely, with no cost cannot be used as a source of reputation, and there is only one thing that cannot be created indefinitely at no cost in a digital anonymous marketplace, and that is Bitcoin itself, hence proof of burn.
If you can solve this problem in better way, then by all means let the world know. You'll be renowned and famous, because this isn't a trivial problem, and a lot of people way smarter than you and I have spent a lot more time thinking about this than both you and I, and this is the best they have come up with.

Of course the value is in the payment system. The coin is simply that which must be transferred via this revolutionary new payment system, and therefore the coin is a direct representation of the value of the payment system.

No.  Bitcoin is not regulated by early adopters and whales.  They can influence it via their popularity and such, but Bitcoin stands on its own without levers of power apart from consensus. 
I would argue that Bitcoin has a few very strong regulations which are self enforced by mathematics and consensus.  Its rules and regulations are built into the protocol.  They are open, fair and transparent, and cannot be manipulated by the few.  People who say Bitcoin is unregulated are mistaken.  Bitcoin has regulations that cannot be broken or evaded, unlike the current financial system where regulations only apply to the little people.

51% attacks are not flaws in the code.  This is like saying that the current financial system is broken and will be replaced because fraud can occur (which is essentially what a 51% attack is).  The irony here is that 51% attacks (fraud) are rampant in the current financial system, and yet people freak out at the possibility that somebody with immense power *might* and with a significant potential for massive losses might shoot themselves in the head and commit fraud with Bitcoin... something that happens so frequently every single day with dollars that the system doesn't even bat an eye when it happens. 
Bitcoin is not code.  *It is a protocol* for which there just happens to be a popular version that everybody uses called BitcoinD.  I could write my own entire version of Bitcoin and interact with the network just fine so long as I follow the protocol.  You are essentially saying that the internet is not here to stay because Firefox could have a bug.  
Cryptographic attacks are a possibility, and a threat to Bitcoin, but they are also a threat to pretty much everything else, including your digital identity and all your sensitive personal information.  ECDSA can easily be replaced without too much hassle if it is found to be weak.  SHA256 on the other hand would be significantly harder to replace, and sure that is a legitimate concern, but so is an asteroid wiping out all of humanity.

All value is nothing but a creation of the mind.  The value of food dependent upon the value of life, which is not certain.  Not everybody values their life, and it is not impossible that nobody valued their life.  What was the value of food to the Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were executing a food strike?  It had negative value for them.  There is no such thing as intrinsic value.  All value is subject to the mind.  
Besides, we are discussing economic value, not essentials for life. Economic value is determined by supply and demand.  Air has no economic value in any currency because it is ready abundant and easily accessible.  The *supply* is essentially infinite, and thus its price is zero.  
*Lack of scarcity guarantee's no economic value.*  This isn't some groundbreaking idea here, it is basic supply/demand economics.  Increases in supply result in decreases in value.  As supply goes to infinity, value goes to zero.  That is economics, and that is a demonstrable fact.

Exchanges work by holding all the bitcoins from all their customers in a single pool.  This means that they have control of the Bitcoins, not you.  This means trading bitcoins is just updating an entry in their database, which makes it instant.  After you have finished trading, you can then withdraw your bitcoins, similar to how you would a bank account, and then you now control the bitcoins because you have the private key for them.  
TLDR:  If you don't have the private key then you don't have the bitcoins.  If you have the private key, then you have the bitcoins and nobody can take them unless they get the key.

Who decides if the English language will change? Ultimately it is the people who use the language who make this decision. It is done by the consensus of the population. Government officials, or Dictionary publishers can try, but languages are controlled by the people. Bitcoin is quite literally, a language (a protocol). It can only change if the majority of those who use it collectively decide to.
Anybody can propose a change. But for those changes to be adopted in the network, those changes have to be *voluntarily* adopted by everybody who is running Bitcoin software.

I'm not a trader, but this is what I have to say:

2) Day trading is not nearly as simple as you seem to be implying. Yes, Bitcoin could go up $50 and you could make some money, but it is just as likely to go down, possibly significantly, causing you to panic sell at a major loss.
3) Day traders do this for a living, and you're chances of succeeding long term against them is slim. 
4) Don't day trade. Do what helraizr says: buy, hold, and spend some on occasion when you see an opportunity.

My issue with your comment wasn't when you stated that encryption is superior to secret physical locations. That is obviously true. My issue was this assertion:


This is utterly false, as has been demonstrated many many times. The encryption is indeed pretty much unbreakable as far as we know, but the most successful ways of discovering a private key involve completely circumventing encryption altogether. (Key logger etc) 
Keeping private keys properly hidden is not a trivial task, and encryption is only a part of the security chain.

There is no way to get from a value of zero, to where Bitcoin is headed (a very high value) without periods of massive volatility, and rest assured, there will be more massive volatility in the future.  These are simply the growing pains of a nascent global currency, and they aren't going to stop any time soon.

That's because free software is generally fighting an uphill battle against economic incentives.

There is simply too much money driving cutting edge features and paying for massive teams of the elite developers. Hobbyist developers are not likely to be able to compete in these scenarios.
Linux is probably the most successful open source project, but that shouldn't be a surprise because it has significantly more funding and corporate support than any other open source project. 
Now, seeing as how "only a Sith deals in absolutes", there are certainly scenarios where open source works as good or better (Stockfish chess engine), but if you think that OSS is the best solution for every piece of software ever made, and that ever will be made, well then I'm going to go ahead and call you a Sith, because economic incentives do not support this idea.

We are still in the early years of Bitcoin, where adoption will outpace the growth in supply. This is not a bug, it is a feature, and a critical one if Bitcoin is going to go mainstream.

The only things the common folk really need to know about Bitcoin is:
1) It has a market value
2) It can be traded over the internet without a third party intermediary, and without exposing sensitive information
3) Payments cannot be reversed or undone
4) It is controlled and enforced by algorithms, without the need for a governing body
Private/public cryptography, mining, and the byzantine generals problem are just as relevant to the common user as Virtual Memory is to PC users.

Yes, this can absolutely happen without replacing fiat.  But it won't happen until there is a closed loop in the ecosystem, where producers sell products to merchants in Bitcoin, merchants sell those products to buyers for bitcoins, and buyers are paid by employee's in Bitcoins.  Once you have a large enough closed loop like this, then the system becomes self sustaining, and it becomes self-referential (prices are fixed in BTC).

The folks at Gox are paying for something that they may never get, so I wouldn't exactly call that a discount.  When I pay for my bitcoins, I actually get them.  If actually getting what you pay for is a "premium" then you have an interesting definition of the word.

I'm not convinced that a society can fully function without some form of a central government. There are just too many problems in society that (so far) don't have good distributed solutions. As I see it, the biggest problem with centralized governments isn't their existence, but their ability to work in secret, without being held accountable to the public for many of their actions. 
Police officers behave very differently when their actions are publicly monitored and recorded. Abuse of power is difficult when your actions are being scrutinized by those who entrusted you with said power, and can take it away.
I think *extreme* transparency would completely reshape the way governments function. If citizens were able to see the inner workings of government in action, most would be appalled at what they saw, and insist upon reforms.

Corporations like E-bay make a freaking boatload of money, and where do you think all that money comes from? *They take it from the people who are buying and selling*. Open Bazaar will give all that money back to the buyers and sellers. If you don't think that's worthwhile, well then apparently you don't understand that people like money, and if there is a way where they can make more of it, they tend to use that way. 
All of the services offered by places like E-bay can be offered via multi-sig escrow transactions via individuals and companies who will be heavily competing for prices, services, and customer satisfaction. E-bay has a monopoly on escrow services on its site, and they act like it.
Furthermore, there is a lot of demand for a BITCOIN marketplace. E-bay doesn't accept Bitcoin, and neither do most people on craigslist. People are looking for a place to spend their Bitcoin to buy random goods and services, or advertise their goods and services for Bitcoin, and Open Bazaar will provide that.

I really like the idea behind open bazaar, but I'm frankly unimpressed with the incredibly sluggish performance of the application thus far. As is usually the case in development, performance is usually addressed only after the architecture of the system has already been decided upon, and at that stage some performance problems are endemic. I'm not saying this is the case with Open Bazaar, but I've got a hunch because I'm generally pessimistic by nature. Hopefully the team can figure this out.

Also, let them no that there are no charge-backs, and that the fee is less than what they are currently paying to the credit card companies.

I can, and have, rebutted nearly everything in this article with verifiable facts.  I don't mind debating an informed individual, who actually has an understanding of Bitcoin.
There are plenty of legitimate reasons to think Bitcoin will fail, but the author has not proposed any of them because he is completely ignorant of what Bitcoin is fundamentally, which is a protocol, not a currency.
A degree in economics is not sufficient to understand Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a technology, and if it fails, it will be for technological or mathematical reasons, not economic.  At its core, it makes possible things which *have never been possible before*:  Trustless exchanges, trustless notarization, trustless asset management, trustless voting, and many more things are now possible due to this same technology.  Bitcoin the currency is simply the first app on top of this protocol, and you will see many more.  
Bitcoin cannot be uninvented anymore than the Pythagorean theorem can be un-invented.  It's not going anywhere, and it will always exist.

Because pools are not part of the code. The network thinks each pool is a single miner.
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:17:34


Your logic doesn't hold up in this example because private school profits are directly correlated to how well they educate kids. People generally aren't going to pay money for a product if that product doesn't deliver. Private schools live and die by their reputation for education.  
I don't have any problem with private schools. They tend to educate students better than public schools, and pay teachers more. For those who want to pay the extra money that this requires, they should be entitled to. 
Profits are *usually* a good incentive for providing a good or service (so long as competition is strong, which is critical). Highly competitive markets drive prices down, and innovation up, as corporations clamor for customers. This creates a highly efficient system. 
Problems arise in corporations when the incentive structure of profits first create conflicts of interest in the good or service that is provided. This is problematic in markets like healthcare insurance, where the best plan to maximize profits is to only offer services to customers who are less likely to make claims. Health insurance companies have an incentive to discriminate against those who need insurance the most. 
Furthermore, the very nature of insurance is such that the larger the pool of customers, the more efficient the system. This property doesn't mix well with the free market requirement that competition is high for an efficient system, as high competition inevitably results in a highly fragmented market, which means smaller pools of customers, and less efficiency.

Apple cannot create a bitcoin copy, and it would be stupid for them to do so. Bitcoin has no central issuer and no controlling body. Apple would gain nothing from creating their own version because they couldn't control it. If they changed it so that they can control it, then its no longer bitcoin and it loses all of the important attributes that bitcoin has. Bitcoin is trusted because it cannot be controlled, and because it has no agenda. An apple currency would be controlled by apple, and its agenda is to make apple money. It wouldn't be a global currency, it would require personal information to sign up, apple would be there in the middle of all transactions taking a cut and denying transactions that could get it into legal trouble. Apple CANNOT legally make a product with all of the properties that Bitcoin has. It is not possible, and even if it were, why the hell would anybody trust the largest corporation in the world to maintain a currency?That's the entire point of Bitcoin you are missing.. People and middle men are replaced with Math. The laws of men can be, and are routinely broken. The laws of math cannot be broken. We don't need apple anymore, and we don't need any third parties. I trust math more than Apple, and anybody who does otherwise is a fool.

You need to understand that all value is nothing but a creation of the mind.  It is nothing more than an agreement between members of society.  There is no need to explain the why or the what, it doesn't matter.  If society suddenly all agrees that sea shells have value, then bam, they have value.  If society suddenly decides that dollars have no value, or gold has no value, then bam, it has no value, period.  
There is nothing "valuable" right now that couldn't theoretically be deemed to have no value, or little value, tomorrow.  Nothing.  Even food under the right circumstances can have no value.  Just ask the inmates at Guantanamo bay who executed a food boycott.

It's called a multisig transaction, and basically what it does is make it so that a transaction can begin between three people, and only complete when at least two of those three agree. This means that buyer and seller and a trusted third party of reputation can initiate a transaction. At this point the seller sends his goods to the buyer. When the buyer receives the goods, he releases the money to the seller. If there is a disagreement, then the third party picks a side and either releases the funds back to the buyer or to the seller. The difference between this and other escrow services is that with bitcoin, the third party never has full control of the funds in escrow. They can only release them back to the buyer or seller, and that is the extent of their control.

You're missing the fact that Dorian can't write and speak English well enough to be Nakamoto.  If you think the author of both of these is the same person, well then I can't help you:
Leah could have easily recorded her encounter with Dorian and proved he said such a thing, but of course she didn't, and we only have her word to go off of.
So basically, all the evidence that Dorian is Nakamoto can be summed up to this:
1) They share the same name
2) Leah claimed he admitted he was involved with Bitcoin, while simultaneously stating that his brother said he would never admit to it.
That's it.  No more evidence at all.  Meanwhile, the evidence to the contrary is much stronger.

Lol so let me get this straight.  The fact that something happens "all the time" means that it has no scarcity?  Fact of the matter is that the supply of sex is less than the demand for it (generally), otherwise hookers wouldn't exist.  
Your logic would also mean that food is not scarce, because people eat it every day.  And it literally grows out of the ground!  And water is not scarce, because it falls out of the sky!  And yet, it is scarce enough that we trade our scarce money for it.  Food and water are scarce, but they are relatively cheap for most people (at least in the US).  This just means that there is ample supply, but not infinite.  Scarcity is *low* for food. not non-existent.

Its not irrational.  Bitcoin is doing exactly what it has always done.  The good news we are getting was already factored into the price, and realizing that good news doesn't result in increases as it was already priced in.  Furthermore, a lot of investors are into bitcoin for the volatility.  Volatility creates big opportunities for massive gains very quickly.  When volatility decreases, these people leave until the next surge comes around and the juicy volatility that comes with it.  Bitcoin is doing *exactly* what it has done in the past after huge price rise.  Nobody should be perplexed at all by this behavior, in fact [I predicted this drop earlier today before it happened](

The price of any good or commodity is not reflective of what it is worth, it is reflective of what it is *expected to be worth*.  
Prices are all about *expectations*.  It is only unexpected good news that causes the price to go up, and unexpected bad news that causes it to go down.  If there is good news, and the price doesn't budge, it is because that news was already factored into the price.
Also, Bitcoin appears to work like the tectonic plates deep within the earth.  The pressure builds and builds, until it is all released at once in the form of a giant earthquake, when all the pent up motion is suddenly released.  The key is to simply hold out until the next big earthquake, because not much motion tends to happen in between, regardless of the news.

These are trivial issues that don't matter, even to ordinary people.  A soccer mom doesn't care if the units of her wealth are called satoshis or millibits.

Prices of goods and services *going down* is not a problem the soccer mom is concerned about believe it or not.

If we want to use our imagination, then the greatest impact Bitcoin *may* have on the world is by providing a template to solve problems in a decentralized, trustless way that have in the past required hierarchical and centralized structures of power and authority.
It is my firm belief that the greatest problem facing humanity is corruption and abuse of power, as it is the sad nature and disposition of nearly all people, that as soon as they get a little power, they immediately begin to exercise unjust dominion.
Humanity has experimented with various solutions to this problem, ranging from trying to find the most trustworthy individuals, to things like democratic republics which attempt to distribute power among groups of individuals who can act as checks and balances. Some solutions are better than others, but the idea of removing people from the equation entirely and letting an open and transparent algorithm take their place has the potential to revolutionize society. 
I think it is becoming clear that the more centralized power and authority a system has, the more vulnerable it is to corruption, and Bitcoin is currently treading uncharted waters by demonstrating that automated decentralized systems are a very promising solution to this age old problem.

Mining pools are made up of tens of thousands of individual miners all joined together in agreement.  If a miner doesn't agree with what his mining pool is doing, he leaves and joins one that does in a matter of minutes.  Any pool that does something stupid will immediately be abandoned.  Mining operators cannot force changes on miners. 
Furthermore, you are wrong is assuming that miners are all that's important.  Miners can't do shit without the Bitcoin *nodes* that give them transactions.  A forking war of miners vs nodes would be won by the nodes, hands down, because the rogue miners wouldn't have any transactions relayed to them, and the miners who sided with the nodes would collect all the transactions.  The system would be forked into two versions, and the *merchants and users* would decide which of the two blockchains *has value*, and which doesn't.  Miners can go create their own alt-coin sure, but the market will determine which of the two coins has any value on the exchanges, and miners will continue to mine the coin with the most value and long term promise, so miners don't have as much power as one would think.
As I said, it takes the entire network to approve changes, not just the miners.  Miners cannot unilaterally do whatever they want.  Ultimately it is the merchants and users who will decide which forking change retains value in the event of a fork.
Changing the Bitcoin protocol is difficult *even when everybody agree's that they want it to change*. 
Also, miners are heavily invested in Bitcoin, and it would be stupid of them to dilute its value when they are more invested in it than most.  Miners will always have incentives to mine, even after ~125 years from now when the last Bitcoin is mined, as the majority of mining profits will come be from transaction fee's before the last Bitcoin is ever mined.

Central banks give governments the power to give and take wealth as they please, which is a terrible thing for some, and a great thing for others.  It's really a two edged sword.  If you live in the US, you're probably thinking the system is great, but if you live in Greece, or Argentina, or Venezuela, or Zimbabwe just to name a few, you're probably not to keen on the idea.

I don't think it matters that much in the end if Bitcoin does get watered down (and it probably will), because there is one feature of Bitcoin that cannot be watered-down, which is that no transaction can be prevented, and no address can be frozen.  This means that even if Bitcoin ends up being co-opted by business and government, it can still be used to seamlessly and easily purchase an anonymous alt coin.  Bitcoin simply then becomes the door to anonymity, instead of anonymity in and of itself.

There is no consensus on what Bitcoin is because it is in a category all its own.  Bitcoin is a commodity, currency, payment system, peer to peer social network, globally distributed unalterable asset ledger, a protocol, and a technological breakthrough in computer science that for the first time in history allows a distributed digital system to achieve consensus at scale.  
Bitcoin is all these things, and at the same time none of them.  It is all things things together in one cohesive system, and it cannot be defined, explained or modeled by any of its sub components.   
What you are trying to do is say: Hey Bitcoin has properties of a currency! So let me apply all I know about currencies and try to model is as one.  Not gonna work, because has there ever been a currency that is also a ground breaking global payment system?  Has there every been a currency that can be stored in your head by simply memorizing a very long number? Has there every been a currency that has an algorithmically predictable supply? Has there every been a currency that allows me to transact with anybody in the world without them knowing who I am, and without me knowing who they are, and without requiring me to divulge sensitive personal information? 
Nope, Bitcoin has value because it allows people to do things that they cannot do without it.  That is the very definition of value.  Furthermore, the network effect, a property it gets from the fact that Bitcoin is a protocol and a social network, give it a HUGE advantage over any competitors like dogecoin.

You are making a standard econ 101 mistake here dude.  You are conflating the unit of supply with the divisibility.  
One Bitcoin is currently divisible to 10 million individual units, which makes for a total of 12 *quadrillion* units of available supply (currently).  So, the supply of units in the Bitcoin system is actually GREATER than the supply of cents in the world.  Thus you should see the failure of your argument.

Yes it is decreasing from the massive November/December swings, but historically Bitcoin has had a stair step like function of volatility, where pent up demand is suddenly released in a massive surge of buying, usually kicked off by some moderately good news.  Volatility will probably continue to decrease until the next massive surge.  My point is that these surges/crashes will continue until there is more certainty around Bitcoin and its future.  The current state of relative stability is simply following what Bitcoin has done historically after massive price swings.

When a factory automates its production, and lays off its workers, it does so because the machines can produce widgets faster and cheaper than the workers. This causes the consumer price of said widgets to plummet. Yes, a few hundred people have lost their jobs, but simultaneously, the number of people who can now afford the widget has increased dramatically, far surpassing the number of people who lost their jobs, resulting in a net good for society.

No way in hell they agree to create a competitor to the dollar. I think its certainly possible that a small group of government researchers created Bitcoin (similar to how US Navy researchers created TOR), but if such is the case, then I'm going to assume they did this on their own time, and not part of some government program.

User adoption is up, merchant adoption is up, and companies like Coinbase and Circle are creating a global infrastructure that will let common folk from all over the world easily acquire Bitcoin. There will eventually be services that use Bitcoin as the transport layer where sender and receiver need not even know or care that Bitcoin was used.

I'll just say that *distributed* 'governance' by *consensus* is not the same as *centralized* governance by *centralized authority*. Nobody ever claimed that Bitcoin doesn't need governance as the article suggests. The claim is that Bitcoin is resistant to **centralized** governance.

Yes, I'm fully aware of OJ's former wealth, but that's not the point. OJ didn't get off because the FBI was afraid of his power.

Let me give you an example. Public keys are non-reversible, meaning it is not possible to look at an address, and determine what its associated private key is. So, if you send a bitcoin to the address: 
I know that this address wasn't randomly generated from a private key because the probability of finding it is essentially zero. So I can safely assume that if you send money to that address, you don't have the private key for it.
Apart from this, I believe that there are actually addresses which have no mathematical mapping, and thus can never be created anyway.

bitcoin is not anonymous.  You're solving a problem that doesn't exist.  If the government wants to track your Bitcoin transactions, they'll wiretap your internet and phone and find out.  The government can still do targeted surveillance because Bitcoin is built on top of the internet, and the internet is not anonymous by any means.
The psuedonimity of Bitcoin is important more for fungibility than anything else.  You remove it, and bitcoin will lose its fungibility, and it will give everybody in the world access to everybody's financial information.  Privacy is a right, and until there is some suspicion of wrong doing, surveillance should be prohibited.  Bitcoin follows this idea quite well.

If Government can do better, then people will let the government do it.  If Bitcoin or Bitcoin-like systems can do better, then people who use those systems.  The point is that free market competition will determine what is best, and there are few scenarios where governments have been able to beat out *competitive* free markets in efficiency and user satisfaction.  Key word here is competitive.  Without competition, "free" markets are as bad or worse than government solutions (look no further than the state of internet service in the US as an example of this)
There simply no way a government solution can compete against a free market with ample competition which drives innovation and intensive battles for customer loyalty.  Government entities don't have to prove themselves by enduring these refining forces.  They are bureaucratic, slow, and have little to no incentives to innovate because they usually have stable revenue streams regardless of what they do.

Price is not the most important aspect of Bitcoin.  Liquidity, volume, and velocity are far more important in the long run.  Merchant adoption increases the liquidity and utility of Bitcoin, as well as its authenticity in the eyes of the public.  The old days where Bitcoin had little practical utility are over, and with more and more merchants actually accepting Bitcoin, people will be more likely to accept Bitcoin from others as payment, and this will increase the trust in the currency as people with have a greater belief that they will be able to use the Bitcoin that they have purchased for goods and services.

Eesh dude, sounds like you have an addiction. You need to set boundaries according to the level of risk you are willing to take, and stick to them.


Bitcoin the network and payment system has risen significantly in the last year, despite the substantial price drop. From this you should conclude that due to the highly speculative nature of *bitcoin the commodity*, the price is only marginally attached to the level of success of *Bitcoin the network and payment system.*  
This means that you should not conclude that just because adoption has increased drastically, that the price will follow (in the short term). 
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:53:45
Ahh, so now you are contradicting yourself.  You are finally admitting that value is quantifiable and "estimated".  
So, now that you agree that value is quantifiable, you must also agree that the market price *is the estimated value*.  
Without scarcity, there is no estimated value, because it is zero.  You can't quantify the value of sunlight because it doesn't have one, despite being needed.  It won't have a value until it becomes scarce, at which time markets will estimate its value based on supply, demand, and accessibility.  
Scarcity cannot be divorced from value.  Period.  There is nothing that has value that is not scarce, and nothing that is in infinite supply and easily accessible that has value, despite being needed.

In my view, one of the main problems with our representative form of government is the representative. I think a direct democracy/representative democracy hybrid would be preferable. The representative would vote for only those who did not choose to vote themselves. This way, the public could quickly bypass representatives for those issues they feel strongly about.

Why don't you explain to me how something with infinite supply can have value at all.  In a debate you need to provide evidence for your claims.

Thus it follows logically that value is inversely proportional to supply.  Go ahead and give me a logical counter argument.  I dare you.

The thing that most people miss when they explain mining is the whole reason it exists in the first place.  People *need to understand the problem before we try to explain the solution.*  This problem is the double spending problem:  In the digital world, there is no scarcity.  Anything can be copied and recopied as many times as one desires, since all data is just ones and zeros.  
Historically, solving the double spending problem required using a central database that kept track of the state of all the accounts, and ensured that no account broke the rules  and double spent any funds.  This is a problem however, as whoever is in charge of this central database has the power to do whatever they want, they have to be trusted because there isn't a good way to verify that they aren't cheating the system.  Second, a centralized system also creates a single point of failure.  If the database goes down for any reason (earthquake, government raid, power outage etc), then the system goes down.  
Bitcoin solves the centralization problem by using a distributed model.  In a distributed model, you can easily solve the double spending problem by simply having each member of the system vote on what the current state of the system is, and then have the most votes represent the official state of the system.  The problem with this is that there is no way to ensure a fair vote in digital systems.  IP addresses can be spoofed, etc etc.  The blockchain solves this by using computing power, something that cannot be spoofed as a form of voting.

So the scammer burns a bunch of BTC, and then scams some people, and his review ratings plummet and nobody trusts him anymore, and he now has to create a new account, and burn more BTC in the process. Legitimate merchants will have high user reviews, together with a significantly higher burn. 
successful merchants stand to gain a lot by burning, as customers will gravitate toward those who have burned the most, and have high review scores.
If people are smart, they won't buy anything from somebody who has burned less money than the product they are purchasing. Ideally, the merchant will have burned significantly more. I'd feel very safe purchasing a $50 item from a merchant who had burned over $1,000. To a successful merchant, $1000 isn't that much to gain a reputation and a lot of clients.

Your entire premise here is incorrect.  Credit card transactions are not efficient, they only appear that way.  The true test of how quickly a transaction goes through is how long does it take before the receiver of the funds can spend those funds securely knowing that that money is 100% theirs?  This is the true test of a transaction speed, as all credit card transactions are in the *pending* state for at least two weeks after the transaction occurs, as they can be reversed.

Szabo says that reductions in the cost of transportation in a network dramatically increase the value of that network (even more so than Metcalf's law.)The subtle point he is making here (without ever mentioning cryptocurrencies) is that these new technologies represent a potentially massive reduction in the cost the transportation of *value itself.* The effects of which can dramatically increase the overall value of the network we call "the economy".

I'm sorry, but unless inflation is at hyper levels, this isn't true.  Nobody goes to the store looking to buy something because they fear their money won't be worth something tomorrow unless they are in a country experiencing hyper inflation, *and that is a bad thing*.
Did you buy lunch today?  Yes?  Why?  Don't you know that you could have invested that $10 in the stock market and made more money?  Why would you spend money now when you are incentivized to invest it in the stock market? 
Everybody is placed in a situation in which they can either choose to have their money increase in value, or spend it, and they choose to spend it instead of investing it because they are not willing to wait a year for that new i-phone, or that new laptop, or that new car.  People want what they want, and they want it now.  Unless money is appreciating at an alarming rate, deflation has no effect on people's purchasing power.

So to say it is following the exact same pattern is not true.  Bitcoin has had many crashes, Bubbles don't have several massive crashes, they have *the crash*.
Besides, its not like Bitcoin's fundamentals, which are the number of people who use it and accept it, haven't increased.  Bitcoin users *have more than doubled* in just the past two months, and user adoption is off the charts, and showing no signs of slowing down.  When users and merchants stop adopting Bitcoin, then we may be in store for a crash, but until then, all signs point up.

There is no such thing as "intrinsic value".  All value is a creation of the mind.  What is the "intrinsic value" of a Picasso?  or a Rembrant?  It's just a bunch of really old paint on a really old canvas, both of which have no value.. and yet they are universally agreed upon to be valuable.  *Agreement* gives value, nothing else.
People have *agreed* that Bitcoin is valuable for different reasons, but mostly due to the properties that Bitcoin has that set it apart from all other forms of money/payment systems.  Some buy it because they dislike banks, some buy it because they dislike government, some buy it because they want to do micro-transactions over the internet, some buy it because they want to do international transactions, some buy it for day trading speculation, some buy it for long term speculation, some buy it because they are enamored by the technological prowess of it, some buy it because they like the anonymity of it, some buy it because like want to buy drugs, some buy it because they want to do online gambling..

There are an innumerable list of things that humans need to survive.  We need sunlight, we need radiation shielding that the earth provides, we need air, we need temperatures that are not too hot or too cold, we need a planet that is not too large or too small, a sun that is not too close to the center of the galaxy, etc etc.  
The point I am making is that necessity in and of it self has no meaning in economics without scarcity.  Food is only on that list of things you mentioned because it is scarce.  Why did you not mention sunlight? Or air? *Surely these are more 'valuable' than food, because without them food would not exist.*  They are more fundamental, and yet they are neglected from economic discussion.  Why?  Because they have an abundant and easily accessible supply, and for no other reason.  Food and water are more scarce than sunlight and air, and thus we give them more value, even a monetary value, but they are actually *less* valuable than sunlight and air from the necessity point of view that you are pushing.  
You cannot divorce scarcity from value.  Necessity is meaningless to economics without scarcity.  Economics gives no value to anything that is abundant and easily accessible because there is zero demand for it. 
Maslow's hierarchy is not generalized, and thus flawed.  Put a human in a situation with a scarce supply of oxygen and suddenly oxygen is at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy.  Or a world with a scarce supply of sunlight, or a world with few places that are free from harmful radiation, and suddenly these things are at the bottom.  
Do you see the pattern?  Our needs are innumerable, so we focus on those which are *scarce*.  When scarcity changes, suddenly our necessities do as well, but this is wrong.  Our necessities never actually changed, only the scarcity of them has.

Because the NSA does have a limited budget (which we know thanks to Snowden), and anybody who's good at doing what the NSA does (which is spy), will use their budget wisely.

@_date: 2014-07-06 07:53:41


Bitcoin doesn't claim to be anonymous, but if used properly it can be pretty safe. If the NSA has you as a target, there isn't much you can do regardless of what technology you are using. Also, keep in mind that Bitcoin is not a static tool. If there are flaws, and they can be fixed, then they will be. If the flaws can't be fixed, then there's a good chance that somebody creates a different crypto currency that doesn't have said flaws.
The idea that the individual/group who discovered how to create the worlds first distributed crypto-currency, making a breakthrough in computer science in the process, did it as some sort of planned long-con conspiracy to possibly, if everything goes perfectly according to plan, spy on unknown users in ten to fifteen years from then is quite far-fetched. 
The problem with this idea is that Bitcoin has no controlling body or individual. Its course cannot be predicted, and neither can its success. It's based on sound mathematics used in countless other technologies of far more import. It's far more likely that Facebook was invented for that purpose, or Twitter, or Google, as these tools actually have that capability to a degree that dwarfs Bitcoin.
Furthermore, if public-key cryptography is no longer an effective solution, then we have much bigger problems than Bitcoin, as the entire internet, including banking, finance, military etc depend upon it. Bitcoin is pretty far down the list of our biggest concerns if public-key crypto has a zero day.

I can understand your aversion to such an idea, but let me propose a different way of looking at it.
Monetary controls have historically been the primary method that the corrupt, rich and powerful maintain their positions, and forcefully extract wealth from of their citizenry.  
Taking power out of the hands of corruptible central authorities and distributing it among the people (or representatives) is the exact same principle that has allowed democracies to thrive relative to dictatorships or monarchies which have central authorities.  Power corrupts, plain and simple. When power is distributed, corruptibility is mitigated, freedom is increased, and prosperity increases.  
When evil people want to launder money, or receive ransoms, or do anything really, *they don't need a free and anonymous monetary system.* The current system is so corrupted and co-opted that it can be bent to do whatever they want via bribes, collusion, threats, blackmail, or kickbacks.  These things happen because the current system gives great power to a relatively few corruptible individuals who can bypass all the rules, and who are in a position to profit immensely from doing so.  This doesn't even account for all the loopholes and just plain *holes* in the system.  What good are these rules if they are so easily bypassed?
[HSBC]( one of the largest banks in the world, systemically laundered billions of dollars of Mexican cartel drug money over several years, and not a single person went to jail, or was even prosecuted.  
[LIBOR]( the inter bank interest rate which affects everybody in the world, was casually manipulated in collusion among several of the largest banks in the world.  This in and of itself negatively affected nearly everybody in the entire world. 
I could list hundreds of examples of abuses and corruption like these that have had a far far bigger negative impact on everybody in the entire planet than ransoms, which are not even a statistically significant threat.  Have you been kidnapped?  Probably not.  Were you negatively affected by the financial crisis, by Libor, and so many of the other banking scandals recently uncovered?  Absolutely, as was nearly everybody else. 
Bitcoin could be the greatest financial good that society has ever seen, as it replaces corruptible politicians and bankers with simple algorithms that are open, transparent, and verifiable.  Yes, it could be used by bad people, but it is far far more resistant to the much bigger problems the world faces than the current financial system.

I'm a big Bitcoin supporter, but the first thing I do when people talk to me who are interested in buying some is give them warnings.  Bitcoin is young, its unstable, and its risky, that is the truth.  It  holds a significant amount of potential, but it ought to be looked at as a high risk high reward purchase.  
There's nothing wrong with warnings, so long as they aren't misleading about what the real risks are.

Merchant adoption greatly increases the liquidity and utility of Bitcoin, which is a good thing, not necessarily for the short term price of Bitcoin, but for its long term potential as a currency and payment system.  People and merchants will be more likely to hold their Bitcoin instead of exchanging them knowing that they can use increasingly exchange them for goods and services that they need. The price of Bitcoin is a poor metric for its utility.  Merchant adoption, user base, and transaction volume is far more relevant and important.

I don't think this is anything to be really concerned about.  Bitcoin needs to be as conservative as possible in order to be as stable as possible.  I see it inevitable that alternate currencies arise and supplant Bitcoin eventually, but not until after Bitcoin has proven itself and gone mainstream for a significant period of time.  Right now, Bitcoin is the reserve currency of all crypto-currencies, and it will remain that way for a long time imo.

If I had a billion dollars, it would be almost impossible for me to NOT earn more more money than the rate of inflation.  Even modest investments generally gain more than inflation, meaning I am being rewarded with an increasingly larger share of the economy for taking no risk. The reason the wealth disparity is so high, and growing, is because we are literally rewarding people with the most money, and they earn more interest than inflation with zero risk.

The market isn't reacting to the TigerDirect news, or any of the other merchants that are adopting.  It's reacting to the fact that the days of high volatility are officially over, and the high volatility traders went home for another six months when this whole process will start all over again, and they can make massive profits again.  The price of Bitcoin is mostly speculative, not based on fundamentals, and this seemingly irrational behavior reflects that.  I've been waiting for this drop for a while now, and as I said in my post earlier today before this happened, I think it will probably drop into the mid to low $700's, then if the china news isn't terrible on the 31st, perhaps go back up to the high $700's or low $800's, and who knows if the china news is bad.

multisig is a far far better solution to this problem than the current chargeback


It is far from pointless. It is *they key feature of bitcoin* because when a single centralized entity validates a transaction, that is a single point of failure, a single point of control, and a single point of censorship, and a single point of trust. 
The entire point of bitcoin is a distrubted and redundant system that cannot be shutdown, cannot be censored, and cannot be controlled or manipulated by the elite, and requires no trust.
You don't have to look at much of human history to realize that it is the sad nature and disposition of nearly all men that as soon as they get a little power or authority, they immediately begin to exercise unjust dominion. 
Decmocracy is also incredibly inefficient when compared to a dictatorship or a monarchy. The reason democracy has succeeded is because it is more resistant to corruption due to the inefficient and redundant system of checks and balances, and thus more likely to result in a system that benefits the many more than the few. Efficiency isn't what humanity needs. *Resistance to corruption is.*

There is only one fundamental reason that distributed consensus is better, and that is *corruption*. Ask her why democracy is better than dictatorship. Dictatorships are far more efficient forms of government, as the dictator can do whatever he wants and even effect a lot of good change. The problem is the centralization of power, and its corrupting influences. It is only a matter of time before a benevolent dictatorship turns sour, and when it does, its very hard for society to do anything about it because society has no power, as the will of the many is overshadowed by the will of a few. Democracies are better because they distribute the power among many representatives, and the will of the people is more powerful than in a dictatorship.The more you distribute power, the more likely a system will represent the will of its constituents.

Miners do not control Bitcoin. Miners follow the consumers and merchants, not the other way around. Consumers and merchants are what give the currency its value and create a non-zero demand for it. Miners simply go where demand exists. If miners created their own fork, then consumers and merchants would simply continue using the original.

Hey, I love BTC as much as the next guy, but the idea that Bitcoin will prevent governments from going to war is a complete pipe dream disproved by the thousands upon thousands of years of war that happened before fiat even existed. In fact, war has gone down dramatically since the 1970's when fiat currencies were introduced, and we are now living in the most peaceful era the world has ever known (despite all the conflicts going on everywhere). I'm not saying fiat is responsible for this, by any means (the spread of democracy is a much more likely candidate), but I am saying that removing fiat won't help wars, because fiat never started them in the first place.

They can only seize the currency if they obtain the private key that controls it.  The computer that Ross was using to control the site was acquired by the FBI, and chances are that the private keys were accessible from that computer, or some server that that computer had access to.  So long as you prevent the FBI from obtaining your private key, then they can't touch it.  The site needed automated access to the private key though, so it had to be stored somewhere that could be easily accessed.

The blockchain is the technological innovation that allows Bitcoin to exist.  In order to understand it, you need to understand the problem that it solves: It solves what is known as the "double spending problem" of digital money. 
As I'm sure you know, everything that is digital can be copied and re-copied effortlessly, so creating something that is scarce that is also purely digital is challenging.  How do you prevent somebody from spending copies of their digital money more than once at different locations?  
Up until 2008, the only known way of doing this was with a centralized ledger system that would keep track of everybody's accounts and how much they have.  Since all transactions must be approved by this centralized ledger, it can detect and block any attempts to spend money twice.  
These systems are relatively simple to create, but they have problems.  Whoever is in control of the ledger, has unfettered power over it.  They can do whatever they want and nobody can verify that they haven't cheated the system by giving themselves free money, or denying transactions from enemies, or even removing money from enemies accounts.  You have to *trust* whoever is in charge with immense power.  
Furthermore, governments don't like currency competition, because control over the currency gives governments massive powers that they have no intentions of giving up.  All governments have to do is go in and shut down the computers that control this ledger, and the currency is dead.  This has happened several times with previous attempts at digital money.  
Now, lets say that we don't want to have a centralized ledger of transactions, and we want to make copies of our ledger all over the world so that there is no central point of failure, and no single person can control it.  Simple enough, all we have to do is every few minutes or so we get everybody who owns a copy of the ledger to vote on what the official version of the ledger is (since it is possible that everybody can have a slightly different version).  Whatever version gets the most votes wins, and everybody uses that as the official version.  Nobody can defraud the system unless they manage to convince the majority to follow their version, which is unlikely to happen considering that the consequences of a publicly known attack would destroy the value of all the money in the system.  
So this is great, but there is one problem: As any internet pollsters can tell you, its quite simple for just about anybody to create artificial votes in networked systems.  Votes, like digital money, are easily replicated.  This is where the blockchain comes in.  Bitcoin uses a digital resource for its voting mechanism that cannot be faked or replicated: *computing power*.  Computers in the Bitcoin network vote on the official version of the ledger about every 10 minutes by using their computing power.  Whatever version of the ledger can prove that it has the most computing power backing it up through a mechanism called "proof of work", is accepted as the official version by everybody in the network.  
This creates a system where no single person, entity, or group has control so long as one group or entity doesn't possess more than half of the computing power.  So now you are probably asking how hard could it be to muster up half of the computing power of the Bitcoin network?  Well, the Bitcoin network is currently orders of magnitude more powerful than all the worlds super computers combined, and it is growing in computing power at an exponential rate.  So it would be a very very very very expensive attack, and gain the attacker nothing.
Furthermore, if somebody does manage to gain 51% of the power of the network, they are much better off financially just playing by the rules, as the network rewards them with Bitcoins by doing so.  If anything happened to the system, they would have the most to lose, so there is no financial incentive to conduct an attack, as it would immediately be noticeable.
Anybody can be involved in this "proof of work" voting process, which is called *mining*.  Keep in mind however, that mining these days requires very expensive dedicated hardware, and even the best and latest desktop computers are heavily outgunned.  Miners are rewarded with Bitcoins for their work in securing the network, though unless you have a lot of money to invest in top of the line hardware, you will have difficulty turning a profit.

Dorian didn't create Bitcoin, sorry dude.  The guy can't write/speak English properly.  That in and of itself is damning evidence to the contrary.  The only concrete evidence that he is satoshi is the fact that they share the same name, which isn't evidence at all.  I would love to find out who the real Satoshi is, and I would be fine if Dorian were him, but the evidence is very strong, and mounting, that he isn't.

So long as deflation is moderate, it won't impact spending.  Sure, if prices are dropping by a noticeable amount on a daily basis, then people are going to postpone most purchases that are not necessary, but fact of the matter is that people want their shit and they want it now.  So long as prices aren't dropping considerably, people are going to want that Iphone now.  
You could make the same argument against inflation from the merchants point of view.  Why sell my goods and services today when I can sell them for more tomorrow?  This argument works both ways, and has no merit in either unless there is extreme deflation/inflation.
Furthermore, this doesn't take into account the fact that Bitcoin is the most slippery money ever devised.  It's easier to spend than anything else because there are no impediments to doing so.  Traffic flows more freely on the Bitcoin highway, where there are no tolls.  It creates a whole new class of economy that didn't even exist before because it wasn't possible, as people that couldn't transact suddenly can, and do it in an efficient manner.

You're missing the point.  The point is that you can't compare the price of Bitcoin against the price of dollars or anything else for that matters because its apples and oranges.  One Bitcoin is 1/12,000,000 of the total wealth of its system, while one dollar is 1/11,000,000,000,000 of the total wealth of its system (and decreasing every month).  
A Bitcoin represents a larger portion of a smaller pie of wealth, while a dollar represents a smaller portion of a larger pie.  Looking at their prices and comparing them makes absolutely no sense.  If you want to question the value of Bitcoin, you must question its market cap, not the units of value that the market cap is divided into.


Its not useless at all.  I use it all the time, as do millions of other people on the internet.  I buy stuff online with it all the time.  I send money to friends on the other side of the planet.  I tip people that make good comments, and I've received tips from others for my comments.  This is not possible with any other technology.  Bitcoin allows people to do things that no other technology in the world allows them to do, and its only getting started.   
The internet has been successful because it is an open platform for the *transfer of information.*  Anybody can use it, and all users are equal.  This feature has created a flurry of innovation as competition is worldwide, and middle men are not necessary, and there is no barrier to entry. 
Bitcoin is an open platform for the *transfer of wealth.*  Anybody can use it, and all users are equal.  Like the internet, it makes middle men redundant and unnecessary, and like the internet, there will be a flurry of financial services built on top of it that are simply not possible in the current financial system.
You cannot compare Bitcoin to dollars for the same reason you can't compare the internet to the post office.  The internet is significantly more than just a fancy mail service.  And Bitcoin is significantly more than just a currency.  It is a payment system, it is a commodity, and most importantly, it is a globaly distributed asset ledger that nobody can control, and that everybody can trust, that cannot be modified, that cannot be undone, and cannot be manipulated.  It has the potential to do to the financial services industry the same thing the internet has done to the information services industry, which is completely revolutionize it.
Bitcoin is *the internet of money*.  It is a platform, upon which *money is just the first app*.  There are so many other things that can be built on top of this new technology it is almost mind-boggling.  And the best part is, anybody can do it.  Nobody is sitting at the entrance only letting in a select few who are on the inside.

It's factored into their business model?  Uhh yeah the merchants take a hit to the balls, and it happens all the time.  
A double spend is not trivial to pull off.  Services like Bitpay and Coinbase that most merchants use easily detect them.  Besides, Bitpay and coinbase take the hit anyway in the case that a double spend is successful, not the merchant, unlike credit cards.  So your assumptions here are not correct.
In fact, there is work going on right now in the Bitcoin nodes to relay double spend attempts throughout the network, building detection right into the protocol:
Unless you have the hashing power, double spends are not an issue.

It doesn't matter if Hitler created it intending to enslave the world, because it's open source and it works.
Let me provide an analogy:
Does it matter who created the Pythagorean Theorem? Do you know what Pythagoras's intentions were? Does it matter? No. No it does not, because the Pythagorean Theorem works, and there is nothing hidden or secret going on. It does exactly what it claims to do and nothing more, and everybody in the world is capable of figuring this out themselves. Same goes for Bitcoin. 
Furthermore, the vast majority of Satoshi's code has been replaced, re-worked, or re-vamped. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin is actually a protocol, similar to TCP or HTTP, and there are already multiple versions of it in use, similar to how there are multiple web browsers in use. You could write your own version of Bitcoin and use it just fine. All that matters is that you speak the same language as everybody else.

This whole scenario is backwards. The government should require a warrant to investigate your financial situation, in the same way they require a warrant to investigate your personal possessions. 
The entire premise of the fourth amendment is that a citizens right to privacy should not be violated *unless* there is evidence to suggest wrongdoing, and only then is authorization is provided to the executive branch *by* the judicial branch. 
The framers of the constitution knew all too well that the tools of security and the tools of oppression *are one and the same*, and that in order to prevent the latter, the former needs to be strictly contained. 
We have completely violated this principle, and financial oppression is the result.

You can use multibit or electrum, neither of those require the entire blockchain.  I've tried multibit and its pretty nice.  
I wouldn't rule out wallets like blockchain.info however, as it can actually be safer than a PC wallet because it has more resistance against key loggers due to two factor authentication capabilities.  Furthermore, blockchain.info doesn't hold your coins, and they cannot access them.  Generation of your private keys is all done in the browser, and never transmitted.

Bitcoin is much much more than a simple database. Yes, peer to peer had existed for a long time, but that isn't what makes Bitcoin unique. Peer to peer systems have never had a critical component called *consensus* until the blockchain was invented. This has severely limited peer to peer systems to problems that don't require consensus, or can get by without it. The blockchain enables P2P money (ledgers), P2P exchanges, P2P domain name systems, P2P notaries, P2P asset registers, P2P contracts, P2P voting systems, and the list goes on and on. None of these were possible to implement in a sustainable and resilient manner until the block chain was invented. P2P digital consensus was thought to be an unworkable problem due to the nature of all things digital (spoofing, cloning and copying are trivial) and these attributes are detrimental to consensus.

Wire transfers are centralized and managed by banks, and controlled by governments.  You can't have a distributed P2P system that depends upon such things.  
It's impossible not because of Bitcoin, but because of fiat.  As I said, such a system is certainly possible if we are only trading crypto currencies, but as soon as you add fiat to the mix, you cannot create a decentralized system because now you depend upon banks, and the whole point of this discussion was how governments could shut down exchanges.  If your P2P exchange relies upon banks, then the Gov can shut it down no problem.

This is not possible, because prices of goods and services vary relative to each other.  All the corn crops could be destroyed due to a hurricane, so corn is going to be more expensive due to restricted supply.  
Furthermore, even an algorithmically controlled currency wouldn't be able to maintain prices as some rich dude could suck up half the currency supply and stash it under his mattress.  With half the supply missing, an algorithm would have to print more money to prevent deflation, after which the rich dude dumps his money back on the market, causing inflation, and then you'd have to remove currency from the system.. so who are you going to take it from?

An interesting comparison is democracy vs dictatorship. Democracy is really nothing more than an attempt at decentralizing government by distributing the power among multiple people, groups or "branches". The key point here is that democracy is better not because it is more efficient (it's actually far more inefficient). It's better because the decentralized nature of it is more resistant to corruption and abuse of power. THAT is the key principle. Power corrupts, and the more of it you can spread around society, the better off everybody is.

This is not true, either theoretically or based on actual data.  When the value of Bitcoin shoots up, people *do not* immediately assume that it will continue to shoot up forever, obviously.  They more often than not assume that it will, or may, go back down, and so they take the take the opportunity to spend their bitcoins as a form of *realizing* and cementing their profits.  Retailers have all reported massive influxes of sales when the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed in both April 2013, and November-December 2013.  
When my bitcoins double in value, I'm incredibly tempted to go buy that laptop I've always wanted now that I have some "free" money with which to do it, and there is a good chance that this opportunity may be short lived.  
Significant price rises have the same effect as advertisers who say "ACT WITHIN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES ONLY, AND YOU'LL GET ALL ITEMS AT 50% OFF!".  When there is massive uncertainty as there is with the price of Bitcoin, people jump on what they see as potentially fleeting opportunities.

Interesting. Game theory certainly indicates that free markets, when left to their own devices, are inherently unstable. They depend upon competition to function effectively, and market leaders are not only incentivized to diminish competition by means of monopolies, duopolies, or collusion with other market leaders, but they are also in a position of sufficient power to do so.
In this regard, the anarchists are definitely correct in my mind, but where I'm confused is the proposed solution to this problem, which requires a central authority with law enforcing power (government) to oversee the markets and ensure that this doesn't happen. This seems completely contrary to what my understanding of Anarchism is. Am I missing something?

Technically, all bitcoins are stored in the Blockchain.  What you control and store are simply the *keys* that give control to those coins.  
You could store these keys on paper if you want.  In fact, this is one of the safest ways to store Bitcoin (on paper, in a safe).  The downside is that you don't have instant access to your money, so I consider my offline bitcoins to be like a savings account, and my online bitcoins to be like my checking account, which I use to purchase goods and services from online retailers.  
Some websites actually store your bitcoin keys for you (like coinbase.com).   Others simply provide a convenient way to send and receive bitcoins from the web browser, and don't have any control over your coins at all (like blockchain.info).

It is likely that pools like P2P pool will become more popular once they have better user experiences, as they eliminate this problem by decentralizing the mining pools.
Furthermore, the number one thing preventing a 51% attack isn't the resource limitation, its the fact that it would be financial suicide to do it.  Anybody who has the capability to conduct a 51% attack is heavily invested in Bitcoin, and destroying your own wealth in an attempt to conduct a double-spend isn't something I'm concerned about people doing.  
Incentives, not resources, are the biggest defense against 51% attacks, which is why every time this happens, pool operators self regulate.

Most of what people consider to be "illogical" is actually just sound logic under a different set of equally valid premises.

Yes drugs are bad.  Some more than others, some legal ones more than illegal ones. You need to distinguish between something that is bad, and something that should be illegal.  America learned this the hard way during prohibition.  Alcohol is bad, why not make it illegal? Experience has taught us that outlawing something that is in high demand has consequences that are generally far worse than the thing you are trying to outlaw. When something that is in high demand is outlawed, the very first thing that happens is a black market is created.  The greater the demand, the more lucrative the black market.  Lucrative black markets quickly lead to organized crime, as there is a lot of money to be made.  Organized crime quickly leads to violence and corruption of public officials as they are enticed by greed, and bribed to look the other way, or eventually become part of the system.  This has been seen time and time again.  It is human nature. Drug use is actually lower in the Netherlands where it is legal than it is in the US.  Not only have we wasted billions and billions of dollars fighting an unwinnable war, but we have created a slew of cartels more powerful and better funded than the Mexican government.  That is why drugs are bad, but outlawing them is far worse

Actually, sha256 is better in the long run for decentralization, as unintuitive as it sounds. The reason being that there is no such thing as Asic proof. Asics will come out for script, and when they do, the proprietary nature of these custom designed chips will make it harder for chip makers to enter the space. Sha256 is so simple that there are open designs for asic production, and its very easy for new manufacturers to come aboard.

There is another part of the transaction that you are missing, which is that you must reference past transactions into your address which haven't been spent to demonstrate that you actually have the funds you are spending.  
If you spam out multiple transactions from the same account all trying to spend the same bitcoins but to different recipients (an attempted double spend attack), then the network will eventually (essentially randomly) choose one and come to a consensus across the entire network.  
This is the very problem that has prevented distributed currencies like bitcoin from existing in the past, which Satoshi solved.

Uh, not ludicrous.  Studying the effects and markets created by technology is far different from studying the technology itself.  Economists don't study state of the art computer science in their free time, nor do they study cryptography.  Sure, there are some that do, but most economists who predict Bitcoin is a bubble literally know almost nothing about what it is at its core.  All they see is a price chart, and think they understand Bitcoin because they understand supply and demand.  
They only study technology superficially.  Under your logic I guess im fully versed in quantum mechanics because I read a few books about it once.  Economists aren't super human renaissance men with in depth knowledge of every field.  They can't even agree amongst themselves, and they repeatedly fail miserably at doing the one thing they are supposed to be good at, which is managing economies.  
They can't even predict when economies are going to fail, so how the hell do you expect them to predict anything at all about Bitcoin?
The rise and ultimate success of Bitcoin will completely discredit all these so called "economists".  Mark my words.    Many of them have predicted Bitcoin will completely crash to zero this year, so it won't take long to discredit them.

It will make some people more wealthy, and others less wealthy.  Namely those who get their wealth by shaving off pieces of the billions of transactions that occur every day.


This is faulty logic.  The majority of the world in this scenario would be late adopters, and wouldn't see much, if any increase in their wealth holdings until demand increases due to population growth.  Especially considering that if everybody is moving to Bitcoin, then everybody who isn't moving to bitcoin is losing wealth as the value of whatever currency they have will be decreasing.

Yes, this is certainly a possibility, no doubt.  As is the possibility of an already existing unknown bug that permits nefarious activity.  Bitcoin isn't a perfect system by any means, but it is, thus far, a good enough system.  The dollar isn't perfect either, but its good enough.

I am fully aware of use value.  We have already established that air, sunlight and water all have high use value.  But air and sunlight have no exchange value because THEY ARE NOT SCARCE, and for no other reason.  It is scarcity that underlies the distinction here, demonstrating that use value and exchange value are one in the same, with scarcity being the only attribute that differentiates them.  What has use value or exchange value is dependent upon the circumstances.  
Anything that has a use value, but no exchange value would instantly gain an exchange value if it suddenly became scarce.  Tah duh,  I just demonstrated why your argument is bullshit.

There are different types of chaotic systems. Classical systems like the weather, or billiard balls, are chaotic because the outcome is hyper sensitive to the initial conditions. The chaos exists because of the impossible degree of precision that would be required to make an accurate prediction. 
Other systems, like the stock market for example, are Chaotic because there are no known rules that govern their behavior. Sure, one can make very short predictions using models, but long term predictions are impossible because there isn't enough information. You cannot simulate the outcome because the rules themselves are not fully known.
Bitcoin adoption is of the latter type, not the former.

False.  Economists don't know shit about peer to peer networks.  They don't know shit about open source software, or digital payment systems, or network protocols.  They don't know shit about coming to a consensus in a distributed system, and they don't know shit about cryptography.  You cannot understand Bitcoin *at all* unless you have a good grasp on all these concepts, and most economists don't.  Period.    
Exhibit A:


"The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'–which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants–becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."
*Economists do not understand technology*
Bitcoin doesn't fit into any of the models that economists have created.  It has never been done before, and nothing even close to it has ever existed in human history.  Economists have predicted that Bitcoin would fail several times already, and yet it keeps on defying them.

THIS DOES NOT INCREASE THE MONETARY SUPPLY.  Having a penny in the form of one million smaller units accomplishes nothing, as they are worthless, and it would have zero effect on prices or wealth.  Lets say the US replaces all pennies with one thousand milli-pennies.  Do prices go up or down?  No, they don't, because these milli-pennies are worthless and will not be used.  
So long as the units are granular enough for the smallest of transactions, it doesn't matter how much you divide the units up.  Furthermore, the day will never come where a satoshi isn't small enough, because the divisibility will be extended long before.

Oh no no no, there is a HUGE difference. You are failing to understand proof of work and the consensus model that Bitcoin is built on. 
Yes, Bitcoin *source code* is community sourced, but the network itself it built on proof of work consensus, and everything the network does must be within this scope. The Bitcoin network cannot refer to the Bitcoin source code, not even that can be trusted because there is no consensus behind it, and its external to the network.
That list can be easily manipulated or falsified, and there is no way to tell if it represents a broad consensus, therefore it cannot be trusted. Furthermore, its data that exists outside of the network, which could undermine this entire operation.

Scrypt ASICS will be far more exclusive.

I took a look at some of the network traffic in Wireshark, and it looks like OpenBazaar is making a connection to each node and asking for store data associated only with that node. Is this correct? If so, is there a reason why the nodes cannot simply return *all* (or some) of the store meta-data that node knows about? 
If I make a connection to a node asking it for store meta-data, seems like it ought to return to me the most recent list of all the other store nodes that it knows about, and this ought to take a fraction of a second round trip.

Apparently you weren't around in 1995 using the internet, because it was exactly the same way back then. It was inundated with scammers, thieves, and porn, and frankly, it still is.Liberating technologies are always adopted first by those who are on the edges of societal acceptance, but this doesn't mean these technologies should be abandoned. If used properly, including using third party escrow, Bitcoin is safer from abuse and fraud than the any other payment scheme.The current financial system is built on top of a pull, which requires the seller to have full access to the buyers account and funds, and then to hope that they don't abuse that power, or as is more common, they don't get hacked and end up letting somebody else abuse that power. This system was designed a long time ago, and its terrible.

Fact:  There has not been found any text online, known to have been written by Dorian, that demonstrates he is capable of writing in the way that Nakamoto has written.  Dorian's first language is not English.  He is not a native speaker.  Nakamoto was a native speaker.  
Fact:  The real Nakamoto has returned and stated "I am not Dorian"
Fact:  Dorian referred to Bitcoin as "Bitcom" on many occasions, and repeatedly assumed that it was a company
Fact:  Dorian's real name is Satoshi Nakamoto.  WELL I GUESS THAT IS CASE CLOSED FOR YOU.  You claim my evidence isn't strong, but you can't demonstrate *why*.  Furthermore, your only "evidence" is the fact that the two share a name.

There is nothing identical to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is more than just source code.  It's a network of people, infrastructure, miners, coders, merchants etc.  You can't copy that.  It has to be built.  
Anybody can create their own internet protocol too, and their own version of the web, does that hinder the internet in any way?  No, because despite the fact that barrier to entry is essentially zero for these things, and anybody can copy them and compete, competitors have to overcome the network effect of an already established standard, which is damn hard even if you have an objectively superior product, like IPv6 for example.

Why do cryptocurrencies need to be scarce?  The fact that anybody in the world can create a crypto-currency in about 5 minutes is no different than the fact that anybody in the world can also create their own internet protocol, and yet we don't see hardly anything but TCP/IP.  Even IPv6 which is "superior" is having immense difficulties gaining any traction at all after many years of release and implementation. 
Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that it is the de-facto standard of crypto-currencies.  It has the developers, it has the users, it has the media, it has the hardware, it has the miners, it has the merchants, and it has the overall infrastructure.  This is what gives Bitcoin its value, and this is what cannot be easily replicated by Bitcoin clones.

I'm fully aware of what is going on when a merchant accepts Bitcoin, as is everybody else on here, so you're not making some sort of great revelation. 
Furthermore, it doesn't matter if a merchant just dumps their Bitcoin on the market as soon as they get them, because Bitcoin is not *just* a currency. It's also a PAYMENT SYSTEM, and most merchants are using it as such. Does this represent some sort of failure for Bitcoin? No. Even if Bitcoin is only ever used as an intermediary transport system, then will be a huge success. 
The very fact that I can purchase Bitcoin, immediately send it to a merchant, which results in the Bitcoin immediately being sold, and do these steps all *cheaper*, *faster* and *safer* than alternatives is exactly why merchants are onboarding Bitcoin. 
So wake up *kid*, because Bitcoin has a bright future.

Dude, its only been a few months.  If you are expecting to get rich in a few months that is not investment, that is gambling.  Wait 3-5 years and re-asses your involvement at that time.  The thing you need to know about Bitcoin, is that it generally goes up in value in huge spurts.  You got in right after the last one, and you need to wait until the next one because prices generally don't go up much between spurts.  I got in after a spurt just like you (the last one in April), and just like you I was in the red for a bit until November.  But I waited it out.

You can't send a "fake" payment, no, because all payments are verified as authentic by nodes.  What you can try to do is send a double payment, where you send a valid payment to Zynga, and another valid payment back to yourself, hoping that the payment to yourself gets accepted by miners, and the payment to Zynga doesn't.  Note that these types of double-spend attempts can be easily detected, and there are even features going into Bitcoin so that nodes will relay these double spend attempts and broadcast them so that merchants and recipients can reject them before sending merchandise

Where power is given to individuals, they need to be held accountable.  I am not arguing in favor of no regulation where power imbalances exist.  I am simply saying that removing the ability to corrupt a system is preferable to attempting to regulate the behavior of free agents.  Where this can be done, do it, where it cannot be done, we have to rely upon external regulations like we do today.
Bitcoin isn't just a currency, or a payment system, or a commodity.  It is a *template* for removing power from a hierarchical system that can be applied to many of the systems society currently depends upon.  It allows us to replace the external regulations targeted at humans with internal regulations targeted at computers.  With this template, regulations are built into the very core of the system and require no human oversight or enforcement.

You apparently didn't read my entire comment.  It isn't a problem for merchants.  Bitpay and coinbase credit merchants accounts immediately without waiting for any confirmations.  Merchants take zero double spend risk.  The risk is taken on by Bitpay and Coinbase, and yes they do listen on the network for double spends.  Transactions are propagated throughout the network nodes very quickly, and double spend attempts are no different, making them quite easy to detect even if you are running only a few nodes.  Furthermore, as I said, this detection is currently being built into the bitcoin nodes themselves, so in the future, merchants won't have to rely up on third parties for protection like they do now.

The problem with getting smart about things like the inflation rate and such is that the algorithm would need input from sources external to the network. This creates points of manipulation because now there are people involved in some way shape or form, unless the external source is like bitcoin and autonomous. For example, something that seems so basic like the price of bitcoin is an external variable to the network, and if Bitcoin were to depend upon this external variable for something like the block reward algorithm, then Bitcoin would have a central point of failure in this external variable. Where would it get this variable from? Who would decide? This sort of thing introduces centralization and manipulation points.

The problem with this logic, is that it doesn't take into account the fact that people don't want to hold an asset that is depreciating in value, and will generally trade it for one that doesn't if they can.
People ridicule Bitcoin all the time because it incentivizes people to save it, which is true, but they fail to realize that when people have a *choice* in what currency to use, they inevitably end up *choosing* the one that doesn't punish them for doing so. 
Fiat currencies can get away with depreciating because the user usually has no alternative. Free market currencies have no such luxury, and people have yet to realize this fact. Currencies like Freicoin demonstrate this perfectly, and are doomed to fail when there are alternatives that don't punish you for using it.
**TLDR** Free market currencies cannot succeed as depreciating assets, as people will greedily *choose* a better asset. Fiat currencies don't have this problem due to monopoly status which prevents desertion.

The price goes up only 1% when TigerDirect starts accepting Bitcoin for the same reason Apple stocks have dropped several percent after the company announced record profits.  
What people need to understand about markets is that *market prices are not dependent upon good news or bad news.  They are dependent upon* **expectations**.  
Apple stocks fall despite record profits because even higher record profits were expected, and these *expected* higher profits were factored into the price before the announcement.  The record profits were *less than expected*, and thus the price of Apple stock fell.   
Likewise, the Bitcoin price doesn't move when TigerDirect announces that it is accepting Bitcoin because additional merchant adoption was already factored into the price, and it was expected.

This will enable people to use their Bitcoin to purchase a fully anonymous alt-coin from a distributed and untracable exchange.  Bitcoin may not be the currency of freedom and anonymity, but it will be the currency that allows anybody to buy that currency.  Bitcoin will be the currency of business and international finance, and the more it succeeds in that endeavor, the better it can be used as the gateway to anonymity.

The war on money laundering is just as successful as the war on drugs. Governments are learning through experience that the consequences of outlawing something in high demand are usually worse than the consequences of the thing they are outlawing.
Money laundering laws are similar in effect to Digital Rights Management restrictions. The outlaws have no problem going around them, and the lawful abiding citizens have to pay the cost of fines, fee's, restrictions, and overly complicated bureaucratic processes that clog the pipes of the economy.
The high demand of money laundering ecosystems creates a profit incentive for corrupted banks and insiders to cater to, and they do of course, because there's money to be made. The system ends up corrupted through and through, and when this is finally exposed for what it is.. the banks receive a slap on the wrist, nobody goes to jail, and nobody is even prosecuted (unless of course its a small time nobody like Charlie Schrem, then money laundering laws are strangely enforced with vigor). Money laundering laws, like drug laws, generally don't apply to those with money, power, or connections.
Please help me understand why money laundering laws are any better than drug laws. We'd be far better off focusing on the prosecution of those who actually commit the crimes in the first place, and making sure that the laws reflect the general attitude of the people. No law is better than a disregarded law. And

No, you are the typical Bitcoin user.  Bitcoin is more commodity than it is currency at the moment, and that is fine.  Bitcoin won't ever become a fully fledged currency until it can first prove itself as a commodity, and this will take a lot of infrastructure, and more importantly, time.  
Until then, Bitcoin will be used most frequently for gambling, illicit commerce, porn, remittances, micro-payment tips, and foreign transactions.  These are all areas where Bitcoin shines the most, despite its crazy fluctuations in value.

That's in the process of changing. 


That's because the system works very hard to prevent those who are profiled as risky from ever having credit cards in the first place. This prevents entire countries from having access to modern banking and credit cards. Would I accept a credit card payment from a Nigerian Prince? Hell no. The possibility of fraud is simply too high. Would I accept a Bitcoin payment? Absolutely. Bitcoin requires absolutely no vetting or verification because trust is not required. I would even BUY a product from my Nigerian prince friend using multisig escrow. It's a better system, period. It will take a while for its promises to be realized, but they will, eventually. Whether it be Bitcoin or Bitcoin 2.0 or some alt-coin, crypto-currencies or something like it *will* replace the vast majority of our current financial system.

You'll lose all your money doing it, unless the exchange doesn't have any trading fee's.  Furthermore, trading back and forth doesn't theoretically alter the price, as the net effect from buying and then selling is zero.  All that happens is you are donating some of your money to the exchanges, and increasing the volume slightly.
BTC exchanges are not regulated however, so we can assume that somebody is taking advantage of that fact, most likely the exchange owners themselves.  Though, regulation doesn't fix these issues.  Look at Libor and HSBC, both "regulated".  You can't regulate away corruption.

Governments print money because its easier than raising taxes, and then they proceed to give the majority of the newly printed money to those who are already at the top of the pyramid.

Sorry dude, but the reality of the matter is that 99.9% of people are not capable of securely storing their own money. The important issues in this situation are the following:
1) People have the *option* of storing their own money if they so choose. This puts pressure on third parties to provide a service that is actually worth the risk of having somebody else store your money.
2) There is enough competition among those who offer to secure your money that they are aggressive in their fight to obtain and hold new customers.

Nope, because there is no version of Bitcoin that can be forced upon the miners and node operators.  The core devs could check in a bad change for sure, but nobody would upgrade their software to use that version, they would simply continue running the old version and ignore the change.   Bitcoin is nothing more than a protocol, and protocols cannot be changed unless the majority who use the protocol agree upon that change.

Ugh I hate it when people say "When somebody boys somebody else sells"This is completely misleading and idiotic. A buy occurs when a buyer goes over to the sellers and purchases from the lowest asker at the market rate. A sell occurs when a seller goes over to the buyers and sells at the highest market bid rate.Buys and sells are determined by who initiated the transaction and paid a premium equal to the market spread in order to do so. And in this definition, price goes up when there are buys, and down when there are sells.

If you look back at many of the biggest price crashes that occurred in Bitcoin, you'll find MtGox was associated in some way or other.  So, yes this is a good thing for Bitcoin in the long run, but don't at all take it to mean that Bitcoin will stabalize.  Bitcoin is entering its Stable period, and if the past is any indication of the future (which it usually isn't, but Bitcoin seems to be following a repeating pattern to the T) then Bitcoin will be relatively stable for a few months until it shoots up in price, crashes, and this starts all over again.

A 2 of 2 transaction offers no protection against fraud. What you want is a 2 of 3 transaction with a neutral third party acting as an escrow. I've never used any bitcoin escrow services, but they do exist.

blockchain.info is pretty safe if you use it properly.  First, and most importantly, make sure that you have two factor authentication enabled.
log-in -&gt; account settings -&gt; security -&gt; two factor authentication
Choose SMS, or google authenticator, or something tied to your phone instead of email for the best security.  This means that if your computer is compromised by a key-logger virus, that somebody cannot take all your bitcoins because they'd have to get access to your phone as well.  
The cool thing about blockchain.info is that they never have possession of your private keys, as they are generated in your browser from your password, and never transmitted.  So nobody at the website can access your coins either, which is important.  And if the site goes down or something, then you can still access them by importing the private keys into a different wallet.
If you are using two factor authentication, then blockchain.info is pretty safe.  Its a good tradeoff between convenience and security.  If you are looking for the best security, a paper wallet in a safe is about as good as it gets!  Hacking isn't possible, and you can keep multiple copies of them in safe places.  It's just more of a hassle when you want to spend them.

If you think bitcoin will prevent governments from waging wars than you're an idiot. The last 50 years have been seen the fewest wars the world has ever seen by significant margins. The farther back you go in time, the more wars and violence you find. You can go back to the days when Gold was the de-facto currency in Europe, and you still find far far more wars than are fought today. **You're argument completely ignores the last six thousand years of world history.**
There *will* be fewer wars in the future, but it won't be because of lack of funding or because Bitcoin takes over the world. It will be because the world is more connected economically, politically, socially and technologically than it ever has been before.

All changes to Bitcoin can be easily done.  What is hard, is getting people to accept your changes.  If greater divisibility were required, it would be quickly adopted by nearly all miners and nodes, as there is no downside to implementing that change, and it would provide many benefits.  Changing the number of coins would also be easy, but getting miners and nodes to adopt that change would not be easy, as inflating the currency would decrease the value of everybody's bitcoins, and convincing people to adopt such a change would be challenging to say the least.

The core devs have power to suggest and implement ideas and improvements, but they do not have the ability to force those changes on the community anymore than they can force you to use a particular web browser.  At the end of the day, the community accepts or rejects any proposed changes, so if the devs do something obviously stupid, then nobody accepts those changes and life moves on.  Remember, bitcoin is a protocol, like email. If some group of developers out there decided to change the SMTP email protocol, it wouldn't matter, because everybody would continue on using the current version. Change can only happen by consensus of the community, and that happens when people choose which version of the protocol to run. People will generally choose the version that is in their best interest to run

I don't usually transfer funds either, but my parents were recently in a financial crisis, and I had to send them $2,500 ASAP. I had to RUSH to a nearby Chase bank before they closed, so I could get money into their account by the next day. It was a Friday, and the money arrived sometime on Saturday. But if I had sent the money on Saturday, it wouldn't have arrived until Tuesday. Furthermore, I had to PHYSICALLY go bank, write a check, and then deposit it into my parents account. It was ridiculous. Most people don't realize how terrible the current system is until they actually use it. 
Why the hell don't banks work around the clock? Are they aware that we have these modern marvels of technology called "computers" that are capable of working off hours? I should be able to send money the same way I send an email, and that is why Bitcoin matters. I can imagine many people wondered why e-mail mattered because the post office always worked fine for them.

In reality, it's quite simple. Value is a creation of the human mind, and comes about via consensus among individuals, groups, or societies. That is all there is to it. Value is simply agreement, and there need not be a logical reason for that agreement. Humans are fickle and irrational, and if a group of them come together and agree that [can's of fish are currency]( then can's of fish are currency.
The regression theorem is a theory. Bitcoin is an experiment. Experiments are reality, and theories simply attempt to explain what is seen experimentally. If one says that Bitcoin has no value because of the regression theorem, then they've got it backwards. If Bitcoin has value (which it does), then the regression theorem is wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:46:33
If it can be both, that would be great, but as Andreas Antonopolous has said, Bitcoin will need fundamental changes at the transaction layer in order to have anonymity built in, and unless these changes happen soon before Bitcoin explodes, it will be too late to get them in.  Furthermore, Bitcoin is being more and more used by people who don't care as much about anonymity as they do about many of the other issues with Bitcoin, so not only is this is a time sensitive issue  for practical reasons, its also time sensitive because the desire to implement it is decreasing as it goes more mainstream.  My point here isn't to make predictions, but to say that ultimately it doesn't really matter if Bitcoin is anonymous or not, because it will enable anonymous financial transactions via other coins.

They are selling them immediately, and frankly you can't expect companies with razor thin margins to do anything else.  This isn't a bad thing though, as it increases the liquidity and utility of Bitcoin, and as more and more merchants and distributors start accepting Bitcoin as payment, then it becomes more and more tempting to remain within the Bitcoin ecosystem as suddenly the guy you need to pay for goods and services also accepts Bitcoin, so why bother exchanging out and losing 1%?  I am suspecting that it will take at least a few years for this kind of ecosystem to spring up, but I see it as inevitable eventually.

All credit card transactions cost Merchants 2-3% of the total plus a swipe fee. 
Customers pay the cost of this by merchants increasing their prices to pay for it. So yes, you are paying for this as a customer. This is why many merchants are offering discounts to those who pay with Bitcoin. 
Furthermore, even though the money shows up in the merchants account almost immediately, it doesn't *clear* for days, weeks, or even months. The transaction can be, and frequently is, reversed, which merchants have to pay for.

My argument has nothing to do with the fact that I'm a developer.  I mentioned that fact as a direct response to your suggestion that I didn't understand "how development projects work", and thus the statement was quite relevant.
You have failed to respond to the core of my argument, which is that there is no central "official" version of Bitcoin running on some server somewhere.  The software is distributed.  Miners and node operators run whatever version they think is best, and they will not upgrade to a version that benefits them less than the current version.  
Bitcoin is fundamentally nothing but a protocol, and distributed protocols don't change simply because some guy updated a binary.  Those changes have to be adopted by the network voluntarily.  This is why the internet is still using IPv4 almost exclusively despite IPv6 being available, pushed and promoted for many years now.  People simply prefer IPv4 in most circumstances, and so they use it.

You're missing the point.  Fine, I'll compare penny stocks with the commodities market like Gold and Silver, and my logic is sound.  You're changing the subject here, and not addressing the fault in your logic which is that high risk/high reward investments are not a threat to more stable investments simply because more money can be made with them.  Which, by the way isn't even true, as alt-coins don't have enough liquidity to make sizable amounts of money.  Name one alt-coin that wouldn't jump by an absurd amount at 1 million dollar purchase, or drop at the sale.  There isn't one.  


Are you seriously questioning that claim? All alt-coins have miniscule amounts of liquidity compared to Bitcoin, which also has little liquidity when compared to mature financial markets.  Yes, I can absolutely back up this claim with data, but I'm not about to spend the time to do so, as this is common knowledge.
Can you back up the claim that Bitcoin price will plummet when people "realize" that altcoins are the way to go?  I want a 10 page report with peer reviewed sources.  Oh, you can't? well I guess I win.

The answer is simply that this news was already factored into the price.  Tiger direct had been hinting at this for a while now.  Basically, the price went from ~130 to ~1200 under the expectation that a lot of merchants would start adopting Bitcoin.  That expectation is simply becoming fulfilled, so in a sense *reality is catching up with the price*.  
 Furthermore, Bitcoin just had a massive run up in price, and the markets are still recovering from that.  Also, there is downward pressure on the price right now, as we're still languishing in the high of the dead cat bounce.  I expect prices to slowly drop to 750 or so and level out in the high 700's.

Bitcoin is NOT A CURRENCY.  It is a commodity that can be spent like a currency.  Bitcoin is designed to be as close to digital gold as is currently possible.  Do people hoard Gold?  Yes.  Has Gold lost its legitimacy because it is hoarded?  No.  Would Gold have significantly more utility if you could transfer it to anybody in the world nearly instantly with almost no fee's?  YES.  
Hoarding is not bad for Bitcoin, and if you think that people being greedy is going to damage Bitcoin then Bitcoin isn't what you think it is.

The war on money laundering is just as successful as the war on drugs. Governments are learning through experience that the consequences of outlawing something in high demand are usually worse than the consequences of the thing they are outlawing. (see The Prohibition) 
Money laundering laws are similar in effect to Digital Rights Management restrictions. The outlaws have no problem going around them, and the lawful abiding citizens have to pay the cost of fines, fee's, restrictions, and overly complicated bureaucratic processes that clog the pipes of the economy. 
The high demand of money laundering ecosystems creates a profit incentive for corrupted banks and insiders to cater to, and they do of course, because there's money to be made. The system ends up corrupted through and through, and when this is finally exposed for what it is.. the banks receive a slap on the wrist, nobody goes to jail, and nobody is even prosecuted. Money laundering laws, like drug laws, generally don't apply to those with money, power, or connections. 
Please help me understand why money laundering laws are any better than drug laws. We'd be far better off focusing on the prosecution of those who actually commit the crimes in the first place, and making sure that the laws reflect the general attitude of the people. No law is better than a disregarded law.

It's the same in all systems of money. Dollars, Euros, Yen etc. The numbers simply represent a fraction of the total supply. Money is at its core nothing but a point system, or a ledger. That is all it has ever been, but few people actually stop to think about this and make such a realization. 
People don't make Bitcoin perse, they earn it by working for it. People want Bitcoin for different reasons. 
Some like the fact that Bitcoin is the only way to send money around the world without going through a trusted third party. I can send you money directly, from me to you, without having to deal with a bank, or payment processor. You don't need to open an account, or get verified. Bitcoin is open for everybody to use, like the internet. Because there are no middle men in Bitcoin, the cost of sending transactions is miniscule. Right now around 4 cents to send any amount of money to anybody, anywhere in the world. Also, when properly secured, Bitcoin cannot be frozen by governments. Payments cannot be stopped, and there is no personal information associated with transactions. I don't need to know anything about you, and you don't need to know anything about me for us to transact (apart from the destination address). It is a trustless system. Would you accept a credit card payment at your online store from a Nigerian prince? Hell no. Would you accept a Bitcoin payment from a Nigerian prince? Absolutely. Payments cannot be reversed. When you see it in your account it is yours. Period. You now own it and control it. Bitcoin cannot be fabricated or counterfeited. People also like that the creation of Bitcoin is open, predictable, and 100% transparent. It is controlled by an algorithm, and 25 Bitcoins are created approximately every 10 minutes. This will halve to 12.5 Bitcoins per 10 minutes sometime in 2016, and then halve again in 2020, and so on every four years until all 21 million bitcoins have been created, and that will be the end of its creation. The capped supply gives people assurances that their money will not be artificially de-valued by supply inflation. A common problem with fiat currencies.

Its quite simple really, since Bitcoin has a limited supply, if demand increases, so will its price.  So your question is the same as asking if demand for Bitcoin will continue to increase as it has, which of course nobody knows, but Bitcoin is showing absolutely no signs of slowing down adoption, especially considering all the new businesses, exchanges, developers, and users that are jumping on board every day.  This trend is no where near its peak demand I believe, but this is all speculation.


Bitcoin has already had 4 major devaluations, look at the *log based* price charts for Bitcoin since its inception, and you'll quickly see the pattern.  Bitcoin is devalued when there is bad news, and increases in value when there is good news, its as simple as that.  Always has been.  Bitcoin is not going to disappear anymore than the Pythagorean theorem can disappear.  It can't be uninvented.  It's nothing more than a protocol.  Could it be suddenly devalued more than it is today?  Sure, if there is substantial bad news.  But likewise, if there is substantial good news, you'll see another massive surge in price.  
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:42:32


Totally agree with you here Darkwings, this bothers me as much as it bothers you.  I didn't buy bitcoin to get rich, and I *never* tell anybody to put any money into bitcoin they aren't completely willing to lose, because that is a possibility that can certainly happen.  
I bought bitcoin because I like what it represents, and what it stands for: *The decentralization of the power to control the money supply and transactions.*  This is the real potential value of Bitcoin, not its price.  
There is no doubt that Bitcoin has become something of a religious cult, inundated with overzealous aficionados, but this has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself, nor is it any fault of the Bitcoin protocol.  This is the result of thousands of years of pent up demand for a financial system that isn't abused by the corrupt and powerful to further their agendas at the expense of the poor and weak.  While I do believe that this behavior is harmful to Bitcoin, I don't believe it will result in its demise or its undoing.


Yes, this is how all money works... When my 401k goes up in value, where does that money come from?  When the value of my house goes up in value, where does that come from?  All money is a zero sum game with respect to wealth.  This is basic free markets and capitalism in action here.  


Bitcoin is nothing more than a protocol, and ultimately a protocol is deemed successful by only a single metric:  Is it used or not, and if it is, how much is it used.  Bitcoin *could* be a failure in the end, but so far it is objectively a resounding success according to the metric to which all protocols are judged, and is only showing signs of greater adoption and improved infrastructure.

Think of Bitcoin like Gold, not like a fiat currency.  Does the limited supply of Gold make it unable to succeed?  No, of course not, in fact, that is biggest reason people invest in it, because they know that the supply is relatively stable.
It is like a commodity that you can spend, and send anywhere in the world.  Yes, if the demand decreases so does its price.

Multi-sig is not at all the same as a chargeback, and it is far superior. The difference is that in a chargeback, the money is *returned* to the buyer. In a multisig, the transaction never actually completes until (buyer + arbiter) or (seller + arbiter) agree. What this means, is that no third party actually holds your money in arbitration with multisig. The arbiter can only approve the transaction, they can't freeze your funds or do any of the many shady things that third parties can do because they don't have it. All they have is the authority to accept or reject the transaction that you initiated. Furthermore, arbiters can do this in a completely automated fashion with pretty much no cost until there is a dispute, at which point they manually intervene.

Well, in a sense your friend is correct.  We need to have oversight of these people because they possess great power, and if we do not check that power, it gets abused.  Bitcoin takes the power away from them, and replaces them with an open and verifiable algorithm.  External regulation is not needed if the ability to corrupt the system is removed entirely.  Bitcoin is regulated internally by mathematics, cryptography, and algorithms, and in this sense, it is a form of regulation far more effective, efficient, and trustworthy than any human is capable of.
@_date: 2014-09-23 04:07:48
Merchants accepting bitcoin is not an absurdity just because they dump the coins. It just means that they prefer to use Bitcoin as a transport mechanism which is a perfectly valid use case. 
Bitcoin is so efficient, that I can buy it, immediately send it to a merchant, they sell it, and despite all of these ridiculous steps it can STILL be done quicker, cheaper, and safer than any other alternative in the world. 
Most merchants won't start keeping bitcoin until the price stabilizes (if that ever happens), or until some or most of their suppliers also accept it, in which case they can simply pass it on down the chain.

The reason it is hard, is because bitcoin is a non-refundable product, and *most* transactions that people are familiar with these days are *reversible*.  Meaning that if I buy Bitcoins from you via paypal or something convenient like that, I wait until I get my bitcoins, then I issue a charge-back and contest the transaction in an attempt to get it reversed, which will likely occur because most of the time, virtual goods like Bitcoin are not covered.  If I'm good, I can get the transaction reversed, get my money back, but you cannot get your BTC back.

That is *one* of the purposes of Bitcoin, and the entire purpose of DRM. DRM is a subset of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is superset of DRM. 
Bitcoin does *a lot* more than just ensure copy protection over digital assets. That technology has been available for *long* time via basic public/private key systems. If that was all there were to Bitcoin, then there wouldn't be anything remarkable about it. 
The ability to *transfer* that protected ownership *without a trusted third party* is the core feature of Bitcoin. The only feature that is noteworthy, frankly. DRM doesn't solve the Byzantine Generals Problem. Bitcoin does. This feature not something you just dismiss. It's the foundation of the entire system.

Ugh I can't stand all these "so and so could be the creator of Bitcoin!" claims when nearly every one of these individuals had absolutely no expertise in cryptography/programming.

Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were some of the only people actually interested in creating such a thing, which isn't to say that they did it, but to say that few people in the world even thought it would be a *good idea*, let alone had the expertise to pull it off.

No. The point of DRM technology is to ensure that *ownership remains in control of the content creator*. That's it.  
The point of Bitcoin technology is to allow individuals to *transfer ownership* without a trusted third party intermediary.

Control is stopping the government from doing this.  Bitcoin cannot be controlled even by its creator because it exists on a platform that is the most incorruptible and uncontrollable device that scales ever devised by man.  Thus, the USG could create an uncontrollable Bitcoin clone, but what benefits would it offer over Bitcoin?  None, and Bitcoin already has a huge headstart, and a global following who will be rightly skeptical to follow anything the USG is pushing.  
The USG could create a digital currency that it controls, sure, and it would have some superior properties to dollars sure, but it wouldn't be Bitcoin.  It wouldn't be global and ignore borders, it wouldn't be incorruptible, it wouldn't be uncontrollable, it would require trust, it wouldn't allow un-freezable accounts, and unstoppable transactions, and it would have the overall taint of the USG on it, making it undesirable everywhere but the US, and even in the US many wouldn't want it.
Bitcoin is the money of the people, no government necessary.  Governments are not going to give up their power over the monetary system unless they absolutely have to.

No, because value in the general sense is a general agreement among members of society.  The fact that I traded $1000 for a free program that anybody can get without trading anything at all does not imply that the Firefox open source software has value.
The fact that a person acts irrationally and trades something of value for something that can be obtained at no cost whatsoever does not imply general value, it implies value to that individual only.

Bitcoin has a small chance of becoming a major currency if it is flawed. The most probably scenario is that if Bitcoin has major flaws, it is replaced by something very similar to it that doesn't. Bitcoin itself really doesn't matter in the long run, as the idea that it represents will go forward regardless of how successful Bitcoin is.
Inventing Bitcoin for nefarious purposes would be like a dictator inventing democracy so that he could take over congress and finally do his own bidding without the consent of the people, even though he already had that power as a dictator (see the irony?). 
The probability of this plan succeeding is quite low. The probability of this plan backfiring if it does succeed is quite high, as a valid democracy might just catch on, and the probability that a dictator would actually invent something so contrary to his core beliefs is quite low.

Everytime people say this, I always point out that Satoshi created Bitcoin on Windows using Visual Studio. If you want quick adoption of your software, then you need to write it on a platform that most people have access to, and that is exactly what Satoshi did.

This is possibly the worst article on this subject that I have ever read.

Yes, they have, and this has been the result:
Why trust them when you don't have to?  The only reason people have put their trust in centralized authority is because there was no other option, until now.  You honestly think the masses will chose corrupt and corruptible politicians over a distributed non-owned non-corruptible system?  The internet itself is a great example of what can happen when centralized authority based on trust is replaced with distributed trust-less authority.

You should be aware that services like Dropbox and this one you are trying out do not protect your data. The corporation has access to it, and therefore the government also has access to it, and any hackers who manage to compromise the system also have access to it.
If you want to have secure data, then you need to have control over the encryption keys that protect your data. 
There are cloud services that do this, and SpiderOak is one of them. I've been trying it out recently and its not bad. Mega.co.nz also lets you control your own keys. If you want to have a secure data backup solution, then you'll want to ensure that you and only you have access to your data.

Well, it essentially just means that there will always be *some* demand for dollars because the government  is forcing everybody to use it.  People act like this is some great feature, being forced to use a currency.  Bitcoin is used voluntarily because people prefer it, not because they are forced to use it.  People *like* to use it.
Furthermore, Bitcoin is only getting better as time goes on, as more people enter the network, and more features and infrastructure are built.  
Basically what people are saying is that the dollar is so crappy that the government has to force people to use it less they use something else.  Yeah, great argument.

Frankly, I actually think this is a good thing for Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general.

The fact that you actually think you are getting cash back is hilarious and sad. The prices of everything you buy are increased by merchants to compensate for the fees they must pay.

First, if you manage to solve a block, you earn 25 Bitcoins, not 50.  It was 50 bitcoins per block for the first 4 years, and it halves every four years.  In 2017 it will be 12.5 Bitcoins per block.
Second, you will **not** solve a block with your computer, period.  Isn't going to happen.  If you want to mine Bitcoins, you will need to buy expensive *Dedicated* hardware that is designed specifically for mining Bitcoins and doing nothing else.  Chances are you will pay more for the hardware than you will make from mining Bitcoins and paying your electricity bill, so no, its not free money at all.
How hard is Bitcoin mining?  It is as hard as it needs to be such that the entire Bitcoin network working together will take about 10 minutes to solve each block.  It is always about *10 minutes hard* for the entire network.  So, when a bunch of new miners jump on board and start mining, the problem automatically makes itself harder to account for the new addition of computing power.

If Bitcoin fails, it will be replaced by Bitcoin 2.0, and if that fails, then Bitcoin 3.0.  There is no end to this phenomena.

It's quite simple really...food only has value because there is a finite supply, like everything else.  
Consider the invention of a star trek replicator that instantly created any food you wanted.  Such a device would literally result in food having zero value, as would water, or anything else that can be easily replicated simply because anybody could get as much of it as they wanted.  How much would somebody give me for some food?  Nothing, because they could create their own for free.  
Are you really claiming that in a world with infinite supply of any product, that that product would have value?  Really?  Perhaps you also believe that the characters on your screen have value.
If you fail to understand that scarcity is what underlies all value, *in accordance with agreement*, well then its your IQ that is in short supply here.  
You are correct in that scarcity doesn't guarantee value, but *the lack of it guarantee's no value*.  Thus it can be proven that nothing has intrinsic value unless it has some scarcity to it, which is what Andreas was claiming, and its 100% correct.

There is no *allow* or *disallow* 
The same thing can be said of the internet:
So the internet will allow for illegal goods like Child porn, explosives, weapons, terrorism etc? Yes, the internet does allow those things because the internet just deals with 1's and 0's. It doesn't discriminate, and the internet wouldn't be as powerful of a tool if it did. 
It is not possible to prevent every crime, and attempting to do so is detrimental because you inevitably end up with burdensome restrictions that deter legitimate users, which are simply circumvented by those who are determined to do otherwise anyway. So what has been gained? 
The media companies are slowly learning this lesson. All the restrictions placed upon media in an attempt to prevent piracy simply punishes legitimate users, as pirates simply circumvent them. Piracy continues unabated, and legitimate users suffer. What has been gained?

I find all these debates about why bitcoin has value to be humorous. Humans are fickle irrational creatures, and we can put value on whatever the hell we damn well feel like without regard to any theorem. Having said that, Bitcoin has value to different people for different reasons. Some hate the banking system, some hate government control, some want micro payments, some want international payments, some fear inflation, some hope for appreciation, some want personal privacy, some want to buy or sell illicit goods, some merchants want to bypass credit card fees, some want to gamble, some are interested in the technology, some don't want middle men, some don't want chargebacks, etc etc

No.. what makes you think that? The user adoption rate is higher now than it ever has been (with the exception of the brief bubble periods). The price of Bitcoin is based almost entirely on speculation, and is the result of a very few number of individuals with a very large amount of money/bitcoin. 
Just a few days ago, *one* individual was responsible for the drop in price from $400 to less than $300. Likewise, very few individuals can be responsible for the rise in price.

Actually, only a small fraction of the dollars that exist were printed in the way you describe.. The vast majority of dollars that exist were created through the fractional reserve lending system. Banks create money out of thin air when they make a loan. 95% of all dollars that exist have no paper backing. They are simply entries in bank databases... They are simply digital points.

Lol no. That has nothing at all to do with it. 
No, you have it wrong. Adoption is increasing, significantly, and you're confusing adoption with the price, which is all based on speculation. Miner pressure cannot push the price down indefinitely, it will find a sweet spot where the supply is balanced by the demand, that's what markets do. Seems like you are just upset that you bought above where that sweet spot is, and now you're bitter about it.

You can't just burn Bitcoin and expect customers to flock to you. It depends on how much you have burned **relative to other merchants**, in conjuction with customer review feedback. Customers will flock toward merchants who have burned the most, as they will trust these merchants. 
Furthermore, a merchant will be *continually adding to their burn pool* over time, scammers will be starting over from 0 for each new account. 
You can never win a distance race where you continually start over after the first mile, even if you are sprinting. The slow walker will have walked hundreds of miles at a steady pace in a year, and double that in two years. If you're competing for distance, then continually starting over basically eliminates you from the race.
Also, wise customers will never purchase from a seller who has burned less than the item to be purchased. If I'm buying a $50 item, then I'm not going to trust a seller who has burned less than that, or even a number less than double or triple that.
Finally, the fact that scammers will actually have to put some money in the game BEFORE they do any scamming will be a major detractor. The scammer commits money, and now his scam has to succeed or he's in the hole. That's a risk many scammers aren't going to take.

People run whatever version of Bitcoin they want, and no changes can be forced upon them.  If I submit a change to Bitcoin, and I can convince the network to accept it, it will be accepted.  Simple as that.

Really?  I own a house, after saving up for it while living in an apartment.  I also have two young children, and managed to save enough to do a 20% down payment on my mortgage.  


Yes, there is a reason why we have banks, but that reason is not so that we can live beyond our means by incurring debt that we are not capable of repaying.  If you are unable to save any money, then you're going to get hosed on your mortgage rate, and you'll be better off just renting.  You are not entitled to own a house.

The reason this happens so much with credit cards is because every single transaction reveals your private keys to the other party, and you have to trust every person you transact with not to abuse their access to your funds, and to keep them safe from criminals.It should come as no surprise that criminals frequently break into merchant databases, accessing customer information and credit card numbers. The security model of this system revolves around mitigation after fraud has occurred, not preventing fraud in the first place. Just stop and think about the fact that you authenticate a credit card transaction by a physical signature by hand.. That's the level of technology we are dealing with here.

Seriously?  I've posted the definition of value according to wikipedia like three times already in our conversation:  This is the definition of value:


If something is *generally* traded among society then its value can be computed relative to the value of the things that are traded for it.  If society is not willing to trade anything for that item because it is free and readily accessible, then it has no economic value. 
Scarcity is fundamental to value, basic economics.  Your feeble brain isn't able to grasp this idea.

So its boolean then?  Valuable or not valuable?  But are some things more valuable than others?  If you think so, then they must be quantified via some number or metric.  You said it yourself, that markets are trying to *estimate* value with price.  So once again you are contradicting yourself.  
**This is the definition of value according to wikipedia:** 


Value is quantifiable, saying otherwise is contrary to basic economics, and contrary to your very own statements about markets.  If it isn't quantifiable, then its useless and serves no purpose to any conversation or economics as a whole because it cannot be modeled.


Yes, of course, but the inverse is not true.  There are no objects that are not scarce, that are valuable.  That is my entire point.  Scarcity is essential to value.

No, fee's will go down significantly from what they are now.  Yes, they might go up from a half cent to three quarters of a cent under some circumstances, but compared to what they are now, they will be significantly lower.  Your entire premise here is incorrect.  The only reason the fee's are so high right now is because the default fee is hardcoded into the code, and since Bitcoin knows nothing about exchange rates, fee's are denominated in Bitcoins, so when the price shot up in Nov, the default fee suddenly became quite large.  Floating fee's will solve this problem so that when the price skyrockets, the fee's go down.  This is a much needed and very important feature.

Several reasons. 
1) Ebay charges rediculous fee's. OpenBazaar merchants could burn a quarter of the price they'd pay to E-bay and paypal in fee's and gain significant reputation points, while still earning more than they would on E-bay.
2) Ebay doesn't allow you to sell a lot of things, like illicit drugs for example


Because you cannot fake burned coins. Either you burned them or you didn't. A merchant can burn $1000 in a year by shaving small fractions off his sales and burning them. In two years, he can have $2000, or significantly more. In three years $3000. The merchant is burning a small amount, but over time it ads up very quickly. A scammer cannot do this, they will have to burn $1000 right now with a new account, try to get their review positive review count up, and then scam people, resulting in a complete loss of their burned coins. So they'll have to start over again, burning another $1000, but by this time, legitimate merchants now have $2000 burned, so the scammer now has to invest significantly more. 


No, you have demonstrated absolutely no logic. Proof of Burn has been validated by game theory for a long time now. It's not new, and if you knew anything about game theory you'd know that. 
TLDR you don't know what you're talking about.

Who would be feeling this "pressure" to produce more?  Nobody is in control of Bitcoin.  Owners of Bitcoin don't want more of it to be produced because that will deflate the value of their Bitcoins, and last time I checked people were not interested in losing money.  So the truth of the matter is that there is pressure to maintain the fixed supply.  Besides, nobody is in charge of Bitcoin, nobody can suddenly decide to produce more of it.  In order for that to happen, the majority of network nodes and miners would have to agree to such a change, which would be against their best interests.  


[Abandoning Gold wasn't all flowers and roses](
When the supply of the money is in control of a few people, you have given them power to extract wealth as they please from anybody via targeted inflation.  Goverments use the printing of money as a form of taxation that requires no approval.  Sure, in theory a government could manage the money supply quite well to the benefit of the people, but this is rarely the case.  
You probably happen to live in the US, which, for now, enjoys the luxury of having the worlds reserve currency, making it quite stable.  Your opinion of fiat currencies would likely be different if you had lived in one of the many countries that suffered from hyperinflation like I have.  The power to control the supply of the currency has historically been poorly managed, and will continue to be.  
Besides, *Bitcoin wasn't designed to replace fiat currencies*, it is merely an alternative.  It was designed as a system for trustless exchange of wealth over the internet, and to enable global micro transactions which are currently not possible with any other technology.  This is all Bitcoin has to do in order to be successful.  
Furthermore, Bitcoin is completely optional.  Nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin like people were forced to use gold based currencies.  When its use is completely optional, and people have access to legitimate alternatives (fiat), then Bitcoin is forced to stand on its own merit.  It wasn't designed to be a currency, its a commodity, like Gold, which has the benefit of being transferable to anybody in the world, at almost no cost, at any time, without the possibility of the transaction being denied, and without the possibility of the transaction being reversed.  There is no other technology like this in the world.

In the end it won't really matter.  Bitcoin could be co-opted by big government and corporations, but that won't stop this revolution in the slightest, as there is one feature of Bitcoin that will ensure that the ideals that Bitcoin stands for continue on:  The fact that bitcon payments cannot be stopped, and addresses cannot be frozen.  This means that if the day comes when Bitcoin is co-opted by regulators and corporations, then Bitcoin can still be used to easily and seamlessly purchase an anonymous and unregulated alt-coin, and this cannot be stopped or prevented. Bitcoin simply becomes the gateway to freedom, instead of freedom in and of itself.  Either way, freedom will be available.

Each bitcoin represents a fixed share of the Bitcoin economy.  If the economy goes up, then all members of the economy gain according to their shares, just like a stock.  Increasing the size of the pie does not change the sizes of slices relative to each other.  Everybody increases their wealth in a fair way.
I find it amusing that you are concerned about money moving from the top down in Bitcoin when wealth in the current system is moving from the bottom to the top, and has been for decades, *and the very reason that it has been is because the wealthy get most of the newly created money*, which is not possible in Bitcoin.
A wealthy person with lots of Bitcoin cannot get more Bitcoin by just doing nothing and sitting on them.  They have a fixed share of the economy, and if they do nothing, then that share remains at its fixed size.  Contrast this to the current system, where the wealthy can literally increase the share of their wealth in the economy by just sitting on it, as the majority of the newly created money goes straight to the top.  
I'd rather be wealthy in the current system, than be wealthy in a Bitcoin like system because the current system is rigged in favor of those who have money (unsurprisingly).  Deflation will not continue forever for the same reason gold prices have not continued to rise forever.  A fixed supply does not guarantee forever increasing prices.  Bitcoin prices will level out eventually when its fate has been determined and there isn't so much uncertainty.  At that point, Bitcoin will become be a hedge against inflation like Gold, but not a great investment.

You've missed my point entirely.  The Bitcoin network is indeed using a lot of computing power, but it is a very specific kind of computing power not comparable to the computing power that your computer uses.  
Our laptops and desktops can compute anything, they are general purpose computers, but because they are so general purpose, they are not that good at doing specific things.  The Bitcoin network is the opposite.  It can only really do one thing, which is compute double SHA256 hashes, and because it is designed to do a single thing, it does it very well.  This means the bitcoin network is significantly better than anything else in the world at computing SHA256, but it is completely worthless for any other purpose.  This is why you can't fairly compare it to the worlds super computers, which can compute anything.

Bitcoin has never been a currency.  It has always been a digital commodity, a payment system, a protocol, and a globally distributed asset ledger.  It was never a currency, but it might become one some day in the future if it can prove itself as a reliable store of value as a commodity, but that will require time.

You're missing the entire point dude. I don't have to transfer my Bitcoins anywhere to "get them out of the country". They were never in any country in the first place. They have always existed "outside the country". That's the beauty of the Blockchain. 
If you go to Japan do you "transfer your email there with you"? No. You don't. That is the point everybody is making. 


Once again, Bitcoin WAS NEVER IN ANY COUNTRY. It doesn't exist in a country. It exists in the Blockchain, which is spread across the entire globe. You can't take something "out of the country" when it was never inside of it. Your archaic definitions do not apply here. Bitcoin resides equally in anyplace I go, without me having to "transfer" it anywhere. 
You don't have to "transfer" Bitcoin to another address to get it "out of the country". Your brain is functioning in the realm of the current financial system where such a statement makes sense. With Bitcoin, it makes no sense.

Each input to a transaction can only be spent *once*. Each input must be fully spent, and any change left over is sent to a different address, which prevents this kind of attack as your replay transactions would be referencing the same inputs as the real transaction.  In fact, this is actually the normal behavior of Bitcoin, which is that all transactions are essentially replayed through the network continually to propagate them.  Nodes will receive multiple instances of the same transaction each time.  
@_date: 2014-09-01 22:55:37
No, not PayPal. PayPal has full control of all your funds. They charge fees to transact, especially internationally, and if your transaction isn't approved, then it is rejected. You cannot send money to the pirate bay, or wiki leaks for example. And good luck sending money to Snowden. Paypall can freeze your account, or anybody else's. You have to trust them with all of your funds. With bitcoin multisig, the third party escrow agent only has the ability to approve or deny one specific transaction, and they cannot do anything else. Furthermore, anybody can be a third party escrow agent with mutlisig, so there will be intense competition among escrow agents for price, service and reputation. PayPal has a monopoly on escrow services within its network.

And how many sites does an average internet user visit each day? What is the probability that they visited *at least* one site that was vulnerable? Nearly 100%.
 &gt;It's why it's a huge problem, I'll trust google than some random hombre.
Good! Perhaps you should actually use it then:




In particular, the attacker needs to become a man-in-the-middle between the attacked client and server, and to generate, block and modify client messages to the server and vice versa.
In addition, the attack requires a bypass to the browser Same Origin Policy (SOP), which is not explained in the research.




I think the most important thing from a user's perspective is to be extra cautious when connecting to untrusted networks, in particular open Wi-Fi in public areas, and avoid visiting sensitive sites (e.g. banking applications).

The problem with this idea is that you can't have stability when people are abandoning a depreciating asset for one that doesn't depreciate. 
The only reason fiat currencies have stability is because users have no other choice in which currency to use. The currency has a monopoly, which prevents desertion. If there were a choice, users would choose a currency that doesn't depreciate, or even appreciates, and abandon the poor investment.
free market currencies are an entirely different beast than monopoly mandated fiat currencies. The same principles do not apply.

You don't.  That would centralize the system, and create an external third party dependency that must be trusted.  I wasn't suggesting this as a solution.  I was just stating that Bitcoin can only get information from within itself.  
Fee's are optional, and are set by the clients to be whatever they want to be.  The problem is that the default fee is currently quite high due to the recent surge in price, so to solve this, the default fee will be lowered (proposal is to around .5 cents), and clients will listen across the network to see how low of a fee can be added that will *probably* result in the transaction being included in a block.

Every time a company starts accepting Bitcoin, it increases Bitcoin's utility and usefulness. People who were hoarding now have more options to spend their Bitcoin, and some of them might choose to do so, which may cause a decrease in the price. I don't view this as bad though. It's a necessary phase that Bitcoin has to go through. Once everybody is accepting Bitcoin (even if they are all immediately dumping it for fiat), there is a greater incentive to keep your money in Bitcoin because suppliers and other expenses can be paid.

It is needed more than food or water, because without it there would be no food or water. Can you quantify the value of sunlight?  No, because it has infinite supply.  You can only quantify the value of something when it becomes scarce, as markets will estimate its price based on supply/demand/accessibility.  
Fresh water would indeed have no value just like sunlight if it were as abundant, and as easily accessible.  Same with food, or anything else.  What is the value of the air we breath?  Value in economics must be quantifiable:   and they cannot be quantifiable unless they are scarce.


By this definition, sunlight and air have no value, and neither would food if it wasn't scarce.  Sorry dude, but your idea of value is flawed.

Your problem is that you are equating the the current price and the long term potential of Bitcoin. You need to separate those, because Bitcoin is riding high on the best adoption and overall good news its ever had while simultaneously reaching lows in the price it hasn't seen for a while. Don't equate the two.

Bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency, and it will never be a currency until it first proves itself as a commodity.  The fact that Bitcoin is treated like a commodity isn't a problem.  Gold is a commodity, and its done quite well historically.  If all Bitcoin ever becomes is a digital gold, then it will be a resounding success.  But, the reality is, that if it ever does become a digital Gold, or silver, then it will almost certainly also become a somewhat stable currency.

Ah, my mistake. You just sounded like him.
Yes, you are correct, most retailers at the moment do convert to dollars immediately, and that is expected. 
The strength of Bitcoin is that it is three things all rolled into one:
1) Payment System
2) Currency
3) Commodity
Only one of these need to succeed for Bitcoin to succeed. Different people use it for different reasons. At the moment, most merchants are using it mostly as a payment system. Is this bad? No, not at all. 
Most consumers are using it as an investment commodity. Is this bad? No, not at all. 
The currency aspect of Bitcoin won't really be possible until  and  become ubiquitous, and Bitcoin has a long history of value behind it. As more and more merchants accept Bitcoin, it gets closer and closer to *closing the loop* where merchants can accept Bitcoin, and then proceed to use it to purchase goods and services from their distributors. This is a chicken and egg problem here, and the loop cannot close until enough merchants and distributors accept Bitcoin.

Of course they are going to convert it to fiat. Volatility is high, and utility is low when compared to dollars. The point is that as more and more merchants begin to adopt Bitcoin, it's utility increases significantly until they are able to recycle Bitcoin by paying suppliers, employee's etc etc. We can't get to that point without first going through a phase where most merchants convert to dollars because running their business on Bitcoin is not yet possible. This is a necessary stepping stone.

Does libertarianism "hold the option" of government healthcare? The idea that every problem is best solved by reducing government, reducing taxes, and increasing personal liberties is definition of narrow.
Don't get me wrong, I like small government, and low taxes, but there are social problems that are probably best solved by government. 
Take healthcare for example. All the best healthcare systems in the world are government run because the incentive structure of this particular problem does not work well in a free market environment that seeks to maximize profits by reducing coverage and who can be covered.
The point is, that different problems require different solutions. Some of those problems may best be solved by free markets with fierce competition, and others by a transparent government agency with sufficient oversight. The idea that one or the other is the best solution to all problems is what is wrong with modern politics.

Oh my, the stupidity is too much to bear.  Planes have pressurized compartments which limits the air supply artificially.  35,000 feet above the ground oxygen is indeed scarce, and if we all lived up there, we'd give it a market value because people would be willing to trade for it.  You're just proving my entire point here dude.
Hospitals have masks because people's lungs fail or do not work efficiently which produces a specific scarcity to that individual and nobody else.  
Air could certainly have value, but only as its scarcity increases.  At sea level where it is abundant, nobody will give it value.

The problem is that inflationary currencies only work when people are forced to use them, and governments have the ability to do that.  When the use of a currency is *optional* like Bitcoin and other Cryptos, suddenly the incentive structures change because if you have the option of using currency A that is likely to retain its value over time, or even increase invalue, and currency B that is likely to lose value over time, most people will choose currency A because that is in their individual best interest.  Unsurprisingly, people are not thrilled to use a currency that punishes you for holding it, and unsurprisingly when given a choice, they choose the one in their best interest.  
You have to account for that, and government fiat currencies don't because they don't have to.

The problem right now isn't that there aren't enough places to spend Bitcoin. The problem is that there is little demand and incentive to go out of your way to obtain bitcoin in the first place. Every single merchant in the world could start accepting Bitcoin tomorrow and it would do little to spur adoption because every merchant I frequent already accepts my dollars. What Bitcoin needs is services like streamium that allow users to do cool things that they cant do with their dollars, and gives them a reason to actually go out and buy some Bitcoin.

No, it doesn't.  Increasing the number of slices of pizza is not the same as increasing the size of the pizza.  This is a common fallacy.  If all the pennies in the world were suddenly cut into 100 pieces, would that change the value of the dollar?  No.  Would anybody care?  Probably not.  Prices would stay the same.  The only thing that would change is that people could now potentially send micro payments to each other of smaller quantities than are now possible.  But if somebody creates *MORE* dollars, yes that decreases the value of all other dollars.
Furthermore, there are no powers that be in Bitcoin.  That is the beauty of it.  Anybody can publish any change they want, but the network as a whole has to democratically accept those changes for them to be in effect.  Bitcoin is *not software*, it is a protocol, similar to HTTP, or TCP/IP.  It doesn't matter if I change the TCP protocol, because guess what, nobody else on the internet is going to use my new version of it if they don't want to.  Everybody can use whatever version of the protocol they want, and thus changes have to be agreed upon by majority of the nodes in the network.  
I can go add more coins to the protocol right now, the code is open source, its right here: 
The hard part is getting the entire network to all voluntarily accept your changes, and if those changes are not in their best interests, aint gonna happen.  Nobody can add more coins (unless the majority of the network agrees that such a thing would be good).  There is nobody in charge of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is democracy applied to money.

One mans "hoarding" is another mans retirement, or saving to pay for college for his children.  It is not possible to remove hoarding from society, nor is it a good thing to prevent people from saving. 
Furthermore, the super rich have no need to do anything but sit on top of their mountain of dollars and watch it grow with interest.  The facts of the matter are that the wealthy of the world earn most of the newly created money, so as it stands right now, hoarding is actually incentivized by the current system even more so than in Bitcoin, because the more money I have, the more money I get.  
With Bitcoin, I am not going to increase my pile of it by sitting on top of it.  The reason the gap between the rich and poor is widening by ever larger margins is because the system is giving them the vast majority of the newly created money.  And it shouldn't be hard to figure out why.. those who have money are able to influence laws and politicians via lobbying efforts to be more beneficial towards them.


deserves to be 600x more valuable than 1USD... 
The price is only relevant in context of the supply.. There are currently over 11 trillion dollars in existence, and only 12 million Bitcoins.  That means if all things were equal (which they aren't of course), that Bitcoins should be 916,666 times more valuable than dollars as far as the units are concerned.  So the fact that Bitcoin is far far far below that number indicates that Bitcoin is indeed, much less valuable than dollars when the units are accounted for.

You obviously don't have much experience with web sites.  The more steps you require to do *anything*, the fewer people will do it.  Online shoppers have *very* short attention spans, and adding a single additional step to the purchasing process can drastically reduce sales.  You'll make far more purchases by decreasing the barrier to entry as much as possible, ie not requiring personal information.  Furthermore, I almost never give a website my personal information, as I see it as a liability.  Sites get hacked all the time and lose all their customers data.  There is almost no good that can come from it, and frankly I only trust a very small number of sites on the internet.

Yes, of course you do, and "as much as you can get for it" in the market will trend towards the production cost of the good or service.
This is called the [Cost-of-production Theory of value](
Payment processor fee's increase the costs to the merchants, and in order to stay in business, they have to pass those fee's on to customers. If a merchant doesn't have to pay processor fee's, they have two choices: 
1) Charge the same price and get additional profit (as much as you can get for it)
2) Charge less and take customers away from their competitors
Number 1 is not a valid long term strategy, because one of your competitors will eventually do Number 2, and steal customers away. Unless you plan on illegally colluding with your competitors to keep prices artificially high, the price will drop and trend towards the cost of obtaining the product, so long as there is sufficient competition in the marketplace.
When costs to produce go down, those savings are eventually passed on to customers.

Not true.  While you can usually get your money back when things go bad, there are other major problems:  You face a huge risk of identity theft and fraud.  The fact that you have to literally give a merchant the keys to your account to transact with them, and then hope they only take out as much as was agreed upon is the most absurd and ridiculous system imaginable, and so to fix this problem, the system just makes all transactions undo-able, which creates all sorts of other problems like charge-back fraud.

This is absurdly false, and is no different  than saying that because people can make significantly more money on penny stocks than the stock market, that the stock market will collapse.  You're not accounting for the risks associated with these investments.

Your *theory* about mass adoption is completely irrelevant to reality:
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that prices will continue to go up.  In fact, retailers consistently report massive surges in sales when the price of Bitcoin goes up.  Furthemore, Bitcoin doesn't need to be a currency to be successful, it is currently treated more like a commodity and a store of value, similar to Gold.  After Bitcoin has proven itself as a stable store of value, it can then transition into a stable currency, but Bitcoin has so many aspects to it that any single one of them (currency, payment system, commodity) could be successful, and only one of them needs to be at a time for Bitcoin to continue its rampage.

Very good question.  Double spending is a trivial problem to solve if you are a bank, or government, or any centralized organization because you simply keep a single ledger that is the *official* ledger, and preventing double spending on a single ledger is as simple as checking it.
Bitcoin is *decentralized*, meaning there is no central official ledger, and this is a good thing, because he who controls the ledger, controls the currency, and who can you trust with such great power?  If I controlled the ledger, I might be temped to alter the values in my account and use my power to make myself or my friends rich.  
Furthermore, governments don't like competing currencies, so they can easily shut down such a centralized currency by simply raiding the headquarters and forcing them to shutdown their servers, thus ending the currency.  A single ledger is like the single shaft that resulted in the destruction the deathstar: a critical weakness and the primary target of any attacker.
Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it has no central authority, so you don't have to trust some company, bank, or government not to abuse their power, and it is also highly resistant to being shutdown.
Now, being decentralized creates other problems however, which is the double spending problem.  If there is no central "official" ledger, then how does the network agree on which transactions are valid, and which are not?  How does the network prevent me from spending my coins twice?  Solving this problem is what has allowed Bitcoin to flourish, while all previous digital e-cash systems have failed.  It was long thought to be an un-solvable problem.

Besides, bubbles are **BAD** for Bitcoin in the long term. It destroys the currency aspect of Bitcoin due to volatility, and undermines the investing nature of Bitcoin as well. Pump and dump schemes do not attract the kinds of investors that Bitcoin needs to be successful long term.

I always find it funny when people say Bitcoin cannot work because an untested theory says it cannot. Bitcoin is the test. And so far, the theory isn't holding up well. 
The purpose of theory is to explain experimental results. If the experiment contradicts the theory, then the theory is wrong. Let us remember that it is the experiment that represents reality, not the theory.
Bitcoin has been money for several years, and is very likely to continue to be. The only requirement that money has to be called money is consensus. People are not bound by the absurd assumptions that Mises makes in his regression theorem, they can do whatever the hell they want, and if people want to come together and decide by consensus that [cans of sardines]( are money, then they are money.

The thing that people don't realize about Bitcoin is that nobody could have predicted its rise to popularity out of obscurity. Any reasonable and intelligent person in 2008 would have never considered that it would be as popular as it is, despite its obviously ingenious design. One doesn't just create something like Bitcoin that takes over the world, and consider this just a small part of some sinister plot with ulterior motives.If the first step of your sinister plan requires creating a globally distributed ledger maintained by thousands and thousands of volunteers because they have been convinced that the numbers in this ledger will be valuable, then you're suffering from a hindsight bias because this "plan" is anything but reasonable pre 2008.

You're assuming oxygen has value in the first place, which it doesn't at the moment due to an abundance of supply. Utility is not the same as value. The value of any good can always be zero if there is no demand, as you mentioned, but also if there is abundant supply, as is the case of oxygen. We're literally swimming in it, which is why you've never paid a cent for every breath of air you've taken since birth.

Surbitcoin.com is an online exchange based in NY that hooks up with Venezuelan banks. I use it to send money to my Venezuelan friends. They sell the bitcoin on the exchange for Bolivars (at a fantastic exchange rate might I add, since all official channels of sending money use government mandated exchange rates that are completely out of touch with the real market). Surbitcoin uses the same bank as everybody else in Venezuela (Banesco) so Bolivar withdrawls are almost instant, since its just transferring money within the same bank.
I can get money to my Venezuelan friends bank accounts faster than I can get money to my landlord via "online billpay" through my bank.

How much do you pay for all the oxygen you breath? Utility is not the same as value. The value of oxygen is essentially zero because supply is so abundant. We're literally swimming in the stuff. The value of any good can always go to zero either via a lack of demand, or an abundance of supply. Value is created by the interaction of limited supply, and sufficient demand, neither of which are guaranteed to be constant.. For anything. Therefore there is no such thing as intrinsic value.

The theory is correct. Bitcoin is a shitty currency by modern standards because it doesnt incentivize you to get rid of it.. but thats precisely why its so successful, and will continue to be. 
Bitcoin is meant to be digital gold, not a currency. It *can be used as a currency*, but that isn't its appeal to most people, that is simply a bonus. Its appeal is that it is designed to be a good store of value due to its strongly enforced scarcity, and freedom from politicians, corporations and other third parties. I dont spend my Bitcoins because I value them much more than I value my dollars. This doesn't mean Bitcoin is doomed to fail, it means it is bound to succeed as commodity money. There will never be a shortage of countries with shitty monetary policies, and Bitcoin will act as an escape valve.

There is no such thing as "intrinsic value". All value is created from the interaction of limited supply and non-zero demand. The value of any good can go to zero either via demand going to zero, or via supply going to infinity. (Yes even food).
There is nothing in the laws of physics stating that humans must agree upon a minimum quantity of value for anything. All value is subject to change or disappear, there is absolutely nothing "intrinsic" about it.

You're completely missing the point. As I said, the problem is how long it takes for money to arrive at its destination. Not everybody accepts CC, why don't you understand this? I can't use a CC to pay for things that don't accept CC. Furthermore, let me explain where CC gets their money from that they "Pay" you with.. YOU. Visa charges the merchants, and the merchants raise their prices to cover the cost, so YOU end up paying.
They're literally taking two dollars out of your left pocket, and placing one in your right pocket, and convincing you that they're giving you money for free.
Bottom line, I can get money in my Venezuelan friends account faster than I can in your account. Period the end. CC don't solve that at all. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:06:13
Yes it does cost more, YOU clearly haven't looked, including RIGHT NOW.
Highest price to sell BTC is 1,981,518 right now on Localbitcoins
Surbitcoin is 2,185,000.
Surbitcoin has always been better on price every time I've looked. 
Second, I didn't realize that you could actually buy and sell Bitcoin entirely online now with Localbitcoins? Is this true? Localbitcoins used to be for only in person meetups, and I've avoided it for that very reason. If this is true then I stand corrected. 
Regardless, **volume is much lower on LB**, and you cannot trade without communicating with somebody first, making it more inconvenient. With surbitcoin, I send bitcoin to my friend via my phone, he sends BTC to surbitcoin via his phone, sells it, and transfers to bank. Super simple and fast. He has bolivars in his account in under 60 minutes sometimes, depending on block times.

The exchange uses the bank.. its not the exchanges transaction, its the banks. If me and you both have Wells Fargo, and I send money to your account, you can expect it to arrive in *minutes*. It doesnt matter if the account belongs to Bill Gates or you or me, or a "beta" exchange. The account holder doesn't make the transaction go faster or slower. I have no idea where you get that silly idea from.  
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:01:23
Its because Bitcoin transactions are final after a few minutes, and pretty much everything else in the financial system isn't final for at least 3 to 5 business days or longer. This creates an imbalance. If you sell me a Bitcoin for dollars, then the next day the bank informs you that the transaction will be reverted due to fraud, you lose the Bitcoin and the money I paid you because the Bitcoin transaction cannot be reverted, but the dollar transaction can be.

Having boots on the ground is not a solution to sending money to Venezuela. You are changing the subject. I have boots on the ground, I have many friends there.
Also, the Bolivar went up in price. If you were holding DOLLARS, you lost just as much value as if you were holding BTC. This wasnt a drop in BTC. It was an increase in Bolivar. Bolivar went up relative to EVERYTHING. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:13:57
The volume is certainly not anything like the big exchanges, but the spread isn't too bad (~2%), especially when you consider the absurd exchange rate of other channels of transferring money which give you a mere fraction of your value.
Bitcoin is in pretty high demand over there.. access to dollars is illegal, and they're overpriced on the black market. Bolivars are depreciating like crazy. Highest inflation in the world right now. Bitcoin is a godsend for those who know about it.

Using Bitcoin, I can get Bolivars in my friends Bank account in under 30 minutes, at a fantastic exchange rate mind you.

3) Its inconvenient having to meet somebody in person when you can buy/sell from your phone
3) It costs more. 
4) Its dangerous. People avoid showing their smartphones in public because rates of theft and robery are incredibly high.

Surbitcoin.com is a venezuelan bitcoin exchange. They sell the Bitcoin for Venezuelan Bolivars. Since there's really only one bank in Venezuela, transfers from surbitcoin to their accounts are instantaneous. So I can send them Bitcoin, and they can have Bolivars in their account in under 30 minutes.
Furthermore, if I tried to send dolars through the banking system, they'd receive only a small fraction of the money I sent due to the manipulated exchange rate the Venezuelan government mandates. Bitcoin bypasses that false exchange rate entirely.

No.. it does take a lot of time. I have a CC but you clearly don't understand how CC's work either. First off, there is a non trivial fee to accept CC (Where do you think they get that money they "pay" you to use CC with? The MERCHANT). Second, CC transactions take at LEAST 3 days to settle, and often take weeks. Furthermore still, transactions can be reversed and disputed after the fact. Just because you go to the store and buy something with your credit card that seems "instantaneous" to you, doesn't mean it is for the retailer. They aren't guaranteed that that money you gave them is theirs for a long time after.

I find it hilarious that you seem to think transfers within the same bank can't be fast and that I'm somehow making that up to further the Bitcoin agenda or something. I'm no bitcoin fanatic. I'm just a pragmatist, and there is literally no better way to send money to Venezuela than Bitcoin due to the governments crack down on monetary exchange. 
I've sent probably around 2 BTC over the last several months, but not all to the same guy. I have several friends there. I lived in Venezuela for two years between 2002 and 2004. Made a lot of friends, and its sad to see the shit they have to endure. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:23:00
Well, thats a little innacurrate. The truth is that the price of the Bolivar shot up due to restricted supply. The Dollar/Bolivar rate went down by just as much. This is an increase in Demand for the Bolivar, not a decrease in demand for Bitcoin specifically.

1) Keeping money in socks is a terrible idea when your currency has the highest rate of inflation in the world
2) Paypal is not available, and US dollars are hard to come by, and must be bought on the black market since it is illegal to buy them without Gov approval
3) Gold/Silver are good for storing wealth if you can actually find any. Venezuelans are completely lacking in necessities like toilet paper, food, medicine etc. Gold and Silver are not easy to come by.
4) It is illegal to buy Euros without Gov approval, and they would have to be bought on the black market, but the black market focuses on the USD. I'm not sure Euros are even available on the black market. 
5) Designer bags? Good luck finding any. 
I'm not saying Bitcoin is the end all be all here, but you don't know at all what its like down there right now. Bitcoin bypasses all Government regulations and government mandated exchange rates. In the USA, these features don't really matter that much because we have a fantastic currency and economic freedom for the most part, but in Venezuela, they have none of that. I've been using Bitcoin to feed some families I know down there, and its literally the absolute best way to send money to Venezuela right now because going through the banking system exposes you to the Venezuelan governments false exchange rate which steals 99% of your money.

The main cause of shortages of goods is the governments socialists policies. Foremost among them are government mandated prices for goods and services. The artificially low prices cause an increase in demand, and a decrease in supply, resulting in shortages. 
Furthermore, the artifically low prices force producers out of business as they cant make a profit. Furthermore still, the forced prices heavily incentivize arbitrage of Venezuelan goods by selling them at market prices eslewhere like Colombia, causing more shortages. Its a huge fucking downward spiral, and the worst part is that its all self imposed.
Couple this with intense capital controls, artificial exchange rates, pilfering of private corporations, denying access to USD (companies need USD to buy supplies), corruption and a million other economicly disastrous decisions and you've got Venezuela.

Dude, my landlord doesn't accept CC for every reason you just listed, and why should she? I certainly wouldn't. CC fraud rates are quite high, and the merchants usually take the hit.
I have several credit cards, and I buy pretty much everything I can with them, but you're missing the entire point here, which is that credit cards do not send money quickly. You're confusing how long it takes for the transaction to occur with how long it takes for the money to actually arrive at its destination. If I send you a payment via CC right now, you won't get jack for several days, and even when you do, the bank can reverse the transaction if they find out I used a stolen CC. Then you've lost whatever you sold me, and the money I used to pay for it. 
I can get money in my Venezuelan friends account faster than I can in your account. Period the end. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:14:24
Lol boots on the ground? Yeah, the best way to send money to Venezuela is to fly there personally and deliver it yourself? You have no idea what you're talking about.
The BTC/Bolivar rate dropped because the Dollar/Bolivar rate dropped because Maduro ordered the elimination of all 100 Bolivar Bills. Supply went down, demand went up, price went up. The Bolivar will continue sliding down.

You mean a legit Venezuelan? I know these people because I lived abroad there for two years, but Im not sure how you could verify legit families in need without knowing them personally (though to be honest you'll be hard pressed to find any family living there that isn't in some kind of need). Everybody that had the means to leave has done so already.  R/vzla has a ton of people in it that are actually living in Venezuela right now. You could perhaps stalk a few members by reading their past comments to see what kind of need they may be in, and try and verify they are legit, and then PM them?
Now that I think about it, I think it would be awesome for r/Bitcoin to do a charity drive for r/vzla Im just not sure how we could verify proper use of the funds.

It makes no sense to say the price is expected to go up, because if that were true everybody would be buying right now and the price would be going up until it reaches the point at which it is no longer expected to go up.

Its a Cryptocurrency. Which is to say it is neither, because it is something entirely different. It is four things rolled into one cohesive system. A currency, a commodity, a payment system, and a distributed peer to peer ledger. You can't examine Bitcoin without taking all four of these into consideration. This is the mistake Krugman makes. He knows a lot about currencies and therefore thinks he knows about Bitcoin despite the fact that he doesn't know anything at all about payment systems and peer to peer ledgers.

The value of Bitcoin is determined the same way as everything else: Its worth as much as people are willing to pay for it. Supply and demand set the price. Since demand for Bitcoin has been increasing since its inception, and since supply is increasing slower and slower over time, the price *tends* upward over time. However, Bitcoin is not without challenges. Its is pretty much maxed out right now on the number of transactions the network can support, and there have been ongoing debates about if and how to scale the network up. In my mind, the only thing that can stop Bitcoin is Bitcoin itself. I'm optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, but I wouldn't put more money into Bitcoin than you can stand to lose. Its a high risk high reward game here.

I send Bitcoin to my friend (Yes, I've done this at least 5 times), he immediately sells it on the surbitcoin.com exchange, which has instant transfers to his own bank account since everybody uses the same bank in Venezuela. 
This is done all ONLINE, from our PHONES, in under 30 minutes (usually, sometimes the network is slow and it can take longer depending on how long it takes to find blocks). You're the one being disingenuous here, there are no meetups in person. **I send Bitcoin, he has spendable bolivars in his bank account 30 minutes later. Keep trying dude.**

You just hit on one of the most beautiful aspects of Bitcoin. *Multisig* allows you to send a transaction where a majority of individuals must agree for the transaction to go through, which allows you to create an escrow service where the escrow doesn't have full control over the funds. All they can do is approve the transaction, or disallow the transaction. They have no other control over the funds. If there is no dispute, and you and I agree, then we have the majority of signatures (2/3) and the transaction goes through. If there is a disagreement, then and only then does the escrow look at the situation, and pick a side, ending the debate.
So yes, there is a third party here, but their involvement only really comes into play in a dispute, and they have very limited powers. Unlike traditional escrow agents, which can freeze or outright steal the funds.

Big O is simply a measure of how hard a problem is to solve.  For example, if I place a lot of rocks on a table and ask you to count them. How hard is that problem compared to if I ask you to sort the rocks in order of weight?
Counting them requires you to consider each rock once, so if there are N rocks, then counting is O(n) hard. If you sort the rocks by considering each pair of rocks until you find the smallest, and then considering the rest until you find the next smallest, and so on, then you will have considered around N^2 comparisons, so this sorting algorithm is O(N^2 ) hard.
So in summary, if there are N rocks, then counting those rocks requires N considerations, while sorting those rocks with a basic sorting algorithm requires N^2 considerations. (Note that there are better sorting algorithms that can sort fewer than N^2 considerations, but still greater than N considerations).

Furthermore, the addresses are protected against random changes like typing a 2 instead of a 1. I suggest you go and try it. Take your address, modify a character, and try to send some dust to the modified address. It will detect the invalid address with very high probability.Escrow services using multisig can provide chargeback like services (but better).The future of bitcoin is all the services built on top of it that abstract away all the technicalities that you are worried about.

I don't think you understand just how inefficient blockchains are. They would gain very little in benefits because blockchains were created to solve a VERY different problem. If you can't trust yourself then crypto currency is WORSE because it requires even more security as you are unable to undo any damage that has been done. Furthermore it opens you up to external threats with mining attacks and all sorts of other potential problems with nothing to gain for it, including massive scalability problems and non-instant transactions. If this is their plan, then they will be at a huge disadvantage to their competitors. Blockchain usage in this scenario is beyond idiotic.

Bitcoin is best for international internet transactions, micro transactions (tipping), anonymous transactions (black markets), transactions that dont reveal personal information, transactions that don't involve banks in any way (fees), transactions where there is little or no trust between transactees (Nigerian Prince), or simply a very simple way for an automated systems to send value to random a internet user without knowing anything at all about that user apart from their Bitcoin address.
There is also the benefit that Bitcoin cannot be deflated away by central banks. It cannot be frozen or controlled by politicians, and it is proving to be a good hedge against financial ruin caused by the absurdities of the modern financial system. Seems to me like a damn good thing to have in your portfolio.

Because my brother qualifies for *free healthcare* under medicaid now, which is full coverage for everything and far superior than what my parents have. Why don't my parents have free healthcare as well you ask? Oh that's because they live in Texas, and Texas refused the free money from the Fed to pay for it, otherwise they would have it. Instead they had to purchase healthcare in the exchange, and amazingly they could actually afford despite the fact that they make less than $20k a year. The reason they could afford it is because they qualified for subsidies which covered 90% of the cost.

Yeah.. and have you ever stopped to consider *why* fee's have dropped over time? Fee's have changed because the fee itself *used to be fixed and hard-coded*. This resulted in wild fluctuations of the value of the fee as the price skyrocketed and developers took time to manually adjust the fee. That is no longer an issue, as the fee's are now no longer hard-coded and float freely according to the market. Since that time, there has been a direct correlation between total fee revenue and transaction count.

No, that's 100% accurate description of your logical argument. You even admit it in your next line when you change your wording to include the word "likely", admitting that this is a matter of probability, and thus an "appeal to probability". You literally just modified your argument to be the *exact* definition of appeal to probability. This is quite humorous. You are making an inductive argument ("likely"), and then attempting to use it deductively. 


If you don't know the probability of the premise, you cannot know the probability of the conclusion.
Furthermore, even if we assume that your faulty premise is true, your conclusion is *still* erroneous. The word "genius" has no strict definition that implies that that individual must make an advancement in such a way that no other individual *probably* have made the same advancement shortly thereafter. This definition of yours is completely fabricated and not inline with the general usage of the word 'genius', which is simply:


Your attempts to use logic to prove something as subjective as the attribute of 'genius' are doomed to fail.
I can use your logic to make the same argument that Isaac Newton wasn't a genius (Leibniz discovered calculus independently at exactly the same time), and its use to describe the motion of the planets was thus clearly inevitable. One could say the same thing of Einstein, as special relativity is a direct logical consequence of the fact that the speed of light is constant, which was demonstrated in 1881. Einstein thought up the special theory of relativity without discovering anything new, but by merely combining what was already known in a logical way. So, he's definitely *not* a genius either. I'd like to know who you actually consider to be a genius, as its quite literally impossible to prove that nobody else would have made similar discoveries shortly thereafter any discovery. 


No, its a 100% accurate description of your logical argument, in which you make an [inductive argument]( (some advancements occur at the same time), and attempt to use it deductively (Bitcoin is an advancement, therefore one like it would have occurred at the same time). This is against the rules of logic.

That's why I said "at this point in its existence". Governments can 100% make Bitcoin more difficult to use, and push it underground if they wanted to, and prevent companies from publicly accepting it. This would only delay the inevitable in my mind, but if you think governments can't affect the value of Bitcoin in the slightest then you are fooling yourself. For example, the US could have sold all its confiscated coins on the open market and dropped the value quite significantly. They still have a ton of coins left and they could do that if they wanted to be malicious. It wouldn't be the end of Bitcoin of course, but it would affect the value for a period of time. Fortunately, the US gov has been "relatively" nice when it comes to Bitcoin.

So what? Nobody cares if you make hidden money, it doesn't hurt the network, and it doesn't undermine the protocol if you simply follow the protocol. If you can gain 65% of the hashing power of the network, then you deserve 65% of the block rewards. You also have a vested interest in keeping the network profitable, which means doing nothing malicious. There is no harm in this scenario. The only harm comes if you start denying transactions, or attempting double spends, or doing something nefarious with your expensive miners, which would ultimately  undermine your entire investment. The incentives in this scenario are for you to simply follow the protocol and earn block rewards, which is exactly as it should be.

Python is a great language for small projects and quick scripts, but it doesn't scale well to very large code bases and projects due to dynamic typing. There are entire classes of bugs that you will not discover until runtime that other languages will immediately find during the compilation phase.  
Facebook discovered that dynamic languages do not scale well, and so they created their own version of PHP with static typing. One of the first things they discovered when porting over their code to statically typed PHP was the massive number of bugs that lay hidden in the original code base that were uncovered immediately by a compiler.
Google came to the same conclusion, and added static typing to javascript with Dart, and Microsoft did the exact same thing as Google with Typescript.
Static typing is one of those things that is somewhat of a nuisance for small projects and tools, but it quickly becomes invaluable as the project gets larger and more complicated with many different developers all working on the same code base.  
On top of all that, Python is dreadfully slow, and all the versions of OpenBazaar I've tried out so far have been completely plagued with performance issues. This isn't to say that the project is doomed of course, but its clear to me that the team chose Python because that is what they were most familiar with, and not because it is the best tool for the job.

Such a scheme is utterly pointless and offers no benefits over simply providing a limited public API to a bank controlled SQL database. If you're going to have centralized control, there is no benefit in solving a problem that doesn't exist anymore now that you have a centralized system. The Blockchain solves the double spending problem, which only exists in systems where there is no centralized control and where you cannot trust all nodes. In systems where there is centralized control, and where you *can* trust the nodes, then you no longer have a double spending problem that cannot be easily resolved.

The truth is that centralized bitcoin banks (like coinbase, bitpay etc) will do most transactions off chain, and Bitcoin's lack of scalability has nothing to do with it. Transactions will be mostly off chain for usability, convenience, speed, and reliability.

This guy has never heard of multisig for escrow, he's completely ignorant.With Bitcoin and multisig, I can safely purchase merchandise from the Nigerian prince's web store, and I can also safely accept purchases from the Nigerian prince himself because there is no way for him to defraud me as either a buyer or seller. The next time the Nigerian prince sends you an email go ahead and tell him you accept bitcoin.Nobody in their right mind would do either of these with a credit card, check or any other convenient form of payment. I can do this internationally without worrying about fraud because Bitcoin doesn't transfer IOUs back and forth like a credit card, it transfers value. This is its great strength because transferring IOUs means that the buyer needs to be vetted and trusted. The entire system requires trust to function properly, and so it naturally excludes all those who are deemed untrustworthy, even if this is determined merely by their country of origin. Bitcoin require no trust to function, and excludes nobody.  It's is the internet of money, not merely money for the internet.

Yes, there absolutely is a logical fallacy, its called [Appeal to probability](


Apart from that, your logical assertion lacks proof


Your premises are not provable, and therefore your conclusion is erroneous. There is absolutely no way at all to prove that somebody else would have discovered Blockchain tech "around the same time". Your statement is a matter of opinion, not fact, and thus your conclusion is just as false as your assumption. 
While it is true that historically *some* advancements are discovered by multiple individuals independently at around the same time, that absolutely does not imply that *all* advancements must be discovered by multiple individuals independently at around the same time, and therein lies your logical fallacy, or Appeal to probability.

The issue here is that you cannot separate Bitcoin from the Blockchain for the same reason you cannot separate numbers from a traditional ledger. It's not a matter of opinion, its a matter of fact, and one that is so misunderstood by almost everybody who comments on it. Blockchains can only operate on block-coins. They are the numbers in the distributed ledger, and without them you no longer have a ledger, and the blockchain has no purpose.

If you want to buy/sell quickly as you mentioned, then you'll need to send money to an exchange.

Because its a dynamically typed language, which means that there are several classes of bugs that you will have to find on your own without the aid of a compiler. Statically typed languages, like C, C++, Java, C Scala etc all have compilers that check your code for all sorts of bugs before you even attempt to execute it. 
With Python, there is no such tool, and these bugs won't usually be discovered until you actually execute the buggy code, and even then, because a bug is so subtle, you may never discover it, or even be made aware of its existence. 
Dynamically typed languages like Python are very pleasant to use for smaller projects where the complexity isn't too great, and performance isn't that important (Dynamically typed languages are significantly slower), but they do not scale well to larger more complex projects as it becomes more difficult to reason about the code, and the assistance of a compiler to check all the code before it is ever executed for bugs becomes more and more of a crucial benefit. 
It is for this reason, that both Google and Microsoft created a statically typed version of Javascript, and Facebook created a statically typed version of PHP. (Both Javascript and PHP are dynamically typed languages).

I don't think you understand. Blockchains are incredibly wasteful, insecure, and inefficient if you are going to centralize them. Blockchains actually become significantly worse than a standard databases if they are centralized. There is no reason you cannot make public a standard database ledger if transparency is what you want. Blockchains and centralized entities literally do not mix in any beneficial way whatsoever. We already have very good centralized solutions, Blockchains do absolutely nothing to make them better. Its amazing to me how few people understand this.

Libertarianism is about freedom to choose, and if people choose to have their private keys hosted by third parties then that is fine and well, and so long as there is sufficient competition in the marketplace, then these services will compete for features, customers and security, which is great. That's just the free market doing its thing. 
Furthermore, the current financial system is chock full of "Guidelines", which have not helped one bit in preventing the financial crisis, and have probably contributed to it as the very strict regulations prevent adequate competition from forming in the marketplace. The regulators were literally working for the banks and turning a blind eye as they watched all the "guidelines" go out the window.

In all things, you have intrinsic properties and nothing else, not just Bitcoin. Pointing out that a gold coin contains the property of being minted into a fine coin is just another property. There is no fundamental distinction here between Bitcoin and Gold or Silver besides tangibility, which is yet again, just another intrinsic property.I am simply saying that the phrase "intrinsic value" is frequently used in circular logic type arguments, where it is asserted that a thing must have a base value because it is valued. It's utter nonsense and it stems from the fact that the phrase "intrinsic value" implies that there is some law of nature that insists that humans must give some minimum level of value to some entity."Intrinsic properties" gives the proper logical meaning, and makes such circular logic readily obvious.

This is so beyond naive its hard to believe. And even if it were true, it would destroy Bitcoin by centralizing mining, and the value of Bitcoin would go to zero. 21Inc will be limited in what kind of miners they can put in consumer devices, and how much power they can draw. This will prevent them from running the latest most efficient mining hardware. Massive mining shops with nearly free or subsidized energy will compete just fine because they'll be running far more efficient miners than what can be realistically embedded in a router.  


$14.60 a year is an absolute theoretical MAXIMUM assuming they have 100% mining market share (which ironically would destroy the value of Bitcoin). Take into account the block reward halving, competition, and the fact that 21Inc has to actually pay for the hardware and make a profit, there isn't much mining revenue left for subsidy. The actual amount that can be subsidized is more along the lines of a dollar, maybe two, *per year if they're lucky*, and that's completely ignoring the fact that only an idiot would buy this hardware because they'll be paying significantly more than that in electricity bills.


Lol. Right.

"Intrinsic value" is an oxymoron. Value is entirely a creation of the human mind, and as such it is subject to change according to the irrational psychological whims that govern said mind. 
This is the exact opposite of the meaning of the word "intrinsic". There is no intrinsic value, only *intrinsic properties*. Gold has intrinsic properties that *some* humans find useful or valuable for whatever reason they decide, and that reason need not be rational. There is no law of physics that states that we humans must give value to Gold. 
Bitcoin also has intrinsic properties that many people find useful and valuable, but it has no intrinsic value because *nothing* has intrinsic value because there is no such thing. All value is subject to change, and nothing is immune from having zero or near zero value. 
At the current moment in time, Bitcoin has superior intrinsic *properties* to Gold and Silver, and I therefore value it more than either, but I refuse to say that it or anything else has intrinsic value.

There are no Bitcoin Bonds, no, and if you're looking for a steady interest rate with the stability and safety of a Bond, then Bitcoin is not what you are looking for. Bitcoin has other properties however that are desirable, like the fact that there will only ever be 21 million of them ever created, so when you purchase a Bitcoin, or a fraction of a Bitcoin, you are owning a fraction of the entire Bitcoin economy, and that fraction will never change. 
Bitcoin is more than just a currency, commodity, or even a payment system however. Its the foundation of a brand new financial system which has only just barely started, and makes possible many things that are impossible in the traditional financial system.
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:30:50
It's more than just incentives. Bitcoin is the fundamental unit of accounting on the blockchain. There is nothing special about Bitcoins themselves, as they are just numbers. The reason that these particular numbers have value is because the blockchain gives them value by securing them and giving them features like direct transferability. You can't separate them for the same reason you can't separate variables from algebra. Algebra operates on variables, and it doesn't make sense to talk about algebra outside of the context of variables.

Imagine you have an asset, anything, like a bunch of snickers bars for example, and you wish to sell them. You go to a large room full of people, some of which want to buy snickers, and some of which want to sell snickers. Everybody takes out a small piece of paper and writes the value that they are willing to sell/buy their snickers for. Then, you place all the buyers on the left side of the room, and the sellers on the right side of the room, and sort each group into a line by the price on their piece of paper. When finished, the buyers form a sorted line with the guy willing to buy for the most at the front of the line (Sellers will obviously favor this guy since he's willing to pay the most). The guy at the front of the sellers line is willing to sell for less than all of the other sellers, so the buyers will obviously favor him first. 
Now, lets say the first buyer (offering highest price) is willing to pay $1.00 for a snickers bar, and the first seller (offering lower price) is willing to sell a snickers bar for $1.10. There is a *spread* of 10 cents here, and nothing happens until either a seller gets tired of waiting for his desired price and walks over to the front of the buyers line and sells to him at his price, or a buyer gets tired of waiting and walks over to the sellers line and buys at the sellers price. 
Now, imagine that some dude friggin loves Snickers bars, and he doesn't really give a damn what price he pays, he just needs $1000 worth of snickers NOW. So he goes to the front of the sellers line, buys all that dudes snickers for the cheapest possible price ($1.10), then moves up to the next guy who is selling at a slightly higher price ($1.15), buys all his snickers and proceeds to move his way up the line. What is happening to the price at which one can now buy snickers? It's shooting up very fast because some guy keeps buying them at higher and higher prices, leaving only the dudes in the back of the sellers line who were selling for much higher.
Now, the sellers farther back in the line see this crazy guy buying up the line, so some of them take out their pencils and erase their original price, replacing it with one much higher, hoping that the buyer will keep buying and eventually buy their snickers at an even higher price and make more money. 
The crazy snickers dude eventually stops buying and the sellers are now selling snickers at $5.00 a pop for the cheapest offering at the front of the line. Now imagine what would happen if this guy turned around and sold all his snickers to the buyers in like manner. The price would drop as he eats up each buyers offer in the line and works his way to the back of the line where buyers are only willing to pay $.10 for a snickers bar. 
The key point here is that the current price for any good is simply the last price at which it was bought or sold in a market where people are able to choose whatever price they desire.

Yes, bitcoin is perfectly legal unless you live in North Korea or perhaps Iran. Its even legal in Venezuela of all places.

Bitcoin acceptance is great, but it doesn't drive adoption or buying pressure.

The important thing to note about this technology is that the more people that use it, the cheaper it will be. The fact that Bitcoin can undercut the traditional system despite all the conversion steps it has to go through and despite the fact that liquidity is relatively low for the Bitcoin market is amazing. Bitcoin remittances are only going to get cheaper as liquidity and volume increase, and eventually the loop will start to close as people realize they don't need to convert to their local currency, and that's when things start to get really interesting.

I disagree somewhat with your comments on the network effect. The network effect is absolutely not a fallacy, its very real. However, as you stated, the existence of the network effect doesn't guarantee anything. It simply means there needs to be something with enough incentive to overcome the network effect, which is of course certainly possible, but unlikely at this stage in my opinion. 
Bitcoin is venturing into unexplored territory, and until Bitcoin has proven that this is a viable path to tread, the viability of lesser competitors is even more questionable. The most important goal in the crypto-currency industry right now is to prove the long term viability of the idea, which creates a unifying incentive to combine forces. Once the idea has been proven, then you'll see a plethora of competitors vying for a place on the newly laid foundation, but make no mistake, any competitors will have to be pretty damn awesome to create an incentive large enough to switch.

You're missing the point here. Gold has intrinsic *attributes*, but the value that we assign to those attributes is entirely circumstantial and subject to change. The attributes are indeed "intrinsic", but the value isn't.
Give a man a bar of Gold who is on a deserted Island and starving for food and water and Gold is worthless to him. He'd trade all the gold in the world for a glass of water to prevent death. What happened to the supposed "intrinsic" value of Gold in this situation? It never had any to begin with. 
Value itself is subjective and relative, which is the exact opposite of the meaning of the word "intrinsic", thus making the word "Intrinsic-value" and oxymoron. Gold has intrinsic Attributes, that many humans happen to find valuable at the moment, but there is absolutely no guarantee that this will remain true in all circumstances and in the future.
Obsidian was incredibly valuable to the native american Indians due to its intrinsic properties, but has little value to modern society because we have more abundant alternatives. Circumstances change, and "value" does with it.

It doesn't matter if 95% of miners agreed. Miners provide supply, but they do not provide demand. If the blockchain forks and most miners go one way, and nodes, developers, merchants and users go the other way, then the users win in the long run. Miners go where the money is, and the money is where the demand is, and the demand is where the users and merchants are. Miners do not have as much power as is commonly believed. Creating your own fork does no good if there are no users on board. The number of miners is irrelevant.

It's actually not complicated at all from the merchant side if you use a payment processor like bitpay. All you see is dollars going into your account when a transaction is made. Furthermore, there is no risk of chargeback or fraud. Transactions are irreversible. With Bitcoin, you can safely accept payment from all those Nigerian prince's. Something you wouldn't dare do with a credit card. Also, you can MAKE MORE MONEY as it opens up your customer base to the entire world, and fees are much smaller.

Implementing a project of that scale in Python was a poor decision IMO. One thing I've learned as a developer is to always use the best tool for the job, even if its not familiar to you, and Python is *not* the best tool for this job.
There's a reason why Facebook added *static typing* to PHP, and Google and Microsoft both added it to Javascript: Large projects do not scale well with dynamic languages.  Open Bazaar also had major performance issues last time I tried it.

Yes there is a spectrum here with benefits and trade-offs all along it, though I don't really see how those languages have "unsound" type systems. Care to elaborate?
I really wish I were a pure functional programmer, as I found that some complicated problems suddenly become simple in functional programming, but I simultaneously discovered that some simple problems suddenly become more complex (you know what they are). 
Obviously those developers who overcome the learning curve associated with pure functional programming are probably living in some sort of higher dimension programming paradise, but I have yet to achieve that level. For the moment, I prefer the hybrid languages that let you use some functional concepts in tandem with imperative programming, like Scala, and I pretty much use C Linq statements on immutable generators all over the place such that usually nothing actually evaluates until the last line of the program.

First, Bitcoin is inflating at more than 10% a year at the moment. It won't be deflationary for many years to come. Second, moderate deflation isn't any different from moderate inflation. People routinely focus on the downsides of deflation by saying it discourages people from buying, but that is only looking at a small part of the picture. There is no "best solution" in the deflation vs inflation debate, there are simply trade-offs (like nearly all complex problems). 
Inflation encourages buying, and simultaneously *discourages* selling. Why sell now when I can wait and get more money?
Deflation encourages selling, and simultaneously *discourages* buying. Why buy now when I can wait and pay less money?
Neither of these are problematic so long as the inflation/deflation is *moderate*. Extreme inflation is just as bad as extreme deflation. However, historically extreme inflation is [far more common]( than extreme deflation.
There are also other problems that arise with supply inflation, like how do you distribute the newly created money into the system? If all the newly created money were equally distributed among the population, then inflation wouldn't be a problem. The problem arises when central banks use their power to print money to indirectly extract wealth from the poor and give it to the rich. The US government has been printing tens of billions of dollars a month for many years as part of QE. Who got all that money? It wasn't you and me. Fortunately none of that money has circulated through the economy yet, but it will some day.

Bitcoin deflation will not be a problem.  Let me demonstrate why.  The deflationary argument says that people won't spend money that they believe will be worth more in the future, correct?  And yet, that is *effectively* what we all do every single day with our dollars.
Why did you buy that cup of coffee this morning when you could have placed that money in an index fund tracking the S&amp;P 500, which has earned 10% interest per year on average since its inception?  *Why did you spend money that you are certain will be worth more in the future if you had simply invested it?* 
Only 53% of Americans have any money at all invested in the stock market, and those that do only invest a relatively small portion of their surplus income, despite the fact that the most 'rational' thing to do, and the thing which people are incentivized to do, is to invest it.  
Why is this?  *Its because not everybody is capable of saving money, and most that do save money do it with the intent to eventually buy*.  They do not save money just for the sake of saving money.  People will hoard bitcoins while they increase in value, until the temptation to buy that new car, or that new house, or take a trip to hawaii is too great, and they break down and spend it.  Very few people have the discipline to act rationally in their best long term interest when it comes to money.  The deflationary argument assumes that everybody acts like Warren Buffet, a billionaire who lives a modest life-style, preferring to invest the majority of his surplus income.  The reality of the matter is that most people act like Ex-NFL football players, spending money impulsively on shiny objects.
Everybody already has the capability of increasing their money over time via investing, and yet the vast majority prefer to spend it because, psychologically, the certainty of having that shiny object right now is more tempting than the possibility of a larger fortune in the future.

Yes, bitcoin can be adapted if need be.  And no, bitcoin actually **doesn't use any encryption**.  It uses SHA-256 hashing, and ECDSA signatures.  Some clients encrypt the wallet.dat file, but this is not part of the bitcoin protocol.  Also, it will take A VERY VERY VERY VERY long time before computers even come closing to being able to crack ECDSA signatures.  Billions of years long.

Bitcoins absolutely offer safe storage if done properly, and in some ways are safer than banks.  Just ask anybody who's had their bank account frozen, or the citizens of cyprus who were in the process of having their savings taken away to pay off national debt.  How safe is your money when it is not in your control?  Bitcoin offers something that banks can never offer, which is full control of your money, which is a dimension of safety that a bank can never provide.  
Stashing your money in a treasure box renders it unusable and unspendable.  With bitcoin, I can stash my money in the metaphorical treasure box buried in my back yard, and still use it to conduct near instant international transactions to anybody in the world.  Furthermore, I can take that treasure box with me anywhere I go.
Yes, there are significant advantages to having money in an FDIC insured bank.  I have the vast majority of my money in one.  And yes, you are right, it is not correct to say that bitcoin lets you be a bank in every single literal sense of the word, but it does let people be their own bank with regards to what most people care about these days, which is moving their money around the world electronically.  
I haven't had cash in my wallet for about a year straight, and when I do, its a small amount.  I have no need for it, and its too inconvenient.  Cash doesn't let me buy things on the internet, which is where I spend most of my money.  
Bitcoin will never replace banks as I see it, but there will be people in the future (if bitcoin succeeds) who have no bank account but do have a bitcoin account.  Email never replaced mail, and bitcoin will never replace its predecessors either.  It does some things better, and for those things, it will be used.  But it doesn't do everything better, and it doesn't provide a complete replacement for banks.  (Though one day, it, or something like it, may...)

e-bay is the absolute worst place to buy bitcoins, as the seller can just not send them to you and you lose out.  Virtual goods are not covered.  Plus, they are charging a massive premium.  Give coinbase.com a try.  You can buy bitcoins from your sofa by linking to your bank account.  The downside is it takes a few days for them to arrive.  Probably the fastest way to get them is via bitinstant, using a moneygram, but you pay a 4% fee this way.

EDIT:  A potential future solution to this problem would be something like a smart card holding your private key.
Paper wallet, absolutely.  Any money that you would be placing in your savings account ought to be in a paper wallet.  I'd add that money as 'watch only' in a blockchain.info wallet for convenience and comfort.
Money to be spent I'd also keep for her on an online wallet with dual authentication using SMS.  Frankly I think online wallets with dual authentication is more secure than my mother's online browsing habits of downloading whatever on her PC.
This is a major problem however, and frankly I only see it getting worse.  If/when bitcoin becomes mainstream, all those viruses my wife gets on her laptop won't be as benign as they currently are.  At this point, I trust locked down phones more than PC's, as there are fewer attack vectors for phones.

No they don't at all.  You just have no experience with the reality of financial transactions.  That money cannot be spent until it is cleared, and thus it is actually *not* instant for practical purposes at all.
There is absolutely no reason bitcoin couldn't do the same, and somebody will come along and do this if there is a need.  Bitcoin is not even at version 1.0 yet.  Bitcoin is the *protocol*: the foundation of a global financial system free for everybody to use.  Look at how the internet looked just four years after HTTP was invented (~1995).  It was a mess.  Bitcoin is a foundation upon which others will innovate and solve the current annoyances of the underlying system.

Several other merchants have reported the same trend.  Including bitcoinstore.com, and some other one I can't remember at the moment.  It's not hard to imagine why people spend more bitcoins when the price surges.. they do it for the same reason a lot of people sell their bitcoins when the price surges: Its a way of locking in your profits.  I've been tempted to spend some of my bitcoins to buy that laptop I've been eyeing, now that I've got plenty of extra money I wasn't expecting to have.  
If one believes that the value of bitcoin is going to drop, then you can either sell your bitcoins, or buy goods and services with them.

Bitcoin is far too small and too unstable right now to ever support a nation, anybody who says otherwise is getting ahead of themselves.  The infrastructure isn't there, but it probably will be one day.  I think its far more likely that bitcoin becomes a standard international currency used primarily for internet commerce, while fiat currencies work along side it.  
My interest in it is due to the fact that I can securely and anonymously transact with *anybody in the world* with no/negligable transaction fees, and without going through any kind of middle man like a bank.  I control my money, and I don't need a bank to give me permission to spend it.  It takes power out of the hands of bankers and government and gives it to the common folk.  
Anybody can now sell their services internationally within minutes, and without worrying about fraud.  As it is right now, it would be financial suicide to accept VISA transactions from places like Nigera as fraud is rampant.  With bitcoin you don't need to trust anybody, and you don't need to give them your personal information to transact with them.
Its not perfect, and there will need to be substantial infrastructure built on top of it before it goes mainstream, but I only see that as a matter of time.

Price is set by supply and demand, like every other thing in the entire world.  This is certainly a risk, but not one unique to bitcoin. 


False.  There is not botnet in the world that even comes close to 51% of the power of the bitcoin network, which is roughly 200 times faster than all the words super computers combined.  The bitcoin network does one thing, and one thing only, and that is hashes (with mostly dedicated hardware, ASICS).  General purpose computers are completely worthless at hashing compared to ASICS.  Furthermore, if you do somehow manage to get 51% of the hashing power of the network, then it would be in your best interest to play by the rules, seeing as how you now have a bigger stake in bitcoin than anybody else, and you also recieve the majority of the newly mined bitcoins.  Attempts to double spend are public, would be identified, the value of bitcoin would plummet, and you, the attacker, would lose more than anybody else.  The system is ingenious from a game theory perspective.  


What?  Please elaborate.  Bitcoin is open source.

This is called a Ponzi scheme, and frankly I don't even care that they exist because I see it as a stupid tax.  
I'm almost tempted to say that if you fall for this sort of thing the scammer deserves your money more than you do.

Already happening as much as is possible *in the US*.  But since bitcoin transactions can occur in person at Starbucks, this is absolutely no deterrent.


No, this is not technically possible, and will never happen.  You cannot control or interfere with peer to peer networks in this way.  Just ask the RIAA and the MPAA.  


I'm not a libertarian (though I do share *some* views).  I actually voted for Obama twice in a row.  I believe that governments have an essential role to play in society.  Some smart regulations are needed, others are more detrimental than the problem they are trying to solve.  Power corrupts.  It is a verifiable fact of history regardless of your political views. 


Uh I'm not sure where you get your information, but congress nearly defunded the NSA for abusing their powers several months ago.  The legislation failed by 17 votes in the house.  This was *before* the most damning evidence surfaced by the way.  You must be living in some sort of an echo chamber to be making such a statement.  
Most americans [think the NSA has gone too far](  This view is especially common among redditors, who are mostly liberal by the way.  Just look at the top posts in This view is also held by *[the man who authored the Patriot Act]( giving the NSA these powers in the first place, which is particularly damning.
Furthermore US tech giants [also hold my view](
These are serious problems.  When companies have to defend themselves and their customers against their own governments it makes me wonder what kind of government you envision.  What on earth would possess many of the largest corporations on the planet (almost all competitors) to come together against their own government and label it a threat?


This is voluntary.  I can opt out if I so desire of social networks and cloud services.  The NSA gives me no such option, and monitors us all *without probable cause*.  Which is a direct violation against the [fourth amendment](  
I don't know how one can justifiably hold the position that it is okay that a single entity holds so much power when they have been repeatedly shown to be abusing that power, and the worst part of all this is that they can't even demonstrate that this monstrosity is keeping us safer.  
The amount of money and resources spent on these projects could have built schools and roads, airports and other much needed infrastructure.  These people do not need expansive powers like this to keep us safe.  Their job is to keep us safe while respecting our rights, and I believe that these people are indeed smart enough to do just that.

Cockroaches are also edible, as are meal worms.  Both are a fantastic source of protein, and far more nutritious than corn.  Yet, neither is determined to have any "intrinsic value" because *most* humans do not prefer to eat them, demonstrating as I said earlier, that all value is a creation of the mind, and does not exist outside of the mind which created it.  Value is based in preference, which can easily change.  Post nuclear apocalypse survivors may attribute significant value to cockroaches and meal worms, and shun corn as valueless as it requires too much space and resources to grow.  Value that can instantly change due to external circumstances does not satisfy the conditions of "intrinsic".




This is contradictory by your own definition.  Bitcoins have significant utility.  
There is currently no better way to buy drugs online than with Bitcoin.  To the illicit market goers, Bitcoin has significant utility.  
To gambling websites, Bitcoin has significant utility as it allows them to be provably fair, and greatly simplifies the payout-pay-in process, and it allows players from all over the world to play with little to no effort.  
There is currently no other means by which I can easily conduct micro-transactions over the internet than with Bitcoin.  For me, this has great utility as I like to give people bitcoin tips, and donate micro funds to charities like Seans Outpost.  Not possible without bitcoin.  
To market speculators, Bitcoin has significant utility as it allows them the possibility of massive gains in the short term and the long term.  
There are a many scenarios where Bitcoin has significant utility, and thus by your own definition, Bitcoin has "intrinsic value".

It's a **public** key, so by definition you must assume an attacker knows what it is, as you are supposed to broadcast it to the world.  This is how all public/private cryptography works.  The public key is for reception, while the private key is for encryption and signatures.  
The public key is *not* irrelevant at all, and it does have a very special relationship to the public key.  All security rests in keeping the **private** key private.

False.  That is speculation.  Demand is the stoner who uses bitcoin to feed his addiction.  Demand is the gambler who needs to use bitcoin because his favorite site uses it.  Demand is the worker to needs to send his bitcoins to a foreign country to support his family.  Demand is customer who needs to pay for his internet hosting service, but can't get a paypal account.  By definition, people who buy bitcoin for no other reason than because they forsee it's price rising in the future are speculators, and this is not real demand, as it can vanish as quickly as it comes.  True demand is maintained regardless of future outlook.

But these organizations *don't want to compete*.  They don't want to have to innovate, and spend massive amounts of money to keep up with their competitors.  They want to make money, and by colluding with eachother, or simply buying out the competition removes those pesky market forces that we all love so much.

I don't envision it ever being as stable as most fiat currencies, but that doesn't bother me, as I see bitcoin more as a digital commodity like gold that I can easily spend if I so desire.  People will use bitcoin for things that it is better suited for, like international transactions, micro payments and tips, long term investment, a hedge against inflation and recessions, and any transaction where privacy is very important.  Sure you could use it to buy groceries, but it doesn't excel in that situation as much as it does the others, so I don't expect it to be as popular for those types of things.  Bitcoin doesn't need to be better at everything in order to be successful.

Mining is always about a 10 minute hard problem, regardless of how much computing power is used, as the problem simply adjusts its difficulty to account for the greater computing power.  
Usually, blocks are solved in slightly under 10 minutes on average because the difficulty rate only adjusts once every two weeks, so gains in computing power since the last adjustment result in a slightly lower than 10 minute average.

1) massively inflated the money supply, decreasing the value of each dollar, including yours
2) given everybody but you a portion of the new money, thus taking away your wealth relative to everybody else.  Suddenly all your money is worthless, and everybody but you has an equal share of the new money, so nobody has lost any wealth except for you.  Thus I have the power to give and take wealth as I please. 
As a central bank, I have the power to give and take wealth.

That is a terrible way to do it.  A much better way would be to send bitcoin to BTC China exchange, sell the bitcoin for RMB on that exchange, and him him withdraw the funds that way.  This is the idea behind Ripple, which is pretty cool, except for the fact that its a scam with a pre-mined pointless currency that you are forced to use.

Few people in the world can write a program in a non-memory managed language that listens on an open port that isn't completely riddled with security exploits.  Just ask Dan Kaminsky.  Satoshi's code is bullet proof from a security standpoint.

I know because I work for one of those companies.  This is not something some mathematician accomplishes in his spare time.

The NSA/FBI will almost certainly be able to do *targeted* surveillance of suspects using bitcoin without too much problem.  What they will not be able to do is mass surveillance on the scale that they do with the current financial system.  I see this as a good thing.  
Furthermore, the fact that all transactions are public and can never ever be deleted or altered, will make potential wrong doers a bit weary of using bitcoin as proof of what you have done is permanently hidden in the blockchain, and may be discovered at some point in the future.

Contrary to what many of the overzealous in here might say, bitcoin will have to go through the commodity phase before it can become a currency.  Bitcoin is currently a friction-less digital commodity, like gold.  If it succeeds in this regard, *then* it can become a full fledged currency, but the road from here to there will be a bumpy one.  We need not expect bitcoin to fulfill its full potential immediately, or even in the near future.  
People can be expected to use bitcoin for things that are, or will be, more convenient than alternatives:  micro-transactions, remittances, gambling, international purchases, illicit goods, speculation, store of wealth for those with unstable currencies, and transactions sensitive to privacy (adult industry).  This is where bitcoin shines.  I am not going to use it for most of my day to day purchases, as it's simply too inconvenient, and potentially valuable as we are still in the commodity/speculation phase.  
I may cash out some of my significant profits on goods and services, but when significant profits cease due to price stabilization (it can't go up forever), then so will this class of purchases.  At this point, a new class of purchases may arise due to the stability of the commodity, and a currency can be born.

No personal computer cannot effectively mine bitcoins anymore.  All bitcoin mining is now done on very specialized hardware which costs a significant amount of money to purchase.

This statement right here demonstrates that you don't fully understand bitcoin.  The *only* reason people trust bitcoin at all is because no corporation, government, politician, or group of people controls it.  Would you trust the people of corporation X to honestly maintain a currency and never abuse that power?  Power corrupts, and insiders who have it will eventually abuse it for their own gain.  Just look at Libor, and all the banking scandals of late.  
If there is a single lesson to be learned from the last several thousand years of human civilization, it is that *centralization of power is at odds with human nature.*  It is the sad disposition of nearly all men, that as soon as they get a little power, they immediately begin to exercise unjust dominion.  
As for a bitcoin 2.0, it is not impossible that bitcoin is overtaken by a superior crypto-currency, but that would take a while to happen.  Anybody (literally anybody) can create a crypto-currency, that is easy now.  What is hard, is getting customers to use your currency, getting miners to mine your currency, getting developers to maintain your currency, getting merchants to accept your currency, getting exchanges to trade your currency, and getting the media to report on your currency.  This stuff doesn't happen overnight, and bitcoin has a *very* significant lead.  
Furthermore, nobody would be in a better position to buy this hypothetical superior currency than a bitcoiner.

For the buyer no, for the merchant, very much yes.  Placing the burden of a bad or fraudulent transaction on the merchant is not as desirable as placing it on the buyer.  Not only is it significantly easier for a buyer to commit transaction fraud than a merchant, but buyers have a greater incentive to do it.  In order for merchants to be successful, they have to gain a reputation of quality, trust, and service.  Committing fraud destroys that reputation, and future gains along with it.  Furthermore, buyers can more easily identify honest merchants than merchants can identify honest buyers.  Review systems, experience, and word of mouth give customers easy mechanisms to identify good merchants. 
If you were a merchant would you accept a standard transaction originating from Nigeria?  Hell no, not ever.  A bitcoin transaction?  Hell yes, it doesn't matter, as no trust is required of the buyer.  "Nigerian princes" will never offer payment in Bitcoin.
So bitcoin is superior for merchants in this way, but it is also superior for buyers in a different way, as additional or unsolicited charges can never be made to your account by a merchant.  Golds Gym cannot automatically renew your membership and then make it a pain in the ass to cancel it.  Scumbags. 
TLDR: Game theory says that Buyers are better off handing the burden of fraud than Sellers.

Uh, you clearly don't understand digital currencies *at all*.  Proof of work is the defining distinction between Bitcoin and all other previously failed attempts at a digital currency.  Proof of work is the reason why Bitcoin is the first globally successful digital currency.  Proof of work is what permits bitcoin to be a *distributed* digital currency while also solving the number one problem of all digital currencies, which is the double spending problem.  
Proof of *stake* is a possible alternative, like peercoin, but you'll notice that proof of stake currencies like peercoin are initially bootstrapped by a proof of work phase.  Do not underestimate the importance of proof of work.

If you've come thinking you can simply put your computer to work and get free money, then you will be sorely disappointed unfortunately :( 
Unless you have a rack of very high grade graphics cards lying around that you don't care about, and relatively inexpensive electricity costs, then mining won't be profitable.  In not too long, all mining will be done with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) anyway, so if you really want to get into mining, you'll probably want to order one of those.

You're missing the other end of this argument, which is that Fiat currencies have a tendency to encourage debt, which is also bad.  The Dollar was pegged to a finite supply of Gold up until 1971, and the idea that this model is 'detrimental' is demonstrably silly, as countries managed it just fine for hundreds of years.  
Also, the fact that the supply of bitcoin is limited **is built into current the market price** of bitcoin.  This does not guarantee that bitcoins will be worth more in the future, because the market will have built any estimated future gains of the currency into the **current** price.  So its future price depends, like all other stocks and speculations, on how accurate those estimations are.  This is why Microsoft can announce record losses, and yet their stock price goes up drastically.. The record losses were already built into the price and assumed to occur, but they weren't as bad as people thought they would be, so the price ends up increasing.  Or why Apple can report record profits, and yet their stock price drops.
People will not hoard bitcoin because they will have no idea if the price will go up or down long term. **A guaranteed limited supply does not guarantee a continued rise in the future price.**

The value of bitcoin has gone up significantly in the last few years/months/weeks, but this is absolutely no guarantee that prices will continue to rise.  Do not spend any money on bitcoin you are not willing to lose.  Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and while I believe it will ultimately succeed, there are many ways that it could ultimately fail.  Tread forward with caution, and never ever dump money into something you don't fully understand, including bitcoin.  If you decide to get into bitcoin, you need to know what you are getting into.  I suggest you read the bitcoin white paper if you are even a little bit tech savy.  Give it a try regardless:

Because when there is a dispute between buyer and seller, Paypall requires the buyer to prove that they sent the money (which they should have record of), and the seller to prove that they sent the item, which they don't have access to so they ask the seller to prove that it was shipped.  If the seller can prove that the item shipped (via providing shipping records), then Paypall sides with the seller, and the seller keeps the money.  If the seller cannot prove that the item shipped, then they side with the buyer, and refund the money.  
Paypal's current protocol doesn't handle digital goods, since they are not 'shipped' in the traditional sense.  So all charge-backs will by protocol side with the buyer since the bitcoin seller cannot prove that they 'shipped' the goods.  It could probably be modified to handle the case of digital goods (checking the blockchain etc), but as of right now it doesn't.  You have to ship something in order to not get screwed over by a charge-back. 
This is also why you should *never* sell somebody goods face-to-face via Paypall.  They can do a charge-back and get their money back afterwards since you will not be able to prove that you shipped it to them as it was done face to face..  They will side with the buyer, and refund the money to them.

Bitcoin is a commodity you can spend and transfer anywhere in the world, not a currency in the modern sense like dollars or euros.  Bitcoin is like digital gold, and like gold, the vast majority of its value stems from speculation.  When the price of bitcoin is discovered with more certainty, it won't be nearly as volatile and at that point bitcoin can function more efficiently as a currency.

Lets not be naive, bitcoin was definitely over-valued at $260 at that time, as speculators bought it simply because they believed other people would buy it, possibly without even knowing or caring what bitcoin is.  This doesn't de-legitimize bitcoin in any way, as it can and does happen with legitimize things all the time.  It wasn't the first bubble, and it won't be the last.  Things like bitcoin that have *massive disruptive potential* are prime targets for speculators and desperate folks trying to get rich quick.  Acting like bitcoin is worthy of every price it reaches is a little naive I think.  It will get there eventually, but it will take time and additional infrastructure.

Paul Krugman, widely regarded as a sane economist, said it pretty much exactly...
Yeah, Bitcoin is simply not going to subvert the dollar or fiat currencies, despite what some of the overzealous in here might think.  It will be used for internet and international purchases, because this is where it shines, and probably as a store of value for those who don't have access to a stable currency, and some who do.  The fact that its deflationary doesn't matter as no economy is going to be built upon it and it alone.  Bitcoin can be wildly successful simply doing what it is good at.  It doesn't need to be the end-all be all of currencies in order to succeed.

Wrong, there are several things, Have you read satoshi's published paper?  Have you read his comments on the forums?  The paper was not written by some random Joe with a decent idea.  It was written by a guy who was obviously familiar with the standard process of publishing research papers, as it's a generic PHD research paper.  Which you would immediately recognize if you had ready any. The author was demonstrably very educated and following standard protocol for research papers.  I'm not trying to portray Satoshi as some kind of super human or hero, as there are hundreds of folks in the crypto computer science world who could have written that paper, but whoever did write it, was clearly very comfortable with the process, and the evidence is in favor of the author being a researcher than some random 'hacker'.

The price will not settle for any prolonged period of time due to the disruptive nature of Bitcoin, its potential, and the fact that most countries in the world have yet to take a prolonged stance on Bitcoin yet.  Bitcoin won't become stable for a while after all the regulatory fog clears, and the infrastructure is stable enough that exchanges are not getting hacked every month.
Once the price does finally settle, then at that moment, bitcoin can begin its transition into a currency, backed up by the commodity that it currently is.  That will be the singularity moment for Bitcoin, as there will be massive incentives to enter the Bitcoin ecosystem, and few or no incentives to leave.

You cannot even begin to fully understand bitcoin unless you have a fairly in-depth understanding of:
1: Peer to Peer distributed networks
2: Public/Private key cryptography
3: Sha-256 Hashes
4: The distributed consensus problem
5: Open source software, and its implications
Without understanding any of these concepts, you cannot understand why anybody would put any trust in bitcoin at all.  You simply cannot fathom how it is different from anything else that has come before, and why you can trust that bitcoins cannot be counterfeited, and why you can trust in the algorithms. 
Tulips have no utility value.  They don't let people solve problems that couldn't be solved without them.  Bitcoin enables micro-transactions, it enables cheap, seemless, international transactions , it doesn't require that a buyer divulge sensitive information to make a purchase, and the seller has no fear of charge-backs.  It also enables people to purchase goods and services like drugs online, which many argue may be a bad thing, but it is a strong utility of bitcoin.

Money is worthless if you don't have information, training, communication, and organization.  The internet provides all these things to Terrorists.  Please justify the existence of the internet which is responsible for enabling terrorists more than any other technology in existence, along with cell phones.
Furthermore, terrorism is statistically one of the least dangerous things facing Americans.  You are more likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist, or even falling off of a ladder.  You are significantly more likely to be killed driving to work, or crossing the street.  Terrorism isn't statistically a threat, it is an emotional threat which has been abused by politicians to expand their powers, and it was worked wonderfully.  
If we want to be safer from terrorism, *we need to change our foreign policy*, which is the cause of this animosity.  If a foreign power had spent decades meddling in American affairs, enabling our enemies, and causing wars, we'd have just as much animosity towards them as they do towards us.  Terrorism is a problem created by what so many believe to be "the solution", which is interventionism.

Try making a meaningful transaction, especially international, or interbank transaction.  Merchants get charged 2-5% for credit card transactions (Granted, this is not a bank issue)


This is an exchange issue, not a bitcoin issue.  I have .25 cents in my bitcoin tip account.  These two things are not comparable, and even if they were, the exchanges minimum purchase is far far less than a minimum amount for a savings account at a bank.  


False.  Banks deny customers all the time, just ask many of the bitcoin start-ups.  There is no law preventing banks from giving bitcoin companies bank accounts, and yet they are denied.  Furthermore, there are billions of people in the world who unbanked, or underbanked.  Banks fault or not, bitcoin doesn't have these problems.  Nobody cares who's fault it is.


It is not correct to equate distributed permission with centralized permission.  Centralized power is significantly more likely to be abused than distributed power, which must come to a consensus.  Furthermore, freezing a bitcoin account is only possible in theory, and will likely never happen, as it is unlikely that 50% of the network would agree to such a thing as it would be detrimental to everything the currency stands for, decreasing the trust of the system, and hence its value.  Who would stand to lose the most in this scenario?  The &gt;50% of the network who approved it.  Game theory says this scenario is highly unlikely. 


Again, this is a sad attempt to equate distributed power with centralized power.  Denying a transaction would destroy trust in the currency.  Not going to happen. 
You're arguments are reminiscent of those who criticized email in its early days, or the internet.  Bitcoin has significant advantages, and some disadvantages yes, but ignoring the inefficiencies of the current banking system makes me wonder if you are a banker.

I also use coinbase.  Its the easiest, but takes 4-5 days after ordering to receive your bitcoin.  Fee's are 1%, price is locked in when you purchase.  
Another option, if you want very fast bitcoins (15-20 minutes) is bitinstant via moneygram at a CVS or 7-eleven.   bitinstant takes a 4% fee with moneygram taking a $3.95 fee on top of that.

So why wouldn't a user simply open up thousands of accounts with the minimum amount of 'tencoin', then just wait for redistribution to fill his accounts.  Rinse and repeat.  This model isn't sound from a Game Theoretical standpoint.

I find mass surveillance to be quite dangerous :)  Governments shouldn't have the ability to block payments to thepiratebay, or wikileaks, or to Edward Snowden.  Governments frequently abuse these powers to curtail political opposition parties, or democracy in general.  In fact, the number one tool that allows for the entire dark web to exist (TOR) was created by a US navy research team to empower democratic opposition parties within oppressive regimes.  This is the technology that allows for internet black markets to exist.  Bitcoin has nearly identical powers, which makes some wonder if it was created by the same people.  It can literally empower the oppressed,  and be a global force for democracy and freedom.  (End rant)


Absolutely.  First of all, bitcoin is a global currency, so US controls have no effect outside the US.  There are countries that currently have absolutely no restrictions on Bitcoin transactions.  US laws cannot change this.  
Second, localbitcoins.com is a site that people can use to facilitate person to person transactions with cash or bank deposits.  This kind of transaction is off the grid.  
Third, as bitcoin goes mainstream, there is less and less of a need to convert it to dollars.  Why bother converting when what you want is for sale in Bitcoin?  This is becoming more and more of a reality every day.

It's clear that Satoshi was a member of the [cypherpunks]( based on his forum posts.  Guys like that don't typically gravitate towards government careers.  As it stands right now, bitcoin is probably the biggest threat to the American government in existence.  Without the dollar as the worlds reserve currency, the US will tumble into chaos.  It just doesn't make sense for a government agency to create such a thing.  Furthermore, why must Satoshi be an American?

You didn't address his argument, which is that pretty much all of modern economics is pyramid like in nature. This isn't necessarily a bad thing so long as population growth never stops, and resources never run out.  The sad reality is that resources are indeed finite, and current world population growth estimates predict that the world will reach a max population of around 11 billion around the year 2050, and proceed to *decline* from then on, assuming current birth rate trends continue.  In a deflationary world population, a deflationary currency would be well suited in the same way an inflationary currency can be well suited for an inflationary world population.

Why?  This has already been debated 1000 times already.  The only people who liken Bitcoin to tulips have literally no idea how the technology works, nor are they aware of what Bitcoin allows people to do that they cannot do with any other technology.  
The price of bitcoin due to speculation is the *least* interesting thing about it.  The technology breakthrough that provided a solution to the once thought to be practically impossible distributed consensus problem, and the ramifications of a technology that allow people to literally be their own bank are just a *few* of the more interesting things about bitcoin.

If you are concerned about buying at the wrong time, then simply divide your purchase into many smaller purchases over a longer period of time.  This is called dollar cost averaging and is designed to minimize the risk associated with buying a volatile commodity.  This lowers both your potential losses and gains, so be aware.  So long as bitcoin continues to rise however, you'll make plenty of gains.
If you ask me, I think the market is due for a correction, and that you're best bet is to buy in 2-3 months when the hype dies down like it has in the past, but the price could very well go to $700+ or more before that happens, and $400 may end up being a good price to have bought at.  Bottom line is that nobody knows, and anybody who thinks they do know is lying.

as quickly as possible, use bitinstant via money gram.  You can have the bitcoins in minutes.  You pay 4% fee's to bitinstant, and a $3.95 fee to monegram, so be aware of that.

You'll probably want to do so on an exchange, unless you can find somebody on localbitcoins.com willing to do it, though my suspicion is that they'd just buy them from an exchange and then charge you extra, so may as well do it yourself.  Plus, its far more risky doing it in person.

The problem with the 51% attack is that if you actually have the power to pull it off, its in your best interest *not to do it*.  Why destroy something that you have invested massive amounts of money and resources into, and that provides a steady stream of income?  Attacking it would destroy your steady stream of income, and any transactions you were able to reverse would cause the value of the bitcoins you just stole to drop to probably nothing as everybody pulls out.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:23:16
I wouldn't say supply and demand has nothing to do with the price, I would say that the *current* supply and demand has little to do with the price, as the vast majority of the value of bitcoin comes from speculation about its possible future value due to the restricted supply.  But yes, you are correct, and the circle jerkers who downvote you are blinded by their zealousness
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:45:09
It's probably because of the blockchain, which makes all transactions open and public.  This will allow targeted surveillance as the NSA/FBI can monitor money of *targeted* individuals more easily in many regards.  
Bitcoin makes broad sweeping monitoring probably more difficult, but targeted monitoring in conjunction with hacking/wiretaps will give law enforcement a lot of power.

@_date: 2013-05-11 06:16:11
I agree, but voluntary redistribution is *very* different from forced redistribution, which is what Tencoin is.  You cannot build a system that is dependent upon altruism for success, and attempting to force altruism will also fail.  
Voluntary redistribution I think is a great thing, and systems can provide good incentives to do so, like tax breaks in the US, but forcing it has a discouraging effect on individuals to try and be successful.  There's nothing wrong with a system having some very wealthy individuals, so long as the wealthy individuals play by the same rules as everybody else.  We often see that the most wealthy or powerful have rigged the system in their favor, squashing out potential competition and cementing their status at the top.  This is what the system needs to prevent, not the very existence of wealthy individuals.

I just keep my paper wallets in a small fire-safe I have in my house.  Plus I keep a digital backup on an encrypted USB stick.  Yes you can continually add new BTC to a new paper wallet.  What I like to do is add my paper wallet public addresses as "watch only" addresses in blockchain.info.  That way you can always verify how much money you have, and in the worse case that somebody hacks blockchain.info, then it doesn't matter because they are only watch addresses.  If you want to spend the bitcoin, you can then simply import the private key and you're good to go.

Once bitcoin prices stabalize, then at that point in time bitcoins primary role as a speculative commodity will end, and its role as a stable currency will begin.  Nobody will need to immediately convert to fiat when accepting bitcoin at that time.  Bitcoin will have its own economy of individuals who are paid in bitcoin, and buy and sell goods in bitcoin.  
The current commodity phase of bitcoin will drive people into it seeking profits, and the future stable period of bitcoin will allow it to flourish as an actual independent international currency.
Ultimately bitcoin can succeed as either commodity or currency, but in order to become a currency, it will have to outgrow its speculative commodity phase.
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:38:25
Are you really so certain that BTC will be worth more tomorrow?  Is there a guarantee?  You need to understand that claiming that bitcoin is almost certainly going to be worth more tomorrow is identical to claiming bitcoin is undervalued.  And if you truly believe that bitcoin is undervalued, then you ought to be buying more of it, that is the only rational decision.  If you follow this very basic logic, you will see that the price of bitcoin is absolutely NOT guaranteed to increase forever.  It will reach a maximum and eventually stabilize.  Only then can bitcoin make the transition from primarily a commodity, to primarily a currency.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:45:41

I'm by no means a gold bug, never owned gold before, but I can see why some people like the idea behind it.  
The difference between fiat currencies and hard currencies, as I see it, is a matter of trade-offs.  Fiat currencies are more efficient, while hard currencies are more resistant to corruption. 
Fiat currencies give enormous power to the central bank to control not only the supply of money, but its distribution as well.  Central banks have the power to give and take wealth as they please.  Now, in the right hands, this power can certainly do a lot of good to society in general, but likewise, in the wrong hands, it can do much evil.  Those in favor of fiat currencies generally cite its benefits, while those against them cite the evils. 
Claiming one is better than the other is a silly idea in my mind, because like nearly all things, there are inherent trade-offs.
Furthermore, it is far to early to claim there will be no financial disaster.  Many who predicted the 2008 collapse, and were ignored, are also predicting another one.  There has been massive massive money printing by the Fed, but there has been very little inflation simply because that money has not yet entered into circulation, but rest assured, it will eventually.

Because anybody who's been through a few of these pump/dump stages if expecting bitcoin to hit a low.

I hate to burst so many bubbles in here, but bitcoin is not going to replace government currencies, nor does it even need to to be successful.

It will be used where its more convenient, and avoided where its  not, its as simple as that.

If you're really lucky any other investment could make that in a year or a few years.  Expecting more than that any time soon is pure idiocy and greed.

@_date: 2013-12-04 05:58:27
Let me give an example.  In the last few years, the price of natural gas has dropped significantly, despite the fact that supply has hardly increased, and demand hasn't changed much either.  So why the massive drop in price?  The reason for this is because new technology has been invented which allows oil companies to extract significantly more natural gas from the earth.  The price dropped because most of the price of natural gas is speculation, and with this new knowledge, speculators *expect* a massive influx in supply in the future, not because one has actually occurred yet. And when it *does* occur, then in theory the price won't change much because this fact has already been accounted for in the price.  
The price of a highly speculated commodity doesn't reflect its immediate supply and demand, but its *future expected* supply and demand.  Prices are mostly stable when supply and demand meet projected expectations, and go up or down because of *unexpected* changes in the current or future supply and demand.  This is why Apple can report its greatest profits in the history of the company, and yet its shares lose value... speculators were *expecting even greater profits*, and Apple getting even greater record profits than they got was already factored into the price when the profits were reported.
Price reflects expectations.  Bitcoin prices have gone up because projections for future bitcoin demand are significantly greater than previous expectations.  When bitcoin demand is following its expected projections (which is increasing at some expected rate), its price will be relatively stable because that increase in demand is expected and already accounted for in the price.  If projected demand is still increasing, but not at the expected rate, then the price of bitcoin will *fall, despite increases in demand*, because demand is not increasing at the expected rate.

Decentralized crypto-currencies like bitcoin *cannot* be regulated practically or technologically except at the exchanges.  Governments can and probably will regulate the entry points to the bitcoin network, but what you do after while inside the network is not regulatable without re-structuring and re-building the entire internet.

I am in no way qualified to answer this question, and probably nobody is for that matter, but people do tend to gravitate toward stable money stores during times of recessions.  Bitcoin isn't exactly known for stability, but despite this, I suspect that people would indeed purchase bitcoin during a monetary catastrophe simply because bitcoin represents the exact opposite of what would have caused the disaster.  I'm guessing we'd see a massive spike like we've never seen before (which is saying a lot for bitcoin), followed by an eventual massive crash as people (like us relatively early adopters) lock in their insane profits.

When you're managing servers and such, people are obviously going to buy hardware with full linux support, but laptop owners who want to use linux as a consumer OS don't have that luxury most of the time.

I used coinbase, and just gave them my bank account login information so that they could instantly verify it.  After verification, I just went and changed my bank account password.  
If you don't want to do coinbase, then you can try bitinstant via moneygram, but Fee's are a lot more that way.  Bitinstant takes 4%, and moneygram is $3.95.  The nice thing about bitinstant is that you can literally have the bitcoins in a few minutes.  Coinbase takes a bit longer to actually get the bitcoins, but only charge a 1% fee, which is very nice.

True, but the onus of trust is better carried by the merchants than the consumers, as merchants have a significantly stronger incentive to be honest than do consumers.  Merchants have an incentive to maintain a reputation of trust, as they have a lot to lose if they don't.  Consumers don't have this incentive, and the current system requires that merchants have some level of trust of their customers, which is an objectively inferior solution according to game theory.

The reason bitcoin is the most popular is because all other digital currencies currently in existence are all derivatives of bitcoin.  Some, like litecoin, are basically clones of bitcoin with some minor tweeks.  Anybody can take the bitcoin source code, copy it, make some minor changes, and boom you've got your own currency.  Unless one of its derivatives solves some major problem in bitcoin that the bitcoin developers somehow refuse to address, then bitcoin will remain dominant.

Terrorists also heavily use the internet, smart phones, fertilizer, crock pots, guns, Twitter, e-mail, box cutters, unbreakable encryption, laptops, and pretty much all the things that normal people use.  The fact that a tool can be used for evil is meaningless, and in no way unique.  What is important is how much good can be done with a tool relative to how much evil can be done with it.
This is evident especially with the internet, where pedophiles run rampant and terrorists learn how to make bombs and recruit new members.  Why does nobody suggest that we shut down the internet?  Because the internet has in and of itself done far more good than it has evil.  The free flow of information is almost universally recognized as a net good to humanity.  The free flow of money will likewise be a net good.
Will Bitcoin enable terrorists?  Possibly yes, just like every single other technology which has enabled the rest of humanity.  The benefits it provides to the oppressed, and the power it takes away from the corrupt will far outweigh the evil that will come from it.

You *STILL* haven't answered my question.  **What will stop these companies from forming monopolies or colluding together?**  
NOTHING.  Government assistance is not at all required to gain a monopoly, and if you think it can't be done without government help you're fooling yourself.  Government is more of a hindrance to monopolies than it is a helper, but it can easily be done without any government at all, and then you have nobody to stop it.  It is the inevitable end state of a Free Market with no rules.  Even Adam Smith the father of Free markets believed this.  Its basic mathematical Game Theory.
Yes, sometimes governments *do* aid in the creation of these monopolies, but monopolies can and do form without any government assistance at all.  And when they do, they only remain monopolies if the government agree's to it, but the point being that the government has the ability to shut it down.  Without a government, the monopolies would become so powerful as to become a de-facto government in and of themselves, with no accountability to the people.

Lets look at the *corollary* to that argument:  
*If dollars are constantly decreasing in value due to inflation, then why would a merchant ever sell anything today when they could sell it for more tomorrow?  Won't inflation cause merchants to hoard their goods and services?*
Furthermore, why would I ever spend $800 on a new computer when I could invest that money in the stock markets, and earn on average 10% interest per year on it?
The point is, that people buy things when they need them or want them, and people generally value *now* more than they value the future.
Modest inflation/deflation is perfectly manageable. Extreme inflation/deflation does indeed cause problems, but bitcoin has this unique feature that no other currency has... its also a commodity, and deflation is great for commodities.
Since bitcoin is a currency, payment system, and commodity all rolled into one, it only needs succeed in a single of these areas to be successful, and yet any success in one area greatly increases the likelyhood of success in another.

It has nothing to do with labeling others or yourself, it has to do with *communicating a message* to others.  When you use a word to label yourself, people will associate **their definition of that word** with you, not your definition of that word.  You can happily call yourself a hacker, which is fine, especially when speaking with others who have a similar definition of the word as you do, but when you are speaking with others who in a sense speak a different language (having different definitions for some words) *you need to speak their language if you wish to communicate with them properly*, otherwise they will misunderstand the message you are trying to convey.  
Proper communication cannot occur unless there are agreed upon definitions for the words that are said.  In this case, most people have a very negative association with the word 'hacker', so using that word will convey that meaning to those people.

I never said it was.  You missed my point, which is that the idea that people *will hoard money and not spend it simply because it will be worth more in the future is demonstrably wrong*.  If that logic were true, then everybody would be investing in the stock market instead of spending their excess dollars.
Yes of course if you can't buy the things you want with bitcoin, people will cash out, but that is a separate issue, unrelated to deflation.  Every day more and more merchants are accepting bitcoin.  Furthermore, bitcoin is *far easier* to spend than any other currency, assuming you can find what you want, which is less of a problem every day.  I think its fair to say that if given the option, most people will choose to purchase in bitcoins due to its simplicity and privacy, as well as avoiding transaction fees and the hassle of exchanging it for another currency.

If you want long term storage, just use a paper wallet(s).  Dirt simple, immune from hacking.  I keep investment BTC in paper wallets, and spending BTC in coinbase or blockchain, that way my spending money is highly convenient, easy to use, and a bit less secure, while my saving money is highly inconvenient, but very secure, just the way you want it.  Furthermore, its nice to add your paper wallets as "watch only" addresses on blockchain, that way you get the nice and cozy feeling of seeing all your money, but in the worst case scenario where your account is somehow hacked, they can't access the "watch only" addresses.

This isn't true either, because only a fraction of the bitcoin's price is actually reflected by its economic value and use, the vast majority is speculation.

We all know why, of course... speculation is the primary driver of bitcoin price, not the BTC economy. 
It is certainly possible that the bitcoin economy grows slowly, and speculators flee at the same time, driving the price down.  I'm not predicting this will happen, but its certainly possible given the fact that the vast majority of bitcoin's current value is speculation, and speculators are not bound by rationality.

You guys are looking at Ripple all wrong.  Ripple is not a currency, nor will it compete with bitcoin.  Ripple is **exactly what bitcoin needs right now: a distributed exchange**.  Exchanges are bitcoins weakest link, and the first place governments will look to regulate.  Ripple will let people exchange bitcoin in a completely decentralized fashion, and make bitcoin more accessible.
Everybody is always complaining about mtgox all the time.  Well, here is your solution.

It might go up drastically if suddenly some major company starts accepting it, or it might go down drastically if governments start shutting down exchanges like mtgox.  Nobody knows what will happen, so don't buy any bitcoins unless you can financially handle losing them all.  Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme.  That said, I would start out small with maybe $50 or $100 dollars worth to get your feet wet, then continue from there if you want.  I also wouldn't mess with exchanges at this point either.  Either buy from somebody on localbitcoins.com with cash, or possibly see if you can use bitinstant with a debit card (not sure if there are age limits...)

This is beyond idiotic.  
Wild fluctuations in price have been standard since the beginning, not just now.  Definitely not indicative of anything.
Price drop of 40% has also happened at least 4 times before, so certainly nothing out of the ordinary here, nor is it indicative of anything but earlier investors locking in massive profits, which is perfectly rational. 
Exchanges have also been shutdown in the past, but you'll notice that the rate of new exchanges is outpacing the rate of dying exchanges.  Survival of the fittest at work here.

I'm with Jeff Garzik on this one.. I don't think bitcoin would be particularly well suited as the basis for a national economy, nor does it need to be for it to be successful.  
If bitcoin were only ever used for e-commerce, international commerce, micro-transactions and transactions that benefit from some level of privacy, then it will be a huge success.  The future isn't going to be all bitcoin or all fiat, it will involve a slew of crypto-currencies working along side fiat competing with each-other.  
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:04:07
Then use Western Union, converting your bitcoin to fiat is just an extra step to a process with already too many steps. Yes, Ripple works with any currency, but it uses a debt system to give the appearance of instant transfers, when in reality they are not.  
If the system was built on top of Bitcoin, using it as the transportation layer, then there would be no debt or trust like is currently requited in Ripple.  It's a thousand times more complicated than bitcoin, which is saying a lot considering the complexity of bitcoin.

Its the spread difference between the 'asks' and the 'bids'.  Imagine a bunch of people get together in one room to buy/sell cookies.  The buyers move to one side, and the sellers move to the other.  Buyers are asked what they are willing to pay, and sellers are asked what they are willing to sell for.  Buyers are sorted by highest price to lowest, sellers are sorted by lowest price to highest.  The difference between the highest buyer, and the lowest seller is that gap.

For some problems this is certainly true, but there are other problems (Like integer factorization) which already have [Polynomial time algorithms]( available for quantum computers.  Integer factorization on standard computers *is not* something that is made easy by parallelization, if it were, then a lot of standard crypto systems would be broken, as they depend upon its difficulty.
Parallization doesn't change the algorithmic complexity of the problem.  Most AI algorithms right now depend highly upon heuristics, as the search space is simply too massive to search exhaustively.  In some cases, Quantum Computers can actually do an exhaustive search that would not be feasible for standard computers, regardless of parallelization.  
The Traveling salesman is another example where Quantum Computers can shine.  Current algorithms to solve this are all heuristic in nature for any reasonable size N.  
If Quantum Computing takes off, I foresee great advancements in Speech recognition, NLP, Search, optimization problems, Protein folding (biology), and who knows what else.  I'm not saying this will lead to a singularity however, as I'm quite skeptical of such an event.

A paper wallet is just a public/private key pair (you can generate them on bitaddress.org).  You send bitcoin to the public key address, and you're done.  The bitcoins do not reside on any online wallet service (like armory) unless you want to import them at a later time.  The point of paper wallets is that they are perfectly safe and cannot be hacked.  If you plan on saving your bitcoins, they are ideal.  If you plan on spending them, then import them into a wallet.

Bitcoin has a public ledger of every transaction that has ever occurred.  Anybody can look at it [in real time](
This does provide *some* tools to law enforcement, but since there are no identities attached to transactions, it is difficult to track unless you have a lot of external metadata that you can use to make sense of it all.  Bitcoin is not as anonymous as many people think, and I have no doubt that the NSA already has tools in place to analyze the blockchain in association with all the other data they collect.  
There are many efforts to thwart this kind of analysis though, so in the end, bitcoin will probably win the privacy war.

I think bitcoin replacing government fiat currencies is a pipe dream personally.  E-books haven't replaced books, Netflix hasn't replaced theaters, and the internet hasn't replaced libraries.  Bitcoin simply won't replace fiat currencies either, and I'll be willing to bet my entire horde of 7 bitcoins on that. Bitcoin will work along side fiat and be used in those situations where it is superior and more convenient, and not in those situations where it is less convenient than fiat.
Governments are not going to just give up their control over their currencies, and frankly I don't think they should.  Bitcoin can have a strong impact on Governments and Banks without replacing fiat currencies, simply through competition.  Governments will be reluctant to debase their currencies if they know their citizens can easily jump ship onto a digital currency like bitcoin that is a better store of wealth.  Competition will drastically alter monetary policy, which is currently a monopolistic system.

What do you mean by 'monopolized'.  Can somebody own the majority of all bitcoins?  Sure, its possible, Satoshi owns about 10% of them, but at this point, in order to buy a huge stake of bitcoin would require an absurd amount of money.  The more you buy, the more the price rises.

I disagree.  Bitcoin can be a resounding success without brick and mortar shops accepting it at all.

Sure, people can use it that way if they want, but that is not where it shines, and its greatest success will come from where it shines.. international and internet purchases.  If internet retailers all accept bitcoin, but no brick and mortar ones do, bitcoin will still be a resounding success.

bitinstant will get you bitcoins in your wallet very quickly, within 10-15 minutes after sending the money to zipzap via moneygram at a CVS or 7-eleven or something similar. Fee's are 4% for bitinstant, with a $3.95 transaction fee for moneygram however. 
Coinbase you can link to your bank account, and buy bitcoins at whatever the price is right now, but you won't get them for like 4-5 days.  The nice thing about this though is that there is only a 1% fee, and you can do it from your couch.

Agreed, and one thing that people are not mentioning in this whole debate is that bitcoin does actually have intrinsic value in that it solves problems that no other currency can currently solve.  There is a need for it in specific circumstances.  Internet services is a great example.  Web Hosting companies can sell their internet services to anybody in the world, at any time, without a middle man, and without fear of a charge back.  Not everybody has access to the Dollar, and not everybody can create a pay pal account, or get a debit/credit card. This **is** an intrinsic value:  The fact that there is no other convenient way to do this, and people want to do it.

Meh, I don't really blame people for being worried or skeptical about bitcoin, as its price *does* follow the pattern of past bubbles.

The role of government in my view should be:
1. The physical protection of its citizens against foreign or local powers. 
2. Authority by which citizens can resolve disputes
3. Force to keep the markets competitive.  
When left to their own devices, unregulated markets will always devolve into collusion and monopolies.  Governments job should be to prevent this from occurring by ensuring that competition in the marketplace is strong, and that incumbents have not rigged the system in their favor, preventing challengers.  
Unfortunately, governments have a history of sometimes doing the opposite, which is enabling monopolies and collusion via lobbying efforts.

This doesn't seem to me like a very good reason to justify regulations of an entire industry.  3 guys wiring 100k?  Have you heard of HSBC?  One of the largest banks in the world which laundered billions of Mexican drug cartel money, and when they got caught, not a single person went to jail.  And this is coming from a *highly regulated* industry.  Evil will find a way regardless of regulations.  People can be bought or collude together.


This is not possible, either technically or practically for a number of reasons.  First, bitcoin is not a US phenomena, it is a global phenomena and people can buy and sell it anywhere, including the streets.  you cannot regulate that any more than you can regulate cash transactions. 
Second, bitcoin cannot be technically controlled or regulated within itself without literally dismantling the internet.  Not even its creator can control it.  Governments can, and mostly do, regulate the points of entry and exit into bitcoin, but what happens within bitcoin cannot be regulated.  
US citizens have constitutional rights to privacy, and blanket surveillance and monitoring (including financial transactions) is the most dangerous and insidious threat to freedom that Americans currently face.  
I work for a large tech company that the NSA has literally illegally hacked to gain access to their internal cloud networks.  Microsoft has [labeled the US government]( "a persistent threat". If there is one lesson that has been learned from thousands of years of human civilization, it is that it is the sad nature and disposition of nearly all men, that as soon as they are granted some power, they almost immediately begin to exercise unjust dominion.  
Power is easily granted to governments, but very hard to revoke, as the same power which was given can often times be abused to maintain it.  Imagine what kind of blackmail threat an organization could be that can literally tap the phone line of the president, 
We need not sacrifice our privacy and our freedom for security, especially for statistically insignificant threats.  If there are individuals who are suspected of being terrorists, then with warrants their computers can be hacked and their bitcoins likely monitored.  Targeted surveillance is perfectly within reason, and highly effective, but *blanket monitoring of all of society is a power to great to entrust to any organization or human*. If we want to be safe from terrorism, then attack the root cause, not the symptoms.

The problem with Ripple is:
1. It can easily be shut down by regulators.  It's more like Napster, while bitcoin is more like BitTorrent.  If Bitcoin is going to have regulatory issues, then Ripple will have them times 100.
2. Circulation of XRP's is in the hands of the company, so they can inflate the currency however they wish.  This means the value of XRP's is uncertain and in the hands of a very few people who have a board of directors and investors expecting to make money from their investments.  I know exactly how many bitcoin will be in circulation at any given time, and that its price is determined by the free-market, which I prefer despite the volatility because its honest and fair (as fair as can be anyway)
Aside from these, I find using Ripple to be pretty cool, and if it works I think it will give bitcoin a boost, as it will allow people to exchange it more easily.  I don't see XRP's replacing bitcoin however.  I value my bitcoin because I know how rare they currently are, and how rare they will be in the future.  With Ripple, I know nothing.

You have to realize that all the other alternate coins are essentially just clones of bitcoin.  They offer very little that is new or innovative, many of them are objectively worse than bitcoin.  Some people think Alt coins are dangerous to bitcoin, but personally I think they actually make it stronger because all the competition is drowned out by an endless sea of copies and clones.  Alt coins have more in common with eachother than they do bitcoin, which sets bitcoin apart significantly.

It's not impossible that something objectively better comes along, and if it did, I'd fully support it.  But I think of it this way.  Who will be the first to recognize the fact that a new currency is better?  Probably bitcoin users.  Who will be in a great positition to actually purchase a potentially new and better digital currency?  Why, bitcoin holders of course.  The reason its a pain in the ass to buy bitcoin is because we don't have bitcoin to buy it with, we have to use our national fiat currencies which make it hard.

So in simple terms **extrinsic value = (market price) - (intrinsic value)**

It's relatively stable now because you're used to the insane volatility that comes when a bubble is created and pops.

Inflation occurs when the supply of money increases, causing the price of goods and services to also increase, since everybody now has more money, money is less scarce.  If the supply of bitcoins decreases due to loss/etc then each bitcoin is now worth more than it was before, therefore the price of goods and services will *decrease*.
Think of it like this, I give you 10 unobtainum rocks and say that these are the only 10 unobtanium rocks in existence, and this collection is valued at 1 million dollars.  The next day you accidentally destroy one, so now there are only 9 in existence, but this collection is still valued at 1 million dollars since these are the only unobtanium rocks in existence, so each unobtainum rock is now worth more than it was before.

It is definitely problematic, but not detrimental.  Those who are concerned with the volatility can instantly turn their bitcoin into dollars as soon as the transaction is complete via companies like bitpay.

Uh... Really really stupid idea.

This is only a temporary problem.  A fix for this is currently in the works.  Furthermore, transaction fee's are technically optional in bitcoin, depending on the client you use.


False, ask any retailer how "instant" credit cards are.  They appear instant, but the fact is they can be, and frequently are, reversed.  The transaction itself takes anywhere from 6 to 24 hours to actually "clear".  Confirmations are not required except for very large purchases, as double-spend attempts can be detected.  A "pending" bitcoin transaction is safer than a standard "instant" credit card transaction.  Merchants simply assume the risk of the credit card transaction reversed for the beneficial appearance of "instant". 
The whole point of bitcoin is an *internet* money, where none of your concerns matter.  That is where its strengths are.

To answer your question, bitcoin is down because of all the news talking about the U.S. considering regulating it.  Bitcoin price is driven by two forces:
1. Adoption by major companies or websites causes its price to rise, as do political events that cause people to lose trust in the current banking system, 
2. Mention of potential regulations, exchange shutdowns, or in some cases DDOS attacks cause the price to go down.

Buying bitcoins with credit cards or paypal sounds great on the surface, but to anybody who knows how those systems actually work its simply not feasible or desirable to do so because both of those systems are built upon the charge-back model, and bitcoin is not (for good reason).  Any bitcoin seller that accepts paypall or credit cards will instantly get screwed because as soon as the bitcoins arrive in the buyers wallet, a charge-back will occur, and the buyer has just stolen the sellers bitcoins.

If I move my bitcoins to a new wallet still owned by me (which happens all the time btw), is that money spent?

Yes, 'corporations' technically wouldn't exist without government, but that is clearly not my point.  There will still be *massive* organizations that control the worlds oil supply, and every other commodity and precious resource for that matter.  You can call them whatever you want, the point is they will exist.  
The only difference is that without government their power would be unfettered and unchecked, and nobody could stop them from becoming tyrants with far more power than any government currently has.  You would lose your government, which at least in writing is *supposed* to be of the people, and replace it with powerful organizations who's only goal is to make money and obtain power. 
Who would stop Exon from gaining control of all the worlds oil supplies, or simply joining forces with all the other oil controllers?   Who would stop telecom's from gaining control of all the worlds communication resources?  Nobody would.  Free markets can only remain free if some organization has power to prevent them from forming monopolies or colluding together.  Free markets only work when there is competition, and without regulation, these organizations will simply eliminate the competition so that free market forces no longer exist.
Without governments, these organizations would become far more powerful than any currently existing government, as they would be global forces accountable to nobody.  Their power, money, and control of crucial resources would make them unstoppable global forces to do whatever they wanted.

The thing about bitcoin is that you simply cannot fully understand it or appreciate it unless you have at least a rudimentary knowledge of these ideas/principles and their ramifications:
1. open source software
2. distributed networks
3. public key cryptography
4. one-way hashes
If you understand all of these things, then 90% of the questions, concerns and misconceptions that most people have about bitcoin vanish.  For those that don't understand any or all of these things, bitcoin can seem either like a scam or ponzi scheme, or indistinguishable from other digital currencies like WOW gold.

What?  Exon doesn't need a government to monopolize its assets.  It just needs to buy its competitors, or simply collude together with them, done and done.   Who's going to stop them from doing this?  Huh?  It would be nice if you answered my question instead of avoiding it or changing the subject.  Who is going to stop these organizations from buying out the competition, or simply colluding together?  The answer is obvious: Without a governmental organization that is *supposed* to keep the free market free, it will not remain so because there is no incentive for the most powerful players to keep it that way.  Basic game theory here.  If there are no rules, then monopoly and colluding are the best strategies.

A lender would take into account the estimated deflationary rate of bitcoin and simply adjust his interest rate accordingly.  The minimum interest for a load would be slightly higher than the deflationary rate.  
The idea that people won't spend money under modest deflation is demonstrably false.  Every dollar you spend today could be worth more a year from now if you had simply invested it in a simple low cost total stock market index fund.  Despite the fact that people can invest their dollars and have them increase in value, they mostly prefer to spend it.  Hording is a luxury of the wealthy, and they will hoard regardless of inflation or deflation because in both systems there are ways to increase the value of your money.

They are the most legit company in bitcoin right now, and they just received $25 million in *additional* VC money from [Andreessen Horowitz]( a leading venture capital firm.  These are the same guys who backed Skype, Twitter, and Kickstarter.  They're in this for the long haul, scamming petty customers out of a few bucks is unlikely.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:23:35
You're completely ignoring the fact that the price of bitcoin is primarily a function of speculation, *not* supply and demand.  Supply is already known, and future demand is projected.  Demand can indeed increase, and price can decrease at the same time.  Price goes up only when demand **unexpectedly** increases.  Expected increases in demand are *already* accounted for in the price.  A Fixed supply of bitcoin in absolutely no way guarantee's that bitcoin prices will continue to increase.  This is Econ 101 here, and I'm shocked to see so many *experts* completely disregard this basic understanding of markets.

You really need to work on your UI, because you basically don't have one, this present an image of amateurism which is detrimental for a site that people are expected to entrust their money with.  Take a look at the other sites, and I suggest you copy them.  Also, if you want to attract more users, you may want to undercut other sites, not match them.  Perhaps make your odds even more favorable than the competition, but limit the maximum payout or something to cover yourself.

This guy doesn't understand basic game theory at all.  Bitcoin is absolutely *not* an altruistic model.  Miners *as a whole* must act altruistically yes, but **individually they only need to be greedy**.  Miners only need to do what is in their best interest, which is mine because it gives them income.  They don't need to have any other motives.  Models that rely up on *individuals* being altruistic don't work, as greedy individuals will exploit the system.  Bitcoin wouldn't have lasted more than a few months maximum if it had any dependency whatsoever on altruistic individuals.

Now you're the one with the straw-man argument here... I said:


If you have read any of Krugmans articles (literally pick any one, I've read them all) then you'll read that one of his main arguments against bitcoin is that deflation will cause people to hoard it, and not spend it.  






Krugman is a pretty good economist, but he doesn't understand technology at all:




Krugman is focused on the wrong things with bitcoin just as he was with the internet.  He doesn't understand the problems that they solve, nor how they work.  Bitcoin will be used where it shines, and where it is more convenient than any other currency, for internet and international purchases.  Its deflationary model doesn't preclude it from succeeding in these areas, and gives it a sense of value and perceived future value as you know it is, and will continue to be, scarce.  
Krugman is probably right about a gold standard based currency being bad, but that's an argument that doesn't apply to bitcoin because bitcoin isn't going to replace the dollar or other fiat currencies as the fundamental basis of an economy.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:18:42
Its intrinsic value is the fact that it solves a problem that no other currency currently does.  People give value to things they need, and there are plenty of people who need what only bitcoin can offer.  As long as these problems exist, bitcoin will have intrinsic value, its that simple.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:07:25


People said the same thing about the internet, and e-mail.  It will take some time, but the benefits and improvements that Bitcoin offers are too great to be ignored, and too great to not be adopted by the masses eventually.  If you have time, I *highly* suggest you watch this:

Bitcoin will never be the only form of money.  I find this idea silly to be honest.  E-books haven't replaced books, Netflix hasn't replaced theaters, and the internet hasn't replaced libraries.  Bitcoin will not replace fiat, it will work alongside it, and be used for those scenarios where it shines, namely internet purchases, international purchases, and purchases where privacy is important.
Governments will not give up their power over their currencies, and frankly I don't think they should do so.  There is no reason why people can't have both and use each one for what it is most useful for.

I specifically didn't mention android because it has loose/no restrictions about what you can download on it, while i-phone/windows-phone only let you install apps from the app-store.  Also, I also specifically mentioned using the web-browser to access the site directly, *not* an app.
I have developed apps for these platforms, and they are heavily restricted in what resources they are allowed to access.  There is no access to an underlying API to create a key-logger, or anything like it, for instance.  Nothing at that layer of the OS is accessible, unlike a pc.

This seems odd.  The very act of putting that order on there seems to have the effect of deterring selling.  If I had a ton of bitcoin I wanted to sell, I'd place a huge buy order down the line so everybody could see it to try to push the price higher.  Then I'd drop my buy order and sell.

It's not a scam.  Coinbase is not an exchange.  They are an intermediary between you and an exchange, and thus they take on the risk associated with bitcoin volatility since there is a delay between when you buy from them, and when they buy from the exchange.  If the loss is too great on their end (which is common when prices are rising sharply), they'll cancel the transaction so as not to lose money (They are a business after all, not a charity).
Coinbase was created to be convenient, and it is absolutely the most convenient way to buy bitcoins at the moment, *but you pay for this convenience* with the risk of your transaction not going through immediately.  If you want to time the market, then use an exchange directly, and you can buy/sell immediately.

It's absurd to make such predictions.  Bottom line is nobody knows, as Bitcoin is a giant experiment that could indeed fail.  We are in uncharted territory here, and it is feasible that Bitcoin will have to tread the path for a better suited alternative if its faults cannot be overcome.  It's also possible that Bitcoin adapts, survives, thrives and dominates.  There are infinitely many possibilities, none of which can really be ruled out.  The future is uncertain, but there are glimmers of brightness ahead. We just don't know if it's Bitcoin that is shining, or its successor.

Well, bitcoins have the advantage that your account cannot be frozen, or seized, but a bank has the advantage of being insured.  If your bitcoins are stolen, then they're gone.  If your money is stolen from a bank, its insured and you won't even notice.  
Bitcoins should be treated as a risky investment at this point.  I would not recommend using it as the primary store of your wealth.  We're still in the wild wild west days of bitcoin, and it will take a few years at least before bitcoin is safe to use by the masses, if ever.

The monster is out of the cage as far as digital crypto-currencies are concerned.  If bitcoin fails, it will simply be replaced by a new currency that doesn't have the same weaknesses.  A new crypto-currency could very quickly fill the void left by bitcoin, as they are so easy to adopt by everybody that uses them.  There is no going back at this point.  Even if bitcoin fails, its goals will eventually be achieved, and this makes for a very interesting future regardless of what happens to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:37:33
Let's be clear here.. Bitcoin is not an investment.  It is a speculation, and you shouldn't speculate with money that you would not be okay with completely losing.  I love bitcoin, and I think the future is bright, but don't be fooled by the over-zealousness of into thinking its guaranteed to go up in price.  The price of bitcoin is detached from its core technology, and is entirely based on what the *future perceived value* of bitcoin will be. Don't try to time the markets (highs and lows), you *will* lose money.  Buy and hold for a few years has been a fool-proof strategy thus far.

I have received a VISA gift card as a reward from my employer, so how would bitcoin be better?  It's probably easier to buy a visa gift card, and just as easy to hand out as a paper wallet.  I can see some scenarios where it might be nice, for certain companies with employee's who are really into bitcoin, but I don't see this is a huge selling point for bitcoin where its leaps and bounds better than the alternative.

With bitcoin, you only need to deal with an Exchange (like MtGox) when you want to trade your bitcoin for something like dollars, or you want to trade your dollars for bitcoin.

attackers would have to create their own factories to pump out ASICS.  While its possible, the investment would be massive, and it would take a while to get such an operation running.  Starting such an endevour right now would be a massive risk, as bitcoin isn't considered very legitimate outside of this subreddit.  Also, keep in mind that an attacker with 50% of the computing power would be wiser to *not attack the system* as they'd be raking in a boat load of money legitimately, and an attempt to attack the system would bring an end to that income.

The Government is going to make sure the exchanges follow FinCen regulations just like they said they were going to do, and they have.  There's nothing unexpected going on here.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:43:23


Yeah.. a few cents vs several hundred dollars or more depending on the size of the transaction.  You're making a great argument here.. Besides, transaction fees are not mandatory in bitcoin.










They usually have excessive fees instead.  Still, nothing compared to bitcoin.  


Once again, not comparable.  The bitcoin network would have to be updated to allow blacklisting of transactions, which would risk a fork.  Sure, people can talk about this all they want, but as it is right now, this is not possible, and there is significant pushback to even considering the idea as it would risk a fork as many miners wouldn't agree.  There's a reason why bitcoin is used for illicit purposes: People are not afraid of accounts being frozen.  The protocol doesn't allow for it.  Your comparing the fact that banks continually freeze or deny accounts, to the theoretical possibility that bitcoin *might* one day do the same when the network decides its in the best interest of everybody involved.  Very difference scenarios.


As I said, it doesn't matter *why* they do it.  That is no consolation to the business owner trying to setup an account.  Point is, they do it, and its a problem, and bitcoin doesn't do it, period.


The government will not be able to regulate bitcoin at any level other than the exchanges.  It is simply not possible practically or technically.  What are they going to do?  Put a police officer in every house to make sure nobody is running the bitcoin software?  Bitcoin transactions themselves are not regulatable, only the points of exchange.  Not going to happen.  Transactions cannot be blocked, and accounts cannot be frozen.  


Which bank allows me to execute micro-transactions?  None.  Which bank will never freeze my account?  None.  Which bank will let me do near-instant international transactions for free (or a few cents) at any time?  None.  Which bank will allow me to conduct a transaction without revealing personal information?  None.  Which bank lets anybody sign up for as many accounts as they want, without providing personal information?  None.  
These are all universal problems with banks, regardless of whether its their fault or not.  You are correct, Bitcoin isn't some magic wand solving all banking problems, but you seem to be denying that things like international transfers aren't a problem.  
Tell that to the migrant worker who sends home his meager earnings to support his family.  8% of which is taken by Western Union, and 5-7% of which is taken by exchange costs.  I am surprised that you would downplay such a thing and say "well, bitcon has fees too!" knowing full well that bitcoin fee's are optional, and those that are not, require only ~25 cents (which is due to be lowered BTW).  Same goes for credit cards.  
Any objective individual will acknowledge these benefits, even bitcoins most ardent detractors do, so it makes no sense that you claim to be "in favor of bitcoin" when you attempt to downplay these clear and obvious benefits.

You'll "make" far more bitcoins just purchasing them with your fiat money than you will from mining.  If you want to maximize the number of Bitcoins you own, then the amount of money you'll spend on mining equipment and electricity will be much much much better spent just buying bitcoin.  You'll spend thousands of dollars on mining equipment and electricity, and it will take months or years to recoup that loss in Bitcoins, if ever considering the payout is minuscule and quickly shrinking.

So, if circumstances change, and suddenly most people *do* eat these things (which is certainly possible) then suddenly the "intrinsic" value of cockroaches has been changed?  "Intrinsic" implies innate value that cannot be altered or changed, and so by this very definition, food has no intrinsic value as it can go from zero value to significant value over night.  Your definitions make no sense, because there is no such thing as intrinsic value.
All things which you claim to have "intrinsic value" can become worthless if society decides it to be so.  That is contrary to the definition of "intrinsic".

As more and more people adopt bitcoin, there are increasingly more people that have a stake in the system, so sneaking in a change will get harder and harder as time goes by, especially into critical areas of the code.  Critical sections of the code are not changed without a very good reason, and a hell of a lot of people code reviewing it.  Exploits will always be possible however, but the beauty of the system is that even if you know of an exploit, chances are you will get caught using it rather quickly due to the public nature of the blockchain.

It **is** a decentralized exchange... I've used it, and it does things that bitcoin doesn't do.  For example, if I want to send you some bitcoin, but all I have are dollars, or ripples, or some other currency, I simply send them to you and you get bitcoin.  Under the hood, it finds somebody in the exchange who wants dollars for bitcoin, makes the trade with them, then hands you the bitcoin.  That is what Ripple does.
Ripples are used for transaction fees, and yes they are admittedly dumb.  They will be handing them out to the masses to jumpstart the project, so they will almost certainly not be worth anything.

All the conversations we are having about what Bitcoin really *is* is just silly because there has never in the history of the world been anything like it, and trying to categorize it relative to what has existed in the past is a nonsensical endeavor.  *Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto-currency built on top of a distributed ledger*, that's what it is.  It exists in its own category.  
Its akin to how people tried to categorize the internet in its early days:  It's a digital library!  It's a digital news paper! It's a communication network!  All wrong.  It's in its own category.. its the bloody internet.  That's what it is.

In the entire 4 year history of bitcoin, what you are suggesting has never happened.  Every single surge is followed by a taper until the next surge (with the shortest time between surges at around 6 months).  Bitcoin prices follow a stair-step pattern (Look at the 2 year history with the *log scale* box checked on bitcoinity)  This surge is no different from all the others.

Now, this isn't to say that Litecoin couldn't also go up 100% or more, but the point is that the price is irrelevant.

I have an account with a few thousand ripples to play around with and its actually pretty cool.  I traded btc for ripples, then ripples for dollars, then back to btc.  
What I think is pretty cool, is that it merges a payment system with an exchange.  So say I want to send bitcoin to you, but all I have is dollars.  Well I just enter in the dollars I want to send to you, ripple finds somebody on the exchange who wants dollars for bitcoins, trades with them, then gives you the bitcoin.  So I can send you bitcoins, or dollars, or pesos, or any currency I want with whatever currency I happen to have.

You are making a huge assumption that governments are going to accept bitcoin.  I find this unlikely.  What is more likely is that bitcoin will be used an an alternate currency in conjunction with fiat.  It will be used mostly in the situations in which it shines: internet and international purchases.
E-books didn't replace books, netflix didn't replace theatres, and the internet didn't replace libraries.  I see absolutely no reason why bitcoin will completely replace fiat currencies.

One can only speculate how far it will go, but these upswings can have a feedback effect where the fact that bitcoin is soaring again results in tons of media coverage, which results in more people buying, which results in even more media coverage as the frenzy unfolds, which results in more people jumping aboard.  The launch pad of the April surge was around $35-$40, and it rocketed to $266, which was a 660% to 760% increase.
By this **completely dubious logic**, we can conclude that bitcoin prices may reach as high as $891-$1060 with a launching pad of around $135 if we repeat the April surge.  
In conclusion, I think its perfectly fair to a that the surge may continue much higher, and perhaps stabilize to around 50% of the surges peek value if we repeat what we saw in April.

I used Ubuntu exclusively for years, and its great if you're doing programming or some other things, but for consumers.. OpenOffice sucks compared to Office, Gimp sucks compared to photoshop, Inkscape sucks compared to Illustrator, and just getting flash to work in Linux was a pain in the ass.  Not to mention wifi and graphics card issues which are common with laptops. 
Besides all that, the UI isn't polished and its obvious that it was designed by engineer's and not designers.  Bottom line is that many proprietary software packages are far far far more advanced than their open source counterparts, and frankly I don't see how Open source can compete in these areas where companies are dumping in massive amounts of money.

There are several different versions of computer based wallets.  The difference is how secure you want to be.  The whole philosophy of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust any person, company or government with your money.  If you have your own copy of the blockchain, then you can trust that more, but its more inconvenient.  Now, this doesn't mean you can't optionally put your trust in some company to keep your coins safe for you (like an online wallet), but the point is that you have this choice.  There have been online wallets and exchanges that simply disappeared with their users money, so be cautious.  Here is what I do:
Put any bitcoins you don't plan on spending any time soon in a paper wallet (google how to make a paper wallet).  Put bitcoins you do plan on spending (usually a smaller amount) in an online wallet for convenience (I would recommend either blockchain.info, or coinbase.com).  This gives you the best of both worlds.  Maximum safety for your savings, and maximum convenience for your spending.  If you decide you want to spend some of your bitcoins that are stored in paper wallets, then simply import the private keys into your online wallet and spend them.

Unless you have any data to support that claim, then it really means nothing.  It's just as likely that people are *buying* bitcoins as gifts for the holidays as they are spending them for gifts.   
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:44:55
A wallet is simply a public/private key pair.  To put money in a paper wallet, you simply generate a pair of keys (bitaddress.org), and then send money to the public key (which is the address).  Now you control the money in that wallet since only you have the private key associated with that public key.  
Yes, you can use a wallet like electrum, multibit, or bitcoinqt as your main wallet, and then just transfer money to an online wallet if you desire.  
There is no standard person to person protocol right now, and frankly I think bitcoins are much better suited to online purchases anyway, but some people like to wait for X confirmations, while others are content to just see the transaction pending.  
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:35:03
Since bitcoin is digital, anti-counterfeiting is the  problem it has to address to be functional.  The entire protocol is built around solving this specific problem, which it does by keeping a distributed ledger of all transactions.  Disputes between different versions of the ledger are voted upon by all the miners with their cpu hashing power.  In order for somebody to insert an invalid transaction in the ledger, one would have to control over 50% of the computing power of the entire network, which would be no easy feat, as an attacker would literally have to build their own asics factory to accomplish it at this point.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:29:23
Selling bitcoins using just about anything but cash is very very risky, I wouldn't even go there.  The financial system is built around being able to undo transactions, bitcoin is the exact opposite.  You are asking to get scammed if you sell a non-refundable item in an undo-able transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:58:40
You're right...It's not a coincidence at all.  The price is behaving *exactly as we expect it to behave, in direct correlation with the media attention that it has received*.  The price is definitely being manipulated, but not by Mt.Gox.  It's being manipulated by speculators with lots and lots of money who are trying to make more money from the volatility of Bitcoin.  That's how exchanges work, and we ought not to expect it to behave any other way.

People simply *cannot* understand bitcoin nor its implications unless the understand each of the following:
1. Open Source Software
2. Distributed Networks
3. Public key encryption
4. One Way Hashes
5. The Consensus Problem in distributed computing, and how bitcoin solves it
If you don't understand all of these things then you have a huge gaping hole in your understanding of how bitcoin works, and why you can place some level of trust in it.  If you don't understand these things, then only a fool would trust something as crazy as bitcoin.  This is why you've got the people who actually understand these things (Silicon Valley) placing far more trust in bitcoin than those who don't (Wall Street).
Frankly, the longer the world doesn't understand it the better off I'll be, as I'll have that much more of a head start.  And as we've all seen, having a head start in something like bitcoin can be very valuable.

Decentralized and distributed are the same thing dude.  Decentralized means there is *no center* because it is *distributed around a network* which is exactly what ripple is.  Ripple is a distributed network, no question about it.
Your argument about ripple making its inventors rich is exactly the same argument used against bitcoin.. since the deflationary model of bitcoin provides massive gains for those who adopted it first, especially miners, and diminishing returns for those who adopt it afterwards.. Satoshi has an estimated 1.5 million bitcoins... so I wouldn't be using the "exists to make its inventors rich" argument against ripple..

If you are a miner, which anybody can be, you vote by deciding to accept or reject  updates to the mining protocol.  Likewise for users of the official wallet client (bitcoin-qt).

They don't think bitcoin will *ever* be a serious contender at all because they don't understand how its different than any of the other digital currencies that came before it and failed.  Have you listened to financial experts and economists talk about bitcoin?  The vast majority of them dismiss it outright and bankers are no different. It is hard to see this when all of us users surround ourselves with mostly pro-bitcoin media, giving us a false sense of what the majority of the world actually thinks about bitcoin.  
They're just as blind as every other industry that has been disrupted by internet technologies.  As I said, bitcoin is chump change at this point, its not even a drop in the bucket.  Most of these folks are certain that bitcoin will fail all on its own.

Use a paper wallet.  This is a *very safe* way to store bitcoins.  I have my bitcoins in paper wallets, then I just import the public keys into my blockchain.info wallet as a "watch only" address.  This way I can monitor my bitcoins from anywhere, and if somehow my blockchain.info wallet is compromised it won't matter since it doesn't have the private keys in it.  It's essentially a read-only online wallet.  If I want to use them, then I just import the private keys and spend them.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:58:55
Not just store the private key, but it would have to reveal it during transactions, as the card isn't capable of doing digital signatures.

If you want to reduce risk, take all the money you plan on investing, and split it up, buying bitcoins on regular intervals like once a week, or once every two weeks.  This is called dollar cost averaging.  It lowers your risk of purchasing at a bad time, and lowers your gains from purchasing at a good time.

*Don't buy bitcoins off e-bay*  There is a huge markup, and a high probability of getting scammed as arbitrage doesn't cover virtual goods. 
The easiest way to buy bitcoins is via coinbase.com, just link it to your bank account and buy.  Bitcoins arrive in 4-5 days at the locked in price of when you bought.  Fee's are 1%.
If you want bitcoins faster than that, use bitinstant via moneygram, though fees are higher at 4% + $3.95.  You can get your bitcoins in 15-20 minutes this way.  
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:13:38
I probably differ from most people in this subreddit, but I don't foresee bitcoin being widely using for retail brick and mortar transactions.  I would much rather use my credit card for that as it provides me with protections, its easy, and I don't really see any major benefits from using bitcoin in these situations.
Bitcoin will be used for those transactions that it is best suited for, namely internet purchases, international purchases, purchases where privacy is a key concern, and micro transactions that wouldn't be possible due to higher fee's of other methods.  
*Bitcoin doesn't need to be used in brick and mortar stores for it to succeed*, and frankly I don't think we should be trying to force it in that direction.  Internet retailers will benefit much more than brick and mortar retailers will from Bitcoin, as it allows people from all over the world to purchase their goods and services.  Brick and mortal retailers are targeting locals for the most part.  
Bitcoin is designed to be *internet money*, so we shouldn't expect it to thrive outside of the internet, nor should we be concerned if it doesn't.

If there is nobody in power, then there is a vacuum and power hungry individuals will eventually take over, if a foreign power doesn't do it first.  This is survival of the fittest, and having no government is a detrimental trait to those who do with have one with a large army.




I agree that governments are frequently used as tools for evil individuals, and I think governments need to be small with significant power distribution and transparency, but a lack of government of any kind simply leads to a less desirable one taking power by force. Evil people don't need governments to gain control, they only need weapons, money, and influence, which are especially easy to come by without any government at all.

Primecoin serves no other practical purpose either.  Mathematicians get just as much benefit from prime number chains as they do from finding the zillionth digit of pi, which is absolutely nothing except for bragging rights.  
Besides, this misses the point entirely.  Maintaining the bitcoin network is the most critical of purposes.

This is a common misconception.  Markets don't work like that.  They work from supply and demand.  If supply is restricted by any means at all, then price goes up.  It doesn't matter if I hoard my coins or I lose my coins, the effect is the same.  If I then proceed to sell my coins many years later, then the price lowers *at the time I sell them*, but until I do sell them, I may as well have lost them, because the effect on the market is the same.  My coins are taken out of circulation either way. This is very basic econ 101 here.  If you don't believe me, perhaps you'll believe Satoshi, he said the exact same thing.  As I said, this is very basic econ 101 here.

Let us suppose that a new objectively superior crypto-currency is created, perhaps even by Satoshi himself.  Let us assume that there is little doubt of its superiority.  What would be the easiest way to acquire this new nascent uber currency?  *Buy it with bitcoin*.  
Bitcoin is the standard because it has the infrastructure, and those who own bitcoin are in a massively superior position to not only recognize a superior digital currency, but also acquire it.  
Any new superior currency would likely piggy back off the bitcoin infrastructure, placing bitcoin owners in a significantly advantageous position to the rest of the world still waiting for their international wires to get through so they can purchase this new uber currency.

All value is a creation of the mind.  Things have value for no other reason than people agree they have value.  Utility has only little to do with it really.  There is no utility to a Van Gogh painting, or a Banksy piece, yet they have considerable value, and this because human minds have agreed upon it.
The might and power of the US government is also an agreement.  If everybody in the US suddenly decided that the US dollar had no value, then boom, it instantly has no value.  This has happened numerous times in history, and there is no reason why it can't happen in the US.

You don't understand.  There is no solution to the consensus problem without proof of work.  The arms race of hashing power is literally what keeps the network secure.  Without it, the network would be vulnerable to exploit.  There currently exists *no other solution* to the consensus problem with regard to digital currencies.  Go ahead and give me an alternative idea, and I'll tell you why it won't work.
The proof of work solution is literally a technological break through in the field of computer science, and is the cornerstone of Bitcoins ability to do what all other previous digital currencies failed to do. 
Claiming that proof of work serves no purpose is simply a demonstration of your ignorance of the inherent technical problems facing digital currencies.  *Centralization* was literally thought to be the only practical solution to the consensus problem, rendering distributed solutions impossible.  Nakamoto appeared with his proof of work scheme and literally solved *what was thought to be an unsolvable problem*.  Proof of work is the only reason Bitcoin is what it is.

As much as I love bitcoin, this is simply not true.  It will *probably* go up in price *in the long term* but in the short term all bets are off about which way it will slide.  This doesn't help me when I want to make a $500 purchase, so I buy bitcoins, then BTC price drops 5% for absolutely no reason, or perhaps for some legitimate reason, and now suddenly I don't have enough money to buy my item, so I've got to go by more bitcoins.  My point is that any potential savings are diminished by converting from fiat, and then I'll need to buy additional bitcoins to purchase my item in case the price rises slightly after purchasing my bitcoins, especially if I use a service like Coinbase which takes 5 days or so for my bitcoins to arrive.

Actually, its literally easy enough for just about anybody to do.  Simply fork the Bitcoin codebase, make some minor adjustments, and boom, you've got your own currency.  Litcoin is a great example.  
The hard part is getting everybody to use your currency, especially when you've got an organization with a board of directors at its head.

Fee's are an exception, not the norm, which are needed to protect the system against DDOS attacks.  When a fee does occur, most of the time it is minuscule.  It *can* make a small transaction expensive sometimes, but that is a worst case situation that is unlikely to occur.    
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:37:37
I'm much more conservative, I'm guessing around $125 by the end of the year, $200 a year from now.  I don't think there is even close to enough infrastructure to justify $1000 a year from now.  I give bitcoin about 3-5 years before it goes big.

Well, some have closed and the bitcoins were lost or simply never returned, but that doesn't have to be the case.  Bottom line is that these exchanges are completely unregulated, and anything could happen at any time, so tread carefully, and don't risk money you can't stand to lose.
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:21:33
Yeah, I think that halving the reward like that can be jarring to the infrastructure.  Suddenly one day all the miners halve their income.  Seems like it would be far better to have a continuous rate where the reward is modified after every few blocks or so.  It wouldn't be so jarring this way.

Bitcoin is *not* a company. Frankly, who would trust a corporation (who's sole objective is to make profits for their shareholders) with a global currency?  Would you use a private currency from a Chinese company?  Or a Russian company?  Would these countries trust an American company with their wealth?  No.  Centralized currencies cannot be trusted any more than the people who run them, and we are all aware of the corruptive influences that power can have.  Bitcoin is decentralized, no company or group controls it, or owns it.  It is owned and controlled by its users.
Anybody can create a crypto-currency.  Creating one is trivial now, literally, you can just fork the code base, make a tweet or two (almost no programming skill required) and you're good to go. What is non-trivial is getting everybody else to use your currency, getting merchants to accept it, getting exchanges to exchange it, getting developers to develop it, getting miners to mine it, getting the media to talk about it, and getting the people in general to believe in it.  This is what is stopping alternatives to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:33:41
In my opinion, he remained anonymous and left the project so that the focus of attention would be on bitcoin itself, and not who created it.  You can imagine how the world would react if it were known who he was.  All the attention would be on him, and the conversation we are having today would be a very different one.  He was a very smart dude, and it's quite clear to me that he had planned his actions beforehand.

I don't think its correct to view bitcoin as a *modern* currency.  I view it as a frictionless commodity.  It's like Gold that I can send effortlessly anywhere I want.
Keep in mind that volatility is impossible to avoid when you start with a literal value of *zero*.  You go from being worth 1 cent to 2 cents and suddenly you've 100% doubled in value with a single trasaction!  OMG volatility!  As the price rises, and more exchanges come on board, the volatility will decrease, but never leave.

You don't need to be an expert in cryptology to understand that this attack isn't that practical as the attacker has to be in close physical proximity to the computer in question, then the attackee needs to be using a specific implementation of RSA.

You can certainly call yourself a hacker, but you should be aware that your definition of a 'hacker' is probably not inline with the rest of the world's definition:
Words are used to communicate messages and meaning, and if this is not the message you are trying to communicate, then you will need to use a different word.  If my definition for the word 'asshole' was a happy fellow, and I proceeded to call my friends assholes, I shouldn't be surprised when they react as one would with the standard definition of that word.  And since 'asshole' is widely considered to be a negative word, then I ought not to use it when I do not intend to convey a negative tone or message.  This isn't rocket science here.

I find this theory incredibly unlikely.  Satoshi was a computer programmer, and a damn good one at that.

What does a bank do?  It allows you to transmit money from one bank account to another.  Who maintains and updates those accounts when transactions are completed?  Banks.  Who takes fee's from every transaction?  Banks.  Who puts limits on how much money is required to be in a bank account, and who denies customers from even owning bank accounts?  Banks. Who freezes bank accounts?  Banks.  Who is only open during incredibly restricted hours?  Banks.  Who's permission do you need to to spend your money electronically?  Banks.
Bitcoin lets you be your own bank in all these regards.  It lets me transfer my wealth directly to another person, without relying on bank or payment processor to do it for me.  I can open as many accounts as I want in my bitcoin bank.  I can put as little or as much money as I want in my bitcoin bank.  I can transfer my money to whomever I want with my bitcoin bank, whenever I want, wherever I want, as much money as I want, and pay as much as I want in fees.  I am my own bank with bitcoin in all these respects.

If you want some bitcoins, just buy some.  You're not going to get any worth any meaningful amount filling out surveys.  
All bitcoins are stored in the blockchain, which you can think of as a massively distributed accounting ledger that is spread across the entire globe.  Wallets simply store private keys that give you access to bitcoins.  Think of your wallet as a key to a digital safety deposit box where bitcoins are stored.  As long as you keep your key private, only you can unlock the safety deposit box and spend the coins.

Personally, I think the explosion of alt-coins is actually a good thing for bitcoin, as it makes it significantly more difficult for any actual bitcoin competition to stand out among the sea of alternatives.  There is bitcoin, and there is everything else, and its increasingly more difficult for bitcoin competition to convince everybody they aren't like all the other clones.

The code is open source, meaning that its available for everybody to look at, scrutinize, and even *modify*.  Anybody can change it, but this isn't an issue, as nobody will accept your changes if they're not beneficial to the community.  Bitcoin is a fully democratic system.  Bitcoin users themselves decide to accept or reject any changes made to the system, and naturally, they will not accept changes that are not in their best interests.  There is a core team of developers who work on bitcoin, and if their changes are liked by the majority of the bitcoin users, then those changes will become adopted.  There is also the possibility of a fork, where the community is divided between some update, and it results in a fork of the network, which wouldn't be the end of bitcoin, but it certainly wouldn't be ideal.

Second, it is not possible for a solo miner to know exactly when his mining activity will yield a block, and because the attack must be carried out within seconds or minutes of successfully mining a block, the attacker will not be able to know or plan in advance the brief window when the attack would be likely to succeed. While it may be easy for a determined attacker to get low-value items that are sold and delivered online instantly without waiting for confirmations (such as downloads), this unpredictability and the briefness of the opportunity would make it extremely difficult to commit any kind of fraud where real-life interaction is required, such as visiting a merchant or taking possession of goods. Petty shoplifting would be far simpler. Even if an attacker went forward with this attack, the retailer would be notified of the fraud the moment the attack block is released seconds later.
In short, the 10-minute wait for confirmation is only practically necessary when delivering goods of value that significantly exceed the block reward an attacker would have to risk to perform an attack and where recourse after delivery is practically nonexistent, such as money transfers.

Yes, for many reasons.  First, Bitcoin is a global phenomena.  US laws only apply to the US.  Second, such a law would be unenforceable.

You're idea is certainly not unique.  Whenever you see a situation like this that is appears to be such an easy way to make a ton of money, you need to ask why nobody is doing it, because there is nearly always a very good reason why nobody is doing it, and here is that reason:  The problem lies in getting your money out of one exchange, and into another.  There are fee's involved, a lot of time required, and limits on how much you can move at a one time.  It's just not really feasible to move money from exchange to exchange quickly enough.


For the love of Satoshi, *do not start trading*.  There are people who literally do this for a living and they will tear you apart.  Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme (though some people have).  Do not invest anything you are not willing to completely lose, and don't day trade period unless you're 100% sure you're better at it than over 50% of those that do.

This is what is so great about bitcoin, and digital currencies in general: It allows experimentation with different economic models that wouldn't really be possible otherwise.

Yeah, I don't see people ever fully trying to understand these things for the same reason I couldn't care less about how my car works, or how the plumbing system in my house works.  All I care about is that they work and that I don't have to waste any of my precious time trying to figure out how they work in order to use them properly.  
I foresee a future where most people use locked down OS's (iOS, Windows Phone, Android) most of the time anyway.  Installing keyloggers, trojans and viruses on PC's is trivial, doing the same thing on locked down OS is significantly more difficult due to the App stores, and due to the fact that processes run completely sandboxed on these devices, with very limited privileges.

Well, I suggest you look at the wiki article, but in a nutshell, if you want to invest $1000 for example, instead of buying $1000 of bitcoin at one once, risking a purchase at a bad time, you divide your investment into many smaller transactions over a longer period of time, this way purchases at high prices are compensated by purchases at good prices.  Its a strategy to minimize risk.

Paper wallets.  Large amounts of bitcoin shouldn't be accessible via the internet at all.  I think of it like Checking account vs savings account.  My checking account consists of bitcoin that I keep on blockchain.info.  Losing it wouldn't be that big of a deal.  The savings I keep in paper wallets with 'watch only' access on Blockchain.info so I can monitor it, but not be at risk from of it.  If I want to spend some money from my savings, I simply import the private key to blockchain.info and immediately spend it.  This way I get the safety of paper wallets for savings, and the convenience of web wallets for spending.

You are talking about saving *currency*, which is very different from saving *value*.  With a fiat currency that is experiencing inflation, everybody is capable of 'saving' money, but that does not at all imply they have saved any value, as inflation could result in less value despite having significantly more money.  
Fixed supply currencies *have* worked, so you're claim that they don't work is also false.  The U.S. used one up until 1971.  They switched over to fiat not because it was proven to be superior, but because it gives the government a lot of power.  It allows the government to spend money they don't have, and to pay bills by simply printing more money.  The U.S. was struggling to pay for the Vietnam war, and switching to fiat allowed the government to pay for it by printing more money.

Coinbase uses machine learning techniques to attempt to automatically identify fraud.  Anybody who has ever done any machine learning can attest to the fact there are are indeed false positives and false negatives with systems like these.  
Coinbase is taking on *significant* risk in allowing individuals to purchase a non-refundable good (Bitcoin) with a reversible transaction.  In order to prevent yourself from becoming a false positive, it is best to verify as much information as possible.  If you are verified for instant purchase, this scenario is probably significantly less likely.

Who would want to own something that is guaranteed to depreciate in value?  You see all the hype of people rushing in to buy bitcoins?  It's because people believe they will increase in value over time.  Without an incentive like this, fewer people would buy bitcoin, and with the inverse incentive of guaranteed devaluation, I see the opposite happening to Freicoin.
For me, money is first and foremost a store of my wealth.  I enjoy saving it, and I don't like the idea of being incentivized to exchange it when I don't want to.
Bitcoin incentivizes people to do what they are naturally prone to do, which is to save.  Freicoin incentivizes people to do what they are not naturally prone to do, and thus people will naturally favor an alternative to Freicoin so long as one is available.  Very basic game theory here.  Freicoin will only work by force or coercion.

If Bitcoin is as successful as many in here think it will be, it won't produce nearly as many billionaires as you think, as the vast majority of those people will sell their coins early when the gains are too good to pass up, which for most people, is far far sooner than a billion dollars.  There were a lot of folks who have been a part of bitcoin since the early days, and if they had held all their coins, they'd be millionaires, but they didn't.  They got out "early" at $30 for example, after making 20x gains on their initial investment.  Can you really blame them?

The point of the fee is to prevent spam in the blockchain.  If there are no fee's or the fee's are too small, then spammers can send massive amounts of transactions through the network.  If there were no fee's at all, they could easily take down the system, so bitcoin has to pick a fee that deter's spammers, but not real transactions.

False.  *Speculation* is primarily fueling the price increase. Supply is already known, and future demand is projected. Prices increase only when demand is increased *unexpectedly*.

The flaw in that logic is that it doesn't take into consideration human greed.  For most people, a quantity of money now is often more valuable than a larger quantity of money in the future.  Delaying gratification is surely the most 'rational' thing to do, but also the most difficult.
Case in point: investing.  Anybody can invest their money in the stock market and gain an average of 10% interest over the long term.. so why doesn't everybody invest their money if they are quite certain it will be worth far more in the future?  We would all be millionaires if we just acted 'rationally'.  But we don't, because having a ton of money and not spending it on stuff we want *right now* is very very hard, and few people have the discipline to do it.
I see Bitcoin working the same way.  People will hord their coins, they will go up in value, then they will get greedy, and either buy that car they always wanted, buy that house they always wanted, or the x-box or the whatever.  Bottom line is that most people are not going to hord their coins for too long when there are so many awesome things in this world one can buy right now.
Furthermore, Bitcoin has an advantage over traditional currencies in that it is far *easier* to spend.  I hand out bitcointips, and other random donations all the time that I *never* would have done with other currencies simply because it is so easy, and there is no disincentive (fee) to spend it, especially in small quantities.

Your private key is what allows you to do transactions, and without it, you won't be able to spend your bitcoins.  Your public key is like your account number, and you can give this to everybody so they can send you bitcoins.  
Public keys and private keys have a special relationship such that the private key can only decrypt things that are encrypted with the public key, and vice versa.
If you want to send me money, you take my public key (like an account number), and the amount you want to send, then you encrypt that data with your private key.  Now, anybody in the world can decrypt this information (which is the point), since everybody has your public key.  
When I successfully decrypt your transaction data with your public key, then I know that *only you, the owner of the private key could have created a chunk of data that can be decrypted with your public key*. Nobody else could create that chuck of encrypted data but the owner of your private key, so I know that you have *digitally signed* and approved this transaction.  This is why its important that you keep your private key *private*.  Because if somebody else gets a hold of it, they can use it to approve transactions and everybody will validate them since they were made with your key.

Buy $50 or $100 just to get used to the process of buying bitcoins.  You can do this in a few hours.  Then, you can go and buy more immediately thereafter.  Prices are not likely going to change that drastically in a few hours, and you are just as likely to gain a little money using this method as you are to lose a little money.  Prices could drop after your initial purchase, letting you buy more for your money.  The point is to figure out what you are doing before you dump your entire $500 dollars in it.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:52:08
because it simply doesn't matter.  There is one case where Satoshi specifically knew there was a bug, but said he'd fix it in 38 years when it became an issue.  (I'll try to find this ref for you).

Well, pretty much anything even resembling bad news can cause bitcoin to drop in price.  It is wise to wait for one of these moments, as 99.99% of all these "bad news" updates have absolutely zero effect on the long term outlook of bitcoin.  China news is a great example.  The fact that the country with one of the strictest monetary control policies in the world decided to actually let people (not financial institutions) use bitcoin is frankly amazing in my view.

I see absolutely no need for bitcoin to be used in point of sale purchases, that's not what its particularly good at, nor what it was designed for imo.  
It's far more useful for internet purchases, international purchases, micro-transactions, and purchases where you want some level of privacy.  It doesn't have to be the end-all-be-all currency to end all currencies to be successful.  
Also, double spend attempts can be easily detected nearly instantly, so point of sale purchases need simply watch for double spend attempts to have a reasonably high level of confidence in the transaction.  Retailers already risk charge-backs from credit cards, which statistically must be far more common than double-spend attempts, though I don't have any proof of this.

Insta-wallet's own caveat:


Please do not store more than some spare change here.
It's gone my friend.  If you decide to keep an online bitcoin wallet, ALWAYS use two factor authentication.  
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:42:29
blockchain.info with two factor authentication and a strong password is pretty damn safe, especially for $200-$300 worth.  The Blockchain.info site itself doesn't have access to your private key, it is generated client side (on your computer) via javascript using your password as the key, which is never sent over the wire.   There are a few attacks that could occur if somebody managed to modify the site itself to actually send your password over the wire, but this is an unlikely attack, and a risk I would be willing to take for the convenience of a web-based wallet and that relatively small amount of money.  If you have a significant amount of money, then make paper wallets for them.

First rule of bitcoin, do not ever invest anything you cannot lose completely.  
I personally believe bitcoin prices are headed down here soon, so if I were you (which I'm obviously not, and a lot of people will disagree with me on this) I'd wait about a month or two and when all the hysteria has died down and get in then.  
Or, even better, use a **dollar cost averaging** strategy (Look it up on wikipedia).  That is the safest way to invest if you are investing for the long term and want to minimize short term losses (and gains unfortunately)

And how long does a bank transfer take?  Especially if you conduct the transaction in "off hours".  How long does a wire transfer take?  Furthermore, none of these transactions are final even after "verification".  They can, and frequently are, undone much to the dismay of the merchant. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT HOURS FOR A CONFIRMATION, that's BS and you know it.  There has never been a successfully recorded double spend attempt, and they are quite easy to detect near-instantly.  That is all that is necessary for small amounts like your $13 transaction.  You are overstating the threat of hypotheticals, and theoretical non-practical attacks.  You know what?  Terrorists could also infiltrate the FDIC and cause a run on the banks, thus ensuring that all Americans lose their money!  How do you deal with this!  Huh?? This is the level of your arguments.

“He’s a world-class programmer, with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language,” Dan Kaminsky, one of the country’s top internet security experts, said of Mr. (or Ms.) Nakamoto. ”He understands economics, cryptography and peer-to-peer networking. Either there’s a team of people who worked on this, or this guy is a genius.”
DigiCash was a centralized digital currency which relied upon a central database to prevent the double spending problem.  This is bad because it had a central point of failure.  Creating a distributed digital currency makes solving the double spending problem much more difficult, and that is the genius of bitcoin, not its use of crypography, but its solution to the double spending problem in a distributed network.  Using CPU power as a voting mechanism to solve the [consensus problem]( is frankly brilliant, and only obvious in hindsight.  Furthermore, Nakomoto's implementation of this solution is rock solid.

General purpose CPU's are **terrible** at mining bitcoins, and as a result, Facebook, or anybody else who tried something like this, would end up spending far more money on electricity than they would get from mining bitcoins.  Bitcoin mining is really only profitable at this point for those who have dedicated mining hardware (ASICS), which facebook doesn't have.

Bitcoin is currently *mostly* a frictionless commodity, and if that's all it ever is, then so be it, bitcion will still be an amazing success.  When the fog clears, and the regulatory landscape becomes clear, and Bitcoin has established itself as successful digital commodity, then and only then, a currency can be born on the back of this stable commodity. 
As Andreas Antonopolis likes to say, bitcion the currency/commodity is just the first *app* on the Bitcoin network, there are so many possibilities with Bitcion the network that one can't help but compare it to the visionaries in the early 90's who looked at the internet and marveled at what lay in store for the future.

No, that is not what I am saying, and I agree 100% with your points.  I am saying that Bitcoin is currently *primarily* being used as a speculative commodity, and not as a currency.  There are indeed people who use it as a currency, but they are few compared to the speculators.  Furthermore, when/if the Bitcoin price stabilizes, then at that point Bitcoin is less attractive as a means of speculation, and more attractive as a means of direct payment without pegging to the dollar.  I agree Bitcoin doesn't fit any mold the world has ever seen.  I am simply saying that it has many shapes, and that some of its shapes will be more attractive at different times during its existence.


I agree that Bitcoin won't have its own economy *in the near future*, but as the world progresses, I see it as an inevitable result (Think 75 to 100 years from now). Crypto-currencies are simply superior for so many things *when everybody is inside the system*.  I don't foresee governments giving up fiat.  Bitcoin will exist alongside fiat, but certain groups of people will probably do the vast majority of their subsistence based on crypto-currencies.  Foreign contractors, and people living off of remittances for example.         


Agree 100%.  People will use Bitcoin for those transactions *mostly* where it offers superior benefits: Micro-transactions, internet transactions, international transactions, illicit internet transactions, gambling, remittances, or transactions of large sums of money where percentage fees are undesirable.  These are Bitcoins strengths, and we ought to be promoting and developing these, not brick and mortar.  


Only because there are significant profits to be made as the true value of Bitcoin is determined.  Bitcoin cannot go up in value forever (especially considering world populations are projected to *decline* after 2050, so continuously increasing demand is not an accurate assumption).  Once prices cease to be so volatile, then bitcoin will suddenly become more viable as an actual currency, though it can still be used as a store of value, like Gold.  As you said, it can do many things, and its biggest use may even be something that hasn't even been considered or invented yet.

Bitinstant takes 4%, and monegram charges like 4 bucks or something, so that adds up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:53:13
Yeah I can see that happening for some. Though I suspect there will be significantly more money dumped into bitcoin from people who have a boat load of it and are fearful of its value plummeting due to hyper inflation.  Those who are having a hard time putting food on the table probably don't own that many bitcoins to begin with, so I wouldn't expect them to have a significant impact on its price relative to the other crowd (the rich who are afraid of hyper inflation)

Yes, that is correct.  If you plan on saving your bitcoins and not spending them, then paper wallets are very safe and can't be hacked.

Guns, weapons, tanks, swords, spears etc.  He who has them has the power.  Have you read like any portion of the history of mankind whatsoever?  Anarchist societies have existed all throughout history, and they were all conquered (except for a few) by foreign powers.  The only ones that do exist, are protected by some benefactor external power.  
I dislike government as much as the next guy around here, but the reality is that a society *requires* some form of government for the following:
1) Protect it from outside powers threatening to conquer it
2) To keep internal powers from rising up and becoming dictators
Societies also greatly benefit from a government which works to keep the free market *free*.  Free markets function for one reason, and one reason only, and that is competition.  Market leaders are incentivized to form monopolies, oligopolies and collude together with competitors to rid the free market of what makes it great for consumers: competition.

No, you are not on to something.  General purpose computers are completely pathetic and worthless at mining, and solving a few hashes in the browser via javascript with even a massive amount of users that Google could do it with wouldn't even be a drop in the bucket of the Bitcoin networks hashing power.
A decent CPU does about 20 million hashes per second.  The Bitcoin network does about 7.6 quadrillion hashes per second.  If the entire US population (~300 million people) used their CPU's to mine bitcoins, it would result in about 0.00079% of the Bitcoin hashing power.

There are no Indian exchanges, and regulations are very tight.  This article is completely detached from reality.

All the BTC will be mined around the year 2140, but half of it has already been mined, so there is a degrading slope of creation until 2140.  
Honestly, there is one thing that I've never heard anybody talk about with bitcoin and deflation thus far, which is the fact that the world population is projected to max out at around 11 billion in the year 2050, and proceed to *decline* from then on.  A deflationary currency may actually be a *good* thing with a decreasing world population, as demand for goods and services will eventually start declining. Current economic theories assume increasing populations because basically that's all we've ever had, and few people stop to think about what a good monetary policy would be for a stable or shrinking population.

Most first world governments are not going to shutdown bitcoin because bitcoin *doesn't pose a threat to their national fiat currencies*.  Despite what the overzealous in this subreddit might think, bitcoin will work along side fiat currencies, and be used where it is superior to fiat currencies: internet purchases, international purchases, illicit/private purchases, and as a store of wealth.  Bitcoin will be successful in these use cases because these situations are where it is superior.  It will not be used by governments, and entire economies will not rest upon it and it alone.  Governments will probably step in to regulate the exchanges to ensure that consumers have some protections against fraud.  China, of all countries, is almost certainly pro-bitcoin.. think about that for a second.

Not at the rate Google is going, at least in the U.S. :(

I see no need to over complicate bitcoin.  It's already complicated and intimidating enough to the average person.  Besides, your solution doesn't deal with the heart of the problem.  The simplest solution is to simply create signed checkpoints in the blockchain that miners can sync to without having to start from the genesis block.

Meh, not much of a bug to be honest.

The sad thing is how many people actually didn't realize the absurdity of building your own hardware and software from scratch in order to be 'secure'.  Sure if people want to do that go for it, but if this is what some people think it takes to use bitcoin with any degree of confidence, then we're going to have problems.

"Heard something about Obama..."
Yeah.. I've also heard that Obama is the anti-christ, who was born in Kenya, and plans to turn the U.S. into a communist regime that practices Islam.  99.9% of all the things you 'hear' about Obama, especially from the far right are just propaganda.

Have you had any issues with your bank?  I have Wellsfargo, and I'm concerned how they might view around 10K dollars showing up in my account suddenly.  It's pathetic that I have to worry about such things BTW.

No, those are two completely separate things.  Gavin does not have the private keys to Satoshi's wallets.

Yeah, the Ripple thing is the only thing that really bothers me about that theory, everything else seems to fit quite well.

Yes, it happens quite frequently, because coinbase is *not* an exchange, like bitstamp or mtgox.  Coinbase is all about convenience, and since they sit in between you and an exchange, they sometimes have volume problems when things are very volatile like they are right now.  They are not perfect by any means, but they are a US company with some big time investors, so you have a little more reason to believe they aren't going to disappear tomorrow with all your money and leave you with with no recourse.  This has happened a number of times with bitcoin companies unfortunately.  
@_date: 2013-05-11 05:02:15
Well sounds like you've got a great opportunity to create the equivalent of coinbase in your country :)

Bitcoin lets you be your own bank.  It lets you send money to anybody in the world, privately, without permission or fee's from middle men (bank or government).

Sorry dude, but there is a high probability that you are simply pocketing all the donations.  Especially considering you offer absolutely no proof of authenticity.  
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:40:23
Uh, not gonna happen.  The whole reason people like bitcoin is the fact that nobody is in control of it to make drastic decisions like this.
