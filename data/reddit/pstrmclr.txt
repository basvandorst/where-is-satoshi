There's no reason to prematurely complain about downvotes. It's very common for a post to receive a few downvotes soon after its posted so you need to give it more time before making observations about its score. At least wait the hour it takes for the score to be revealed on the front page. Thanks.

Maybe you needed to give it more time before commenting?

Can you make another chart (stacked bar perhaps) of the same data, but with the trade types distinguished?

Could you also provide daily/monthly traffic statistics as well? Thanks.

Let's say the person blackmailing DPR and the hitman we're the same person which in all likelihood is true given there wasn't actually a person murdered. Now let's say DPR knew they were the same person.
What is the best choice of action in this scenario?
By being extremely casual about a hit DPR makes it less likely the blackmailer/hitman will ask for more money at a later time. That is, DPR needed to scare the blackmailer/hitman to prevent him/her from attempting the same scam in the future.
Obviously this would be difficult to explain to a judge, but if this strategy is really what DPR had in mind then he was never intending to kill anybody.

I'd rather leave Gox in because it is a data point. Maybe there should be a "bitcoinmedian" website.

Arguably the controlling body in a subreddit is not the mods, but the commenters and submitters which happen to be a very tiny subset of readers + mods + contributors. Meme submitters are suppressing or making it more difficult for other posts to be seen which if taken literally is also a form of censorship. So the question is which form of "censorship" do you prefer?

This is the top submission in r/bitcoin sorted by 'hot.' Why are you complaining about downvotes?
