No, not really - in fact almost all of Europe has far higher taxes. Go ahead and take a look at their taxation system.
In fact, take a look at the tax systems around the world. There's a reason that US and China are the major business headquarters of the world.

Yes, however anything I own has likely been built by workers who have also paid taxes, using materials which were bought or gathered and paid taxes on, on top of which I have paid taxes to purchase from money I earned which was also taxed. 
Let's not even get started on school - sure, Europe has somewhat free/cheap university education to some degree, but their taxes are far far far higher than US to cover those loses.  If we're talking about the US, that's a completely different story - the entire education system after Grade 12 is a joke in the US (coming from a European resident who moved to US around that time)
