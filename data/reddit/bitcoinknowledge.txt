That is a moral judgment, or in other words an irrelevant opinion, since the market will determine what the 'right' way to build a monetization platform is via the profit and loss system.

It is the equivalent since the STEEM is exchangeable for bitcoins. If people sell more Steem than buy it then the price will go down and vice versa.
For example, a post that earns $10,000 of value will have it paid 75% to the author and 25% to curators. The 75% to the author is paid half in Steam Dollars which can be immediately sold for bitcoins and the other half in Steam Power which must be held for two years but does earn interest. Some of the 25% paid to curators is also paid out in a mix of the two.
Consequently, when an author has a $10,000 post they will get about $3,750 of liquid capital that can immediately be turned into BTC, USD, EUR, etc. and the other value is locked up for a while.

What do you think Kraken is investigating right now? 
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:13:14


You are not accounting for compliance costs which Poloniex does not appear to take seriously. Since they are the largest exchange and help facilitate, either knowingly or unknowingly, significant amounts of criminal activity they are likely top on the list for the Department of Justice to go after next. So, taking that potential criminal liability and civil fines into account is important in the ROI analysis also.
@_date: 2016-04-01 12:46:39


I do not think you understand how criminal investigations work. LE will usually gather as much evidence as they can. Then they will try to get you to make admissions or false statements (perjury has a nasty sentence in its own right) to either LE or to financial institutions like Kraken [who will not lie or falsify records to protect you since that could incur liability for them and usually they are requested to not tell the person they are under investigation], etc. So, usually after LE has all the evidence needed so you will be found guilty then they sent out the goons to pick you up.
@_date: 2016-04-01 12:58:29


From Kraken's point of view, the problem is likely that there is **no distinction** between your clients and you when it comes to **source of funds** like there is with a bank account. Hence the [travel rule]( comes into play. Due to the volumes in your exchange they are required to do further investigation.
Unfortunately, from a cost benefit perspective you are probably not a profitable customer for them due to the increased compliance costs [which [all financial institutions are whining about]( Consequently, they should probably just stop doing business with you in order to be more profitable. The root cause of the problem is not Kraken but the US government and its lackeys.

As [**Bart Stephens of Blockchain**]( talked about nearly the entire Bitcoin and blockchain industry is entirely dependent on venture capital investment. If venture capital investment were to dry up, and it likely has been for the last 18 months at least, then there would be a significant contraction in the ecosystem and companies.
For example, in ChangeTip's case there would have been no salaries, no advertising budget, no conference attendances, no code that got written, etc. and none of that capital would have flown through the Bitcoin economy. In many ways, the well run and financed Bitcoin companies benefit tremendously from the poorly run and managed companies.
And this benefits the entrepreneurs and investors who make good decisions with profits and accrues to the detriment of the entrepreneurs and investors who make bad decisions with loses. It is simply the market at work.

Have you considered [LedgerX's new OMNI product]( Seems like a perfect use for that since you want to acquire BTC but still want to be able to have the capital to pay off the house.
Let us assume you are doing this with a $400k 4% fixed rate mortgage amortized over 30 years with no other costs. The monthly payment would be: **$1,909**.
For example, with spot BTC at $9,700 and about 87 vol you could:
Sell Aug 2 $9,500 puts for about $175.
Sell Aug 30 $9,000 puts for about $650.
Sell Aug 30 $8,000 puts for about $330.
If you sold 22 $9k and 25 $8k then that would yield monthly about **$22,550**=$14,300+$8,250 or about 10x your monthly payment. If BTC stays above $9k on Aug 30th then you just sell puts for Sep. Rinse and repeat. And to keep your wifey extra happy you could allocate $4k/month to mortgage payments thus paying down the principal faster so you are debt-free.
If you get exercised then you sell Sep calls.
For example, with spot BTC at $9,700 and about 87 vol you could:
Sell Aug 30 $10,000 calls for about $850.
Sell Aug 30 $12,000 calls for about $300.
I am using the Aug call premiums for illustrative purposes since you could roll these monthly or whenever. The goal would be to be happy with the put or call strike prices and then just let the premium evaporate daily to accrete value.
Thus, instead of just hodling BTC you could *sell volatility on BTC* with a strategy to be exercised into a net BTC positive holding but otherwise create a significant monthly cash-flow stream in USD.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:19:23
$1m USD is about 80 BTC at $12,500. If you are comfortable holding BTC then why not sell calls and if exercised then reacquire BTC by selling puts?
For example, O Realty is a very safe and conservative dividend stock that is about $70/share and pays a [$0.2265 monthly dividend]( $1m USD would buy about 14,300 shares that would yield about $3,239/month of dividend.
But with Bitcoin, why not have both a cash-flowing asset and retain significant upside potential?
For example, on [LedgerX]( you could:
Sell 80 $15k 26 Jul 2019 calls for about $300 each or $24,000. That is about $16.75/BTC and $1,340/day of total premium. If exercised then you would have an additional $1.2m.
Sell $20k 30 Aug 2019 calls for about $265 each or $21,200. That is about $4.84/BTC and $387/day of total premium. If exercised then you would have an additional $1.6m.
Sell $20k 27 Sep 2019 calls for about $550 each or $44,000. That is about $6.71/BTC and $531/day of total premium. If exercised then you would have an additional $1.6m.
The options could be sold, expire worthless and then sell the next month out. Just rinse and repeat like a dividend.
Then if you get exercised and have USD then puts can be sold and likely would yield more than a dividend paying stock.
For example, you could sell 100 $10k 30 Aug 2019 puts for about $520 each or $52,000.
And those are just a few simple cash-flowing strategies...

@_date: 2018-09-17 14:54:49
Sell covered calls on a monthly basis with strike prices for the 'minimal loss' amount one is willing to endure.
For example, a Sep $10k will yield $15 and expire on the 28th. An Oct 26th $10k will yield about $85.
Thus, you can just rent out your BTC until you sell it for your HODLGANG price.

The [full node]( and [network]( articles are pretty comprehensive.
Full nodes download every block and transaction and check them against Bitcoin's core consensus rules. Here are examples of consensus rules, though there are many more:
* Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 25 BTC per block.)
* Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.
* Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.
* Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.

He also participated in and did not object to the misappropriation of Satoshi's name, without any apparent consent from Satoshi, to be drug through the mud by being associated as a Founding member with these criminals.
3. Mike Hearn's first commit of only three to Bitcoin caused an inadvertent hard fork and the price dropped over 30% within hours.
4. Dr. Wuille identified and proposed a solution to the bug caused by Hearn's commit within 30 minutes and the Bitcoin community was largely unaffected by the split in consensus and some who did suffer monetary losses were compensated via donations.

OP appears to not understand that there are at least two major forms of consensus: (1) **network** and (2) **economic**.
**Network consensus** is the type that miners enforce.
**Economic consensus** is the type that users enforce when they operate a full-node. If people use wallet software that operates with a full-node (Bitcoin Core or [Armory]( then they are voting with their money.
**Delegated economic consensus** on the other hand is if users want to delegate this voting by using a representative then they can do that also (Coinbase, Circle, Electrum, Breadwallet, Airbitz, etc.). Of course, the friction comes if the representative acts in a way the principal does not agree with. That issue is *easily* dealt with by minimizing trust by **running your own full-node**.

I thought Cohen addressed it pretty well in the article:

Credit cards have fees generally structured like $0.29 + 3% of the transaction amount and **paid by the merchant**. Additionally, there is PCI compliance, fraud, chargebacks and time it takes to settle to the bank account.
With Bitcoin transaction fees are **paid by the customer** not the merchant. Additionally, they are almost always under $0.25 and at most $1.00.
If you use a merchant processor like [Bitpay]( then accounts are usually free to setup and for 1% you can choose to have them handle all of the network transaction fees and exchange the bitcoins into USD, EUR, etc. and direct deposited to your bank account the next day. Additionally, there is no PCI compliance, fraud or chargeback risk and you can take payment from anyone anywhere instead of being limited to geographies or jurisdictions which have credit card infrastructure.
Therefore, the value proposition should be extremely clear to a business owner.

Prioritizing what to work on is the hard part and being able to see actionable economic data would be very helpful in analyzing whether more transactions is actually meaningful at all since number of transactions by itself does not represent much, if any, actual underlying economic activity because there are no hard economic costs.
For example, using number of emails sent or received as a metric does not convey much useful information because of SPAM or no actual revenue being generated. But using (1) number of emails opened, (2) number of links clicked and eventually (3) number of products purchased yields actionable data based on economic behavior and can be distilled to a conversion rate.
By distinguishing the pieces in the funnel then optimizations can be carried out and tested to see whether it increases the conversion rate and by extension profitability.

Overall, it looks like a fairly secure system that will greatly reduce the attack vectors. Just make sure everything only ever runs in RAM on the Pi.
The largest security hole I see is you currently have a single point of failure which if compromised could compromise your bitcoins.
For additional security you could use Armory's Lockboxes and multiple Pi devices that are secured in multiple physical locations. Properly implemented and you would eliminate a single point of failure.
Combined with SSS (Fragemented Backups in Armory) then you would have a very difficult to attack cold storage system.
You do not mention the process you would use for creating the unsigned transaction. Regarding administration, having watching only wallets for Armory will (1) make moving bitcoins around much easier and (2) make creating multi-sig Lockboxes much easier.
One attack vector you do not seem to have taken into account is the printer. Although offline it could still be compromised physically. To protect you may want to use Armory's Secure Print option so the printer never sees the private keys either. Even greater weakness since there is a single point of failure.
Since you seem like a fairly advanced user then you may find useful this interview with one of Armory's developers on how to use multi-sig and SSS:

The current US population is forced by government violence to accept an inflationary currency for all debts public and private. This is blatantly Unconstitutional because only the States can make something legal tender but they are restricted in only making gold or silver legal tender (Art. 1 Section 10 Clause 1). The Federal government is given no Constitutional authority to make anything legal tender (Tenth Amendment). The issue of whether Federal Reserve Notes as legal tender are unconstitutional will not be heard by the USSC because it is a political question as phrased in Fischer v. Dover (
As a Liberal you should find this particularly encouraging since trampling property rights is essential for that particular political philosophy. However, you may not comprehend the unintended consequences that result which include the inability for society to perform efficient economic calculation because property rights are an essential element required for individuals to engage in economic calculation (
As Alan Greenspan wrote about 50 years ago:
"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold. If everyone decided, for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods, bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government-created bank credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves.
This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard."

Exactly. Now that there is an option I think we can shift our perspective. Those people who continue to hold assets in risky pensions, bank accounts, etc. may just be greedy and looking for a higher than normal risk adjusted return.

I think we are talking past each other because we are viewing and talking about different levels of abstraction.
The blockchain anchors unalterably the chart of accounts within the Bitcoin network. It is the network with its blockchain that is the first implementation of triple entry bookkeeping.
Your use case, which is a further abstraction on top of the blockchain, would require an additional layer in the stack to implement. Perhaps that could be done via sometime of colored coins implementation? And even your amortization example could likely be done through a time lock transaction.
As for your points about fraud, spoliation of the evidence on such a grand scale would not have been possible if using the blockchain and most of the time it is after the initial creation of the data that a fraud is attempted to be covered up through spoliation. With a blockchain integration the absence of evidence will become the evidence of absence and vice versa.

So unfortunate to have one so talented sacrificed so needlessly to the road gods of the State.
If only the State were not in charge of the management of the roads and humanity would be so much better off with so many more talented and productive people around, like John Nash, since only about 10,000 per year would be killed on privatized roads instead of the needless 50,000-60,000 per year being needlessly sacrificed to the road gods of the State.

You must not read much or are just incredibly naive. Most people in the developed world have already had their financial accounts frozen or otherwise confiscated in one manner or another. For example, over 20 countries have nationalized pension funds.
It should be abundantly obvious over the past 10 years that the greatest threat to one's wealth is from bankrupt banks or out of control governments.
In the United States there are massive amounts of legitimate small business owners being targeted with no due process and having their funds seized. The IRS has been targeting citizens for political persecution. 
In the United Kingdom the HM Treasury has passed bank bail-in powers and so have many European countries. In an attempt to prevent more bank runs Greece has begun taxing cash withdrawals form ATM machines.

Users can already embed the data you discuss into the OPRETURN. Then this could be integrated with the already existing NetSuites plugin ( The practical implementation is in the immutable persistance which creates the fact of the transactions having happened from an information theory background.

The language barrier is definitely real. I assume most accountants do not really even know what a digital signature is much less how it works. And good luck explaining SNARKs, ring signatures or indistinguishability obfuscation (which is where things will get really fun! -  And those are merely basic cryptographic principles to understand before one can engage in applied financial cryptography (
I think you may be missing an important point that the Bitcoin network is the accounting system in addition to being so much more such as extensibility (the time locked transaction would be for updating the use of the transactions for a personal ledger application; not necessarily as the transfer of the actual value), programmable trust (unfortunately, if you look at the world's entire economic activity and attempted to reconcile the books then it would be impossible because double entry bookkeeping has been so bastardized by fractional reserves, hypothecation, rehypothecation, derivatives and other financial instruments and how they are valued under IFARS and FASB whereas with Bitcoin and sidechains when they come it will be possible for example to enforce insurance leverage ratios programmatically), etc. but can also be used in conjunction with other accounting systems because it is both the blood (unit of account), the veins (payment system) and scoreboard (ledger).

Not everyone agrees with the conclusions, however. Armory's CEO and founder Alan C Reiner told CoinDesk:

I think the argument is not so much complete market collapse but that 401Ks and IRAs will be the prime assets to loot because there is so much wealth there and so little control by the supposed owners of it.

If any individual or company is doing things contrary to one's own interests, and we can presume that everyone has different interests, then anyone with the ability and resources can write and run any software they want, put into service as much mining power as they want and operate as much infrastructure like exchanges, etc. as they want and still interact with the Bitcoin network through permissionless innovation.
I suppose the perceived problem or conflict of interest comes when one does not have the ability or resources to exercise or compete in the market by writing their own software, mining their own business and running their own infrastructure companies but that is a personal problem and not a problem of Bitcoin and definitely not the problem of the winners because winners are not losers by definition.

I do not think you understand as fiat currency and fractional reserve banking and Bitcoin or gold are completely different from each other. More accurately:
When people lose their debit card they still have an **unsecured debt** owed to them by the bank.

I am not so sure. **Money follows management.** And look at Litecoin with a $125m market cap.
Core and Classic both have developers with significant reputations although Core seems to have a lot more and also a lot higher quality in terms of recent commits over the last 2 years (BIP 66, libsec256kp1, Segregated Witness, Sidechains, Confidential Transactions, etc.).
These differences might cause many people to hang onto both of their coins to see which side actually keeps developing features, increasing the utility of the respective coin, etc.
Several problems could come from either one team trying to merely copy the work of the other team [imagine if one team merely copied code and unknowingly brought in security vulnerabilities specifically designed by the team to attack the coin!] or a possible re-org of a blockchain, etc.
Either way I think a contentious hard fork will be a very exciting and potentially profitable experiment!

What one is 'strongly for' in the *public words* **can be different from** what one is strongly for in their *actions*. With Bitcoin the **only** thing that matters is actions as expressed by code run.

**Follow the money**, Antminer and by extension, Jihan make a lot of money, in the short-term, at the expense of the Bitcoin community and users by not activating SegWit. And I see nothing wrong with that and wish them profitable business.

I was thinking the potential profitability would come from speculating on the two different coins and their respective development teams.
Regarding your question about the property rights the answer seems pretty clear under [principles of accession](
An analogy would be when a [corporation does a spin-off]( and the shareholders own their original shares and the new shares of the spin-off entity (For example, Ebay spinning off Paypal).
Another analogy would be when livestock has offspring. The owner of the livestock or fruit tree also has superior title to the offspring or fruit of the tree.
But one never knows and it might require some litigation if an exchange or custodial wallet is obstinate about trying to keep funds which have been entrusted to them with a [fiduciary duty]( and it is a clear case of [unjust enrichment]( Anyone who does something like that on a large scale may likely find themselves in jail.

If Jihan were to give Roger 15-25% of the transaction fees Antminer were earning then it would be at least $10k per day.

Probably not either [fraud in the inducement]( or [fraud in the factum](
**First**, all that was represented by the transaction was that is was **valid** and that it had been **broadcast** to the network. There was no representation by PT that it was a six confirmation transaction.
**Second**, a reasonably prudent person would only rely after six confirmations because this has been standard advice from technical experts and industry practice for years. Coinbase knows or should know the risks associated with various confirmation amounts. There is [NO mistake of fact]( about the confirmations.
**Third**, there may be an issue for [unjust enrichment]( since there is a [party admission]( along with a witness. If this set of facts happened without a party admission then the duty would be on Coinbase to prove PT was the actual double spender and was unjustly enriched.
**Additionally**, your assertion that this is fraud and the implication that PT is a fraudster is most likely [defamation] ( I wonder if PT would like to sue you for damages to his reputation?

Well, that is one of the true reasons. I think another key reason is that with libsec256 it might close potential attack surfaces, Segregated Witness cleans up a lot of problems which enables Lightening Network and **most importantly** Confidential Transactions as a soft fork.
Having a decentralized, distributed censorship resistent digital currency with any potential attack surfaces closed along with privacy at the Core of the protocol is extremely powerful for the individual. So, it is pretty obvious that anyone who would not want individuals empowered in such a way with their wealth would want to pull out all the stops and try to prevent that from happening.

The issue is unresolved whether PT stole anything. Your assertion that he did is making a legal conclusion that may not be grounded in the facts and law surrounding them.
There is probably neither [fraud in the inducement]( nor [fraud in the factum](
**First**, all that was represented by the transaction was that is was **valid** and that it had been **broadcast** to the network. There was no representation by PT that it was a six confirmation transaction or that Coinbase should rely on the broadcasted transaction as satisfaction for consideration. And Coinbase likely has standard operating procedures which require more confirmations for higher value amounts which would show that they are fully aware of all of the risks involved.
**Second**, a reasonably prudent person would only rely after six confirmations because this has been standard advice from technical experts and industry practice for years. Coinbase knows or should know the risks associated with various confirmation amounts. There is [NO mistake of fact]( about the confirmations.
**Third**, there may be an issue for [unjust enrichment]( since there is a [party admission]( along with a witness. If this set of facts happened without a party admission then the duty would be on Coinbase to prove PT was the actual double spender and was unjustly enriched.
**Additionally**, your assertion that this is fraud or theft and the implication that PT is a fraudster or thief or some type of criminal is most likely [defamation] ( Consequently, since you have asserted this would make a good precedent case therefore a good way to get that to happen would be for PT to sue you for damages to his reputation under a cause of action in defamation. Obviously, truth is an adequate defense so if you can prove PT is a thief based on these facts then you should have nothing to fear from his lawsuit against you.
**Will you provide your contact information to PT so he can bring a lawsuit against you?** Like you I think this would be an interesting precedent case and might just fund PT's legal costs to see how this gets decided.

Bifurcating and modularizing the access issue can help lower the cost of access.
Broadcasting a transaction usually only takes about 1,000 bytes or less. Additional solutions can be built for efficient broadcasting. Perhaps something similar to a text message via an Iridium phone.
An immediate application would be with Lightning Network where actual transaction broadcasts can be done much less frequently than on-chain settlement.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:35:20


Actually, SegWit is ready to be implemented immediately. Then layer two solutions like Lightning could be developed because of the fix to transaction malleability.

Security is largely lacking among the public because losses are often socialized which causes moral hazard. Consequently, few take security seriously.

Another issue is why you did not have a PGP key with your Kraken account so that all emails they sent were PGP encrypted. Then even with the compromised Yahoo account the attacker would be unable to read the email.

There is no reason to do a hard fork if it is not absolutely needed and there could be tremendous risk involved doing one since we do not know what other chains may be out there or how long their work may be. It is much easier and safer to activate Segwit, implement Lightning Network and then reassess the situation to determine whether it is ripe to consider a hard fork. Thus, for long-term hodlers seeking perfection when it comes to security the answer is very easy.
Additionally, a soft fork can be done without miner cooperation. So SegWit can be implemented with or without miner cooperation it is just easier with their cooperation.
And, if a hard fork is required as no other option then it would probably also make sense to have it include a proof of work change.
It is also important to keep in mind that the work miners do is only valuable to people who **hold bitcoins**. The innovation from CPU to GPU led to about 200k BTC profits for some holders. The GPU to ASIC innovations have led to maybe 100-200k BTC profits at the most for some holders.
Thus, when attempting to interpolate 'stock votes' the decision and weighting really falls on both those who hold lot of bitcoins but more importantly on Bitcoin Days Saved (number of bitcoins multiplied by amount of time since they have changed ownership). Of course, Bitcoin Days Saved is not really publicly available or findable but can be roughly interpolated from the blockchain.

Additionally, it does not appear that the value is in either Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus scheme or in Bitcoin's public (unencrypted) blockchain.

Make sure you have Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 and [Armory 0.95.1]( 0.95.1 is much more stable. Your 2 BTC appear to be safe and in the addresses. Assuming your private keys have not been compromised, which is a good assumption since it has been about two years, then you should be able to get the 2 BTC fairly easily. Here are the steps:
1. Open Armory and restore the wallet from your paper backup.
2. Close Armory.
3. Open 0.13.1 and let it **completely sync**. This can take many hours to download the blockchain.
4. Then open Armory and let it **build the database**. This can take several hours but is much faster and more stable with 0.95.1.
Alternatively, you could skip the downloading and building steps and get just the individual private keys out of Armory after you restore from the paper backup and then use some other software to sweep the bitcoins into a new wallet. An easy option for this might be Breadwallet assuming you can turn the private key into a  QR code that can be easily imported.

They could do what every other financial institution does and treat it as a withdrawal. There is no reason to treat it as a recognition event.
For example, when one withdraws cash from an ATM there is no 1099 income generated because there is no taxable event.

If it were only that easy. Skilled speculators can make money with the price going up, down or sideways. But price is, in the long term, a good metric for total value creation and that is why hodling is the first network effect. When there is a large shock to transactional demand, such as a large loss of supply or a sudden increase in demand, then it can make the price go bonkers regardless of any fundamentals.
For example, when the Silk Road bitcoins got seized then the transactional demand float had to be reacquired and the price went bonkers as a result.

Keep in mind that since supply is set then price reacts based on two demand components: speculative and transactional. Speculative demand is the dog on LSD. Transactional demand is fascinating because the price elasticity of demand cares very little, if any, about the price of BTC. And the 'costs' of sending value over a communications channel are things like time, money, privacy, etc.
The obvious metrics are trade secrets like actual realized trading fees by exchanges or actual electricity costs for miners and actual number of transactions, etc. Regarding the number of transactions, those are increasingly moving to the 2nd layer in a trustless manner which has greatly driven down the costs in terms of time (near-instant), money and privacy (uses onion-like routing) and we can now *start* building out the second and third network effects of merchants and consumers.
As for the non-obvious metrics, well, I do not really want to talk about them because asymmetric knowledge is a competitive advantage :)

Yes, selling a covered call caps your upside potential in return for the option premium.
The confidence comes from several different tools I use for analysis like [S2F]( and other tools I employ like futures. Usually my trading portfolio (a small percentage compared to my HODL stack) is geared in a *leveraged long position* (I am probably too bullish for my own good but I do measure in satoshis not USD) and increases in value by letting the volatility I have sold evaporate (goal is $2-4/day/BTC in a very risk-free way measured in satoshis).

How could Bitcoin fail? How could bitcoins become worthless?
It has had greater uptime than any bank, central bank, processor like Visa or Mastercard, ATM network, etc. over the past 8 years and is not subject to any counter-party, performance or other risks except for exchange rate risk. Mining difficulty has gone through the troposphere. The Bitcoin network has no carrying costs, employees or other expenses that could stop getting funded. Unlike fiat currency, like gold bitcoins have never been worthless. Everyday that Bitcoin continues to exist and have uptime the more confidence there is that it will continue to exist.
It is getting increasingly clear that it is more likely that banks, central banks, payment processors, and other third-parties with carrying costs, counter-party risk, employees and other expenses will fail before the Bitcoin network will fail.

**Why** did Gavin remain silent and not fulfill his fiduciary duties despite being in such close proximity to both Karpeles and Shrem where he could have access to inside information or at the very least make reasonable inquiry?

I think most people underestimate this point. Transaction fees will incentivize miners to defect from the OPEC agreement to limit block space. Difficulty adjustment will happen in 4-6 weeks instead of 2 and then the chain will hum along as normal.
Hodlers have a very low metabolism in the form of fixed expenses whereas companies and miners have very high fixed expenses. Therefore, hodlers can go into hibernation much easier.
And, worst case, some ideological 1X hodlers can sell 2X coins, rent or buy mining equipment and mine the 1X change to get the difficulty adjustment taken care of.

The problem is that the AML/KYC rules are principle based on assessed risk. The standard is very nebulous in what actually needs to be done and the penalties can be very high. The result is that the regulated entities have to come up with their own policies and procedures and will error on the overly cautious side.
So, everything is 'tainted' because UTXOs all have unique histories and it is up to Binance to assess how much weight to assign to the taint which they outsource to the third-party AML/KYC service to shift the liability. The AML/KYC service has decided to assign a greater risk weighting to CoinJoin related transactions.

Last time when we organized the Ron Paul money bombs we had a thermometer that increased as donations came in along with a person's first name and last initial (political donations are already public information). The size of the thermometer was relative to the size of the goal for the particular money bomb.
It would be really cool if we could have a similar type of tool built and be able to implement it with different money bomb goals. We could also have different types of graphics as certain levels of donations are reached and keep the graphics unlocked on the page so it gives people incentive to donate and makes it like a game.
I also think it will be good to strategically time the various money bombs with debates and primaries.
For example, we could have a money bomb 2-3 days before a debate and the money bomb could be about the 1st Amendment or 4th Amendment. Rand wants to run as the Bill of Rights candidate so we have 10 potential money bombs right there. And each goal could keep getting larger as more people participate in the money bombs. Then going into the important debates the money bombs would be on the really important issues like 4th Amendment and Patriot Act stuff.
For example, if Rand Paul raised $10m in Bitcoin in 24 hours for the 4th Amendment Bitcoin Bomb to help protest the Patriot Act that he filibustered then it would cause a ton of political pain and get huge amounts of media coverage for both Rand Paul and Bitcoin. Plus, if he does it 2-3 days before a major debate then he gets to strut into the debate and bludgeon his opponents with it.
So that is the general idea.

Perhaps you can state with great specificity where would the confusion come from if you are running a full-node, with both BTC and 2X, and performing complete validation of the blockchains?
With running full-nodes then one can easily vote with their wallet by trading between the tokens just like with BCH.

This address holds [39,000 BCH]( and this one [35,000 BCH]( from miners. The average opportunity cost at the time mined is about $550 per BCH with a current price of about $315 (but there is not enough liquidity to exit the trade); so they are underwater by about US$17,000,000 at current price mark to market.
BCH is an awfully expensive 'disposable chain' for these miners that are hodling BCHs.
2X will likely have the same effect because of all the deployed Bitcoin Core nodes. One does not deploy a network on that size and scale in a month or two. Blocks taking a longer time than normal is actually good for hodlers because it decreases the inflation rate and thus devaluation of their hodlings which benefit the miners.
The decrease in block space will just result in transaction fees bidding for space. As transaction fees bid for space it makes BTC more profitable to mine thus incentivizing defectors from any cartel attempting to restrict block size space. Of course, everyone will say they are enforcing a block size quote but it is really easy to cheat and as the transaction fees increase it gets more profitable to do so.

As a hodler, I have no costs since I run my own full-node and manage my own private keys. If I decide to sell 2X for BTC or USD then I very little costs involved, just splitting, resecuring cold wallets and selling 2X. If I can make 10% of what I did with BCH then I would be one happy BTC hodler.

HODLers have near zero expenses. Users have minimal expenses expressed in transaction fees. Businesses and companies have many fixed and variable expenses with rent, salaries, etc.
If there is a financial war then HODLers have the slowest metabolism followed by users.
For example, if businesses or miners try to maintain a position on 2X instead of supporting or mining what is most profitable, for example by mining 2X instead of BTC effectively being a cartel restricting block size, then the BTC inflation rate goes down (to the benefit of HODLers) and transaction fees go up based on the price elasticity of demand from users. Then the miners who are members of the cartel defect and start mining BTC because of the opportunity cost.
Just like OPEC; everyone says they restrict output but also everyone cheats.

Thanks for the update on their sneaky change; they did not send out an email like when they raised the amount. Probably hoping to sneak a bunch of traffic from people who would otherwise replace all the links. I actually just got done changing the redirection on all of the Coinbase links because of the underperformance.
For anyone interested in knowing whether the Coinbase affiliate program was enough to give a decent ROI even at $75 then here are some numbers:
Over the past 30 days sent 1,893 clicks resulting in 659 signups (102 not eligible?, 531 account incomplete and 18 payouts) referral payouts or $0.713 per click. This pales compared to the average Google CPC of $3.70 for 'buy bitcoin' and $5.85 for 'buy bitcoins'. If Coinbase were skimming (a common practice used to screw affiliates out of commissions) and instead paid out on the 102 'not eligible' then the CPC would have been $13.65 which would seem unusually high; the revenue per click should have been around $8-9.
Either way, given the quality of the traffic on the pages where the clicks were generated it is my conclusion that the Coinbase affiliate program, even at $75 per user, **vastly underperformes** other alternatives.
**TL;DR: Coinbase affiliate program is not viable for affiliates and not worth spending the resources to test whether it is.**

Crafting a CT transaction will probably require integration with various wallet software.
An example of a possible integration would be [Omniwallet]( which lets you import a public key from Armory and craft unsigned MaidsafeCoin transactions that you then take via USB to be signed offline by Armory.
Of course, Armory could always support CT transactions directly but that would require resources to get that built into Armory.
As already points out, it is already privacy enhancing to use a full node when crafting one's transactions. This is an additional important reason to do full validation with your own full node.

**Brief Fact Summary**. Stephan Jay Lawrence created and funded an offshore asset protection trust in Mauritius with $7 million dollars. After Lawrence lost a securities law arbitration proceeding, he was punished with a $20.4 million judgment against him. Lawrence filed for bankruptcy and the court ordered him to turn over the bankruptcy trustee assets held in the offshore trust.
**Synopsis of Rule of Law**. Impossibility is not a defense in contempt proceedings where the person charged with contempt is responsible for the inability to comply.
**Facts**. Lawrence created and funded an offshore asset protection trust in Mauritius with $7 million dollars. After Lawrence lost a securities law arbitration proceeding, he was punished with a $20.4 million judgment against him. Lawrence filed for bankruptcy and the court ordered him to turn over the bankruptcy trustee assets held in the offshore trust. Lawrence did not comply and the court held him in contempt and jailed him pending compliance with the turnover order.
**Issue**. Whether a person charged with contempt is responsible for his inability to comply with an order to turn over assets in an offshore account if he was removed as a beneficiary under the account because he declared for bankruptcy?
Held. Yes. Lawrence is responsible for his inability to comply because even though he was removed as a beneficiary as a result of his bankruptcy filing, he still retained the authority to appoint trustees who could have exercised the authority to reinstate Lawrence as a beneficiary. The new trustees could have distributed the entire trust to Lawrence once he was reinstated. Therefore Lawrence is responsible for his inability to comply. Furthermore, it appears as if the sole purpose of the provision that extinguishes his inters tint the event of bankruptcy is to aid the settlor in evading contempt.
**Discussion**. The court did not accept impossibility as a defense here because settlor still had the power to transfer the assets if he appointed new trustees.

"If we'd lost the war, we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals." And I think he's right. He, and I'd say I, were behaving as war criminals." - former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara recalls General Curtis LeMay, who relayed the Presidential order to drop nuclear bombs on Japan
"In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives." - Dwight D. Eisenhower
"The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan." — Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet
"The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children." —Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman, 1950
"The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all." — Major General Curtis LeMay, XXI Bomber Command, September 1945
"The first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment… It was a mistake to ever drop it… [the scientists] had this toy and they wanted to try it out, so they dropped it…" —Fleet Admiral William Halsey, Jr., 1964

It really is not that difficult to read the tea leaves.
The price has already started moving above the relative price bands. For example, the 50dma is $236.40 and 200dma is $245.60. With the block reward looming the inflation rate (increase in the Bitcoin supply) will drastically decrease.
Consequently, large money has been positioning itself *accumulating* via dark pools during the bear market. The last large block of coins available will be auctioned on November 5th.
Then it will be time for the large money and HFTs to run the price up to sheer the sheep. Where will it go? Probably to around 3-4x the 200dma or about $1,000.
The infrastructure from the last major bull run needs to be stress tested and put to work. This next runup will also generate another cycle of VC funding of infrastructure. As the HFTs run the price up the psychological effect will be to suck in plenty of capital from all the small money and FOMO sheep that the large money and HFTs will be able to harvest. Then the bear market cycle will start again.
If you cannot make money in any kind of market, bull, bear or sideways, then you are a FOMO sheep.
In the larger macro picture Bitcoin is becoming increasingly viewed as a *safe haven asset* like gold with wings. As *currency wars rage* and with *specters of currency crisis* there will be capital that bleeds into Bitcoin as a very small hedge due to its small market cap. But as the liquidity and perceived safety increases it will be able to support more such capital.
And just look at the reverse repos held by the Fed. Who knows what might happen but if there is real turmoil then we could see $10,000 even though that would be 40x the 200dma; it would still only be about $140B of market cap. $140B is nothing these days; there is more than that stored in one vault at Zurich's airport. For capital, it has *never been a more dangerous time* than in the past 500 years.

As applied to Bitcoin, there are two components for demand: (1) **speculative** and (2) **transactional**. Speculative demand is composed from those buying with the expectation of selling it for a higher price later and, like gold or silver as monetary metals, can behave like a [Veblan good]( Transactional demand is composed from those buying it to use it; primarily to transfer value over a communications channel.
Where things get particularly interesting with Bitcoin is with marginal utility from transactional demand because of the irrelevancy of the [price elasticity of demand]( for such use cases.
To put it in language of praxeology from the [Austrian school]( What difference does it make to people using Bitcoin for its ability to transfer value over a communications channel if the price of Bitcoin is $0.05 or $10,000 per Bitcoin?
Any previous time there has been a large decrease in the supply of salable transactional Bitcoin then it has been followed over the next few months by a large price increase. First halvening, Silk Road seizure, etc. This is because prices are set at the margin based on the previous principles. When the float gets removed then the price has to rise to entice speculative sellers to reestablish a new float hence the importance of the [stock to flow ratio]( Additionally, because of Bitcoin's faster settlement times as velocity increase it decreases demand and price which further complicates the situation.

What is this impasse and compromise you are talking about? To me it looks like Bitcoin is behaving pretty much as intended.
Users of covert ASICBoost, like Bitmain is suspected of doing, are now making, at the expense of the Bitcoin community, **more than $560,000 per day** in transaction fees.
On the other hand, developers like Adam provide software for free.
Eventually, the price elasticity of demand by users for transaction fees will either price out use cases, result in a UASF or something else that people find valuable or useful and are willing to put their money where their mouth is.
If covert ASICBoost using miners want to price out of the market certain use cases and cause businesses built on those use cases to go bankrupt then that is just the market at work.

Actually, I think the risk-reward ratio puts the threshold around 5-15% of current mining power. This is because the non-BIP 148 chain **would always be at risk of a reorg** and there is no real way to attack the BIP 148 chain. For hodlers the risk of a reorg is completely unacceptable.
If it is attacked with empty blocks then all that does is decrease the differential block height which is extremely counter-productive for the attacker.
Additionally, for businesses like exchanges or payment processors (Bitpay, etc.) that do not at least support BIP 148 then if business losses do not kill them then litigation will because of class action lawsuits grounded in unjust enrichment theory. Consequently, there is a strong incentive for businesses to at least support both until the legacy chain is reorged by the UASF.

I doubt there is much mainstream demand for the type of software solution you are proposing. If someone only has $25,000 to protect then they can put in a lot less thought than needing to protect $100,000,000. The vast majority of mainstream Bitcoin users will likely have less than $10,000 to protect. Expert Bitcoin user demand has tools currently available to serve them.
The problem you propose has a lot more to do with the policies and procedures around the private keys, and the solutions lie there, than either the private keys themselves or the core protocol. Thus, it is too much of an edge case to really justify any development resources going into it.

That would actually be extremely counter-productive for Jihan because the only 'attack' he could do would be to mine empty blocks to stop transactions from being processed which would result in a smaller differential block height which would result in much greater reorg risk.
Reorg risk is completely unacceptable to hodlers and reorg economics is an asymmetric play for BIP 148 supporters. Consequently, it is in the interest of large hodlers to just sit tight and then deploy hash power to reorg. Sure, there is short-term negative effects for users but much of the value would accure to the hodler reorgers. Can't make omlets without cracking a few eggs, right?

In this case, there are two types of damage: (1) opportunity cost and (2) campaign costs.
For the opportunity cost, I could have run some other program or sold the impressions, clicks or leads. Currently all of my ad inventory is sold out so this would not have been difficult.
For campaign costs, the formula is pretty simple: commissions &gt; conversion rate * cost of traffic
For example, just the traffic I have bought from Facebook ads for this campaign has been thousands of dollars. That is not counting other expenses incurred (like website design for landing pages, time to review the results of the campaigns, etc.).
For Coinbase to unilaterally change the terms of the contract like this with absolutely no notice just shows how incredibly naive/sinister they are.
By analogy, it is like having a contract from a tenant for $7,500 a month but they want certain updates done to the real estate property like new carpet, etc. and so you go to work putting in new carpet, etc. and then unilaterally with no notice the tenant who has been enjoying the sofa that is on the new carpet tells you he is only going to pay $1,000/month regardless of how much you spent on the improvements in reliance on the terms of the contract.

Character limit issues.
Jimmy Song explains why you have to have [skin in the game](
"**There are really only economic benefits [for users, exchanges, wallets and merchants], not really economic penalties for supporting a BIP-148 fork** other than some fixed costs (running a node, changing some software, etc). These actors in the Bitcoin Ecosystem do not have to choose which software they run, they can run both and really, they should if they want to maximize their value.
Miners are the exception. When mining a block, they have to choose which fork to build on. ... **Really the only way, then, to have skin in the game and support BIP-148 is to mine BIP-148 blocks.** Everyone else will simply be running both chains as it’s to their advantage. ... There’s a real cost to change things and that very well may mean lots of money ($700+) spent by lots of people (1000+). In other words, Bitcoin is really hard to change, and that’s a wonderful feature. ... Whatever side you’re on in this debate, this is a certainty: If you want to change Bitcoin, you have to pay the price."

Kind of interesting that it would be communicated through twitter, facebook, the website and support article but **there was not a single email sent to affiliates who had either sent traffic to or received affiliate payouts**. This type of utter BS of **changing rules without due notice**, like 30 days at least, is extremely damaging.
Fortunately, **I was not running any significant campaigns** or, if I had been then I could have burned through tens of thousands of dollars in ad spend per day. But then affiliates only run significant campaigns for companies they can trust and depend on. Fortunately, I learned about this change by trolling through Reddit and was able to minimize the damage to only a few thousand dollars.

I think it is extremely relevant since we are talking about a cost benefit analysis.
Not only is there the increased cost in terms of time, money, privacy and expertise to use more secure solutions but software does not just get built by magic elves. And just because software is open-source does not mean that it is *free to use*. Plenty of the good wallet solutions are under licenses that would require the users to pay fees to the IP holder.
For example, if the license costs $1,000/year for personal use and you only want to secure $10,000 then it may not make sense to use the product or pay the license. And not paying the license would open oneself up to legal liability where the penalties or fines could be particularly costly.

There are basically four discrete parts to the order of operations for making a bitcoin transaction:
1. Scanning the blockchain for all the UTXOs
2. Creating a transaction with the UTXOs for inputs and outputs
3. Signing the created transaction
4. Broadcasting the signed transaction
Consequently, you can have as much time between each step as you want and you could use different software at each step. Having multiple signed transactions is a way to have a [Schrodinger's Cat]( estate plan with the first broadcast being the opening of the box.
A 'gotcha' would be [transaction malleability]( but that would not put your funds at risk.

Cute sentiment but I do not think you understand the type of resources required to build this type of software where individuals can **generate and hold the private keys of their own wealth**. Funding the building out of the core infrastructure the entire community uses has not been cheap and many people have made significant sacrifices of both time and money to get Bitcoin where it is today.
This type of cryptography and software code is complicated and to be sustainable requires very skilled developers. Projects can be maintained on a donation basis but that is usually not very sustainable without either **(1)** large sacrifices of opportunity cost by the developers, like the [extremely poor guy who maintains PGP]( or **(2)** a very generous and magnanimous financial benefactor. Usually it requires a combination of the two like Dr. Wuille, [Dr. Adam Back thinks is one of our community's greatest assets]( who took a significant pay cut to work full-time on Bitcoin.
To help you understand the magnitude; in Armory's case I and two ideologically aligned friends were the generous and magnanimous financial benefactors of the $600,000 seed round. Additionally, I solely and personally assumed, via binding legal contract, the downside of the exchange rate risk but let the upside in the Bitcoin price accrue to the company so developers would know their paychecks were going to be there and they could plan for their families. As a result, there have been **over $1,000,000** of resources consumed by the project. That is many many orders of magnitude more financial support than all of the donations of the entire community combined and **10-20x** more than the PGP guy's Linux grant.
And there are other wallet initiatives that have received significant financial assistance like my buddy Roger Ver who helped fund Blockchain.info and Roger and I both funded the initial seed round for Bitpay that has released the Copay wallet.
Unfortunately, great software does not just write itself yet and we should all remember that developers need to eat food, provide for families, use computers, etc. but that is not the world we live in.

Micky Malka was asked a question at Money 2020 in 2014 about valuations and he threw out a $1,000 number per active customer account. For an account that is setup and a deposit/purchase has been made should probably come in around the $250-750 for an affiliate commission.
Coinbase is paying for that type of customer (steak grilled and served on a plate) what most competitors pay for that type of hot lead (steak still in a package at the store).
Some examples from one of my affiliate programs:
* **eToro** - "As an affiliate you can get up to $150CPA for every first deposit. Get SPECIAL BONUSES for high performance!!" (NOTE: this is the most comparable to the Coinbase program).
* **AMEX** - 30,000 points which at $0.024 is about $720.
* **FirstTrade** - "$50 for each completed and approved account application when accumulated over 10 sales"
* **NetSpend** - "Successful completion of the online order form, resulting in a “Valid Lead”. ... 10.00 USD flat_order"
* **TradeKing** - "Payouts range from $45 to $75 (or more for higher-quality accounts!)."

Perhaps you may want to read some [Mises on Profit and Loss]( I have bolded words that would be helpful for you to understand.
The first network effect of Bitcoin is speculation. Speculation about what the future price of Bitcoin will be. And that **price discovery** is happening every day and every minute.
Thus, there exists asymmetric knowledge in the economy. Individuals allocate time, attention, skill and capital based on their own individual **time preferences** and, in the case of Bitcoin, there are many **creative geniuses**. This is the mechanism of **economic calculation**.
The bottom line is: Those who are correct reap **profits**. Those who are incorrect reap **losses**.

It is kind of funny; people just waltz right in and think they should be able to start using Bitcoin competently. Last month a friend of mine emailed wanting to buy $500k worth of Bitcoin. I had even showed him how to use it about 3 years ago but he had never been diligent enough on his own to get pipelines of supply setup or understand how to properly secure with something like Armory. One does not simply use Bitcoin.
Fortunately, he has at least figured out how to source some Bitcoin but not after a lot of frustration but he feels nowhere close to competent to store a very large amount. We have a good chuckle because his ignorance was so expensive.
For example, his email on Jan 14th when BTC was about $190 would have got him about 2,630 BTC and that would sell today at $240 for about $630k. Sure is expensive being ignorant of how new technology works.

Notice how the ad hominem attack took the same approach as the Kavanaugh hearings by providing no credible or verifiable evidence.
Seems wise to stay skeptical; particularly with nameless, faceless Internet trolls that could just as easily be bots or paid disinformation agents.

Bitcoin is probably the highest probability asymmetric trade ever. So it would be right up Kyle's alley. Additionally, why let everyone else know since it might only increase demand which would drive the price up? Buy cheap over the next six months and then sell expensive, if ever.

Probably so that they can tie your identity to having purchased a Ledger. And if you use their full-node to check your balances then they can also tie how many BTC you have with your personal identity. I suppose that type of personal information could probably be very valuable to lots of different parties.
Just another reason to run your own full-node and hold you own private keys. [Proof of Keys](

There is the problem. If there is a UASF then there could be two coins but it would not be like a HF because the legacy chain could always be wiped out and reorged into a single coin.

Even worse is that banks like to [slash the lines of credit and call loans]( that way they get to seize assets because of cash flow problems. Happened a lot during 2007-2010. You should assume the banks want to do this if the collateral is sufficient and easy to seize.

You should check out the [UASF Guide]( to see how much support there is and what to do.
Really, only miners have to actively choose between chains; everyone else can do both of them with minimal investment. The reorg where lots of people lose money on the legacy chain is considered a feature not a bug by some.
