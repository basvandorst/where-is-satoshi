This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:07:03
classic r/bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:25:20
Fuck the government! …. oh wait….
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:00:00
thats still pretty shitty for new york city...Vancouver even has more
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:33:17
Oh, one quick question before you lawyer up. 
Should I sell?
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:36:09
More bars need to accept BTC in NYC. Its sad, there is only 1 bar in the entire city
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:30:29
I noticed that as well.
@_date: 2013-05-25 16:03:07
Yes, but I feel humans tend to be more greedy then generous. You really think people will donate their money to roads? They might build a road from their house to a grocery store, or whatever else in in their personal convenience, but not at a society at large.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:03:16
pfff, yea suureeee. And here is his address too: 1LcA9fbYyuYQBtWhRyxFfXkJNMDYmNMMVj

Don't worry, its not over yet. Correction just started. P.S Whats the name? Crash?
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:39:44
and its on sale again now, for cheaper....
Its a terrible time to buy
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:37:22
came here to say that. Im glad this was top comment instead of people giving thousands in bitcointips
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:23:47
i don't mind the memes mixed in. I like to get my bitcoin news all in one sub. I will never go to and then and then @_date: 2013-05-25 17:30:35
I'm Canadian, and I think we are on the same page. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 19:04:39
I understand. "I made no agreement with the state that taxes me" thats a problem.
Looks like we need a new system. I just hope that when we have democracy 2.0, people are not selfish and still contribute to a society where we can help each other, know what I mean?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:14:38
I wish I was a dev! But as someone in NYC, there needs to be more merchants in this city. I can't wait for a decent bar to accept BTC
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:12:51
Thats amazing. I would send, how do I know its not a scam?
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:36:33
Dude, just go to Vancouver!
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:41:02
Oh fuck, I asked a [question along those lines]( yesterday. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:50:02
looks like I predicted it perfectly
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:47:58
If that's you're argument, then how come healthcare costs more in the USA then Canada?
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:11:17
Dammit, I wish I could of bought some when this panic dips.
@_date: 2013-05-25 16:07:25
No, violence against those who disagree is not democracy in my books, but that's a whole other thread.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:44:04
I'm Canadian, apparently my country has a better reputation then yours, so i can understand your opinion on tax if that is the case. Although, not all governments/people are as corrupt as yours.
@_date: 2013-05-26 20:30:01
democratic socialist bitcoin supporter here!
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:48:05
ummm, no....i love my mom. Just generalizing. If I said my grandma doesn't know how to install a Skyrim mod, does that make me anti-women?
@_date: 2013-05-25 15:06:56
...* Gulp * :s
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:43:38
damn, i always miss these. Is there a website for this? Or is it every monday?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:56:00
did i do it right? its my first tip
@_date: 2013-05-25 14:44:31
"Forcibly extracting" seems a bit harsh to me. I choose who to vote for, to represent my views, I vote for how i want my tax dollars to be spent. 
Also, a problem with voluntary "tax" is the fact that no one will voluntarily donate thier money to infrastructure, etc. a few people will, but It will easily be taken advantage of, and people will most likely adapt the "well he is not paying for the roads, why should I?" Therefore, no roads are built.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:09:06
wow, i hope you cashed in on that amazing deal at 360
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:40:48
even a "tech savy" nerd like me finds it confusing. Like I always say, "fix it so my mom can use it"
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:55:20
only reasonable answer in this thread. 
+0.01 BTC
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:47:25
Read it. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:32:20
What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:34:13
......Im... kind of tired......I think I'm going to go home now
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:40:55
No. We just have different political views. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:32:47
I doubt the starbucks thing is true. Im pretty sure they have a deal with Square. When Square jumps on the bitcoin bandwagon though - watch out
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:07:54
yea haha it was more of a joke
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:41:50
Maybe I should re-do the question
@_date: 2013-05-25 14:54:18
I like paying my fair share to contribute to the infrastructure of my country. It my be "forced", but i freely chose the party that is "forcing" me to do so. Also, in my country (canada) we have more then two options of parties to choose from (including an anarchist party) so if you don't like paying taxes, you can vote for them. So in a sense, my country's system is not forcing anyone to do anything.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:57:33
Bitcoin technology itself is great, now its up to software developers and great community of bitcoin thinkers to make it more accessible, simple, and more secure so its just as easy (or easier) as current banking. Thats really what I meant by "fix"
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:39:42
The problem is, when this guy posts in he will get downvoted there too, because the chart has a negative outlook. It happened to me [last week when I predicted the first crash]( OP don't bother wasting your time in any sub, reddit only up votes good news. I gave up sharing any kind of TA with reddit, Its like feeding pearls to swine. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:52:46
lol is delusional. Only one comment here out of 15 say sell. I think you have a great strategy. Sell some for a profit, hopefully to buy in cheaper, and hold onto the others. Don't listen to this sub for advice, they are all obviously biased. I sold mine and plan on buying cheaper coins. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-10-05 06:33:37
yay socialism!
@_date: 2013-05-25 15:04:59
To be honest, I think if we were not "forced" no one would bother paying anything. Look at nfrastructure for example, who would pay for the roads? And I say "forced" in quotations because is it forced when we freely choose the party to represent us, and use our tax dollars? (I understand a lot of Americans hate both parties right now, but I am from another country)
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:32:59
Easy there partner....zoom out on your chart and you will see bitcoins are not on sale. We are in a bubble. Too risky to make a post and say we are on sale.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:44:49
Scroll though these comments.
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:59:44
Thanks. I just had a look, and unfortunately, there are only two places that accept bitcoin so far in my city (with a population of 6.5 million.) Thats pretty brutal
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:53:18
FUCK i woke up my girlfriend laughing so hard at that. I don't even know if you meant it as a joke. Dat thumbnail tho 
@_date: 2013-05-25 14:47:46
But do we not vote? I feel the problem is more with how America's political system is set up, not with democracy itself.
@_date: 2013-05-25 17:29:11
Haha yes actually. I'm not a fan of our current government, but I like how our tax dollars have built this country into what it is. I have had a very good life.
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:18:16
Hey! There are not a lot of nathanAels out there! :D
