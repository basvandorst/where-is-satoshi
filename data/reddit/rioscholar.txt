I think you are confused between the terms long-run and short-run. However, I understand your sentiment! :)
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:33:20
where is the actual evidence?
@_date: 2014-09-03 16:47:36
Am I missing something important?
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:53:22
Yeah, well now me and everyone I know is not investing in this crap anymore
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:20:00
Funny thing is that I was a big promoter of bitcoin on my college campus. Even argued with professors. Now, I'm DONE!

Not expecting anything
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:45:18
maybe try sending via email
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:42:41
The thing is that i was not expecting to lose 47% in three months. That is where the mood swing comes from?
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:17:31
what is the point if people will be losing money from my project?
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:25:23
I am divesting because my initial investment value has decreased by a HALF. And, I am telling people NOT to invest into bitcoin anymore because it is unstable! This is worse than gambling. I cannot support something that makes my life worse.
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:44:52
what would he say?
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:44:28
It's not about getting rich... It's about not losing HALF of my money
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:39:20
this was the worst investment i have ever made and could ever make
@_date: 2014-09-04 12:50:45
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:57:34
It is important to recall that money is a pure abstraction!
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:02:18
where is the price now?
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:17:57
what are you even talking about bro
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:26:30
It's about change.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:20:45
I did NOT want to get rich quick... I was in it for the technology. I CANNOT afford to constantly lose value. Is that unreasonable? EDIT: 50%!
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:25:10
Some people are short bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:38:53
No... but i was not expecting such a huge price decrease... 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:16:49
I am mad because I liked bitcoin as a technology, but I cannot support something that makes me lose half of my money. This is absolutely stupid.
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:01:19
i would love to work for a company that supports bitcoin in any way
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:04:17
Seems legit
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:09:28
What does B2B stand for?
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:55:15
Losing over half of an investment is too much to handle. Is it not? The technology can be duplicated anywho
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:26:12
Okay. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:13:30
The reason why Bitcoin is dying is because everyone who has faith in it keeps losing their money. Everyone except for the early adopters. EVERY person I know has lost more than 35% in their original investment. Bitcoin has caused more harm in the lives of people I know than the United States Dollar has!
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:14:12
Keep losing your money kid
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:08:43
This (money as an abstraction)is only true because it is a social convention! Social conventions are pure abstractions as well! Moreover, faith (fiat) is not fake or real - it is another form of control (for an individual or a group)... So is money.

where do you go to school
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:02:50
Concerning your lending comments... what if the price of Bitcoin "stabilizes" ?
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:28:53

What is your time frame? Otherwise, your statement is trivial.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:26:43
Some people are social investors.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:12:10
okay! doesnt make my post any less valid! not everything is about explicit profits! :)
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:10:25
Yeah. i guess i just over invested
