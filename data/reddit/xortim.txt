It's based on DeBitpay, you can read more on that tool [here](

These are all great questions/concerns. In the end, your personal threat model is yours. I had reached out to Trezor support and received the following responses
* Is the Trezor wallet/bridge daemon an SPV node?
  * no
* If not, how does it perform transaction validation?
  * it doesn't, TREZOR understands the transaction, but it doesn't need to be confirmed on the blockchain ([signing.py](
* If querying a third party server, how is my privacy protected?
  * if it goes to TREZOR servers, you have to trust us. If you do not want to, you can run TREZOR on other servers (trust them), resp. your own.

A couple of suggestions to help you get some answers to these questions:
* Pull up your dev tools and watch the interactions between your browser and the bridge daemon
* Same for the daemon and the Trezor bitcore servers.
* Look for something similar to [OpenSnitch]( or [LittleSnitch]( for your platform.
Last I checked, bitcore didn't support scanning an xpub, and only added three indexes to Bitcoin Core's bitcoind. 
1. `addressindex`
2. `spentindex`
3. `timestampindex`
See "New Indexes" on the [bitpay guide]( You can also see the type of data that is returned in the new RPC methods and updates section on that same page.
One of the reasons they're using such a service is to help with trust and privacy - you can inspect the source on GitHub and you can run your own node if you so choose. More info on their [blog post]( about it.
In the end, is it _possible_ for Trezor to create a graph of this information 'track' you. Yes. Are they? Probably not. It's highly unlikely that they have the time and resources to implement such a system.
