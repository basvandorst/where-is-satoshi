What?  So you think that large currency or equity markets have never been manipulated?  That's very naive. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:00:50
My point is that if currencies were not regulated by governments it would be a (much bigger) fucking mess even if they had big market share. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:07:00
Well you sure came off as disagreeable if you were actually agreeing with me. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:52:34
Yes, I realized that an ninja edited my comment to: a market that is just as stable and secure as a well-regulated one? 
Please site your evidence.  Genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:33:51
There are a lot of stable currencies in the world and their stability has nothing to do with Consumer Reports. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:14:54
Consumer Reports as a panacea to market manipulation?  Ha
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:04:06
Large markets can be deliberately manipulated as well, it is more than just market share. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:28:43
So then what do you disagree with?
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:39:32
Oh right, that was you.... So do you have any source besides your own intuition that voluntary compliance would lead to a market that is just as stable and secure as a well-regulated one?   
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:29:13
Since when?
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:51:13
Well, the value of the dollar has not fallen 500% in the past decade. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:35:39
What?  You think hedge funds are a stabilizing force and don't contribute to bubbles?  Have you paid attention to the world of finance in the past two decades? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:08:51
Sounds to me more like a "vehicle for speculation" than a "currency"
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:43:30
I just rewatched the Colbert piece and Adam never calls it a bad investment.  He even says if your goal is speculation(money you don't need) then Bitcoin is a "reasonable investment."   
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:04:40
Since when do the basics of investing say that big markets cant have bubbles/crashes?  Please point me to that information(seriously, I would like to see this theory in detail, even if I disagree). Of course if Bitcoin continues to grow it will stop having day-to-day crashes of half its value(because it will have long collapsed by then if it continues that behavior).  But just because the market is bigger, that in no way guarantees stability.  There are crashes in big markets too.  Also the reason "real" currencies dont have such wild swings is MUCH more complicated than "there is a lot of it."   For instance, even if you think the USD is a joke you will still NEED it to pay your taxes.  As long as the US govt is collecting taxes there will always be a demand for USD.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:16:25
I agree that if it survives it will of course be "more stable" but given the numbers(only what I heard on Colbert) its hard to imagine a legitimate currency being any "less stable" than what BTC is currently.  More stable is not the same as stable.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:11:56
What protection will Bitcoin have against volatility in the future that it does not have now?
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:22:47
No one addressing his main criticism: that it has INSANE day-to-day fluctuations in value(I have no idea, but since no one is refuting I will assume that is true).  Not just fluctuations, the numbers he was saying were INSANE.  Who would want a "currency" that could lose half it's value while you're taking a nap?  Speculation is fine, but this isn't billed as a vehicle for speculation it is being advertised as a currency.   Other than bashing Colbert and his guest's spot on bitcoin I haven't see anyone refute the claim that Bitcoin will be beholden to speculators and manipulation and permanently be cursed with wild volatility making it a poor choice for "currency" in any traditional sense.  
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:36:24
What discussion of bitcoin would truly be complete without white noise, misinformation and shitty math pulled out of someone's ass?  
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:28:41
People keep saying as it grows that will make it less volatile.  What principle, economic or otherwise, is the source of this idea?  I think it's an idea pulled from the ether of wishful thinking with no basis in reality.  There are large bubble and small bubbles, large crashes and small crashes.   Furthermore, you talk of people using Bitcoins as investment and savings.   Currency's primary use is as a medium of exchange, not an investment vehicle or savings.  Stable valuation is a key component of a medium of exchange.  
Additionally, yes, I think the value Gold is volatile.  And you are mistaken in saying the price of gold has remained the same over the past 30 years.  It has went up like 500% in the past decade, how is that 'practically stayed the same?'
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:24:28
Wouldn't a larger economy just attract larger speculators?  
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:06:14
I'm new here and still learning, this is what I pointed out elsewhere, please help with my circa 2011 misconceptions: His primary criticism was that Bitcoins have INSANE day-to-day fluctuations in value(I have no idea, but since no one is refuting I will assume that this is true and his numbers were legit). Not just fluctuations, the numbers he was saying were INSANE. Who would want a "currency" that could lose half it's value while you're taking a nap? Speculation is fine I suppose, but this isn't billed as a vehicle for speculation it is being advertised as a currency. Other than bashing Colbert and his guest's spot on bitcoin I haven't see anyone refute the claim that Bitcoin will be beholden to speculators and manipulation and permanently be cursed with wild volatility making it a poor choice for "currency" in any traditional sense. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:54:45
Among differences between BTC and USD are that the USD is backed by full faith and credit of the US Government(whatever you think that's worth, but it's more than nothing) furthermore and perhaps more importantly is that you are required to pay taxes under penalty of the law and the only accepted form of currency is USD(see split tally sticks for interesting story on how taxes give currency value).  Neither of these scenarios seem to be in the future of BTC.   
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:56:26
Nothing I have seen in my cursory research or the comments here has shown the bitcoin has any protection against bubbles, speculation and extreme volatility.   The only arguments, so far, are that some mysterious time the future the dynamics will somehow change and the threat of a bubble will magically disappear.   That is an absurd notion.  That's like saying housing prices will never collapse because the market is so big.  There have been several huge bubbles in the financial world in the past few decades and those are in much more regulated and stable environments than Bitcoin.  
Wild volatility and bubbles can be a a fun exciting ride for speculators, but why the fuck would a non-speculator ever want that in a currency?  How could a business plan around using bitcoin when the stability of the currency is always under threat?  If my only goal is to wake up with as much cash as I went to sleep with why would I want to use Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:28:48
Sounds like Bitcoin needs the exact sort of centralized banking structure Bitcoin is supposed to be opposed to...just saying.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:33:28
Why are none of the defenders addressing his primary criticism?  That it has WILD day-to-day fluctuations in value(which I assume is true since no one is refuting that fact).  I see all sorts of attacks and people writing off the interview...but no one answering to this?   P.S. I'm new and interested.  Not trying to be provocative, just skeptical. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:31:11
Why is wild volatility just "growing pains and speed bumps" as opposed to a permanent condition?  What would happen in the future that would prevent volatility that is not happening now?
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:36:07
How does that prevent manipulation/speculation/volatility?
