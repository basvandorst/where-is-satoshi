But only until about 5% of them do... ? 61% of government workers can probably stop working and afford to just sit at home to death... Until a percentage of them do.

Now make it look like a homeless person holding a sign and standing in the crosswalk:  Your position is based on which line of cars is fanciest and willing to let you have some money. Because it's all about position, right? Free money just for being in a place at a time? not labor, not a game, not a useful movement of human culture, just pushing a button and getting paid. Fun game you humans are playing.

And Bluetooth vibrators to let them know each payment was received?

DOLLAR: Don't Our Labors Lack A Realism?
@_date: 2019-10-03 06:28:01
Seems to me that "money" comes from scamming each other.  I don't see opportunity in a way that is non destructive or within my reach. I'd like to just have a job that I don't need to sue to keep it. I'm never going to be able to fake friendliness to run a business and constantly have to negotiate my financial security by paying people to argue about money. it's stupid, i just want to do labor, and not almost die everyday for a few years..

The purpose of cryptocurrency is to automate and replace the elaborate jobs program of tax collection and take the power of financial violence away from "authorities". Satoshi will not shit on the floor so a group of laborers with mops can keep pretending to have real jobs.

Well what did they expect? They define value using the size and color of themselves. They all believe Deflation is Genocide and Devaluation is cultural theft. They just can't get anything done without having some war about it.
Lets be real here... Those coins would NEVER be seen marching together if they had any respectable VALUE.

It was a long rocky slide downhill. The radiator cap loss happened on my way to a new years party. If 2005, Jan 1st is my time travel day, i will buy a new cap in the morning instead of trying to drive home. but yeah, all true over a time span that has sucked for everyone.
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:23:11
I would NOT forget the radiator cap on the side of the road, so i don't blow the engine, and lose my car, and job, and access to college, and place to live. That way, I would have money to build mining rigs as they become available. Instead of being homeless for ten years.

nah, there's like hundreds of spots I could reorganize from. The art of surviving fuck-ups in life is the ergonomics you learn from poverty. I'm SO good at being poor these days.

Governments do not have human resources needed to distribute financial stability to their civilians to promote health and prosperity in the form of a paycheck, because banks cannot afford to hire enough "trust" "worthy" people to cash those paychecks, and the paper creating  businesses will not keep up with the demand for mailing out pieces of paper to allow the civilians to have a basic standard of life and prosperity...
BITCOIN FIXES THIS 
^(you stupid little humans.)
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:36:29
but we are fixing to fix that as soon as we fix the vote fixing so we can vote on fixing the fix . That's going to cost money though. Anyone got a fix for that?

This space is actually a parallel... uuh, like a raid array, or backup copy of the reality just outside the original bitcoin, we are using human culture to produce rap lyrics as seed words to brute force our way out, from outside the secondary inside of the blockchain reality. Economics is getting weird.

This is why BTC is a prototype. I'm not concerned.   You want faster horses, its not the same as wanting a car.

Capitalism is a worldwide game of Hungry Hungry Hippos and Bitcoin is how we label all the balls so we can ACTUALLY keep score.  Dollar is just an outdated cheat mechanism, Blockchain is just a firmware upgrade to our game play score keeping mechanics.

If you own bitcoin and have never heard of the Zeitgeist films.... That's weird. Yes, it's dramatic and spooky language conspiracy theoryesque, but if there isn't a movie with bad guys, nobody will care. Spoon-feed your selfie-appendage.

1. ban synthetic materials for clothing.
2. American cotton farmers can sell enough for clothing to stay in business, rather than cotton for money-paper.
3. no longer need Govt'  subsidies in the form of money hole filling to utilize cotton surplus.
4. Factory workers at money printing plant can afford cotton clothing, overtime is relaxed.
5. Hole diggers become professional sand castle builders to entertain cotton wearers at the beach. 
6. nobody at the beach is concerned about the economy... SOLVED.
