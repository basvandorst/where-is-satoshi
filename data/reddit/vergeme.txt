It's OPTIONAL. You can choose not to use antivirus and the update is optional. It's not the OS that's deleting Tor, it's the antivirus program.
And they cleared did everything in secret... by consulting the Tor developer before issuing the patch. What's the alternative? Not removing the botnet?

When you choose to use Antivirus Software, you likely gave consent for it to remove software/files on your behave. In this case, the antivirus software is doing what it's suppose to do.
Alternatively, you can choose not to use Microsoft's antivirus software...
The users clearly have a choice in this scenario.

The default antivirus that ships with Windows can be disabled. You have the option of not using it.
Before you get your pitch fork out, are you not satisfied with the way the security team handled this situation?
1. They only deleted an out of date Tor client with known security flaws
2. The Tor client was installed by the malware, not by the user
3. The Tor development team was consulted prior to updating the virus definition

In this case, the version of Tor removed is an extremely outdated version with known security risk. Plus, Tor developer were consulted prior to updating the definition.
Antivirus software by definition removes files/programs on the user's behave. If this behavior is not something people want, they have the option to not use the antivirus.
Users have a few choices here:
1. If users want the benefits of security/antivirus software, then they should adjust their expectation that files/programs might get quarantined.
2. Alternatively, users can choose to use security/antivirus software from other vendors
3. Not use any security/antivirus software
How is Microsoft doing something it shouldn't be doing here?
