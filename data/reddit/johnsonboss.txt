Moving the decimal point isn't just like printing more money. 
It's the exact same concept as taking $1.00 out of the US and putting in 100 pennies. There's no added money actually in the system, it's just accessible in smaller numbers so everyone can use/access it as is appropriate to their current need.

Wouldn't this be true only if it wasn't so easy to break down Bitcoin into much smaller denominations. As it can already be broken up into .00000001 (don't count the zeros), the amount of money one entire coin long term is worth isn't relevant in your argument.

This is kind of what I was imagining, I was just hoping to stimulate some meaningful conversation to see how some attempt to evaluate what the real value is long term.

This makes sense. Thanks for this guys. I actually didn't realize those services made all this that easy for the business. 
Excited to be in the game now!

Fair enough.

Do you mind explaining how you actually arrived at this number?

Just started loading for me again.

I currently use Coinbase to buy and store my bitcoins. 
Should I actually be backing up those by this method as well?

How did you arrive at that number exactly?

Let's not consider this as 21 million Bitcoin. 
Let's look at it as one big ambiguous lump of treasure. In one big pile, only one person can own it.
But if you split the pile into 2, now two people can own it. There's no more treasure than there was originally, it's just available to two separate parties because it's a piece of the original full treasure.
Same concept applies to Bitcoin. 
Feel free to try to poke holes in that logic if you can.
I agree long term it can be odd to think of 1 BTC being worth so much more than 1 of any other traditional currency. As the value grows, I see a full BTC being thought of as a thousand dollar bill, and the other smaller denominations having more standard names. This has already started with mBTCs, uBTCs, and Satoshi's (the current smallest denomination). Getting this system easily understood by an average person will be extremely important with getting more people to adopt BTC as the value increases.
