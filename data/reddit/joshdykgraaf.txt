They'll be with new edition of yBitcoin which also printing right now. The first place they'll appear is at Consensus, then most of the major crypto events and some of the big fintech ones \(Money2020 EU &amp; US, SXSW\)

Thanks! Yep I made it. Two factors there - that list has been quite volatile while I've been working on this. The other is obtaining high quality versions of logo files to I can translate them into 3D illustrations. Many companies didn't respond, especially the various tokens and ICOs. 
There's a good 15-20 extra companies I wanted to include that I couldn't get the files for. The alternative was burning days making them from scratch.

This was commissioned work, so I'll to look into this. Definitely quite a few people asking about it. If I get a positive response I'll hit you back here.

Yeah I'm interested to see the feedback this gets. The landscape is so convoluted now \- I know for sure I will have missed some companies and projects. Another factor was who responded to my requests for their logo files. There are 15\-20 projects I wanted to include but couldn't get more than a web png of their logo.
As far as ICOs go, I tried to  make a judgement call on how likely they were to be around in 12 months.

Ha! You guys got a better building to go with your improved logo though ;\) 
@_date: 2018-05-03 01:38:17
Thanks! Mostly Photoshop and Cinema 4D, my specialist area is photo\-manipulation \(most of the buildings are based on photos, manipulated into isometric perspective\)

This web version probably won't print well past A4, but I've made the image to be printed basically floor\-to\-ceiling for conferences at 150dpi \(ie still sharp\). The printed posters are looking great.

Just to the right of the stadium

Thanks for this. Definitely going to make this happen for the next one. Getting a bunch of hatemail from butthurt people for not putting their companies I'd never heard of on there.
A few genuine ones I've missed though that will be on the next edition. Others whose logos I couldn't get a high quality version of.

For better or worse, Ver and co are a significant part/factor in the space. 
Took quite a bit to bring myself to put Bitcoin Cash on there...

I'd have to look into this as this was commissioned work. The free version that's going out is 28"x 21" \(71.5 x 53cm\) so not in\-substantial. I'm going to put a copy about double those dimensions up in my office.

AskFM are partnered with a few companies on the map and generally have a strong pro\-blockchain stance in their various outlets. 
Abra is a crypto investment platform.
ANX are a Blockchain solutions/service provider, they are quite influential in east Asia.

Broadly speaking, a larger building generally denotes a more influential/better funded company in its respective area. A good example of this is BitPay among the payment processors \- the  volumes they are processing vastly dwarfs their competitors. Though that sector is so small aside from BitPay that I considered removing it for this poster. 
That's not always true though \- it's hard to find information for many companies.  
Certain sectors \(ICOs, miners, exchanges, enterprise\) got larger buildings across the board to underline their greater influence in the ecosystem. 
An important disclaimer is that a handful of companies sponsored the poster, which funded the large run of free prints \(120,000\+\) and paid for my time, allowing me to put so many hours into it for a more polished result.

So you deleted your comment about your coin not being on there and post again with salt.

Directly below the title moon sign.

We approached about 190 different companies for permission to use their logo in the graphic, the ones who appear on the graphic are the ones who responded and gave us a useable copy of their logo. A couple specifically denied us usage because they had problems with their logo appearing in this kind of light-hearted way. 
There are several major omissions that I really wish were there.

No you don't. 
After this was released, yBitcoin made a front cover that people paid to be on. It's a free mag, it needs to be paid for somehow.
Because this was so popular, I'm working with the yBitcoin guys to do a print run of 80,000 free posters of it that will be distributed at Bitcoin events, SXSW, CES and Money2020. It will be bigger, in a wider format with more companies. To cover the costs, we are offering to let companies have customised buildings and prominent positions. Every company that gave us permission to use their logo will still be there (including some new ones that only responded after the initial release).

Hahaha I wish I'd thought of that (I made the graphic).
