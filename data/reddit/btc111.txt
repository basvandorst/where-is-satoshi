Something does need to change. There's a real potential for a nation-state to perform a 51% attack. I've argued this on BitcoinTalk.org (username BitcoinAuthor) 
Need to remember, Dan is no clown.
** That could happen. But it hasn't happened yet, so there's still an attack vector.**

Check out quantabytes link. Looks like Jeff Garzik has a bet set up already.

There *is* a concentration of power: In the Yifu Guo (Avalon) talk for Bitcoin 2013, he describes how, at one point, he was holding 25% of the hashing power on a tray. Imagine what a country could do!
What's alarmist? The algorithm gets changed, and the problem is fixed.

What makes it ridiculous? And why's it irresponsible? He's one of the most high-profile hackers in the world, and was the Director of Penetration Testing at Cisco. He also outed the  Sony Rootkit.
Large prediction, yes. Ridiculous, no way!

I don't think he was looking for an "out". Why would he want an out if he believes it's going to happen.

You're guessing his probability of being right is small, but he has different information from you, and so it may be higher than you think.

At the Developer's Roundtable there's a discussion about doing a hard fork every 6 months:


You just made "1% chance of being correct" up. Which data did you use to find 1%? He could be correct. You just *think* he's wrong.

A scrypt proof-of-work couldn't be done well by ASICs.

He did it on Twitter.

Do it. He would probably take you up on the offer! And then post it to the sub.

I missed the part where you gave the reason *why* he is incorrect?
And if he's correct he'll gain more credibility -- which he got from being able to understand systems better than most.
