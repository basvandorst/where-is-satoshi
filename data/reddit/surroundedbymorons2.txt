Big blocks = centralized Bitcoin. Datacenter nodes = Simon Dixon's wet dream. What part of this you don't get dumbo? It's almost 2016, still going for BIP101 makes you a laughing stock at this point. XTrolls are hilarious.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:32:54
Dumbest shit I've read today, specially this:
"Jamie Dimon still says Bitcoin will fail"
Of course he says so, because Bitcoin is a direct competitor against the status quo in which he resides at the top. Of course, he will start liking Bitcoin if blocks are big enough that they can control the nodes, something that big block proposers fail to realize (unless they have an agenda in which they benefit from such situation) but then again, I don't expect a big blocker to have any wit.
You and the people like you are the cancer of this project. We will never let turn Bitcoin into an R3 approved tool, deal with it and fork yourself.
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:35:15
You are kidding me right
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:29:13
I would offer you some, but the koolaid supply has been depleted for the next 100 years thanks to the Classic guys.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:10:14
You are one of those casuals that just whines "BIGGER BLOCK SIZE NANANA" while sticking his index fingers on their ears.
Listen, there's no way to know for a fact when is the right time to hard fork for a bigger block size, because we don't have  fucking magic 8 balls over there buddy. So how are we going to say "THIS day 2MB, then this other day 4MB, then this other day 8MB" as if we know shit about the future.
So when it's time to raise the blocksize? When we can guarantee that the average computer on people's bedrooms can still run a node. What are those minimal specs to run a node? I have no idea, and research should be pointed here. We need some sort of standard of minimum ISP and computer requirements to run a node. People should be able to run nodes on their offices, bedrooms, or mom's basements. Right now, doubling the rate the blocksize grows at, I think would be too much, specially without any research. We can deal with it for a while. I mean the system works, pay the required fee (all wallets should be able to guess the right required fee automatically btw).
So when this "minimum requeriment standard" is raised as hardware becomes cheaper, THEN it would be a fair time to raise the blocksize. Right now we are blindfolded about this, so we might as well stay at 1MB+segwit and continue researching and planning.
Notice how there's no artificial market fee: The fees we are paying (sightly higher) are worth the extra research and planning to do things the right way, there's always a tradeoff and this is the tradeoff.
You can either do this, or pull a Toomin, hard fork tomorrow to 2MB and smoke a joint.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:11:29
Something worth risking a hard fork + losing the actual talent here (Core devs) for.
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:54:31


I know how open source works, and I know those guys are talentless oportunist hacks compared to the Core dev team.
I just can't stand how obvious the fact that this is just a power grab backed by developers and companies from Blockchain Alliance trying to decrease the influence of cypherpunks to convert Bitcoin into a fancier Paypal 2.0
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:50:47
Notice how big blockers hate on LN's team and call them vaporwarers, while this guy's opinion is perfectly ok even if Zerocash is actual vaporware.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:53:21
Another big blocker idiot bites the dust and reveals itself as the cancer he is.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:29:34
I like how you've fixated on Blythe's photoshoped face because you fail to make even a single reasoned statement to discredit the content on that image.
The CORE of Bitcoin is supposed to emulate Tor, not some fucking fancy payment processor, get this through your skull doofus. No one is going to care about using Bitcoin on-chain features to pay for their frappuccinos because we already have... Paypal. 
We can do that as safe and decentralized through a layer (LN). Learn how2scale maggot.
There's no problem in keeping a conservative block size so people can run nodes on their bedroom computers. All of the massive traffic will be done off-chain through LN anyway, so not wanting to keep the core of Bitcoin as decentralized as possible defeats the point. 
Precisely because mining is so centralized, we must guarantee that nodes don't end up the same. Jesus Christ you are dense. Just leave.
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:14:31
Is this how you cope?
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:49:23
Bitcoin works as good as ever, just pay the recommended fee. 
Stop crying about it, we are not risking a hard fork and contributing to node centralization because you don't want to pay a still cheap-as-fuck fee and are impatient to wait until LN can deal with all the spam transactions in a cheap and instant way.
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:09:46
So Crapssic lifespan has been even shorter than XTrojan? actually sad.

@_date: 2016-01-26 14:41:51
Anyone wanting to fire the Core devs to put those bro-coder amateurs in place needs to visit a doctor, no exaggeration. I can't believe how clueless those guys sound compared to Greg Maxwell. I mean LOL.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:05:51
How are Core devs "doing nothing".
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:22:42
Core devs working on solid stuff while Classic shills hope to copy-paste their hard work. Can't wait for the update.
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:43:27
And idiots shill Bitcoin Classic on Reddit.
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:53:15
We already have enough time until LN thanks to SegWitness. No need to force a hard fork and centralize nodes. Don't fall for the FUD (FUD being Classic and so on).
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:35:23
There's also the fact that Core devs have the talent while the hard forkers have doofuses like Toomin Tunes. No thanks, not going to bet my money on those amateurs.
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:08:58
A Classic in a power-grab attempt, even more subtle and evil than XT. Fucking pathetic.
Anyone supporting this is either uninformed or has an agenda.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:43:06
Why he would do this? Don't understand yet that Mike Hearn is a member of R3 and a bankster's bitch? Don't you see what motive big blockers have yet? Get with the program.
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:28:46


You are right. This is exactly why we need Bitcoin to be as decentralized as possible, and nodes to be as spread as possible, in other words, this is exactly why we need small blocks that allow for 1 person to run 1 node forever, as well as increased privacy (native Tor support, CT, every transaction mixed by default). This is also exactly why big blockers with agendas such as Mike Hearn are getting paid by R3 to inject trojan horses within the community (XT). Do the fucking math, it's 2016.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:20:27
Just considering the fact that the blockchain would grow 4 times faster... I don't think the average user can deal with such level of growth right now. In the future? Sure, but right now seems overkill to me. We would see node centralization tendencies with 2MB right now, let alone 4. Just imagine if you went full Gavin/Hearn at 8 or 20MB... lol.
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:57:48
Clint Eastwood would shoot your ass for trying to use him to shill Classic.

A bunch of amateurs, just like the XT crap. It's basically Litecoin. This is pure madness.
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:34:01
Glad to see you active again in the forums. I mean compare this guy's speech with the Toomin morons, or pretty much any pro-classic tools. Just no competition to be seen here.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:26:53
What the fuck are you talking about. Just stop.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:37:45
This is exactly how a clueless Crapssic-koolaid drinking amateur looks like. You got BTFO, go study so next time they come up with another fantastic hard fork proposal to centralize nodes you don't fall under the same trap.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:12:41
But who was monopolies? Right now anyone can still start mining with their computer, so fucking what. 
It's all about not breaking certain thresholds, which raising the block size (right now) does, that's why a conservative one is preferred. If you can't run a node in your bedroom, it's over, it's finished, please understand this and go do something productive.

They are too busy developing actually useful stuff like SegWit and Confidential Transactions to be replying to shitposters 24/7.
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:13:14
The only thing that doesn't exist is Classic's code and your brain.
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:55:41
A classic cope by big blockers is ignoring the fact that having a million nodes is irrelevant if those nodes aren't:
1) Spread across the globe
2) Run by different entities (ideal, 1 node = 1 individual).
Have fun trying to achieve that with bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:38:49
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:03:20
Is this how you cope?
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:01:33
The forkers are hoping to keep copy pasting Core's code because they aren't bright enough to keep developing it themselves, yet you act as if Core devs shouldn't have a priority. Fucking-fantastic.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:57:01


@_date: 2016-01-23 22:00:20


Poor reading comprehension is a recurring big-blocker trait.
As the picture said, corporations running a million nodes doesn't increase security since it's not only about the number of nodes, but how independent and spread across the globe they are from each other (even if a corporation managed to spread nodes across the globe somehow, it would still be shit since they aren't run by individual entities).
Get another hobby, you are finished here.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:03:48
Most legit post I've seen on this website. Unfortunately, the majority of an audience is always the most uninformed and malleable. Big blocks and cheaper fees is easier to sell than decentralized nodes.
A lot of people just want to see the "1" MB number be higher out of autism at this point, they don't even grasp the details.
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:08:22
Cool, let's have a bunch of amateurs and anti-cypherpunk-anti-decentralization-agenda-driven people run the full node as Core devs quit because they get fed up (so no more copy-pasting from them), guaranteeing in a matter of years the nodes end up as centralized as mining is now so Bitcoin can become TPTB's bitch. 
Let's also guarantee the devs become increasingly anti-privacy as well in a smooth way so people don't realize it's even happening. But at least I can buy my frappuccinos on-chain with a cheaper fee.
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:22:41
No, all im saying is, I would rather have my money bet in a group of people that has demonstrated their value for years and have roots in pro-privacy stuff, and understand how important is that random people can run nodes on their bedrooms, than the opposite.
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:33:48
Bitcoin Classic within itself as a meme.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:06:07
There's no point in listening to a bunch of idiots that want to risk an unnecessary hard fork to unnecessarily raise the block size centralizing nodes when they are already low at 5000 right now out of autism.
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:18:30
Absolutely. You are insane if you don't think what Bitcoin offers isn't worth paying $1 for, but then again, by then LN will be operative and dealing with big volume of transactions without the dumb idea of centralizing nodes of the core just to pay smaller fees on on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:54:51
That doesn't matter. To the average bro "Classic" is just Classic, they have no idea that everything works thanks to Core. If they knew, no one with a functional brain would put their money on a lesser developer team to develop the full node.
@_date: 2016-02-17 02:15:26
Absolutely fucking lol at the butthurt downvoting brigade.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:56:06
Tell me when anyone in the classic team is talented enough to come up with CT, segwit, libsec2561k, sidechains... (actual useful stuff). Until then you are wasting my time and anyone going for classic needs to find a new hobby.

Turn down for BTC. ETH bagholders getting rekt, no joke. I can't wait for side-chains, it's going to be a game changer. We'll see how things are going for alts in 2 years.
@_date: 2016-02-06 12:29:29
Why? It's a good idea. Given the fact that the only team that can realistically keep developing the full node is the Core team, and given the fact that the hard fork opportunists live by the assumption that the Core team will keep releasing updates so they opportunist hard fork team (in this case "Classic") can keep copy-pasting the code... there's no reason to put your money on such an abortion that is destined to never get pretty far without the Core team.
@_date: 2016-02-06 20:42:42
Bitcoin Core devs are human and they can get tired of the bullshit.
If the Tooministas win im dumping my BTC, I don't want to be part of a project run by amateur opportunists.

You are overrating the average end user. No one knows shit about how Paypal or banking works, no one will know shit about Bitcoin except us that are into it, they will just use it. Normal people don't give a fuck, they just get shit done, they want to get paid and buy, get some perspective.

@_date: 2016-02-10 18:49:16
That sound's like a generic advertisement for a shitty product, pretty fitting for Classic, easy to sell to uninformed bro-coders.
@_date: 2016-02-06 12:27:05
Core is too busy making actual features (SegWit, CT, side-chains), so no time to try to gain the low IQ populace acceptance by proposing constant hard forks for unneeded block size increases while not explaining the tradeoffs of doing so.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:47:44
If Classic is not something, it's wisdom teeth, since replacing the talented dev team (Core, with their contributions such as CT, SegWit and sidechains) with a bunch of opportunistic morons (Classic), it's the opposite of wisdom.
@_date: 2015-11-13 04:07:20
This is why XT is death and so are big blocks. If this bitch could choose, would she prefer Bitcoin with centralized nodes, or Bitcoin with nodes all over the planet because an average computer can run one? 
The biggest defense is being spread.
Bitcoin is supposed to be like Tor. Bitcoin is supposed to be as decentralized as possible. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:09:27
It's a challenge when dealing with "let's just make huge blocks dude" people but I will try.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:39:58
Not "for some reason" but because BIP101 is delusional and assumes bandwidth will catch up with its magical prediction. By 2032 no one will bother with running nodes, certainly not me the average dude with the average computer which already suffers a bit with the Core client (ram intensive and bandwith).
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:39:34
Good. Anyone against one of the core principles of Bitcoin (decentralized nodes) should be banned on sight.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:48:35
So XT.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:44:56
They are under the same agenda, which is mainly to centralize nodes.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:31:21
The only thing that chart implies is BIP101 solves shit nothing. By 2032, Visa's ts/ps will dwarf Bitcoin, and datacenters will be making bank off running nodes, which makes Bitcoin pretty pointless. Again, stop dreaming for global on-transactions without the (non negotiable) trade off of giving up to the vision of a decentralized system. You are as delusional as it gets if you think "Moore's Law" will allow the average guy such as me, with an average computer, to run it's own node just like im doing now, by then.
LN is just clever usage of Bitcoin script and those people are the people that give us actual hope of Bitcoin ever taking over the world. Thinking big blocks alone will solve the problem is a cop out.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:35:55
Who cares about banks. They will never deliver the special features that Bitcoin has (if indeed it doesn't get ruined by Google Datacenter(tm) nodes) which is mainly being censorship resistant.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:50:45
The idea of taking over the world is attractive and must be pursued, but keeping decentralization of nodes, that's the whole point of stuff like LN.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:49:12
This is exactly what Blythe Masters, Jamie Dixon and all those dickheads want: A centralized Bitcoin where they have clear targets as miners AND clear targets as nodes. Good job at anyone that's drinking the XT coolaid.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:36:29
If you are interested in Bitcoin you are anti XT and BIP101 nonsense, because it goes against what the whitepaper said.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:47:25
LN offers scaling with decentralization on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:47:21
8x is shit nothing. We are getting nowhere without LN, stop thinking about mass adoption without it, so the trade off is not good enough to give away decentralization for. Im ok with bigger blocks, but not with BIP101 or other XT nonsense.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:06:12
NOT TO MENTION: Notice how it says it would take us until 2032 to reach the CURRENT ts/ps of Visa. LOL. Such blocksize increase is futile and will only centralize Bitcoin, this is a fact. We aren't getting nowhere without LN. Get a grip.

You are just playing the pessimistic"-realistic" card in fear of appearing an idiot if you claim an higher price.
What some people don't seem to get is this is either 6 figure+ a Bitcoin or death. There are only 21 million (- the ones that are lost forever). All the other cryptocurrencies will get assimilated by this black hole called Bitcoin. Even Ethereum may potentially switch to BTC. The potential of growth for this marketcap is on the trillions if everthing goes as planned. Sidechains will open unknown unknowns in terms of what's possible to do. In 10 years things will be Very different.
1 Bitcoin = 1 Berkshire Hathaway type A. 1 piece of land in the most important protocol since TCP/IP. You guys are fucking insane by claiming 1K "was it". You aren't seeing the big picture. Your brain is tricking you. Human brains aren't wired to think Bitcoin would ever reach 1 dollar (source, I was there back in the day, I have IRC logs of people saying I was a schizo by claiming it would surpass the dollar). Similarly, it isn't ready to think it can reach 1 million.
