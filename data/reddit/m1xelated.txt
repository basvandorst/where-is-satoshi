tldr: code is under git version control and hosted on github, there are a couple people that can merge code in (validated through a signature). There is no direct deploy. Miners and Users just have to choose which software they would like to run (so they are the ones pulling the code and deploying). Anyone can contribute code/introduce a proposal (also known as BIP). These are then discussed by other devs.
You can find the list of things people are working on/requested to work on (on github we call them issues) here: [

Large funds can buy tether directly from tether/pre authorizing a mint. They probably have collateralized it into a ratio between ex(0.7 and 0.75) and when the ratio gets too high they print new tether.  Think about this. If they wouldn’t print new tether and they would have more assets it wouldn’t make sense either.  How can they serve demand without reprinting? 
I agree that the fractional reserve banking model is bad but most people here don’t understand how minting works.

Or perhaps there was more demand for usdt as many people want to get in before the 12k crossover causing them to print more?

yes: buy an amazon giftcard with your prepard creditcard it on US/UK/JPY Amazon and then use [purse.io]( to buy other people stuff on amazon in exchange for BTC / downside is it will cost you prob around 20% for first trades. Depending on the card you have you could also try localbitcoins or paxful

Be careful what you wish for. Complete countries will be ruined by this and a huge part of the economy will be wiped out. Some people would love to see the world burn as long as it’s benefits them. Yes it does strengthen the bitcoin store of value concept but I don’t think you understand the full impact of this narrative.

You could not be more wrong. 1/6th of gold supply is held by the bank and IMF. Gold going down in value will affect the fractional reserve of banks, devaluing the currency (meaning banks will print more money/money will be worth less). The regular working people will be affected by this. It is never the banks or governments that take the hit, it is always the people. Gold is not just an accounting system, it is a highly leveraged asset that affects all major currencies.
