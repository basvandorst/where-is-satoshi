Not sure what you refer to, but "Bitcoin 9000" is not a name for a fork of the existing project, but a name for the plan, basically a BIP.  It is compatible with the existing SegWit proposal and with hard fork proposals to raise the base block limit (although, the whole point of our proposal is to actually solve security and scalability issues without wasting time on hard fork debate).

Sorry for the direct link to PDF.  Here is the abstract:
We propose a strategy to scale Bitcoin to a far greater throughput and performance than available today while keeping the risk of centralization and costs to a minimum. To achieve this we decrease block validation latency with diff blocks, parallelize transaction validation, enable UTXO sharding with transaction input block height annotations, and deploy a series of extension blocks for sustainable capacity increases.

Sorry, I forgot to mention this point in the paper.  Each block commits to its corresponding diff block contents (merkle root of added/removed txs + previous diff block reference).  So if you mine an empty difference with the same diff block's previous hash, then you effectively fork (fan out) the diff block chain with every incomplete PoW.  That's not a problem for others since they may keep on extending some diff block chain without worrying about that.  But it might be a problem for you when other nodes find a block - you'd spend extra time downloading and verifying all transactions that you missed.
