majority of people still dont know how to export private keys, use paper wallets etc. So if their HDD dies.. poof!

Its another factor to take into account when speculating on price... not everyone mines. More people trade, so any info which could influence trading strategy is useful.

nope. the payout for BTC was fixed at: 1BTC = USD483 = JPY50,058.12.
At this point, everyones claim is calculated in JPY. if they do pay out in BTC, it'll be based on the JPY value of the claim, not by how many BTC were lost.

You need a list of addresses from gox to be able to do this properly... which isnt available. There are a few lists floating round but without having access to GOX, or them publishing a list of addresses its pretty hard.
The general feeling is that the best way to explain what happened is that the user DB was manipulated to increase balances and those were withdrawn in either fiat or BTC. 
If there's criminal investigations going on in the background after anomalies have been spotted after trawling though the trade logs, thats a pretty good reason not to release a list of addresses as it could hinder the investigation.
Best thing to hope for is that manipulated accounts in the user DB are still present that have high balances, which wont be claimed because they're fabricated, meaning the pot of 200,000 actually goes to those with genuine balances. and the actual figure of *lost* coins isn't actually as high as 850,000.
Hopefully more info into what happened will be revealed at the creditor meeting.

considering her IT team cant even secure an email server, I can see this going really well.

Export the private key. print the export. keep it somewhere safe (anyone who has your private key, can get access to that address, and any balance on it).
You can import the private key and regain control of that address in the future if needs be. 
Practice the procedure with a dummy address so you are familiar with the process.. a quick google will explain how to do the export\import on the client you're using.  
(backup your wallet before doing anything!)

plus a paper wallet, stored securely in case your PC goes pop. 
I learned this the hard way.

British too though, so that doesn't really prove much.
