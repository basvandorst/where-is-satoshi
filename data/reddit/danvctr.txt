I don't understand why everyone keeps calling it an attack... From my understanding BCH solves most of the problems with BTC right now, right?

Sorry if I'm dull, but I want to understand why everyone is so upset.
How can you tell 125k BCH were created before their time? And "before their time" in comparison to what schedule?

Thank you for some explanation. I wasn't aware of the manipulation of the market surrounding BCH, when it's put that way it definitely seems suspicious.

Sure, but if Uber's goal was to provide accessible rides to everyone, then Sobers get the short end because Drunks want more Beer (not sure I followed your analogy completely)

OK, so because the BCH difficulty is lower, more blocks (= more coins) have been mined than BTC. That would theoretically create an oversupply of BCH vs BTC, I get that now. Maybe I'm wrong, but if you want to incentivise miners to switch to the chain that (at least in their mind) is superior, you need to make it more likely that each miner will get paid, which means increasing the mining speed of coins.

The "tax" you're referring to is the loss in purchasing power of the holders of BCH as more coins are mined, correct? If so, that makes sense. Also, if I understand your viewpoint, you believe relatively higher transaction fees are acceptable (because they lure in miners) at the cost of accessibility to BTC for the "average person".

I submitted a transaction with a ~$20 fee on Saturday night and it didn't get included into a block until late Monday morning.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:53:55
How much did you pay in fees? That had to be close to $12 per transaction, yeah?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:19:51
I mean, we're both talking anecdotally. I believe that may have been true for you, but I also sent a transaction fron my Electrum wallet on Saturday night with a $12 fee and it wasn't in a block until late Monday morning.

You have evidence of BCH buyers bribing bitcoin miners?
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:57:38
To my knowledge there aren't many exchanges, if any at all, that will accept a credit card in exchange for Bitcoins because the purchaser has the ability to dispute/reverse the charge, while Bitcoin transactions are always final.
That said, if someone knows differently I'd love to be proven wrong.
