are private keys still in your exclusive possession? did you set the second exit password? if they do not respond to the ticket, try to post them on their Twitter account

even most of the extraction of gold and rare metals is in China. And this is because they exploit human beings and unscrupulous technological resources and not because they are either rich in gold or otherwise. I think they can not do otherwise. that when they move away from mining they would make it much easier and more palatable for others with more rules

Hello everyone. Would it be possible to transform LN into an advanced smart contract platform? Would be public, free and would offer the BTC everything that was taken away in market shares and would help raise the price
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:54:30
we must be honest. Technical structure and IT characteristics are not enough. Unless you care about the price you want to see the bitcoin come back to being a nerd thing, you have to admit that marketing is also important. on this the Altcoins, much less decentralized, teach us so much. look eth, took only one feature of the bitcoin and developed it with Dapp and when he realized that the price rises with speculative interest of investors, especially large, first promised the fork of eth zero to levitate the price, then when not was able to maintain them announced the transition to pos, true Ponzi scheme, where the coins are generated by themselves. if the price of BTC is important, it needs a marketing team. I work in research and development, it is also with the best brains there is need of someone looking for capital to make them work on the projects.

the price of the bitcoin needs a perennial fork. I only have bitcoins and I believe a lot in it, there is nothing that has its potential and it is the only truly decentralized one. but we must say that who manages the altcoin is very good at marketing. we need a sort of annual fork managed for those who keep the btc. perhaps of cryptomonete derivatives with different characteristics. how about?

whenever there is an announcement about a step forward regarding quantum computers, btc collapses.  This time the announcement even involved a Google quantum computer app about passwords .... I think that until there is a quantum resistance protocol the price won't take off ...

if you also have the Paysafecard Mastercard card in addition to the account, you can add it to Coinbase, even if you have to pay two fees, one for the PSC card and the other for Coinbase.  but it is very convenient when the price falls and you want to buy without waiting and without risking putting a credit card ...

Innanzitutto grazie per l'articolo. Sono stato affascinato dal Btc dal 2014 anno in cui sono stato il primo in Italia ad accettarlo per molte transazioni finanziarie,e devo dire che sono stato molto critico in passato per il fatto che, una moneta nata contro le speculazioni bancarie, oggi sia l'asset piu manovrabile al mondo da pochi. Si poteva proporre in modo diverso premiando chi lo deteneva e gli sviluppatori e stabilizzando il prezzo, ma sono stato sempre criticato dai traders puri. Ora la minaccia più importante mi sembravano i quantum computer ma spero che davvero il protocollo si possa aggiornare all'approssimarsi della minaccia. Ancora grazie per il link

surely I expressed myself badly. SegWit and Lightning Network were big steps for the mass adoption of the Btc. But nobody imposed them. From my point of view I see only a young, great revolution, which must defend itself from its enemies. But I think I'm the only one to have this opinion .... :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 09:39:31
if you only used the official wallet to reward perennial fork who holds the btc for at least a year with a series of different coins that use bitcoin blockchain for many uses, it would be more difficult. You can speculate less on what you can not sell for a year or more, compared to what you can sell when you want. All the Btc system would benefit from this situation. In traditional finance we trust a market with measures that aim to preserve good and control speculations. I only say that Bitcoin, which for me may be one of the greatest human revolutions, has provided very powerful weapons, precisely because of its nature, for a mass adoption and fight its enemies, which are the same ones that now make the price.
@_date: 2019-01-27 09:23:28
do not you think that the market would quickly go up if there were more scalability and people would feel like investing in a free market of speculation? All the people I know would like to get more into the Btc market, but they know that just the cash of a few is enough to make the price and the market. If we want a mass adoption, the Btc must present itself different from traditional finance and its speculations. And who better than an encrypted and anti-inflationary currency can do this?
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:59:58
of course we all trade when we buy a good that we want, and we make speculation when we make speculation when we invest in something that we believe can increase in value. But I speak of the few traders influencing the market with great liquidity to manipulate. Is not this a part of which we wanted to get rid of 10 years ago? I only say that the Btc has a decentralized and cryptographic nature that can solve all this better than any traditional finance. I certainly did not say not to buy and sell btc. Only work in contact with speculative finance and I see that the crypto market is very useful for them. Thanks

ok. thanks for the conversation that always allows me to learn and excuse my English :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 08:28:07
I think that if it really wants to be a Digital Gold, Bitcoin must free itself from the influence of the liquidity of a few traders and "blind" those who hold the good. Reward through the official wallet who maintains for at least a year the Btc with other coins with various characteristics based on the blockchain of the Btc and open to various functions, which will be submitted to the market, with perennial forks. This will make Bitcoin the digital reserve of the crypto world, as is the gold for traditional finance, and will free bitcoins from traders who represent one of the problems of speculative finance against which bitcoin was born 10 years ago, making it more scalable and freeing resources for developers and users.

GREAT! I hope the time gives reason to you and to us all! Hello and thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:28:24
wow! congratulations. My problem ... is that I am my employer, and this year I have already lost almost 10 thousand euros! :-(    But I can wait and in any case without risk there is no gain, but it seems strange to me one thing: among the many people I met for work and for my passion for Bitcoin (surely hundreds) there are only people Interested in buying, not selling, but to keep, it will be just a coincidence, but it seems strange to me that even for the most decentralized cryptocurrency there is, the price of Bitcoin is made by very few people who want to trade. : do not you find it wrong? Do you think it's not against the nature and the spirit of Bitcoin, and I can assure you that my work, which in traditional finance is good as gold or diamonds or other strategic assets, is never exchanged without the protection of Holders and these gentlemen make the real economy - no shares of companies that extract or hold gold are ever paid, and never insurance or bond actions without the holders wanting it - do not you think the Bitcoin community should you defend yourself against speculation? Meanwhile, thanks for the clarifications  ..
@_date: 2019-01-13 13:43:11
I agree but only in part. I explain myself. 4 years ago I was the first in Italy to accept Bitcoin for some financial transactions because I believe it could become one of the biggest revolutions in human history. The thing that now scares me is that they are approaching to buy Bitcoin only traders, where they have an easy place and without rules as opposed to the traditional financial world. This seems to me to be the opposite of why Bitcoin was born. From the care of the world of intermediaries and liars of the 2008 crisis to their privileged place. Do not you think something is wrong? Do not you think that the structure of Bitcoin requires to survive this? If Bitcoin wants to oust the financial world, it must use their weapons to protect themselves from them. But of course I can be wrong.....I am still new to this technology compared to many of you.
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:09:42
if Bitcoin really wants to enter the real world and become an alternative to traditional currencies, it must now realize that defense measures typical of traditional finance are necessary. Otherwise it will always remain something only for fans. Very few people can not be allowed to make the price against the majority of those who want to hold. Imagine if finance allowed the price of gold or other strategic assets to be the subject of free speculation without defending the holders. Or if the bonds were treated without defenses by speculation. To avoid that very few people manipulate the price I think that the best way is a perennial fork that prizes the holders of at least a year with coins with various characteristics related to the mother currency, these are suitable for the trade, as insurance premiums or bonds related to gold or diamonds. The ability to defend against speculation is however inherent in bitcoin as a decentralized and cryptographic currency.

if Bitcoin really wants to be a new reality, it must defend its value from the speculation of the orders and the liquidity of the traders, otherwise instead of solving the problems of the banks seen in 2008, it will be only their next victim
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:10:28
totally agree! I am not only sure that finance has every interest in burying the btc which is its natural enemy, but entry into public exchange would also legitimize other currencies to be quoted and pump up their price.
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:23:27
hello to all guys. I would like to ask if in the case of Bitcoin's LN this can be transformed into an evolved smart contract network to run many DAPs and coins on BTC. thank you.
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:37:07
if it comes to rsk mining smart contract and especially if the lightning network also becomes a platform of various applications, the bitcoin summarizes in itself all that they want to do the altcoin. and back to 90%.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:42:47
LN can be a great chance for BTC. Making LN an evolved smart contract and smart data platform can give rise to many Lapp and token on their platform that adapt to what the market demands and remove it from the competition. One could also think of rewarding at the beginning of rewarding Holders with special hard forks of some of these to BTC holders.

pow guarantees security and decentralization. pos and other systems, only banking wear for greedy. how much would diamonds be worth, if instead of extracting them it would be enough to put one next to another to have one? do not trust those who are blinded by greed. leave these things to the banks ....
