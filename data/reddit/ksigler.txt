I meant it as an introduction for people that have a handle on crypto but are unfamiliar with Bitcoins. Coming to Bitcoins, I found most of the intro material to be too dumbed down and outside of that you were reading protocol specifics.

I might have stated it clearer, but I don't say that the miners set the transaction fees. I say that they have "the option of adding in any transactions advertised on the Bitcoin network". Basically the transactions that are added to the block are up to the miner, not the fees.

I debated it and left it out. I was planning a similar thing for transactions and was going to include it there. Now though I think you're right. It belongs here.

indeed. thanks!

ha! you made me google IA v UX. I think we used to just call all of this graphic design. (for others: 
The idea was emulating a lot of young adult science museum displays, pointing out parts of the exhibit and magnifying them with notes.

Totally open to UX feedback too. Thanks!

all the more reason to expand on transactions and include the Merkle Root.

Pretty much what I was going for. A lot of the intros use too many analogies and left me wondering what was really going on technically.

Sure. Open Office Draw format. sorry :/
