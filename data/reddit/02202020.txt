No, that’s not the problem. The problem is that as he begins to sell extremely large amounts, the price of Bitcoin would go down. That’s just the way the markets work.
Also, it’s worthwhile to note that this is Satoshi’s wallet we’re talking about. If even a single satoshi was moved out of his wallet, the price would instantly go down in fear of the 1 million bitcoins being sold

@_date: 2017-12-22 23:40:13
I can’t name the price, but I know sure as hell we haven’t reached the maximum potential.
Here’s the way I see it:
Imagine your workplace (or your neighborhood, school, etc.) Now think: how many people there own Bitcoin?
Now, if we assume Bitcoin’s *true* maximum potential - a cryptocurrency that all 7 billion people use worldwide - we’ll see that there’s an insane amount of growth to still be had.  
I’m no mathematician, but I think that’d be a huge increase. (If you’re really interested in this, you can check out [Metcalfe’s Law)]( 
Now, of course, that’s assuming that Bitcoin even gathers all 7 billion people. And that Bitcoin is able to scale up to that amount. However, the same could be said for any increase in userbase.. and that’s why, until Bitcoin is common, it will still have room to grow. The only time it will stop growing is when it gives a reason for people to leave (maybe transaction fees being too high/network too slow like it is right now..)
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:06
I wouldn’t compare it to that. Lee hasn’t completely ditched the Litecoin scene. He’s still doing exactly what he has always been doing - developing the technologies of Litecoin. 
Satoshi, on the other hand..
He’s done the exact opposite. He’s kept his coin but ditched development.
And nobody can really say whether or not this helped or diminished the crypto community. For all we know, just the presence of Satoshi could have prevented altcoins altogether. But we really can’t know, since it never happened

The data shows otherwise - “If you build a very simple model valuing bitcoin as the square function number of users times the average transaction value, 94% of the bitcoin movement over the past four years is explained by that equation." -Tom Lee, cofounder, FundStrat Global Advisors. He was the first to suggest Metcalfe’s Law applies to Bitcoin not only in theory but by actual data analysis

I think you’re misunderstanding what an attack is. 
An attack isn’t from a single person, group, or entity.
It’s from an entire network (and, as you pointed out, many other factors). In this case Bitcoin Cash is the network.
[This post]( of aantop that reached the front explains it very well. 
If you don’t think Bcash is attacking Bitcoin right now, I suggest you read more articles and look at the price charts
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:55
Not sure I can ease your mind. But I can reassure you that it’s going to correct. This definitely isn’t the first time Bitcoin has done this, and it won’t be the last. Just look to the last bull run to $11k, when it corrected back to $9k.
One thing you can be certain about is that when the price is going to correct, it’ll still be higher than it was before the bull run started. That’s what has always happened with these huge increases, and I haven’t seen anything that would compel me to believe that it’s any different now.
Also, you shouldn’t look at these increases as $1000 increases. Look at them as percent increases. This is, in reality, the same as Bitcoin going from $1.1 to $1.5. It’s not as big as your mind makes it to be, so don’t stress yourself. It’s still huge, but not worryingly huge.

Yup, went back and read it and I think I do. The way you worded it made me think you were calling the formula random numbers


I’ve already addressed this in our DMs, but I’ll bring it up again. The logic behind WHY the price moves the way it does will never change, but the movement of the price itself definitely can change.
Let’s look at MySpace. It was once valued according to Metcalfe’s Law. Eventually, the value started going down - immensely. But that valuation was still always estimated according to Metcalfe’s Law. The price itself didn’t continue, as you say, based on past performance. But the logic behind how it moves did.

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:53:23


Man, you’re making me sound like a broken record, but the answer is NO. You’re the only one saying that. This is begging to become redundant. Nobody in their right minds would believe that it will keep growing at the rate it is forever. 
Past performance isn’t indicative of future results.
Just because the last near decade of Bitcoin looks like it’s exponential, doesn’t mean that it always will. 
Look at Amazon stocks. I could say that the chart looks exponential. By your logic, that means that in the future it will keep rising exponentially? 
You’re assuming that when this growth stops, the only possible way that could be is if it’s through a crash. That’s a complete and utter logical fallacy. You’re completely leaving out the idea that it could simply slow down. 
*The factor that causes Bitcoin to stop its large growth does not have to be a crash.*
Now, let me explain to you why this *is* logarithmic regression. [Take a look at this chart detailing it.]( 
At first, it goes up at what seems like an exponential rate. I would argue that in terms of what has/is happening to Bitcoin is because there’s still so much room for it to grow - whether it be from new users, of which it has 7 billion still waiting to be tapped into, or the millions of companies who could begin to adopt it. This correlates very well - according to [Metcalfe’s Law,]( Bitcoin’s price grows mainly due to an increase in its userbase. Right now, Bitcoin price is growing so much *because there are still so many billions of people, that right now, there’s an endless flow of new adoption.* However, this trend will not continue forever, unless our population does.
Look at the latter part of the graph. Eventually, the growth rate begins to settle and decrease. This would happen when the amount of users becomes so large that the userbase simply can’t grow at the rate it is now. Again, once you apply Metcalfe’s Law, this is exactly when you see the growth rate of Bitcoin to decline.
This is going to be a very, very gross hypothetical with entirely made up and unrealistic numbers, but bear with me: 
Let’s say that there’s 10,000,000 people on the planet Mars. A guy named Elon Musk makes a new digital currency called Muskcoin. It’s a revolutionary technology. Elon tells 10 friends about Muskcoin, and they all adopt it. Those 10 people also share it with 10 friends each. Then those friends go and share it with 10 friends each as well, and so on and so forth. 
But eventually, they run into a problem. 9,000,000/10,000,00 of the population now use Muskcoin! But that means that now, each user won’t be able to share it with 10 friends - simply because there’s not enough people left on the planet to share Muskcoin with. This problem carries on and gets worse and worse the more Muskcoin’s userbase grows, up until the point where 9,999,000 people use it, and then there is virtually nobody left to introduce to Muskcoin.
Now let’s go back and apply Metcalfe’s Law. On Mars, we’re originally seeing that, since the userbase is multiplying by 10x every interval, Muskcoin is growing exponentially. It does this for a while. However, as the amount of people that they are able to introduce to Muskcoin decreases, the rate of growth of the price also decreases. Again, Metcalfe. This keeps going on until there’s virtually nobody left to adopt Muskcoin, and then there’s virtually no longer any growth in the price of Muskcoin.
tl;dr There’s a reason for why Bitcoin’s price came to be what it is now, and there’s a reason why it’s going to indefinitely slow down.

He’s right, though. The reason why the fees are so high is because *too many people are using it.* If everyone moved off to an altcoin, we wouldn’t be experiencing this heavy traffic that we are now and the fees would be normal again.

I think what he did is commendable and something that every crypto developer should.
Developers are the  people who can manipulate the markets and price. Once the developers no longer hold any of the coin, there is no incentive for them to manipulate the price.
Plus, Lee has never really talked about the price of LTC. Never. It’s obvious that he cares more for the underlying technology rather than how much money its worth.
Don’t be shallow and overlook the sacrifices Lee has made simply for a better technology

I never said it’s good, read my other comments. All I’m saying is that we’re interpreting this chart the wrong way. I 100% agree that this is a problem, and you can see how another Redditor interpreted this, saying “printing causes the value to go down and the value going down causes more printing. uh oh.” 
Also, what do you mean the USD has lost 3.5x value? I’m interested in knowing what that value really is, but saying it’s lost 3.5x value is the same as saying that USD has lost 350% value. Which is a logical fallacy, because nothing can lose more than 100% of its value

The only person here who said that Bitcoin is exponential growth is you. Well guess what, it’s not. In fact, [it’s more like non-linear logarithmic regression.]( Note that this logarithmic regression chart posted 3 years ago nearly predicted that Bitcoin would hit $10k by 2017. Not only this, it’s much more realistic. Nothing can go up exponentially forever. With logarithmic regression, it doesn’t go up forever. Eventually it meets that fine line where its growth is so insignificant that it’s irrelevant.

First off, logarithmic =/= exponential. They are two completely different things. In fact, logarithmic is literally the inverse of exponential. You are horribly misinformed.
Second off, I really don’t see what you’re trying to get at here. I think that you misunderstand what I was trying to say. Metcalfe’s Law doesn’t say that Bitcoin’s *price* is exponential. Metcalfe’s Law says that the *correlation between users and the valuation of Bitcoin* is exponential. Again, (v = u^2).

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:04:36
I’m guessing you’re talking about the Mt. Gox crash? If so, then that had absolutely nothing to do with a “cycle.”  It was the crash of the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange EVER. It was handling over SEVENTY PERCENT of all Bitcoin transactions worldwide. And the cause of the crash was external to the market - the price had absolutely no impact on it. Bitcoin could’ve been $1 for all it’s worth, and it would’ve still happened.
Again, we’ve absolutely never seen this “cycle” you’re talking about. We’ve had over a decade of Bitcoin, and we’ve never seen it, and unless you can tell me exactly why that would change now, all you’re doing is spreading pointless FUD that has absolutely no warrants behind it.

Not sure what you’re getting at here, but yes, that is what they are doing. And yes, I don’t think it’s fair that they can do that. That’s exactly why I’m invested in Bitcoin


I never said there was. I said that the chart is misleading. It’s not exponential, it’s a flat rate when you account for the price adjustment.

The US dollar. The peso. The British pound. The franc. 
What do these all have in common (besides being a currency)?
They are government backed. Which means they don’t need to win over support from the public, since they’d already have it. The government is the one enforcing fiat.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin isn’t backed by any government. Which means, for it to be useful, we need to gather public support. We are already doing this in many ways, and one form of it is advertising. Naming an entire stadium after Bitcoin is just one example of the advertising we are using.
Just because something has to be advertised doesn’t make it a cult. That would make Coca Cola the world’s biggest cult.

No, if we’re looking at the law, all that means is that we just have to maintain the amount of users we have now to keep that price.


[And there has been,]( what’s your point?


No, you wouldn’t. That’s only if Metcalfe’s law were linear - which it’s not. It’s exponential, and as it stated in the wikipedia link, it’s (v=u^2), where v=valuation and u=users. 
If it really were linear like you’re implying, we would be at billions of Bitcoin users right now.


This is a complete fallacy. [Again, the amount of daily transactions keep increasing continuously.]( Not to mention, its theoretical capacity will also be increased when LN is implemented, which we’ve come closer to its release than ever before, with an 100% success rate on the TestNet in the most recent tests.

Paintings are “open source” as well in the fact that I can make an exact replica of a painting. I just need to scan it and print it. However, it won’t have any value. Only the original will. This is the same for Bitcoin
You can’t replicate a Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network. You can only make a replica of the Bitcoin network but they are absolutely worthless (1000s of Bitcoin forks that provide nothing significantly new.)
You can make your own altcoin entirely with its own properties and have it worth something. This is exactly like a painting, where you can make your own painting entirely with its own properties and have it worth something.

@_date: 2017-12-17 00:07:24


Yes, I definitely agree.
However, if they were to move at the same rates, then this would be a linear correlation. Since they *aren’t* moving at the same rates, and as you pointed out, the valuation is moving much faster, that’s exactly why Metcalfe’s Law is exponential.
It can be described as (v = u^2), where v = valuation and u = users.
That would mean that the valuation rises exponentially compared to the user growth - which would explain the anomaly that you described.


Fair point, but I’d argue that [the amount of active users are still increasing regardless.](

This chart is horribly misleading. When you adjust for the decreasing value of the dollar, the line becomes a lot more flat.
We should be looking at how much money we’re printing vs. value of the dollar instead of just how much money we’re printing
edit: Basically what I’m trying to say is that the chart is proportionate to the value of the US dollar. As the price goes down, the amount printed goes up. This is because to print the same value of money, they would thus need to print more to match due to inflation
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:09:38
That’s not a fair analogy. I mean, I’m sure he would’ve been able to stop the sale of drugs and stolen credit cards. If Amazon and eBay have both managed to, then the Silk Bay should have been just as capable. If not, it’s incompetence and he deserves what he got
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:01:55
Yes, the price goes down due to the amount printed. I don’t know where I said otherwise but I didn’t mean to, must’ve been a typo
edit: Nevermind, I see what you mean. Yes, the price does go down because of the amount printed, but it also goes the other way around. When the price goes down, then the government will have to print even more to get the same value out of printing that they would have before the price went down.

Cost dollar averaging. Start buying now - don’t wait.  Buy small increments over time. Basically what this will do is average out the price of the Bitcoin you bought - whether the price goes up or down from now. It’s honestly the safest approach you can take for investing in Bitcoin.

The only person being rude in this interview was Ver. He was shouting over the other guy and always brought up how much money he makes whenever he was losing a point towards the end. There’s a lot more I could go off on, but basically Ver is just one big hypocritical asshole

The problem is that it’s advertised as a Bitcoin wallet, not a Bitcoin Cash wallet. There’s so many inherent problems due to this deception, and if you saw the thread from earlier today, you can see that Ver doing this can only be malicious in nature.

No, you misunderstand. Jihan Wu is known for being strongly against SegWit and all things Bitcoin. As OP put it, he saw SegWit as an “ugly hack.” 
This post is about Jihan Wu flip-flopping. And it’s not the first time. Just yesterday he posted that Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin, which completely goes against what he said before, saying that Bitcoin Cash IS indeed Bitcoin.

He got mad because he called Bitcoin Cash ‘Bcash’ (instinctively.) For whatever reason, Ver took this as a direct personal insult and started whining like a baby.
Earlier on in the interview he compared calling Bitcoin Cash ‘Bcash’ to calling a kid names. Even though it’s more like calling the United States of America ‘USA.’ It’s not meant to make fun of anyone, it’s just a shortening, it sounds better, and it’s a lot less misleading.
That last point is exactly why he hates Bcash, though. It’s not misleading. That’s exactly why he wants to call it Bitcoin Cash. He wants to mislead people, just like he has with bitcoin.com, articles claiming that Bcash is the real Bitcoin, and his wallet app defaulting users to Bcash, despite the app name being called “Bitcoin Wallet.”

It wouldn’t be the same because then it’s not a USD tether, it’s just a Bitcoin tether. BTC varies a lot in valuation compared to USD which os highly stable. People use USDT because USD is stable. If you make USDT based off of Bitcoin, then you defeat the whole purpose
Whatever, I think you’re trolling at this point so I’m going to stop
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:37:00
Isn’t that doing exactly the opposite? By renaming Bitcoin to Bitcoin Legacy, it makes US seem like we’re forks and giving a spot for shitcoin forks to claim that they’re the real Bitcoin.

I mean, if you check [the first page of Google results]( you’ll see that it’s not just this one guy’s opinion, it’s rather a rumor.
And it’s really not that too extreme to think that they would do this. This isn’t the first time Nvidia has taken measures to block miners from using their GPUs to mine. For instance, when [Nvidia took a hard stance and encouraged distributors to avoid selling GPUs to miners.]( 
I don’t think Nvidia is worrying about having too little demand. Right now, there problem is that they have *too much* demand and they can’t keep up. This will hopefully balance it out, or at least, make the demand for gaming GPUs separate from miner GPUs.

I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Nvidia is making a new line of GPUs (GTX 20?) that physically cannot mine crypto. This’ll drive down the demand and let gamers get their hands on good GPUs

There’s two ways you can make money off of Bitcoin
1) Buy and HODL. Don’t try to predict the market. Do some research, and you’ll see like the rest of us how Bitcoin’s fated to go up, with some discrepancies along the way. HODLing is a great option and it’s what I’m doing
2) Do EVEN MORE research and begin day trading. Of course, this is a different type of research. By day trading, you could very easily make more money than HODLing. At the same time, you could also lose a lot more money than HODLing. 
Whichever path you choose is based upon how safe you want to play it. You could do both. It’s all up to how much you’re willing to lose, but how much you want to make. 
Good luck, and I hope crypto brings you the same good fortune that it has brought me

You’re really overdramatizing this when you say that he’s “regularly” talked about Bitcoin.. last night after I made my previous comment, I saw a chart showing Dimon’s comments over the years. I believe in a span of 4-5 years, he only had 5 comments. Doesn’t seem like “he talks about nothing else.”

It's not FUD. I'm 100% for Bitcoin, but anybody in their right minds would know not to invest 100% of their life savings into something so volatile.

We really don’t know. It’s varied in the past.
But one thing’s for sure: the safer bet is to just HODL. Don’t sell. You’ll get both BTC and B2X. Worst case scenario, the price goes down and you can just sell your B2X (or BTC if it somehow loses)

The amount of times I’ve heard people say that they’ve heard of Bitcoin but don’t have a clue as to what it is is tremendous.

The assholes telling you to wait are going to be the death of you. If you read the info on (I think the sidebar or maybe the pinned newcomer FAQ post), it explains how waiting for “the dip” is a terrible idea.
Basically, “the dip” isn’t gonna happen. Just start buying now with “cost dollar averaging.” What this means is thst you buy a certain amount spread over a period of time, and you are literally just getting the average of the cost. This is definitely the safest way to do it. It pretty much guarantees that no matter what happens, you’ll be getting at least a decent deal.
Don’t wait to buy. Start NOW. Especially since we’re in a huge dip

This doesn’t make any sense. What’s the point of having crypto if it’s not decentralized? Then there’s really zero advantages over the current system.

If you go back and read the article again, yes, it does say that there wasn’t a crisis, but it’s also talking about how there wasn’t a buildup to a crisis in the first place. As in, it didn’t become a crisis because there was no foundation for it to be a crisis.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:55:33
The problem is that you’re mistaking bubble with high demand.
If you read the article, you’ll know about how people didn’t want it for its value, unlike Bitcoin. They wanted it for the fact that they were tulip bulbs. 
High demand =/= bubble

I don’t either. It’s mostly just the fact that they have terrible support, I’m guessing. But you shouldn’t have much of a problem if you store all of your bitcoin privately.. so again, there shouldn’t be any problem if you’re doing things right.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:25:31
Yeah, but why tell the truth when average people will just listen to him as a messiah and believe every single word he says? I mean, he is a very successful man. And it’s definitely not like Dimon has any interest in Bitcoin dying.

I don’t understand what confuses you about that. For over a century, California has been voting for Democratic presidents for a very large majority of the time, and the last time they voted for a Republican president was 30 years ago.
You’re right, somebody who can’t understand something as simple as that can’t have a productive conversation.

I know what Bcash’s purpose is, but it’s still frightful to see such outright fraud being committed by its backers.
Bcash should be making a name for itself as the better Bitcoin, not simply as stealing Bitcoin’s name and acting as if it were it.
If they really were the better crypto, then they wouldn’t have to resort to such fraudulent measures in order to maintain a user base.

Literally every single one of those is Apple/Beats, not just Beats. Which means that it includes the insanely popular AirPods and (for the stats that weren’t about wireless only) Apple earphones. 
I don’t know what you’re trying to prove here. I never said that Apple earphones weren’t popular. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. I was only saying that Beats aren’t as popular.
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:05:48
But you rarely see anyone wearing those in public anymore. Now, it’s mostly just earphones or AirPod-like wireless earphones

Learn to read. I said that the last time they voted for a Republican was 30 years ago and that they have been consistently voting Democrat for over a century.


What? How is that even a fucking question? Any amount of electorates is better than none....


I don’t know what they were teaching you in elementary, but no, that’s not the point of the electoral college. That would be the point of a popular vote system. We have the electoral college to prevent mob rule


No...? So you’re saying, Californian Republicans don’t want to be represented in every election because once every 30-40 years they somehow flip the state? They’d be getting WAY more electorates on average if they were just separate.
You have such a terrible line of thinking.


Literally all of those things are just as applicable to a state system..


Not really. That previous “complex system” wouldn’t be as complex anymore. The complex parts were the varying regions, and those regions would just be turning into states instead. The exact same disputes will be made, nothing will have changed.
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:12:55
I wish they did (for electoral purposes) but they probably won’t. Since the left controls California so strongly, they won’t split it up into states where Republicans will have a chance (seeing as there are lots of parts of California that are Republican-dominant.) I can’t think of a single reason why any party would give up such a strong advantage in both state and federal elections

And I’m saying that they’re definitely not. I haven’t seen anyone wearing them in well over half a year now. Everyone either wears apple headphones (not Beats lol) or cheap dollar store headphones

Beats are definitely not the most popular headphones..

Sure, maybe in another century, but Cali has been consistently voting Democrat for way more than a century already, and it’s only showing more signs of becoming even more Democratic. Hell, they broke double digits this past election, and Trump is pretty moderate for a Republican.


“How would Republicans or Democrats benefit from getting more electorates in the college?”


News flash: the current system is already technically just an agreement between regions. The literal only difference between this system and a system after secession would be the fact that it would be a multi-state agreement instead of a multi-regional agreement. And when you boil down to it, that one word change is arbitrary when you’re talking about a system like this.
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:17:28


This.. this is a joke, right? California is one of the three largest safe states in the country. They routinely vote democrat with very few exceptions. It’s been three decades since they’ve voted for a Republican candidate


You’re implying that the only way that Cali can preserve its current water arrangement is if it stays as one state... which is totally wrong. They can literally just make an agreement as part of the secession. Staying as one state is not the only possible solution, don’t be so narrow-minded
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:34:17


Really? Okay then, let’s see exactly what it says in the articles...








and the next one doesn’t even mention Beats directly.

But does that make him the inventor? No. He improved the lightbulb, but he didn’t invent it.


It’s not whining. It’s discussion and it’s opposition. If nobody showed any opposing views to Bcash and the malicious intentions they have, then everybody would have already switched over.
You’re trying to become the world’s biggest global digital currency. Expect some criticism. And don’t dismiss it as “whining”
