Lol I did something similar with silver, but not in the millions at all.  BUT, I would've paid in USD and pretty sure that I bought more BTC to cover up for it.
That was also the last time I bought silver.  At the time I wanted to diversify a bit.

We're any of these core devs there from the beginning?

Some people may downvote me for this, but I hope it does go down to 3k, gotta get that discount BTC! (Hopefully your sister cashed out before that happens!, Or who knows maybe it won't, I been preparing for either situation!) 
I learned how to trade doing technical analysis and I'm still unsure of what I think is more likely lol.

I'm in the process of installing it now - it seems AWESOME!  I've always wondered why we don't have something like this, similar to torrenting, even how you were able to torrent on android phones and whatnot, that would be an ideal way to trade - if it's possible.  I see that happening in the future to be truly decentralized.  I heard about this a few times but was reluctant to download it and usually I'm on my mobile.  But just now I was roaming around localbitcoins and paxful, and I am a bit concerned about their KYC thing, and I saw an article on bitcoin.com that mentioned Bisq which led me to research it &amp; led me to this thread - excited to check it out! 
Maybe it needs more promo, but we know WOM is the best way :-)

yeah isn't the saying generally when it goes down it means buy more (assuming were talking about something that isn't destined to be a bubble lol which IMO bitcoin isn't)
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:27:38
but based on what I have learned and what the current global economy and vibe seem to be .... i would feel a hell of a lot less comfortable ever shorting bitcoin then buying some .... i made like $30 in the last two weeks but honestly to me I'm looking at long term like in a few years I see 1 whole bitcoin as being a brick of gold or some shit maybe more ..... 
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:46:45
good point 
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:32:43
very smart strategy 
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:44:44
I agree with this 100%, but I think the fact that Donald Trump is president and since in my opinion and at least from what I observe and read .... this is instability of the US dollar and uncertainty .... i did not want Trump To be president but I do think with him being president will be better for bitcoin (not sure about the greater good though .... but ultimately for bitcoin the uncertainty in the US at least here in New YORK area and a lot of what I hear about again ....) regardless of any of our political beliefs I think it's safe to say if Hillary were president, bitcoin may have less chances of significant increases in the upcoming months and even years .... not sure though.  I read on another post
 someone was like if Donald Trump just tweeted the word bitcoin the price would skyrocket and another user said if he tweeted that he hated bitcoin it would skyrocket even more and I thought woah good point !

what is the definition  really of a bubble and excuse my ignorance honestly in the financial sector I caught onto bitcoin years back when it was under $100, didn't understand it thought it was cool then see its over $1k like many others I'm sure ..... 
but anyway from what I understand a bubble is based more around hype (I truly don't know if what I'm saying is right hence why I'm asking), Can this situation even be classified as a bubble? I mean can the dollar bubble? can gold bubble? did it? maybe the answers to these questions are yes, but I guess everytime i hear bubble related to finance I think of two things : the dot com bubble and the housing market..... to me bitcoin seems a whole lot more stable (in terms of its foundation and use) then either of those things ..... i need to do more research but just one question that keeps popping into my head 
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:26:07
word, but about a month ago had I not been on this sub or reading about bitcoin I wouldve asked the Same lol 
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:56:27
thank you! yes, messing with VPNs and Tor a few years back, starting to be big on the privacy thing was how I discovered bitcoin....i remember I was gonna buy some to be truly private and the process (at the time), seemed so complicated ... to go buy a certain gift card and then do all these things...i was so ignorant and naive back then smh.  but you're right and even though coinbase was the easiest way I found for me to purchase bitcoins, it's been bothering me that they were sitting in there especially after hearing horror stories of Mt. gox... i know its a different type of platform...but same concept of a third party holding what's yours.

good advice but I feel most of the US has maybe slightly even heard of "bitcoin."  My mom works in finance, in compliance funny enough, and has only heard the word bitcoin on occasion thrown around ..... she didn't have any understanding of what it was until I explained it to her....and she works with one of the more advanced in regards to tech financial firms ....  i dont think (could be wrong) so many people know what bitcoin is yet .... i do think that the price can rise and fall and it is a gamble regardless but I personally (again I know shit about finance but I do know people and I worked on Wall Street physically ... tho not for Wall Street lol) and grew up In NYC ... maybe this isn't relevant but I feel like once these people really understand or hear that bitcoin is crypto gold at that point it would spike up and up .... unless there's another alternative coin that performs better,  from my relatively newbie perspective of course, I feel like the value even if it does fall significantly below whst it is now, will only rise in thr future 
then again I really don't know much about any of this haha but "I have a good feeling....."
still good advice though and it's true ... if I invest all my money now and then it falls to $300 and stays there awhile, I'm gonna be pissed at myself and lose faith probably pull out, when in reality I probably should buy more lol (depends on the reason for the fall also i suppose)

I can see this happening too despite my lack of financial background or knowledge 
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:24:50
this is how I feel too I was waiting for a dip but it's almost risky to me not to get whatever you can now....worst case scenario if it does dip, I see it highly unlikely it won't bounce back...  that's just my opinion based on my pretty limited knowledge of block chain or finance ... but from a few years of lurking and keeping an eye on things  .... 
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:37:02
im also curious what happens with mycelium if something happens to your phone? 
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:58:28
I was thinking the same thing lol ... or something along those lines .... in theory YES ... in history books they want us to believe it's that way ...  but it isn't at fuckrn all 
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:46:14
word I think the stock market increases are just hype .... propaganda press releases Yada Yada ... also the rest of the world economy suffers the stronger the us dollar gets .... to.me the recent increase in the dow Jones is hype and it's gonna crash within the next four years ... a student loan debt crisis is brewing IMO
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:31:47
Suppose one does buy via coinbase.... should one transfer out of coinbase wallet to one of those which you mentioned? I assume the coinbase vault is basically BS? I mean they still technically have control ....
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:44:49
hmm that's interesting to hear, I guess I never thought about shorting the other crypto currencies ... what are your thoughts on ETH for the long haul?
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:23:09
yikes this sounds scary, then the best way to protect yourself now is to change passwords? I use KeePass as a password keeper not sure if that matters .... it almost seems as if if this gets publicity it'll be worse as there are lots of other crawlers out there that probably have cached user information and exposure to it can open up Pandoras box for hackers looking to stir up some drama no?  
That being said I'm grateful for the PSA, but my first thought was why isn't this being highly publicized?
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:48:32
I actually think the federal government is worse than any banking and is the worst conspiracy .... fucken student loans mother fuckers scam 
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:28:29
and to be clear that $30 I made just buy buying some bitcoin that I can afford at a lower price then what it is today !  no day trading or anything just plan to leave it there maybe pay for a couple of things eventually to keep it healthy and try to participate in the transactional aspect 
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:36:36
something else will surface ... probably instant private communication apps
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:37:39
This man is just fascinating.  I swear to god, he's a gift man. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:39:06
anyone using the cash app? I signed up and got their cash card I honestly can't remember if I used my social I did it a few months ago ... I do like that it seems they don't have fees but I really wish there was an anonymous option 
not that i don't wanna pay taxes, I understand the need for taxes, I don't want to pay excess tax that my erratic acting inconsiderate govt has the authority and could easily enact on bitcoin at anytime .... 
and more importantly, I don't want them to be able to control me through their tracking of money and of my spending behavior ... sick of it
