underrated comment
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:18
you don't, there isn't
wait on the Stark lady or get toasted
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:06:13
k. thanks
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:58:52
so isn't LN limited to 8/10% (segwit adoption rates) of nodes already?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:37:48
not sure what private info I am sharing?
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:48:15
the more of us the better.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:33:32
brother... I have no idea what you just wrote
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:20:01
quality post
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:37:48
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:00:01
what about reardencode's comment?
All LN software will use segwit, you cannot send Lightning funds to non lightning software.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:38
i know. i just calculated my overall gains.  and I smiled. and bought a bit more.  
I am done buying for this week.  may buy back in next week.

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:06:44
Goldman Sachs is
[Big Boy Moves](
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:41:36
so LN can only be used with wallets to open and close channels that support segwit?
thanks for the patience i am not a complete noob. but I am by no means a pro either.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:52:26
as a normie it would be nice.

@_date: 2018-09-05 12:10:42
good work
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:12:27
please use and stop just hodling.... using increases the value of the coin and crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:17:51
OMGOMGOMGOMG I am a Bitcoin Pro!
except I didn't buy last night.
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:47:51
thanks for this
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:01:52
good. please continue

@_date: 2018-08-08 13:23:21
but if you actually use it.... then it will go up.
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:43:23
not good
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:19:12
if you want it to go up....
USE IT!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:40:48
i know nothing of this app. 
but sure ... tell me ALL about it
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:16:54
bet you miss that crazy broad.. don't ya?
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:52:51
curious .... any estimate on how many coins per hour a petaflop computer can mine?
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:37:10
yeah... they need to kinda fix that.
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:18:11
japanese mt gox accounts STILL have 1+ billion in coin to dump on the market
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:49:56
we'll see.
meanwhile crypto is falling like there is no tommorrow
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:42:22
yeah... that's been a successful thing for a few millennia.
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:56:00
no.. no.. it won't
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:22:17
so ..... never
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:39:30
dang what were those things called again????
tulips... no
beanie babies... no
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:21:57
asking the real questions
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:41:23
sounds really sexual
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:41:09
So... only ~~smart~~ nerd people are left here?
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:38:49
use the damn thing and the price will rise.
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:45:33
looks that way
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:29:13
when the 12 month return is negative... then you gonna see some fallin'
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:28:35
but can an excel spreadsheet link and sync over multiple computers???
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:44:40
give it time
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:14:05
this is the correct answer.
What is needed is an app that REGULAR people want to use.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:54:29
other than reddit, where can I find some crypto communities?
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:23:38
this is gonna end badly for them.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:03:53
If ALL crypto currency hodlers did this with just 10% of their coins split between 4 NEW people.  The increase in value of the respective market caps would be extraordinary.
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:13:19
kinda the problem though... 
too much hodl not enough usdl (&lt;- use)
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:36:01
tru. but we want mass adoption. not just nerd adoption
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:03:55
just what supply and demand need...
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:24:17
bitcoin being stable... honestly is the best freaking thing ever
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:40:30
using drives the price up
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:08:00
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:33:37
didn't know anyone still had 3G
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:10:11
@_date: 2018-03-24 04:44:44
it is a shame though. because ;borrowing and lending are needed for a currency to flourish
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:04:28
so you have no ideas.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:05:58
thanks this is incredible useful.

@_date: 2018-03-19 12:09:45
it won't stop crypto
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:17:51
"you people"
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:55:32
i don't think that will work.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:20:09
Kraken offered to buy them for 1.5B???/
Why wouldn't he take this?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:06:29
just did. come at me bro.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:55:14
simple but true
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:50:29
refreshing honesty
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:58:14
damn good info. thanks
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:07:01
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:23:06
so basically... fight club rules
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:14:51
not so much as to not have questions.
thanks for the wallet list
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:11:49
thanks for your response
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:59:04
how do i get an mp4/gif version of this PLEASE
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:29:04
that is really cool.
but it is a generalized answer.
walletgenerator.net is a trusted site.  Why would they ask for your private key.  
Are they scammers - In which case they should not be a trusted site?
Or are they asking for something they should not be - if so why, wouldn't it build bad behaviors into the community?
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:25:36
what is the new cool lending platform?
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:34:32
there are some positives to that argument.  But my question remain nonetheless. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:25:11
so what does a "cold" wallet/trezor do?
does it just protect the private key?
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:01:46
its not his money. its an asset that his is disrupting  markets while he is disposing of it.  your answer is stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:58:51
hell the twinkle twins needs to take 1.5 B for the team and buy those coins.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:20:57
i like to try &amp; understand how/why it makes it easier to respect...
i am not really good at doing what I am told.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:22:48
this is the answer. thanks.
my next stoopid question
Honestly other than being able to generate the corresponding public key what is the real risk in sharing your private key?
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:07:25
read your comment history.  Ask yourself are you really that gay?
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:05:46
directions unclear.
posting private key, ssn, d.o.b., address, front &amp; back of id and all major credit cards.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:51:27
thanks for a real and accurate answer.
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:51:37
dis is sad
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:20:19
wow. technology/science
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:02:21
so you have no ideas.
@_date: 2018-03-17 01:03:52
awesome.. but no.
legally it would be neat if the sale could be forced.... maybe all the mt gox claimants sign a petition.
everytime market sets up a rise. he comes and craps on it.
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:00:18
lightning is damn complex.  If they do not smartly hide all this complexity from the end user it won't be adopted. E.O.S.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:31:59
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:23:21
thank you . I will read this today.
After about thirty snarky answers on 3 different threads a few people actually gave me enough info to get the answer.
you are one of those people who helped.
have a good day.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:39:45
thanks .... you have made one person less nooby
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:06:21
actually. you didn't have an answer but still felt like commenting.
you should have simply sat in a corner with your meme's because you add nothing to this thread.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:22:29
but the address of the "cold" wallet would show on a blockchain explorer as a receiving address at least once.  
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:23:10
thanks for taking the time to respond
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:47:39
so how do they have an address that's not associated with an exchange.
is there some magic website that spits out ETH addresses?
and then how would that get it out?
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:53:47
this guy economics
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:23:37
still waiting.... nothing happening
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:04:59
i didn't.  thanks for a sincere answer.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:41:06
u know what i meant young whipper snaper.
Now get off my lawn!
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:11:34
to share with the public . This site is a trusted site so I was trying to figure out why they would ask for your private key.
It appears the answer is that the site is supposed to be downloaded and used.  Not online, so you would be giving you private key to no one. 
My next silly question is other than the generation of a unique public key , what is the real risk of sharing your private key? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:26:42
is it simple to use.
not trying to cause stress.  I really want bitcoin to succeed; but if this thing ain't simple to use, regular folks like me are not buying.
full disclosure I want ALL crypto's to win.  Wars have been started by banks
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:25:02
would shapeshift or some other coin washer stop this issue.  Or would whoever is suing you simply subpoena shape shift or whatever washer you use?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:08:14
I think I understand why the site is asking for it.  (They assume the website is being run offline)
But honestly other than being able to generate the corresponding public key what is the real risk in sharing your private key? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:19:30
thanks for this.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:55:47
38k of demand removed
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:21:59
I think you have a great idea
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:28:42
are you telling me that somewhere publicly accessible there is a bitcoin public address with the winklevoss's billions on it.
And if I had there private key I could move their billions to myself???
if so what, is the winklevoss public address?
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:46:14
so they are running a node?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:14:03
I think the offline part is correct.  That part of the website should only be used if running from a local server.  
I think they should have put that on that page as well as the front.
My next stoopid question is: other than the generation of your public key what is the real risk of sharing your private key?
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:01:16
am average, i have told anyone who would listen the implemntation is wonky
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:59:34
agree with the content. sarcasm not needed though
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:45:52
okay... but where did it go?
where is the scammer's wallet... it has to be on an exchange somewhere right?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:18:52
not trolling. asking a question.. sorry if it is upsetting you.
please stop reading.
have a good day.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:32:03
I see your point.  I am just trying to expand my knowledge.
it seems like it is  doable thing to break bitcoin anonymity; it's just not worth it unless you are a state level actor.
tl:dr don't steal Putin's bitcoin or he will turn you into borscht! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:20:56
I am not assuming anything.  I am sharing my thoughts as a crypto-currency cheerleader who wants to see it succeed.
And simply put, what I see so far is really cool; but impossible for Joe Schmo to use regularly.
I sincerely did not mean to offend you. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:58:43
gr8 write up.... I kinda disagree with the conclusions.  Lightning seems too complex for the end users.  
If it can be simplified it is awesome.  Not trying to catch a ban just being honest.
I think the really smart people on and around Bitcoin have to realize most people really ain't the smart. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:08:38
I have made thousands and thousands of dollars trading crytpo AND NEVER KNEW WHAT THE FUCK IT REALLY WAS.
Wow.  Thanks random Internet man/woman.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:30:16
so this site should not be included on the trusted site list?
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:24:43
honestly the best thing for price would be some stability
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:21:06
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:18:24
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:23:39
but doesn't lightning need segwit?
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:17:41
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:09:31
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:01:01
really is a good question
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:30:56
then wait my friend
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:46:43
upset I read that foolishness
@_date: 2018-04-30 12:06:16
u misunderstand.
i am pro cryypto, LN has solvable issues.
they should not ADD to the issues by introducing a hard cap to transaction size.
just my $0.02
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:59:23
$20 transactions or less = bad idea
just being honest
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:13:42
that is going to go really well..... or really poorly
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:52:56
my point is as a crypto semi-user, want-it-to succeed, bank-hater, normie.
I will NOT use or try to learn it if the payment has a low ceiling like twenty bucks.
if there must be a ceiling it should be like $1,000.
think about it, Grocery Store $142 {EASY}
Nice Dinner with friends and booze $250 {EASY}
I am not poor; but I am not well off either.  These numbers are significantly higher for a lot of people.
Just my $0.02
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:02:38
this is the correct answer
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:07:34
ln needs more testing
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:04:07
It would be neater if this general list had the actual companies listed
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:59:13
Adoption is what will ultimately make crypto the currency of the future. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:57:20
tell me more
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:41:12
short answer... no
long answer.... hell no

nd tht is d prblm

you had MORE patience when you were younger...wow
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:44:37
not a bit... i jumped ship in jan 2018.
check my post history.
after the futures market opened and things starting going to sh!t I knew it was time to bounce. sorry guys.
i did hope crypto would break the banks stranglehold on society but I was never a zealot.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:48:51
truthfully.... 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin.
the "price" is only an issue if you intend to return to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:39:58
this is the correct answer
