I heard it's been delayed to 3 weeks now.

So wait, the big issue you have is that the Canadian government didn't issue the warning? But no problem with police shaking down foreigners and taking their money away? I'm thinking maybe that's a hit more of a problem than an alarmist headline on the Internet.

Haha I bought a half a bitcoin last December at $1000

This isn't automatically true. Is there anyone looking over the KeePass source? It's entirely possible that there isn't. 
An did you aren't compiling it from source, it doesn't matter anyway, because you are trusting the binaries. It would be trivially easy for authorities to get access to the server where the files are hosted and swap out the binaries for ones with back doors.

The second reason this is huge is that stripe is (often) the cc processor of highly technical (nerdy)  developers. Likely a high intersection with Bitcoin users. 
As a developer who built an e-commerce system on stripe, it is extremely appealing to me that some day I will be able to add Bitcoin with only a small amount of code. I probably will when they make it available to everyone. 
Also, it's super cool because the system is just high profile enough that when I do turn Bitcoin on, it will make national (Canada)  news :-)

Sounds to me like they aren't yours.

I love the quote but that ideal has been dead for a long time at Apple, and even the man who used to have the ideal has been dead for a long time. 
ITunes cards are a massive revenue stream for Apple, as well as the deals that they have with credit card companies. Bitcoin directly threatens that, and Apple will fight it to the death.

2 factor authentication immediately 
Long secure password...  16+ random characters, different for every site
Only transact from a dedicated, well secured computer that you don't surf the general Web from
Type exchange urls directly in the browser bar, bookmark them and only visit via the bookmarks
manually verify SSL certs. 
Store all but small amounts of coin in true cold storage. Keep the smallest amount of coin/fiat in exchanges as possible 
Only run official or well known coin clients (bitcoin-qt, armory etc) and verify md5 hashes when you download. 
**always** assume that if your coins are not in cold storage they could vanish, at any moment. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:23:23
Why the hell would we do that? 
Then we are no better than governments printing fiat when they feel like it.

I'm ready to buy, but you know what drives me crazy? I can't find out how much they charge in Bitcoin, unless I create an account and check out.  It seems like almost everyone who accepts Bitcoin does this. 
Is there something im missing here?

So many. I used to do computer support for small businesses, and they _all_ use quickbooks.  This is huge.

You've got that right!

As we found out last week, open source doesn't mean secure. KeePass could just as easily have backdoors in it.

Ugh, Edmonton? Calgary please!

Also, at a large scale you risk having large amounts of funds on two exchanges, which could be a significant risk if one or both of the exchanges vanish with your money. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:45:43
Wow I'm going to start mining that coin right away! 
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:29:56


Holy crap. That was when Bitcoin was at $5. That's like 8 million follows with of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:46:48
Because they spent all the commissions on hooked and blow before they realized they had lost the coins? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:27:57
It's him. Guys, it's him! 
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:26:49
I do!

I live in Canada  much nicer here.

You should build a miner. People are making piles of money selling 3d renders of miners.

This is actually a good use for old fashioned banks... Safe deposit box for your paper wallet.

As a Canadian, :(
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:04:36
Except they don't store your actual money either. They just store an entry in the database that says they owe you x dollars... Same as mtgox. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:13:42
Should we just make it easy and I can transfer all my Bitcoin to sparkfun now? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:14:16
If they aren't in your wallet, they aren't your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:01:35
You just did. 
Wouldn't it be better to ask the mods to remove these?
