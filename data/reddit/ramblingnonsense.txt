The coins I've purchased since personal mining became unfeasible have all been though cb, which I then immediately withdrew and now keep locally. For me they are a convenient way to invest in coins.

My guess has always been that Satoshi was several people using a single identity. I think it's possible this guy was one of them, but even if he is, that doesn't mean Satoshi has been unmasked.

And once their patent is granted by our technologically inept patent office, they will sue the bejesus out of anyone and everyone they find using "their" innovation. That includes all the bitcoin developers and businesses.

From everything I've ever heard about Gates that was exactly the right way to talk to him. His default is to shoot your idea down as stupid or unworkable; if you can defend it and are *willing* to defend it, he will reverse and give it consideration.

Or, you know, if they are a hack publisher desperate to gain some relevance. This is, as someone pointed out, the same magazine that recently did a story claiming they had proof heaven existed, based on someone's account of their near-death experience.

How come gobutler and Magic have the exact same example requests?

Keep the offer open. Personally I think the odds of this guy being the same Satoshi are extremely slim, but he may well need help in keeping this Newsweek hack from destroying his life.

Interestingly, that dichotomy of grammar, typing and spelling continues even into his recent posts. In November of 2013 he made a post [here]( Note the use of his full name in the signature, proper capitalization throughout, etc. Now compare that to this [post]( in the same forum a month later. Note he's now just signing "dorian" and most of the post, except for abbreviations, lack capital letters. 
Edit: fixed first link
Know what it looks like to me (admittedly, based on a uselessly small sample size)? Looks like he posts from his phone sometimes. His Amazon reviews are the same way... perfect capitalization and grammar in one, almost no capitals and several typos in another.

Plot twist: Newsweek knows this isn't the real Satoshi, but hopes to flush the real one out by endangering a random stranger.

I don't think they were a Ponzi. Running a Ponzi, even for as short a time as Gox operated, requires a certain level of technical competence and a basic familiarity with  arithmetic. The MtGox fiasco is the result of unspeakable incompetence. No malice is required.

He's probably being advised by an attorney to keep his mouth shut.

He may also just randomly use Brit spellings in his posts. I've done that myself sometimes, usually without thinking, because I read a lot of British authors and have since I was a kid. It can't be that uncommon. I know (the real) SN used British-isms from time to time, too, which is interesting. At the time most people thought he did it to disguise his location, though he didn't do it often or consistently enough to convince anyone he was actually a Brit, and his post timings line up more with someone living on US Eastern or Central time.

That is interesting, but proves nothing except that Dorian sometimes typed better in 2004 than he did in some 2009 correspondence.

Same here, my Mom msg'd me asking if I'd lost my coins. Fortunately she's pretty tech-savvy for a Boomer and I didn't have a hard time explaining the actual situation.

Yeah, that's a peculiar turn of phrase and the video uses it several times.

Once it is less profitable to mine and people start giving up on it, won't the difficulty fall again? I mean in theory the mining should always reach some sort of equilibrium, right?
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:45:31
I mined 8 coins back when you could do pool mining on your own GPU. Most of them paid for a medical procedure my daughter needed 3 years ago. I needed them more then then I do now; no regrets on cashing them out at the time. 
That said, I continue to buy coins in small amounts when I can. Hoooooooold.....

It is common practice for court-appointed attorneys to strongly encourage a plea deal, and they will throw the car if you insist on fighting it. I saw it happen many times where I grew up. 
There's quite a difference between what the law says and what you actually get.

Now if only he'd actually said it.

Two things: first, the way you've phrased it makes it sound like you're consulting a lawyer, so they're probably waiting to hear from *you*. Second, unregulated in this instance means "not regular", as in its not a standard transaction like a paycheck or audited income. You would get the same reaction from them if you had dumped money into your account that you'd found in the street or had hidden in a safe.
Keep track of the big picture here: you're about to buy a house, and you're on the verge of getting the means to do so. If you were counting on the bitcoin money to secure the loan, that would be one thing, but otherwise this is not the time to try and educate them on the subject. Secure your loan, *then* pursue the matter of bitcoin legality.
@_date: 2015-04-02 01:40:21
No, the courts are. Good luck fighting that, since you'll have had all your assets seized, probably been imprisoned for a long time, and have a government-appointed lawyer who will file a plea deal on your behalf whether you want one or not.

Didn't the real Satoshi re-emerge to state that he was not Dorian? That message was generally accepted as genuine. How hard would it be for him to state "I am (not) Craig Wright"?

Ingenico devices use plugin modules to add capabilities to their devices, usually software and hardware in a single package. They have one for NFC transactions, one for chipped credit cards, and I'm guessing there will be one for bitcoin, too, probably via NFC or a QR code on the display.

Pretty sure Tor preserves anonymity even in the case of a hostile exit node, as long as you don't do anything to expose your IP or identity over your session. There's a theoretical timing attack that could expose you but it requires a hostile entity monitoring your connection, your entrance node and the exit node's ISP. That can be avoided if you change your identity path regularly.

Eh, I feel for him. I'm an IT guy myself, and I've made mistakes. And while I do wipe every single work-related drive that has left our building bound for the garbage, I have let personal drives slip through my fingers. 
Besides, if he had wiped the drive, there'd be no story and we'd probably never heard about him in the first place. "Oh hell, I just remembered I wiped a drive containing $3M in bitcoin, what a fool I am!" vs "I threw out a drive containing $3M in bitcoin, and *it's still out there somewhere*."
