This is an insult!  We demand to be taken seriously and are not a satire!

Bitcoin Extreme is the true vision of Emergent Consensus!

All constants and transaction validation checking by users is a form of central planning by developers.
This is why Bitcoin EXTREME will remove all such code, and allow miners, as Satoshi envisioned, decide what is valid or not, and users will follow Nakamoto Consensus.

Yes, Unlimited tries to centralize planning, but in reality, it should be left to the market.  Maybe the market will figure out a smarter way to do it than just a signal that can be ignored.

This is untrue, Bitcoin Extreme will not centralize any synchronization or coordination mechanism and will let the market decide on the proper way to do this.

Bitcoin Extreme removes all central planning, and allows miners to decide what is valid.  If the majority of hashpower says a transaction is valid, it is.  Since Bitcoin depends on the majority of miners to be honest, the security is the same as Bitcoin.  But the central planning is gone.

With true emergent consensus, we can even choose to confiscate coins from thieves (or anyone miners choose).

We welcome Peter R to the ranks of supporters that will champion Bitcoin EXTREME!

Someday we hope to convince a rich benefactor who can endow us with a million dollar development fund to truly live out Satoshi's Vision.

We are still looking for expert developers to help.  Perhaps once the Bitcoin Unlimited developers see their goals align, they will join us.

The market will determine the way for users to accept parameters.  We don't believe in central planning like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin "Unlimited".

The market will probably tolerate a low level of inflation (like it does for Dogecoin and Ethereum) in exchange for the advantages of low fee or even free transactions.  Metcalfe's Law will show the value will grow faster due to the number of transactions so high compared to the amount of inflation.

This post appears to be removed from any index.  Censors can't handle Bitcoin EXTREME.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:09:00
This is a serious project.  We support the free market, Nakamoto Consensus, and Satoshi's vision of One CPU, One Vote.
will probably ban this post because he is scared of Bitcoin EXTREME.

Yes.  If industry giants like Roger Ver, who have extensive economic background, support Monero, there is little reason to think they would not support it in Bitcoin Extreme.
