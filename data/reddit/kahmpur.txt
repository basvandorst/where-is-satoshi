Bitcoin ended up like 30% up yesterday. If that’s a bubble popping I’d like to see what it does when it goes up

No one can give you a solid answer. Any advice given is purely speculation. Bitcoin can go to 20k tonight or drop to 4k next week.

Don’t doubt it at all.

Bitcoin is experiencing social media growth. If you google bitcoin you’ll most likely stumble upon r/bitcoin. This place is as good as any to ask questions

A brand new commodity that has daily swings of 20% + is being traded and people are surprised that investors aren’t going in balls deep?

those are just the limit and stop orders, market orders are the ones people just buy or sell at the current price. So you know what some people are planning on doing but never what some people are about to do. At the end of the day it's not as useful as you may think. I whale may come in and buy everything up or sell tanking the price.

Futures were designed so people in certain industries could hedge against risk by buying positions in certain markets and also to better plan their finances.
lets say you're tropicana and you want to ensure how much you'll be paying for frozen concentrated orange juice a few months for now. You take out a futures contract for it locking yourself into a price. Of course you don't really know the price, you're making the best guess but at least you already know how much you paid for it.
But now if you don't actually need frozen concentrated orange juice you're just gambling on the price.
