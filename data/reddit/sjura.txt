I have some exams coming up the next few weeks but I'll try to stop by. It would be cool to hear how you guys at Justcoin are doing.

Why would a drug addict's comfort conflict with yours? You're probably afraid that the drug addict will rob you for your money to buy his or hers "medicine", but there are a lot of possible, peaceful solutions to that conflict.

Ask support to raise your limit to 10000€ if you want to withdraw larger amounts.

This is probably not how it will play out. The norwegian exchange Justcoin is afaik just going to add 25% on their fees.

I just sold my BTC for EUR, never touched dollars. If you have USD on Gox you will have to buy BTC for your USD and then sell them for EUR if you want to get your money out using SEPA-transfer.

They hold nations for ransom. Extort them into implementing IMF policies as conditions for the loans they give out.

I withdrew several thousand euro (&lt;10000€) to a bank account in Norway  in late october. Took about seven weeks until the funds showed up.

Remember to make sure that the sender of the BTC have added a transaction fee if you're not gonna wait for a confirmation. I once bought some BTC with cash from a guy that didn't add a transaction fee and I didn't stick around to wait for any confirmations. The transaction showed up on my blockchain.info-app instantly, but after two-three days in limbo wo any confirmations the transaction just disappeared and the original sender got his BTC back. Fortunately the seller was a great guy (a noob though) and sent me my BTC after I called him up and explained what happened.
If I meet someone I haven't done business with earlier, I will usually stick around for one confirmation. If I trust the other person I just make sure that the transaction is going to my wallet and that a transaction fee is added.

Did you use an escrow service?

I used DNB, but SB1 and Nordea should work as well. Gox charged me a 1% fee on the SEPA-transfer (as stated in their FAQ) and DnB charged me about 20NOK (~$3). Your bank is probably listing their prices for receiving SEPA and international wire transfers on their homepage.
If you're withdrawing from Gox to Norway; remember to sell in EUR and withdraw using SEPA!

You will have to pay taxes (you could always not report it and see what happens, but that is very risky, especially if your're recieving substansial amounts of fiat. You don't want the taxman on your ass.) on the profit you made from trading in bitcoins. In 2013 you will have to pay 28% of the profit, but this will be lowered to 27% in 2014.
It is not possible to withdraw USD in a SEPA-transfer from Gox. USD can only be transmitted using international wire transfer and that means larger fees and a much longer wait (probably).
My bank converted the euro to NOK using a fair rate, so no big hidden fee there.

I posted this in This "news" is several weeks old and it is not a big thing. In Norway we will have to pay capital gains tax on bitcoin profits, and that is just like expected. The weird thing is that businesses will have to pay a sales tax (25%) on bitcoin sales because the government treat bitcoin as an electronic service. The norwegian exchange Justcoin doesn't add 25% on the price anyway, because they are not selling bitcoins themself; they're just fascilitating trades between individuals. They will just add 25% on the fees afaik.
Even weirder is the fact that norwegians are supposed to pay a wealth tax (1% of all assets you own, minus debt) on their bitcoin fortunes, even though the government says that bitcoins are an electronic service! Using this logic we should also pay wealth tax on Spotify, Netflix, Google cloud etc. Is just doesn't make sense, and I think this is because the government doesn't quite understand the concept of bitcoins. The government is double-taxing bitcoins in Norway until they can figure out wth a bitcoin really is. Hopefully 2014 will bring some clarity in this field.
Anyway, this doesn't impact many norwegian bitcoin holders in any big way. Few people pay any wealth tax at all because most people have mortgages, student loans etc. that's deductible. The real problem is that the unclarity surrounding the sales tax thingy is hampering bitcoin startups that want to stay within the legal framework.
Tl;dr Not a big deal. Bitcoins are getting double taxed (in a way that doesn't affect many) until the government can figure out the concept of bitcoins.
