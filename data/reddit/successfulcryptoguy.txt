All of the advice here is 'good' but imho, incomplete. The most glaring failure is to ask the right first question: **what exactly do you want to do as a "bitcoin dev"**?
Bitcoin is multifaceted. 
It is a combination of many disciplines, among them:
1. Economics
2. Cryptography
3. Programming and Computer Science
4. Finance
5. Business and Entrepreneurship
6. Computer Security and Networks
7. Law
What is it really, exactly - do you want to do? That question alone should get you started and point you in the right direction. How do you see yourself 2,3,4,5 years down the line in the 'bitcoin eco-system'?

There are many ways, and as per my experience most of the ones like you who tried ended up making their own coins. Vitalik, Charlie Lee. Some of the others became miners like Jihan Wu. Some forged a path to entrepreneurship like u/memorydealers Roger Ver. Others like the Winklevoss twins created their legally compliant exchange. Yet others still like Ross Ulbricht, created his own platform like the Silk Road. Others put up companies and started ICOs - we all know how that went. Others like Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, sought to force their "bitcoin vision" on others through patents, lawsuits and their own business ventures.
Make your vision more specific.


I get you. Now imagine a world where everybody uses bitcoin. How would you "earn a living" in such a world like that?

The next question is, "are you solving a problem that hasn't been solved already with a similar technology that does the same thing?"
Who will pay for such a technology. 
When Bill Gates "sold" his operating system - his idea - to IBM, back before Microsoft was a thing, he had a target buyer but the product came a little later. Always have a buyer in mind ready. Put yourself in their shoes. Would you buy, something that's a promise of a thing to be made? Or would you buy, something that already works out of the box? Proceed from there.

The environment.
