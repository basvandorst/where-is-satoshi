Yea OP I doubt their dataset is large enough to make running their db in memcache even remotely expensive

This is besides the point, considering the volume of money they move in a month and the tiny fee they take and you can see they are obviously making a sizeable amount of money.
Imagine if this was the NY Stock Exchange or a major Forex website that was offering up these excuses, it would be inexcusable.
Mtgox's volume for the last 30 days: 
30-day Volume (Currency)285,058,650.29 USD
Link to fee schedule:
Lets just settle on an average fee of 0.30% which is likely much lower than their average
285058650.29*.003 = 855176
Mtgox cleared over $800K USD in the last 30 days and yet they cannot run their service any better than they presently are?  That is an absurd notion.

Unfortunately whether we embrace something or not if it survives its trials and tribulations its likely here to stay for better or worse.  It would be most unfortunate if bitoin was as ruthlessly dominated as most other currencies are.

Yup, given their attitude of not wanting to talk about any of the real issues and banning anyone from IRC that actually attempts to have a discussio.  I wonder if they are up to shady things like frontrunning or are simply incredibly incompitent and unwilling to admit it.
One would hope considering the impact Mtgox has on bitcoin that they would reach out to the community to make their service better.
