Brawl = physical contact from pink tie guy who gets personal when bitcoin discussion gets serious.  Our CNBC hosts stood up for their BTC buddy here TL:DR -there was no brawl
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:53:00
just do it already - you are an industry leader?   or a Bcash shill?   better pick fast......
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:02:02
Yes KFC!  Kentucky Fried bitCoin!
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:59:00
absolutly brutal coinbase - this should be totally embarassing - are you the industry unicorn and leader? or Bcash shill and bitcoin (BTC) vampire?   
be careful when biting the hand that feeds you..  after a while it gets old....  there will be alternatives.

If anyone (including your dad) talked you out of it - you were not sold.   (please forgive your Dad - you only have one!)
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:06:29
yes Bcash needs its own wallet (and identity) for sure !!!
Merry Christmass Jihan!! we agree 100%
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:33:22
it would be nice if they dumped their BCash and added to their Bitcoin stash with the proceeds..... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:09:09
so sad they didn't have the fuck you picture up....
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:50:30
Ver is done after this pump ... I hope.   have your Bcash and watch it quietly die - its nothing different than other coins that have no integrity,
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:56:03
yea that ETH Russian kid has everything under control - where do I sign up. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:06
BCH is toxic poison to the entire ecosystem.   
I am not against all alt coins at all.   Just Ver and Jihan's Bcash monstrosity.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:15:41
are you guys talking about Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:49
Agree 100%
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:21:17
I dumped ALL my Bcash And Bitcoin fools Gold first day my awesome Trezor made it easy for me to. I  rolled all proceeds into more BTC.    I have checked the math over various checkpoints.....   still way ahead with my decision by a good margin.   
Ver is toxic ....  Bcash is a shitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:42:40
AMAZING !!!  WOW thank you Pineapplefund - this is wicked!  
The true spirit of the real Bitcoin BTC!
@_date: 2018-09-15 02:09:04
dude;Transactable, settlement network that can process 500,000 transactions/day
&lt;this ??  nowhere near anything that can become a reserve currency?   are you taking any drugs - or too young to understand what your "publishing"
This is not accurate and you look like your stating some "facts" in this article....  500K transactions a day is not even any-fucking-near close to a "reserve currency" 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:36:04
yea I watched a couple episodes in advance of the Bitcoin episode..... and my expectations were low..... real low.   Do people actually watch this shit?   ..... I guess they do???
Cool a popular show made an episode about bitcoin I guess...
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:11:54
but are you a "self made millionaire" with no class?!!! thats the real question /s

well the concept and the idea is alive - just think - imagine - by John Lenon.....
how could you make a war if BTC was the global currency.....  I guess you could, but it wouldn't be so easy.
@_date: 2019-03-21 02:16:42
ohh I like that!!!!! how much BTC does it cost??? take my money
@_date: 2019-03-21 02:18:09

@_date: 2018-10-16 06:25:45

yea but 200/400$ - 3K ain't bad......  I look back and love that period of time where I bought like a mad man between 200 &amp; 400 USD.  
sadly I lost it all on hookers and casinos....
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:44:38

I Don’t care  - you condone sick shit to happen on the internet if you really want to see this.

It’s sick
It’s gross
It’s not human

@_date: 2019-02-20 02:59:35
this could be the STARt of the next "coin run" (bank run pun).  "people all over are flocking to coinstar machines and feeding in coins for BTC as financial crisis looms. "    We asked one person in line what they though about the 25% conversion rate and they commented "I just want something that I actually own - I can't get Bitcoin anywhere else right now - my bank is down - ATMs are empty or frozen..... ".
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:40:52
you are missing the point dude.   8M, 16M none of it will scale enough to really be a world wide "visa/digital cash"
And personally - I don't give a shit.   I am am not buying coffee with my bitcoin...   I did that a couple years ago with newegg to buy a server ....  and it turns out I could haver an obsolete computer or 20K$.    I kinda burns every time I think about it..... so you think about that....
BCH is a joke trying to centralize BTC.      A fool and is BTC will soon be parted....
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:50:32
how cool would it be for the Winklevoss twins to come on the scene and dump their BCH and use proceeds to buy BTC during one of these attacks. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:10:29
Go for it - Bitcoin BTC is king (I feel ashamed for my little bit of doubt -lol -in hindsight of course)

@_date: 2018-02-22 05:02:29
It is cute they are giving a nod to Bitcoin (crypto). It's kinda like saying - your internet seems okay, but our intranet will rule and is backed by copper!

THIS!  validation/confirmation..... not bad at all.   Bank trusted security for noobs who do not know BTC's inherent security..... well they are just the early  adopters......

are bitcoin forks the new ICO?  how do these fools get the air time to pull this off?   (not including S2X - I kinda get that "initiative").    I am not shilling and am dead serious here.   how is Bitcoin Gold different than Vertcoin (other than VTC has been around since 2014 and didn't premine).  SO!!!! why is Bitcoin Gold even a thing?  did they spend a lot of advertising to make this fork happen?   who gave them the press time to do this?    did everyone sit back and say "Let's allow this ..... here comes some more free money like BCH (bitchcoin)? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:25:11
Bitcoin Gold does what better than Vertcoin (VTC)?
