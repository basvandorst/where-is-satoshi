Now I don't see what incentive they would have to not run with the money though. If they give all the money back, they'd still be dead as an exchange. Nobody would trust them again.
Unlike a bank they don't have to follow much regulation, so they don't risk so much legally.

Yes, make sure to keep that $0.0000045, it's an investment. Imagine if BTC doubles, you'd have $0.000009!!

Get the money?


It's not a bank. I'm not really sure that they have much legal risk even if they don't have the money.
It's funny how lots of people in are all against government, taxes, and regulations, but they expect regulations and legal pursuits when someone steals BTC.

When I say run, I don't mean go away and hide. I just meant take the money and shut down MtGox.
They'd have to hide from the angry users though.

Yes, only yours, because basically every basic economics book will disagree.
In a deflationary system, the rich have much less incentive to invest their money. They have the option of letting it there, growing. Therefore they lend it less, with higher interest rates.
If you have a 2% deflation, you're going to compare all investments against that standard. So, if you think an investment (given its risk) should get you 3% more than money, you're going to lend at 5%.
For the poor it's bad news, because they cannot borrow as easily. All the projects with that amount of risk and that cannot grow more than 5% a year will not get done.
For the rich it's quite good, because it reduces a lot the risk they take to get their money growing.
Deflation increases the value of money over time. Obviously it's good news for those who can store large amounts of it, not for the ones who don't.
It reduces economic activity, and increases wealth disparity.

That's correct, that's actually a major problem with the idea of using BTC as a national currency.
The Euro right now experiences inflation, not deflation.

I agree, a big concern I have about bitcoin is that the more I read about economics, the more I'm convinced that a deflationary currency is damaging for the economy and for society in general.
I see lots of people here explaining and debating on points that stand in the way of bitcoin being a widely used currency, but personally I don't think it's beneficial that it becomes too widely used. 
It's beneficial in the short term and for individuals, but negative globally.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:36:12
No, it increases buying power for the one who hold it. When you've spent it, you don't benefit from the value increase.

More importantly; is there a relatively simple solution for using a secure wallet without downloading the 13GB blockchain (and keeping it synced)?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:21:41
 too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:36:43
The Federal Reserve don't "print money", they trade new money for government bonds that the banks already own.
Also, they don't do it with "unlimited power" just for their benefit, they use it to adjust the interest rates to reach the best growth they can, without making inflation too high that it surpass the increase of productivity.
This is also why a deflationary currency gives huge interest rates, and slows growth a lot (or reverse it).

But that purely because people don't bother learning the new version, and because there are still a few packages that haven't migrated (after 5 years…). But they're shooting themselves in the foot, they'll have to migrate later.

You shouldn't judge actions based on their result, but on all their possible results and their probability.
Just because it worked doesn't mean it was clever. Just because it failed doesn't mean it was stupid.

True, deflation makes interests rates go way up in turn also. It's quite logical, you need a much larger interest for lending money if just letting it sit idle earns you value already. Inflation drives interest rates down. Inflation makes people invest their money, lend it, and that drives the economy.
Inflation is also a tax on piles of money, a tax on the rich that gets redistributed. It taxes people who have loads of money and don't do anything with it, leave it useless for the economy. With deflation, you have the opposite result.
So less growth, less jobs, less economic activity, and more inegalities.

Thanks for the recommendation, I'm saving it. That being said, it's apparently a very partisan book, so it's likely that it's not to be taken as the total truth and proven facts but more of an opinion piece. Still worth reading, but along with some books from other points of view.

Helping to launder money is illegal, and what incentive would someone clean have to make his money dirty?

In France it looks like the capital gain is taxed at your revenue tax bracket plus 15.5%. So for example that would be 30.5% for someone who earn more (with their job) than $12k net per year, and 45.5% for more than €26k net. It would be up to 60.5% for those who already earn more than €150k net per year (but well, that's a huge salary already).
I don't understand why Germany doesn't apply a tax rate after one year; it seems that it's not the case for other commodities, so what's special about BTC?

That's the whole point.
Say I have ~~money~~ value. I want to keep it. More than that, I want to get it as big as I can, but at least keep it. One extreme solution is to keep it in money. Another extreme solution is to put it all on very risky investments (since risk is what pays).
In practice, I will choose the reasonable amount of risk corresponding to the possible return. Of course it depends on my particular situation, but we're able to get some good statistical average.
Now, if there's inflation, it means that the "safe" extreme (all in money) will mean a decrease of value. Therefore, I have more incentive to risk that value more to make it grow. I will tend to choose more risk for more return, which will make me put that value to work by lending it, stimulating the economy. The interests rates go down.
If there's deflation, my value increase with 0 risk already. If I were to take a risk with my value, it would need to be justified by a much larger possible return. So the interest rates increase, which has a negative effect for the economy. 
I will judge any possible investment compared to the inflation/deflation rate. If there's 2% deflation, you need to propose a return rate superior to that for it to be interesting to lend you value. If there's 2% inflation, you need to propose a rate superior to -2% (in value, not in money). That's how you judge an interest rate; the difference with the inflation/deflation rate, compared to the amount of risk.
So the point isn't to say that with deflation we won't buy anymore. It's that deflation make interest rates go up.
And interest rates that increase slow down the economy, but that's another discussion.

But Bitcoin isn't cash, and wouldn't be protected like it.
I see that most of the reactions here are just an outrage, but I think that's really missing the point. People say that Bitcoin is an experiment, well, here is part of it.
The point is that it's possible to do it, and it's certainly tempting too. If the police knows that one bitcoin was robbed, wouldn't it make sense to track where it was spent to find the guy? Wouldn't it make sense to track transactions to find which addresses belong to whom, to try and find tax avoidance?
I'm not saying it goes in the way people here want to think of Bitcoin, but it's possible and makes sense that it will be used. Bitcoin's blockchain is public, this kind of project with it is part of the experiment, and people here should be interested to discuss what's possible with it and what it implies.

Hem. Caricatural.


If it's possible to kill it just with a small proof of concept like that, then it's maybe not the best invention ever and is clearly deeply flawed.

In most exchanges (at least all the serious and legal ones), to open an account you're required to provide a copy of your ID and proof of residence. What do you think that's used for?

Most current alternatives to bitcoin are just like it though. The most successful, Litecoin, is basically a fork of bitcoin made by people who were disappointed to have missed the early days of easy mining before it took off. It doesn't bring anything, the only change is the mining algorithm so that these same people can mine without upgrading their computer.

If the bills you exchange are dirty, it is.


You assume people care about this. People don't risk their resources for the politics of their money. And a money that relies on people taking risks and engaging in illegal activity isn't a good money.
Basically I'm not going to risk problems with my coins just to make yours cleaner.

The point of a space program or AIDS research isn't to show that it can work without funding. But the point of bitcoin is to have a money that doesn't require cooperation from goverments and companies.
Many people here used to see bitcoin as a tool on which governments and companies can't get any control. Now, it seems that we consider that for bitcoin to work, governments have to play nice with it. That defeats the whole point.
