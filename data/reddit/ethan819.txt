Isn't that like saying "I would like to donate some CAD in USD"

If they were the only one with the key, it becomes inaccessible, just like if anyone lost their key. They are still part of the 21-million, but they don't go anywhere. However, the beauty is, as long as there is a finite number left, no matter how small, you can split that up into an infinite number of pieces. Just add more zeroes after the decimal point.

But what are silver and gold backed by?
@_date: 2016-06-30 01:17:30
Ok, that makes more sense.
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:49:34
Nice metaphor.
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:10:10
Um... No.
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:14:39
Yeah, I bought at $650... Then $640... Then $635... 
But yeah, it hasn't reached $990 within the last 3 years

It makes the graph more accurate, since measuring 10,000 Bitcoin in 2013 and 10,000 Bitcoin today as the same figure doesn't make sense.

VPN usage would also be grounds for a warrant, since it is also technology used to hide your location.

That is just the commission they take, it says nothing about the price. You don't have to be such a dick about it. They could take a 4% commission on sales and sell Bitcoin at A$800.

It's not YOUR money, it's your customer's money. You don't deserve to just keep it, what makes you any better then those committing fraud if you yourselves are taking people's money?
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:34:52
Wow, it just dropped $30 :0

Darknet markets seem to be doing pretty well...
@_date: 2016-06-07 04:40:52
I think it makes people gain interest, makes it seem like a better investment psychologically.

They can't track you backwards, I.E. trace what a TOR user is doing and control his computer, instead they find any IP using technology such as TOR or a VPN and can legally obtain access to that computer.

And here I am, glad if I find $20 in my pocket.
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:11:09
I'm assuming because we finally broke the 3,000 Yuan and 500 USD ceilings again.

It can definitely still expand. Just because it is the most popular digital currency doesn't mean there isn't room to grow, as a small percentage of people have ever used any digital currencies at all. Bitcoin is slowly gaining popularity every day, with digital currencies reaching more people.

Cool, thanks for pointing that out. The only problem I see now is misleading titles...
But seriously, cool idea. I already made some (testnet) btc.
@_date: 2016-05-18 14:32:39
Yeah, Bitcoin is getting more and more stable, so it's becoming a better and better option. Sure, it might plummet, but it could also skyrocket. (The chances of either are pretty low.)
@_date: 2016-05-18 16:28:38
Is it out of testnet mode now?
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:16:40
That must have taken some strong willpower, kudos to you for having it.

Google has search personalization.
@_date: 2016-05-16 15:09:18
It would be cool if there was a way to browse.

Or doesn't know how investing works...
