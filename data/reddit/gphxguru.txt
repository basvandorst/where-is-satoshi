Is that site still working on your computer? I love that site but it seems to be down these last couple of days, but maybe somethings wrong with my computer/browser...

Alright thanks, got it working again. Virus scanner was the cause.

Very nice!

Yeah. Same opinion here. A correction from the rapid rise these past 2 months, mixed with some negative media attention and panic sellers. Relax, and keep your coins.

Me too, but at a certain point it stopped working on bitonic. First time i bought there (i'm from Belgium) i immediately got a personal call from ING 20 minutes after i made the transaction asking me if i bought those. Really scary that they monitor those things so fast. I bought mine at BTCDirect recently which didn't gave me any problems when i paid with ING.

It's not a stress test mate, it's just plain spamming...

Yeah same here, Nitrogensports.eu. Probably some other around there, but i've used Nitrogensports a couple of times and was pleasantly surprised with the overall experience.

Saw the same thing. It was just a small selling transaction from 159$ that made the price appear like that for just a few seconds. Pretty confusing.

Don't worry, acknowledging something that he probably doesn't understand yet isn't easy...

BTCDirect or Bitonic in Belgium.

Cool stuff man! Very inspiring!

Love it, i've been using them for over 7 years and i've never had any complains about them. But since i don't had a visa card it was always quite annoying to put some money into my account. So i'm really glad with this development!
