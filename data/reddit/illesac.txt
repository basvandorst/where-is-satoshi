Don't stress obtaining this information it's all lies anyways.  Like how they were telling people they had their own segregated addresses.  I sent 2 BTC to Bitfinex on July 27 and 2 days later that address had another 2.46 added before it was swept on Aug 2.  It's all lies, I'd be surprised if Zane if even a real person's name at this point.

You need to go back to the CFTC settlement and figure out why Bitfinex is only a platform for p2p margin trading, not a pool for margin trading.  There is no reaching into the wallets of those not stolen from.  It likes a bank vault, you don't go into the other vaults and divvy up to loot evenly.  Super unfair but that is the problem with regulators telling you how to run your business.

Good god you're an evolved human to take the high road and deliver a high quality response.  So I agree that not all (probably even a high majority) of derivatives are part of a healthy marketplace in an attempt to mitigate risk but it is the existence of these Frankenstein derivatives that danger the entire system.  The question I think we're both then trying to answer is how do you evaluate/record the decision making process to avoid the black hole of ignorance.  I don't see how the underwriting, rating, and reselling of derivatives isn't basically a financial Milgram experiment and we know that humans cannot just do the right thing when told by an authority.  Since you are well versed in the subject how do you stop finance from creating Frankensteins without stifling risk mitigation tools?  The only tools I can think of involve regulatory bans that are anti-free-market such as not allowing tranches where everything must stay bundled or limiting the reselling of these Frankenstein parts which eliminates the feedback necessary to mark-to-market (which they wouldn't do for the public but you know damn well they look at internally).  Regardless good day to you and happy Friday.

The goal is not to undermine the protection of the consumer but the reduction of unnecessary oversight from the equation.  By leveraging public addresses and their associated transactions an "unlicensed" service provider could quickly prove their credibility with the blockchain.

The US seems to be running at Bitcoin with open arms (without officially causing a stampede by announcing its adoption) while China and Russia are closing the door.  I believe the East is much more worried than the West about capital controls and have much more to lose if that's the case.  Yes I believe there will be great manipulation in the price with the upcoming new cycles but like SMTP you can't kill a protocol.

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter, dealing another blow to the embattled marketplace for buyers and sellers of the virtual currency.
Mt. Gox, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, shut down on Tuesday, underscoring the risks of bitcoin, the virtual currency that has seen a meteoric rise in the past year. The subpoena was sent this month and asked Mt. Gox to preserve certain documents among other things, the person said.

I think Bitcoin is already more convenient that paying with cash (more hygienic, no need to count change) or swiping a card (here have access to my whole account and take only what we agreed upon) but it is the store of value thing that turns people away.

I think what you're missing in my extreme example is that this auction is the opportunity for a very large multinational company to acquire the resources necessary to make a dive into being the face of Bitcoin payments.  I know we've got Coinbase and Bitpay but to the average person I might as well tell them I'm trading digitals 0s and 1s at Magic the Gathering Online Exchange.  The legitimacy that a known company is shelling out millions for some coins will give the boost you seem to think won't manifest when this hits the WSJ/FT.  And yes if Google or Apple or Facebook bought the coins then they already have the payment platform, it's called Bitcoin FYI.

Key recovery, or the ability to retrieve backups of encryption keys under carefully defined conditions, can be a crucial part of certificate management (depending on how an organization uses certificates). Key recovery schemes usually involve an m of n mechanism: for example, m of n managers within an organization might have to agree, and each contribute a special code or key of their own, before a particular person's encryption key can be recovered. This kind of mechanism ensures that several authorized personnel must agree before an encryption key can be recovered.

It's a double edge sword in terms of trying to bring such an open/accessible platform while preserving integrity.  Although I'm sure the team has thought about it more than me I think the right data with the correct tools to everyone involved (consumers and vendors) will eventually lead to a robust system that is more beneficial to join than to try and scam.  
While anyone should be able to buy or sell anything, I as a consumer should be able to require any form of vendor verification before making a purchase.  If vendors don't want to supply this information they're still allowed to act in the bazaar but inform me as the consumer that I'm dealing with a unverified vendor.  I can take my business elsewhere if I'm worried about the vendor.
For those vendors dealing goods that are currently frowned upon by the local gang running their town an escrow service is about the only option due to the nature of the internet, the use of sockpuppets, and the frictionless action of Bitcoin.  Proof of burn just means you paid x for this reputation and one-to-one transactions just means lots of bots creating new accounts to trade between each other trying to outrun your flagging criteria.  I wish there were a way to look into someone's eyes before a transaction because those have never failed me but we're in the digital world so we'll just have to make due with the data we have.

Someone's risking a minuscule % of a point to trade between accounts in hopes of receiving the rewards.  It's probably a big whale trying to learn the system to determine when the checkpoints are triggered.  In such a thin market they should be able to quickly learn BTCChina's reward system being the only actor.  Why do this?  Going forward they could time small buys that would win the reward with a fair amount of confidence.
If liquidity comes back to BTCChina this proposition of self trading becomes less  guaranteed as someone else may either beat you to the winning trade and your coins may be bought at a bottom and you won't have a chance to reenter.

I think price inflation is more concerning given their dominance for the past several years.  On the flip side the demand that will be unleashed if the 700k coins people thought they had are in fact evaporated will certainly push the price up.  At the end of the day Mt. Gox appears to be a giant ruse perpetuated by the Bitcoin Foundation to push the price of Bitcoin "to the Moon" while keeping their individual holdings safe.  I hadn't thought about this until replying and now contemplating it for a few minutes I don't see why this wasn't the perfect scam.
1. Create/corrupt a Bitcoin exchange company to trade the digital coins whose market you've essentially cornered.
2. Inflate the price of your digital coin via exchange
3. ???
4. Profit
In this case the ??? is insider talking and being aware of when it is time to change the bot from buy to sell.  Each time this happened anyone with insider information could effectively front run Mt. Gox on a legal exchange and acquire more and more coins as they are able to time their buys and sells almost perfectly.
The implications are staggering if true.  Think about how quickly you can turn insider info into millions with no work and barely any risk.  You can easily perform this magic with as little as $5,000 and only 4 trades!!!  
Buy 1000 BTC @ $5 - this was about the average price mid-2012
Sell 1000 BTC @ $250 - realistic selling price pre-4/8 knowing Mt. Gox about to suffer "DDos"
Buy 5000 BTC @ $50 - average price during "bottom" knowing Gox is about to recover
Sell 5000 BTC @ $1,000 - not even near the high, could have liquidated even higher
Imagine what could have happened if someone put $50,000 or $500,000 behind this scheme and really tried to maximize profit during each swing.  In the simple case above each scammers made $5,000,000 from the initial $5,000 investment in less than 2 years.  What happens if this scam was 2x, 10x, or even 100x this size?  The numbers get big quick and there were plenty of opportunities to make these trades without raising major suspicion.
I'm sick to my stomach because I love the technology but I don't like the way this smells.  All non-cold storage holding are being liquidated; however, I plan on keeping my current alt portfolio.

The closed ecosystem means coins never get sold so a bigger Bitcoin ecosystem results in less coin available for exchange.  On an exchange traders consider the depth of the order books when making investment decisions.  
Or more simply...
A decrease supply results in an increase in prices.
An increase in demand results in an increase in prices.
A decrease in supply and an increase in demand = moon.

The price is dropping and probably will continue to drop because there are 25 BTC being mined every 10 minutes.  Those miners have electricity costs and the network must support those costs.  We simply don't have enough money flowing into the system to support high costs and at the same time many people believe miners are being overpaid.  In both scenarios the price drops.

You're telling me that if Google  bought the coins above market value while announcing a payment network built around Google+ (make the feds happy with KYC) that the price wouldn't instantly rise?  How about I throw in a kicker and say that with their announcement of the winning bid they release their internal evaluations that the bits that made up each coin were worth 1/10 of a cent, making each coin worth $100,000.  Would this spark a bubble?  Still holding onto your precious no response?  Let me help you throw in the towel to your horrible statement.  With these announcements a policy is released that Google will purchase any bits from identified sources at or below their internal evaluation price.  While you may faint at the idea of $100,000/Bitcoin a company who makes $40,000,000/day AFTER all expenses including taxes isn't even going to flinch at spending 30 days profit to adsorb the entire payment network although we all know they wouldn't get offered half the coins available.

FACT:  The block reward at 3929999 is not 1 satoshi, it is ~0.00100000 which would be 100,000 satoshi.
ASSUMPTION: BTC is worth 1,000,000 in 2070.  How the fuck did you get this?  Has the Fed stopped printing $85,000,000,000/month?  Does the US gov't have a balanced budget?  The fact you're even trying to think of BTC in terms of USD says you don't understand what's going at all in the slightest.

Solid response can't point to any flaws in your logic and I don't know the details of your personal dealings so I'm steering clear of that ship.

Compared to nonexperts, expert sources have been considered to elicit more processing of persuasive messages because of expectations that the information is likely to be valid or accurate. However, depending on the position of an advocacy, source expertise could activate other motives that may produce a very different relation from that found in past research. When messages are counterattitudinal (disagreeable), experts should motivate greater processing than nonexpert sources because of expectations that they will likely provide robust opposition to one’s existing views. In contrast, when advocacies are proattitudinal (agreeable), nonexpert rather than expert sources should elicit more scrutiny because of perceptions that they will likely provide inadequate support to recipients’ current views. Two studies offer evidence consistent with these predictions. Manipulations of source expertise created different expectations regarding the strength of opposition or support, and these perceptions accounted for effects of source expertise on the amount of message scrutiny.

Every person on Earth allocates their own time.  With that time we can either consumer, stand still, or create.  When we create, value is subsequently created but how we keep track of that value is subjective.  With crypto we'll be able to more finely delineate value that's tracked throughout society much better that the current signals we have that move much more slowly.

If you were hear a couple years ago you've gotten a hundred responses.  I'm not the best at this but since you're an old Reddit user I'll try to help and feel free to ask me more.
1) Yes each cryptocurrency has their own, that is what makes them unique.  "The blockchain" was the hot buzzword from the banker world last year where they thought the power of Bitcoin was only the distributed ledger aspect of the technology.
2) My favorite video regarding this has been removed.  A Google search will result in plenty but the problem with most of these ideas is that they are better served from a centralized service.  Blockchains' real value come from their immutable decentralized data characteristics that are stored globally but there is a real cost to replicating and storing that data on every node.
3) Just because you have a encrypted record stored on a public blockchain doesn't mean you can decrypt without the key.  Not sure where you'd be adding value to whatever process you're imaging.
4) I think you're referring to [ICOs](  Please don't invest in one of these until you're okay losing your deposit, nothing has more potential worth long-run than XBT.

You should separate the conversation between technology and value proposition when you encounter this sort of writing off.  Admit defeat on value proposition from the start.  This is easy since you can just say "it's too new" to price correctly but it's worth understanding and discuss the technological impacts.  If you can get them to the point where they understand BitRerserve and accept we have a global permissionless ledger you can eventually come back around to scarcity of the inputs.

You're worried for no reason.  What will they do start their own coin?  How will it be mined?

So he's wrong about PoW but opinions on why PoS is bad?  The two leading arguments I've seen:
* Zero cost of staking multiple chains so "concensus" is not pure as in a PoW where you assume no one would spend time/money mining an orphaned chain
* Distribution is skewed and entry can only be gained from existing stakeholders.  You effectively cannot "work" your way into the system if the cost of a coin is too high.
EDIT: I've read the ["On Stake and Consensus"] ( paper but not convinced as problems cited are already solved by next-gen PoS that take into account network latency and universal timestamping.
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:49:45
Until a POS coin breaks you're going to have huge pushback from the low energy crowd.  Why be in an arms race to prevent an attack that can't happen?

Not sure which coins you're referencing but I do believe some of these issues are solved.  Performing an initial distribution through PoW and switching to PoS after distribution looks and smells like consensus to me.  There still exists the problem of nothing to lose for mining forked chains but I'd like to think there is a solution for that as well.  As for universal time-stamping I'd look to NEM solution that establishes a baseline and checks variances without a centralized service as you're correct that any centralized service even if just a time-stamper will eventually be regulated (aka shutdown).

I agree that a majority of the % points of the '14 bubble were fueled by Chinese exchanges.  This was facilitated by margin trading but the key pivots of the market were always orchestrated/led whatever you want to call it by Gox.  It would not go down when the market wanted to perform a pullback and would blow through key resistance levels like it was it's job (which it may have been).

@_date: 2015-04-19 14:50:14
I agree that the fear of dump does not exist but I think the run-up in price was due to some sort of Mt. Gox shenanigans...either trying to trade their way out of fractional reserve or the person pulling this theft off could only do it by purchasing Bitcoin on Gox thus leading the price wave for every other exchange.

Changes were made to the client to decrease the standard transaction fee.  (10x decrease in fees update last year - 
Why was this done?  Increased exchange value and we'll do it again if transaction fees become too high.  The miners are fighting over who gets to process the transactions.  Let me know when the hash power is below the previous years hashing power then we may have to change the reward structure.

The Bitcoin network in the most simple terms is a public ledger. 
Every ledger line is owned by an address and controlled by a unique key.  These keys and addresses are important because ownership of an asset can be transferred over the internet in a publicly verifiable way without a dedicated third party.  
What's so very important to convey is we now have a new base layer technology that we're only beginning to explore it's functionality.  To imagine what type of products this online public will lead to is like imagining Netflix, Spotify, Facebook and Google after signing onto your first BBS.
If people can make it this far and still want to know more or say so what the topics to include are: mining, inflation, the blockchain, signing a message/multi-sig

Bitcoin the system is a digital ledger.
All ledgers have entries or ledger lines.
A ledger line is a "satoshi" in the Bitcoin system.

Not following.  In my mind uncontrollable, unsustainable government fiat = bad, Bitcoin = good.  The extreme scenario has only government employees working for government fiat and the private enterprise trading with those government workers for fiat to pay their taxes.  The more likely scenario is new responsible government fiat is developed and Bitcoin is a supplementary form of asset allocation.

I don't think additional decimals will ever be used because it breaks one of the fundamentals of the protocol.  The limit was set to be withing the limit of the largest possible integer that can be exactly represented in floating point format.  I think given the current number of accounting units 2,100,000,000,000,000(2.1 quadrillion, or about 2^50.899) there is plenty of bandwidth to absorb all of the world's wealth.  Even if Bitcoins became the most expensive asset in the world and say 1 Satoshi is worth $100 then "change" would be handled through an alt coin like Litecoin.

Not sure how you can say with any accuracy that "Merchants cannot rely on a wildly fluctuating medium of exchange" when Coinbase offers a feature in their checkout process that automatically converts at the current rate.

1. Do they understand/trust the technology? Most people I talk to about Bitcoin don't understand basic cryptography enough to even trust that Bitcoin will do what Bitcoin is coded to do.  Without this foundation everything that Bitcoin makes possible sounds too pie in the sky.
2. Bitcoin is coming.  Whether they like it or not Bitcoin is coming and because there is no central authority there is no point in trying to stop it (lobbying).
3. Most important for them.  Given the facts around Bitcoin how can they best position themselves from this growing trend?  Also, would point out existing companies in the ecosystem (Coinbase, Bitpay, etc.) to explain their competition in case one of them started thinking they were going to be first to the market with some service.

Transactions happens instantly.  Confirmations are what take time.  You're asking to spend money that hasn't yet been accepted by the blockchain.
As public addresses are used more frequently trust will be established that the address pays.  For small transactions you let the person obtain a good or service, their wallet says they have enough XBT and they have over 4k similar transactions.  Buying a car, house, business...yeah better let the blockchain validate that transaction.   Beats trying to count all those 100s in cash.

End users will only be using light wallets while the miners will still download the entire blockchain.  As mining will become more and more of an industry there isn't a worry about their connection speed being too slow.  Lastly if an entity 51% attacked the network it would be realized and Bitcoin would cease to function as a trusted medium of exchange.  This in essence would effectively do more harm than good for the attacker because their hardware is worthless now that the Bitcoin blockchain is not trusted.
