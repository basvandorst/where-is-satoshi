Yes it already exists. I forget the URL, but it's something like mastadon social network :)

Can someone ban this guy for talking about alt coins?

Sorry man. That's my opinion :/

1300 USD and people still defend cores choice to not increase the block size. Your coins are un moveable. I hope for your sake they do come up with a cheap way to move currency, but for the moment both our coins are stuck in limbo. A really sad state for an industry disrupting technology.

Use less expletives and exclamations.

I find it helpful. The section on wallets is super helpful. And the confusion about Bitcoin cash (the alt) vs. Bitcoin is smaller than what everyone makes it out to be, imho
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:23
No, we don't want it there either thanks.:(

What is that?

What is the 21 club?

**PSA** Looks like its back :)
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:01:23
Thanks :) Do you think all the hodlers pose a threat to that business plan? Each Bitcoin they cashout could be a steep loss.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:54:09
Aye!! Fellow Hodler here, I absolutely agree with you.
I'm on board, and I wish core and BU could come to consensus, it doesn't even matter what that consensus is! We will be able to fix all the technical problems that Bitcoin faces in time, but Bitcoin needs to last (and optimally, retain it's value) until those fixes are made.
I think discussions like this make that communication that we want peace to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Hodl and unite brothers and sisters.

Thanks for the reply, that's really informative.

coinbase's bitcoin ticker was down for about an hour or so. It's back online now though.
Did i miss anything?
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:25:50
Why would we want our sweet loot on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:11:03
Noob here. What's going on there?
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:53:49
Wow, that's so cool.
Do you think they immediately sold after the spike happened?
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:31:14
I love that the price graph is literally coming out of the phone. A+ execution :)
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:47:29
Awesome, thank you I'll check then out!

Well, America launched missiles on Syria, could that be it?

Insteresting read. 1 thing I disagree on:  
1 million bitcoins IS personal gain

Can we get a flow chart on whether or not to build off of your flow chart?
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:01:57
You could have it cheaper, but you don't want it to be cheaper. You are the problem.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:01:58
It's actually the opposite. 
Inflation is where money becomes less powerful over time. Deflation is where money becomes more powerful over time.
This shows how Bitcoin becomes more valuable as time goes on, right?

Only a sith deals in absolutes. 
Let me ask you this; since tx fees have been trending upward. At what point will you *begin* to think they are too high? $5, $10, $50, $100+?. As more people use the system the price will only increase. We need to address the price/wait issues now.
  
Additionally I would like Bitcoin to succeed. But if the tx fees are higher than the cost of my purchase (let's say a coffee) I cannot justify using it. Bitcoin will be more successful if it is better than fiat in all situations.  
  
So right now, yes Bitcoin is better than Western Union. But it's not cheaper/better than my bank for micro-transactions- which I would like it to be. I'm certain you can agree with this, right ?

Q: You know what else sends out data that is stored on thousands of other locations all over the planet?  
  
A: Reddit.  
And it's also free. (Tons of other services too)   
  
You tried to make it seem impressive and hard and cost worthy, but it's not. It should be cheaper. All the other cryptocurrencies have the same problem but they can do it cheaper.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:31:32
Gosh. As soon as someone disagrees with you you label them as "destroying Bitcoin".  
Now, you are right that they are different architectures.
I was illustrating that it is traditionally cheap to send and store small amounts of data, and Bitcoin is no different.
