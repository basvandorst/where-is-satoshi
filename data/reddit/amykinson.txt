What else is he known for? That's just a few lines a month of code.

Do I need a "serious" tag?

Didn't Chainalysis implement the tx reject messages so clients knew their transactions didn't go through?

A bit rich of Peter Todd to accuse Chainalysis of criminal conduct when he himself has admitted to sybil attacking the Bitcoin network on multiple occasions. Examples: his scalability talk at the Boston MIT Bitcoin Expo, his anti-zeroconf crusade, his anti-bloom-filter/SPV efforts, etc.

What about a new opcode? Like a OP_CHECKSIGDOUBLE?

Any estimates on how much that defense against replace-by-fee mining would bloat the blockchain?

Jeff Garzik has some great quotes:
"Peter's scorched earth replace-by-fee proposal is aptly named, and would be widely anti-social on the current network."
"scorched earth" refers to the _real world_ impact such policies would have on present-day 0-conf usage within the bitcoin community."
"{Peter Todd's work} isn't some theoretical exercise.  Like it or not many use
insecure 0-conf transactions for rapid payments.  Deploying something that makes 0-conf transactions unusable would have a wide, negative impact on present day bitcoin payments, thus "scorched earth"
**"Without adequate decentralized solutions for instant payments, deploying replace-by-fee widely would simply push instant transactions even more into the realm of centralized, walled-garden services."**
