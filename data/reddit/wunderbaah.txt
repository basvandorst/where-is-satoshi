Consider how dumb the average person is, though... they have no idea that inflation (THEFT!) is slowly eating away their dollars while Uncle Sam is laughing all the way to the bank (in this case, the FED). The stock marked is crashing HARD. As soon as people realize how worthless their unbacked, fundamentally worthless FIAT is they will flock to crypto like the sheep that they are. Let them pay higher prices (I estimate bitcoin will be at 30k by the time the outdated stock market crashes) to the STRONG HANDS who have kept crypto alive for the last 10 years. They can eat their ramen and take the bus  while we early adopters drive our lambos and save the world with the new crypto economy.

Bitcoin is not a failed invention like the things you listed, though. It's more like the internet in 1990. Lightning Network is going to be yet another game-changer for the world.

No, that is the only quilt store in town BUT the second largest grocery store is now accepting LN, and I talked to three coffee shops today who seemed VERY interested when I explained the advantages (and did a little red pilling about fiat while I was at it). They use Square right now but I explained about Twitter banning crypto ads (and how the president of both companies is banning crypto ads so he can start his own currency without competition). Long story short, they are ditching square and moving to 100% LN (and even discouraging fiat!).

I hear Tesla’s drive themselves so I might buy one of those too since I’ll need to be checking my crypto investments while I drive to the country club LOL! By the way, Tesla’s are BUILT on blockchain tech. Elon himself owns bitcoin and is a secret supporter of the bitcoin project. TESLA be the first 100 million bitcoin company by 2020.

How many ICOs have you participated in? I have participated in 2. How many hours a day do you spend studying blockchain? I spend 1 hour a day. How many coin projects have you participated in? I am advising on 3 different projects right now. One will revolutionize how the health care community distributes employee discounts via an on chain coupon/discount system with huge off chain ramifications as well. Another will not as revolutionary, but will disrupt Hollywood’s grasp on movie theaters. It uses an on-chain, one-to-many micro transaction system to charge per second of theater time. If you don’t like a movie, walk out and you only pay for the time spent I theater. It’s called Cinetoken. Look it up. We have BIG backers from Hollywood. So before you educate ME on the blockchain, let me educate YOU on your lack of knowledge and in depth analysis of such things. It is an emerging technology with many subtleties that not everyone can grasp. It’s ok, you will just be the ones without lambos, LOL! I will have one I each color.

Update from my mom (who called me yesterday asking about Lightning Network). She has now started helping her friends spin up LN nodes using a few old PCs their kids had. So far the hardest part has been getting Ubuntu going (luckily I’m able to text her commands and formatting so her syntax is good).

Yes CNBC and others monitor reddit for investor sentiment. If they see false lies and FUD spread by trolls they will think that bitcoin is not a good investment. The BIG money listens to this subreddit since we are the tastemakers for the entire crypto community. This is why policing our content is so important. If any false FUD or lies enter into the discussion than we are not putting our best foot forward to the community and therefore Wall Street and the big investor types who watch CNBC and other networks. If anyone has contacts with The Wall Street Journal please let me know because I am compiling a list of positive reddit comments to send to them. Hopefully they will publish them in an article about bitcoin and crypto currencies since they are one of the largest financial newspapers that old dinosaur stock market types read hoping to get the scoop in the next big investment to park their millions of dollars. This is especially true after the DOW markets and NASDACK have dramatically CRASHED this week and cryptos have traditionally been considered a safe investment haven by the large players. This is just the first of many cracks showing in the facade that is the SCAM FIAT markets and will soon come tumbling down as crypto is shown again and again and again to be the future of the world economies. I will say that since fiat is MATHEMATICALY PROVEN TO BE WORTHLESS, all of the so called “super power economies” (US, Canada, Russia, and China) are in fact worthless since they are run entirely on FIAT. The first economy to be 100% crypto will be the worlds first HYPERPOWER economy since it has intrinsic value based on immutability, trustless decentralization, and MATH. My recommendation would be to setup large government funded mining operations for bitcoin and buy power from neighboring countries with FIAT (it’s worthless so let them have it while we use it to create bitcoin and other cryptos). This is the way forward. This is the FUTURE. If you don’t agree then take your FUD and LEAVE!

PayPal did not work because it is based on a failing system (fiat)

I think you just demonstrated the issue with most blockchain solutions... You just proposed solutions that sound good to the uneducated listener, and then someone comes along who actually works in the field and explains why these aren’t needed, are impractical, or already exist. Most ICOs seem to be throwing blockchain at industries without actually taking the time to understand the challenges they’re facing. In a way it’s pretty arrogant.

I’m calling it: 10k by midnight tonight.

6k was the HARD bottom. We will easily be 30k by June.

There are no issues with bitcoin. Only remedies for a broken, scammy, insecure market based on worthless fiat. Please do not spread FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:13:50
The intrinsic value comes from the literally trillions of dollars that have been spend mining coins. I’ve researches this topic thoroughly and any statement otherwise is FUD.

It has been mathematically proven that holding is the best way to make money. It protects you from the whales. Think thit’s charts look bad? Zoom out! Now how do they look? Pretty good, right? You can’t get those returns from the fake stock market peddling Enron and Lehman Bros.

Please don’t spread FUD about Tether. The unsubstantiated rumors about the cease and desist order are nothing more than FUD at this point. There is NOTHING to them as far as I am concerned. Even if they are true, USDT is only a very very small part of bitcoins liquidity. It would be a very small dip until more exchanges accepted USD for those who still want to use alternative currencies (fiat).
@_date: 2018-03-28 05:36:35
Still have an hour and a half before the day is over. If anything 9k is low.

Right? Reading through this thread is hilarious... How is this cheaper or easier than accepting credit cards or PayPal?

If you don't have bitcoin you have no true buying power. You have no global reach. Have fun in your little world of fiat, my friend... us big boys will be out here making deals and getting things done to move humanity forward.

Why doesn't somebody start a project like Twitter but on the blockchain? It would solve such issues like these.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:28:06
Except for all the companies working on their own implementations like IBM and Oracle. They use a blockchain but don’t use Bitcoin.

I will not discuss my finances on a public forum. Let’s just say that I’m currently working with the Lambo dealership in my state to secure financing for a new Huracan. ;) I called them Friday and they haven’t taken me seriously yet. I am going to walk into their office Monday morning with my trezor and we’ll see who is laughing then! LOL! (It will be me)
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:38:58
Do we really have to call them lapps?
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:36:50
Yep that’s the one! They’re awesome people!
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:31:00
I called the dealer today to ask about financing but they won't take me seriously yet. I'm going to walk into their office Monday morning with my Trezor and see who is laughing then. :)

I would rather keep the rest of my fiat for investing in bitcoin. Besides, USD will be worthless soon and I will get a free lambo. :) Read about the concept of “good money pushes out bad”. I am spending my bad money (fiat) and keeping my good money (btc).

Bitcoin is still up 6,000% over the last five years. You can’t get that kind of return from your scammy, inflationary DOW and NASDACK, LOl!
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:22:59
1 btc is always 1 btc. The fluctuation of USD does not bother me. I do think that we need to encourage investments into bitcoin because it’s the responsible, fair thing to do. Once people are red pilled that their fiat is worthless they will want to join us in a truly valuable currency like bitcoin. The higher the price in USD, the more people are joining us and converting a useless asset into a useful one.

I have participated in MANY audits at my work. I work directly with the country auditor several times a month. The beauty of blockchain technology is that it’s literally impossible to lie about your accounts because every single transaction and balance is held on the chain. It’s immutable so you can’t fudge the books. What aren’t you understanding?
As an aside, I have been trying to red pill the accounting department to switch to an internal blockchain system. No luck yet, but I will wear them down eventually. :)
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:34:12
It’s economics 101
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:31:02
Audits are part of the old system that blockchain is replacing. You can see all of the transactions on the blockchain. Why do you need an audit to tell you what we already know? Okay, grandpa! LOL!

I believe what you’re experiencing now is the “capitulation” stage.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:27:06
True, and transactions are low enough that it’s working fine as a currency now... there’s just hardly anywhere to actually spend it, and no advantages over cash (unless you’re worried about censorship, whatever that means).

In the future, please frame bitcoins price as already high. For example you could say: “what event do you think has to happen to make btc *shoot up even further*”

That's a nice try, but Lambo doesn't make anything called a 488. Try again, kiddo.

It’s almost as if prices are dictated by a small group of people who control the most coins and there aren’t any market fundamentals at all.
