In theory, it could be done as a softfork, but the existing asic miners would have to agree to enforce the GPU PoW rules (as well as gradually wind down the asic mining I suppose).. what are the chances they'd agree to shoot themselves in the foot?

I don't think this is something to worry about.. but yea the internet is pretty insecure, and it's possible to divert traffic on it with minimal investment. 
Bitcoin nodes are highly concentrated in networks belonging to hosting companies like AWS.. if you divert traffic to some of those prefixes, it's possible that someone connecting to 8 random nodes/IP addresses are actually all connected to the attacker. This would allow the attacker to potentially double spend against the victim, by withholding all legitimate blocks and mining their own (with much less hash power) that shows the victim being paid.
In practice any attempt to hijack an AWS network is going to be noticed pretty rapidly and you can expect your rogue ISP to be cut off from the internet very quickly. There are probably a lot of better ways to steal BTC using bgp hijacks anyway.. simple things such as stealing email password resets would probably be more effective than attempting to split the p2p network.
Other things to consider might be the great Chinese firewall.. imagine you select 8 nodes all in China.. then 100% of your traffic could be diverted by the chinese to a fake node that pretends to pay you. Same if you were a chinese node that selected 8 foreign peers. There are actually a lot of small (and not so small) countries with very few routes out, creating chokepoints where a single attacker (say national telco) might be able to intercept all their communication. These kinds of situations might be more at risk from a bgp attack too as maybe someone could become an small hosting company attached to the national telco and then hijack all the traffic to aws just for the national telco customers.. I dunno.. I guess there are actually probably a lot of special edge cases where an attack like this could leverage BGP and possibly not be detected for a while.

USDT is a problem for USDT owners, not bitcoin owners. If you have coins on bitfinex that might be a problem, but if it turns out that bitfinex is empty would the price go down? Why? It did with mtgox, but there are lots of other exchanges now.. I don't think anyone will believe at this point that it's the end of bitcoin just because one more exchange collapses.. all it means is lots of people who thought they had BTC now don't and might want to re-buy whatever they can still afford elsewhere.

You just withdraw from the bitcoin exchange to your revolut IBAN account.. for coinbase you will still need to verify it first though.. which would be the same procedure that you can't make work with your GBP account.

The best way to buy bitcoin in the UK is to convert GBP to EUR and send it to an EUR exchange.. which could be coinbase. There really aren't any GBP exchanges worth mentioning.. there are various p2p methods like localbitcoins.com which work great but they're expensive.
Coinbase for example only takes GBP by credit/debit card, so that's a 4% fee right there.. along with stupidly low limits.. it would cost less than 4% to do a SWIFT wire from your UK account direct to your US account.
Use transferwise or maybe open a revolut.com account and use that to send yourself the money to your US bank account. Then deposit to coinbase as normal.

It's just called a sale. It's how business is operated.. they pay tax on their profits only. If you don't profit, then no tax is due.. but it does mean you need to keep good records as in the event that the irs decides to audit you, you'll want to be able to prove that you passed all the proceeds from the sale along to the guy who was actually selling. 
You probably also might want to consider that maybe the guy asking you to sell isn't planning to pay taxes and may be relying on you to firewall him from the irs (wouldn't be surprised if the passport story is bs).. you should not do that and you should make it clear to him that if the irs ever asks you about it you're going to tell them the details of the transaction.. that's mainly for his benefit so he doesn't get a nasty surprise later.

There is no way to withdraw GBP from coinbase. If you have GBP you will need to rebuy BTC and then sell it for EUR again.
Use a revolut.com EUR account to withdraw EUR. They also convert to GBP at a good fx rate. You can withdraw EUR to your GBP account (without using revolut), but it will probably cost you 2.5%.
You could also look at coinfloor.co.uk who do have a GBP orderbook and actually process GBP withdrawals, but from a bank in poland.. so you dont have fx issues, but its not great either.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:44:58
We'll just have to wait and see if LN fixes anything.. if not honestly cryptocurrency is never going to work in the way we had imagined. All coins will run into the same issues once enough people start trying to use them.

No reason you can't use real gold. One coin passed back and forth is all you need.

They have somewhere between 50 and maybe 200 staff and 1 million customers. They probably aren't going to hire more support staff.. the solution is going to be things like better FAQs and idiot proofing their products.. it's like with gmail - they don't provide customer service at all, but most people can figure it out on their own. Unfortunately that probably means a significantly lower standard of service than most people are used too from traditional banking institutions.. especially in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:47:55
SEPA is for euro payments only. Most brits use "faster payments" (the name of the system) to transfer GBP within the UK. Unfortunately faster payments bans anyone from dealing in bitcoin related transactions, so the normal bank transfer methods cannot be used to deal with cryptocurrency. It is possible to send GBP by SWIFT, however that incurs charges similar to SEPA transfers.
The SEPA rules don't actually require SEPA payments to be free, they just need to not cost more than other ways of sending EUR (which there aren't any - well other than SWIFT I suppose.).
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:31:16
There is probably nowhere you can buy £5000 using a debit card.. at least not in one go.
I would recommend not trying.. instead open a revolut.com account and using that, convert the funds to EUR and SEPA transfer them to an exchange. Bitstamp.net, kraken.com and coinbase.com all support EUR by SEPA bank trasfer.

each block is allowed to make one transaction that has no inputs and one or more outputs (a "coinbase" transaction) of up to the current block reward (which started at 50 btc and is halved every 210000 blocks - currently 12.5 btc)  + the difference between the inputs and outputs of every transaction (the difference is a fee paid to the miners by each transaction sender by not outputting all the money they input). 
So the block reward is not paid from anywhere in particular.. it's allowed because of the rules which dictate that for each block some number of btc can be paid from nowhere. The transaction fees come from the difference between inputs and outputs of everyone's transactions.

It doesn't matter how many full nodes you spin up, they will all be ignored by all the existing full nodes. Having said that, sybil attacks do work against light clients which a lot of people use (this would have been an issue if the S2X fork had gone ahead). For full nodes all you can really do is try and convince everyone who used to use the old system to join your new system.. that's pretty much what bitcoin cash is trying to do for example. It's a political attack, not a technical one.

I guess you might be right.. but I think it's more likely that most of the complaints stem from capacity issues.. it's the same thing with every bitcoin exchange having tons of negative reviews.. mostly they aren't scams.. they just aren't very good at dealing with their customers and then their customers freak out and scream fraud on the message boards.

Well.. not really.. bitcoin transactions are generally considered infeasible to reverse after 6 confirmations.. in practice there is no limit.. if all miners dedicated themselves to the task they could reverse everything right back to the genesis block and take back everyone's money.. that probably won't happen though.. with say a 4M transaction fee it provides a lot of incentive for miners to try and roll back a few blocks though, so probably 6 wouldn't be enough to be able to say it's gone.. how many would be.. I'm not sure.

In bitcoin transactions there are inputs and outputs.. the inputs are a reference to a previous output and also have to contain the redeem script which contains the pubkey. The outputs can contain pubkeys, but typically don't.. the most common is still a P2PKH which is basically the address.
As to your question though.. I'm not sure why you're confused.. the pubkeys can always be converted into addresses (that's the direction that works). It then indexes all those addresses in a database so they can easily be looked up without re-doing all that processing (perhaps this is what you were wondering about?)

Once it's implemented between all the major exchanges that'll pretty much get rid of all inter-exchange transfers.

There's nothing illegal about you trading on US exchanges.. the thing to remember though is that you are probably Australian resident.. and it might be fraud to pretend to be a US resident. 
There aren't many other US exchanges and other than gemini and coinbase I'm not sure what US exchanges you'd really want to use.
Gemini does not accept Australian residents and I also wouldn't be surprised if it's difficult or impossible to link a US bank account to an Australian coinbase account.
There would be no problem at all with you opening a bitstamp.net account as an Australian and funding it by wire transfer from your US bank account.. of course this costs more than ACH on coinbase which I imagine is what you had in mind. I suspect bitfinex could also be used like that. Possibly itbit.com which (unlike those two) is a US based exchange and might also work.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:54:31
well actually this is probably what they should do.. it's no different if they just abstain from including transactions rather than spamming their own though.. 
miners should try and extract the maximum tx fee possible.. the counterbalance is that anyone can start mining to mine their own transactions if it gets too expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:52:57
miners can destroy btc by not claiming the reward or some/all of the fees. You could make a transaction that pays 4M btc in fees and then not collect it in the coinbase and it will be gone.. of course other miners might try to rewind the block history to get it :p

I think the only exchange that requires a deposit first is coinbase.. probably either bitstamp.net or kraken.com would work fine.. however as says, what's the big deal about first depositing? Just send some trivial amount. You don't need to send from an EUR or USD account, it'll get converted.

I would argue that at the split the BCH tokens had 0 value, so no income tax payable. The first time they traded that would be a capital gain from 0.. unrealised until you sell it.

You need to enable your EUR IBAN account (not enabled by default). Without an IBAN the source of funds appears to be 'The currency cloud' rather than you and would be/was rejected by bitcoin exchaneges as a 3rd party transfer.. because lots of people were trying this (creating massive support problems on both ends), revolut banned 3rd party transfers (ie, without enabling the IBAN) to bitcoin exchanges. The error message you get doesn't really explain this at all though, so many people thought it was banned.. but all that's needed is to enable the IBAN and then it will work.

No, there's basically no way to do that.. signing up to an exchange will take days for verification.

RBF was implemented in an opt-in way and most wallets don't send RBF transactions still.. but I guess once they do start to send them by default, then 0 conf will be dead since merchants will hardly ever get any transactions that can't be bumped right in the wallet interface.
You're right that 0 conf was never secure anyway, and it isn't any more or less secure now (for those sending non-RBF'able transactions). 
Although it wasn't secure, for some set of customers (ie, in person coffee buyers) it managed to tread a fine line where it was difficult enough that they mostly didn't exploit it.. and probably those that would weren't part of that customer set to any great degree.
If you're going to have a fee market, it is necessary to have a transacation backlog, and it's also necessary to increase your fee bid when you bid too low. If 0 conf exists, it's very difficult to increase your bid and you'll probably have to wait a week or two before you can try a higher fee.
If bch is wedded to 0 conf, it means that they will never be able to rely on fee to pay for mining.. which also implies they will never be able to get rid of the block reward and will have to ramp up inflation in order to pay miners at some point.

If there is always space in the blocks then there is no backlog and no fee pressure - why would anyone pay a fee? And if there is and they do, their transactions will get stuck if they don't pay a large enough one because of 0 conf. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:21:38
So the plan is to have a set fee and always expand the blocks to accommodate that? I guess that might work, but it sure sounds like a recipe for monster blocks.

The payment channel is still Alice's money until she spends it. Even after she spends it, it'd be impossible to move that to another channel without an onchain transaction. What might be interesting is cooperatively batching channel closes from multiple parties into a single transaction, and also using some of the outputs to open new channels again. Not sure if it's possible.

afaik bitcoin exchanges were banned by the Beijing and Shanghai (office of financial services) municipal governments.. not by any national part of China.. so theoretically it might be still legal to run a bitcoin exchange elsewhere in China like shenzen.. although perhaps they would stomp it out there too if someone tries.. I guess my only point is that at some point these municipal shutdowns will probably be overturned and technically bitcoin will still never have been banned in china.

The point about global state being updated by each payment is not exactly how it works.. the state doesn't have to be 100% accurate in the same way that payments do. It is not important for every client to have accurate global state about channel paths and funding.
If a client attempts to send a payment via a node that previously advertised a (now outdated) path, the node can simply refuse the payment and the client can try a different path.. as long as nodes are cooperating, this kind of failure will fail fast and not really impact overall transaction speed.

There is not 1 single cash advance mcc code.. there are many different ones.. and many of those may or may not be considered cash advances by different card providers.. most "cash" type services have an mcc beginning with a 6, but not all.. maybe they were using one that wasn't generally considered a cash advance, but the banks have decided to start treating it as one (I believe some banks always did anyway - as people have been complaining about cash advance fees sporadically for a long time).
another possibility is that coinbase were forced (via threat to have their card processing pulled) to change to an mcc that is more widely considered to be a cash advance.

IMO it's already happening with accounts provided by non-bank payment service providers and e-money issuers. As banking becomes less profitable, banks will be forced to add more and more fees to basic bank accounts, which will increasingly drive people to close their bank accounts and use the less costly non-bank account providers.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:45:39
get a revolut.com account and maybe also a fire.com account. These both give you an EUR bank account with free SEPA transfers and easy/cheap conversion from GBP to EUR and back.
Then open accounts with coinbase/gdax and kraken.com and maybe also bitstamp.net. All can be used by EUR SEPA transfer from the previously opened bank accounts. Don't bother trying to use a debit/credit card as the fees are bad. There are no exchanges with native GBP banking access.  EUR SEPA is the way to go.

segwit was only ever going to solve anything by enabling LN.. the story never changed.. maybe some people didn't understand the story, but that's their fault imo.
edit: 
Other points LN uses src routing unlike the internet.. so the sender is always in control of the entire path (unlike with internet routing).. probably some reputation system will develop where the transaction originator would only pick trustworthy nodes.. certainly they could blacklist anyone who fails to perform for future transactions.. but that might not work too well if they can just create a new node identity.. in any case the worst that can happen is a denial of service as funds are delayed until they can be rerouted.
The legal liability thing is probably false IMO.. given that there's very little difference between onchain and offchain bitcoin transactions I don't see why regulators would try to draw a distinction.. in any case channels are not custody and nodes are not custodians.. so I think this point is invalid although I concede this is not yet proven.
On the online requirements.. these can mostly be handled by an agent that doesn't need to have real time access to the private key.. just stores pre-prepared transactions to be broadcast in certain circumstances.  Merchants are already out of business if their credit card gateway goes down.. if anything I think the offline wallet issue is far more of an annoyance to end users.. but it can be solved with agents.. I don't even see why it would be an issue for a merchant at all.
I don't really get the IRC analogy.. not well developed imo.. and hey IRC still works fairly well even though it has no security.
Additional minor problem regarding setting up channels.. if we get something like lightningramp.com up and going that is also a non-issue.
LN is the only scaling solution so it is by definition the simplest. Things like central banks are also good for scaling, but irrelevant in the context of scaling a blockchain.. and increasing the block size doesn't scale things anywhere near enough to count as a 'solution'.

They actually could do that fairly easily. When Polish nationals buy btc on an exchange it would be recorded somewhere, perhaps another chain, or even just a centralized db.. then that bitcoin transaction could be traced using that first in first out accounting method and if you try to spend btc at a polish shop either your funding source is shown as tax paid, or else the shop charges you an extra 1%.

That isn't really how taxes work. If you just sell the BTC and withdraw to your bank account, 99% of the time nothing is gonna happen. It's just when you get audited and need to provide documentation for all the stuff you bought that it matters. It's just fear of that 1% of the time that keeps everyone in line paying taxes. The tax authority has the authority to get VCC or bitcoin debit card provider records just as much as a bank's.

It's probably just about possible to do 15 million tx/day on a broadcast blockchain.. it will end up being somewhat centralised.. but with nodes in a few different jurisdictions it might be ok. It's probably still on the upper end of what avid blockchain enthusiasts could run at home with a fast internet connection and a few 10TB HDs.
I imagine that there are a lot more online visa transactions now than there were in 2009 though, and what about all the offline transactions?

It would be pretty easy to impose it on all EU exchanges I expect.. which would get them the 1% in and out of crypto.. maybe not on crypto only trading, but still this is an interesting development.. the first country in the world to charge sales tax / vat on crypto. The special 1% rate is also interesting.. it probably won't act as a major disincentive to buying/selling crypto as it's still less than CC fees that people are paying.. but it could actually raise a significant amount of money for the govt.
If it goes well, the US might well do something similar once trump abolishes the online sales tax exemption.
edit again: Thinking about this some more, probably for crypto only trades or crypto vs. goods, you would be able to offset the vat owed on the goods vs that owed on the crypto. I wonder how this works if you are a Polish resident importing vat exempt goods.. perhaps you could claim the 1% back from the government.
