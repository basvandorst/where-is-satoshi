Just bought a dozen Sriracha Bacon for stocking stuffers. This is so fucking cool.

I'm probably not making money with my block eruptors and Klondike, but it's fun to watch cgminer and the blinking lights.

I'm not sure what part of "Application Specific" in ASIC doesn't make sense. The majority of the Bitcoin mining power is ASICs that are designed to do only the double SHA-256 hash for Bitcoin mining. If this were 2012 or we were still using FPGAs then I would totally agree with you.

Bitcoin is already in Cleveland, I am running a full node from my dorm room :)

Slush is probably not going to comment on that, but as with everything in Bitcoin, early adoption seems to pay off. That said, with the rapid rise in value I think we can expect a significant portion cut off the price.

Shit, I would love to, but could never get my damn account to L2 verified to do it in the first place! Not very happy and Olaf was less than helpful.

Yeah, they're using a log scale graph, so the 500 is very close to the 1000.

That's pointless with a bank fee of $0.15 and a 1% Coinbase fee.

Okay, but in all fairness, they tell you NOT TO LOCK your luggage unless you have a lock that can be opened by them. From the TSA:

You can't do it on the app but if you log into the website using your creds and buy a card with coins it will show up in your mobile card wallet.

.15 from mining in the last month... power went out at my house last night and I have to wait until I go home for Thanksgiving to restart my machine...

That's quite the farm you've got going!

I'm not even one of their customers and I'm super excited. They seem like really stand-up, hardworking guys with a great product. Here's to not-yet-broken promises (not another Avalon, BFL, bASIC, etc.)!

Same could be said for disgruntled janitors at NASA or the Pentagon. Rule 1: Don't check valuables; carry on or ship to destination. Lesson 2: Never trust the TSA/strangers with your shit. That being said, never locked a bag and never had anything stolen. My bag did get pulled and inspected on my domestic flight to Hawaii, though. They leave you a nice little pamphlet with zero useful information on it.

This is easily worked around by using addresses correctly. Say you use one address for each purpose (As you should be doing). You have 10 addresses, but no one else knows that you own all of them. 
This is one of the side-effects of Bitcoin being decentralized. Trust no one, so address balances and transactions are all public. It's one of the major points that Satoshi outlines in the white paper, and really one of the major reasons that Bitcoin is appealing at all.
