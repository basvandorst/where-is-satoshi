@_date: 2019-07-17 05:00:40

I see the advantage of a hardware wallet, 24 words somehow being able to generate that key seems fishy to me but I guess it works. Just seems to me like for long term storage a paper wallet would be better, my plan is to put my bitcoin on the paper wallet and only add to it. Someday when its used and cashed out you would do it all at once and if you wanted to add more to the paper wallet you would make a whole new one. The whole getting your 24 word key stolen/lost seems the same to me as a paper wallet key but one step is removed (the hardware piece). I know the paper wallet is done on a computer so technically there is risk there, But not if done right.

Seems like something unnessecary to spend money on or geek out on. Looks like Ill be going with the paper wallet unless anyone can convince me otherwise. I dont mind keeping a little bit on an exchange to “spend” or whatever so if I lose my $60 or whatever ohh well but Ill keep the bulk on the paper wallet and HODL

So as long as you have the 24 word seed there really is no reason to have a second device correct? I dont see the benefit.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:50:38
Still better than nothing, how would I go ab this?

Got a strange text from an Icloud account, they knew my hometown I havent lived in for years so I was curious on any info I could get on it. It obviously someone I know or knew.

If I can find out what city its from I could narrow it down to who it may be drastically.

Get away from coinbase whatever you do. I am in the process myself.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:21:55
It also seems like you are just creating another failure point. Instead of using a paper wallet and risning losing the private key, you are now risking losing a 24 word key, which links to the private key, which links to the address. This really seems like they are just selling a device that gives you a paper wallet lol Im not seeing the advantage here unless you plan on add/removing your crypto often. But for long term storage you would just add too how would a paper wallet not be better?

So can bitcoin exceed 4.5 tps and is it scaleable? or not?
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:45:45
Coinbase is absolute trash and I refuse to even download it again. Cash app is the way to go.

Why is everyone posting when they see a bitcoin ATM? Has anyone ever actually looked at one? I was so excited when I first saw one only to realize it sells bitcoin for 75% above market and buys it at 75% below market price. Complete rip off and scam and only hurts adoption if you ask me.
