similar method is through bitfloor, instead of cvs it's at Bank of America.
just added $500 in today and it was in my bit wallet in under 5 minutes!

if you read the op's comment, you would know why you are incorrect.
his transaction was deemed INVALID.  and YET he still received no money.

* sometimes people don't read the entire comment and just run in assuming a bunch of hoopla.
* i've had this happen with coinbase before.  I really detest using them anymore.
they never have coins.  are terrible with returns.  slow with replies.  the list goes on!

I am a beginner. 
I've been reading about bitcoins since they were $1.  But, bought in at $130.
What I have learned so far is that it is still very speculative.
There are some groups that are in for the long run, holding their coins for the next decade at least.
Day trading is not so sustainable on bitcoins, but, easier with litecoins and much easier with ppcoins.
Litecoins were a dollar a few days ago, now they are $4.  I feel that this sudden rise is due to mt.gox news of soon accepting ltc.
There are a lot of trolls out there.  Be VERY careful with who you listen to.
Don't leave all your coins in one place, make sure to back them up.  I use blockchain to store my coins and create a paper wallet.
Don't feel bad if it fluctuates during a day, it will drive you insane.
Don't day trade bitcoins for now, if ever.
Bitfloor is super easy to transfer $ to BTC.
Bitstamp is also very good.
Mtgox has huge lines and a lot of lag lately.
One again, try not to watch the charts too closely, it will drive you nuts.
Good luck!

Got it, thanks!
I don't understand why the price cannot raise though, is it because the $399,000 of bitcoins needs to purchased up first? That is, if the bot does not take it down.

Sorry if I sound uneducated, but I am fairly new to both stocks and bitcoins.
What is a "wall" exactly?

ASIC dominance over the btc market will move the gpu miners to the next best thing - ltc.
also, mt.gox is in the motions to allow ltc trading.

best bet would be to continue what you are doing now.
spread the word throughout the entire online bitcoin community until they pay attention.
good luck!

it's clear that once gox opens up there will be a huge sell of, it is up to you if you want to sell now to double up, or just to hold off for the long run.  it's all my personal opinion and nothing more..

buy litecoin now.

You can't get both speed and low interest.
You either by cheap and wait patiently, or spend the extra for tonight.
