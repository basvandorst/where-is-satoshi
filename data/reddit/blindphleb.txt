So essentially the argument is that bitcoin is still too new to market to be accurately valued? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:02:47
Could you explain? It seems intuitive that a currency should be at least more stable than bitcoin.

I'm amazed it didn't occur to someone making a currency for the future that building an exchange into the platform would be a good idea. It should have been a priority after Mt.Gox honestly.

Exactly, I'm tired of hearing excuses like "exchanges are under some extreme loads right now", their whole job is to handle loads like these.

The future of money huh?

I don't see any way people would flock to Bitcoin in a typical recession. If anything it would be sold off to cover cost from loss of employment. It's currently being used as an investment and people in financial trouble don't invest. Imagine those threads we get in here every so often where someone has tons of debt and is asking us all if it is wise to buy Bitcoin even if he can't make ends meet. We always say no. Well now imagine that every-so-often-poster is a sizable portion of the work force. Only people that will be buying are those who are financially insulated.

I swear one day I’ll be able to buy a ship with all these tulips I’ve been stacking. I don’t actually plant them, but one day someone will definitely want to plant them. Then who they going to come to? Me! That’s who.

I saw a post claiming a large sell wall at $6200. Can’t find it now though.

I always wondered what I sounded like right after reading Atlas Shrugged in high school. God, people were right; I was insufferable. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:19:52
Wow this looks cool. Thanks for sharing.

Yes, I understand that exchanges are not the blockchain. But they are crucial to bitcoin's success. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:38:48
Which exchange do you work for? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:59:15
Thanks for the tips! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:45:01
That’s a pretty weak definition of decentralized.

Perfect, the project that has its genesis in a distrust of 3rd party financial institutions is still at the mercy of 3rd party financial institutions.

So about that fast part. How do you get around most popular exchanges shitting the bed constantly?
