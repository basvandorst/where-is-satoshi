Yea people should be thrilled every time a whale dumps, it’s called wealth distribution... imagine if the richest in society were constantly getting rid of their wealth for goods, would people be angry at that? Or see it as an opportunity to claim some?

Hey make room for a 2013 boi
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:48:45
I agree Except in the context of someone saying “how many bitcoins do you own”, meh, interchangeable in that sense.
“Send me 5 bitcoins”
I want 21 coins. As opposed to 21 coin... 
So whatevs, both ways are fine really
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:54:38

They indirectly do though, the miners claim the daily block reward which currently is 1800 coins, and so as that is the new issuance of the currency, they choose at what value they will sell at
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:44:24
That site doesn’t work for me.. at all, returns an empty result no matter what I search, even searching 1 BTC for all time...
@_date: 2019-06-03 02:22:26
It could, but it’s astronomically high... as in, take every atom in the known universe and pick the right one kind of high...
Edit: did some research, it’s about a 1 in 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 chance, good luck tho!
If you had a computer set up to constantly create new wallets in hope for a collision and we’re generating them at 10 seconds a pop, it would only take about 7,723,985,483,949,047,216,956,731,104,749,508,602,105 years.
I believe in you.
Or put it another way, if you ran it for say 100 years, you would have approximately about .00000000000000001% chance
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:05:07
I’m not trying to move a wallet I just want to keep my portfolio in my app of choice, but can’t add arbitrary units so I’d like to just add a public address with the equivalent value 
I had it before for a year but then they guy moved the coins lol, so now I need a new one... I’d tip if someone could find me a current value of 11.4 or close to it that hasn’t moved in a while...
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:22:29
No he’s saying, I think it’s smart to accept many and put it into major coins myself.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:03:54
It doesn’t work like that, until miners wake up to realize that the mining reward has decreased and they need a raise in the value of the token to remain profitable it won’t change. That happens when it happens, not before.
It’s akin to saying, well everyone knows that it’s gonna rain Monday, so since everyone knows they should start using umbrellas leading up the Monday.
But that’s silly, you only need an umbrella WHEN it’s raining, not before.
Similarly, you only need to have bitcoins value increase when you are not as profitable and 50% issuance SCARCITY IS IN EFFECT.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:56:10
Technically 0. In the sense that they are already made, just not issued. If you want to earn one, well then you have to put forth viable work, how much that costs you is dependant on your local electricity usage to do the work.
If you were utilizing solar for example, it would be 0 I suppose.
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:54:33
Yea it’s retarded. Bitcoin is not a digital currency like wtf you smokin

I’m bad at math what is it if u have 21 coins? 42? 63? 100? 150? 200?

It has happened to other chains, it’s not something we don’t know about we have full understanding of what occurs. 
You can’t just 51% the chain, I think Andreas once stated it’s something like 4 billion dollars to hijack the chain and only for ten minutes, each block requires another 4billion so might as well just buy the asset.
Edit: these may have been values from 2013 - not sure - it’s in his Jefferson dinner video from that era
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:53:40
If some super rich elite today decided to buy 6% of all coins would you try to fork him out?
@_date: 2019-04-21 17:50:15
I see, well I already pay 15 bucks a month just to have an account so I guess it’s already like that.

Just google it mannnnn
“Based on the current number of computations produced by the computers solving the Bitcoin algorithm, a.k.a. the network hash rate, it would cost approximately $1.4 billion to conduct a fifty-one percent attack.
Such an attack would require 2.4 million of the most advanced ASIC computers currently available. To house these units it would require approximately $250 million in infrastructure, including buildings, ventilation, and other construction costs.
This many ASICs would consume roughly 29.3 Terawatts of electricity annually, roughly the same amount of electricity that is consumed by the entire country of Morocco.
At a standard electricity rate of $0.12 per kWh, mining one Bitcoin costs $6100.
To run all of these ASICs would cost over $2 million per day in electricity alone. Labor and other miscellaneous costs would add another $240 thousand to this daily figure. Note, these figures do not include potential costs that could be recouped by selling Bitcoin back into the market during the chaos. It is possible that an attacker could recoup 20-100 percent of the costs depending on the health of the Bitcoin market at the time of the sale, potentially reducing the cost of attack.”

@_date: 2019-04-23 19:03:00
If it were easy many of the smaller coins would have been 51%’d by now.
Truth is it is extremely cost innefective, even for smaller chains, bitcoin on the other hand it is almost impossible save from some black swan events
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:51:58
The market would say this is theft, he created the system, and deserves his spoils for securing it in the early days.
You’re a tool for suggesting this.

Maybe I’m confused but aren’t negative interest rates good? 
Like I have a loan and I pay 3.5% but I’d rather pay -3.5% in other words they are paying me to take out the loan? Or am I confused?

Not sure but I would advise not using Armory as it has been discontinued and has no support
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:02:22
Yes but whatever you cash out becomes income so then you have to pay the marginal rate.
Ie. if you are unemployed and made 0, you might say oh I will pay no gains.
So you cash out 250k, well now you’re in the top bracket and pay the most gains.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:25:37
Yea well bitcoin also rose 20 grand in 45 days and who got gifted? The retail investors, so it must be a great system! 
See - it works both ways, and now I’ve attacked your argument not you.
Lots of people bought the top of Apple stocks, or Netflix, or any other stock, so they must all be scams. What a scammy world we live in.
Omg. This guy is into waltonchain...

@_date: 2019-05-06 05:29:27
You know, technically if the user decides not to sell then they haven’t lost their money. They can hold a little longer until things stabilize at a higher price point and then decide to exit the market.
Pretty much if you bought at any time in the last ten years other than in December you would be net positive. So I’m sorry you lost some cash, but generally speaking we as a community are glad to leave you behind in your air clawing rage as we move forward with the future of modern finance.
