Coinbase is working for me.

Me too!

There is hope yet! With Whole Foods now accepting it, perhaps Amazon is considering accepting btc on a broader scale.

For just the machine, you’re right, but an ATM transaction also requires energy from servers and from other consumption related to the bank branch. PRI and Wired both use the 650 figure, which I admit I recall from memory, so I’m citing those two after looking for the figure (which tbf is datamining). 
Let’s say I’m wrong, as I often am, and from here out we’ll use your numbers. Do you conclude that btc uses an unacceptable amount of energy?

Weak economic data out today, especially in the retail sector. The S&amp;P just openned down about 0.5%. It should be an intersting day to observe for btc after Monday’s rally and relatively flat prices yesterday. To me, it seems important to track btc relative to the S&amp;P whenever some kind of event happens or new data comes out socthat we can observe any patterns in what the market views as what drives btc’s value.

They’re wrong about the “using up a huge amount of energy” one and the “pain in the ass to set up” one. Compare the energy usage to ATMs for example, or compare the difficulty of setting up a wallet with setting up a brokerage account.

That’s the theory anyways, and luckily gold has some nuances that we can examine to see just how well that theory plays out. Certain kinds of weakness in the market play out better for gold than others. Specifically, anything that has to do with the current financial system in general seems to help gold more than something like a bad day for consumer tech. Part of the problem today is that on one hand we have bad news in retail, and gold is already doing well today because of that, but on the other hand we have some noise from Binance re-openning. So if btc does poorly today, you can take action based on whether you think that’s because of a onetime issue from Binance or because the theory is bullshit. If btc does well today, well, that’s just one more day where the theory seems to have panned out well.

With other currencies, that’s mitigated through the futures market. That’s another thing we’re missing for now.

It would appear you’re right if we’re both just talking about ATMs alone vs btc. 
I said ATMs alone, which according to the Federal Reserve go through about 6 billion transactions a year worldwide. Transaction volume for btc yesterday was about 390k, but it’s averaged to about 300k per day over the last year. So let’s say 300k * 365 = 109,500,000transactions per year. 35/109,500,000 = 3.2e-7 terrawatts per transaction. 650/6,000,000,000=1.08e-7 per transaction. 
So looking at my back of the napkin math, A btc transaction takes about 3x the energy required for a typical atm transaction. So if all ATM transactions were done with btc instead, that would come out to around 2,000 terrawatt hours. That is stil less than the consumption of the entire global banking system but, I concede the point, is more per transaction than an ATM if we’re just counting the actual ATM transaction and not the energy cost of servicing it, running software updates, keeping the machine on, etc.
Edit: for fun, I’d like to point out that if btc accounted for about 3% of worldwide transaction volume, and not 100% like I mentioned, we could expect to trade at over $100k per coin assuming the value of the USD remains static (which it won’t). 100% would be $3.3 million per btc if you calculate by just multiplying, or if you say, ok, there is about $80 trillion in M2 in the wntire world and 21 million btc, that’s about $3.8 million per coin. Obviously these are just theoretical upper bounds, but hey, if we all get that rich, it will be fun as long as we don’t actually destroy the world...

I bought in at $3.5k myself earlier this year, and I agree with you. Looking back on these last few months, I think it’s important to differentiate between a onetime event like a specific group of people selling for reasons that have to do with Binance and not directly to do with btc and the events which caused the growth we have seen this year. These fits and starts of growth and decline are a natural part of an early stage of adoption, and are to be expected. People selling off and artificially lowering the price out of frustration with a single institution is capricious, and all else being equal, provides a clear opportunity to profit from that caprice.

Turbotax made it easy for me when I filed earlier this year
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:29:30
76% btc, 10% eth, and 15% split between several other coins.
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:51:25
Luckily, many were in coinbase, so it was easy to see how much I bought and when for those at least. In fact, Turbotax does that part on its own because it integrates with Coinbase like it does for Fidelity or ETrade. For the rest, I just had to look at when I transacted, and I did my best to match the prices, using any accounts I could to sort of double check.

Due to increasing the usage of cryptocurrencies in general? Is it any concern that FB’s coin would compete with Bitcoin or is that too simplistic of an outlook given that these are both currencies, not products?
@_date: 2019-05-03 00:02:49
I see, so given that crypto is still an emerging asset class and we’re still pretty far to the left on the adoption curve, we should welcome new entrants because the development of the market in general is a good thing for the moment. Then laters, the dominant players like BTC will eleminate the shitcoins as the market matures.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:29:29
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:25:28
ATMs comsume about 20x more than bitcoin mining in aggregate, but the per transaction energy cost of bitcoin is about 3x that of an ATM transaction. However, this doesn’t account for externalities that ATMs cause, which result in additional energy consumption. If all transactions in the world that are currently conducted in fiat were made with btc instead, the energy requirement would still be less than the global banking system uses today, although it would be more than the ATMs alone consume.
Also there are 8.4 million people in Switzerland, which is about 100k fewer people than the state of Virginia.

I love this kind of analysis. I’ve done some research on finding a beta for btc in the past, so I thought I’d share my thoughts. 
Generally, I agree with you. Btc has generally not been correlated with the market, although I caution the use of beta for btc because its metioric rise in price overall dwarves the cyclicality you’re trying to measure when you look for beta generally. Beta for btc is even crazier than 0, it’s more like n/m. Still, in most cases, once you control for the adoption curve, I imagine you’d be totally right. I would like to add a small detail, which I’m sure you’re aware of, but could be useful to people who want to compare btc with gold. Estimating future beta can be difficult because beta itself is not static and can change depending on what part of the cycle you’re in. So gold, for example, has a beta much closer to -1 when the S&amp;P is falling rapidly, but gold’s beta can even be above 0 when the market is doing a little better as it did during 2017 when gold’s 3 year monthly beta was closer to 1 than 0. Therefore, whether you’re going for a non-correlated asset or an asset that just goes sort of the opposite way of the S&amp;P changes depending on your timeframe, and knowing what you’ll end up with requires you to time the cycle to some extent. 
Meanwhile, if the digital gold thesis is correct, we should see the beta of btc converge with that of gold to some extent, but that doesn’t mean they’ll both be less than zero all the time for the reasons I just stated. Once that happens, it will be a sign that bitcoin has matured though, so we have it good right now while btc’s beta is either 0 or n/m depending on how you view it.

This guy began publishing about crypto in 2017, at which point his company also changed its name to reflect a focus on crypto. He’s written a book on trading crypto (also in 2017), and he has written a few columns for a few major British publications, generally about crypto, which have earned him a few awards according to wikipedia. Those seem to be his qualifications, though I’m not going to defend calling him an expert.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:50:22
I didn’t consider that it would scale exponentially. I stand corrected. Do you suppose ATMs account for more than 1/9 or less than 1/9 of all energy used by the banking industry?
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:38:06
So we can expect this to be a onetime event?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:23:07
Idk if you’re joking, but in case you aren’t, Yusko has been in for quite some time. If you check out his twitter, you can see he’s been a big advicate of crypto in general, but BTC in particular for several years. He even has an open $1mm bet out that a portfolio of cryptocurrencies his team has selected will outperform the S&amp;P over the next ten years.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:33:58
Bitcoin mining accounted for about 35 terrawatt hours of energy in 2017. ATMs accounted for 650. The concerns about btc’s enviornmental impact are sensationalist and overblown.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:43:33
For my (probably shitty) math, please see my other comments in this thread. For better sources, the Fed publishes ATM data if you want the gritty details I did not provide, and that’s obviously a better source than I am.
I do admit we need to do something longterm about energy consumption, but looking at what btc uses now, it seems to me we luckily have some wiggle room unless we think it will replace the entire fiat system (as you suggested) in the short term before renewable energy can catch up.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:13:13
I totally agree with that premise. We are still so early in the game, the real scale of harm may not be visible yet, for better or worse.
