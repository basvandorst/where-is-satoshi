This has nothing to do with the fact that it's a fiat currency! No money printing or fractional reserve banking is causing this. If the country would be running on a fixed supply crypto currency that was only used in there, the effect would be the same. It's purely caused by the new government policy. if the whole world would be running on 1 crypto and no exchange rate fluctuations would exist, this would demonstrate as a slower price drop on most things in South Africa.

I don't think that's what he's saying. If BTC would become the world currency, in that case holding 1 BTC would place you higher in the "ranking" then the lowest of the current millionaires. In reality you will be higher is the list, since only about 500K addresses hold more than 1 BTC.

and 640k ought to be enough for anybody...

How can a hack of multiple accounts via API / 2FA result in 1 withdrawl transaction? would this not create multiple transactions, 1 per account? sounds like the hacker got a hold of the hot wallet keys instead of user API's or 2FA no?
