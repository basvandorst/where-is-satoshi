lol, the tipic: "then they laugh at us..."
@_date: 2016-08-14 05:27:29
it means that every tokens should be identical, with bitcoin that doesnt happen becaus tokens come with the previous transactions, and in the worst case you can get your self with tokens comming from trafic or something worse and have to explain to the authorities how do you got them

I first thought that too, but I searched, the sentence that is around the internet is "first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win" 
Well, is known that bitcoin use to ignore monero a lot, if think monero is moving to the second stage :D

Privacy coins can't scale the same way as bitcoin can't scale... It's all blockchain technology, the privacy transactions are a little heavier and that makes them a more spensive, but they are as scalable as bitcoin, and second layer transactions are coming there too, but the base layer needs to be private

yes, I agree 100% with you.... and there is alse the case where people can get some serious desiese or born with one ann cant get treatment because its too expensive in a private health care system...

Yes, and you see what mess we are now with ipv4.... With ipv6 lagging to became the new standard..... I don't think bitcoin can became a currency before it became fungible.... Until now, for me, bitcoin is just a GOOD store of value... Don't get me wrong, but I believe this should be number one priority, or something will eventually overthrone bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-16 11:59:19
I don't agree... Bitcoin isn't private and that make not my first choice as cryptocurrency. if anyone ever try to push that the community will split again...

But if I want to communicate with my friends I still need Facebook, the same thing happens with coins.... 1btc or 1 whatever cost you x dollars, but if you want to spend it you need someone to accept it... If everyone accept whatever you dont need bitcoin anymore, just like, if my all my friends use discord I don't need Facebook anymore...

In my opinion bitcoin would be far from the only one, like some Russian president told, it's very likely to the government's try to create theyr own blockchain currencie and enforce them....

@_date: 2017-08-06 19:07:14
They found the coins of the mtgox on btce recently... There is a big chance that the guy of the alphabay was tracked with his bitcoins.. Even the people behind the the ransonware are exchanging theyir btc to monero with shapeshift to preventing being arrested, if bitcoins was really anonymous there was no need for that 
The coins of bitfinex are not on the move afaik, every time they are a topic on reddit pop-up with that information
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:28:59
I dont understund why you guys dont support 2Mbytes blocks, I dont see any issue with that, it helped BTC to get segwit, even I believe that the way is to bring scaling to offchain 2MBytes will eventualy be a need, dont see why not activating it right now and make the miners happy as well... no supporting it can bring BTC to another splitchain, I dont want a world where you have 10 btc splits, every each one with some small modifications because the comunity could get is shit together...

We don't know what gonna be the approach of the government's, they can create theyr own one sell it like an IPO and enforce it for daily use, it would still decentralized.... Just throwing rocks, we will know only when the first Government try to do it (probably Russia?) 
About other crypto currencies, o probably should research them, monero don't waste more resources than bitcoin, it was just think differently, about ethereum I don't full understand it either, but I understand what it can bring and I like the idea... It is POW at the moment and only after a period of time it becomes POS, but after all is an technology that probably will stay, and if you don't like POS you can just fork it and make your own EthereumPOWOnly
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:17:52

@_date: 2019-10-14 23:15:30
All transactions are linkable, even if you don't have your name on the blockchain it's not hard to analyze an transaction history and get some very good evidence that an group of transactions belong only to one user..
Yeah, it's only random letters in a database that don't have your name, but you exchange money with other people that can look to your transaction history and make some accurate guesses on what you have and how do you use your coins
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:02:01
That's pointless with the advanced data analysis that already is happening. That's the kind of thought that I am most afraid in the bitcoin community.... There are already good techniques that make analyze much harder (like Confidencial Transactions), if bitcoin don't go towards that it's doomed imo... I don't use bitcoin for nothing more than store of value and "safe heaven" for that reasons... And as the time passes the people will start realizing that bitcoin simply isn't enough in its current form 
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:18:21

KYC/AML would come sooner or later, we had fight things like sopa and pipa but governments allways keep pushing things like that, now we in EU will have something like that too....

No... If you use xmr only to "mix" bitcoins you will leave foot print for advanced analysis tools, for example 1 btc &gt; ¿? xmr -&gt; 0.99 BTC
An advance learning tool will deduce your transaction if you do it too close one to another, you need to keep the majority of your money in a private blockchain to remain anonymous, -for me- xmr with 2nd layer scaling makes more sense than bitcoin, I don't think bitcoin can ever be private as monero, I already saw a lot of bitcoin maximalists saying that bitcoin is and should remain transparent

This is the problem of the deflationary economy, you never want to spend your money because you belive it will worth more in the future. I have the same problem.... This will really change the world....

Edit: someone's did this already  xD

This..... The price of the pizza was the same as today.... If no one ever spend bitcoin there's no utility.. I use my bitcoins and I never regretted that, yes, looking back and see that shitty vps costing what is some thousands today can make me melancholic, but I don't regret it.... It Hurst a lot more looking for the price of the coffee less than 0.25 today 15 years ago and 0.65e today

I understand you.... But you will not spend the money like you spend dollars because dollars have inflation, and you don't have any incentive to hold it, even if you have it on the bank it give you what? 5% year? The inflacrions is more, you better use your money to invest in something that really can give you some return or you just spend it in something that you want/need and make the "economy" keep working.... But when btc will allways worth more (let's say) land on the year after what is your incentive to spend it? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:24:43
Well, one thing is for certain, btc price in dollars gonna to start raising faster than with other currencies 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:41:32
You shouldn't ask me, my opinion can be biased, so make your research...
But in one word: Fungibility
It's one thing that bitcoin don't have and every currency need to be to truly be a currency
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:55:02
Change btc core to community.. Makes more sense 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:18:02
You are comparing banks with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 10:56:13
Bitcoin is never down
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:33:56
Globee, it should be fast to implement, they use the same API as bitpay 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:15:00
If there's no community would be no bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:42:27
you know, some of us dont mind to make a small profit mining and secure our descentralised coins instead of let the chinese centralise our coin until we cant controll it anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:43:11
Yeah, that comenta are hilarious... I hope he just ignore, nothing new to be sayed...
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:59:08
And this is why I own more monero than bitcoin.... Don't take me wrong on this please, but I think we should take bitcoin forward on it privacy as soon as possible
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:16:14
I à the only one that become sad when I see a rich man joining bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:25:03
have you tryed to restore the deleted files ? I did that once and it worked ( you need to be luck to not overwrite the same disk space where your wallet was stored before)
@_date: 2016-10-01 09:53:20
Fungibility matters
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:01:39
talks alot about the limit in suply on all cryptocurrencies... This is false... this is an property of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies can have no suplylimit, ie dogecoin
appart of it, good infographic
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:30:01
actualy dash use masternodes, monero use ring signatures and seath addresss
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:24:19
Man, we all already acknowledged that he is a faker, please just stop making him the spot light, it's like you listen to somebody even more insignificant to crypto than yourself (or me)
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:01:06
what if it goes to 10000$ and then crash to 2000$ ? :O
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:48:50
This is why Fungibility matters, and I don't even am approving rasoms

I am buying games on STEAM with BTC months ago
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:10:10
Yes, but you can use that same laptop to mine for example monero that uses cryptonigh and mitigate the difference between cpu, gpu and in the future with asic, and get some real revenue.... 
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:34:04
Alphabay being out of the picture is not a that good IMO, I never used it, but if the owner was catch because bitcoin is not that private, it's a very bad thing 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:50:05
The majority of them will certainly give the coins for they rightful owner... As happened before with etc... I think Roger ver, bitmain and co will let the coin die at the beginning, and then pump it hard, FUD is coming 
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:48:31
Actually.. Shitcoins that just clone bitcoin and add (insert feature here) are counterfeit bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:21:15
Ahahah, like the idea.. Would be fun have someone commenting it like football 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:00:39
It's not a prediction, it's a consequence... 
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:17:52
Not only bitcoin but crypto in general  I am big fan of bitcoin and monero atm
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:31:03

@_date: 2017-06-11 13:05:06
Of course 95% of projects are crap and don't need to be decentralized or blockchain, but how would they got theyr 10 of millions in a ico if they don't use that words? You dummy
