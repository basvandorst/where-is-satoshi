How can I transfer my Coinbase funds (bitcoin) to something else? I’m sick of them...
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:13:03
Yes, yes, and yes. More than ever actually.

How did that cause your bitcoin to get stolen, I’m lost mate.
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:35:33
It’s basically like saying Voldemort in Harry Potter

Another irrelevant opinion from an irrelevant person. Boring.
@_date: 2019-04-16 08:14:13
No that’s fucking ridiculous. That goes against everything crypto even stands for, wtf.

Lambos for everyone 
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:45:37
One day people will be praying for it to go down to $384,400 to buy at a “good price”.
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:52:49

@_date: 2019-04-07 23:35:17
Ya good luck suing Facebook. Hilarious when people think they can sue large corporations over retarded things.

I took out a home loan to buy my bitcoin, if you have good credit I suggest you do the same
@_date: 2019-05-01 03:04:25
Probably on a foreclosure
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:16:23
Come back when the 44 day crosses the 762 day. Then we’re talking lambos and trips to Fiji.
