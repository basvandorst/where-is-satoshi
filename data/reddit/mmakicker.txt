Reply in these threads telling the issue
And also give a signed message from the address you sent the btc from to prove that you are the owner of the address that did the transaction.
Bitmixer does 65,000 btc transaction average per month, they should be able to give your btc back if you can prove to  them that it was you who sent the btc.
Edit: I saw that you had already signed the addresses  Now it is upto Bitmixer to take pity on you for your mistake and refund you or they take it to themselves, it is all upto them.

That person first received wallet contains [35 addreses]( try running 1 by 1 in google and see if they have any connections in bitcointalk or elsewhere where they openly posted about it. It is not very easy to recover when Bitcoin is stolen and out of your hands, be careful next time.

It is good to see mainstream sport stars promoting  Bitcoin. The guy has millions of followers and he can easily capitalize on them, and it will increase mainstream visibility and higher adoption of Bitcoin.

Here is an excerpt from an interview with Bitmixer owner 


---According to our profit, last month we’ve processed about 65,000 btc.
Taking 1% fees they charge, it comes to 650 btc gross profit, they have good reserves to do the transaction and after the staff salary Bitmixer will be left with a good sum mostly upwards of 300 btc to ~ 600 btc.
They also have a signature campain in bitcointalk where a user can earn ~ 0.14 btc a month and have about 400 users in the campaign which translates to 56 btc per month for signature campaign marketing.

Interesting app, we need more inventions as these.

I think Bitmixer owner makes about 600 btc + profit every month. It was very generous of him to give extra 5 btc almost a 20% extra. Good going Bitmixer.

Nothing is too big to fail.

[Even the mighty $7.4 Trillion Dutch east Indian company failed, i am optimist but at the same time realistic, people should think well and invest in Bitcoins what they can afford to lose](

You have transferred it to some other Bitcoin address which happened to have same public address that of litecoin, the bitcoin balance is in that btc address , that litecoin address does not have any balance

I know i can trust your company with my Bitcoins. Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:55:23
I see many exchanges losing to hackers etc, keep security one of your top priorities.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:22:08
I will trade Bitcoins in your exchange, thanks for making it happen :)
 go strong!

Give electrum wallet a try :)

[You can see here]( when sent with zero fees it may possibly never confirm. Mostly after few days it will fall off from the blockchain and the btc back in your wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:39:41
It is lightweight and fast.  It has an auto-connect feature which selects the servers in the longest blockchain which contributes to a faster confirmation time provided right transaction fee is set(usually the default fee).

Check if your system has any malware in it, heard of some malware which changes address when you paste the address to send in wallet to that of the malware owner.
You can use this software to clean up malware
I would recommend you to format your system if you tried above and still something happens as i described, and don't click any suspicious link or visit sites that contain many ads as they hide these codes in the site, which in turn installs the malware in your system automatically, when clicking on one of their ads.
You can use adblock to stop these ads.

That's a great step up, and address 16h9587CZLsyLGqH81QVJSkFwqyY1AuWRH is from the wallet 01585ccd842eeabd , 
and the wallet owner had transferred 0.25 btc to LBC on October 17th tx id a3261f05151299c45212ddb01a3c714f0690bd4cf2ad0911e49ba3fe7faa0dbd , you can ask LBC who did the deposit and they can possibly get you the LBC account owner name and it is a hassle, and all the best in you getting your btc back. Try to remember the transaction which NLNico pointed out. All the best!
