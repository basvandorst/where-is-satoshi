Thanks for the info. I can look into it if the 'child pays for parent' option mynameislongerthanyo suggested is a no go. I'm comfortable with command line/terminal stuff so I can figure it out if needs be.

That's actually quite sad. I had no idea there was a point armory could have been no more.

Thanks for the suggestion. I might just give this a go as having to download the blockchain to my PC feels like a bit of a waste of space!

Legend. Thank you so much for your help!

I figured this was the case and have since done a few other transactions with the correct fees that have gone through on the next block! Last time I used armory the default 0.0001 fee was fine, should have done my research before hand but I didn't think things would have changed so much.

Thanks for the list. Decided to go with Genesis Mining who are second  on the top rated list there so I believe its not a scan and I can afford to take the chance if it doesn't pay off.

Figured as much. Have moved away from using Armory and now understand how fees and satoshi/byte works now :)
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:19:08
So I've tried making a 'child pays for parent' transaction but it appears Armory can't handle it always throws an error 'tx broadcast timed out'. 
I tried moving a small amount from my primary address to my change address, then from the change address to a new address, both of which worked fine and were confirmed quickly with the correct fees (thank you).
Armory still shows the value in the change address as spendable funds but fails every time I try to transfer it to kick off the 'child pays for parent'. 
Looks like I've just got to wait it out.
@_date: 2016-11-25 06:46:18
Yes, it is now. It went through after 28.5 hours
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:44:52
Your instructions were clear, don't worry about that. It was just Armory not allowing me to send the transaction. As soon as the original transaction confirmed and the change was officially spendable I was able to send the change elsewhere.
Have moved away from using Armory now for this reason, the fee not being dynamic, and a couple of other performance reasons. Now I have a better understanding I hope I wont need to use CPFP or RBF in future :)
Thanks again for your help.

OK, will disregard blockchain.info's priority from now on then, thanks for the info!
Ah very clever. So I've moved over to looking at the transaction on BlockTrail.com 
If I understand what you are saying I would send the change to the original wallet with a high fee. In doing so this means the current, low fee, transaction also has to be included?
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:39:18
What fee did you use? 
The link that posted  was really helpful for me as Armory doesn't seem to have dynamic fees like some wallets.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:29:51
OK so in the grand scheme of things, its not a huge saving.
Appreciate the advice though! As I said I thought about creating a new wallet and dumping Armory so this might be my first job tonight.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:55:16
Appreciate your comment. I had already read this similar comment on another thread :)
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:58:20
I figured as much. Wish I'd thought about it more at the time but I was rushing to send the payment lol.
Am I right in thinking that if I leave the bitcoin core offline for over 72 hours the transaction will not be rebroadcast and it will be dropped from the mempool then eventually be returned to my wallet assuming it is still unconfirmed in that time?
If that is the case its probably the route I will take as either the transaction gets confirmed in that time or returned and can be submitted again with a higher fee.

This was created in 2014. Were uncompressed keys the standard back then? Seems I would be better creating a fresh one.
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:28:31
Oh right! So lets say I setup a fresh wallet with compressed keys, with the 0.0022 BTC change I could send 0.0012 to the new wallet with a 0.001 fee (essentially zeroing the change wallet) to get a much higher change of being in the next block therefore confirming BOTH transaction.
Makes sense! Thank you for your suggestion!
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:34:57
Thank you all for the help. Fully understand the mistake I've made and how to deal with it now.
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:35:09
Ah I did think the unconfirmed transactions seemed high! I was watching them start around 55K yesterday and slowly tick down to sub 19K. Sitting at 21K at time of this post (

Given Litecoin is about to make Segwit live in the next few hours I expect Bitcoin will wait and see how that turns out. Assuming all goes well I wouldn't be surprised if we see a push for it on the Bitcoin network too. Until then don't think anything will happen to improve the unconfirmed transaction situation...
