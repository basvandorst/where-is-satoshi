Where all those p2p Bitcoin exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:53:54
The current Segwit implementation in Bitcoin Core is almost useless, because outputs from generated segwit wallets will be send to legacy addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:56:41
Now imagine that you have to transfer just 2 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:35:11
it's useless now because outputs will be addresses of legacy format
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:24:52
you HODLers don't realize yet that if merchants will abandon Bitcoin it would hurt its value dramatically. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:43
Show this post to Bitcoin core team, because most of wallet software and merchant software is based on Bitcoin core API which still does not allow creating segwit wallets. Surprised? I'm sure this is the main reason why so many exchanges have not adopted Segwit addresses yet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:52:41
My transaction value was just 2 BTC and I paid $1800. Was it reasonable too?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:20
Your math is completely off. A transaction fee is calculated based on the number of inputs, not transaction value.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:13:50
It was quite big - 53kb, but it had to be sent. And it was 3 days ago. I guess it would be more expensive now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:52:43
There is no need to enforce it. All is needed is to provide developers with the ability to generate Segwit address. As of now, Bitcoin core API lacks this functionality, so most of merchant and wallet software can create only "normal" addresses. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:56:01
The problem is that Bitcoin core API does not support it neither. And most of wallet software is  based on their RPC API.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:38
I won't do this because it is linked to my exchange account. You can just pick any large transaction from any recent block and check out the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:33:34
First, Bitcoin Core will need to enable Segwit wallets in their software. Lack of this functionality is the major hurdle in Segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:26:42
here is one 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:05
Do you know when it will be deployed? People need to move their coins right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:30
What if i have to?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:45:06
As an example, $1300 fee for the transaction with the size less than 10 kb 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:51:57
**Why isn't everybody is using Segwit yet?**
Because most of wallet software, including custom software used by merchants, is based on Bitcoin core, which DOESN'T ALLOW GENERATING SEGWIT ADDRESSES ITSELF. Surprise? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:19
This 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:21:09
It's not about GUI. Most of wallet and merchant software is based on Bitcoin Core RPC that still does not allow generating Segwit wallets.

Great article. How did your project go?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:42
This [change]( addresses the problem, but it is not integrated into Bitcoin core yet.

Only you can save Bitcoin.

If downvotes such a pain in the ass for Theymos, he could just stop posting for a while until things have calmed down.

I believe even this  is enough to put him into jail. Nobody with that level of incompetence should ever be able to touch other people's money.

A New York license allows one to operate legally in New York only, not the entire country.

i would be very concerned if i had bitcoins, but luckily i sold all of mine already
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:38:45
I have one, I like it, it works but I don't use it because Bitcoin price is falling down.
@_date: 2016-01-13 18:10:19
Coindesk just became even shittier than before..
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:07:07
..because independent journalism is better for Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-03-30 07:25:27
Coindesk has been recently acquired by Bitcoin venture capitalists, who are large holders of coins definitely.
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:13:18
Sometimes it can take 10 hours for transaction to be confirmed or it may never be confirmed. No reason to be concerned at all.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:42:27
Be careful with your desires..

Your name is Satoshi, right?

Let's wait for Bitcoin hardfork. Then, you'll see how wrong hardforks can go.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:16:59
I did not get your irony
@_date: 2015-08-25 05:59:18
On another hand, if bitcoin price will be $10, it doesn't mean bitcoin is any less solid of a technology.

Sell stocks of Internet companies if you got any

Dot-com bubble collapsed. The closest analogy here would be ICO mania.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:22:09
Why it won't be? That would be another strong evidence how unreliable the current financial system is.
@_date: 2015-08-11 06:34:04
check the comments from this guy 
Every comment includes the link to his shady exchange. Be careful!
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:52:24
Thanks for reply. Looking forward for updates from the core team.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:00:26
Honestly speaking it sounds scary.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:30:53
Selling stocks of Internet companies?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:09:58
If it's opt-in, why there is no corresponding option in the config file? The problem is that there is no easy way for software based on Bitcoin RPC to programmably generate segwit addresses.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:49:06
Thanks for the link. sudo apt-get remove bitcoinxt

Each day bitcoin price becomes more and more affordable.
@_date: 2016-02-04 10:27:37
Lower BTC rates is common to local exchanges. It would be interesting to see how Rebit is compared to Western Union.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:09:05
 Seeing ~80,000 unconfirmed transactions is a bit worrisome. What would happen if someone else will run one more (or many) stress tests?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:11:13
And, I'm calling Bitcoin core team out 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:22:10
What's wrong? By many, Bitcoin is named the second greatest invention after the Internet.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:35:59
I've received it too. What can be implications if i used Coinbase back then to sell substantial amounts of BTC to my BoA account, given that I'm neither an US citizen nor a resident. And I closed my bank account a couple years ago.
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:54:14
i don't agree that the price matters. Yen is 400x cheaper than Kuwait dinar. Is it that much less popular? The technology behind Bitcoin is great, no matter what its price is: $250 or $0.5. But for mass adoption  $0.5 would be better.
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:13:06
It is clear that someone is manipulating the price with low liquidity BTC-E order book. What's next? BTC-E disappears with all of accumulated funds? 10k dump?
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:59:25
Merchants will definitely need to make changes in the code, fix bugs, etc. Very few of them would want to invest their time into learning about .NET crap.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:44:21
My theory it that right now Bitcoin price is being heavily manipulated to go up. Look at those 500 BTC orders on Bitfinex. As pumpers spend lots of money on Bitfnex and possibly on some major chinese exchanges, they put other exchanges such as Kraken under DDOS attack.

Can someone ELI5 me on why everyone is so excited about this new exchange? What its advantage over other US exchanges (Coinbase)?
