Hope u r trolling brah.

Get out now if you need the cash. When gox opens it will get worse.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:59:45
top lel. How would you call this then? A correction?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:42:00
If you need the money, sell now. When MTGOX opens things are probably going to look worse.

Hail glorious bitcoin early adopter masterrace

Lol. What do you want to say? That bitcoin has peaked and is now in decline? Cause that is pretty much the general investors-consensus on Apple stock at the moment.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:44:30
This.

Someone is selling close to $2.000.000 in bitcoins. This is it.

bitcoinity, just switch from market to market to get a balanced value.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:20
Right now? Probably. Tomorrow? Maybe with 50.000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:51
How much total?

K. My dad bought a Nokia that month i believe.

Not massively undervalued. Don't parrot what you have read in financial newspapers. 
Competition for smartphones is intensifying, key markets for tablets are beginning to get saturated, Desktop market is in decline, and analysts (and myself too, though that doesn't count for much) have question marks regarding the initial public acceptance of wearable computing, i.e. the iWatch.
So I wouldn't say their stock is undervalued, personally.

Go back in time a few years.
