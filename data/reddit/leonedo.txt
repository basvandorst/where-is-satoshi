There are actually several people on social media saying that they are being scare with a posible charge of “strategic resource smuggling” when the national guard find gold jewelry and also it’s really common for national guards to steal peoples Dollars.. they are robing you in their uniform... but they will make you lose your flight and threaten to send you to jail... 
Soo I’m not saying this happen... but sadly it’s actually posible..

Traki it’s like Walmart only in the type of stuff they sell, it’s a big department store that sell cheep stuff.. but it’s not really that big. 
It does have a big store in most city’s and its run by corrupt business men with close ties with the government with lots reports of money laundry..

You are right that’s also true, just not the only case.. my information comes from.. well myself.. I’m Venezuelan and me and a lot of people I know use localBTC to send money to our families. (Most people use underground exchanges, but using localBTC it’s a lot easier and safer) 
It’s an easy way send money without giving a big chunk of money to the government..

The main drive for BTC in Venezuela is not to fight inflation, it’s to bypass regulation... you can’t legally buy dollars (even If a new law say you can). 
Most people use it to move money in and out of the country, that’s why the price does not matter that much..

A lot of people are sending money from others countries to their families in Venezuela.. so yes a lot of regular people are into it.. 
Of course that with all the international sanctions against corrupt government official there sure is a lot of money laundry.. and yes the money wash is mostly from people and crime organizations close to the government.
