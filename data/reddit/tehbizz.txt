Extremely unlikely to happen as it seems only the trade orders were backed up.  I pulled out all my funds to CoinEx -- save SRC/SBC -- and they went through very fast and nothing disappeared.

Tell that to Iceland, they're loaded with guns and practically no gun-related violence.  Stop being an idiot parroting talking points.

Other things that kill:
* Cars
* Cigarettes
* Glass
* Concrete
* Smog
* Rocks
* Falling rocks
* Motorcycles
* Wire
* String
* Knives
* Lava
* Meteors
And I could go on.  I am sure some of those things you do not consider bad even though they can kill and have documented proof of doing so in the past.  But like I said, agree to disagree.  This little back-and-forth will continue otherwise.

Withdraw your coins to another exchange, problem fixed.  I jumped to CoinEx and haven't had a single problem yet.  My withdraws from Cryptsy came through very fast (except for IFC).

Many upboats to you.  I'm trying to mimic what you've suggested.  While I have very little invested monetarily -- all my value so far is from mining -- I'm putting in all my sell orders beforehand whenever I get X amount of BTC.  That way I just don't have to stare at bitcoinwisdom and worry myself, if it sells, it sells and if not, it will eventually.

And that's the rub.  The problem with doing country comparisons is that they all differing degrees of crime rates (for different weapons), culture, population, laws, and so forth.  As you said, the UK has very little gun-related violence.  Well, that makes sense, it's a huge pain to get one, so you've got much higher incidence of stabbings.  Canada has a lower gun violence rate than the US yet has nearly as many guns in circulation in relation to population size.  IIRC, both Germany and Switzerland have populations awash in guns, but little gun-related violence.  And it sounds crazy but even places like Afghanistan are flush with guns and in the general population, gun violence rates aren't as high as they should be given how many guns are _made_ in that country every year.
Even here in the US, gun violence rates vary greatly by state.  You have some states where ownership is extremely high (Texas, Alabama, Georgia) yet not everyone's out shooting each other, and inversely, places with lower ownership relative to population (Illinois) have higher rates.  But everyone thinks we're all just running around, toting guns and popping off every few days.


That indeed is the problem, but not for the reason you said.  The gun isn't necessarily the issue, the people are.  Stupid or irresponsible people are the problem, a gun (or other weapon) doesn't change that.  Weapon prohibition isn't a solution.  Recent history has made it more than abundantly clear that if people want a weapon, they're going to get it and you can't stop that.  Even in the UK, if a thug wants a gun, they can certainly get one easier than you can despite current restrictions.

Agree to disagree.  There's more than enough data on both sides of the argument to ~~disprove~~ cogently dismantle arguments of the other side.
edit: changed disprove, it didn't sound right.
