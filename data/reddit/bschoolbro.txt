Doesn't have to be a bet against the bitcoin, you can both long and short

Good, acknowledge your shortcomings. You clearly don't know what you are doing, have no self restraint and have learned nothing over fucking 10 years. Either buy small and hold or stop touching risky investments. How can you not make money off the stock market in the longest rally ever? I'll tell you, because you trade and make dumb trades buying high and selling low. If you invested all of your money in an US ETF and never looked back, you'd have doubled your money. No stress, no time consumption, nothing. Instead, you are literally gambling on bitcoin.

Very easy to say. You know what most will do? It tanks 20%, they buy happily. Oh shit... it just went down another 10% in 10 minutes.... wait fuck, it's down another 20% already in an hour??? SELL SELL SELL!!!

Ahahahahahahah, funny thing is you're actually serious too.

At some point 1$ was the ATH

Lol, are you new around here? I don't mean Reddit, but the internet in general...

"Right now it's damn good at storing large sums of value and retaining integrity with zero maintenance, outperforming many securities and commodities out there."
No it's not... Tell me, if you suddenly inherited a million dollars, would you put it all into bitcoin? No, because it's NOT a good way to store large sums of money. Yes, it is outperforming many securities, but it is also exponentially more volatile.

You may think that, but you're objectively wrong. Yes, might be true if you invest in a single property and are very unlucky (timing/tenant wise)... while one should rather invest in a diversified REIT.

In theory you are right; unfortunately, in practice private banks DO have influence on the political process and vice versa. It is logical too, banks are systematically important to the economy. A supermarket going bankrupt sucks for the people working there, but that's about it.

Use your brain again properly. It was obviously edited after.

No it's not. Shorting a currency is the same thing as loaning it and promising to pay it back at a later date + interest.

If you had ever educated yourself even in economics 101, you'd know never to use the word always. And you use it so often too ��.
Correcting you would be like trying to explain to a child how the entire universe works.

How about common sense? The average person is not that well versed in technology. An app on their phone which was there from the start should feel pretty trustworthy, such as whatever browser/e-mail application is standard on your phone.

So you paid your house in bitcoin? Your mortgage in bitcoin? Your groceries in bitcoin? Alright buddy.

Based on your comments I'm pretty sure you don't have many friends (if, at all) that don't really give a fuck about technology. A messaging app (Whatsapp/viber/kik/etc) and FB is really all they need. 


Haha calm down armchair scientist. I'm not gonna go scouring the internet for an obscure study that probably does not exist or is incredibly hard to find.
