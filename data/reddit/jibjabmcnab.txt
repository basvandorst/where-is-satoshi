Thanks I will be trying this, I just wanted to check as the website states "delayed transactions that at least include a fee of 0.0001BTC/KB" does my transaction meet this criteria? on my transaction it shows (Fee per byte: 56.302 sat/B) &amp; the transaction size is: 486 (bytes)

Ok great thanks.

Unfortunately "Abandon Transaction" is greyed out along with "increase transaction fee"

I finally got a request in on Viabtc for a 56.302 sat/B transaction and it stated that the fee was too low so this is not the case...

This is actually really concerning, every day there are more and more posts of stuck transactions (mine included) and there is always just one or 2 replies basically saying, "meh, maybe you'll never get it back" it's all a bit of a mess at the minute...

So I would do this in my new wallet &amp; then send from the non segwit address to the new (starting with 3) address correct? are there any limitations or reasons not to use a segwit address over the standard addresses?

Hopefully that is the case but your first comment says different "I believe there is a problem with the current network design that allows transactions to stay in the mempool indefinitely."

Great thanks, this has worked for the core wallet but not for abc, any further suggestions for the abc wallet?

which would be your preference?
