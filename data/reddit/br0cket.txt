I looked to see if you're a troll, sorry. I'll assume you're not and that your question on this post is legit. If I had 10,000BTC, I'd sell some, not all. How much you sell would depend on your own need and comfort with BTC price volatility.

Found a five month old post from this guy "What are the smartest scams? The ones you have seen or even fell for, or ones that you heard of that you thought were really well thought out."

The batteries used in UPS systems in Pakistan are not Litium Ion. They are old school car batteries that can barely power couple of fans, lightbulbs etc for few hours. With 100+F temps, everybody needs airconditioning but you can only power those by natural gas/petrol generators that are very popular across Pakistan. Most can't afford it however. As for solar, the govt. has slapped a 32% import tax on solar panels. The country is run by class A nitwits..

You'd be selling bitcoins to buy the car so its not exactly HODL. SODL is more like it

Institutional investing phase hasn't begun yet. They don't send billions to shady exchanges in Eastern Europe. That'll probably be the next bubble once ETFs and other legit investment vehicles are launched after regulatory issues are ironed out. On a different note "lol my friends are idiots" phase should really be the Goxed phase.

Real wealth is in production and labor, not in currency. A currency can be anything as long as a government accepts it as legal tender for tax payments.

No one can predict bottom. My comment is pure speculation based on consolidation in the $150-$200 range prior to the current bubble. News does not appear to effect the larger downward trend at the moment. At some point it will reverse, no doubt about that. With 100s of millions invested in bitcoin startups, we'll see some cool stuff in the near future..
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:34:16
If bitcoin is flawed how come silicon valley is dumping tens of millions of dollars into bitcoin startups and infrastructure. It WILL get better. There is still time. Volatility is nothing new. Bagholders from $1200/BTC might not see that.

This is the same issue Paul Krugman had brought up 
I am yet to see a definitive answer to this.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:56:57
Its because most people are unable to understand and appreciate the technology behind bitcoin. Without that it'd appear to be a bad investment based on greed and short-term gains

We were in a bubble. Now going to pre bubble levels of $150-$200

Airport scanners can detect the metal strips inside paper currency. They cannot tell denomination of the bills but number of bills. So best to not carry more than the 10k limit

IMO when the average person can do things with bitcoin that are impossible with existing financial tools or prohibitive in some way. For example international remittance, micro payments etc.
