From the stuff I was reading, and not that I understand much behind it, that first dip was wave three of an Elliot wave pattern, we then had wave 4 on the return up and we're now on the final wave 5 down before we return to an up trend - apparently!

Can we turn this around yet? :)

I’d close that account and move to a new bank if they don’t want your business.

What’s this I’m seeing about segwit2x coming back on the 28th of December. Is this fake or genuine?

I used bitstamp the last couple of weeks after having previously used coinbase whilst I was testing the crypto water. Found it to be much better value and better for ‘larger’ sums. Coinbase is super convenient though.

Bought some more. Higher than I wanted but I felt myself falling in to the same trap of waiting and sure enough it is now a higher price than I bought for. Saved some funds to take advantage if a dip does occur. Bases covered!

This seems to only go up? ��

He’s all in in garlicoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:50:20
Ha! Strapping in! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:21:09
Best one I’ve seen yet. Except I’m not totally convinced 8k was the bottom. We’ll find out in the next week!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:26:26
I’m not worried. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:36:39
I don’t think that does it justice. Tough times! 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:40:29
Did we finish dipping yet? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:24:32
I think you got confused with gay chain. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:47:03
Same here! Getting a bit frustrating now! I keep having to increase my price alerts - I should have bought earlier.... Hopefully it tanks a bit! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:00:39
I like to think of it as informed gambling ��. And if you spread your investments there’s a better risk/ reward balance in the long term and of ‘striking gold’. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:41:17
Yep, made a mistake waiting for the drop I thought would happen but never came. Fear of being caught on a spike /\. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:23:05
Not even the drop I was hoping for so I could buy in again at a better price. Doh. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:21:25
It was riveting  -_-
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:18:13
I wish. It doesn’t look like it’s moving south even after that call and lack of anything bitcoin. I’d like to buy in some more and it’s not falling fast enough (or at all!). 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:07:33
Predictably that call was just full of boring financials and nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:31:02
Home of the stunning Torres del Paine. Nice wine too ;). 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:49:01
This is me. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:40:37
Its riveting stuff...
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:57:40
Waiting for dip here too. Taking its time! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:36:15
Ditto! I was sat on a nice profit before recent events which I’d made since the end of the summer. Actually dipped into loss territory briefly at one point and now back but higher than breakeven now. Quite a big reason for that was buying more btc at 13k and 11k (exactly one day before the bigger dumps we had - doh) and buying alts which didn’t handle the dump too well! Onwards and upwards! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:58:58
Not at all. Admittedly BTC does have an overwhelming effect on the market at the moment but in a longer term strategy providing you’ve picked projects which have solid fundamentals, teams and use cases etc. they’ll probably outperform BTC. And certainly if you plan on holding for 10 years. Just make sure you do your research and pick carefully. Over time the reliance on BTC will hopefully lessen as more options for trading fiat to tokens arise. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:31:18
All I see is the price shot up again whilst I was waiting for 'a dip' to buy. Argh. Nothing goes up in a straight line - apart from bitcoin when I keep staring at it too long.
