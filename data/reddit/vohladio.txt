Yes, when somebody goes into your apartment and takes things that are yours it is stealing.  Your point?

What wallet did you use?  
When you created your new wallet you hopefully recorded a string of words called a seed or you saved some private keys.  If you can't find any backups, seeds, or keys - you're fucked.

Etherium is another cryptocurrecy that uses it's own blockchain.  It is different from BTC in that you can put code into it's blockchain and the code will be run.  The code is called a 'smart contract'.  Somebody created a huge smart contract called TheDAO which allowed investors to crowdfund TheDAO and then vote on which startups to invest the fund into.  TheDAO raised 150 000 000 USD worth of ETH very quickly.  But just yesterday, somebody found a flaw in the code of TheDAO's smart contract which allowed them to move about 50 000 000 USD worth of ETH from TheDAO's main fund into an address that they control.  So they "stole" a bunch of money from the investors of the DAO (there are about 25 000 of them).  But it isn't really "stealing" because he simply exploited a flaw in the code and the investors knew the risks before they put money into it.
Now there is a discussion happening about how to respond to this.  They can either A) Do nothing and let this guy walk with 50 mill or B) Get the majority of ETH miners to agree to fork the ETH blockchain, effectively erasing the transaction where this guy took the funds, then return all ETH to DAO investors and disband the fund.
Option B would be bad for Ethereum's and crypto's reputation overall because it sets a precedent that a few leaders can undo transactions in an apparently decentralized network if they don't like them.
This podcast explains it well.  You should also check out part 2.

I found Andreas's intervews on the JRE useful.

This was probably the weakest of his four appearances on JRE.  But I think that was Joe's fault.  He didn't really engage Andreas the way that he should have and just joked around instead.

Thank you so much!
Is there a place that I can buy it with BTC?  Somewhere other than amazon.com?
EDIT:  I have figured out that I can order it from the TREZOR website with BTC.  However, it doesn't say what country it ships from?

He is talking about the seed that you can use to backup your wallets.  Electrum and Mycelium both use them.
