You might also want to consider something like the tesla powerwall. Not sure on prices in Australia but they're not as expensive as I expected them to be. Point being if your solar panels are producing excess electricity it would be stored on the power wall and you can extend the period of free electricity you had (minus the setup costs of the power wall) bit over a (probably longish) time period the money saved would pay for the power wall and start earning profit. Would also have other benefits like of you had a power cut you  would have 10kw of power as backup.
In the UK you can get cheaper power in the evening so you can charge the power wall up at night when electricity is cheap and use this electricity in the day when its more expensive.
Edit: on phone forgive the misspellings

I had to deal in bcash last week and when I sent my bcash I got an email from bitcoin.com saying I'd sent x.xx BTC from my wallet but I had sent Bcash not BTC...

HODL, yes!

Goo luck OP! Thinking of buying some myself but no where near your amount.

I've used Shakepay which was ok but some teething problems getting it to use shakepay as my default contactless payment method. It's only available in some countries.

Great work this is brill

I've got the same issue, I'm thinking the best way is to
1. Buy BTC
2. Use [Shapeshift]( to convert BTC into BTH and deposit into my BCC wallet
3. Send BCC to Bitmains wallet
4. Use [Shapeshift]( to transfer the BTH to BTC and get rid of them shitcoins and keep hodling
I'm not sure whether to use [Shapeshift]( to convert my BTC to BCC and deposit it directly into Bitmains account though and save myself a transaction fee. Guidance would be appreciated!

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:55:03
They already exist on telegram :) 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:34:48
I was thinking the same!
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:37:37
Remember to HODL and you will make it back alive!

I've got a spare pi I'd like to setup a node, does it use a lot of bandwidth?
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:17:18
Holy shit! Thanks for the link this is mental.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:18:46
Not sure if genius intent or hilarious mistake? Love it either way though haha

You're actually incorrect. I know of at least 2 Federal agents that have been charged with stealing BTC, Carl force and Shaun Bridges from the Silk Road case.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:26:56
Tbh I don't think so. Thank you for clarity.
