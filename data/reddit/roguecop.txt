That's a big sell signal, trust the class on this one.

Erlich mines Bitcoin from the house in S.2, actually its  Gilfoyle  but whatever.

It's futures being liquidated by commercial class investors nothing more. Short, long, bart, inverse bart and so on...

BTC along with the rest of the market that follows its every move(except when it's going up) fate is governed by the liquidation of futures from commercial investors. Most have given up the delusion that there is any sane motivation otherwise to push it up or down. The forces at work go long, and then go short, long, short, short, long, etc.  this is clearly displayed on charts in the "Bart" pattern unique to crypto currency. It's bullshit, I have yet to find a way to protect those long liquidations, anybody know of anything, site or app that does that?

We are possibly beginning a very common descending triangle here. RSI is badly over bought on weekly and hard bearish divergence on daily. It would require a massive outside commercial investment to push much higher, as much of the existing market is holding. Trade with caution.

Always enjoy a little gallows humor among all the doom and gloom...

Such a long long time ago, almost like a dream of a far distant past. Why does life in general go by so fast but so damn slow in crypto currency? It's these damn bear runs that seem to last forever.

Based on this I sold everything I owned and put it in BTG. What could be better than regular Bitcoin? Gold Bitcoin, FTW!
