Or we just stop paying taxes, and the state disappears. Or enslaves us all. Not sure which one. In any case, if they acted out of aggression at least we would see the state for what it truly is, a violent, coercive apparatus.

Exactly. Whatever form Bitcoin takes, that we find value in, will be the unltimate form. There is no government agency making it so. That is capitalism. Or I should say anarcho-capitalism. 
Even though we understand it might be overtaken by a select few, we are still free to choose, not ordered to by an edict of the state. Socialism would not give us that choice.

I'm gonna say capitalism, only because I'm pretty sure all forms of socialism are based on centralized control of the means of production. Meaning banks and currency would be under that control. Capitalism is really just freedom. Freedom to do what you want and freedom to discover and find value in things. The fact that we find value in Bitcoin is purely capitalistic in nature because there is no coercion.

I wonder if you're right. Is the idea of monetary equality a socialist idea or a capitalist? I wonder if the ideas of true free market capitalism cannot lead to this equality. I think for so long the masses have been told only government redistribution of wealth is the only way to achieve this, where as I see it, only true freedom and free markets would lead to this equality, only because no institution would be propped up by a government entity. But maybe the philosophy behind Bitcoin is socialism? I just always thought socialism in involved some amount of force.
