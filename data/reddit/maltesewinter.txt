Reason i asked that is I wasn't able to withdraw anything from my margin account if I had open trades.
Can you explain how hackers would be able to circumvent this restriction? I thought they only  comprimosed btc wallets?

This! We want an independent audit of everything.

Are u srsly going to verify tens of thousands of requests at this time? How long will that take?
Why should ppl trust you with their IDs when you cant even keep their cash safe. Last time i checked your joke exchange required 4 seperate documents including 2 IDs. Ive traded everything and noone requires this much.
Just wire our money and fuck off quietly into the  night. Some ppl shouldn't be in business.

Oh now u want to talk legal. U guys are the last to speak on legality with your gross negligence and incompetence.
And dont talk to me about simple after u lost our money. You're NOT in a position to make demands anymore
Give us our money back asap. Theres a big difference between doing asking basic KYC and ASKING FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOCUMENTS.
Your stupid kyc system was clearly designed to disincentive bank wires. This is no longer needed since ur going out of business.
Bitcoins are gone. We cant trade our BTC for USD since trading will be disabled. So now you have 10000s of customers asking for verification. Are you gonna let this drag on for weeks?
How about switching to a simple ID system like local bitcoins uses coupled with checking if bank details match the name on ID?
PS nothing personal zane, speaking to you as a rep of bitfinex

I would strongly advise against early USD withdrawals by already verified customers.
The backlog or verying 1000s of new ppl will take weeks and by that time you could get hit with 'cease and desist' letter. This would leave u with much smaller pool of money cos all the verified ppl leaped frogged us.
I don't want my money shared in any future bunkrupsty because I wasn't verified. I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
Either all USD withdrawals leave together or none at all.

What if I have usd in my margin account with which ive taken a margin short bitcoins
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:50:44
Thats BS. Ive traded at lots of regular brokers and kyc is 1 ID to verify ur name, 1 to verify ur address. Not 4.
Get a different bank and dont hide behind 'kyc'.

Zane most of my stash was in my margin account almost fully margined. Could I be affected? (Could they still steal it)
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:06:56
Less then what now? The made up number bitfinex gave us? How about a 3rd party audit like many has requested?

If only btc wallets are compromised and not entire accounts, how can they withdraw coins i use as margin?
It should trigger the same error i would think since they're in use

He may win in the court of public opinion but he will lose in the actual court, I guarantee it.
