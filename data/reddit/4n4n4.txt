Somehow, I feel like the duplication of digital property (in general cases) doesn't equate to the duplication of physical assets in the real world. Besides, if objects in the real world could be duplicated in the same manner as data, we would all live in paradise and wouldn't even bother with squabbling over owning this-or-that ;)

Bitcoin really isn't built to be used this way, and it's strange that the merchant would handle it the way that they are here. Bitcoin simply isn't very good for instant payments--it's something payment channels might go a long way in solving, but as it stands, it has a lot of problems. Merchants can accept unconfirmed transactions and take on the risks involved, but this one chose not to and instead opts for a very problematic policy which they don't seem to have a good resolution mechanism for either. Asking for a confirmation in 15 minutes is a game of luck; even if you send with a high enough fee to almost certainly be included in the next block, there's no way to know when the next block will be mined. It will likely be in under 10 minutes, but it could also be in 20 minutes, or even over an hour. No one has any control over this, so sometimes the customer will just get screwed because of bad luck, no matter what he does.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:54:41
A "normal" wait time for the transaction to be sent is within a few seconds to propagate and be visible across the network, then confirmation time will depend on the fees paid. If it takes more than a few seconds for other nodes to see the transaction and have it show up on block explorers, then it's probably the fault of the service you're using to send with (Coinbase in this case).
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:19:45
This could be a *huge* deal. Bitcoin's design is inherently terrible for situations where you need instant confirmations--some people will say that 0-conf is/was fine without RBF, but this simply isn't true--but LN or something similar has the potential to actually make secure, instant transactions with Bitcoin a reality.

We don't know what Dotcom is planning exactly here--it could be a payment channel, it could be some centralized thing--we just don't know.

Buying Bitcoin is not a frictionless process, and what will Megaupload offer above existing mechanisms like torrents that will justify the effort to switch your cash for magic internet money?
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:11:11
Absolutely! Impact on the UTXO set was a large consideration of Core's design of segwit which led to the decision to discount witness data, since witness data does not contribute to the UTXO set. The increased capacity segwit immediately provides comes from this discount, which replaces the current blocksize limit (1MB made up of both witness and transaction data) with a "block cost" limit ("1MB" made up of transaction data + (witness data / 4)). In effect this creates the potential to include more data (more transactions) per block, but has a much lower impact on the UTXO set than a straight blocksize increase would.
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:07:09
Yeah, if things collapsed on a large scale now, Bitcoin doesn't have a chance in hell of absorbing that fallout. Not at 1MB blocks, not at 10MB blocks, not at 100MB blocks. Bitcoin development is still very much a work in progress.

Certainly for uploaders this seems like it could be a great utility--heck, I plan to host content in the future which *might* benefit from this sort of model--but I have a hard time seeing downloaders going out of their way to buy Bitcoin en masse just to use something like this. There exist a lot of options already for downloading things over the internet, so asking people to jump through hoops to use this implementation in particular just seems like a stretch to me.
Though to be honest, I've always found these monetized file-hosting services to be a pain in the ass. There are so damn many of them, and people will host stuff on this-that-or-the-other site, all of which will ask you to pay for a "premium" membership or whatever--then all it takes is for one person to throw whatever that gated file is into a torrent and boom, all the paywalls come crumbling down. I guess with all the paying users Megaupload had back in the day that some people found their service valuable, but I don't know; I wasn't one of them.

Whether they have the "right" or not, they have the *ability*; where there's a will, there's a way, as it were. The technology enables it, and thus when people feel it is in their interests to do so, they will act accordingly.
Otherwise, I'd be hesitant about equating "piracy" to "stealing", as there are important differences between the two in the digital space. Stealing is generally characterized by a removal of a possession from one party by another, an important feature of this being that the victim party no longer has access to the stolen item. In the case of digital property (and ideas, though this is its own case), this is rarely how it works, as digital property is rarely "stolen", so much as it's "copied"--except for Bitcoins; those get stolen ;). You'll see a lot of numbers published by interested parties reporting losses as a result of piracy where they'll do things like count downloads from some site as lost sales, when this is not necessarily the case. If a person were to download a pirated copy of something (or a hundred copies for that matter) and still purchase the product, before or after the fact, that does not financially translate to a lost sale. In such cases, there is no loss to the creator as a sale was generated regardless. Pirating something which a person might otherwise not have been interested in could also spark unexpected interest, essentially working as advertising. Or maybe they just pirated something and won't ever pay the creators, cuz hell yeh they got dem free DLs.
tl;dr piracy and theft are functionally different and the issue is far from black and white. However, there is evidently demand for this sort of distribution mechanism, and it's not going anywhere.

Some nodes will need to keep all the history, as this is required initially to sync a full node, even if you plan to prune afterwards. Maybe in the future there will be a scheme which distributes different parts of the blockchain randomly between "pruned" peers such that users all with partial histories can help one another fully sync when required, but to my knowledge, this is not an existing feature.

Well, if people are downloading and enjoying content from said uploader, then the uploader *is* providing something of value (distribution, essentially). Not that content creators don't deserve to be compensated (likely more than anyone) for their creations, but distributors (legal or otherwise) can also provide useful services. For example, it can be difficult to acquire the full discography of a given artist, legally or otherwise, and it's very convenient if someone is able to host a collection of such, nicely organized and everything.

Sure it was; the assertion was that Bitcoin has the "best" scaling, which I would assume refers not to just throughput, but also efficiency, sustainability, and so-on. There are plenty of altcoins with potentially higher throughput capacity than Bitcoin, but what is being suggested is that they do not have better solutions to scaling (which is true).
Though if you want to talk scaling without regard to other considerations, FIAT is clearly the champion.

A blocksize increase is possible in the future, but the "final" blocksize the system might end up at is very much up in the air.

Do you only plan to buy one thing, one time, from one vendor? If so, then LN is not going to help you with your single purchase. On the other hand, if you plan to purchase many things over time from many vendors, it may be beneficial to have a LN channel open which would let you send payments for all those purchases without having to throw every one of them on the blockchain.

I'd recommend 
OpenTimestamps batches a large number of different people's proofs into a single merkle root, which is then added to the blockchain in a single OP_RETURN--massively more scalable than using a transaction for every document. As a proof of concept, OpenTimestamps was used [to timestamp every page on The Internet Archive]( proofs of which are all contained in a single Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:48:06
A "vbyte" is a directly comparable metric for calculating fees or relative block space usage against legacy transactions. "Sipa" is being used as a synonym for "weight unit", which is how transactions are actually accounted for in Bitcoin today (and has been since I believe 0.13.0). A transaction's size in vbytes is just its weight divided by four. For transactions from legacy addresses, vbytes will be the same as bytes, but for transactions that have different witness data weighting (segwit addresses, possibly later confidential transactions or other developments) vbytes will be smaller than bytes. When paying fees, estimators should be looking at the feerate/vbyte, rather than the feerate/byte (or just always use weight), as this gives a proper comparison of the fees required for different types of transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:29:02
Well, if you prune, then you don't even need to hold it on disk. As the article says, signatures only need to be validated once, at which point you never need to look at them again. Thus, if you're pruning, you can just delete witness data entirely after you've validated it.
If you keep a full history of everything, then yes, you'll need to keep the witness data on disk as well. As for the UTXO set, my understanding is that most of it is actually also stored on disk and that only some of it stays in your system's memory, precisely because the set has become so large that it can be impractical to store it all in RAM. The drawback to this is that anything not stored in RAM will take longer to validate, thus why the cache exists to predict UTXOs which are more likely to be spent, and are thus kept in RAM so they can be validated faster if spent. It's probably fair to assume though that the larger a discrepancy that exists between how much is stored on disk and how much is stored in RAM, the more problematic validation will become. [Found an interesting little article here talking about the UTXO issue]( The author surprised me, too--this also seems to be from his 20MB block days, heh.

@_date: 2017-12-04 22:49:43
This is the correct answer. Even from a purely selfish standpoint, others using segwit will reduce your fees by increasing the amount of available block space. The only reason you might want others to not use segwit is if you care more about keeping blocks small than you do about paying fees (which for some people is probably true, but I'm guessing not most).
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:28:35
I had the pleasure around a week ago of doing my first segwit consolidation transaction (combining a bunch of segwit inputs into a single output). The witness discount for transactions with mostly inputs is pretty fantastic :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:21:29
"Sections" is the wrong way of looking at it. At a low level, [the blocksize limit has been replaced with a "block weight" limit]( Now, instead of a block being considered full when it hits 1 million bytes, it is full when it hits 4 million weight.
What does this mean in practice? It means that some data can be weighted differently depending on its costs to the network. Segwit is first to take advantage of this, with segwit witness data weighted at 1 weight unit/byte, while transaction data and legacy signatures are weighted at 4 weight units per byte. Do some simple example calculations and you'll easily see how a block with more witness data will be able to get more data in a block at the 4 million weight limit than one with less witness data.
Why does this result in lower fees? Because fees are now paid per weight unit or per virtual byte (vbytes are basically just weight divided by four). Since segwit transactions are weighted lower, you will pay lower fees on them, and there will be more space left in the weight limit for other people's transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:01:03
[Can start with all these reasons](
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:58:43
Except no one said that outside of the people who made their own private agreement which then no one supported. Segwit2x was not a Core initiative--in fact, none of the developers associated with it were consulted about 2x at all.
Also, if more people and services started using segwit, the blocksize would increase more, immediately. 2MB can be reached with segwit alone, and segwit is already active.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:45:46
It is considered valid but non-standard. Non-standard means that the node will receive it, but notice that it doesn't understand something about it and therefore it will not relay it to others or put it in its own blocks (if it's a miner). If other miners include it blocks, then the node will accept it as part of the chain.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:38:05
As an individual, using segwit does reduce your fees significantly, particularly if you're doing transactions that involve a lot of inputs. Maybe that alone doesn't seem huge, but the other direct effect of using segwit is that blocks will become larger, since more segwit transactions fit within the weight limit than non-segwit transactions. The result of this is that capacity is increased (and fees are lowered) in the exact same way as any other blocksize increase.
But you're absolutely right that the most important part of segwit is that it makes it possible to develop much more on top of it, but of course, all that stuff will take time. The fastest route to a capacity increase at the moment is to actually get people and services using segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:03:17
I don't disagree that understanding how weight works is a bit hard for some to grasp without a good explanation, but I do think that it's important when describing how the system works that it be described correctly. I suppose that a description using "sections" or something similar could be used as an analogy (say like luggage space costing less than people space on a plane) to give a rough idea of why the weight system can let more data into blocks, but it's probably good if such descriptions are clearly communicated as being analogies or approximations to reduce the spread of misunderstandings about how things actually work.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:23:48
It's definitely a transitional phase. Bitcoin is exiting its early stage where the block subsidy was responsible for securing the network and is moving into what was always known to be its future--a fee market where security is paid for by those transacting on the network. Better to learn how to work within a fee market now than when it gets even bigger and people are even more used to all their fees being subsidized by inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:18:07
You are correct that the size in vbytes of nested segwit address transactions is still significantly smaller than that of legacy transactions, despite the small added overhead. The easiest way to confirm this is to just make the transactions yourself and observe the results.

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:52:21
That's not how LN works. They open a channel (which is an on-chain Bitcoin transaction) that has the balance fully on your side. If the channel were closed immediately on opening (in which case you shouldn't have made one to begin with, but whatever), the balance would all go to you, since that's the current balance of the channel. Since the channel *is* a Bitcoin transaction, the exchange can't just revoke it and steal your coins or anything like that.
The benefit of this is that it gives you a spending channel that can be routed through the exchange (and whatever hops are required after that) to make cheap and instant transactions using Lightning.

Not necessarily. I'm not sure how Ledger and others have implemented it, but I do know that on a Bitcoin node at the moment the only way to make segwit addresses is to use the "addwitnessaddress" command *on an existing pubkey*. It's possible that what Ledger does is it generates addresses just as it always has, but for segwit then just does an addwitnessaddress on top of them. If so, the same seed would recover both the segwit and non-segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:29:26
As the person taking payments, you have no power to control what kind of address they send from, only the ability to post your own address for them to send to. If they send from legacy addresses, they won't be using segwit, but if they send from segwit addresses, then they are using segwit. If your receiving address is a segwit address, then when you spend those coins, you will be making a segwit transaction.

Yes. Segwit inputs will pay reduced fees regardless of what address you're sending to. Segwit transactions also free up more block weight for other transactions to use, which allows more transactions to fit in each block.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:22:42
P2SH-P2WPKH inputs use significantly less weight than legacy inputs, despite the bit of extra overhead, since they do use the segwit weighting. Just look at the vbytes compared to actual bytes of any segwit transaction to see what the difference is.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:37:17
If you look at [the state of the network today]( over 90% of nodes support and understand segwit. A small number of nodes have not upgraded to segwit supporting versions (0.13.1+ or equivalent), but the vast majority have.

We can already have significantly bigger blocks if services start using segwit addresses, which they *could* do much, much quicker than everyone could be convinced to do a contentious "upgrade". How many failed contentious forks have we gone through? How can you expect that *this time* it'll be easy to convince everyone to follow your blocksize bump? And besides, shitcoins will always be able to undercut Bitcoin's fees, because any unused trash will always be cheaper. Always.
Bitcoin is being scaled--[you can see much of the research and the work being done]( If you think that increasing throughput is important, then support the people actually working on improving Bitcoin. Stirring up an internet mob to push yet another contentious split (which it would absolutely be, guaranteed) is not productive.

Yes, it can go whatever way without issue. The segwit addresses currently in use were designed with backwards compatibility in mind, so they actually just look like any other P2SH address (addresses that start with 3, previously used mostly for multisig).

Just want to add to this to say that "on-chain" is not limited just to blocksize increases, and I think pretty much everyone is likely on-board with on-chain scaling that does not compromise other important properties like decentralization. For example, proposals like MAST and signature aggregation add better on-chain scaling to Bitcoin by reducing the amount of data required for transactions, in addition to the added functionality they provide.

Litecoin uses segwit, and has the same segwit data limit as Bitcoin does: 4 million weight units. This means it can have blocks between a maximum of 1-4MB, depending on their content. It also gets blocks 4x as often as Bitcoin, making for an effective 4-16MB (though above 8MB is impractical) in one of Bitcoin's block periods.

If they're generally honest, I suppose not.
But if we trust miners to do these things, then why bother with PoW? Pools could just pass around a spreadsheet with transactions on it and agree upon it. It'd be a lot cheaper than building weird computers to guess a lot of numbers at random. The trust model would be the same too, since the miners are the only ones who matter when it comes to maintaining the transaction list and the rules of the system. It wouldn't be necessary for other people to be able to validate it anyways, since the miners are going to act in their rational self-interest, and besides, even if they broke your rules, you were just going to follow their lead anyways.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:30:34


I think it's fine. Eventually we want all transactions to make use of segwit because it's generally just better for the network. The costing for segwit is meant to better reflect the resource costs involved, segwit transactions don't suffer from third party malleability, and they are faster to validate.
I'm not really interested in any blocksize increase beyond segwit until we see the results of introducing segwit, improvements on top of it (schnorr etc...), and 2nd layer scaling. Eventually I'd like to see a hardfork that does a bunch of things ([stuff from the wishlist, maybe?]( which might also do something with the blocksize, but that's up to the people who actually know what they're doing to figure out. At the moment, I really don't see a hardfork happening (and wouldn't want one just for the blocksize anyhow).

These are real blocks mined on testnet, where segwit is active.

The latter is more of an attack scenario that tries to push up the blocksize as much as possible, which would be a fairly useless attack to perform, but was worth testing.

My understanding here is that the problem would be measuring hashrate for all the tiny miners (relative to the total hashing power). Basically, the process of making blocks is what proves to the network that work is being done and that you did it. Every ten minutes, someone does enough work to solve a block, then tells others on the network "hey, I did the work to solve this block", and the others then verify that this is true and pass it around to everyone else.
When pools measure hashrate, they essentially do the same thing. Miners will be given "blocks" to work on of a severely reduced difficulty, and every time they solve for one of these, they prove it to the pool so that the pool knows that they're doing work. This works pretty well for pools, since pools should be running on pretty powerful servers and the communication is just between two parties for each miner (just the pool and that miner). However, doing this for the whole network wouldn't scale--you can't have every miner on the network announcing to everyone else every time they find a solution with 1 billionth of the difficulty required to find a block.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:34:03
 &gt; A database can be modified, the blockchain can not.
You can hash database entries so that changing past entries will make later entries invalid. This isn't a property of PoW--it's just cryptography, which is nothing new. Miners publishing a database update that other miners don't like could have it rejected, PoW or not. You could call this PoW-less database a blockchain if you want to, but Satoshi wouldn't.
 &gt; There aren't enough computing power in the world to roll back the blockchain, change a transaction, and roll it up again as long as the miners keep adding to it.
But you don't need to do that according to the other assertions you've made. The much easier thing to do would be to make a hardfork that just moves coins into addresses where you'd rather have them, or just produces coins out of thin air. Since you've suggested that the most-work chain (as measured in SHA-256 hashing power, I guess) is the valid chain, regardless of what rules it follows, colluding miners could create a most-work chain with the new rule that all the Satoshi coins now belong to them. They didn't need to rewrite the blockchain, they just changed the rules--which you said that they can do at any time, and no one can stop them.
 &gt; If you have trust in one entity you have a bank. Banks work just fine but they are not bitcoin.
Agreed, which is why I run a node that ensures that all transactions that I see on the network are valid. That way I don't have to trust anyone--not even a majority of miners can tell lie to me about what my or anyone else's balances are, because the rules defined by the software give a fairly strong guarantee that I can't be tricked. A system where miners (or any subset of users, exchanges, or developers for that matter) can arbitrarily change the rules is not very interesting--and is not how Bitcoin works.
 &gt; We don't trust miners. 
You're right, we don't. What I'm suggesting is that we don't because we can check to make sure that they aren't cheating, because it's possible to run nodes that validate that they aren't breaking the rules. But you are asserting that miners can change the rules if they want regardless and that we will follow them. If this is true, then we are implicitly trusting miners, and if that's the case, you could design a far more efficient payment system than Bitcoin.
The blockchain is an expense. It's a pain to pass around and validate, costs a lot to secure, and we wouldn't use one if we didn't have to. But using a blockchain allows every user to ensure that every other user is following the rules of the system and creates an incentives structure that makes it both difficult and largely unrewarding to try and steal other people's money (well, outside of running ponzi scams, which blockchains excel at). The Bitcoin blockchain has become far more cumbersome than it was in the early days, and mining has centralized in a very big way compared to how Satoshi originally predicted, but the process and requirement of every node in the network needing to come to consensus on a shared set of rules in order to participate in it has not changed. You even agreed that miners would want to get the community to agree with any intended fork as to not lose money, so you already know that if they just fork off on their own, they will be mining on an invalid--and thus worthless--chain. Why? Because Bitcoin is built on a consensus system, and no subset of users--be they a group of miners, a development team, a government, a subreddit, or any other set of users--has the ability to unilaterally fork the chain to a different set of rules.

I also would do this to consolidate small inputs together (generally so I would be able to send them as 0-fee transactions later because of priority).

Whoa, somehow you managed to flip nodes and miners in every instance. All users need to run behind a node in one way or another, whether they run it themselves or they outsource running it to another party. If exchanges, merchants, payment processors, and wallet providers all decide that they are going to run Bitcoin Core compatible node software, then everyone transacting with them or using their software will only recognize chains that are compatible with that software. Miners can run around on forks all they like, but they won't be able to interact with anyone else if they're running on rules that no one else agrees to.

It does fix malleability for them, makes block validation a bit faster by fixing N² sigops scaling (matters a lot less with their volumes, but still), and make it easier to implement LN in the way that it's currently being designed (which assumes segwit). Even though they definitely don't need the extra capacity, LN could still be of benefit for allowing instant payments that are actually secure.
It probably won't matter too much for them, but Litecoin with segwit will be objectively better than Litecoin without segwit--the same would also hold for Bitcoin, of course.

But exchanges *are* "nodekeepers". The people they service, buyers and sellers, are also either directly or indirectly running nodes. Unless everyone is running compatible software, they can't interact with one another. If any group unilaterally changes their software such that it's incompatible, they will not be able to interact with the rest of the ecosystem, but everyone else will still be able to communicate just fine.
If miners really are in charge of Bitcoin, maybe we should just fork Bitcoin to a SQL database. Mining pools could just pass a list around between one another and agree on it every ten minutes (or every minute, whatever) and pay themselves for a job well done. It would save all the trouble and expense of maintaining a blockchain, and it would be far more scalable.

Every time scaling is discussed, it comes down to the same talking points and the same rebuttals having to be made over, and over, and over again. Segwit is easily the best proposal we have at the moment, and some of its fixes (particularly fixing the quadratic sigops hashing issue) are necessary before we can even think about things like raising the blocksize. It also changes what is possible on the network so dramatically--by allowing future developments like signature aggregation and MAST, as well as enabling current implementations of LN--that we can't predict very well what network usage will look like post-segwit. That uncertainty makes it difficult to plan ahead. Lukejr's working on a hardfork proposal that might be useful in the future if we see the need for more capacity after segwit, but everything about it is tentative, as it should be.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:25:58
Bear in mind that that exact transaction number won't actually happen in practice due to real-world transaction mixes. The current limit could do a bit over 4000 tx in a block if they were all simple 1-input 2-output transactions, but this isn't the case. Segwit will, however, increase capacity something like 1.7-2.1 times once in use, and more importantly, it facilitates further developments that could more radically increase the capacity of the network.

@_date: 2017-03-17 17:33:21
1) I believe you are correct on this. My understanding is that the transition to P2PKH is intended once segwit is activated and is understood and used by the vast majority of the network (95%). I could be wrong on this, but do not think that it will be a long-term problem, and the minor short-term drawbacks are made up for by the much smoother roll-out this allows. But even if it just stayed as nested P2SH, it's still a big improvement because of the other benefits segwit provides.
2) I don't think that these spam blocks would be nearly as harmful as you suggest. At worst, these blocks would increase the bandwidth and storage space required for the period that the spammer is able to keep up the attack, which would require outbidding all other transactions on the network. The long-term effects of such an attack would, however, be negligible. Because these blocks would contain a disproportionate amount of signature data compared to normal, they would actually cause *less* UTXO bloat than normal transactions--an important long term concern. Additionally, segwit removes attack vectors based on the quadratic hashing problem at any blocksize by actually making sigops hashing scale linearly.
Then of course there's the stuff being built on top of segwit (aggregation, MAST, second layer), which are clearly positive for scaling.

Segwit definitely does increase the load in nodes in some respects, though could also decrease it in at least one important way. The increased capacity will absolutely increase the storage and bandwidth requirements in pretty much the same way as a straight blocksize increase would. UTXO set growth will likely increase as well, though hopefully less than it would with a straight blocksize increase due to the changed costing making it less expensive to spend UTXOs than it is to create them. The biggest way that it reduces load on nodes (to my understanding) is that segwit fixes the quadratic sigops hashing issue for segwit transactions. This means that the average amount of CPU time needed to validate transactions will go down significantly, and the attack vector that abuses quadratic hashing will no longer work with segwit transactions and could at worst be used the same way it can today. With the current limits, we've seen blocks that took ~25 seconds for regular consumer hardware to validate--at 2MB non-segwit blocks, this could go over 10 minutes.
No one can really know the exact effect on node centralization that this will have, though this is probably a good reason to start off with a modest (doubling!) increase before pushing things further. Segwit brings with it a large number of very helpful improvements to Bitcoin, as well as a chance to observe the effects of a blocksize increase to help gauge the viability (and necessity) of future increases.

I think this comes from a study that only looked at some factors (mostly bandwidth). Past 4MB was where greater than 10% of nodes would be unable to keep up with the network (which would also mean that initial sync would be basically impossible for nodes just barely able to keep up). The study didn't consider some other important factors, like dealing with attacks that abuse the quadratic sigops hashing problem, which even at 2MB could create blocks that take more than 10 minutes for normal consumer hardware to validate.

Excuse me, but users have a voice too; they get to decide when to remotely shut down everyone's nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:34:26
But the transactions that they send and receive can't use segwit, so they don't have to worry about being defrauded. It wouldn't hurt to upgrade so they could understand those, but not upgrading won't cause a loss of funds.
EDIT: My bad, I guess in the case of using a segwit input, old nodes wouldn't understand the signature and thus need to rely on miner confirmations. Default action for nodes would be to not display the incoming transaction until it has confirmations (because it is non-standard). In the strict sense, this would be a reduction in security, though the 95% miner support requirement for segwit activation is intended to mitigate this risk.

Technically no. Softforks restrict the ruleset, whereas hardforks change the rules in a backwards incompatible way. Restricting mining to *only* segwit signalling blocks is a softfork as these blocks are still valid before the fork, whereas invalidating the mining of segwit signalling blocks would be a hardfork.
Of course, it's still a very aggressive action to take.

Sure. The last transaction I made I waited almost 5 days (I paid a feerate of 10 sats/byte)--40 mins would be plenty fast enough in many cases. And if the result is that you also set up a payment channel for LN, from then on you'll be able to transact cheaply and instantly.

Sorry, I meant to the numbers he's seeing, not the ones that you're reporting.

@_date: 2017-03-03 17:33:34


The problem is that they *can't* create a fee-floor for the reason that you stated: other miners will mine transactions below their fee floor. All setting a fee floor will do is reduce their own profits compared to the competition--it's against their own self-interest unless they completely cartel and orphan everyone who includes transactions below their fee floor.


To the extent that they act in their own self-interest--which may involve centralizing to increase their own profits. Whether or not they feel that staying decentralized is in the interest of future profits is a crapshoot--maybe they see the value, or maybe their own immediate profits are more important (or maybe they like centralization and think it will help Bitcoin be more efficient).


I agree with this, but do you think miners are able to or should be required to make these measurements? To my knowledge, Bitfury is the only mining pool to put in the effort to even do a study on the effect of larger blocksizes--everyone else seems to be riding by the seat of their pants.


Not if you control (or are part of a pool) with majority hashpower (or even as much as a third)--in these cases, it's *everyone else's* orphan rates that go up. Basically it leads to selfish mining without really trying, since it takes longer for your block to propagate to the network (and others to propagate to you). Thus, you'll end up spending more time building on top of your own chain, and if a new block is unable to propagate to your pool before you find another block on top of it, the competition's block will be orphaned (since your chain is now longer). Even if not done with malicious intent, this would be a centralization pressure simply due to technological limitations. Potential pre-consensus schemes could alleviate these issues, but they need to be developed first.
I think it's fair to assume that miners will attempt to act in their own self-interest, but it's a stretch to assume that they will do what is best for the network in the long run. Already they do things like validationless mining, which could lead to dangerous accidental forks if miners end up building on top of invalid blocks (that they didn't validate), and some have chosen to run alternative software that would sometimes just produce invalid blocks. How many Bitcoin developers have mining pools employed? Miners now are very good at building efficient ASIC farms at large scale, which is a great specialization, but network health does not seem to be one of their larger concerns (though it should be, for everyone's sake).

Thinking about it a little, does this open up an attack vector against miners running BU?

If so, wouldn't all non-BU nodes ban them upon receiving these invalid blocks? Does this create a real concern for partitioning the network?

It was absolutely intentional! Since segwit uses the new variable MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT for determining the limits for what can go in a block, it could be set to any arbitrary value. 4 million made up of 3x the TX size and 1x the witness size was decided upon as an appropriate compromise between increasing capacity and balancing the costs on the network. This could have been 8 million with a different balance or 1 million (no capacity change) or whatever else.


Signature aggregation combined with coinjoin (and Tumblebit) are a starter here for both capacity and privacy. Lukejr has been working on hardforks that also include eventual blocksize increases, but as you're probably aware, he's very conservative about preserving the network. "Core" hasn't really found anything aside from segwit that they are able to get consensus for amongst developers and a lot of them seem to want to gather more data about how things look after segwit goes live and second layer solutions start rolling out on top of it.

[Is this the post you are referring to?]( This post seems to assume that:
a) Even if there is block space to spare, all miners will collude and essentially leave money on the table, and *no one* will go against the cartel and include as many of the lower paying transactions as possible (which someone almost certainly will absent full-out orphaning of miners not in the cartel).
b) The mining cartel does not act maliciously and intentionally bloat block sizes to levels that encourage centralization (as miners either join the cartel or suffer increased orphan rates).
Relying on miners colluding and playing nice with one another to retain any semblance of decentralization does not seem like a very good security model. And if we're happy with a centralized miner cartel that gets to decide what transactions get through and what it wants to censor, then why do we need a blockchain at all?

Empty blocks now are generally the result of spy-mining: the practice of mining on top of another block's header before the verification of that block is done. Since verification isn't done, the miner can't know what transactions were included, so the safest way to create a valid block is to include no transactions. Of course, this practice creates security concerns, but that doesn't seem to stop miners from doing it. Requiring that blocks include other transactions wouldn't really help either, as miners could just make a bunch of transactions themselves to fill a block with as many valid transactions as they want to at zero cost.

His wording could have been better, but the point stands that it matters very little to un-upgraded software whether segwit is in effect or not. Older software will continue to operate just as it always has, and it will continue to understand 100% of all transactions it makes and receives, as well as be able to validate that the currency supply isn't being inflated. It won't understand some of the new things going on in other transactions that it is uninvolved with, but that won't affect its own operations.

Feerate will always be directly connected to resource utilization on the network--it's the only way that makes sense for miners. Since block space is a limited resource, miners are incentivized to select transactions which will provide the largest fee within the available block space. Given this property, a percent-based system simply does not work.
Simple example:
There is enough space for one transaction in the block. Tx1 is transacting 1 Bitcoin and paying a 10% fee (0.1BTC). Tx2 is transacting 100 Bitcoins and paying a 1% fee (1BTC). Which does the miner choose to include in the block? Of course, it's the 100BTC transaction, because that's what gives the most fees given the constraints.
You can tell miners, "please include transactions with the highest fee percentages," but the incentives to have the highest feerate/KB stay the same as they are now.

Innovations like signature aggregation and Tumblebit on the other hand could improve privacy while also improving scaling. Both are kind of stuck waiting on segwit at the moment though (at least for the optimal form in the case of Tumblebit), but maybe one day.

They probably can't give a "when" for this (with segwit and LN rolled out, no one knows what Bitcoin usage will actually look like), but individual devs could probably come up with reasons/conditions where (outside of the segwit softfork, which they have already agreed is acceptable) they might consider a blocksize increase useful or feasible and how they would want to see it implemented. Though even so, these would have to be opinions from them as individuals (since Core has no leader) and nothing they say could be all that binding since no one knows how things might develop in the future. Maybe you think things are going one way, then Lord Voldemort drops off a whitepaper and suddenly there's something you could do that completely changes your approach.
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:15:14
If you aren't going to invest the time into understanding it, then this is probably a good approach. Bitcoin probably doesn't serve any of your needs at the moment, so there's no need to dive in without understanding. If it ever develops to the point where it does serve your needs, then you probably won't need to understand it, because it will have reached the point where it "just works".

Weight is calculated as the witness data + 4x the transaction data, which together has to come in under the new weight limit of 4 million. Theoretically speaking, this means that a block could be at most 4MB if it was all witness data, or 1MB if it was all transaction data (though these sorts of blocks couldn't exist). I'm not sure why 4 million was decided upon as the appropriate limit, but my guess would be that it's to limit the possible increase in bandwidth/storage costs that will come with the increased blocksize.
Segwit is able to function as a softfork because segwit blocks, though larger than 1MB, can have their witness data stripped to create blocks containing only transaction data, which can be passed to lite clients (that don't need to see witness data) or old nodes (which will accept them as the blocksize for the stripped block will be under 1MB, but they will know something that they don't understand is going on with the signatures so they won't relay or mine segwit transactions).
EDIT: There's tons of good segwit information throughout [this thread]( I certainly learned a lot from it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:28:43
The thought occurs to run a little thought experiment about paying for the security of the network. What do TX fees need to be to secure the network?
Say we take the current block reward of 12.5BTC. What would that look like in fees? Well, at $900 per coin, that's $11250 per block. Say we're making all simple 1-input 2-output transactions--we'll fit about 4000 of these in a block. $11250 / 4000 nets us $2.81 for a basic transaction to achieve the same amount in fees that we currently get from the block subsidy. You can adjust these numbers to find a number of things. Like, say you want to make 5 cent transactions yet still pay the same total subsidy--this would require **56.25MB** blocks.
What's the point of this? I guess it's to say that using Bitcoin is *expensive*. If we want Bitcoin to stay at least as secure as it is now as the mining subsidy decreases, then transaction fees are going to go up, or the costs on nodes are going to go up (probably a combination of both). Realistically, if we want cheap transactions on a decentralized Bitcoin, we're going to have to rely on higher layers for most of the volume with higher fees for on-chain settlement.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:40:01
He was saying that at fees of zero (or sufficiently low enough that you're willing to pay them), people could use the Bitcoin network for any number of weird, bloaty things. Want to upload your favorite movie to the blockchain? At a low enough price, why not? How about backing up data? If Bitcoin were cheaper than normal cloud storage, then it could be a great option for highly replicated backups of non-sensitive data. This would all be fine if block space was free, but everything that needs to be stored in the Bitcoin blockchain is an expense for all nodes in the system--and generally an uncompensated one, at that.

The cost of transactions is based on the demand on the system compared to its capacity; transactions that make it into a block have to outbid transactions that don't. "Size" and "weight" distinctions are irrelevant; capacity is what matters. If 2MB blocks would allow 8000 transactions and segwit costing changes would allow 8000 transactions, then either way you are competing against the same number of transactions for block space. With segwit the costing will be different so different transactions will have different costs relative to one another, but at the same level of capacity and demand, total fees should be the same.

Signaling is done through setting the version bits in blocks that a miner mines to the value corresponding to segwit activation. You might think of it kind of like miners casting their vote every time they find a block. Miners could change clients to cast different "votes" in different blocks they find if they really wanted to for some insane reason, but there is no way aside from orphaning blocks for a block that signals segwit to change what it signals once included in the blockchain.

even they maintained the equivalent of full node security so long as they were

there is to date no viable theory on how it might be fixed. As a result, the 
only way for nodes to have full-node-security is to actually be a true full 
node, and therefore the plan of only having full nodes in datacenters is 
simply not realistic without transforming Bitcoin into a centralised system.

Ignoring that common requests for 2MB blocks + segwit don't make sense (as you pointed out), the other big reason asking for segwit + some other blocksize change gets pushback is that it would require a hardfork. Some of "Group A" would probably be okay with a blocksize increase beyond what segwit offers, but the only softfork option we have available at the moment is segwit.

I don't know the numbers, but what you're missing is the benefit of using CoinJoin alongside signature aggregation--that is, the ability to sign an arbitrary number of inputs with a single signature, rather than requiring a signature for every input. The more inputs a transaction contains, the more space signature aggregation will save, which is what makes it especially beneficial for CoinJoin.

The problem in the example given was that her 10 cent transaction was taking forever to confirm--presumably she would be willing to pay more than 10 cents in order for it to go through faster, but without accessible ways to make use of RBF it's hard to bump a transaction's fee rate once you've made it.
The fees last week were not due to a spike in transaction volume, but likely the result of someone manipulating fee estimates such that software was reporting very high fee requirements for "one block confirmations" when the reality was these transactions were paying over 30x the fees they needed to.

@_date: 2016-12-20 04:07:29
I think this accusation comes from people assuming that LN will primarily involve routing through large "hubs", which would be centralized points of weakness. Earlier conceptions of payment channels in Bitcoin did reference "hub and spoke" models, but current developments in LN are aiming for a flatter sort of network as described in Q15 in the OP. There do seem to be some incentives towards creating larger nodes (less hops might mean less fees), though there might also be some disincentives (LN involves tying up funds in essentially a hot wallet, so large nodes might make themselves bigger targets for attack), but it seems like there should be enough ways to connect to other users that censorship would be difficult.
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:00:40
Unfortunately, it still seems to be a fairly common misconception that segwit somehow allows you to cram "more in less". There was even that pretty infographic that suggested this is the case. Future developments such as signature aggregation and LN could definitely work as "more in less" capacity increases, but segwit itself is a "more in more" sort of increase.

Which we should expect, really; I mean, it's all I've ever really cared about mining shitcoins. The system is built such that miners are rewarded for processing transactions, and this is their sole role in the ecosystem (do work, collect pay). As an extension of this, it shouldn't be surprising that they are willing to jump at opportunities to increase their own power, but non-mining users should be resisting their attempts to do so, which is trivially easy to do--just don't run software that will see their power grabs as valid.

It was removed because miners could (and many did) stop including transactions based on priority in order to use that space instead for fee-paying transactions. Getting rid of the expectation that there would always be space for free transactions also made it possible to have nodes limit the transactions they keep in their mempools to a static size by discarding low-fee transactions when the node's limit is hit, placing a bound on the maximum memory that is required by the mempool. This makes it possible for nodes to safely allocate the resources they have available and protects against DoS attacks which could result from some party spamming the network with low or no fee transactions and crashing nodes that can't handle the mempool load.

It could be switching to an alt with different supply, or it could be a hard fork that maintains the same supply (which is technically making an alt, I guess). Either way, miners have no say in the matter. If the new chain uses the same proof of work algorithm, miners would switch to the new chain if they want to keep making a profit, because that's where the value has gone. If the new chain switched the PoW, it would effectively "fire" the miners, since their hardware wouldn't work anymore.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:26:05
If they fork off without consensus, they'll either split the userbase if there is enough support for their fork, or they'll find themselves mining a worthless altcoin if there is not. IMO, the most honest thing the pro-hard fork camp could do at this point is design a fork that would be incompatible with the existing chain and just fork off now. If people like their new chain, maybe it'll gain value and even surpass Bitcoin--if not, then at least they got to run their little experiment without breaking what we have now.

All nodes running Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 or higher should understand opt-in RBF, which includes the majority of nodes in operation today, so the idea is hardly new. Really what you're asking miners to offer is a private double-spend service, rather than just handling it publicly as is done with RBF, which seems unnecessary in light of the fact that opt-in RBF is already available today.

Segwit changes some of the things spammers can do, but does not really increase the damage they can do overall. An important thing to remember is that to have a block filled with the sorts of transactions that would create these 3.7MB blocks, the spammer would have to outbid *every other fee paying transaction*--they would be paying more than all the highest paying transactions combined. The segwit "discount" is only a discount in the number of bytes/feerate you get--it will not make it any cheaper to push every other transaction out of a block, except indirectly by potentially lowering fees in general due to the increased capacity.
This giant block spam is also a bit different than currently possible spam, and I would argue much less harmful than would be possible with straight "2MB blocks". What it will use more of is bandwidth and storage (for full archival nodes). The attacker can keep these costs up a bit as long as he can continue to fund the attack by outbidding everyone else, and there will be *some* long term storage costs because of this (probably not much in the grand scheme of things). However, some things about this attack will be much less dangerous than what could happen in a 2MB non-segwit blocks scenario. The segwit attack intentionally involves a much smaller number of transactions as to create more witness data, which results in less bloating of the UTXO set, which is an important long-term concern. Perhaps more importantly, segwit fixes the quadratic signature hashing problem, which with 2MB blocks would allow the construction of malicious blocks that could take *over an hour* for modern consumer hardware to validate. BIP109 (a 2MB proposal) added some sigops limitations to prevent problems this severe, but it is worth noting that there is no longer any implementation of Bitcoin which includes the sigops protection in BIP109.
So yes, attackers can outbid all other transactions in order to flood the network with big blocks for a while, but neither the short term nor long term consequences of this will be all that severe; especially compared to the harm which could be done under different capacity increase proposals.

This might be helpful, as these issues do pop up time and time again, and the sooner we learn to handle the fee market properly, the better. Bitcoin is designed such that fees will eventually be necessary to secure the network, and we have the opportunity now to learn how to make Bitcoin work in the context of a fee market. Part of it is user-side--making a best effort to send transactions with appropriate fees for their urgency--and part of it is wallet-side, where wallet devs should be building ways to resolve fee-related issues, such as by providing better fee estimates and by implementing support for RBF and CPFP "fee-bumping" for instances where confirmations are taking longer than desired.

I don't know about good resources, but here's a terrible resource: 
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:09:36
Another important aspect to consider with larger blocks is that in Bitcoin as it is (and in all alternative, larger-block supporting implementations), the time (CPU processing power) required to validate blocks increases quadratically with the number of signature operations. On the current network, we have seen blocks that take ~20 seconds to validate--with even 2MB blocks, attackers could potentially build blocks that take over an hour for modern consumer hardware to validate. Segwit, on the other hand, fixes sigops validation such that it scales linearly, so this sort of attack is no longer possible.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:42:30
You must be combining a fairly large number of inputs in that transaction--the most I can get "normal" to cost for my full Mycelium balance of roughly 1.5BTC is 61 cents, and that's drawing from 9 inputs. I'm not 100% on this, but I think that the costing changes in segwit are favorable towards transactions like this that have many inputs but few outputs.
On another note, it's probably best to use "high priority" sparingly. I feel like an idiot shilling my own post repeatedly, but there was a point a week ago where [it seemed like fee estimates were being manipulated]( to make various software give excessively high estimates for one-block confirmation.

There seems to be something funny about fee estimations right now across multiple implementations for high priority transactions. Just cooking up a transaction with Mycelium is suggesting a "Normal" fee of 10 cents, but a "Priority" fee of $2.42! Bitcoin Core suggests a rate of ~63 sats/byte for a transaction to confirm in the next two blocks, but a fee of 1102 sats/byte for next block confirmation! No idea what's actually going on here, but it doesn't seem to be exclusively a Mycelium issue.
EDIT: Though if you look at that [bitcoinfees]( website, there have been a very large number of very high fee transactions today for some reason. This seems like it is almost certainly due to wallet software suggesting fees like this (even though they are completely unnecessary), which probably feeds back into the fee calculation and perpetuates the problem.
@_date: 2016-11-29 04:18:24
Segwit alone does not itself fix the problem, but it is necessary in order to fix it. [Here's an old BCT post by gmaxwell on this]( Old style transactions will still have the problem, but it will not get any worse than it is now since the limits for these do not change.

@_date: 2017-01-30 01:33:00


Probably a lot worse than that; if we actually wanted to include one of these in the blockchain (rather than orphaning it), nodes would just end up stuck forever trying to validate the damn thing.
@_date: 2016-11-07 09:58:58
Sorry, I don't mean any disrespect, but that's kind of hilarious. Realistically, there's no need at all to send with high fees like that; even the "normal" fee should confirm in the next block since transaction volume is actually rather low at the moment, and "normal" should also be something like 30x cheaper than "priority" judging from the numbers Mycelium is giving me.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:01:44
Have you heard of the quadratic signature validation problem? Malicious 2MB blocks could be designed to take over an hour for consumer hardware to validate. Segwit fixes this problem. UTXO growth increases are also mitigated by segwit's costing versus a straightforward blocksize bump. And yes, segwit does make LN work better, and this will likely be a boon to *everyone*, giving us a new way to transact using Bitcoin instantly, cheaply, with scaling that is orders of magnitude better, while still remaining decentralized.
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:19:12
I often go quite a lot lower than the minimum Core suggests--last one was around 7 sats/byte--for transactions that just combine a bunch of inputs so I can spend them at higher priority later. If you're not in a rush, there is plenty of cheap space in low-volume periods.

I'm not really concerned with whether or not they think these uses are good or not because I'm not trying to push them to buy Bitcoin; I just bring them up because I find them interesting. Of course, I also find it very interesting that demand for magic internet drug money seems to keep pushing up the price.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:54:58
I agree that the capacity increase that comes with segwit is not enough to be considered a robust scaling solution, and it was not my intention to convince anyone of this. I merely wanted to point out that the idea of "2 mb block and segwit" seems to suggest that segwit itself does not include a blocksize increase. Blocksize as an independent parameter also doesn't really make sense with segwit, since max block size is being replaced with max block weight.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:03:03
Why do neither this or the article it's responding to view the blocksize as a technical problem? Bitcoin transactions demand a variety of resources from nodes, including disk storage, bandwidth, RAM, and CPU processing power, and increasing blocksize increases the demands on all these things (in an especially dramatic way for CPU time without segwit). [A study of the issue]( has shown that ~4MB blocks is the highest Bitcoin could go without kicking ~10% of existing nodes off the network outright just because of network propagation times (and these nodes would just barely be able to keep up--catching up would likely be impossible). Thanks to the N² signature hashing problem (which is fixed with segwit), even 2MB blocks open Bitcoin up to attacks that could leave nodes stuck verifying single blocks for over an hour. UTXO set growth is also a big concern long-term--the more it grows, the more nodes need to cache in RAM to attempt to remain operational. Larger blocks increase the rate at which this set can grow, and the current costing structure generally makes it undesirable to combine multiple inputs to "clean up" the UTXO set. Segwit addresses UTXO concerns through its new costing, which makes inputs significantly cheaper than outputs.
As far as I can tell, Core is not opposing big blocks because of some desire to centrally control the fee market, but because *they don't want the Bitcoin network to crash and burn*. Without many of their previous improvements to Bitcoin (like libsecp256k1 speeding up verification 7-fold or whatever it was), the network would already be exploding. You can argue about the economics all you want, but if the underlying software is broken, then Bitcoin doesn't just not work well--it doesn't work at all.

And their suggestions were never good enough to pass peer review. For a while, Gavin was urgently pushing for 20MB blocks--upon testing long after the fact, he found that this would be completely unreasonable and clawed back all the way to 2MB. Now, 2MB blocks itself probably would be *okay* with some sigops protections, but worth a hardfork just for that? Probably not. Now we have segwit on the table, which pretty much does the blocksize increase that would've come from BIP109, but fixes the quadratic hashing problem as well, in addition to all its other benefits, and can be implemented in a softfork.

It does seem like a lower chance of acceptance might be more reasonable given the crazy estimates we're getting from how it works currently--then again, it's probably better in general to just use the 2-block estimate, which realistically will likely see your transaction included in the next block, though is no big loss if it takes one more.

This question doesn't really make sense. Segwit replaces MAX_BLOCK_SIZE with MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT for the purpose of limiting the number of transactions that can be included in a block.

@_date: 2016-11-07 00:14:06
TL;DR There are a large number of extremely high fee (over 1000 sats/byte) transactions being made despite there being low transaction volume. It is possible that someone is manipulating fee estimates, as the number of transactions paying these rates seems to immediately refill to around 40-60 after blocks are found.

This guy is getting a little too high on his perception of miner power in the system. Miners act as something like employees of Bitcoin--they provide security for the system and help by ordering transactions, and for doing so they are paid for their work. We hope that miners and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem can get along, but if miners are perceived to be acting against the will of the users of the system, miners can be "fired" through a hard fork that changes the PoW, and they have no input on this. It's inconvenient for everyone if this has to happen, but it's always a possibility, and there's nothing miners can do to stop it.
Funny though how he's so against soft forks--where miners *do* have input--and in support of hard forks, where he's just lucky if the chain decides to fork to something his hardware is compatible with. Though I guess as a LTC pool operator, he has benefited from hard forks in the past ;)
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:17:37


They can't really *change* the rules, since all nodes on the network are validating independently. There are really nasty things that can be done with large amounts of hashpower (double-spends, orphaning other miners' blocks, etc...), but they can't make arbitrary changes to the system.

How do you make those fiat transactions? Are they all cash, or are you using debit/credit/paypal? If it's not cash, there are probably fees involved too--just that you're not the one paying them.
Though as an aside, centralized payment systems mop the floor with blockchains efficiency-wise anyhow. If Bitcoin has any intention of competing as a payment rail, it's going to need innovations like Lightning Network that can actually scale. As is, we're just lucky that fees are as low as they are for the time being.

Fortunately for Wright he likely owned at most trivial amounts of Bitcoin during that period, though his story is obviously something else.

The way segwit works, the blocksize *will* in fact be increased--by 70% if the current mix all used it, which is where the 70% capacity increase comes from.

Right, but this doesn't seem to be a simple instance of high volume -&gt; high fees. When I posted and was watching this yesterday, there was actually very low transaction volume. Paying &gt;61 sats/byte would easily put you within what would fit into the next block, yet wallet software was suggesting (and people were paying) fees over an order of magnitude higher than this. This is still ongoing, though estimates seem to be coming down a bit (though they are still far higher than necessary).

I have had an issue where I think the app closing improperly caused it to corrupt my pin so I couldn't access my wallet. Of course, deleting the wallet and restoring from the seed fixed this, but obviously it's not something you want happening. Another issue I noticed is that the last time I sent a segwit transaction the fees were calculated improperly. Even though it used segwit, fees were still done using sats/byte rather than sats/vbyte, so it ended up overpaying compared to the fee amount I told it to use.
That said I still love a lot of the features that Samourai offers and am really happy with the amount of development that seems to be going into it.

Current capacity is not equivalent to scalability. Very few people actually run fully archiving ethereum nodes because of how much resources it consumes and how long it takes to sync (and it seems on many systems it just can't sync at all, even after weeks). [The ethereum blockchain is already double the size of Bitcoin's]( and growing (also I don't know if the node collecting stats there crapped out recently or what--it's hard to find sources of data on the size of the eth chain to compare against). Then, as you said, ethereum transactions are more complex. This leads to more data that needs to be transferred, verified, stored, etc...

Yup, you got it. Effectively CT would work like segwit is working now; if more people use it, blocks will be larger. Assuming a lower weight is given to CT, that is--it's still very early in the discussion :)

Adding new signature types is one of the classic sorts of softforks--obviously segwit did it as a softfork, as did P2SH before it. Though now that we have segwit it would be done through segwit's script versioning rather than the old method of using NOP codes. I don't really know how it works at a low level, [but this page explains it in brief in the "Future upgrades made easier by segwit" section]( The new signatures would end up being part of the witness data like what we have now, so they also wouldn't be served to legacy (pre-segwit) nodes, thus preserving the 1MB blocksize limit for those nodes even if CT or whatever increases it further.

Indeed, and false signaling has been a problem in the past (miners signaling for things before actually updating to support them). This is part of why BIP9 was designed with a 95% support threshold--it was to create a stronger guarantee that even if some significant percentage of miners were falsely signaling that majority hashpower would still actually be updated.
Unfortunately that all went out the window when miners ended up maliciously withholding the upgrade even after the large majority of nodes had updated to support it.

@_date: 2017-11-16 20:55:48


He did explain it, though it was very brief--maybe you don't grasp how the weight limit works quite well enough right now to have understood it. What nullc said was:


Since [Bitcoin now uses weight exclusively]( blocksize is not explicitly limited as new signature types introduced do not need to be weighted the same way as existing signatures. Currently, segwit witness data is weighted at 1 weight unit per byte, whereas legacy transaction signatures are weighted at 4 weight units per byte. A block is only full when its weight hits 4 million. As such, you can pack more segwit signatures in a block than you can legacy signatures, which results in a larger block. As a simple (but non-realistic) example, if you had a block entirely comprised of witness data weighted at 1 weight unit per byte, you could get a 4MB block at the weight limit, while a block full of legacy transactions at 4 weight units per byte could only produce a 1MB block.
CT signatures would be just like segwit witness data, except they could be introduced with their own weighting. So, if for example they were given a weight of 0.5 weight per byte, a block made entirely of CT signatures (again, not realistic) could be 8MB in size without exceeding the 4 million weight limit.

It's not in the GUI yet, but you can use addwitnessaddress in the console to make segwit addresses manually, though they aren't handled 100% properly in other parts of the GUI. Probably would've had proper support in the last release if *something* hadn't changed the immediate priorities.

True, it is to their benefit for others to stop mining--less hashpower on Bitcoin means the difficulty will eventually correct downwards. Even if the other miners come back at some point, the difficulty adjustment will still benefit them when it happens. It also doesn't hurt a miner if their competition buggers off to mine something much less profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:29:29
You can do custom fees (sort of) in Mycelium now. It's weird because it's not precise, but it'll give you a slider that you can move around beyond just the default recommendations. The last time I used it was just to sweep some funds and I paid ~32 sats/byte. There were also options to pay 1 sat/byte, and even 0 sats/byte, if you really think the mempool is going to clear out completely.
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:32:29
I think he's using "favorite" ironically here because he understands how dumb an idea it is to try and push a blocksize hardfork through before segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:15:27
You are both correct; mining revenue (in the short-term) will not change if the difficulty remains static. However, wasn't saying the profitability will increase, but that remaining miners will be more likely to find the next block because the competition has left. Most obvious example would be if everyone but a single miner left: that miner would then have a 100% chance of finding the next block since there's no one else even looking, though the rate at which he finds blocks would remain unchanged.
Why this matters in the short-term? I don't know, it wasn't my point :P
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:34:24
How much have you had to pay in your transactions lately? I made two transactions yesterday using the Mycelium "normal" fee of ~10 cents, and both confirmed in the next block. The mempool in my node has once again dropped the minimum relay fee. I just got a next block confirmation on a transaction with a feerate of **7 sats/byte**.
Is this really a disaster?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:55:09


There's not really anything that can be done about that. It's essentially free to spin up a new coin, and so long as it has any amount of valuation, then boom, cheap transactions. It won't scale any better than Bitcoin if it gets big, but small coins will always get the benefit of essentially free transactions, if that's the only thing you care about.

By and large, any tech in other coins that looks "better" than Bitcoin comes with big trade-offs. Ethereum, for example, does allow a much greater variety of things to be done on the blockchain, but at *massive* costs to its scalability and security--see the recent Parity bug that caused the loss of some 300 million dollars worth of funds, or the always-classic DAO hack. Monero is a coin that accomplishes privacy in a way that Bitcoin as it is now simply cannot, but again, the trade-off is that its scalability is far worse than Bitcoin's, and we already see how hard scaling Bitcoin is.
Cryptocurrency in general is in its very early stages and needs a lot of work from a lot of intelligent people if it's to reach a point where it can be useful for a great number of things for a great number of people. The large majority of those intelligent people are working on Bitcoin, because that's where all the development action is.

It's not even really that; the idea of BIP9 is just that, so long as miners are able to enforce softfork rules, it doesn't matter at all how many other nodes actually choose to use them. If segwit was activated and only 5% of nodes supported and used it, it would still work perfectly fine so long as miners enforced segwit's new rules. Unfortunately, it seems to have unintentionally turned into a weird miner-voting mechanism that is preventing [the majority of nodes from using an upgrade that they understand](
Addressing some of ronohara's other points, that "Segwit is not great" article seems extremely confused about what segwit is. Segwit doesn't use extension blocks, and it uses forward-compatibility mechanisms built into Bitcoin so old nodes understand that they are missing something with the stripped blocks that they receive from segwit nodes (old nodes regard segwit transactions as non-standard and will not relay or make use of them until they see them included in a block). Segwit also involves less changes to the consensus code than any other scaling-related proposals, has been tested far more, and has not caught fire repeatedly, unlike some other, less-tested changes made in other node software. Flexible transactions is a much larger deviation from the existing Bitcoin transaction format, lacks peer review, lacks testing (not sure if an implementation even exists), requires a hardfork... it's just nowhere close to being ready, even were it desirable.

non-upgraded-to-uasf miners and nodes to continue as non-upgraded
Doing this would still require majority hashpower or near-ubiquitous deployment across nodes to not cause disruption, yes? Either miners need to enforce the rules of segwit such that an invalid chain (say one with tx's spending segwit outputs that they do not have proper witness data for) does not grow larger than the valid chain and create problems for non-upgraded nodes, or essentially all economically active nodes need to be able to enforce the rules and orphan the invalid blocks. Of course, this is exactly the same problem that segwit has already had to deal with using BIP9 activation, except that it's cutting out the miner threshold part.
That said, if this sort of thing was rolled out in a Core release, it *might* be able to see large support (90+% of nodes supporting it) within three major releases, so something like 1.5-2 years. My guesstimate for this is based on the observation that [~95% of Core nodes are running one of the previous three major releases]( Still, it strikes me as a difficult challenge--if it is hard for many to upgrade to software supporting such a proposal (say if Core does not include it by default) or if the issue remains contentious, adoption might never hit a satisfactory level for safe activation. Not that this isn't a problem we're already having, mind you.
Just my thoughts on this, as uninformed as they may be. Is there a way to make this sort of thing safer, or would we just have to set the date far in the future and hope that everyone gets upgraded by then?

Agreed, and this is a problem that we're faced with. In most cases you can just accept that someone else has different views on a subject and let it go, since it doesn't really affect anything if you continue to disagree. But when the positions are "I want segwit" and "I want EC", then agreeing to disagree means that neither party gets what they want because Bitcoin can only change if there is agreement.

@_date: 2017-04-29 18:19:56
Some appear to view Bitcoin's strong resistance to change (for better or worse) as a positive for its use-case as a store of value. I don't think that they oppose things being built on top of Bitcoin (such as Tumblebit), but believe that stability at the protocol level makes Bitcoin better at being "digital gold". Fees I think are largely irrelevant for them as they primarily hope for Bitcoin to be used as a long-term store of value or for large settlement amounts.
Personally, I really want to see segwit activated as it vastly expands Bitcoin's ability to be developed on top of, potentially bringing it to use-cases beyond the censorship-resistance it offers today--though this is already well worth paying a few dollars in fees for those who need it.

Segwit keeps all data (signatures and transaction data) in the same block; it's just logically reorganized so signature data is no longer used when calculating txids (which fixes malleability for segwit transactions). Segwit blocks will be larger than 1MB, but it is possible to strip the signature data off of segwit transactions to send stripped blocks to old nodes that are still valid (but considered non-standard). The blocks that old nodes will receive will be under 1MB because they will be stripped of the extra signature data, but segwit supporting nodes will get blocks that are larger than 1MB because they include everything.

Well sure, but segwit supporting nodes will always include the witness data because they need it to fully validate transactions; the blocks they receive, given enough demand for block space, will always be over 1MB in size. Nodes that do not validate can download stripped blocks that don't include the witness data, and stripped blocks will be given to old nodes that don't fully understand segwit transactions, but segwit supporting nodes [(which now comprise around 85% of the network)]( will simply receive larger blocks.

You have this backwards; segwit allows for innovations in both the Bitcoin protocol itself and on higher layers that dramatically increase the system's scalability--larger blocks do nothing to make Bitcoin scale any more efficiently. Segwit offers the potential for increasing transaction capacity by orders of magnitude compared to what we have now, even at just the ~2MB blocksize, as well as increasing privacy--larger blocks just increase capacity linearly, with costs on the network increasing linearly or worse as well.
Besides, the blocksize limit can be increased post-segwit just fine... but why not start with observing an increase to ~2MB before deciding to push things even further?
@_date: 2018-11-07 07:45:26
[Probably referring to this thread]( Roger's business mistakenly sent too much to a guy as a refund (about $50 it seems) which the guy refused to pay back, claiming that he no longer had access to the address that the extra funds had been sent to. In response, Roger looked up the guy's bc.i account info using his admin access and then publicly doxed him for not paying back the ~$50. Whether the guy did or did not actually have access to the mis-sent funds, it was a massive abuse of power and huge shitshow for a small amount that ultimately was Roger's business's fault for sending out anyways.

Bcashers are bad at getting along with others, including each other, and are currently having a pissing contest to try to claim the title of the real fake Bitcoin. Part of this spat seems to be involving a hashing (mining) war, where Faketoshi has claimed that he's going to fuck everything up, and Jihan doesn't want to have all his shit fucked up. While this goes on, it's likely that some hashpower will be diverted from Bitcoin mining, making it take longer for blocks to be found and effectively reducing the capacity of the network until either the hashpower comes back or the mining difficulty adjusts. A small adjustment downwards should be coming soon, but it could take a few weeks to fully get back to normal if their pissing contest still isn't done.
As a side note, the real winners here are the honest Bitcoin miners, who will get to mine at reduced difficulty while the Bcashers burn money on their little spat.

As I understand it, the way it's designed now leans very heavily towards mixing to amounts larger than the minimum required to participate in a mix--practically speaking, regardless of what you put in, you should get back enough to participate again. This includes even if you put in the bare minimum required to participate, in which case you should end up getting back slightly *more* than what you put into the mix. This makes it easy to get additional privacy by tossing mixed coins back in, as well as letting you add to liquidity at no cost to you.

Visa *could* one day denominate your credit card balance or similar in Bitcoin, which you later pay off using Bitcoin that you control--though you still wouldn't be paying with *your* Bitcoin at the point-of-sale, rather you'd be spending Visa's Bitcoin (or other currency) instead at the time.
Prepaid stuff like this prepaid card (or even a bank account like normal debit cards use) does require giving up control of your Bitcoin though. Potentially it could be secured in tandem with another party using multisig (something like 2-of-3 where they control one key and you have a regular use key and a recovery key), but given that banks have been custodial services forever it's highly unlikely that they'd ever adopt such a model.

You've probably missed that the upcoming hardfork they're doing is contentious. From the looks of things, there's the Jihan and Roger side, and the Faketoshi side, both with their supporters (maybe even a no-fork side as well). In all likelihood, this will result in further fragmentation in their community, unless the "losing" sides cave and all settle on one chain. Given the precedent from the original Bcash fork, with Bitcoin continuing to dominate in every metric and the Bcash community persisting anyhow, a consolidation scenario seems pretty unlikely.

Schnorr won't really help to conceal that coinjoin transactions are coinjoins because it won't change the ability to see outputs, which are quite easy to identify as coinjoins.

The responses are people looking at the incentives of the situation and how the market functions. Objectively, there is profit to be made from purchasing the cards at the list price and re-selling them higher--a person is financially rewarded for doing so, and losing out if they do not. The morality of the act is subjective--many find it distasteful, yet the system makes the act financially rewarding, which encourages the behavior. People will tell the scalper to stop, but the incentives tell him to go--so go he does.
On another note, welcome to Bitcoin! Game theory is a big thing around here, as it's important to try to consider how people are actually going to act given the incentives around them, rather than just asking them to "do the right thing"--especially when money is involved.

It does a lot that affects Bitmain's profitability and patent practices. For starters, it opens up the possibility for any manufacturer to make use of the overt form of AsicBoost (this was previously locked behind a normal patent), which will increase hashes/watt efficiency for all hardware that makes use of it. The cost of using it, however, is that the manufacturer has to sign on to the Blockchain Defensive Patent License and make all their patents open for use by all others who do the same.
So for one, Bitmain's miners that do not use overt AsicBoost will be less efficient than newer hardware that does make use of it. Then, if Bitmain wants to make use of it, they need to open up their patents ([of which they seem to have many]( for others to use, giving up an advantage they've been trying to create.

AsicBoost doesn't increase the hashing speed of a miner, but will reduce the amount of electricity consumed, so you'll get more hashes/watt, thus saving on ongoing costs (and you can plug more miners into a smaller power source) if you use Slush's pool or any other supporting pool.

Assuming people keep trading it around and it stays distributed between different parties, it won't ever all be lost. If larger amounts are lost, people will just continue to trade whatever is remaining, probably in smaller amounts and at higher value due to increasing scarcity.

He's technically correct but 4MB blocks for actual usage are unrealistic for segwit alone. [Segwit has a limit of 4 million weight units]( rather than a specific blocksize cap. With the way weight is calculated for segwit, this allows up to around 4MB, but real transactions are more likely to hit around 1.7-2.5MB when all of them use segwit.

Not quite correct. Legacy nodes don't understand segwit's rules and updated nodes know that they don't, so instead the new nodes pass stripped blocks to the legacy nodes that have the witness data removed--legacy nodes will not receive blocks that contain witness data. This is why segwit blocks can be larger than 1MB yet never exceed the 1MB limit for older nodes; the older nodes will only receive blocks that have been cut down to a size that they understand as valid.
Though at this point trying to argue from the point of view of pre-segwit nodes is intentionally misdirecting anyways as roughly 90% of nodes on the network today understand and enforce segwit's rules.

A listening node is a node that has opened itself up for incoming connections (through port-forwarding). Generally you need to do this through your router, or perhaps your VPN. If you do not open a port for incoming connections, you will still be able to run a (non-listening) node and connect out to other nodes that do accept inbound connections (listening nodes), but others will be unable to initiate connections with you.
Listening nodes are obviously easier to connect to and count (though it's still a rough estimate regardless), but since non-listening nodes will still make outbound connections, you can still have them connect to you and attempt to count them. I don't know Luke's exact methodology for doing this, but you can see from his numbers that in fact [the majority of nodes are non-listening nodes, comprising something like 85-90% of nodes on the network](

Actually no, there is not an explicit 1MB limit any more. A bit before segwit was rolled out, the consensus code changed the limit from the old 1 million bytes to [the new metric of 4 million weight units](
"Weight" allows the assignment of different weight values to different data types. Right now, the only two categories are witness data (weighted at 1 weight unit per byte) and non-witness data (weighted at 4 weight units per byte). Before segwit's activation, weight was already in use, but since all data was "non-witness data", it was all weighted a 4 weight units per byte, thus effectively maintaining the old 1MB limit. Now that segwit is active, it's possible to fit more than 1MB of data in the 4 million weight limit.
The reason this did not cause a fork between segwit nodes and pre-segwit nodes [(of which there are not many left)]( is because segwit nodes are able to send "stripped" blocks and transactions to nodes that do not have segwit support. These blocks will not include the witness data needed to verify segwit transactions, which will bring the block size down below the old 1MB limit. Old nodes will see these stripped transactions as "non-standard", meaning they won't relay or mine them because they know that they aren't understanding something about them, but they will accept them once they see them included in a block. From the point of view of an old node, this does reduce your ability to validate segwit transactions, but again, over 98% of nodes appear to have upgraded at this point, so not many should be concerned with this. The end and intended result was just that people have been able to upgrade at their own pace without being forced off the network.

Sorry, but I don't quite understand the logic here. People who *can't* run a node, even if they wanted to? People in poor countries with limited access to internet and/or computers are unable to run nodes--is this a problem we need to consider? If I need X amount of bandwidth to do my daily activities and can't spare enough to run a node, does that mean that I *don't want* to run a node, or that I *can't* run a node?
Though honestly I don't think this definition matters because *no one* wants to run a node. It costs money to run a node. You need to spend bandwidth, power, storage space--and you aren't compensated for this in anything but warm fuzzy feelings (and security, in a sort of abstract way, I guess). People run nodes now because they're idiots like me and are willing to throw money at an ideology, but there's definitely a cut-off point there where even the dumbest of us will just switch the thing off. I don't know at what point that is generally--maybe it's when you can't watch Netflix any more--but it seems reasonable to think that if you put more strain on people's resources, more people will hit their charity cut-off point.

Crunchyroll already kind of markets itself like this already with anime, offering its service at a pretty low price point, and the convenience has definitely put a dent in the prevalence of fan-created alternatives compared to how things were in the 200X years. Maybe a torrent-based system could reduce the costs of services like this (probably by offloading some of the distribution work onto users), but I don't know if that would work better or worse than the centralized models that exist now.

They are not required to be as technically competent as devs, however.

His model definitely confuses me.

Bitcoin seems like it would probably be a hindrance as much as it is an enabler here, as this seems to rely on it being convenient to pay a small amount for downloads when it's actually rather inconvenient for most people to get Bitcoin in the first place.
If it did catch on, I could see myself offering downloads from megaupload as an option for some of the content I create, but it would essentially be a "donate by downloading" option, and alternative free options would also be available. In my opinion, it just seems like ill-will to try and pretend that you can force people to download from a particular source--if your content is at all desirable, someone is going to re-upload it somewhere more accessible if you don't yourself.

Agreed. The question is how much more we can push this before it starts impacting people's decisions to run a node or not. Segwit will use more; larger blocks would obviously use more. I don't know the answer here, but get the impression that approaching increases conservatively has a lot of merit.

The marginal risk involved in doing this is very, very small--the only difference is that they wouldn't be able to use compactblocks or something similar for block propagation for the transactions that other nodes don't have. You're allowed to include as many unseen transactions as you want in a block (provided they're valid), you'll just have to send them out with the block.


Well the cost to attempt is near zero, so a more malicious person might as well try ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


But RBF is just a node policy--one which miners can choose to act on regardless of what the "reference" client implements. If transaction replacement wasn't possible and everyone was able to agree on some kind of first-seen rule, we wouldn't even need blockchains in the first place!
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:52:46


You could also just send it straight to miners, who might practice RBF even if it isn't in the reference node software. Bitcoin miners were doing it before opt-in RBF made it into Core, and Bcash miners could continue doing it even with RBF not in the reference client.

They also have no transaction volume, no real-world usage, and no incentive to be attacked. They also explode fairly often, but you never hear about it because they are too small for anyone to care. Thanks to my hobby of shitcoin mining, I know from experience that a lot of altcoins have been unstable historically and like to fork all over the place from badly configured block times (or other things). The problem is common enough that mining switcher sites would create alerts for when a coin forks and they can't be sure that they're on the "main chain". It was common enough that it'd just be like "oh, Dimecoin went red again; that's a shame".

You can rebroadcast a transaction indefinitely until a conflicting transaction gets mined--even the receiver could do this. The receiver could also CPFP the payment (paying the fees themselves) if they are willing to pay the fees to do so.
EDIT: Third-party rebroadcasting was actually a huge pain without RBF if you had a transaction stuck at a low feerate and just wanted to do something else with it instead. Basically you had to just clear your own node's txes (requires a rescan) then make a new transaction and hope it got to a miner implementing RBF (these existed even before opt-in RBF was formalized) so you could effectively double-spend yourself. With a formalized method of doing RBF this is far easier to deal with, though with recent volumes stuck transactions haven't really been a problem.

This article (and a previous r/btc thread) makes a lot of reference to [this presentation]( which is an impressive amount of technical misinformation from an allegedly influential member of the Chinese Bitcoin community. I made a kind of big post about it in another thread when this came up, but I'm going to repost now that we have a thread directly about the topic.
[Start repost] Now, I can't read Chinese (Google's helping me out a bit here), but this Huang Shiliang fellow seems to be making a presentation that is dubious at best. [One of the slides]( seems to suggest that fees will stay at the same rate they are now, even with larger blocks, effectively just multiplying the miner fee income--it implies that at 1GB(!) blocks, miners would make 59000BTC in fee income daily, which is over 400BTC per block. Most people supporting capacity increases, regardless of their preferred method, are of the opinion that it will bring fees down for users (which is probably correct), so it's bizarre to see this being argued the other way. He also seems to express the Roger Ver logic of more capacity (which can only be gained from larger blocks, of course) = higher price, which seems to assume some there exists some flood of people just waiting to jump into Bitcoin if only it weren't for that pesky transaction limit! Also, datacenter coin seems to be his ideal, as he explicitly endorses that model.
Of course, the presentation seems to barely even consider the technical demands on the system created by "scaling" in this manner, seemingly assuming that an adequate number of datacenters will be able and willing to handle whatever gets thrown at them. It also seems to ignore the fact that the vast majority of Bitcoin "transactions"--such as those done within exchanges or within betting sites--are already handled off-chain, precisely because doing so actually works at scale, unlike Satoshi Dice's on-chain betting system.
I would hope that miners aren't deceived by a lot of this misinformation, but... 59000BTC valued at over $600000 each per day? It's mining paradise!

It doesn't. You can find [articles]( which claim that segwit makes more space by discarding signatures, but this is simply untrue--archiving nodes continue to store all transaction data, signature or otherwise, provided they support segwit (which [almost all do]( The most obvious way you can see this is just to look at blocks--if signatures are discarded, why do we get blocks that are larger than the previous limit of 1MB? The answer is that they aren't discarded.
*The caveat to this is that segwit has a feature of being able to strip witness data from transactions and blocks if desired or required by the receiver. The primary use of this was to remain compatible with old nodes that don't understand segwit, but could also be used with, say, light wallets, which might want to know about transactions, but don't generally care about the signatures of most transactions aside from the ones directly affecting their balance, though still care about transactions not inflating the coin supply (tx data without signatures is enough to check against inflation). At this point I don't think there are many nodes/wallets that use this feature though.

The potential for actually secure instant transactions strikes me as a huge feature.

That's an incorrect analysis of how segwit works; if segwit is only creating 1.7MB worth of transactions, then it will only create 1.7MB blocks--block sizes will vary depending on the sorts of transactions within them. The 4MB is the theoretical limit (the block cost limit) that a segwit block could reach if it was comprised entirely of witness data. This type of block would not be practical as it does not contain any transactions and would basically be spam--though spam that someone had to pay a competitive fee to get mined. Moreover, despite being "larger" at 4MB, such a block would consume less resources than a normal block (even in the current network) in some important ways. The most important of these is probably that it would not contribute to bloating the UTXO set, since it intentionally does not contain any transactions. It would also be pretty much entirely prunable, as once it has been verified, witness data can be discarded, since it does not need to be checked again unless you explicitly want to re-verify the blockchain, for some reason.

I always wonder about this one; while more capacity technically allows more users, I don't see how it incentivizes people to use Bitcoin in any interesting way. Capacity alone doesn't make it easier (or significantly cheaper, as service fees are the largest cost) to convert between fiat and Bitcoin. Capacity alone does not make confirmations take less than 10 minutes on average. Capacity alone does not let you use Bitcoin in your daily purchases in a way that is at all beneficial to the vast majority of people. If you tell John Smith on the street that Bitcoin's capacity has now quadrupled, he's not going to care, because Bitcoin probably doesn't serve his needs at its current capacity, and it won't serve them at a higher capacity either.

Okay, even if you think that downloading 6TB of blockchain a year is fine (I doubt anyone would actually want to run this even from this alone), how is validation going to be possible? The CPU requirements, especially for initial sync, would almost certainly be impossible. Right now it takes between hours and days to download and validate the whole ~125GB blockchain. A 6TB blockchain? Good luck. And what do you think the UTXO set would look like? Even if they somehow got past validation, do you want nodes to require 128GB of RAM to function?
Maybe in the future these numbers will be feasible, but as it stands, today they are nowhere near it.

[It was a link to an r/btc post about an "on-chain scaling" conference]( I went and wrote a big reply to it too, then when I hit save, I was alerted that the post had been deleted :/. I'm tagging my response below since apparently I can't respond directly any more.
[Originally responding to the now deleted comment] Now, I can't read Chinese (Google's helping me out a bit here), but this Huang Shiliang fellow seems to be making a presentation that is dubious at best. [One of the slides]( seems to suggest that fees will stay at the same rate they are now, even with larger blocks, effectively just multiplying the miner fee income--it implies that at 1GB(!) blocks, miners would make 59000BTC in fee income daily, which is over 400BTC per block. Most people supporting capacity increases, regardless of their preferred method, are of the opinion that it will bring fees down for users (which is probably correct), so it's bizarre to see this being argued the other way. He also seems to express the Roger Ver logic of more capacity (which can only be gained from larger blocks, of course) = higher price, which seems to assume some there exists some flood of people just waiting to jump into Bitcoin if only it weren't for that pesky transaction limit! Also, datacenter coin seems to be his ideal, as he explicitly endorses that model.
Of course, the presentation seems to barely even consider the technical demands on the system created by "scaling" in this manner, seemingly assuming that an adequate number of datacenters will be able and willing to handle whatever gets thrown at them. It also seems to ignore the fact that the vast majority of Bitcoin "transactions"--such as those done within exchanges or within betting sites--are already handled off-chain, precisely because doing so actually works at scale, unlike Satoshi Dice's on-chain betting system.
I would hope that miners aren't deceived by a lot of this misinformation, but... 59000BTC valued at over $600000 each per day? It's mining paradise!

[Peter Todd has made it happen]( That particular instance took advantage of discrepancies in the minimum fee that different miners were accepting, though this is not the only reason a miner might mine a double-spend.

@_date: 2018-04-29 23:04:22
Double-spends don't require replace-by-fee, but just that any miner wants to confirm a different (conflicting) transaction instead of the first one. If a miner wanted to confirm a double-spend with a lower fee instead of the first-seen transaction, there's nothing stopping them from doing that consensus-wise, just the economics of it. This is part of why RBF was not seen as controversial by developers--miners were already able to do it, so users might as well be able to specify that they want to allow replacement for their transactions before confirmation in a way that doesn't have most nodes reject the transactions. In the case of replacement/double-spending, having most nodes reject replacements based on a first-seen rule risks messing up propagation and could make replacement transactions invisible to most of the network aside from mining nodes which are configured to look for profitable replacement transactions.

They also might not be healthy for the world if they do more to enable negative activities than they are able to promote positive ones. It's possible that the harm done by things such as assisting money laundering for harmful activities (like helping terrorists buy weapons) or enabling wider use of ransomware software will outweigh the benefits to personal freedom in a general sense. On the other hand, maybe the enabling of these activities will change the way we have to approach some of these issues (like considering what it takes to stop people from wanting to be terrorists to begin with) which will ultimately result in deeper solutions to these problems.
The technology will be used by those who need it most, and we're not sure exactly who those are at the moment (a lot right now seem to be the underserved in regulated markets--like recreational drug usage and prostitution), and the jury's still out on whether the ways in which it will be used will be of benefit to society or not.

Except RBF is just a node-policy--it's not a consensus rule.

Let the guy drive off in his new car that he just paid you for at zero confs, seems fine.
But what that guy didn't tell you is that he also sent a different transaction that double-spends the coins--with a much higher fee--directly to Bitmain. Bitmain doesn't bother propogating this nice juicy transaction (it conflicts with other nodes' first-seen rule anyways so why bother?), but they happily confirm it because hey, it pays them more. Hello double-spend, goodbye money.

Not exactly, but it does apply social pressure.

Replay is a different issue. I'll try to give a more concrete example.
Say BTU miners decide at some point that they want to fork to a big blocks chain. Maybe they get 60% of miners to agree and start building a chain using the BTU rules, with 2MB blocks or something. With 60% hashpower, they are (probably) able to consistently maintain the longer chain, so they continue along their new chain, while the 40% of other miners running BTC nodes do not recognize the BTU chain and continue mining the old one. But say that the new chain doesn't really catch on--the market doesn't pay much for BTU coins, and miners realize that mining the old chain would make more money. Some of them switch back, and over time, the chain using the BTC rules grows longer than the new BTU chain. At this point, because the BTC rules are still valid to BTU nodes, the BTC chain becomes the longest valid chain *for everyone*. As a result, BTU nodes will discard the BTU chain and it will completely cease to exist. All transaction history from that chain will disappear--all BTU coins will be gone. For a holder/trader, worse than holding onto, say, BTU coins valued at 1/10th of BTC, you would in fact hold nothing, as BTU coins no longer exist at all.
BIP148 interacts similarly with the current ruleset, but in the opposite direction. If a chainsplit does persist after BIP148 activation, but eventually the 148 chain grows longer, then the history of the non-148 chain following the split will disappear as it re-orgs into the 148 chain. If you bet against BIP148 and lose, having sold your coins on the 148 chain for coins on the legacy chain, then the re-org will wipe out your legacy coins, since at that point there would only be the BIP148 chain.

His node was probably using RBF with custom software; the wording of the rest of the article makes it sound like others probably weren't (or at least weren't expected to be doing so). It notes that XT nodes helped propagate the transaction, which wouldn't be notable if it used opt-in RBF because all supporting nodes would help at that point. It also mentions that some miners might not have accepted the first transaction because of the low fee on it. If opt-in RBF was being used, it wouldn't matter to note this since they would also be assumed to accept the second one anyways. Though regardless, miners can do transaction replacement even if the transaction doesn't signal for opt-in RBF (or if the opt-in option doesn't exist).

Litecoin volumes would have to increase dramatically to get anywhere close to using this capacity though. Personally I'd be interested in seeing how miserable initial sync would be after a year of effectively 8MB blocks (which is around 400GB of blockchain), but I doubt we'll get to see it there.

Why not? They created and maintain it, and do so in what they think is the best way. If others agree, they will use it; if not, they can, as you suggest, create their own forks and try to get people to agree to use those instead.


Gavin largely stopped contributing for years before his key was revoked following the bamboozling. Prior to that he had already stopped contributing to the code and had started doing things like trying to push a 20MB blocks hardfork without any testing--which he much later confirmed himself by actually testing it would have been problematic.

Nothing is "moved out" of the block for segwit supporting nodes ([about 85% of nodes]( For compatibility reasons, old nodes get blocks with the witness data for segwit transactions removed, but segwit nodes simply receive larger blocks containing more transactions.


Only if someone spamming signatures was somehow outpricing everyone else from using the network. If this was consistently a problem, Bitcoin would be screwed for reasons unrelated to block storage--no one's transactions would be going through because the spammer is pricing them out! Otherwise, segwit blocks work no differently than blocks do now--a 1.9MB block will contain 1.9MB of transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:28:19
You could run multiple nodes, but there's little point in running nodes if you're not actually using them to transact (at least as far as promoting BIP148 goes). BIP148 is not a sybil attack, and it doesn't actually care about the exact number or percentage of nodes that are running it. What is important is that economic activity is running the BIP148 code as this is what pressures miners to actually stay on the chain that users are using.

I don't know why Luke made this assertion. I know that while I'm personally running the BIP148 0.3 code right now, I will definitely revert to stock Core if I do not see support from major exchanges as the flag day gets closer. Though I would like to see segwit activate sooner rather than later, I do not think that BIP148's method of activation makes sense without overwhelming support from these major players. [BIP149]( on the other hand is less aggressive and does not require the same sort of support to avoid disruption. If included in regular releases of Bitcoin Core, just the normal upgrade process would likely be enough to have ~85% of nodes upgraded within a year, and ~95% in a year and a half, with unupgraded nodes still functioning just fine.

What he's talking about is protection from potentially getting re-org'd, which would completely wipe the history of a chain from the point where it diverged from the other. In the case of BTU, BTU nodes would recognize blocks that do not conform to BTC consensus rules, but BTC nodes would ignore a BTU chain that does not meet the BTC rules and continue to build on what they consider to be the valid chain. However, the BTC chain would still be valid from the perspective of BTU nodes, so if the BTC chain were to grow longer than some divergent BTU chain, BTU nodes would switch back (re-org) to seeing the BTC chain as the longest valid chain, completely wiping out the divergent BTU chain. With BIP148, the risk is reversed--BIP148 nodes would not follow a Bitcoin chain that does not conform to BIP148's rules, but non-BIP148 nodes will still see the BIP148 chain as valid. If a chain split does occur, there is potential if the BIP148 chain eventually grows longer for legacy nodes to re-org to follow that chain, wiping out the history of the non-148 supporting chain following the split.
Obviously, this has large implications for trading--if your chain ends up getting re-org'd, all your coins on that chain will cease to exist!

The ETH split did not have this issue because the new rules that were introduced in ETH made both chains incompatible with one another. It'd be the same as a Bitcoin fork doing something like moving some of the old coins to a new address (without the proper signatures): the software that decided to do the move would only accept a blockchain where the move happened, whereas the normal software would never accept a blockchain that includes the move because it breaks the rules. Neither could re-org into the other.
In the case of BTU though, BTC rules do not violate BTU rules, but BTU rules do violate BTC rules. Thus, a BTC chain is valid for BTU nodes, but a BTU chain is not valid to BTC nodes, resulting in one-way re-org risk.

There have been some mistaken conceptions about this, much of which likely stems from not quite understanding how the weight metric works. Real estimates for the size of segwit blocks should hover somewhere around 2MB, maybe a bit higher if usage patterns change. Larger could be produced, but sizes like [3.7MB]( are not practical blocks that we should expect to see.
You are correct that segwit does assign a lower weight to signature data, with the rationale that the long-term costs of signatures is significantly lower than that of creating more UTXOs. This does have an effect on relative costs, yes, but it will not change that transactions which have more inputs will still cost more than transactions with less inputs (all else remaining the same)--it will just be less of a difference than what you get now. As an extension, do you oppose the implementation of schnorr signatures for similar reasons? Signature aggregation is obviously more beneficial for transactions which have many signatures that can be combined, but it is also objectively an increase in efficiency, as less data needs to be stored for the same effect.


True according to who? Certainly not according to Blockstream, nor according to all the other teams working on their own independent LN implementations. There are many concerns regarding blocksize increases beyond segwit, ranging from questioning their technical viability to criticizing the required upgrade mechanisms, but the "Blockstream Lightning monopoly" angle is absurd.
Off-chain transactions will continue to be done with Bitcoin, and if we can have better, more secure, lower-trust ways to do them, that's much better than what we have today. It is almost certain that the majority of Bitcoin "transactions" today are done off-chain, largely through centralized entities like exchanges and gambling sites. I think it's fair to assume that miners are not getting the same fees from these off-chain transactions as they would if they were all done on-chain, which is the same as you would expect with payment channels that need to settle on-chain. There are obviously trade-offs between on-chain and off-chain transactions, but segwit makes it possible to build better off-chain solutions that are more secure and involve less trust, which is a win for Bitcoin as a whole.
EDIT: I guess I should mention that my intent was never to suggest that segwit does not alter some of the economics of Bitcoin, but that it does not do so in a thoughtless or harmful way. Almost any change to Bitcoin is going to change how the market responds to it to some extent, including innovations outside of the protocol itself. The blockchain is still required to do transactions with segwit. Miners still get paid with segwit. Things will shift some, likely in ways we can't fully predict, but a Bitcoin with segwit will be objectively more useful than a Bitcoin without segwit.

Hmm, thanks for the reply--honestly we're not so far off in what we want here. I generally agree with what you said, though I'd like 100x capacity at a sooner date than hardware would allow from just stuffing things into the blockchain (and I'm sure that you would too).
I think the major disagreement is our level of conservatism towards load increases right now. Ideally we would want tech to equal or outpace growth in Bitcoin, and I'm not convinced that this is happening for things like initial block sync and UTXO set growth, even at 1MB blocks. I support the increase that comes with segwit, but feel that even that is not without risk. Like many developers have stated, observing the results of a smaller bump would give us better perspective for doing a bump to something larger in the future. Also because of these concerns, I am more interested in seeing more efficient improvements to capacity in the shorter-term, including things signature aggregation and LN; I like the privacy improvements of some of this stuff as well.
I think we both want the same end-game Bitcoin. I'm just more worried about breaking the tech than pricing use cases out right now. After all, Bitcoin is already priced out by Visa and Paypal as far as most consumers are concerned. When it comes to transactions that need censorship resistance, Bitcoin is still a cheap option, and with second layer tech, maybe it can also get competitive in the general payments market.

Where did you hear this? Segwit or not, all transaction and signature data is part of the block, though with segwit there is the *option* to strip witness data if one does not want or need to store or transmit it, whenever this is useful. [Anyone who has worked with the code]( will confirm this.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:11:34


That's really dangerous with BIP148 because at any point the non-BIP148 chain could get re-org'd out of existence if the BIP148 chain grows longer. Basically, there can only be two chains if the BIP148 chain is the shorter chain--otherwise it converges into one chain, and all transactions not on the BIP148 chain effectively never existed.
@_date: 2017-05-07 09:22:26


Umm, it's different in the code. If you're asking what difference it makes in practical usage, it probably doesn't matter; more transactions is more transactions, regardless of how they're organized on your disk. I guess my point was that it's misleading and inaccurate to talk about "the 1Mb block" when no such block exists.


A significant amount of transactions are probably doing things that don't involve value transfer, like the weird cause of the recent mempool bloat involving a strange and inefficient timestamping system. Luke calls these things spam, which is fine if that's what he wants to call them; I don't really care. What I was specifically addressing was segwit blocks with intentionally bloated signatures, which is how you get *really* big segwit blocks (you won't get [3.7MB blocks]( from normal usage). I doubt there is a use-case that would benefit from making blocks like that, so the only reason they would get made would be an intentional spam attack. We have seen these before, but not over an especially prolonged period, because they're expensive and don't themselves accomplish anything for the attacker (unlike inefficient timestamping or whatever, which does do *something*).


It's also much, much easier to price out nodes at 8MB blocks. There are tradeoffs--I'm sure you've heard about them a million times.
Personally, I'd like to see a Bitcoin able to service at least 100x more people than it currently is... maybe 1000x, maybe more, I'm not sure. That said, I really don't think that [100MB blocks]( is going to make for a functional globally distributed p2p network, so I'm open to options that scale a *bit* better than what we have in Bitcoin now.

Some quotes from nullc on the mailing list:








In summary, it's a balance of considerations. BIP148 has to potential to activate much faster, but also has higher potential to cause disruption. BIP149 will be slower, but has less potential for disruption. Something that Luke is suggesting at this point, however, is that there is enough support for BIP148 that, unless BIP148 becomes widely adopted, *some* disruption is already guaranteed.
In the end, everyone has to make up their own mind on the issue.

[Just noticed this article went up]( Don't have the time to do more than just skim it right now, but [the first in this series]( was good, and it looks like it describes how LN routing works. Basically, you don't need a direct channel with the person you're trying to pay, so long as you have a channel to someone (who has a channel to someone who has a channel to someone...) who has a channel with the party you're trying to pay. Multi-hop routing like this has already been implemented in at least one version of the software being developed (there was a reddit thread on it a while back, but I don't have it on-hand).

We are trying to increase it once, with a softfork: it's called segwit. Almost everyone wants to observe the impacts of a modest increase, and only after doing so should we be considering any further increases.

Non-witness data (so effectively 4MB blocks or so, because all transactions need signatures), or total data (transactions + signatures)? Because segwit gives the latter, and I don't believe there is widespread agreement that the former is safe--segwit's costing changes are designed to mitigate some of the risks of larger blocks. Or are you suggesting there be an option to signal for a hardfork just for the sake of hardforking, when a softfork could accomplish the same thing?

A lot of people were also sold the dream early on: free transactions to anyone in the world, confirmed in 10 minutes!

I'd be interested in seeing the effects of full blocks in Litecoin, but I doubt it'll ever get that far. What I'm curious about is how the equivalent of 8MB Bitcoin blocks would affect people's willingness to run nodes over time. 8MB every 10 minutes is around 400GB of blockchain a year. How much bandwidth will this end up eating? How many people will want to store this? How long will initial sync end up taking and what will the UTXO set look like, even after just a single year?
This would be interesting to see on a coin that's actually being used--but I really don't want to run that test on Bitcoin, because worst case is that the whole thing collapses (sorry Litecoin!) and the network is just permanently screwed.

It seems likely that he's echoing the common rbtc complaint about the segwit "discount" being unfair because of segwit's costing changes. There's a very easy fix for this: just use segwit transactions! Segwit transactions are just flat out better for the network anyways (they verify faster, are better balanced for long-term costs, and enable many other improvements, on and off-chain) and 85% of nodes already have segwit support just waiting to activate. It's already a feature that old nodes are able to continue making transactions at all--try making transactions with an old node after a hard fork. Complaining that people who don't upgrade do not benefit as much as people who do upgrade is just stupid.
Miners have a couple months to do the right thing and just activate BIP141 segwit; if they don't, BIP148 is going to kick in and they get to deal with that.

I would absolutely run this. Looking at [the numbers for current node versions]( it seems that 85% of Core nodes are running one of the last two major release versions and 95% are running one of the last three major releases. In a timeframe of 1 year, we could probably expect 85% adoption of a BIP149 supporting version of Core, and 95% in a year and a half, just from the normal upgrade cycle. Also, segwit is still a softfork, so nodes (and even miners) which have not upgraded would still continue to function.

I will not claim to be especially technically competent, but these assertions are completely beyond disbelief.


A 128x load increase is not a huge change? You can't seriously believe that this would not affect people's decisions whether or not to run a full node in a very large way.


According to what measurement? Just looking at my currently running node, its CPU usage seems to bottom out at ~0.17%, with occasional spikes as high as 10%. And this is just normal operation--attacks that creates blocks which are designed to be difficult to validate need to be considered as well. There is room for growth here, but to over 1000x the current possible transaction rate? I don't see it with current tech.
Initial sync times are outpacing the growth rate of technology *today*, and you're suggesting that it would be fine for the rate to be sped up 100 times? Unless there is a massive breakthrough in CPU technology in the near future (there could be, we don't know now), sync times won't just "take longer"--they'll continue to push towards being impossible in any reasonable timeframe, if not outright outpacing the rate at which validation is possible.


Yes, yes it is a problem. The UTXO set is currently kept on disk, but an efficient cache is maintained that is required for node software to run as well as it does. My understanding is that the resource requirements for this grow proportionally with the size of the set. SSDs would help, yes, but they are still slower than RAM. The suggestion that nodes have 10 minutes to validate blocks is absurd--miners are nodes too, after all. If a miner cannot quickly validate transactions, then they are not able to enforce Bitcoin's rules. Are you suggesting that miners should spy-mine for entire 10-minute stretches, not being able to know whether or not the chain they are building on top of is valid until after the next block has been added? What about when blocks are found faster than every 10 minutes? Should it just be an expectation that blocks will get orphaned, even after multiple confirmations?


Sorry, I cannot do a lot on the latter--I simply do not have the skillset required. But the level of imagination required to think that today we could come close to anything near 128MB blocks and have a sustainable system is, quite frankly, delusional. I support scaling through modest increases like we get with segwit and signature aggregation, more efficient methods like LN, and maybe even some form of blocksize increase after we see the impacts of these--but in no way does increasing the blocksize 100x today seem like a feasible approach.

I agree wholly with this statement. I am running BIP148 supporting software, but I do feel that it is too aggressive to be considered an addition to Core's main builds. I also don't see it being likely to succeed, but would be happy if it did catch on in a big way.
That said, I absolutely support [BIP149]( inclusion in Core, as it is largely just a flag-day softfork to segwit (unless miners activate it first) with a long period given for people to get prepared. Regardless, it does not split the network, even for those who do not upgrade--at least barring malicious miners intentionally building a segwit-invalid chain to trick old nodes, which can be fairly trivially guarded against by upgrading, using an upgraded bridge node, or even just looking at some third party source just to make sure that you're on a valid chain.
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:49:52
Actually I'm pretty sure you could softfork back to 2 if 3 was too much. Like now we could hypothetically do a softfork to 500kB blocks and old nodes would have no problem with them since they're under their limit of 1MB.

A UASF does not have to be disruptive, nor carry great risk of a chain split. As a specific proposal, BIP148 has high potential to be disruptive as it attempts to force miners to do something--but this is not the only possible way to UASF. [BIP149]( is also a UASF, and essentially is just flag-day activation of the segwit softfork (unless miners activate it before the flag-day). Flag-day softforks are nothing new and were to my knowledge the only upgrade mechanism ever used by Satoshi... though of course it was easier in the days where his word was law. With a flag-day sufficiently far in the future, it is reasonable to expect that the large majority of nodes would upgrade without any special effort needing to be made ([we can see that ~95% of nodes are running one of the last 3 major versions]( and since segwit remains a softfork, unupgraded nodes would still be able to participate in the network.

And much of the "evidence" he'll use to back this claim up is simply false. One common example is the claim that segwit has made Bitcoin no longer "a chain of digital signatures", which is based on either a misunderstanding or intentional misrepresentation of how segwit works--segwit in no way has removed signatures from the blockchain. Segwit has changed the ordering of tx data and signature data in a way that allowed unwanted transaction malleability to be fixed (and for the blocksize limit to be increased via soft fork), but any segwit-supporting node that was archiving the whole blockchain before continues to archive the whole blockchain with segwit--signature data and all.

BU can block segwit at the moment because it is, for the time being, compatible with other Bitcoin node software and produces blocks which follow existing consensus rules. So long as the most-work chain follows the existing rules, BU will continue mining on it and thus be able to block segwit. If BU ever got majority hashpower and started producing blocks that aren't compatible with other software it would fork off onto its own chain which other nodes would see as invalid, resulting in two persistent chains like the ETH incident.

The full blocks kept by segwit nodes, containing ALL signatures and transactions are, however, able to be larger than 1MB, up to the weight limit of 4 million.

The situation is the opposite in this case. The only node software that intends to hardfork is the segwit2x software--all other users currently running Core or any other node software will automatically consider the hardfork invalid and ignore it. Basically, the hardfork is "blocked" by default. The onus is on the segwit2x team to convince everyone to switch to their software before the hardfork (3 months after segwit activation)--and it's hard to see that being successful.

You liked that one too, eh? [The presentation]( also claimed that increased usage would bump the Bitcoin price by 1000x. At 1GB blocks, this would imply over 400BTC in fees per block at a valuation of $650000 per Bitcoin--that's $260 MILLION for EVERY BLOCK. I don't know in what world this seems like a reasonable expectation; certainly not this one.

"Weight" as a method of accounting blocksize limits did not exist prior to segwit and was (to my understanding) the revelation that made a segwit softfork with a blocksize increase possible. It was noticed that signatures could be removed without making transactions invalid--just non-standard--such that a scheme that increases the amount of witness data allowed could be made compatible with older nodes by stripping out the witness data, yet allow for more transactions (and more data) per block.


Certainly not in a practical sense, no. [Blocks nearing 4MB are possible]( but need to contain an extremely abnormal amount of signature data, which is not something that will naturally happen in normal use-cases, and would almost certainly be an attack (though an attacker would have to outbid every other transaction to make such a block) as there probably isn't any utility in having that much signature data with that little transaction data.

Also @ It's relatively safe to ignore this warning (there's nothing you can really do to mitigate the possible risks in any case). What's happening is miners have begun signaling for a segwit activation mechanism that isn't defined in Bitcoin Core software. If things go well, segwit will get activated for all supporting nodes currently on the network and there will be no disruption. Miners *could* cause a (probably temporary) chainsplit if they don't actually enforce the rules they are signaling for, but there's not much that a regular user can do about that--and besides, it would largely just be some miners splitting off on their own since users aren't running software that understands what they're doing.

Actually no, if the patent was valid and allowed overt use of ASICBoost, then it's probably in the patent holder's interest to activate segwit, which only breaks *covert* ASICBoost. Overt forms of ASICBoost still work with segwit, but are easily detectable, so patent violations would be obvious.

The biggest problem with incentivizing nodes is that you're effectively paying people to sybil attack the network. If running a node can actually generate positive income, it would be in the interests of whoever can run nodes most efficiently to spin up as many as possible to make a profit, with the competition for whatever the reward is crowding out less efficient nodes, defeating the purpose of the original incentive.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:09:07
In the long-run, they wouldn't mine completely empty blocks as these would give them nothing (unless perhaps they're building on their own chain). Something they would do though if there is not a consistent enough fee incentive is "mine in-place", or in other words, rather than building on top of the chain, they would try to orphan the previous block to collect its fees. For example, say there was 1.1BTC in fees in their mempool and a block gets mined that takes 1BTC of fees. At this point the miner could either try to build on the chain and collect 0.1BTC in the next block, or they could try to produce two blocks in a row and orphan the other miner's block, collecting all 1.1BTC instead. If the fee difference is large enough, the latter might be the better strategy from the miner's perspective--though it's certainly not better for the Bitcoin network.

@_date: 2017-07-17 22:40:46
Current software (ie Core nodes) will remain completely compatible, yes. BIP91 is a rule for miners that forces segwit activation to happen by intentionally orphaning blocks that do not signal for the segwit activation that already exists in the large majority of Bitcoin nodes. Existing nodes will just continue to act normally, except that they might observe blocks that do not signal segwit readiness getting re-orged from time to time because miners are not building on top of them.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:12:42


Miners can signal whatever bits they want--it does not necessarily mean that their node actually is able to support the feature that they are signaling for. While we hope that they have been honest in signaling their support for BIP91, fake signaling has been a problem in the past (it's part of the reason segwit was deployed with a 95% threshold), so it's not impossible for some miners to not actually be enforcing the BIP91 rules even though they signal for them.
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:18:20
In this particular case, it does not mean a lot for our nodes since it was expected and we know what's going on. Miners are starting to signal for their BIP91 activation of segwit, which basically works like BIP148 with some extra signaling (because agreements). Assuming things go smoothly, segwit will be locked-in and activated for all nodes without disruption.

As I mentioned, zero-conf was never actually secure; mining a "double-spend" was never against consensus rules, so it could always be done. Though you're right that in small transactions this probably wouldn't be an issue the vast majority of the time. 


Since RBF is entirely a node/wallet policy, there's no reason that you couldn't flag your preference for no RBF in a QR code. There's no standardized way of doing this at the moment as far as I know; it's probably a feature worth developing though. Really, you could even include a plaintext message stating something like: only non-RBF payments accepted; RBF payments will be rejected and refunded minus fee upon receival. A more elegant solution would be nice, but you get the idea. Though in the case of zero-conf without RBF, the merchant would also have to assume responsibility in the event that the transaction does not confirm (fee issues or what have you), so there's different issues associated with both from a merchant's perspective. Nothing is broken here; you just need to make your terms clear and handle the different situations properly.


And it would really help sometimes if it was easier to use! I was really looking forward to seeing GUI features introduced into 0.13.X, but it looks like they missed the cutoff and are postponed until 0.14.X. Can't wait.


Sorry, not interested.
I do think that it would be good if we had more accessible tools to work effectively with RBF, but the policy itself is not at all harmful if handled properly. If you don't like it, don't use it; contrary to what you said, this applies both to senders and receivers.

Segwit already includes a "block cost" increase, which is the equivalent of a blocksize increase in that it allows more data (ie more transactions) to be included in each block, so I would not say a blocksize increase is "years away" at this point; and if you want both, now that's just double-dipping ;). Otherwise, agreed that both and can have useful stuff as well as junk on them, though I'd consider the less anger and conspiracy-laden of the two.

My understanding is that segwit itself allows for blocks up to ~4MB to be created, if they were comprised almost entirely of witness data. This won't happen in practical application, but it is possible if done intentionally. Thus, if the cost limit were doubled on top of this, it could allow the creation of ~8MB blocks, which is too much at this point in time, even with the mitigating factors coming with segwit.

Personally, I would be very happy to see BIP149 included as part of 0.15.0. Segwit activation in a year from its release, giving time to either upgrade or be prepared to not be upgraded. Since it's still a softfork, even unupgraded nodes would continue to work, but would probably want to protect themselves against seeing potential (though unlikely) invalid segwit spends, which could involve setting up a bridge node, or even just checking an external segwit-supporting block explorer.

I'd say this is a very subjective statement. Certainly, there are aspects of ETC which seem more desirable, such as not being the Ethereum Foundation's plaything with a ledger that can be modified on a whim. At the same time, ETH got to where it is as the Ethereum Foundation's plaything, so I'm not sure what actually drives the ETH market to begin with. As far as I can tell, the market and community has been pretty happy following the "cult of Vitalik" thus far, which is why I feel that ETH-F will probably remain the more prominent chain going forward (as long as people continue to express interest in ETH, anyhow). If it didn't though--well, that'd be interesting, wouldn't it?

Because they are confused. Many seem to think that a larger blocksize alone is the key to adoption (wow, such 6-10tps). Many seem to think that a blocksize increase is a minor technical change with few if any adverse effects. Many seem to think that a hardfork is simple and easy for everyone (what's easy for you might be much harder for a large business). Many seem to think that full blocks are the end of the world (even though blocks will fill at *any* size depending on the cost). Many fail to see the benefits of segwit and the potential of payment channels (instant transactions are a great start). And many have just decided that they hate everyone who contributes to Bitcoin Core.
It really is unfortunate that this has been ongoing for as long as it has. The approaching deployment of segwit and the subsequent potential for payment channel technologies to break onto the scene should be huge cause for excitement; yet instead we're still fighting the "but 2MB hardfork" line.

Generally though you're looking at deals that only save $10-20 and are going to be a long wait for shipping. I can't imagine they'd get a great bulk deal for Bitcoin wallets (how much demand is there even?), so it'd probably be better to just buy the things through normal channels.

RBF contentious, even when opt-in? Why do you think this; is it because you think it reduces the reliability of zero-conf transactions? Even without signaling (or before there even was a standard for this), zero-conf could be replaced (or "double-spent") at a miner's discretion--there's nothing in the consensus rules that says this isn't allowed. Besides, not signaling RBF (which is the default setting, and very few wallets even have GUI options to change this, not even Bitcoin Core) will flag your transactions the same as they've always been, nothing gained or lost.
And yes, as wrote, RBF is just a node policy and has nothing to do with forks; this is why miners are free to either honor or ignore RBF signaling without creating invalid blocks.

Paper wallets are generally just a single private key. Spending from them requires importing the key into some software (probably a Bitcoin wallet) and using that to spend. However, best practice is to avoid address re-use, so the change will likely by default go to another address generated by the wallet. The other address will only be known to the wallet software (your paper wallet only has the one address), so if you delete that wallet thinking that the remainder of your funds are still controlled by the paper wallet, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.
Now, you could have a "paper wallet" that's just an HD list of 12-24 words, but that's not what paper wallets generally refer to. This would always be able to recover funds on all addresses from the seed words, though obviously still requires use of software to spend funds.
