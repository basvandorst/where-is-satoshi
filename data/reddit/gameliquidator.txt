Can you elaborate?

Even still, Cash App is pretty functional. While I can't load from existing BTC, I can convert any capital I have latently sitting into coin (that while is not able to receive deposits from external sources, CAN be withdrawn to external sources, important to me, unlike say Robin Hood).
While this doesn't help with the stack, it helps with my dollars that I don't want to hold. Then I can sell in real time and buy with the debit card as I please. I find it to be pretty great, though limited at this time. And if ever I want the BTC off the app, I just send it out. Obviously it won't return at this time, but none the less, great app. Also, since it offers instant debit refund, you can sell BTC and have it in the bank within minutes if you pay the fee, exceedingly useful for those who prefer to keep all wealth in coin and hold as little dollars as possible. Once Cash App accepts coin deposits, game on.

A greater block size increases the cost associated with storing the blockchain amongst else, increased costs have the same effect as increased regulatory hurdles (decreases ability of upstarts/small organizations and cements power of existing/large entities). Inherently this means that mining would become more centralized as a general rule (similar to CPU&gt;GPU&gt;ASIC). This is how I see it at least.

Pretty sure my BTC keychain cost me about 1.5 BTC at the time (15 dollars). I always think about how it cost me 1.5 BTC.

Where is your information coming from that leads you to believe the United States would even fathom a return to the gold standard in current political climate? It would decimate the welfare/warfare state. 
Now some other nations? That's a different story, they have every incentive to move to a stable condition and no longer be at the whims of the failing Dollar monetary policy.

Last time I was selling the bear (600-800 range), this time I am buying the bear.  I like how it tastes.

Have you had any experience with this card? Would love to hear some feedback.

As if people needed incentive to spend capital, ridiculous. If conditions were free market and not contorted, warped, bizzaro market with regulatory burdens amongst else, capital would find it's way to being spent productively quite on its own. The Fed (and other CBs) are simply robber barons feeding the endless government spending worldwide while draining value out of commoners. Their time comes.

Enjoy the inclusion of the Times page.

Indeed, we needed time to make sure the horse made it into Troy.
No doubt, though, the horse is well into Troy now and dawn approaches.

Would love to hear whomsoever is downvoting's actual thoughts as opposed to a hit and run click as to why ever more theft will somehow make this situation that is beget of systematic theft better.
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:13:13
In America, why would we want to steal more from anyone? The solution isn't to steal more from the civilians. 
Regarding the profiteering, that problem lies with the authorities that continue to allow this charade of budget/monetary policy and therefore create conditions for feeding frenzy by predatory individuals that are the symbiotic other side of said authorities. Remove their power and remove these problems.

Lol.. because central planning, de facto massive inflation, and distribution of capital by central bank cronies has not produced massive wealth inequality presently...

Preservation of wealth is the road to wealth, so in a round about way the former group is right, but I concur the focus should be on the actual conditions creating the problem and not the auxiliary result they  hope to benefit from. Either way, even they inadvertently (by that I mean knowingly or not) aid the cause of upending the tea table.

In my opinion, must certainly be influenced by Austrain Economics. That singular literature specifically? Who could say, but most certainly the general thinking field.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:59:32
I don't know about "still very valid", I think that's a severe understatement. More like "more important and critical than ever".
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:30:31
General lack of education to be found in the American system (hah, more like intentionally the opposite to be found...), propaganda, indifference, the list goes on, choose!
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:54:54
I'll take it.

Short term bad, yes, but long term a brighter future awaits moving away from these fiat scenarios. The dollar's clock is ticking regardless, Bitcoin's rise will simply accelerate matters greatly. The Japanification of the world isn't a great outcome either, so why not get the party started sooner than later? If we had honest and sound money, we wouldn't be in this ever worsening predicament as it stands, I would suggest. Monetary policy in the States certainly seems driven to destroy existing hegemony to anyone with half a brain (one could argue, at any rate). I've been preparing for years for this reality as I fully expect it to be realized in my lifetime. If I am incorrect in my assessment, my progeny will benefit greatly from my preparation (again, I expect) assuming they aren't squanderers...  But that is my responsibility to bestow upon them proper critical thinking and analytical capacity.
Nobody "wants" (per se) what will happen as a result of this financial dynamic change, but it is coming regardless. Whether that is next year or in fifty years, there is no other outcome (regarding the USD, not BTC).

This is a pretty neat sub.

Yes, they will likely "work hard" torching these institutions and revolting.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:25:04
That's the goal!

**Or...** how about we let the market decide the value and "cost" of money instead of econowizards indoctrinated in Keynesian philosophy..! Balance would be found the majority of the time, some natural warping is to be expected however.
