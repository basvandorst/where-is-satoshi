omg I really thought u were trolling. shit is serious.
@_date: 2016-04-16 11:05:34
What is the basis of this argument? Complete nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:57
is this a quality meme?
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:58:57
Exactly. Don't even know (or care) how much XRP is worth in USD. I just know it's around 15k (sat) right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:29:33
you know what other reputable exchange was based in Tokyo? :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:14:44
this meme is strong enough.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:55:36
LN is true decentralization?
@_date: 2018-09-18 00:53:48
Lies 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:12:35
can I have a real shareable version of this pls?
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:02:00
this is a really enlightening view and should be shared somewhere separately. I had to dig deep in the comments to find it.
 thanks for sharing
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:58:33

@_date: 2015-06-18 00:06:58
as a Greek I totally agree and this is exactly what I thought upon seeing for the first time. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 02:12:17
and down 50% YTD
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:04:14
long doge short bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-29 19:44:56
I wish Greece was a bit more like-minded!
@_date: 2014-04-28 12:13:42
and this is why PoS/PoW coins are the future my friends
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:26:38
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:30:57
didn't know about this! just set it up now, running one of the 29 full nodes in Greece. Only 4 of us are running the latest version! :/
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:00:36
exactly. well said.
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:31:06
credit cards weren't evident, everyone rejected them and thought it would never work.
touch screens really became popular with the iPhone in 2007, before that, they were not really functional to most people.
all of these are revolutionary technologies that everyone thought would never work.
don't take everything for granted, in full hindsight everything looks easy and simple
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:24:18
not too shabby
let us know when u accept dogecoin ;)
@_date: 2014-05-07 15:50:43
tulipfutures is right.
@_date: 2017-02-17 18:32:38
I honestly don't get why bitcoiners who are supposed to be Libertarian support Trump when he stands on the exact opposite side on most issues.. Either bitcoiners don't get what Libertarianism values are or they just want to see the world burn through trump and profit from it. Both attitudes are despicable.

yep error 500
been getting it since this morning when logging in
@_date: 2015-05-16 16:22:05
such an avant-garde comment.  Do you have an actual answer?
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:23:05
wooo! high tip thursdays!
@_date: 2017-02-18 11:44:15
you live in 2013? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 16:21:05
I' m asking if it can theoretically handle more than that maximum. Do you have an answer?
@_date: 2017-02-18 16:30:48
no, I was talking specifically about SOME people, bitcoiners WHO **ARE** supposed to be Libertarian, I didn't say ALL bitcoiners, you even quoted me. Read what you quote before going on idiotic rants about things I never said like IMA BE RICH or that I'm going to take over the world.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:41:07
can someone explain what the hell is going on?
@_date: 2016-06-02 02:13:42
theoretically it's quite easy to do...
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:32:20
have u checked on these days? this is dangerous... 
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:33:26
believe me, they do feel like losers.
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:43:02
which is the time when most of them were set up AFAIK
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:07:31
IT WILL
@_date: 2015-08-09 05:55:45
and now it's gone again. Pffft.
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:15:37
that means SELL
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:49:23
I don't disagree on the principle of what you said, but in this case, it is the government that shut down the banks.
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:26:08
it's the government that fucked him. not the bankers.

you need to chill mate. The fact you're freaking out doesn't mean everyone else should too. I have been in crypto since 2013 and for some reason I did see this dump coming, took the opportunity to increase my BTC holdings by shorting all cryptos on bitmex,  my portfolio is near its all time highs (yes in $ terms too).
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:49:09
someone please fix this and make a 2017 version  :)
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:16:59
oh  nice! thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:35:52
or this one Ƀ
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:40:36
Thank you.

I remember when I first saw Bitcoin added on my phone's stock android autocorrect back in late 2013 I think it was. Felt like we were coming out of the deep underground into the masses.
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:59:27
@_date: 2016-10-23 10:58:54
they are not, actually.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:32:02
first thing I noticed too. I thought I had lost it for a second.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:40:54
all mining is a scam?
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:32:18
not really tho
@_date: 2015-11-19 06:49:42
fyrstikken? really?
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:47:46
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:44:05
I think they're on the same level. From what I know they hang out together and totally agree with each other :&gt;
