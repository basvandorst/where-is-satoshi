I am really wondering what is the true purpose of your post?
You are obviously a heavy Internet user (the term "ELI5" is not that well known among moderate Internet users as you probably think it is...), so you can't possibly not know that Googling a "buying Bitcoin" will give you just the list of your options in a perfect order.
So, what is it? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 08:18:19
I don't think you are using the right example. You are describing internal bot trading with each other, to fake up the trading volume and I am not arguing that this is not the case and/or that this is indeed a bad thing. **Moreover**, such fake trading is going to stay fake, with or without fees charged by the exchange (it is their fees any way).
However, when a real person comes to use this platform, and sells/buys bitcoin, This trade IS real, whether the fee was charged for such trade or not. Now, of course a zero fee exchange with any given number of users, will obviously have higher trading volume than exchange with the same user base, but which charges trading fees. This is simply because the spread will be much smaller, but it does not mean that such trades are fake.
@_date: 2016-04-29 06:34:16
Why a zero fee trading is not a real trading in your eyes?

I would like to understand better why would some people say **classic is dead** (EIL5)? Not being too much into the tech stuff, I originally thought this(one or the other or the compromise) scaling solution will be just decided on and that is it. But, from what I understand is **already happening in reality**, miners are actually beginning to mine all these different "types" of blocks, INCLUDING the "Classic". 
Where all these different types of blocks mining is leading the system? Is this now just a "race" to a 75% fork, is this is what it is about?
@_date: 2016-04-26 02:49:48
I never even thought about looking at the matter from this perspective alone.
**By this logic, the more miners would stop mining, the higher the price will become**. I am of course exaggerating here, but are we really sure that the BTC network would benefit if some miners will drop out in a few weeks? What about transaction confirmation times and the whole "working at capacity" issues? What about the matter of system decentralization? I am pretty sure that all of the Chinese miners will most likely stay after halvening.

Are those some very small purchases that you are getting for 25-30% discount?
I still don't get it, why those with real gift cards would settle for such huge losses. These cards are selling on Ebay with the premium and/or why not just sell actual merchandise, which is in demand (on amazon or Ebay). You make a listing for any item which sells well, once you have a bidder, just order this item from amazon using your gift card AND I believe you can have Amazon shiping the item directly to your bidder (different address than yours on file).

When ANY of you are referring to some 20% discount, please tell me what on earth are you talking about? 
Unless the other end is indeed someone with the stolen credit card and managed to purchase gift card, who on earth would sell amazon gift card for 20% off??? The only way this will work is if bitcoin price will drop to the point of a lot smaller factual discount. Moreover, if bitcoin price will grow (while you are waiting not predictable amount of time), Purse.io will ask you to add more bitcoins ("to reflect price fluctuation").
Anyone reading this topic is really ready to sell valid amazon cards for 20% off. Let me know, I'll buy in the thousands range.

So, why is this a number one news subject on the Bitcoin front? Everyone is THAT bored? 
Anyway, is he a super tech guy? I am not one for instance and while I am not new to bitcoin, this issue is a fresh discovery for me. As a user I would just hit the send button, as soon as the software would let me to. And I do know for a fact, that transactions these days do take a lot longer, regardless of the fee amount.
**By the way, how many confirmations was he suppose to wait for, before sending a payment?**(I mean minimum, please do not say, the more the better...)

of course! why do it if you don't want to report it?
Are we on the same page here? I asked why are you considering a zero fee trading as fake and I am saying that it is not, if it is between real users. 
Faking exchange's trading volume via bots by its owners, is a different story and it has nothing to do with the fees.

In my mind, the last spike to ATH was caused by huge buying volume in China. I remember very vividly my surprise of watching fast rise of BTC price from some $25 to about $400 levels, as we just passed the previous ATH of about $260 (just pior to Gox collapse). This was the time when people were watching closely and talked a lot about China's buying frenzy. Of note, the price gap between Chinese exchangers and those serving US and Europe was some $30 to $50. So, China basically pulled everybody else upward...
In other words, the $1000+ spike was not related to halving in my opinion, at least not that much.

@_date: 2015-06-18 02:12:50
This is not really a Peer-To-Peer, but a Peer-OKPay-Peer and OKPay will simply play the role of exchanger. 
To fund your OKPay account you need to send bank wire (which you can do with regular exchangers) and to withdraw fiat you need to request a bank wire (again, just as with exchangers). That OKPay accepts cryptocurrencies, makes them look like exchanger even more (you can obviously deposit cryptos to exchangers).
So, in my opinion this thing "looks like a duck and walks like a duck"...
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:45:26
It is of course good idea, but the more such system would grow, the more misappropriation of taxed funds will take place. Perhaps this could be not a local (particular country's) "government" but some more global structure.
Otherwise, any country's currently existing monetary system already has this feature. We pay taxes and we vote for anything society needs, including "green initiatives". How is your proposal different?

@_date: 2014-03-30 08:52:44
Perhaps, the whole thing needs to kind of "start over"?
I am sure a lot of people are looking at Bitcoin from it's value perspective and what they see, even at current prices, is some "commodity", which stands at the value growth rate in thousands of percents, within just about a year. THAT may look to them like a very, very overpriced "commodity", regardless of it's promise and/or future potential.

@_date: 2014-02-20 14:06:05
If they do reopen BTC withdrawals, they will likely put some sort of limits on the amounts. Although, if you are in time to get coins for 1/4th of a market value, such restriction would not matter.
The only concern I would have is that with such price difference people will definitely be selling withdrawn Gox coins on other exchangers. So, the Gox price will be shooting up while price on other exchangers will be going down, until the prices meet somewhere in the middle.
The amount of coins which was stuck on Gox before they halted withdrawals (officially) was some 70,000 BTC. So, I guess we should expect at least THAT much to be taken out and sold on other exchangers...
Good luck anyway.

If he really said and especially did that, the company stock holders should run from this company as soon as they can and as far as they can. The investment of this size, at this point of Bitcoin price and volatility by the company leader is a **plain suicide** in the eyes of the current financial world. This is a step that can only be made by truly insane and completely broke gambler in a last attempt to avoid suicide in physical sense.

I have a question:
If it is an absolute fact that a **(whooping) 7% of all bitcoins in existence** are stolen AND, they are still going to be in circulation, how could the whole system continue its very existence? 
Would everyone be totally fine holding and using Bitcoins, while knowing that 7% of every bitcoin they hold, was stolen from a someone. It is also NOT JUST SOMEONE, but a person they can even talk to.
Live example of the very uncomfortable situation is right here in this thread. Just think about it, here is the original poster of this thread and me for instance, with my bitcoin wallet with one bitcoin in it. **I can say with absolute certainty that 0.07 of BTC in my wallet belongs to the original poster.** We can blame the OP for his actions, we can point fingers at MtGox, Karpeles or anybody else, BUT the fact about that bitcoin in my wallet remains and it is a part of Bitcoin's future FOREVER.

Main stream media mentions MtGox as the main exchange every time they do coverage on Bitcoins. This effectively sends all new to Bitcoin people to MtGox. It is such new people who are the current user base of MtGox and this is quadruple bad, because the first thing they get for getting into Bitcoin, is being "Goxed" (= fu*ked up)

If they open withdrawals, Gox price will start going up, price on other exchangers will start going down. Prices will "meet" somewhere in between, after a couple of "waves" crossing one another.
People definitely will want to get out of Gox, unless management there will bring in at least some clarity about fiat withdrawals (this is another long standing issue with MtGox, but it is NOT on the forefront at the moment).

You are probably implying how to set up acceptance of Bitcoin payments and not get exposed to Bitcoin volatility. If that is the case, you will simply need to have someone selling received Bitcoins on the open market at all times.
This is easily doable, you will save on BitPay/Coinbase fees and can in fact earn on processing fees yourself instead.

Depending on the amount, it could cost A LOT more because Coinbase is charging percentage with no maximum, not flat fee like banks. 
So, this is good for small amount transfers which is still good. 
I just checked that to send 5 BTC via Coinbase (just above 2K USD) will cost about $50 (split between the parties). For comparison, Western Union from US to Spain is cheaper or even free (depending on sending source options) for this amount.
So the advantage of using Coinbase vs. anything else starts from about $400 or less.

You can't say it has nothing to do wiith Bitcoins for sure, because it was during this earnings report, when shareholders asked the CEO about company's expectations and future plans related to Bitcoin adoption. The answer was that not only will the company be adding Bitcoins to the company balance sheets (by taking a fraction of Bitcoin payments), but CEO added that a few days ago he personally made huge investment in Bitcoins. Of note, having Bitcoins on company balance sheets is a big (depending on amount they decide to hold) unpredictable variable, which has absolutely nothing to do with their primary business model.

All this actually makes sense and is an eye opening in a lot broader meaning. It occurred to me that this is pretty much like ALL federal agencies (and in turn their workers) are carrying their "duties". They are basically starting from the view that all entities in front of them, are by their definition "guilty" of whatever any given agency is "checking" them for. Thus, their ultimate goal is to prove that they ARE indeed "guilty". I am speaking in general terms and "checking" here can be anything federal agencies do: auditing, regulating, prosecuting et.c. and "guilty" is a compliance of all sorts.
Consequently, if agencies do not prove (at some significant enough rate) the "guilt" of the entity being "checked", they are considered by the Government as not doing their job. They can't just report to Government that they checked everybody and everything is fine. They MUST come up with actual "violations". This is why businesses are suffering, as they are practically sinking in dealing with the growing body of rules and regulations they must follow.
Speaking of prosecuting BTW, this exact same shit is happening at the highest degree in the "Justice" system. Here, district attorney's goal is to convict, no matter what. This is in fact where the notion of being able or not to "afford the justice" is coming from. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:25:36
You can try and it may even go through, but if you happen to get audited, it is not likely that IRS will accept these losses **because they have no way to verify your claims**. I think you can easily imagine how a not completely honest person may try to claim losses on Bitcoins trading, with the lack of thereof in reality.
In contrast, regulated entity, such as stocks broker for instance, reports all your trades to IRS and this is why your stocks related trading (with this broker) is all verifiable.

Sorry, but the "Use Kraken" at the end of this note, simply strikes out any and all potential concerns I could possibly otherwise have. 
Given that the important points have been already explained, my only conclusion here is to **stay clear from Kraken**. 
In my humble opinion, Kraken is not going anywhere in terms of becoming field's "player" of any significant degree. I think so, because  (1) I see no trading volume increase over the period of the last about 3 - 4 months (meaning no new people are coming to use Kraken), (2) trading volume is persistently WAY too low (so there is no use for high end traders) and (3) I have a hard time accepting the fact that Kraken's leader is any good at running business, especially knowing that the guy "likes to jump the ship" (I am referring to his "run" from Ripple Labs).

I wonder if Coinbase/Bitpay have any ongoing talks with Google about this. They must have, but if so, what are the answers? 
It seems to be not overly difficult implementation, just add anothing wallet funding source (Bitcoin) without actually dealing with Bitcoin transactions if they don't want to. Bitcoin transactions (and all coming with them liabilities) can be all outsourced (so to speak) to Bitpay or Coinbase (or both).

With all my personal likes of Bitcoin innovation, I would say that your post is a cheaply "built" trolling in favor of Bitcoin. Here is why:
You haven't lost anything (except $150 cash). Your ID's credit/debit cards will be replaced and you wouldn't even lose the $150, if you'd stick with plastic cards. All you need to do is to make calls and everything will be recovered for you.
Also, consider your $150 cash notes being an equivalent of a **"cold paper wallet" of your USD** and consider that you may have had paper wallet of your BTC in the same physical wallet you lost. This means that your Bitcoins could have been lost as easily, making such loss just as not recoverable as $150 cash. 
**In other words, if only your lost wallet would have "represented" Bitcoins and USD cash equally (I mean you store them BOTH in "cold paper wallet" formats), you would not be able to claim any advantages of having/using BTC at all.**
Also yet, consider the bigger scale scenario of not a physical loss (such as your wallet), but a "digital loss" (such as hacking incident). In this case, you will still recover and replace everything related to your credit/debit/bank accounts/cards, just by making calls, but **who do you call to deal with your Bitcoin losses**?
To conclude, as of today, all our BTC possessions, in my opinion, are as vulnerable as were those $150 from OP's lost wallet.

I mean, that Bitcoins are stuck at MtGox is a known fact, so there is no need to prove that.

Well, when MtGox support themselves recommended to do the same sh.t with fiat withdrawals, there was an option to withdraw via BTC (that's what I had to do loooong time ago). But right now the advice like that (especially coming from support) sound completely crazy, **because there is no other option remaining**.

It doesn't say anywhere that bidders will actually know what are the highest bids at any moment -&gt; "*... In order for your bid to be considered by the USMS, you must send a signed pdf copy of the Bid Form...*". This means you put your bid, you sign the form and you send it in. So, this is pretty much a "blind auction", in other words, by definition it is not an auction.
My prediction is that the **winning bid will be well above the market price** and the winner will be some entity or an individual planning to hold bitcoins long term.

@_date: 2014-05-17 06:46:07
I would be hesitant to call for an expectation of a "big run", but I feel fairly confident that at minimum price will hold more or less steadily at the levels where we are now (some $430 to $450) and it definitely does not want to drop lower.
It means that I'd say it is probably ok at this point to hold Bitcoins (which have not been doing for the past about 4 months).

If I go and make a purchase, I will know the address I spend to and I can then follow where this payment went after that. That secondary address will be the one "to watch".

@_date: 2014-02-09 05:24:40
Well, why don't you sell and wait till price is stable? You don't risk more that you already do, as both fiat and BTC cannot be taken out. So, you can buy BTC whenever they allow for withdrawals.

@_date: 2014-02-23 14:06:08
It may look like some failure, but I think people need to account for a fact that withdrawals from exchangers are not always instant, regardless of the amount. This is their security precaution (keeping low amounts in the hot wallet) and in my opinion they should keep things that way.
The only guaranteed way to make purchase like you are describing, is to have Bitcoins in your own wallet and send them from there at the time of purchase. I made many purchases from merchants who uses BitPay and can say that my transactions are going through pretty much in an instant. That is, BitPay does not wait even for the first confirmation, but only for appearance of transaction in the blockchain.
I guess the only argument, which can be made here regarding CoinBase setup, is that they claim to be an online wallet, therefore one would indeed expect them to process transactions instantly, at all times. It does looks like in this respect BlockChain.info wallets are more functional, because people are keeping their keys, and their coins are actually available for sending any time.

It is not "panic", it is price correction (Bitcoin value grew some 6,000%+ in less than a year).
It is NOT (!!!) because of this particular announcement ( but because MtGox is showing clear signs of being insolvent in general. This announcement is just a drop in the ocean of their load of bad news. 
Plus, MtGox CEO being nowhere to find (while being Bitcoin Foundation Board member), possibly being wanted in Silk Road investigation. 
Plus, Apple removing the last Bitcoin related app from their store (not wanting to deal with Bitcoin's uncertain legal status). 
Plus, older news on Feds making it absolutely clear that Bitcoin must be very tightly regulated (which is against the Bitcoin's very design). 
Plus, recent arrest of another Bitcoin Foundation member Charlie Shrem for his possible involvement in Silk Road.
Plus, Russia banning Bitcoin usage.

**2.** In lieu of latest definitive push from Feds on Bitcoin Regulations, with supporting that push notion on heavy Bitcoin use for money laundering, Apple simply wants to get out of anything related to Bitcoin, to just stay away, just in case.

Every single bitcoin received by them and exchanged to dollars, is bought by someone for dollars. It is essentially a zero sum set of transactions and I am not sure why you think it will decrease the value of bitcoin. Also, higher/growing trading volumes across the whole Bitcoin market is a  very good indication of bitcoin valuation and therefore is a **positive impact** (it is the opposite of what you are saying).

It is not about the fraction, this part is obvious, It may be about the fact of it.

You got **detailed** answer within 10 minutes? This is just horrible and I am dead serious saying this. It has to mean that there are practically no users in the system, so the support has nothing else to do, but write "detailed answers" (...and perhaps "working" on Reddit ;o). I have no clue who might be trading on Kraken, but my best guess is that those few 0.001 BTC trades you see on the site are probably a product of a few bots trading between themselves. I also cannot believe I see a spread of about 10 points right now (this is nonsense).
The fact is, trading volume here is extremely low and the worse part is that it has been **exactly like that** since the last time I checked, some 3 - 4 months ago. 
It appears that Kraken's business is not developing whatsoever. This is especially bad because apparently Kraken creator **Jesse Powell, has no clue how to advance, innovate and promote the system**. Current users, even if they decide to stay, probably should not expect anything good coming from a "leader" like that, especially since the guy apparently "likes to jump the ship" (check the most recent Ripple story).
P.S. Is OP and those commenting positively are all from Kraken support team? Bored huh?

Soviets lost some 30 million lives just during WW2 (for comparison, Americans lost 0.4 mln) and this translates to the fact that pretty much every single family living today in Russia has lost someone during the war.

Sorry, wrong comparison for where things stand as of today. For a real life scenario, you must account for exchanger's fees on two ends as well. A person on one end (sender) must pay fiat deposit + Bitcoin purchase fee AND the person on the other end (receiver) must pay Bitcoin to fiat selling fee + fiat withdrawal fee. 
Out of curiosity, I compared a $2,000 transfer cost using Bitcoin vs. WesternUnion between US and a couple of other countries with good banking systems. WU is cheaper about 3 times. If you look at single transfers of big volumes, like hundreds of thousand dollars, a single $50 flat bank wire fee, is nothing in comparison to % based fees you would have to pay on two ends and losses you will have in relation to exchanging such amounts of Bitcoins on the open market.

“I’m a BTC fan,” he writes. “I understand the value of the system as a .zip file for wealth. But Bitcoin has an image problem. Its followers see themselves as freedom fighters, attacking outsiders with vengeance and talking up their own accomplishments in the language of the already victorious,” Biggs writes, noting the sense of arrogant inevitability coming from confident Bitcoin supporters. Biggs notes that Bitcoin chat forums, such as the one on Reddit are packed with “endlessly effusive, crowing that this cafe is accepting bitcoin and this dentist is filling cavities for bitcoin. These slight wins are literally meaningless, as important to the future of bitcoin as their decision to stock a certain type of Roma syrup. These incremental hoots make it seem like bitcoin is growing. It isn’t, at least not in a global sense.

Knowing a bit this sub, I can tell you that you are probably going to get a lot of comments in line with "you should have followed public reports on major MtGox issues and left Gox long time ago (...like most of the Bitcoin community did), while you could do it in a more or less timely manner". However, I hope after reading this particular comment people will show some compassion and avoid repeating the obvious.


I guess you just made the first step in bringing public's attention by posting here, because the issue like this is by far not unique in nature.
MtGox is definitely like a fast ticking time bomb of negativity explosion, while most people including the main stream media are keeping ignoring the fact of it.

@_date: 2014-01-19 22:09:35
You see, there are actually two issues here, related to MtGox and never decreasing price gap actually proves them.
First, you cannot withdraw fiat from MtGox, they simply don't do it and there is nothing one can do about it. Most people, who are into more or less sizable Bitcoin trading know about withdrawals issue and they simply do not deal with MtGox at all. The only **FEW people** who trade on MtGox, are those very new to Bitcoin and even them, once they find out about the issues, are shortly leaving MtGox.This brings up the second issue and a question:
If heavy traders do not use MtGox, then where the volume shown on all charts is coming from? The answer has to be is that most trades which MtGox is reporting, are simply **fake** and are created by MtGox's own software bots. If one watches closely MtGox trading activity, it becomes noticeable that trading patterns are mostly FOLLOWING those on other exchangers, albeit **with the slight "uptrend drive" (thus the price gap &lt;--!!!)**. There were several reports here on Reddit about strange looking (highly repetitive), bot-like trading patterns on MtGox, so people ARE noticing fake MtGox trades. 
Why MtGox is faking trading? Must be because MtGox themselves own a lot of Bitcoins since very early days, so they are simply selling them off whenever they can. In other words, most of the fiat that comes in (from newly coming into field users) simply "stays" there. What comes out are pretty much the Bitcoins only (mostly those originally owned by MtGox). This situation will probably not change until MtGox either gets busted by some authorities, or until they actually sell off all of their own Bitcoins.
P.S. This is all just an opinion only, based on own reasoning and observations.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:52:22
I really like when new merchants capable of selling for Bitcoins are coming in packs of thousands (instead of one by one). In other words, it is a lot more efficient when some payment processors, already serving many merchants are adding Bitcoin to THEIR methods of payments, thus automatically engaging all of them in one "strike". Good news.

@_date: 2014-01-31 22:44:35
The reality and time can prove otherwise, but at the moment, I really do not think that CEO's decision to publicize his newly established ownership of $millions (plural) worth of Bitcoins, presents him in a good light as the company leader in the eyes of regular shareholders. Of course one CAN have high risk investments in their portfolio, but one then has to have $billions to allow for $milions for such high risk investment allocation. 
A lot of people  (shareholders of all scopes in particular) do not know enough about Bitcoins, and they will of course search for information on Bitcoins. What will appear to their "fresh look", is a load of huge scale illegal activities, related to that arrests, bans and warnings on Bitcoin usage at the International level and the last but not least, an enormous "bubble" (from their perspective) in Bitcoin price value. Again, the reality and time may prove otherwise, but as of right now, there is no way that "regular" investors can possibly see a "commodity" (Bitcoin) which have grown about 6,000% (six thousand) in the past year as a wise investment. 
For any outsider, such "investment" can only be seen as a huge risk gambler's move and this is exactly what Overstock.com CEO publicly said he did.  What are their thoughts? **What kind of craziness has gotten into the mind of the CEO of a company I invested in?**

China Halts Bank Cash Transfers
13 comments, 1 called-out

The People’s Bank of China , the central bank, has just ordered commercial banks to halt cash transfers.
This notice, for instance, appears on the online portal for Citigroup's C -2.74% Citibank unit for its China customers:
Important Notice:
1. Due to the system maintenance of People’s Bank of China, Domestic RMB Fund Transfer through Citibank (China) Online and Citi Mobile will be delayed during January 30th 2014, 16:00pm to February 2nd 2014, 18:30pm. As to the fund availability at the receiving bank, it depends on the processing requirements and turnaround time of the receiving bank. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

2. During Spring Festival, Foreign Currency Transfer Transaction through Citibank (China) Online and Citi Mobile will be temporally not available from January 30, 2014 18:00pm to February 7, 2014 09:00am. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
If you have any enquiries, please reach us via our 24-hour banking hotline at 800-830-1880 or credit card hotline at 400-821-1880. If you are calling from other parts of the world, please reach us at 86-20-38801267 for banking services or 86-21-38969500 for credit card services.
In short, there will be a three-day suspension of domestic renminbi transfers.  There will also be a suspension, spanning nine calendar days, of conversions of renminbi to foreign currency.
The specific reason given—“system maintenance” at the central bank—is preposterous.  It is not credible that during the highest usage period in the year—the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday beginning January 31—the central bank would schedule an upgrade and shut down cash transfers. 
A better explanation is that the country’s banking system is running dry.  Yes, there is an increased need for money in the run-up to and during the Lunar New Year holiday, but that is only a small factor.  After all, central bank officials knew this spike in demand was coming—it occurs every year at this time—and a core function of central banks is to manage seasonal liquidity fluctuations.  Moreover, the holiday has not started yet, and the PBOC, as that institution is known, could have added more liquidity to meet cash needs.
So what’s really going on?  This crunch follows similar incidents in June and December of last year.  In June, for instance, the central bank used the excuse of a “system upgrade” to allow banks to shut down their ATMs and online banking platforms.  As a result, they conserved cash and thereby avoided a nationwide meltdown. 
So today’s “system maintenance” notice is a sign of a fundamental problem.  Banks, in short, need cash to rollover ever-increasing amounts of nonperforming loans and wealth management products.  This month, cash needs are even higher than normal because of the impending default of the Credit Equals Gold wealth product scheduled for January 31.  Analysts are worried that the failure, if it occurs, will cause a China-wide panic.
Perhaps more important, the Federal Open Market Committee is holding its next meeting on January 28-29 so there could be an announcement on the 29th on the trimming of bond purchases.  The suspension of FX transactions means that speculators will not be able to dump renminbi and buy dollars.  Fed Chair Bernanke’s words on tapering, beginning in May of last year, shook emerging markets.  A FOMC announcement this time could undermine China, especially because of the darkening perceptions about that country.
Pundits, pointing to the nation’s $3.82 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, are fond of saying that Beijing has enough money to weather any situation.  Yet China does not have a foreign currency crisis.  It has a domestic currency one where dollars, euros, pounds, and yen are not much use. 
Banks are evidently scrambling for cash.  They have, in the past, resorted to desperate maneuvers at the ends of calendar quarters to meet regulatory requirements.  The current crunch is even more alarming because it cannot be occurring for quarter-end reasons.
Something is very wrong in China at the moment.  Banks’ apparent need to conserve cash, coming just weeks after the last incident, looks ominous.

I do not see any negativity here. They heard the comments and have official replies and perhaps just need more time. It actually makes sense that whatever "materials" they used to create their original Bitlicense proposal, may be not sufficient or is not quite accurate (thus, unreasonable draft) . Therefore no point of releasing what they have, but take time to gather more info for new proposal.
Overall, it looks more like a good news as NYDFS is perhaps backing up to an extend and likely will not be as hard second time around.

Good points and I can relate to them a lot. I made a mistake once by purchasing a phone wich was neither iOS, nor Android, just for the phone's own features. I shortly found it rather shocking and VERY unreasonable of developers, to provide iOS or Android apps only and NOTHING on their own website. I could access websites and could have used their software. It never settled with me to understand as to why do these developers (most of them in fact) are missing on regular website traffic clients. 
People are accessing Internet hell knows from what kind of devices, so why not do the obvious and start from web based application first and only THEN, for the sake of extra convenience, for those who want it, add your iOS and Android apps. Such apps should have NEVER been the primary software products of ANY developer. And by the way, if this approach and the way of thinking was happening long ago, it would have put a lot more pressure on Apple to be more flexible and forth coming with their apps store.

The common way around such lack of resources is severe punishment of just a few "on public", so that the rest can see what could happen if they keep going, so they mostly stop. Good example of this is DUI (driving under influence), which is presently a serious crime. It was not a big deal a while back. Being drunk while committing something bad, was even used as an excuse to soften the responsibility.

Miners and end users are not money transmitters was an obvious thing, but I guess it is now officially documented and that is good.
I guess a lot bigger blow to Bitcoin movement, which comes from the latest hearing, is that feds made it absolutely clear that there must be a full blown regulation of Bitcoin usage in US (exactly the same thing as what is happening in regular banks) and that in turn will create complete transparency of all transactions made by those using Bitcoins as payment. It is this part, which seem to **come in full contradiction to the basic principals of Bitcoin, pitched to everybody since early days, which are decentralization and privacy**.
In fact, in US, if the acquisition of Bitcoins by end users becomes regulated in a way that Feds will (for sure) force it to be, then the use of Bitcoins becomes actually a lot worse than the use of cash, in terms of personal privacy. 
**Please compare:**
**A**. When you take cash and spend it, no one knows where you spent it (assuming you are not under some sort of surveillance). 
**B**. When you take Bitcoins, your address is recorded, it is available to "regulating authority" and all of your future spends can be seen on a public ledger (by definition) without even the need of a warrant.
**The reality check:** The ONLY reason Joe Fiat (average person) HAS BEEN spending cash buying Bitcoins, is to sell it back to exchanger at a lot higher price to pocket profit IN CASH. She/He, at this point in time, could not care less about technology/innovation or any promises about (still imaginary) conveniences in the future, as this would be something very much against human nature.

Well, "other ways" could be some legal actions, of which we might be not even aware. What we do know for instance is that MtGox's US bank account which was used/connected to their Dwolla account was seized by US authorities and I did not see information anywhere about what is the current status of all that. Another legal matter with no updates on the current status against MtGox, is the law suite filed by CoinLabs (which supposed to take over US customers from Gox).

True to a great degree. The store where this is planned is very central, there are a lot of people passing by and usually a lot of visitors from different parts of US, as well as the world.

It is probably not the fault of people who are getting stuck, they are mostly new on the market. The main stream media keeps referring to MtGox, so naturally, people are going there until they discover issues first hand.
I honestly do not believe that ANY of the old-timers are dealing with MtGox. Only those who managed to play out the arbitrage (Japan Yen withdrawls, which are BTW now also slow).

The phrase "...BitPay will compute the volume-weighted average price of bitcoin over the previous 24-hour period.." is the phrase that most attracted my attention as well. Frankly, this is shocking.
It means that salary payment recipients are absolutely NOT guaranteed that they will get what they earned, even if they prompted to get paid 100% in fiat. It is so, because **the chance of 24 hour average being accurately reflective of the employee wages is very low**.

New people are indirectly being referred to MtGox by the main stream media. Whenever there is some Bitcoin coverage, MtGox is always mentioned, so they assume "the oldest and the bigest" is the one they'd go to.

I am really glad that community now realizes that MtGox is at the moment one hell of a liability for everyone and that this issue comes to light instead of being kept shuffled "under the rug".
The only way to alert public, is via main stream media. It is in fact them who keeps referring to MtGox, whenever there is Bitcoin related coverage. It is mostly such referring by the media that brings in new people to MtGox, until they learn about issues, the hard way.
I don't think any old-timers are dealing with MtGox. Their clientele is new people, plus those few who are knowingly taking the risk in doing arbitrage.

I guess they probably looked at enormous volatility of Bitcoin, then saw your transfers are going **both ways**. They then concluded you are a gambler (from their perspective), therefore can potentially blow all your savings and then would have nothing to pay your mortgage with.
I wonder what is going to happen if bank sees **ONLY** incoming payments related to Bitcoin (like from CoinBase for instance) and never withdrawals. Would the bank notice these deposits in any negative way (in particular if mortgage application is under review for instance)? ...What do you think?

You still didn't get it! Check out the term "daytrading". Absolute majority of trades you see on the charts, is the result of daytrading activity. This means that people and organization who daytrade must have funds/coins available at the exchanger at all times, up to the point when they decide to stop day-trading. Daytraders are THE market makers.

Why the F. OP has to own every bitcoin of Gox???
I am averaging things up. Add some flexibility to your thinking. 7% of entire Bitcoin supply is stolen via MtGox. That means everyone's losses directly related to those of MtGox's ARE part of that 7%. Simple as that.

Wouldn't this make the process of buying goods very NOT user friendly? Something is wrong here. Merchant MUST deal with the method of payment they accept and be knowledgeable about it.
You are basically saying that it is ok to go load the cart with groceries, then leave the store, go to the bank, make payment in the bank and only then go back to the store and pick up your groceries. &lt;--- This is apparently how TigerDirect has Bitcoin payments set up at the moment. Moreover, apparently this example's bank payment actually did not get through and this groceries buyer now needs to go back to the bank again to clear the issue, which is what you are suggesting.

I guess recording is like having witness (if the voice of other party is heard as well), but what I meant, was to formally tell your buyer that he cannot use the coins for anything illegal. 
Now a fully separate issue is that these arrests are reminding people selling Bitcoins that they are functioning as money transmitters, which is illegal if there is no license.

No, you are NOT money transmitter and neither are your customers, per this document (... and a common sense).
If you mine exclusively for your customers, you are a business providing the service which people are buying from you. **You yourself and your business are in fact not even miners**, in the same way as your hardware makers, or a data center, both of which are not miners. Even the fact that you are probably taking fees for your service in bitcoins does NOT make you a miner. This is again the same as by selling goods for Bitcoins, Overstock.com is not a miner.
Miners are actually all of your customers. If you mine for yourself as well, then you are a customer of your own business and **only from this perspective** you are then a miner too.

I think this is the wrong public to even dare to say that there are some technical issues. To say at THIS point in time, after years of operations, that **they cannot code automatic withdrwals of BTC properly(?)** is simply an insult of people's intelligence. 
They are lying, they have been lying for a long time !!! How much longer will public tolerate this shit? 
No value traders are using MtGox, only newcomers due to the lack of knowledge about issues. MtGox is clearly running trading bots to fake the trading volume. MtGox is a burden for everyone.

This absolutely must be the case. In earlier days, when the price was under $100 all that was needed is an email address to open account and buy BTC in any amount. Not verified customers could withdraw $10,000 per month.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:18:27
I don't know what are you talking about. The exchange structure is simple: There is Bitcoin total and there is fiat total, All deposited by system users, who trade with each other. If nothing is stolen and every single user withdraws, everything will match down to a total zero. Exchanger's profit is the fees users paid while trading.
Exchange solvency has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin price, even if the price becomes zero.

My feeling is that this will not be an auction open to general public due to the lack of solid "regulations". Most likely, "they" will approach financial institutions, including investment firms, because in this case the Government will be able to "regulate" the thing on a case by case basis. If there will be positive interest among such institutions (there is got to be, at least some...), and public WILL know about it, the value of Bitcoin will probably go up.
Simple "dump" on the open market is very not likely...

I've had this problem a few times, but it was not only with BTC-e in my case, as I use Google Authenticate at a few places. **Try to restart your phone (or whatever your gadget is)**. My best guess, is that if the phone is not online for a while, the phone's code probably gets out of sync with central servers. In my case, my codes were not working at more than one place, so this is how I knew that it was not the website's problem, but mine (my phones). Restarting the phone, solved the problem right then for me.
Also make sure you are not "overtrying", or you may get locked out of the account for multiple not successful login attempts. If it doesn't work a couple of times, look for tech issues, such as the one I described above.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:12:30
It all depends what is it exactly that you are referring to, as your online wallet. 
For example, if you deposit to some exchange platform, you will see your BTC balance on your internal account and the money are all yours, regardless of what happened with the original wallet you sent your Bitcoins to. 
Exchangers keep their Bitcoins in "cold" wallets, so they are moving all received funds there and they are suppose to do that for security purposes. The same goes for other "Online wallets".
If this "online wallet" is yours for sure and the one you are told to send Bitcoins from, then something is definitely wrong and your Bitcoins may have been stolen somehow.
@_date: 2014-09-13 06:56:38

Russian authorities did not think it through too well when they say "Bitcoin is a money substitute".
No one claims a proposal to ditch Rubles and have Bitcoin instead. Bitcoin can be easily seen alone with any other currency in the world, right there on the list: Euros, Yens, US Dollars, Bitcoin, et.c..
In fact, they are circulating all these foreign currencies WITHIN GENERAL POPULATION, but do not see the problem with that. Besides Rubles, all banks have at least Euro and USD accounts offered to any and all regular citizens. If they say that the only money in the country is Rubles, they contradict themselves, because Bitcoin usage in essence is not that much different from any of the foreign currency usage.
Warning of the public about high risk of Bitcoin related value loss IS however a valid one and it would be absurd to argue against that.

I don't know why does the thread title presented in some negative way ("...not so fast"). When I first heard of this transaction, it was understood immediately that the dealer did not actually held any bitcoins, but rather converted them to dollars immediately. 
Any decent merchant, especially the big one, with high volume sales, simply cannot afford to add the Bitcoin volatility factor to their business model.
The fact of buying the car for bitcoins however of course stays and it is a positive one for bitcoin technology overall, because the person purchasing it, indeed spent bitcoins, skipping all of the **"traditional" banking hassles**.

The downvoting and burring of the information is indeed the issue seriously standing on the way for getting the complete picture.

Once again, you are saying, price must be going up right now and this sale is an attempt to prevent that.
One can argue with this: This sale comes from someone who sees price being artificially held for the past week or so (thus manipulated) and that this manipulation is not likely to continue, especially building the uptrend.

Coinbase needs to introduce maximum in fees per transaction, or at least progressively lower fees for higher amounts. If they do so, buying and selling bitcoins can be used as fast and simple money transfer between serviced countries and this will be a direct and (for a change) real competition to the behemoth establishments such as Western Union . Right now the fee is way too high for such transfers.

**Did anybody notice that the same type of dip, at about the same time, happened on BTC-e as well?** Just as on Bitfinex, price on BTC-e dropped to the exact same level of $100. 
The two platforms are not connected to each other in any way and this means it was likely one person selling (stupidly) on both sites, possibly with the limit order of $100. 
If these were real trades, why then they are referred to as some glitches? This is very tough, very volatile market alright...
I am saying this because I am concerned that Bitfinex might be putting itself in a hole, by crediting of sorts, and letting users to get accustomed to the feeling that when they make WRONG trading decisions, they have a chance to "undo" them at Bitfinex ... 
I also know for a fact that at BTC-e this same "dip" went through as just "wow" and no one was whining.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:59:42
Do you feel there is a severe lack of bitcoin supporters right now? Do you feel that technology is not good enough to be self advertising?

This cannot be the reason, What makes you think real businesses were ever holding on to Bitcoins, This would be plain STUPID for any decent business, to get a load of something THAT volatile as bitcoins. Even if some holding was taking place, it could not have been on large scale.

My BTX account will be linked to my own Bitstamp (and others) accounts, not to yours, correct?
Also and importantly, If I sell BTC and have USD on my account, can use that balance to trade (buy Bitcoins) on other linked exchanges? I am asking here about a conversion of Bitstamp USD to BTC-e USD for example. If not, **will you consider using Ripple network to accomplish such "conversions"** (it will be very easy to implement for you and Bitstamp is already using Ripple).
Lastly, any plans to ADD Bitfinex (this is very high volume exchange)?

The value changes as the btc/usd rates are changing, but it absolutely can be locked. If your goal is to get/send/receive/deposit/withdraw a defined amount of BTC, just set default to BTC, go on with your transaction and it will be processed in the exact amount of BTC you want. Your USD in this case will vary. The same is true for the other way around, when you want to deal with fixed amount of USD.

Actually, From what I've read, they did some kind of promotion where traders making higher trading volume (supposedly to combat volatility) will get bonuses. Bonuses do come on top of the fees, but I guess total in fees is less than total in bonuses, so there is profit.
Apparently, someone just set the trading bot and simply run it back and forth simply to get that bonus/fees profit.

Also, (and importantly !!!), regarding your "progressively more optimistic" conclusion: Based on the plot collage you put together, perhaps it is too early to say that the 3rd bubble has already went through its full cycle. 
Look at the time point, which is labeled "We Are Here" and then extrapolate that down to previous two bubbles. Both of them showed a lot more of the down trend from that point on. It could mean that **the current bubble's cycle is NOT DONE with its "post-crash" yet.**

I don't think one can practically do that, even if $1 Billion is put to action. The moment one starts to buy BTC in big quantities, the price will start to increase indefinitely.

It is all very simple, but please do not build your sand castles too high.
1 - Your business wants to accept Bitcoins because:
1a - Once it does, it will get free advertisement of your business to the huge Bitcoin community. If your products/services are any good, you WILL get a boost in sales, nearly guaranteed.
1b - No decent businessmen should EVER expose his/her business to the enormous volatility of Bitcoin price. Therefore, you need to communicate to your superiors that they will NOT need to even touch Bitcoins, because services like BitPay and CoinBase offer a practically complete removal of businesses from exposure to Bitcoin volatility when receiving the orders. Your business will receive the exact amount in USD as they are regularly selling.
1c - Accepting Bitcoin as payments should bring in savings on transaction fees, which businesses are typically paying for the ability to accept credit cards (merchant fees).
1d - Payments your business receives via Bitcoins are 100% guaranteed, as there is NO possibility of a charge back by your customers. 
2 -  Unless you are having very hard time finding a way to spend the income you are generating (your income is huge), your 20 -40% allocation of it to Bitcoin is the **dumbest thing a person can do with the needed money**. Investment in Bitcoins, especially at this point in time, is the highest risk venture imaginable and those who are doing it, MUST honestly say that they are fully prepared to lose up to 100% of such investment.

I fly very often, so just like you, I run several sites. I pick the cheapest price and get my ticket. Sometimes it happens to be the site that accepts Bitcoin, sometimes it is not. It is all random.
This has absolutely NOTHING to do with Bitcoin and CheapAir (for instance) could not care less how exactly you purchased your tickets from them since BitPay converts BTCs to fiat for them on the spot (same end result for CheapAir, regardless of payment method). Sites selling plane tickets compete with each other on the border of $10 - $20 depending on the flight. Pick a different destination and date and you will see different layout.

The Bitcoin idea/protocol use by any organization that deals with payments is actually an expected and a logical thing to do. Any such organization (banks, payment processors retail stores) can easily implement their own internal funds transfer system, "centralized" by themselves.

Did anyone have this same issue with Chase, while dealing exclusively with CoinBase (a US based company)? My feeling is that they are probably fine with CoinBase, because if anything happens, they have someone "next dour" to point fingers to.

This is all true in reality, but you pointed it yourself, from legal perspective, this whole ordeal is turning out to be some unregistered, unregulated "funbank in Japan", therefore for the judge, whatever happened inside is of no concern. The strongest argument here s that being a funbank, MtGox had no right to accept the deposit on the first place. A judge simply is looking at two obvious things: 1. Person made a deposit. 2. Same person cannot get ANYTHING out. Judgement: give the original deposit back to this person.

It is definitely a mess, but it is not that confusing and here is the way to look at it: 
Gox USD is (and was) actually worth ZERO in real (withdrawable) USD, However, before they halted BTC withdrawals, market (sort of arbitrary) put a value of about 1/0.8 (meaning that one could buy $1,000 worth of BTC, on MtGox, withdraw BTC and sell it for about $800 on other exchange).
AFTER they halted BTC withdrawals, GoxUSD now **really** became zero of real USD and GoxBTC/realBTC ratio became 160/600 (as of right now). Note that it is again market's determination that GoxBTC is worth about $160 and this is a pure hope value. Real value of GoxBTC right now is zero...

As there are several websites displaying the trading (and some other data) and they are all using the same sources (from exchanger), it would be visible if one of such sites will falsify the data in any significant way. 
**In other words, charting sites are essentially auditors of each other**, so...
I personally would have more concerns about the trading data, which comes from exchangers themselves. Manipulation at THAT level is a lot harder to check. For instance, it is very unlikely that any higher scale trader would deal with MtGox these days, due to their major withdrawal issues (not only fiat is taken "hostage", but now BTC as well). Yet, MtGox keeps telling the world via their API about huge trading volumes daily. Neither price of MtGox, not the spreads make sense...

I did not understand this on the first place, why would ANYone accepting bitcoin via guaranteeing third party (BitPay, Coinbase...) want to stop doing it. No need at all to get involved with bitcoin volatility, if one doesn't want to; Merchants are getting the exact sales price they want in fiat; they are getting money in the bank the next or the same day; unlike with credit cards, their payment is guaranteed and it costs them less in trxn fees.

I am not sure... In your example, the water dam (the block) and solar panels are completely independent from one another. Your panels are not contributing to the dam, but to something else downstream (the grid).
Haw about this, let's stick to the water dam analogy and yes, we call it a block. The river which flows through the dam is a flow of transactions, but let's say that the water dam is some "water control facility" (as in - miners are checking for transactions validity) which allows for the river to flow through, **but NOT over it!**. If water flows over the dam, let's agree that this is a disaster which we can't allow to happen as there is a small village right under the dam. Our water dam of course has a certain capacity to account for some "seasonal" changes in the river's water flow. So, what will lightning do to help the dam to prevent the spill over in case when the river, for some reason, fills up the dam?

I believe in what I see. SegWit2x fork is happening, it is a fact and everything is moving to the new blockchain: The hash power, merchants accepting bitcoin, the name Bitcoin and ticker BTC. Segwit2x becomes Bitcoin and the outside world may not even notice much of a change, but the only condition in my opinion for all this to go through smoothly, is if Bitcoin Core team submits to SegWit2x, or else they are just getting effectively fired, while leaving scorched earth for everybody else behind them.

Wait, I am counting chains. Core will need to make another fork to add the EDA thingy, so that their chain won't just die out in one strike (due to current difficulty while probably having a drop in hash power as miners move to 2x). Is that 5 chains in total then?

So, if for the period of mining 2016 blocks the average time per block comes to , let's say, 6 minutes, the difficulty will increase accordingly?

So, this is basically a decision to go wherever the hash power goes. But then, is anything planned at all to do for the legacy chain to overcome the mining difficulty it will be facing once the hash power shifts? IF legacy chain will retain some 10% of hash power, the block times will be 10 hours + instead of 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:55:45
So, will then both block size and a second layer need to scale in the future, or just the second layer (people on this very thread are saying Bitcoin with segwit can already scale to Visa levels)? I guess this is where their "1Mb block size bottleneck" argument comes in. 
Also, are the "drivechains, MAST, etc;..." a sort of third layers?
EDIT: thanks for answering by the way.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:01:43
It is not clear to me at all either, thus this thread. 
- Miners' hash power looks like a "big gun", considering that sustainability of legacy chain fully depends on it, is it?
- Bitpay's support of SegWit2x seems to be yet the "biggest gun", because this means **adoption**. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:26:15


This probably depends on the percentage of hash power reduction (IF that happens). In the latest fork the initial new blocks took some 10+ hours and something like that is probably not a good thing for the heavily used blockchain, no?


Isn't the block size increase requires hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:19:54
Nodes don't mine blocks while miners do and 95% of them are signalling for SegWit2x.

Since you already made your choice to not deal with all of that cumbersome stuff like using virgin, off-line computer, paper wallets, downloading, installing things, the short answer to your question, in your situation is Yes, they will be safe, you do own your coins, since you do have your private keys, So, for the piece of mind of not messing something up, do nothing if you are satisfied with Blockchain.info so far.
If there is anything you need to do, you'll be notified by Blockchain.info and you can also watch their blog: 
P.S. My only possible concern about SegWit2x forking impact, is if after the fork, one will be able to move coins FROM the original chain at all, regardless of the type of wallet one's coins are stored in. If movable (that is, if at least some mining will continue), how long it may possibly take and how expensive in fees this might be at that time. The reason for this concern is because new blocks mining speed will significantly drop at a time of the forking event, which means that if no new blocks are mined in a reasonably timely manner, all new transactions will be affected accordingly.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:58:50
Somehow, I don't think so. Each next block records ALL transactions across the whole network on a "per time" basis. Then this block is added to the previous block with transactions information for previous time period and so on. We have to have blocks keep coming at all times, for the system to function.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:46:24

They are saying segwit slows down the "transactions per second" rate by about a factor of two for any block size. Is there any truth to that?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:27:26
From what we have seen happened with BCH fork, some 10% power produced initial blocks at some 10+ hours per block rate, with very significant deviation. This is not a good projection for the legacy chain at all. Also yes, how different exchanges handle the ticker is in fact yet another potentially strong factor of uncertainties to be added to this existing and still maturing mess. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:40:23
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:10:56
How can it be the same if it is already known that over 90% of miners on which legacy chain is 100% dependent right now will be leaving. Based on BCH fork experience, some 10% power = 10 Hours + block times and I am not reading anywhere about the solution to this yet. It means that there might be actually nothing to even compare SegWit2x chain to, isn't this right?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:49:34
I posted the answer, which is, blocks will keep coming with zero reward (you are probably looking at the post via "messages"). Yes, hard to say what is the environment going to be like, at that point. Overall, I just wanted to know what is there in the protocol from technical point of view. So, all good :o)
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:59:00
Tech noob question: For Bitcoin mining protocol **does it always absolutely have to be a predefined number of zeros at the front** for block to be solved, or is it just a number of characters in a bigger string? Can one mine for "vanity hash"? Did anyone count zeros in the hashes posted above...?
From math perspective, it is my understanding that one can simply "pre-input" ANY string of numbers and letters at ANY position of the bigger string and then set such string as a "target" for mining. For as long as the number of "target" characters is the same as whatever is currently set for those zeros, the difficulty will stay the same, no?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:17:18
Well, the thing is, the maximum total number of coins is actually not an absolutely fixed amount. That number, is the value to which the system will be infinitely approaching, through infinite halving of the rewards. So there always be mining rewards, but they will be just getting tiny. **The technical problem I see there, is when reward gets to the value less than 1 Satishi.**
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:15:36


Are these people aware  about the fact that the chain they want to stay on, may no longer grow at all?
P.S. I personally feel that it is very unfortunate that the good old "theme" of being happy about Bitcoin global adoption as payment system, almost fully converted these days into a "store-of-value" theme.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:04:38
I was talking about it in general terms, not about this particular case for 148 at the end. Other than that, from math point of view it doesn't matter which specific target symbols are "looked for" in a pool of long strings of random numbers and letter. Probability of finding 18 zeros at the beginning is the same as for any other target 18 characters, anywhere withing the string. The fact is though, that (at least for the old BTC chain...), a goal of finding the zeros in the leading end for a reward, is part of the protocol.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:12:31


They ARE doing it ( and they are "taking" everything built on the original chain, including Bitcoin name, trading Ticker BTC, adoption merchants, 95% of hash power. They become Bitcoin to an external viewer. The coins on the original chain will probably even become not movable at all, due to "chocking" on mining difficulty.

@_date: 2017-08-02 00:22:57


Just to grasp the basic concept of this, without getting too technical:  Is "water flow" analogy not applicable here? I am asking because this is how I see it at the moment and it means that (assuming water is not compressible) only "this much" of water can "spill over" into second layer. Or would you say that a scaling second layer is like a water pump with some "pressure sensor" and it would suck out of a block as much as needed to "equalize" the "pressure"?


So, are they to be "attached" (so to speak) to the main chain, sort of like segwit, but separately from it? ...sort of the secondary (or additional) second layers? ... like a bunch of padlocks hanging on a bridge fence?
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:30:50
BitPay is doing what they are doing (right or wrong), but how do I interpret your comment in respect to what Coinbase position might be? They must chose and announce, unless they want to deal with both chains Segwit1x and SegWit2x (unlikely). Do you think Coinbase will go with High Hash Power (SegWit2x), or Low Hash Power (SegWit1x)?
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:33:13
Correct my reasoning please. I see this as if something is done very much backwards. Something is ready to broadcast from space, yet the use of that something "on the ground" is not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:21:33
There always will be coins to mine, but through halving events, the rewards will be tiny . The problem is, what is going to happen when the "next" reward is less than 1 Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:26:01
Or..., the other chain secretly modified the protocol to allow the reward not only for "finding" a string with a bunch of zeros in the front, but for any pre-set character at any pre-set position on the string. If this is done, then probability and therefore difficulty will not change.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:29:20

Good point OP, up-voted and I personally do like broader introduction/usage of the term  millibitcoin. Simply because it just makes sense.

In biology labs microliters are a lot more common even than milliliters (micro is 1/1,000,000). Heard of "nanotechnology"? This is already 1/Billion'th world...

I see people are talking about **"technical debt"** mentioned in the article. **What does it refers to?**
The way I took it (not being a tech person) is that perhaps when a number of changes to the protocol are made over time, such changes are relatively "bulky" (coding wise), because the older protocol needs to have some extra "conditioning" code (so to speak) for new changes to take effect. So, in a case when the next needed change would absolutely have to be done via hard fork, one might as well go back to the whole collection of prior (bulky) changes and "clean" their code up. In other words, "technical debt" is a collection of prior protocol changes that can be re-introduced in "cleaner" way when opportunity presents itself. Is this about right, or am I inventing thing here?.

You see, the issue here is that PayPal is known to be a "hack-heaven" for fraudsters who would steal people's accounts and then try to exchange to something like Bitcoin, which is not reversible.

Besides the fact that you just witnessed first hand the utilization of Bitcoin as payment method, you don't need to do anything else, just have your Bitcoin wallet ready and know how to safely use it. Treat all of your Bitcoin holdings as high risk investment (as in, do not spend your food and housing money on it). You can buy more (regardless of your contractor payments), you can sell some as needed in your life and you can **allocate a portion** of your contractor bitcoin payments (if you keep getting them) for "savings", in the same way you would normally do for cash payments.

Total coins currently mined is known and this is a precise number. If you are trying to estimate the fraction of "lost forever" coins, then I think one can look at the very early blocks and see how many coins are still "sitting" at those addresses. If those did not move by now, their private keys are more than likely lost.

Ok thanks. How about this question: "Is difficulty adjustment a step-wise process, or it will just "jump" to whatever the current hash rate is, be it high or low?" For example, if 99% of miners just go "on strike" and turn their equipment off. Hash rate will be 100 fold less, will difficulty then drop accordingly, right after initial 2000+ blocks, or will it go there somehow more gradually?

I appreciate this. So, difficulty would indeed drop to where it needs to be, but not more than 1/4 of previous value and stay there for another 2016 blocks, even if the drop was not enough to "fit" lower hash rate. Right? Is there any meaning to a number of blocks being 2016? It is current year :o)
@_date: 2016-05-23 05:18:37
Well, this perspective makes some sense, but you are probably not saying that the Bitcoin market value is revolving exclusively around the mining, right? Or does it eventually?
For example, let's say Bitcoin technology's market cap is currently $ 10 billion. One organization comes in and states, "we are spending $ 30 billion doing this and that, but we will now start using this technology, and we will spend only $20 B instead". This action directly translates into technology's value increase by $10B to a total of $20 B (doubled). Are you saying that this action also suppose to lead to doubling of mining costs?

@_date: 2016-05-23 21:48:24
Am I getting this right? If this new (by far the highest ever) hash rate will stay for a while, then difficulty level will accordingly increase before halving. It means that when after halving some miners will be turning off their equipment, the remaining miners will face far greater difficulty level than otherwise was expected. Then, it may take a lot longer until difficulty decreases again. All of this  is not good, right?
P.S. Is it halveing, halvening or halving?

If I may, I think this may be misinterpreted. NO decision pressure exists at all! This is not a "pick one or another" type of a situation, this is two independent, lives for your coins and you can have them both. You can do absolutely everything you wanted to do on the main chain, the forked out chain should not have any effect on your plans and activity in this respect. Feel free to just ignore the forked out chain, or perhaps pull up the popcorn and see what happens over there and just know that all of your current coins are on that chain too, the exact same amount of them, simply mirrored. Even if you spend all of your main chain coins, you will still have the forked/mirrored ones.

In this particular "demonstration" I don't understand why Hydrick wouldn't just do his trick and blow on the page and see what happens. It may be possible to send a blow just above the styrofoam particles and onto the page. Besides, there were no particles behind the book.
After that, even if particles moved, he could say they moved because of the same "force" he applied to move the page. Why would anybody expect him to be able to apply his "moving objects ability" **selectively** to one object and not to the other, laying right next to it. In the other setting, if they for instance would put two pencils right next to one another, would they expect him to move one pencil and not both?
P.S. about directional, precise blowing, this is really doable. I for instance can blow off candles from a good distance with just one short blow.

Yes, if fiat was requested as a method of payment, anyone in the "minimum know" can do it 100% anonomously. Let me explain if I may. 
First of all I want to say this, if Ulbricht (particularly, the person in custody) somehow indeed made this (particular) transfer directly traceable to him, he is an idiot and there is no way such person could have pulled out an enterprise like SilkRoad. The fact is, what is known to feds is that a person who identified himself as DPR on SR and who did run SR, had $80K wire arranged. 
The actual bank transfer in reality was most likely made from the account of one of the digital currency exchangers, which in turn was probably a result of Bitcoins to wire exchange order. For as long as the sending Bitcoin address is spoofed somehow (this is what SR was good at), such transaction is totally anonymous, because exchangers send wires out to any third party without any verification or asking any questions questions, for as long as they are certain of funds to be exchanged are received and secured (this is what Bitcoin transfers are guaranteeing).
The reason feds are saying that Ulbricht sent this wire, is NOT because he was sloppy about it and/or not have taken care of making it anonymously, but because they connected Ulbricht to being DPR via other means. Therefore, whatever DPR did and say, is (at least at this point) considered to be all done by a person in custody named Ulbricht.

I think this is just their business decision and I'd even say it should be respected. Compare this "decent exit" to bank sharks, silently closing exchanger accounts (and some even freezing funds) and refusing to talk about it whatsoever.
To be honest, I don't get dwolla's business and it looks like they are operating significantly below their ernings potential. Their fee is only 25 cents on any transfer. I guess they are getting something from the Credit Union they keep user funds with, but still, it cannot be a lot.

I guess one way to deal with it would be to argue, but can Bitcoin Foundation actually get that license? ... and then, start doing money transmitting services, such as directly "sponsoring" new exchangers for instance?
From another hand, what is probably happening is the "probing" by the government of the "legal standing" of everything related to Bitcoin and such "probing" is obviously done with the great deal of exaggerations on the part of Government. To this end, if everything the government structures put forward against the Bitcoin innovation is accepted and complied with, the technology may be simply destroyed.

Not necessarily, if not the opposite. Websites like this have their own, rather big user base and they can see new articles before the Bitcoin crowd comes in, per reddit post (I am not sure if even a thousand people saw this link).
This website has enormous amount of visitors, its Google PR is 8, Alexa 1.4K (meaning, only 1.4K websites on the whole Internet have more visitors than them).

This same question was valid half the current price back. Hard to say what is happening right now, but if you go by a common wisdom related to "too good to be true", investing right now seems way too risky (we are looking at some 400% price growth within just a month). From another hand and like I said, the same warning could have been reasonably given when bitcoin was at $200 levels, yet one would have doubled the investment since.

You actually did not lose (as you put it), you missed on the opportunity of PROFIT of that magnitude. There are however a lot of people who are at a big loss factually. One could actually calculate how much exactly people **are CURRENTLY** at a loss **on average** based on trading data from exchanger charts. There is price difference and there is volume.

In today's digital world and in US in particular, the businesses which are by law required to verify the identities of their customers, are given limited electronic access to the official government databases. The questions you see, are not created by Bitinstant, but by such databases and if you answer them correctly, Bitinstant simply gets the "verified" message as a result.
Once again, this is NOT a credit check (where did you get that idea from?), this is your ID check ONLY. By the way, if you are having troubles remembering some of the questions, you can restart the thing and questions will be different.
@_date: 2013-05-20 23:48:26
In my opinion, you are NOT transparent at all and your fees are ENORMOUS!
Here is a real life model and an example of the bitcoins purchase order:
I am sending you $1,000 via Cash deposit at CVS for instance and requesting Bitcoins sent to bitcoin address.
Step one: You charge a whooping 4% to start with (BTW, putting in a 3.99% is cheesy) . This is more than a wire fee, a lot more than any payment processor would charge and this would make my $1K becoming a $960 Bitinstantly.
I guess, you can claim this fee to be a "reasonable" convenience fee, because people could supposedly use retailers to deposit cash. However, such deposit still requires a physical "walk in" into the store, while the same "walk in" could be done into the bank branch by the customer, to make the wire transfer to exchangers directly, thus saving on this fee. Besides, as most people do not carry too much cash, they'd have to stop by the bank anyway.
Step two (the exchange rates "trap"): 
As of the time of this writing, the rates are:
$123.5 - MtGox, 
$117.5 - Bitstamp
$114 - BTC-e
I bet you are NOT going to give your customers BTC-e rate, but the one of MtGox and more likely exceeding even that.
So, the difference in these rates is another 8+%, making my original $1K becoming only about $880 worth of coins once converted using your "service" .
The other feature you are advertising your service as, is supposedly an arbitrage. This is simply NOT true! NEVER did I see you to have two codes/vouchers for different exchangers at the same time, for any extended period of time. Only ONCE did I see the MtGox to BTC-e exchange option, but YOUR exchange fee was completely nullifying any possible arbitrage gains.
Overall, in my opinion, your service seems to be targeted nearly exclusively at people, who are very new to the market and therefore are not aware that there are a lot more decent alternatives to your "service" out there. Everybody else would use your service, ONLY as some sort of emergency.

Tell them to look at BitPay. They do not have to actually hold bitcoins, if they don't want to.

I have a feeling there is a lack of understanding here on how merchants are using Bitcoins (suppose to) to accept payments and what are the advantages of it. Those accepting BTC as a method of payment for their goods and services, are still dealing with their fiat currencies at the end of the day. All their accounting books for taxing purposes are the same, whether or not they accept Bitcoins. Some businesses accept credit cards (CC) only, some CC + PayPal for instance, some CC + PayPal + Dwolla + Google Checkout + Bitcoins, but the end result is the same. These are all just different methods of payments, which merchants are trying to offer customers to gain their business and their overall business profit/loss/taxing is still counted in fiat.
In other words, whenever you see that this and that business started to accept Bitcoins, do NOT think that these business decided to actually hold any Bitcoins.
Any business not converting Bitcoin payments (at least greatest share of them) into fiat money instantly, is a totally irresponsible idiot, putting at enormously huge risk on business and everyone involved. Not taking huge volatility seriously is a BIG mistake. 
About conversion costs: The rest of good businesses are paying ONLY some 1%+ to BitPay for BTC to fiat conversion and (to the opposite of what you are saying) this is a lot LESS than what credit card companies charge merchants in per transaction fees. Merchants' other HUGE advantage is that with Bitcoin payments, businesses are 100% free of charge back fraud, from which a lot of businesses, especially those with marginal profits are seriously suffering.

What I noticed in their estimates regarding bitcoin mining, is the fact of huge negative difference between the energy cost and mined bitcoins worth:


They used Bitcoin/USD rate: 131, which is about current, so the expense/profit ratio is a horrible **259 fold** ($259 loss in energy cost for every $1 (one dollar) earned) . Is this what it really is? Are the currently sold miners really beating the "home computer" by THAT much to get into profit?

I politely disagree. The total market volume is still low, with China included.
Here is the total volume distribution chart as of right now:
We can make fair estimate of the market volume by looking at MtGox for instance, which is right now takes about 25%.
If you then look at 2 years MtGox data, you will see that the sum volume for the last 3 weeks (one bar is one week, see the last tree little bars, adjust the volume by 75% to account for MtGox being a quarter of total) is in fact **at all times low**, in comparison to prior months, especially to the times when BTC price last peaked into $200+ range:

The effect is first of all that you are getting big time advertisement to the Bitcoin community for free (i guess this is actually the main reason businesses announcing the Bitcoin addition). In case you really will happen to get paid in Bitcoins for your services, you will need to be prepared converting them to fiat immediately. Due to huge volatility of Bitcoin prices, you cannot afford to be holding any Bitcoins, as it may/will have big impact on your financial books.

There are no major bad news, so this must be just an emotional dump. I would agree with "much needed correction" statement. There was way too much stress built with the latest run up in price (we almost doubled in about a week). Apparently, the pressure was so great that even the minor trigger, like a single sizable sell, caused what we see.
I do think we should get back to the uptrend shortly, although I for once am not going to try and "catch" the bottom. Will get back in only after the positive trend is established.

I wanted to post similar argument against the very need for Money Transmitting Business license, but I argued with myself and didn't. 
Here is why:
Even on the first glance and as stated by this post author, it must be obvious to anyone, that trading Bitcoins via MtGox involves depositing funds to one's MtGox account and withdrawing back to the same one's bank account (via Dwolla or what have you). All of this does NOT indeed involves person to person transfer, but only self to self. 
HOWEVER, one of the features that MtGox has made available to the public, is to create MtGox voucher (redeemable code) and THIS is what makes transfers to other users using MtGox possible. THIS is money transmitting function and THIS is what makes MtGox a money transmitting business. 
One can also simply create a Payment button to make transactions from any user to any other user possible. This is also money transmission.
If it was not for these user to user transfer functions (which every exchanger has), than the original argument would stand.
If MtGox would remove these functions, then they would be right to argue that they do NOT allow for user to user transactions.

Not at all, but the exact opposite (if you mean spending more on merchandise and services).
As more Bitcoins are spent on actual purchases (not trading them for fiat), the demand for Bitcoins will grow and in turn its value.
The way I see it in the "perfect" future, where Bitcoin mediated transactions are more or less widely adopted (restaurants, grocery stores, bus/train/plane tickets, gas/car charger stations, et.c.) people will just have some $0.5K-$2K worth of Bitcoins in their wallet to spend for everyday needs and will be replenishing their stash once in a while (like actual "pocket cash" or like gas for the car).
By the way, assuming such future will come, one could probably estimate the value at which Bitcoin price should plateau. Take the average amount of USD one needs to carry in his/her wallet in Bitcoins, multiply that by the total number of people (:o)), then divide that by the total number of Bitcoins in existence. If everyone was like me (a person living in US) with their daily/monthly spending, the Bitcoin price would be at around $70,000/BTC (seventy thousand).

So true and this is what will probably eventually kill Apple. Steve Jobs knew perfectly well what he was doing and most importantly HOW to do it. The rest of the team only thinks they know, but as time goes by, they will be lost. I am not saying that exec team is bad, but the fact is, they are only as good as the rest of execs in all of their competitor camps. I AM however saying that Steve Jobs was by far exceptional in his thinking and ideas implementation to life. So, if Aple's execs team don't start "opening up" (so to speak) about NOW, they will die slow death as a company and a FORMER innovator.

1. Your transactions will first of all not even initiate from an empty wallet. 
Interestingly and what I also personally tried to do with my MultiBit client in respect to checking for fake transactions, was the following: 
I reset all of my transactions (there is such function in MultiBit), which is when you basically erase them all, then have the client fetching them from the network. In the process, as my transactions were populating the client records, I could actually see the already spent funds showing up as "available" for short periods of time (this is when "funds received" records are JUST added). So, I tried to send bitcoins at such moments and while I did get a record of such fake transaction in my wallet, it did not went through, with the "double spend" error.
To sum it up - you cannot fake the Bitcoin transaction and that's one of the beauties of it.

Look, if banks are not to deal with anything involving Bitcoins in China, HOW would merchants get received Bitcoins converted to fiat legally? If they can't, what is the point accepting BTC for products and services?
Overall, as much as I hate it myself, the recent China Central Banks' statement is a big blow to Bitcoin community, especially to those who bought in recently. I think it is so because it is China, nearly exclusively, who drove the price up from around $100 - $200 to $1200 and right now, as we speak, it is taking the price **all the way back down, with not even a HINT on the price uptrend**.

People's reaction is of course understandable, but all I am saying is that this reaction is now converting to a massive panic and this should NOT be happening! Panic is no one's "friend", ever!
The issues at hand are obviously purely technical (compare that to legal ones...) and knowing what this business is, the solutions have to be only a matter of time AND of the capacity of staff resources.
I do not have any funds in Bitinstant at the moment, but I did have $9,000+ very recently "sitting in limbo" for 10+ days, while withdrawing from MtGox. I did NOT "feel differently" then, I did NOT panic, I did not started the "scam" threads on Reddit...
I am pretty sure that current Bitinstant issues are more than likely to be a matter of the past, in just a few days.

The comparison period is too short to be statistically significant. Let's see if the trend stands even a couple of months down the road.
On a side note, current (past couple of months) BTC trading patterns **are NOT natural at all** in my opinion. Not to say that it is a bad thing, but I think early adapters, who hold "too much, to dump" bitcoins, are now holding the volatility "in place".

I think you are exaggerating the issue WAY too much. You cannot possibly get in trouble even if you were knowingly to take these bills to Walmart. You did confused the bills in reality and if it was not for bartender's water, you could have passed those bills to others unknowingly and no one can prove if you did otherwise.
Now for me, as I never in my life seen a well done fake bills, I would consider it a collection item and if I'd have one, I'd never let it go. I would probably be proudly showing it to everybody around me for a long, long time...

So, if your business makes under $10K per time period and you deposit earnings to the bank, you are being "flagged" as "structuring"?
What I also noticed in this particular case, is that prosecutors took "action" against this couple RIGHT BEFORE the tax filing time. Thus, the other article on the same topic, published in April of 2012 said:


It looks like if feds just waited for a couple more weeks for this couple to file the tax return, where they would most likely report all of the income in question, they would not have the "case", or would they?

Well, I did generalized the statement you quoted, but you are placing some way too extreme examples into it. By the way, yes, US CAN dictate some of the foreign policies for as long as there is a leverage to threaten them with. 
In fact, the subject here, Switzerland, is a perfect example of such "dictation": 
1. Give us what we are asking for and make a law in your country out of it. 
2. You should have known who you are dealing with and to begin with, you should have known that US citizens are not a subject of banking privacy anywhere in the world. You did not volunteer to report to us, therefore you owe us a penalty of $10Bn, so you know better next time we approach you.
3. If you do not comply right now, forget about using US dollars altogether, we will cut you off..."

The indictment looks strange actually in a sense that its main point is that LR must now pay United States a lot of money. There is nothing in this indictment about regular system users, about what will happen to their funds and/or if there will be any action taken for funds recovery.

I wonder what is US Government up to, by (sort of) not minding Bitcoins for now? What if the plan is to wait until everything crashes to ashes (and they are somehow sure of it to happen), then when ripped off people come to complain to their Government for letting this to happen, the almighty would simply "slap them in the face" having a good case supporting central regulation and with major problems associated with something that is not regulated...

Any type of digital currency exchange service is sooner or later seen by the US Government as "Money Transmitting Business", for which they want such service to obtain corresponding license. If exchangers do not obtain such license (regardless of where they are domiciled) and they become "popular" (including among US users), US Authorities will cut such exchangers by any means available. 
If such exchangers are not US based, US authorities will "cut" everything related to transactions with US residents. In this example Dwolla is within their easy reach, so they have now done it. 
By the way, it is quite possible that IF MtGox was to follow up on their agreement with CoinLab, this sanction against MtGox would not have taken place. To remind you, CoinLab wanted to take over of US based MtGox accounts and take care about all of the compliance legalities for such accounts.
It is also possible that it was pis*ed off CoinLab, who tipped off the authorities to act against MtGox.

I am personally not actually a big fan of Bitinstant service, but common, let's be fair.
Bitinstant is a compliant, legal business by all means, with reputable financial backing, with real people and even known faces behind it! Calling it a scam and proposing to call the DA and even FBI, because of the temporary tech glitches, is insane and plain stupid. Those doing it, have no place in this and (for that matter) in ANY of the new, developing industries and technologies. Anything new is NEVER a smooth path!

Well, this is how trading works, right? This market is overly sensitive to just about everything. If there is no significant reason for a major price drop, like some "bad news" (I believe there is no), market will recover shortly.
However, such extreme "sensitivity" we see right now in front of us, is probably related to the enormous amount of stress, due to SO VERY SIGNIFICANT price advance during the last FEW days (we almost doubled in a matter of one week). We actually need a bit of a pull back, to be sure that the uptrend we see is a real deal.
All IHMO of course.

Updating and it **DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AT ALL**:
It has been now two weeks since I requested bank wire withdrawal, yet **funds are NOT received**. (The two-weeks time frame figure comes from MtGox support themselves, who, per my inquiry, said that "...there is approximately a two-week back-log we need to overcome").
The answers I got from support today, comes to: 1. Truly insulting excuse about "processing wires manually" (with no estimates) and 2. about the option I supposedly have to cancel the withdrawal request, to get the funds back on the account.
If I am suggested to cancel the requested at this point of waiting, it must mean they have no plans to process the withdrawal any time soon (otherwise,they would not have mention this option).
The two-weeks estimate that MtGox is giving to system users (it is also stated so on their website) is **plain LIE**
They simply MUST know current processing times, because if they do indeed send "loads of wires" daily, there are very specific request dates for such wires from customers. To this end, I now also asked a very direct question: what are the dates of withdrawal requests from users, which they processed TODAY (one would think it has to be an easy answer).
What really bugs me is, I do not understand how can it be possible that with all the attention to Bitcoins in the main stream media **ACROSS THE GLOBE**, MtGox is still having by far the highest share of exchange market, it also in fact DRIVES the prices, **YET, at the same time MtGox seems to be completely insolvent (at least at the moment)** ???

LR was never a "competition" to Bitcoins, it "lived" totally on its own, therefore in my opinion, its closure has no effect on Bitcoins whatsoever. I used LR for many years, alone with other payment processors and its demise is simply a logical outcome for any and all payment systems out there, which are "short" of getting money transmitting licenses all over the world and in US in particular. I've seen many of them "come and go" (e-gold, e-bullion, INTGold, StormPay, altergold, ePassporte... ) and for LR  it was only a matter of time.
The most important conclusion one should make from all these closures of the past, is to NEVER keep excessive amounts of funds in any of such payment processor systems.

Welcome to the digital world!
This is NOT a credit check, this is part of the process of your personal verification, based on the SS number you provided (Dwolla and many other financial institutions in US do that too BTW). 
Verification by submitting the scans of personal documents, is something from the last century (can be easily forged). 
In today's digital world and in US in particular, the businesses which are by law required to verify the identities of their customers, are given limited electronic access to the official government databases. The questions you see, are not created by Bitinstant, but by such databases and if you answer them correctly, Bitinstant simply gets the "verified" message as a result.

They are probably sending out only whatever comes in and they do not dare to create problems for Japanese customer base, because they are registered in Japan. 
There is simply no other reasonable explanation. I guess, they **MAY ** catch up over time, once they earn enough in fees to cover for their shortage.
I hope their BTC withdrawals will not "suffer" in any way, but I would not be surprised if this in fact will happen, considering the (bad) way they do business.

Actually, there must be some progress at MtGox. The fact that they gave you the time for which they are processing requests (6 weeks old) is something positively NEW.
Yes, it is slow of course, but in comparison to the total halt in USD wire processing, that they were having just a couple of weeks back, this is a progress.

Locksley, How do you handle bets right at the "cut off" time? You know, with the number of confirmations et.c....

I am also not quite getting the fees structure, it seems way too much. Any thoughts about capping them perhaps?. Let's say the game gets popular and you will have 1K BTC in total bets per round. Are you saying you will be insisting on getting paid with **up to** 200 BTC per round at that time?

Other merchants will probably take a note about the "spike" in new customers for their business. This becomes typical for every business that adds Bitcoin payment options and such "spiking" trend, seems to be growing and beneficial for both, new merchants and bitcoin community.

I don't see how the "room for misinterpretation" concerns are any worse than the fact that actual system users, almost in concord, publicly concluding that MtGox is a non less but a SCAM (after not being able to get their money out of the system). If MtGox by itself creates the situation when people a left to guess about what is going on, then be it. 
Should we just sit and wait until some authorities would simply close the "shop" down and seize the domain? 
Or, should the public know as much as they can about the issues (even if there is some "room for misinterpretation" on information) and make their (better) informed decision about staying with/away from MtGox?
I do really think that one or another way of a shut down, is where MtGox is heading. It WILL, and when it happens, the effect on the whole Bitcoin movement may be huge in a negative way (starting from massive sell off). If more people move away before this "issue" hits the fan, consequences should then be less devastating.

I will confirm once and when my request gets processed. In my humble opinion, the spread's nature is in the fact that withdrawals are indeed delayed and the "market" simply determined how much such delays are "worth" (so to speak). That "value" compensating for delays, is currently stands at about some 17%, when compared to BTC prices at exchangers, which are processing withdrawals relatively fast.
Now, that withdrawals are shut down completely is not likely. Therefore spread will likely decrease once people realize that there is almost guaranteed option to make some 15% - 20% per two (or three, or even four) weeks period (per whatever the current wait time).

There is nothing wrong with speculation, which is simply due to the ever increasing exposure of this technology to people in the main stream media (Silk Road related news blast in particular). The very first thing new to bitcoin people are noticing is the price growth, which is why they are thinking of an **investment instrument**, before anything else.
If Bitcoin gets adopted in the way and the scale we want it to, we have to realize that the worth of Bitcoin, as easy and secure **payment instrument**, is magnitudes higher than current prices.
In other words, **there cannot be increase in transactions if more new to technology people do not have bitcoins** and ready to spend them. So, what you see, is new people are getting bitcoins and I am pretty sure we are in fact NOT done with further rapid price increase.

Merchants do NOT price their products in Bitcoins, there is just no way to do so.  They have fixed dollar prices and the Bitcoin equivalent is floating (on a minute by minute basis). Bitcoins for them is just a transaction media and I do not think any serious business should be taking a risk of holding ALL of the paid in Bitcoins. Some of such business owners probably keep a small fraction of payments in Bitcoins as their personal "investment".

To tell you the truth, I am a lot more surprised not by the questions, but by the very fact that PayPal even has this kind of survey. I previously thought that if anything, PayPal sees only the competition in Bitcoins.
I think this is a very big deal in a very positive way for Bitcoin community. 
This survey means that PayPal is serious about and is officially checking out the Bitcoin system.
Can you imagine the scale of Bitcoin usage expansion if PayPal, in addition to Credit Cards and ACH transfers, would add Bitcoins? This will be then the only option that would guarantee payments to merchants (no charge back concerns).
For PayPal, incorporating Bitcoins into system will require only minimal efforts as they already have all of the legal formalities taken care of and obviously huge users base.
They must be seeing the advantages of BitPay and this is why they are exploring... From another hand, I personally do NOT think they will do it, because at this point, they are too "corporate", therefore slow and reluctant with acting on innovations.
...Time to load up with Bitcoins?

Pending withdrawal request here as well, but the 5% is NOT something they are offering to everyone. 
It DOES for sure looks like MtGox is NOT processing bank wire transfers right now at all 
What they are doing, is they are simply experimenting on system users with different types of replies on support request and then looking at reaction.

While certainly unpleasant (it sucks...), it is probably legal enough to justify their actions.  They are business, financial business, it is their choice who to do business with and who deny/cancel the service . They did not "steal" funds and they would have simply release them before account closure, but knowing about the possibility of charge backs, they put a hold on some of the funds.

Here is the "conspiracy theory" :o) :
MtGox must be owning a lot of Bitcoins since early days (I'd say about 20 % of total Bitcoins in circulation), which are pretty much worthless to them. They cannot just dump them all, but they can use them to manipulate the market. 
We know that Bitcoin began to massively attract attention of the public since some time in March 2013 and this is when traded volume started to significantly decrease (see volume bars on the chart)
Real people started to buy and drive the price up. In reality, real people where pretty much buying Bitcoins not from each other, but mostly from MtGox owners...
Anyway, those 0.1 to 2 BTC trades on MtGox, going out about every second, are NOT likely the trades made by real people.

Why on earth would you even take this IDIOTIC initiative and go look for unnecessary troubles for the entire bitcoin community? 
Isn't there enough issues with exchangers?
Are gold mining companies money transmitters? 
I might be wrong, but I don't think so. 
Gold is the commodity, which upon mining can be sold to those interested to buy. If I find a golden nugget, I will just go ahead and sell it. Are you saying that I need to ask for "ruling" from FinCEN before I do so?
Bitcoins is a DIGITAL commodity, which one "digs" using the computing power. When you sell "digital nuggets", you are NOT transmitting money, you are selling digital commodity. What happens with sold bitcoins next, is a different story and is NOT a miner's concern (same as for physical gold!). 
Are you planning to "request a ruling" on the legality of even installing the mining software too? 
... seems like a logical next step, after the feds will "digests" the thoughts YOU are putting into their heads.

We will probably pull back a bit (some 10% - 15% or so) right now (relative to Gox's $184 and Bitstamp of $166). There was REALLY too much of the price advance happening within just a few days, pretty much without any resistance tests. 
However, I don't think one needs to worry about mild corrections, they are healthy and overall it does looks like we are heading to new all time highs.

I am not sure how the Bitcoins got involved here at all. If your primary goal was to bail the friend out, why would you be bringing up the Bitcoins matter at all.
You get cash, you bring it to bail taking place and you are done. If they for some reason concerned about where the money are coming from (they normally DO NOT), they would initiate independent investigation of YOU, not your friend.
I think you are faking the whole story here (I don't understand the purpose though).

He most likely made an exchange bitcoins to bank wire and that can be done anonymously. In case you did not know, there is a whole bunch of exchangers out there who can easily send bank wires to third parties, without questions asked.
Bitcoin is not the only digital currency out there, but all exchangers do take Bitcoins, because this is a guaranteed payment.

Actually, reading more on this thread and looking over the transactions of the address to where the 05. BTC from your chap's wallet went, I am no longer 100 % sure he is innocent.  You for a fact have a direct proof that you did sent bitcoins, however, it is a lot more difficult for him to prove that a final destination address is not his. Perhaps, it is actually you, who may consider going to the police :o)
P.S. If you have some time at hands, see if there is an IP overlap with other transactions on that "final destination" address, with that of your "chap". If (as feds say) DPR was sloppy enough to get busted, chances are, your "chap" may have been sloppy as well.

Well, I guess the publicity (it is in the major news chanels) they gave to the shutdown of SilkRoad will be backfiring big time.
Millions of people found out yesterday **for the very first time**, about very existence of things like Tor, underground Internet and about illegal market places there.
For some it will be just a matter of satisfying their curiousity to go and look what is it all about. And to others, this will be like a revaluation in finding technologically modern place and venue to do their illegal deeds.
This was practically a direct sponsorship and a big scale promotion by the US Government of the super modern and technologically advanced underground economy.

Well, I know, but people also have to be consistent in what they are saying. Right **before the high speed "runup"** started (but, in fact, AFTER already big gains on that particular day), I even started a thread ( asking "who is buying". The most reasonable (and upvoted the most) answer was "China is buying", which as we know now was the truth AND the reason. So, now China is selling and not having any incentives to hold on to Bitcoins, it is only logical to assume that they will "put" the price at least back to where they "started". At that point or around, the rest of the world shall "take care" of (at least) stabilizing the price.

In most cases they ARE bad, very bad and this is the reason they are not doing private practice as attorneys for hire. Of course, the few EXCEPTIONS from this, are new in the field, young talented individuals, who are just starting their carrier. However, as they get successful on their job as public defendants (2, 3,4 good cases), they will be quickly moving up into private practice.
Becoming a for hire defense attorney, is on the mind of MOST people with JD degree working in the justice system. Even the DAs once become successful are often "switching sides" and become attorneys for hire.

I watch charts VERY closely and I don't really see the price to be any stable right now. 
BTCChina (which is currently driving the price) is still, at this moment, on a solid downtrend since its all time highs. It is a straight line down, with not even a HINT for the uptrend to be developing (see BTCChina 4h chart at bitcoinwisdom.com).
The USD based exchangers do however try to "show" some resistance (I discount MtGox completely, it just follows and its trades are mostly done by their bots...), but I guess not for long IF, China keeps selling. 
P.S. All are just own opinions.

In BTC.
When you send BTC to another BTC address (that is without converting it to any other currency), your transaction fee is obviously in BTC.
However, if you are paying in dollars and such payment involves Bitcoins (Like payment using BidPay for instance) and the receiving party also receives dollars, then from your perspective, your fees will be in dollars.

Good question. There was another thread (or two) here, where a person voluntarily "forced" the fact of using bitcoins onto some unaware about it officials, which caused troubles. Why push the luck? How about "Not asked, don't tell" approach?
