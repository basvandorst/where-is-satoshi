I signed up in December and was approved a week ago. Once you get in Gemini is mostly pretty great. I don't like that you can't easily see profits or loses individually for btc and eth without calculating it.

I didn't miss the rules, I defied them.

I can't imagine why the mods would want to remove your post. Hm... Perhaps it's the 1 or 2 slight typos you made?

This is so fucking stupid.

If you are HODLing you aren't dumg

I am happy. Just because some numbers are moving around doesn't mean a thing.
Just relax. Don't check things for a few weeks. It'll take some time for things to move in the right direction again.

I am too scared to buy right now. I suspect it may get down in the 5k range, so I will wait for that.

I just don't get it. What is the business that you want to do, Theo? Do you want to be a bank? Because that is what you said in the video. 
You are pushing so hard to get your name out there I am just curious what you are selling?
Is there a Theo Coin ICO we should all know about?
Seriously. What is your goal with all this? Do you just want Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency to be unregulated forever? Why do I only hear about how bad NY state is and nothing about what your product is? Why can't you make billions of dollars off of the strength of your ideas in the current market like others have done instead of claiming that the "Bitlicense" is the obstacle preventing you from radical success?
Can you please explain what you want @_date: 2018-04-17 20:43:36
New York and California are the ultimate nanny states, so of course they would be first to attempt full regulation. You didn't predict anything, it's just obvious this was coming.
So, as much as I want to commend you for your psychic powers, my 3 year old nephew could have predicted the same thing.
Also, if a mother fucker is going to be running an exchange I think they should have to prove that they are competent and have the necessary capital to keep such a business afloat. This is common sense. A Bitlicense would instantly eliminate most of the bad actors from the scene.

Your title says it costs 0.001 but the page says 0.01. This is actually a big difference.

This makes me happy. I didn't even realize I was also a Bitcoin Millionaire. Damn. Thanks for the optimism OP.

Small businesses should be allowed to get in on Bitcoin software development and a whole slew of other types of businesses, but my issue comes when a company holds large amounts of user currency.
There is a difference between Coinbase, which has massive responsibility to care for people's money, and CryptoKitties, a stupid joke startup that doesn't need regulation.

Yesterday was one the most exciting day I've had in months.

You may be disappointed to learn that you only make about 10 cents per day with 2 PCs. It really depends on the type of processor inside.
Until you understand what setup you need I would not bother.

You have an incredible ego. I guarantee you are not as important as you think you are.

He certainly has more patience than the Fed. The guy has $7 billion dollars but will likely never touch it, meanwhile the Fed blows through more than that every day.

Yes. Most ICOs are scams to get the founders of that coin rich. After receiving their windfall most of these companies dissolve or cease working on their product because it is easier to make 20 ICOs and profit from them individually than to dedicate your time to 1 coin and work for years to make it better and raise the value of each individual coin. 
That is why I advise people to not invest in any coin until it has been around for 3 years. Meaning it may be safe to start investing in Ethereum now that the 3 years test period has passed and it seems to have some staying power.

While it is great that the company suddenly takes security seriously, I would pull out everything and never use their service again. It's too late.

There are a few obstacles I see preventing wide-spread adoption right now.
- Converting USD to Bitcoin is annoying. Many people get denied for exchanges or lose interest. Fees keep getting higher. 
- Asset class. There is a percentage of bitcoin users that have never mined bitcoin or purchased anything with it. They simply view it as an investment and will sell it all once the price gets high enough for them. Are these people even considered users? 
- Volatility. Because the price is constantly going crazy it scares off anyone who might consider making a major purchase with it. As far as I know the only huge purchase to ever be made with bitcoin was some gold thing associated with Nelson Mandela. At least when you buy things with USD you don't have the value obsession because no one really cares about the purchasing power of the dollar considering it is relatively stable. Can you imagine right now only having bitcoin as an option to buy things with?! That would be fucking horrible. Until things get better bitcoin is not a realistic way to actually pay for anything over $1000. 
- Technobabble bullshit. Honestly, if you saw Ready Player One and the Halliday character - that is exactly what Satoshi is to some people; a big airheaded socially awkward guy who made this computer stuff for his computer dork friends to watch porn with or something. All this stuff appears fake and complicated and weird to someone that invests in bonds. Crypto needs to stop feeling like a garage in Cupertino and more like a bank where you can talk to a human and get protection if something goes wrong.
- Winter is coming. Regulation. Will. Happen. It will happen hard and it will happen fast. 
I'm just parroting though.

In a way I do see your point. I think Craig Wright needs to explain why he lied before doing more speaking engagements, because he is essentially capitalizing on a lie right now. 
I also see a lot of people getting excited about Joseph Poon's remark and Vitalik's anger, so maybe this will be a good thing for the market by getting people excited again. I do think this Satoshi scandal has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way and caused them to lose interest. Maybe some scandals will get people excited again. And that's always a good thing.
I guess I take back what I said before.

I wish you luck even though I think you are wrong.

Your ideology is leading you to ruin.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:45:35
Baseless accusation.
When a telemarketer calls you OF COURSE they are going to lie to you about how they got your number. Coinbase is the most popular exchange, so it makes sense that this would be the first name to come to this person's mind when asked where they got your phone number.
They could have got it from Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, etc. 
There is no proof Coinbase sold your information.

Bitfinex has a minimum USD deposit amount of $10,000, so in general rich people are on that platform. There are also a ton of investor/mining "groups" that pool their resources on that site. I have a friend who does that actually. And yes, a lot of groups on Bitfinex are trying to do high cost trades every day to try to make profits every day instead of HODLing like the rest of us.
Another huge problem is bots. People pay money to buy algorithms that purchase coins for them while they sleep or work or whatever. I believe a lot of this movement is being caused by bots trying to day trade for people with lots of money.
The price changes are just a consequence of the way they are programming their bots to behave. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:30:18
At first I was like, hey let's give Bitfinex a chance here before we all go crazy. Then I saw this, 
My word. The 5th largest crypto exchange in the world is probably associated with cartels.

Do you mean what would the reaction have been if the entire world's markets had grown 2000% in one year, and then collapsed 70%?
I think most people would realize that the world's markets had actually grown 700%, even after the collapse, and luckily some people profited from that bubble. Bumps were had, but overall we are in a better place than we were a year ago.
