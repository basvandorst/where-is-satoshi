No, it's a project of the freemasons. We're the puppets as usual  Cheesy. I think all this conspiracy stuff is bullshit. It's in the people's nature to think there's more..

There is no word of bitcoin, as i've understood the main idea is to provide small tips for good posts! You can do it with any currency, but if people will see bitcoin currency in acceptable ones it will be kind of advertisement.

In some kind they are right, as bitcoin rate goes down some people forget of this currency :(

It certainly has the potential to be huge, if it doesn't rush it and can offer a true multicurrency wallet, wow, great stuff, send X currency, receive and convert to X currency and so on. 
It certainly has the major backers in the field.
