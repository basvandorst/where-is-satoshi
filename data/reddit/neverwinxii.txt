For "the next few months". You pay taxes an entire year.

Ya but any coin can be used as a store of value, plus being usable as cash or any other benefit that chain provides. A store of value isn't any sort of advantage at all.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:27:48
Why would anyone use it just to store value? The only advantage bitcoin has is that it is the easiest to buy with fiat, but that is not going to be true for much longer.

Was the money just sitting in your account or were you trying to withdrawal?

This sub is as biased as r/btc or any other altcoin sub. At this point you just have to try to gather information from as many sources as you can and try to make a decision.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:17:51
might wanna keep 1/2 of that 500 for taxes lulz
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:21:09
Sold 25% at 19k
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:34
Transferred from ledger nano s to QuadrigaCX
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:21
Because I was having trouble sleeping / concentrating at that point since bitcoin became such a high percentage of my money. Wish I sold more now lmao
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:40:13
No, but he's a billionaire
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:47
Less miners = decreased difficulty
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:46:51
Nah, most people just want to make some quick cash on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:11:55
By this logic, bitcoin is a big comparative loss to litecoin, eth, and most major alts
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:09:17
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:31:16
Same here, although I don't have nearly as much crypto as you. Cashed out 25% yesterday hodling since 2014
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:16:52
But that's assuming the price will always go up
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:42
I think it is because you believe in crypto in general, but have fears that bitcoin can be overtaken. So you're fine as long as bitcoin remains high relative to alts. I've had similar thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:49:43
Bitcoin will be the top coin for the foreseeable future but no way it goes back to 90%. But then again this was a troll post
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:54
What, selling?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:52
Thanks for buying my bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:19:25
It absolutely is subject to capital gains. The link provided in the tax sections says


@_date: 2017-12-17 10:08:30
If you're scared then sell a %. I finally sold some today. Now I don't give a fuck if it goes to 100k or 3k. And I used to think I'd never even break even from bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:40:52
Lmao if bitcoin hits 100k he'll still have more btc than 99.9% of the sub. Don't think he'd care about cashing out 33%
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:53:16
Core's stubbornness to a 1MB really disillusioned me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:03:06
The only thing I'd be concerned about is that alts are holding their btc value much better. Back in the day a correction like this would have crushed altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:05:31
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:33:34
Cryptsy lulz. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:36:00
I really see no reason not to. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:21:41
I'd just wait for GBTC to pop then go all in
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:23:34
Every dollar you make more than holding, someone loses a dollar

Many people think wall street will massively short bitcoin when available
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:52
Uh, you can't come to the conclusion that the number of people would be less. It's possible that there are more people with combined addresses have over 100, than there are people with multiple addresses over 100
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:46:37
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:15:00
Lmao  is pretty damning. Pretty fishy
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:47:53
Any leveraged position in the stock market. Nvidia is up 100% in that time frame. If you had long term options you would be up way more than 200%
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:35:39
Kraken is pretty much the worst exchange in terms of uptime and site responsiveness
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:25:02
Not to say that the bots aren't manipulating the price, just that they have been there since day 1.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:39:24
Basically Android keeps a screenshot of each app you had open for the task manager. So if he hasn't opened coinbase in a while, the preview is showing an old price that is much lower than current.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:41:39
That's like 60% of the vocab of The other two are autistic and faggot
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:01:49
I mean, it is hindsight because everyone knows it's not easy to buy immediate bitcoin unless you have the money ready at an exchange or verified at coinbase, you will never be able to catch the bottom of those dips in time. 
If the price corrected 20% in the next 6 hours, would you be able to capitalize? Or would it again be a technical thing that prevented you from buying? 
Either just dollar cost average in or get your money on an exchange ASAP if you insist on catching dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:39:39
Limit order = You set the price you are willing to buy at. the order will not trigger unless someone sells at your target price or lower. I'm not familiar with GDAX but limit orders aren't related to fees in general.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:32:42
1M is enough that you should be conservative as you are already pretty much set. I'd put in 10%
If you had 10k I'd just yolo all in. 
Assuming you are young.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:20:21


@_date: 2017-11-13 08:18:15
That's normal.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:30:00
50%. If your life is shit, might as well go for it. 
Shit life + 10k in debt = still shit life
Shit life + 1 bitcoin when it hits 1M = not shit life

Lmao staying out of the market waiting to crash is literally the opposite of "I'm not smart enough to time the market"
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:22:47
Nope. If anything I regret dumping mine right after the fork believing everyone that said it would go to 0
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:36:30
Fine. It wasn't hindsight. It is a lack of foresight. Price movements are too fast for you to reliably catch dips while depending on someone else's schedule. Either dollar cost average or move your money to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:11:48
There may be a fixed supply of bitcoin, but there isn't a fixed supply of cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:20:23
Slow on Android too. Their servers can't keep up
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:11:44
TBH just because I'd be way more upset at not buying and btc going to 100k than buying and btc going to 0.
Basically FOMO
