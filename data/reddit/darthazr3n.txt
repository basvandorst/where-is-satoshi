That's exactly my point. I had no idea wtf he/she was talking about and pictured 3 guys in suits  typing at keyboards some how "backing" fait. Broken down, the entire statement is ludicrous to the point of nonconsideration.

Holy shit how true is this.!

Irrelevant. Not even what OP claimed and not what I was responding to. I never asserted money was or was not made out of nothing.

No, more so the over simplification of such. If FUD of BTC is bad so is FUD of fait. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:38:04
only... no... that's not how it works.

I know how silly, Everyone was supposed to understand from your incredibly accurate post that guys in suits = Central Bankers. I mean everyone knows only central bankers wear suits. Clearly from the positive attention this post is receiving we are all ignorant and you are very enlightened.

Which only speaks to the over simplification of the OP's post. The ignorant assertion that  ".. afew guys in suits.." is what I take issue with. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:56:26
Only that's not what you said so... changing your argument at your leisure does not make anything you said correct. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:01:58
First you posted few guys in suits, then you said central bankers and than you said central banks. Every post was different from the last both in scope and specificity. Nothing to discuss here...

Truth it is hyperbole. It is actually literally wrong however. OP was very  literal when referencing the "backing" (wtf that is) of BTC but hyperbole to the extreme with regard to the "backing" (again wtf that is) of Fait. So, no, he was wrong.

"...can be created from nothing" because Fait is so real ?! lol. This paper airplane is worth less than this printed money why ?
