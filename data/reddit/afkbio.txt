That's because the inflation measurement is absolutely flawed. There IS huge inflation, but it's not really obvious because the "basket of goods" is kept at low prices.

This impact is virtually non existent in a modern market. Arbitrage opportunities don't exist, thus the impact on price is negligible. It might happens in futures trading, but not options.

Norway will be the first nation to announce they're buying bitcoin en masse in early december, doubling the price in 3 days. We'll get to a ATH of $15,000 then go down a bit.
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:58:57


As I stated before, those contracts don't offer any kind of leverage. The buyer has to buy the contract, and must have the amount of money available on his account to buy a bitcoin.
Since he will get the bitcoin the day after as the bitcoin goes up or down, same thing as directly buying a bitcoin. Just more risky because you must pay the premium, and you need the bitcoin to rise more than spot + premium to win.
If this was cash settled that would be different.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:40:39

Sorry, but that's not how fractional reserve works either. Banks can actually lend 9 TIMES the amount of fiat money they got. Not 90%. They must have 10% of all the money they lended available at all time (see *reserve requirements* and *capital adequacy*).
For example, if the bank total loans equals $1 000 000 they need to have $100 000 somewhere.
They litterally create money out of thin air and profit from it, with the benediction of central banks.

You can do exactly the same with any exchange and simply buy bitcoins.

You're saying unemployed people will take their food and rent money to buy bitcoin during a financial crisis? Gotcha
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:48:56
There's no leverage, you must have the usd equivalent of the price of one btc to buy one contract (for one btc).
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:01:51
Then people will lend bitcoin, with interest. They just won't be able to create bitcoins to lend to the people who need it. And that's a pretty good thing.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:44:53
This is a bit far fetched but I get what you're saying.
Anyway this has nothing to do with a futures contract. Or an option. It's a swap.

@_date: 2017-09-16 21:42:00
proof ?
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:42:12
Because if crypto replaces fiat, people won't wait 30 years accumulating bitcoins to buy a house. An entrepreneur will need money to start his company. They will get a loan. I don't see how an economy can do well without loans.
Maybe it will be the only use of fiat money in the future, and there will never be crypto loans, I don't know.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:37:42
Why would you lend bitcoin to an unknown. 
"bitcoin banks" will do the loans. People will deposit bitcoins to earn interest, and the banks will loan bitcoins, probably at a much higher interest rate than fiat money because of scarcity.
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:24:49
Yeah, fees. Named "premium" in the document. It's equally dumb, as premiums are used for options.
To be honest, this is fishy as hell.

@_date: 2017-09-22 11:02:39
Those are not futures contracts, they are swaps. Duration is one day, so pretty short. 
You must have the USD value in the account to purchase one contract (one BTC equivalent in USD), futures usually just requires margin.


On which exchange ?
So you're basically buying one bitcoin or shorting one bitcoin. I don't get it. Why trade this instead of bitcoins directly ?
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:46:31
I can't explain it to you if you don't want to understand. Read carefully the wiki links I provided and do your research.

You're aware that nothing can get lower than -100% right ? -100% and your asset is worth 0.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:23:34
A "devaluation" is always between 0 and 100%. I understand what you're trying to say, the correct way to say it is :
a 97% devaluation would make a 2018 dollar worth 30 2020 dollars.
If you want to stick with your 3000% you could say "the basket of goods value in dollars increased 3000%", or "X currency increased 3000% in value against the dollar".
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:55:33
Well, to the universe, something that has less entropy is more valuable than something that has more entropy.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:43:00
Absolutely not, if the dollar go down 100% against the yen, for example, it would mean one dollar is exactly worth 0 yen. Also one million dollar is worth 0 yen too.
Something losing 100% of its value it something that's now worth 0. Nothing can be worth less than 0 so it's not possible to lose more value than 100% (so no -3000%, get it ?).
