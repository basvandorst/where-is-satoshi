Adoption. If you get paid in btc and pay in btc you don't have to touch  fiat anymore, so you won't worry about btc price in fiat. Therefore the whole issue "can't use btc because its price fluctuates too much" disappears. By agreeing to be paid in btc you make it easier for your employer to accept btc payments in turn.

Indeed. I was going for a very conservative estimate. As M2 is about four times M1 you'd get 2 milions per btc. Also there may be much less than 20 million btc in circulation by that time.

A 20% fluctuation of the EUR/USD exchange rate is nothing special. Fluctuations of this magnitude happened a few times over the last ten years, and you probably didn't even notice it. Maybe Camembert and Gewurtztraminer will be more expensive for a while.

Well, if it has to replace all money worldwide it's not unrealistic. The money supply M1 is 4 trillion in the US alone ( That's cash and checking accounts. Worldwide it's probably at least 10 trillion. Let's assume there are 20 million btc in circulation when all money becomes btc (this is genereous). So 10 trillion / 20 million = 500k per bitcoin. Of course there is no guarantee that bitcoin will replace the world's money supply...

How much would you charge for lending me your palantir?

He didn't. This isn't a matter of copyright, more of trademarks. You can make your own distribution of Linux, you just don't go around saying it's Ubuntu. It isn't. It's aquarient13untu.

How do you send btc you just bought from Coinbase to someone? You need an address, either as QR code or as a number. This is crazy difficult. I just want to send money to my friend mike, ok? Wtf is this address thing?
Other issues: you need to verify your identity: I know its a requirement from KYC law, but still it can be a pain. You should be pre-verified (through your facebook account, which also happens to already know who your friend Mike is? Idk). Also 2FA and misc security (e.g. remembering a password); the system should just know it's you.
On top of all of this: what if I make a mistake? You can't revert a transaction. Oh and which currency to buy? Why bitcoin instead of eth or ltc or idk what else they added to coinbase? And what about the exchange rate? I sent 12 bucks to mike for the barbecue and now they are worth 10 only, should I send him 2 more?
I understand these are not all UX issues, but ultimately all issues are also UX issues.

Seizing bitmain and all those mining operations to do what? To close them down? Then when they stop mining difficulty drops and someone else based outside of China will be able to do the mining. Or seizing them to control a large fraction of miners and attempt a 51% attack? This would prompt other countries to start their own mining operations, possibly at a loss, just to make it harder for China to control the majority of miners. It becomes a new arms race.

Coinbase is still not simple enough. Also it being a custodian service takes the whole point of Bitcoin away. We need amazing ux and real decentralization. I am not sure it will happen anytime soon.

Fees are not high anymore. Whether confirmation time is too long depends on what you are paying for. Buying a house? A few minutes for an on-chain transaction seems pretty fast to me. Buying a cup of coffee? Use the lightning network.  The only real problem you point out is insufficient adoption.

There's much more to it than that. If you read Graeber's book he shows how different societies handled economy and it very often has nothing to do with barter.

I see opportunity here. Go start an exchange yourself.
