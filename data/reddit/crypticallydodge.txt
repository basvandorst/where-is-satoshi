It’s actually because of the way they attack. A bull motions it’s head / horns up. A bear smashes its paws down. Just a way of describing the market trend of any given time frame 
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:15:20
It is most likely just a basic physiological barrier. It's a round number, I don't think there is anything more to it than that
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:40:36
Doesn’t this just correspond directly to transaction volumes? Sorry just don’t quite follow why less transactions = good news 
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:58:55
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:25:25
Cool, thanks for explaining. That makes sense

Did you do this in the end? Is a charge back basically a way for the bank to claim the funds back into your bank account?

Yep, better safe than sorry :)

I don't think that BTC and alt coins are necessarily mutually exclusive. 
Gold exists along with currencies. Currencies also exist with other currencies. 
Even if it does end up loosing market dominance that doesn't mean its a flop.
I think it will remain as the base line crypto and probably used alongside a number of other emerging techs that have different benifits
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:20:12
Why does BTC have to be the only success? 
Gold exists alongside currencies, as do other currencies.
BTC and ALTs aren't mutually exclusive IMO
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:41:58
I think if it breaks 15500 / 16000 then we will break upwards. Below 13500 / 14000 then it could dip again. Othewise it may just continue to trade sideways
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:50:02
Haha yes!!! worth every penny
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:08:26
USA has woken up and do not want BTC to go up... - How do you know its not the US pushing through the walls?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:58:17
When there is a high volume of people buying or selling at a given price it creates a "wall". Until these are met then the price won't push past the wall in whatever direction that might be

Great, thanks for clearing that up 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:05:57
I have to say it definitely shows who is emotionally stable and who isn't. All very well riding the highs but you have to pay to play. 
The best thing anyone can do is stick to their plan regardless of what that was / is. 
Anyone who is doing that, I take my hat off to you - its not easy.
No one can call this market boring
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:26:06
Go on...
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:29:31
I'm curious about the bottom mid-Jan. Don't the futures investment companies stand to loose a lot of money if it isn't 19k by mid Jan? I can't see them letting this happen
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:06:50
Easily done, plus it’s all relative... in a year or two that might turn out to be an excellent entry 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:13:09
Haha it's actually the reality. I don't personally deal in crystal balls.
Perhaps you would prefer an obligatory "We're going to the moon" or "It's game over guys, time to cash in and cut your losses"
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:26:51
Yeah sure, I understand that with the average man or woman on the street but there are plenty of people of influence and financial credibility that aggressively push against it I guess for some pretty obvious reasons. I have just never seen such obvious protection of their own interests in the media etc.. 
It makes me smile every time someone else comes out nay saying it, if it was truly a not noteworthy then no one would give it the time of day. No such thing as bad publicity :) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:48:18
US trying to make sure that we hit ~19k for mid Jan when the first futures expire?!
Trying to keep things in check as going to exceed that otherwise
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:44
Couldn't agree more. I'm no expert but seems like the most common problem people have. 
All very well preaching when thing are up but the real test is when there is a big dip and people soon show their true colours. I'm not saying HODL at all costs, just put your emotions to one side and make rational choices, slowly and surely.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:42:41
The truth always prevails
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:14:19
When Bitcoin is up they call it a bubble, when it is down they say it's crashing. I'm starting to realise that some people just don't want to see this thing succeed
@_date: 2018-09-02 05:03:03
Few days?! Try a few months
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:03:20
Weirder things have happened... take 2 hours ago for example:
"Just saw the sell wall of 700btc burnt into ashes on bitfinex" - on this very thread

That was a real suckers rally though :) Whether this one is too is yet to be determined

This is too funny!

Hahaha me too, we are witnessing history here! Remember it's just money Folks
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:36:18
Thats really good, definitely a wider lesson than Bitcoin here
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:50:50
My opinion is don't get too caught up on buying the dip. Buy it and forget about it for a while. If you have faith in the underlying technology then you are in it for the long term and will see a good return regardless
@_date: 2018-09-03 16:57:44
Good to see but the list of these cryptos that you always see at ATMs seem like they are from 2-3 years back. Shame they dont have some more up to date cryptos available (BTC excluded)
@_date: 2018-09-01 05:03:01
Yeah, the point is that is much easier said than done 
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:05:51
I don’t think you understand Bitcoin or more importantly the cryptography behind it 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:49:24
This question and most answers are symptomatic of the general public perception of Bitcoin - that it’s an investment vehicle.
I think the majority simply skip the decentralised borderless currency part which is really what makes it compelling in the first place. 
I’m not saying I can blame people, I guess money and profit rule the world (somewhat ironically)
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:03:04
It’s not rocket science and it’s free to learn so given the amount you have apparently lost then maybe invest a little time in skilling up
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:54:23
You’re done 
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:18:31
I'm not saying this is the bottom but what I previously thought to be the depression part of the hype cycle has now surpassed the previous from a few weeks / months ago.
If the general sentiment on Reddit is anything to go by then it's probably buy time

Weckingball, that you?
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:42:11
Well the OP was talking in absolutes like they knew it was going down and down. My point was just: if you are so sure then short it.
I don’t disagree that this market is volatile and hard to predict. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:27:21
Is there an easy way to view transaction volumes and differentiate between buys, sells and sells of newly mined coins. 
Not sure if such a thing exists?
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:30:09
Maybe, it may also be the best investment you ever made. Give it some decent time as with any investment. 10 months isn’t long enough to make a judgment.
Also sometimes just leaving it can be a better strategy 
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:12:40
No one knows what they are doing here, it’s a new technology class. Some people were just lucky enough to be right on this occasion. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:48:32

@_date: 2018-08-21 05:35:50
Why not short it and make your money back and more then? Come to think of it why haven’t you already? 
Seems even more dumb than the original investment if you are so convinced it’s going to go lower. With leverage you will make you money back and some with ease 
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:19:37
Calling it a ponzi is just like calling fiat a ponzi. Sure there are schemes that exist but making such a blanket statement is ignorant, there are plenty of other projects including Bitcoin that don’t fit the definition of a ponzi by any stretch. 
Also, for something that has ‘no value’ to anyone it’s done mind blowingly well for an open source project that no one has to use and could have easily died at early conception.
There is clearly something of value here, it will just take the world a bit of time to truly cotton on and see past the seemingly scammy exterior. Don’t be fooled at first glance 
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:26:20
I don’t think that has anything to do with a change in currency fundamentals but your not wrong :)
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:28:25
Sorry but that literally makes no sense to me.
I’m annoyed because I’ve lost my money... you can make it back like this... no it’s ok I’ve already lost it now. 
The reality is people like to moan about price drops but don’t have he balls or understanding to short. If that’s the case then I have zero sympathy for someone failing to understand how to trade and invest and how market cycles work.
I guess you could say it’s natural selection at its best.
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:52:47
It has nothing to do with my ability to manage money, I’m more than fine on that side of things. 
I’m simply pointing out that the current system could be better,  nothing more. 
If you disagree that’s fine, everyone is entitled to an opinion. Just don’t really understand where you are coming from but hey, such is life. 
Would you be happy if an email was sat “pending” for 3 days? Of course not, so why put up with it when it comes to money?

@_date: 2018-08-12 01:55:56
Yeah true, true. I hear ya, feels pretty hard to have capital sat there outside the space moving up or down 1% when there is so much perceived opportunity. I think it’s super common for people to get drawn in and focus only on Crypto, so hard to ignore the pull

For those calling this a sell off. Take a look at the 30 day chart: 
This is a bullish chart: Higher lows, higher highs... If it breaks significantly down then you might have the start of a point but until then this is still a promising chart in the mid term. 
Hate to use the cliche but zoom out and don't panic over short term moves

I have thought a fair bit about this and I think something fairly obvious normally gets skimmed over: if quantum computing allows for brute forcing of most passwords / encryption then crypto isn’t the only thing that has a problem..
How about every digital password in existence currently? Including online banking, eCommerce stores and personal accounts. The problem is far from limited to the crypto space which, in the big scheme of things is pretty secure by comparison

@_date: 2018-08-12 08:53:02
I think you’ve missed my point. I’m not overly worried about my personal investment, it’s pretty modest and I have good income. It’s more the difference between the potential I see in the space and the current market cap / price

I am for real. Obviously I’m able to do that but I shouldn’t have to, that’s mental.
By that logic why do you have a balance on you account at all? Why don’t you just add up the individual transactions and get the total? Anyone can do this but why would you when it’s not needed.
What I’m getting at is a true, real time balance. I guess some people just don’t like change (facepalm).

I have a theory. Big investors know that 10k+ means fomo from the small time investors and therefore will continue to dump and accumulate in the 8-10k region until it’s squeezed dry then we will see a new high 
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:35:28
Sure but this still provides a massive incentive for those longing / shorting to buy and sell BTC on the side which on its own means a large possibility of seeing new money hitting the space

Well, that’s a fact. The term bear and bull are relative to the timescale you are looking at.

Whales trying to flush weak hands out must be seriously suffering from diminishing returns at this point. Who is phased by 6, 5 or even 4k BTC?

Then you shouldn’t be investing it, especially in an asset class that is notoriously volatile and in its infancy. There are plenty of safer investments with smaller potential returns.

Being in the majority isn’t a good thing all the time. I actually think it’s better to be completely emotionally detached from money, it makes it easier to think objectively and at the end of the day not to take it too seriously.

Some context? How many is 1000 nodes compared to a number that might signal widespread adoption?
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:41:57
erm, ok
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:17:53
It's a gradual process like segwit so there isn't really a go live moment. 
There are however around 1000 lightning network nodes live on mainnet already yes
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:04:21
Have you had a look around here and in this past few days? Despair and hopeless is absolutely everywhere haha 
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:41:59
Come again?
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:42:33
Ok, well if its a choice between hodling or trying to make money by second guessing the market at the moment. I'm 100% with the former, that's my point.
If you think you can make money out of this market, good luck to you
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:40:38
Haha yep, I’m believer way beyond just price. 
Good to make up you own mind and believe in yourself enough not to be swayed by the masses. Here’s hoping it pays off 
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:29:23
I would guess at this point it is more to do with vendor adoption.
i.e Companies that provide interfaces / solutions to pay using LN
This then provides utility to the end user. I'm sure there are plenty of people working on it
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:17:19
Cheer up lads, let’s not get over dramatic about a little price movement. Those who have been here a while know that this is just another day

Ok right, so back to my original question... is there a figure that would reflect widespread adoption? Just trying to get a rough picture 
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:59:54
Well said
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:16:34
If this thing does end up breaking down, then no one can say it’s due to a lack of bullish fundamentals this past week. 
If it has to break down then so be it, I for one feel that BTC is looking as good as ever with a bright future 
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:37:42
"Ownership of BTC is so high that it's price is easily manipulated by a few" - that is the status quo for our current financial system. BTC is an improvement on this though for a number of reasons.
One where banks don't use my money to make money then charge me for the privilege. A change in the financial business model. 
BTW, nothing wrong with a good mantra :)
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:56:16
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:59:14
Oh I’m sorry, not sure what I was thinking. What I meant to say was - this is it guys, game over the price dropped $400, this market sucks, might as well sell and give up. What’s the point...
That better for you? :) 
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:15:42

Remind me again. Why “Must” Bitcoin price continue to drop?
Oh yeah because it’s been trending that way for a while. Such an arbitrary reason but I guess it’s the name of the game. 
Seems to have nothing to do with fundamentals IMO

Cool, ok you showed me. Lets just leave everything as it is then.

I often read comments referring to the people who brought at the ATH being weak hands who won't stick around much longer... I mean if you held from ~19k through 4.5k and back up I'd say you pretty much qualify as a Hodler now. 
I personally think 'weak hands' were shaken out in Dec / Jan.

Well, at least long term Hodlers are risking getting involved in this shit storm. Granted the price is fluctuating but not loosing until you sell.

I don’t think you can apply anyone one thought process to millions of people who think independently and have different objectives. 
What I am sure about is that I see massive value in the tech and believe in it so think it can only grow
I take it you are shorting BTC then?! If you are right then I guess youll be making some good money

Yep totally true. This is what an investment is though, deciding if you think the product / tech is under or over priced and making a choice off the back of that. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:29:51
Yeah can’t imagine why they might be bias against Crypto at all. Just an impartial company making a fair statement ��
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:10:48
Bitcoin has the longest history of any blockchain, survived most attacks and is the most known entity. 
Often being first is more important than being ‘best’.
Nothing is a given in this space but it’s no 1 marketcap with good reason. I don’t personally see this changing for a while

Yes true, TBH I have included that in my thought process. We have had nothing but FUD for months and it continues. I just feel that people get numb to these scare tactics after a while which on the whole is what they are. Over dramatised headlines like "South Korea bans bitcoin" which is undeniably false information.

The best advice I can give: dollar cost average in and spread your risk! 
There really is no need to make such a bold move and put everything in at once 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:58:28
Just think of this: Every time you panic and sell BTC that's a little bit more lost to big institutions who are buying up as much as possible at the moment. Goldman Sachs are publicly calling for a sell off and literally buying when people do.
Crazy how straight up devious these organisations are
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:30:18
Sound, seems like a nice guy

@_date: 2019-01-26 20:31:55
It’s odd because he acknowledged that computer scientists have managed to create something that is extremely hard to “make more of”, something that hasn’t been done before yet almost immediately says it has no intrinsic value.. that is a contradiction in my eyes.
He also says we don’t need it. It’s very simple, if it wasn’t needed then why would an open source project continue to exist, quite simply it wouldn’t.
Not to mention the many reasons it has advantages over gold in a digital era, micropayments and decentralisation. 
Saved for a later to date, I have a feeling I’ll enjoy watching this back one day :)

I don't really care about the TA right now, IMO Bitcoin is extremely under valued at the moment.
* JP Morgan and BOA have both published that Cryptocurrencies are a "threat" to their business model
* Segwit adoption is growing by the day
* Lightning Network nodes on mainnet continue to grow
* The pull back that every analyst was calling for has happened (probably), 
* BTC is at 40% dominance for the first time in a while 
This thing is about to pop again

I totally agree. Isn’t this just what banks were originally for? Somewhere secure to store your assets so they aren’t under your mattress? 
It’s just that fractional reserve banking changed the model and made banks into what they are today

@_date: 2018-02-12 10:42:51
I think there have been worst times to buy
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:24:28
Dumping non stop - not strictly true but I get it, feels bad but it’s not like pre Dec 2017 things were always stable. 
This is 100% typical of BTC price movement when you look at various stages of its 8 year growth. It’s actually been a lot worse in the past! 
If you are only comparing to an isolated 2 month bull run then it won’t seem very optimistic
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:47:07
Be humble 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:28:56
Don't, no one held a gun to their heads. Atleast I hope not :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:44:10
Don’t let them get your coins guys, it’s madness to sell right now 
Don’t believe the hype 
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:41:21
It has gained over 15% total value in a little over 48 hours. I'd say a few hundred dollar pull back is to be completely expected
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:50:01
I guess not, we may even see an increase in the % increase too so could be even quicker 
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:11:24

By the same logic, anyone investing in an online business is linked to it too
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:18:18
Lets remember it's not all about price. 
BTC is here to stay and is going to change the financial world as we know it, adoption just takes time.
We have only just begun 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:07:34
What amount would signal a critical mass of adoption?  Roughly speaking - 10BTC? 50BTC? 1000BTC? Hard to gauge this from what I’ve read 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:35:30
Everything but the past is speculation
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:37:29
This is awesome, I love that people are calling these accounts out. If you are short on BTC of course that's fine. 
If you are spreading stupid, false information or trying to manipulate or scare people then you are going to get called out!
Keep up the good work guys
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:02:30
Yep I am completely bought into the fundamentals of BTC. Nothing is guaranteed especially with such a disruptive tech but f**k it, I'd rather look back in 20 years and think I was on the side of something that stood against large centralised institutions taking their slice of everyone's money. 
The principles matter more to me than money at this point. Do your worst 
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:54:28
I think that arguement had a lot more weight when BTC was $10
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:04:45
I’m in the UK too and although Coinbase has had a lot of bad press for various political and other reasons (rightly so) I would say that out of the many exchanges I’ve used as a customer it does ‘feel’ safe. It is backed by proper funding and touch wood probably not going to disappear over night. Remember you only have to use it (or Gdax - same company) as an on or off ramp to buy with.
Once you have purchased you are best off getting an offline Ledger and moving it there any way. That way you have complete control 
@_date: 2019-01-25 06:52:27

@_date: 2018-02-06 18:11:58
Yeah you're right. Must be bad, if only there was some other way than checking on Reddit to find that information out :)
Not directed at the OP just this comment.
Not bad at all but is obviously subjective. I found it to be pretty reassuring and not negative by any stretch. 
Basically they want to prevent fraud and scams and do seem to have a grasp on the potential growth and magnitude of the tech.

@_date: 2018-03-27 06:49:39
Even better 
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:54:00
Honestly if you take a step back, things are looking too bright for BTC right now to get caught up in the drama of price swings. It’s actually pretty funny reading some of the doom and gloom on this daily. I guess everyone is entitled to an opinion
Fear about regulation etc is nothing in comparison to the potential of this tech. What a time to be alive!
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:02:47
Ahhhhhh I now understand. Thank you! God bless Reddit 
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:04:22

Yeah, but BTC does kind of have a habit of defying reason and convention though. 1 month is an eternity here
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:53:19
Surely if one is concerned about competition from other crypto currencies then it’s one of the most important metrics?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:01
It's your money, you should be able to do what you want with it... oh wait
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:07:13
Think it happens at 10am EST and there is a live feed somewhere. Not sure about the impact. Not even sure that news is having much impact at this point
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:39:36
No, it's only just begun
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:08:31
Yeah I do agree. It’s crazy to me that politics and BCH investment money would impact what is best for the industry.
The good thing is there is unbiased competition emerging and Coinbase will ultimately suffer 
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:19:43
Are you shorting BTC by any chance? hahahahaha
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:41:52
Is it still a bull trap? :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:35:10
Regulation and government run are completely different things 
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:40:23
Really curious how much of a battle breaking through will be. Things can change quickly with resistance and withdrawal or big sell walls 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:02:04
My theory is that it is to fulfil shorts made by futures contracts. At 4pm GMT I guess we'll find out if that's true (thats when this months futures expire)
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:36:22
 still down though
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:37:40
haha busted. The door is that way --&gt;
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:32:27
I guess some people are just suckers for punishment
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:33:25
In my head this is said in a Michael Caine accent which makes it even better
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:45:01
Haha I don’t have the authority unfortunately ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:57:48
The thing is as well, someone is always right. Then people go around thinking they have it dialled 
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:48:31
2017 was Bitcoin’s year.
2018 is also Bitcoins year.
Every year is Bitcoins f* year!!!
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:04:10
You rule :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:51:01
Late is a relative term 
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:03:24
Because both centralised and decentralised models both have a time and place depending on the use case 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:04:57
A change in sentiment, thats it. 
Markets are extremely complex and although its natural to assign a reason to everything often there is no one clear cause. 
Its nice and tidy for the media / people to say "its because of X or Y" but I personally don't think it's that easy
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:14:48
Haha I mean who seriously gives a flying f**k that twitter are banning crypto adds. 
It really has no significance in the long term. 
In fact the word crackdown just makes me think they are just another company worried about how it will affect their (centralised) business model 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:48:43
If you read it in more detail you would see that they can only halt operations in Japan at absolute worst and Binance are based in Hong Kong not Japan. The Japanese govenment simply don't have the authority to do anything more than that.
Japan accounts for around 7% of their customers. So I'd hold off on the $6.5k chat for now. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:01:04
Right, makes sense but then didn’t the people that purchased USDT just pay ~1 USD per coin anyway? Or are you saying people printed USDT and then used it to buy Bitcoin for essentially nothing 
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:49:57
Maybe this is just what BTC looks like when whales aren't pumping and dumping? 
It's so unusual that no body knows what to do with themselves
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:53:35
You don’t know what I know 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:23:18
Where do you guys watch the volume? On Coinmarketcap or Gdax itself?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:27:55
I'm at the point where I know what I believe and I know the tech. If the price tanks, so be it but that doesn't change a thing from it's potential and the problem it solves. 
FUD is water off a ducks back at this stage haha
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:14:34
The truth has a habit of prevailing 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:36:52
Nice work
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:36:16
It would be lovely if everyone could put their egos to one side for a few moments and admit, no one has a single clue what is going to happen next.
It's literally all guess work with some people having a very very slight benefit of some experience. It's still a stab in the dark.
If it was easy as 'figuring out the answer' then it wouldn't be the volatile market it is. 
I think the only way to survive is to have a strategy then don't let your emotions mess with it
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:46:13
This guy is a fraud just check out his post history (not that you should need to in order to know that!)
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:36:40
Does anyone know what time the futures contracts end today? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:59:20
Who are you calling greedy and who says I’m buying now? Hehe 
As per the second part of my post... I’ve nothing against anyone looking to buy cheaper Bitcoin, more power to you. It’s the aggressive ‘game over / BTC is dead’ chat that I really want to call out 
@_date: 2018-03-24 06:53:03
So now you just hang out on a crypto sub instead?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:43:43
I would interpret that as when an equilibrium / concusses between buy and sell price is reached 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:46:04
No probs. Interested to see if this makes any impact on price / opinion I’m either direction, if at all 
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:35:53
Come again?
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:53:00
Oh yeah, we all sold at $19,500 didnt we ;) 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:10:44
It's not breaking news... The video is dated from March 7th
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:40:42
I mean, I get your point but saying you own 1 BTC is like saying “I have a credit card”. 
It’s basically just admitting you have access to $3.4k 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:19:08
Good for you, too many emotions flying around at the moment 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:33:21
Thank you, that does look very suspicious
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:57:41
Ah I kind of get it. So it’s being treated as a ‘stable coin’ if that’s the right term. But if that does turn out to be true I don’t really see why that would do anything but just kill USDT. I mean personally I wouldn’t care less 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:45:17
I don’t think trades are open yet but not sure when they are.  I read around the end of Feb.
Perhaps someone else knows the exact date? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:39:24
Well, it depends on your view of cryptocurrencies. This is the end doom and gloom or they are here to stay.
Not everyone buys high and sells low you know :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:09:48
Hahaha ok brother / sister ur on 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:21:30

@_date: 2018-03-30 09:34:06
Yeh this guys is a serial fudster 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:12:10
I don’t like it and no doubt there is some tactical moves going on in the background however you can’t really be annoyed that you aren’t allowed to spend someone else’s money. 
If they ban people from using money in a current account that is a completely different story 
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:59:35
Hmmm why do I get the funny feeling you might be a fraud? :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:39:53
Touché 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:57:30
Username checks out
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:54:09
Yeah its a fair point and I'm not disagreeing. 
Like I said, I don't think that everyone is going to suddenly jump into crypto currencies but my point was I think the net result would be positive as opposed to negative.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:31:04
I think there should be a name and shame
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:13:41
I should really say, I’ve nothing against anyone buying BTC high or low. If you’re with BTC then you are cool with me 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:44:20
Cool, watch what happens to the money on that debit card while in the bank when interest rates are lower than inflation... 
(I also use contactless but have seen a glimpse of a brighter future)
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:25:40
So you are saying no of nodes is not a useful metric?
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:45:19
Haha I thought that might have lasted atleast a few days. Onwards....
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:42:42
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:09:19
Yes of course, goes the same for that too. I've just found generally the panic sell advice tends to be more aggressive
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:49:50

@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:21
Best comment ever. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:43:51
Bad is a relative term. It's doing pretty darn good in the big scheme of things
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:49:06
Ah right, with you now. Thank you for clarifying. I guess that’s why they were kind of vague with their original announcement 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:56:21
Kind of walked into that one :) 
I’m more thinking in terms of the underlying principles and potential rather than today specifically. 
Technology doesn’t always come fully baked is my point. Look what the internet looked like in 1997... a bunch of coloured hyperlinks. Now we can watch HD movies from a phone
Its is a glimpse of a better future where other people don’t get rich off of your money
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:03:51
Sorry man, U know I’m only playing haha nothing but love really
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:08:06


@_date: 2018-02-05 10:34:27
That is true however I think most experienced investors realise that the price of Bitcoin and the recent pull back makes it more appealing than it was at ~19k.
I don't think people will flock to Crypto but I do think there will be positive trickle down to it especially if there is a moderate turn for the upside
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:43:19
Volume is mostly nonsense and an illusion created by wash trading anyway

@_date: 2018-03-19 16:59:45
Because that is human nature. It feels safer buying higher when everyone else is doing the same thing, it is extremely hard to do the opposite of the crowd. 
It's an inbuilt evolutionary trait designed for survival
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:40:13
and again... I think you are a scammer PawelKrakow
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:41:34
Exactly what I'm afraid of :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:32:30
Yeah totally agree, if there are any 'weak hands' they already sat through a drop to ~6k so no chance they can still be considered weak if they are still here.  
Weak hands can't stomach 3 months of downtrend
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:22:39
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:00:36
Not really, I think you could apply the comment to any given one week period in BTC’s history! Just another day
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:14:53
Judgement clouds greed 
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:54:21
Not sure what you mean, so the fear only applies to people that bought BTC with Tether?
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:33:34
Maybe its both
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:41:15
See ya
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:25:10


Pretty average
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:36:38
I think part of the problem with peoples opinions here is applying logic of other markets to one that almost no one understands.
I heard it put well by someone the other day that it is extremely rare if not unheard of that a ‘new’ technology is made so publicly available for investment. 
If you take the average tech start up for comparison the chance to invest is normally reserved for the likes of business angels and venture capitalist not Joe public. 
All of a sudden you get a bunch of people, including me thinking that things look good or bad with no real experience in how ‘things like this’ really work in the long term or where we truely we in terms of the cycle 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:11:14
Change as many of the passwords for the online stuff as you can. That would be a good start.
Also if the wallet is on the laptop and not the web then use the seed to recover the wallet then transfer the funds to a new one 
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:39:28
Just remember, no matter what the situation there is always opportunity. There were a ton of people asking for cheap coins at $10k+ 
If this isn't what you wanted then maybe more careful what you wish for
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:45:31
Ok, you are off the hook :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:32:13
Nah and fair enough. My main point is think for yourself don’t be swayed in either direction by sensationalism 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:24:30
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:45:07
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:11:05
Ah yes, thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:57:02
Don't worry, greed will kick in soon enough and panic will ensue
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:01:41
Yeah, I agree. You aren't really buying BTC when you do so through Robinhood.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:26:02
Yep I know they aren't the best exchange out there and have been suspected of various things however they are one of the biggest and this combined with the Segwit roll out is at least a positive sign
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:56:41
Interesting, thanks for sharing

That’s 32 less millionaires that will have 1
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:19:21
Nice this is been on my mind to do but timing is everything I guess as there is some risk involved. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:56:11
If either of those are true I reckon the problem existed before Bitcoin came along
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:12:16
Yes and the next few days are critical 
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:43:41
Did they? As in a few weeks? Any links?
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:46:38
Yeah I agree, this matters for merchants and that’s ultimately what will drive adoption especially in the world of eCommerce
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:28:45
I'm thinking futures and not saying it is directly responsible but funny how futures were introduced just before the bull turned to bear in Dec. 
In a market that is easily manipulated by whales its not too much of a stretch to think that shorters are deliberately pushing the price down until futures expire. 
I'm surprised this isn't a more talked about subject.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:16:15
The next few days are *always* critical 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:39:34
haha this guy... 
In your dreams bud
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:28:42
Yeah, who is everyone in debt too?
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:15:17
That’s it. I’ve finally had enough, this bear market is taking this thing right down. It’s over with, all you bulls are delusional if you think it’s ever going to go back up. I’m selling all my BTC and going to find something else to invest my money in.....
Just kidding, I’m not selling for anything or anyone! My timeline is 5-20 years and even longer if it make sense. A decentralised currency that doesn’t need a traditional banking authority to operate.. what a time to be alive 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:34:31
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:04:11
Always ask yourself, what is the motivation behind what someone is telling you. 
All these posts saying "get out while you can" spreading the FUD, clear hidden agendas IMO
Brush it off and stick to your own plan, think for yourself and don't make snap, rash decisions that you will later regret. 
Just sayin

@_date: 2018-04-26 10:56:26
Weird that you feel compelled to come to a Bitcoin sub to say that though. 
Do you do the same for everything that you consider a risky investment or did you personally get burnt? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:06:26
Lol anyone who thought anything that didn’t turn out to be true could be classed as delusional. Getting things wrong is part of being human and it’s no crime

@_date: 2018-04-01 14:16:36
I watch someone buy 1250 BTC yesterday which came in around $8.5m.
That’s insane. From a skeptics point of view I guess it could be some sort of manipulation? 
Or maybe more likely to be an exchange making some sort of move?
Interested to hear peoples opinion on that 
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:43:16
Just staying above the downward trend line is a nice win for bulls right now 
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:51:48
Haha fair enough, can’t argue with that 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:32:35

That isn’t what a lot of TA ‘experts’ have been saying for the past few weeks. In fact the vast majority I’ve read have been saying sub 6k was inevitable and many calling for 4,3,2 and even 1k in line with the downtrend.
To be fair that hasn’t been broken yet but I’d definitely question that there was a consensus of a bottom being reached / the recent move up being very predictable  
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:38:59
Haha well remembered, hats off to ya you were right

You can’t say anything with certainty in this market especially right now, it’s just pretending to know.
OP dollar cost averaging is a much safer way to invest
Exchange.. depends where you are and what’s available but Coinbase / Gdax, kraken and Binance have all been good to me 
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:58:06
People worried about calling the bottom right now:
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:54:16
It wouldn’t make a noticeable impact on price. People are regularly buying and selling 1000s of BTC
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:58:40
So enlightening going back to old reddit posts around ATL and ATH and reading people’s comments and predictions.
One thing to bear in mind (no pun intended) is that the people nay saying and pointing out logical reasons that the price “can’t” move in a certain direction are wrong time and time again. 
It’s not that their arguments don’t make sense, it’s the following price movement that doesn’t without hindsight. 
Just remember this next time someone here is talking in absolutes about the future of BTC
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:11:03
Knowing is one thing, buying at that point when it would probably have felt like a complete scam with no history then holding throughout 2 brutal bear markets.. seems like it would take a madman or idiot. Fair play to anyone that did 
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:08:53
When it was high or when you were high?
@_date: 2018-12-31 09:02:43
Here in lies the difficulty in profiting from any asset class. People will always say “I wish I’d bought at x price” but it’s said out of context. When the price does drop not many have the capacity to see beyond their natural instincts and opt to avoid the risk.
It seems like a right time right place thing but ultimately takes an emotionally stable person with true belief in the tech even when it appears hopeless
