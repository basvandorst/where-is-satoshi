I think you need to rescan the block chain.. basically adding a key to a wallet does nothing to automatically find the transactions. Normally as it is running all transactions are checked against the wallet and any relevant ones are copied to the wallet. But there is nothing looking for historical transactions. If you make a new tx it might appear though.

IP blocking would be totally ineffective.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:59:51
If you want incoming you would need to setup a hidden service in tor.. that would be separate from the bitcoin socks stuff.. the tor daemon will connect to port 8333 on localhost when someone accesses the hidden service. You can use the external IP parameter to bitcoind to make it advertise the tor hidden service address. See

There should be a large drop in onchain transactions once ln is available as an alternative.

@_date: 2018-01-08 10:15:57
Yes at the moment.. once it's free and instant to move BTC I expect that to change. For inter exchange transfers a relatively small portion of exchange custodial assets would be needed, similar to the existing hot wallet. I don't really know why exchanges haven't already made their own private transfer system as it could be done without ln too.. but since they seem to lack the initiative, probably they will just implement ln and allow transfers to anyone.

Edit: here is the actual memo 
It is an odd document. It doesn't so much say that they are banning bitcoin as it may infringe on existing foreign exchange rules. It seems to me like that would not apply if you bought the bitcoins locally.. and certainly not if you mined them. The last paragraph says they look forward to watching how cryptocurrency develops in Morocco.. clearly they don't expect their memo to stop it.

The most likely outcome is that mining will become unprofitable and only be done to generate heat and in that way can become much more widely distributed as homes will outcompete centralised mining operations (as not many uses for large amounts of waste heat - just enough to heat a house or water heater). I don't think mining will ever be useful computationally as that would make it easier to game, but it might eventually have to compete with more useful computational applications that also generate waste heat.. limiting it to some fraction of the global heating market in terms of eventual energy consumption.

People who sold futures bought BTC to cover their short. Initially futures were more expensive so they made a risk free profit on the difference. But when the futures matured they all sold their BTC to pay off their futures. That makes the price go down.. also many people anticipated this and sold as well.

Easily. Most transactions at the moment are moving BTC between exchanges. Literally all of those would go away. I'm not sure what ln Devs monolithic hive opinion is.. the us fedwire processes all USD clearing in the world using less transactions than onchain bitcoin already delivers. Building payment systems on top of that should be workable.

LN will work in the short term with 1mb.. and with a few more tricks (combining channel opens/closings, and multi party  channels ) maybe long term too. If not litecoin and other ln capable coins can be used for lower value storage.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:20:05
In theory, couldn't multiple ln channels be closed as one transaction? Similarly, multiple could be opened in one transaction. Also with mast maybe you could have more than two parties to a payment channel.

This is probably what you'd call a federated side chain. Maybe you could have a federation inside a side channel though. It requires some trust since the majority of the federation can steal the channel.

Just round down to the nearest satoshi. It's a satoshi - you don't care about one. If there are 1btc worth of sub satoshi payments inside a channel you do care about them, but you can still round down to the nearest satoshi.

Rounding down and yes they may lose almost 1 satoshi when the payment channel closed. That doesn't matter though. Closing the channel will cost hundreds of satoshi so what's 0.99 more.

Bitcoin has an obfuscation key on the database so that you can't just read the database files to access data that someone might have included.. this was done mainly to stop false positives in antivirus software when someone included a virus signature.. but it also means it will always require a special client to access such data.

Good point.. but as long as you trust your next hop payment channel node not to mess with their ECC random vector it should work fine. So for example if your wallet has a payment channel with coinbase there's not much risk. Ironic that it may require some trust/centralisation, but it's still practical I think. I guess the other issue is that coinbase wouldn't fund the channel. It could be two way but only to the extent that the customer wallet funded it.

Volume weighted average of some set of exchanges last trade price. Where volume is the daily or weekly BTC volume - so more voluminous exchanges influence the price more. That's why they setup no fee exchanges (like the Korean ones) in order to claim enormous volume of trades and thus set the price. Some price averages attempt to combat this by excluding no fee exchanges from the calculations.

Well most bitcoin websites are encrypted using Https so neither your ISP or your VPN provider can read them. On the other hand most bitcoin sites are hosted behind a ddos mitigation provider called cloudflare who can read everything regardless of whether or not you use a VPN. Vpns might be slightly better from a trust perspective than open WiFi but they don't help much and most likely they're all wiretapped or run by intel agencies.

Imo they didn't really invent it, ln is just correspondent banking implemented in a smart contract.. the main reason it didn't happen many years ago is because bitcoin needed cltv and segwit before it was possible.. and before that there was not enough actual usage to justify a second layer payment network.
maybe it's surprising an ether implementation didn't manage to take over in the meantime.
The core solution would always have looked like this regardless who got credit for inventing it

The only control LR has is it can opt not to process a transaction, in which case the channel will be closed onchain with the customer getting their funds that way, and then they can either open a channel to some other node or send the payment directly onchain to the intended recipient. It's a pretty limited 'control' that just allows them to selectively annoy their customer and potentially cause them a large onchain fee by refusing service. I'm sure they will lawyer up, but I'm confident they would not be considered a custodian.. less sure about money transmission.. however exchanges are typically Mt licensed to cover their fiat operations not the crypto side. If that precedent holds they may not need a license.

Bitcoin confirmations always made bitcoin bad for e-commerce and made it almost impossible for in person use. Ln gives you an instant purchase finality. It can now be used as conveniently as a credit card with no fraud risk for the merchant. It may take a little while for wallet software to catch up, but it really is a better solution than anything else for payments. There may be some issues about too much centralisation and with analytics companies profiling people's transactions, but it will allow bitcoin to reach and exceed visa levels and imo this is likely to happen sooner than most people think. I think we were complacent on scaling for a long time as there didn't seem to be a solution, but ln now exists and it works.. all that's left is widescale deployment and that can happen fast.

Probably in theory there's no reason you couldn't boot up a parallel forkd ln, but because it would require all or a lot of the same nodes to coordinate, it's unlikely to happen. Edit: on second thoughts there is a problem. Basically the same channel states would be on both sides, so once the channel state updates on one side, that can be used to burn the channel on the other side and take all the funds.

But it's per year in .nl - not just once when selling ("realising a gain"). In theory maybe you should be paying that 0.8% on all your holdings included btc when they are just sitting in your wallet.. and you're paying it every year regardless of whether it went up or down in relative value to last year. The .nl system is very unusual
. maybe not bad, but it's difficult to compare with other tax systems.. and certainly not by comparing the headline rates.

Loads of people are trying to come up with use cases.. the two you cite seem to be bad use cases that suffer from exactly what I was saying - they have external dependencies.

Imo the only reason to do non cryptocurrency applications on a Blockchain is to conveniently integrate them with cryptocurrency payments. Cryptocurrency lives only on the Blockchain, it has no external dependencies and thus can be entirely subject to the rules of the system. Equity or debt tokens depend on the unreliable actions of real people who will never blindly follow the rules of the system. I can't really think of any non currency use cases that don't have dependencies outside the Blockchain.

When you connect to any node it can tell you other nodes it has seen. You can then try connecting to them, and they will also hear about you from the node(s) you are connected too. Over time everyone learns about everyone. To bootstrap the process the nodes used to join an irc channel, many altcoins still do this, but in bitcoin it has been replaced with DNS seeds which are simply well known DNS names that return a few random nodes to get started. Another option is to distribute a prepopulated peers.dat file containing a lot of known peers.
