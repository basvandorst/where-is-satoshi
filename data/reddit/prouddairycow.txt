This happened to me, even though I provided all the requested information. Solution: use a good exchange, Coinbase is garbage &amp; treats their customers poorly. Have never had a problem with

Coinbase treated me like garbage after doing six figures of business with them. NEVER AGAIN

Glad you have time to screenshot every random thing you find on the Internet
It turned out the guy who got me into that site was a conman, even tho I knew him since 2006 &amp; was sleeping on his couch. I thought it was already deleted

I am not abroad, and I told them where I would be on vacation
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:44:06
I did, was told there would be no problems by multiple people in multiple departments

Hello ! We have been going hard mining full time since Occupy Wall St in March of 2011

I have been having issues with them lately too, huge fan for years

Coinbase also treats some of their best customers like garbage
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:17:32
can someone prove minr.bz is not a cloud mining operation like they claim? I put 25 of my own BTC in, have withdrawn 32+ BTC
have not convinced anyone to do anything, just sharing my experience &amp; asking opinions, I stated very clearly I don't trust them.
I don't have anyone in my affiliate chain, not into MLM

Kraken, and yes Chase account was connected
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:58:14
I actually did call 47 times

I forwarded this to my *fantastic* attorney, who also accepts Bitcoin directly

THANK YOU so much, sent reddit gold (pending)
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:55:47
This is all the information I have at the moment
@_date: 2016-12-18 15:39:48
I make profits @ minr.bz, not the other one he gave me
I ain't involved in any crime, some weird dood hit me up on FB, I told him to fuck off
I use keepkey &amp; trezor

good to know
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:59:11
apparently it is true, this is the only thing that makes any sense at this point
@_date: 2016-12-17 20:00:41
didn't ask about making money, asked if anyone had any thoughts

These guys are crooks. My ex friend who is a life style grifter is working for them, he openly admits it is a Ponzi scam. He is translating their website to English bc it is a bunch of guys from Hong Kong, they made him the regional manager or something
@_date: 2016-12-18 06:41:37
Do you see the responses in this thread. I am verging on a nervous breakdown over this Chase thing. And people getting all paranoid I've been a redditor since almost the beginning &amp; digg before that. New account bc I started using password manager right before putting all my stuff in storage &amp; switched accounts. Miner since 2011 to this day &amp; I would poast my company but don't want these freaks stalking me..some guy even screenshotted my profile &amp; posted on imgur already. This is why reddit has a huge image problem

This is not true, I called to confirm charges many times this week
