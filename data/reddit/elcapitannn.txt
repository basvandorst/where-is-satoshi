Noob question, what makes monero so anonymous compared to bitcoin, do you believe governments would try to crack down on it in the future ?
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:34:31

oh dang, so could it actually be litecoin ?? wasnt there a release last week about a board member being hired to litecoins teams and all the selling of litecoin matching up to not counter interests ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:33
I think the price will rise as soon as the governments get rid of the bad exchanges,
Ponzi schemes, etc.. that give wall street the green light to enter the market.
There is so much counterfeit fiat currency in the world, that in the future the banks will probabaly adopt their on crypto currency for each country
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:15:33
does this mean some thing like, they are manipulating both sides of the price ? like how wall street lets you place bets on derivatives, and then on 2 and 3 rd level derivatives ?

Hi, can you recommend any good passive income coins? The only one I know if kucoin shares, which can give up to 100,000 in yearly dividends but thy have to reach 3 trillion in daily volume, and with new exchanges coming up daily I’m not sure if they will be able to reach that. I saw there was a binance token but I thought that was for a discount on fees and no dividend. Aside from that I’m not sure which other tokens offer dividends. Any help would
Be appreciated, thank you

Billions of people already use Facebook so they would probably give everyone a Facebook wallet and you are already have a base of billions to trade with,
It would be one of the fastest coins to reach top 100.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:25:08
that would be cool, but didnt charlie lee sell all his litecoin because it would be considered a "conflict of interest " due to some facebook board member joining the litecoin team, and charlie taking a "new job " ? not trying to spread fud, just curious if this is true and matches up
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:36:27
Lol I’m never doing that again !
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:19:31
can you trade on the japan exchange of bitflyer and be exempt from the USA trading taxes since bitcoin is regarded as a legal currency in japan ?
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:11:32
yeah whats the deal with people selling paper wallets foe 99 cents, doesnt shipping costs 49 cents, plus paypal 30 cents, and ebay fees 10 cents.
so 90 cents.... are people selling paper wallets literally just waiting till someone puts a large amount on a paper wallet and swiping the funds ? because ive seen some sellers with over 40 sales per listing
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:56:05

will i be able to store ALL coins on ETHOS or BREAD as an offline wallet once their project is complete ? as opposed to  nano s if that also supports a large percentage of alt coins and tokens
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:01:27
would a bitcoin get destroyed or lost on the chain by sending with only 20 satoshi ? i did a custom send the other day during my first send because i thought a 500 per byte satoshi fee was some kind of error. and its been stuck on the chain for over a week.
then i sent another piece of a bitcoin at 500 satoshi per byte and it literally transfered in 5 mins. and that was the normal or economy price. t he high priority price was 900 satoshi per byte
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:32:31
is it true that the government will tax you on everysingle trade for the new 2018 tax laws. like even btc to verge is one trade. then verge to btc then btc to usd in 5 years for cash outs would count as 3 trades...... or can you avoid all this by cashing out under 20,000 from coinbase, like with selling on ebay and paypal. under 20k paypal doesnt report earning because its considered a "yard sale"

your 1st sentence is the same length as mine, you wasted the same amount of time as me by making everyone read it; when you could just written your second sentence.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:54:58
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:40:27
that sounds right, but aren't large banks, and many world governments buying tremendous amounts of bitcoin that vastly overwhelm the purchasing power of regular people ?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:46:36
thanks for that notice ! i was hoping it would save me from electrical expenses, but i will look into small rigs for ethereum. and for bitcoin what are your thoughts on the antminer S9 @ 13TH for $3,000.
using a bitmain powersupply , or the EVGA 1600w Platinum PSU ?
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:37:43
i just booked a few flights on there and didnt even know, but im more of a HODLr so i'd probably spend it there once the price has stabilized in a few years.

The my Gox* trustee has 135,000
Bitcoins, he only sold like 400 million worth last time,l and you saw what it did to the market. and his current total is 1.4 billion. Hopefully he invests it into Alts
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:52:31
are there instructions on how to do this for newbies ?
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:28:46
Thanks, I’m trying to figure out how long till we can get back over 18,000 per coin.
The last sell off really tanked the market
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:55:37
so is this the same concept as the ETHOS wallet, but slightly better ? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:18:26
There must be a disturbance in the force, Bitcoin has gone up 9% in the past one hour
