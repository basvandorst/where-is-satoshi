By your metrics, if Roger Ver was supporting Core/Segwit then Core/Segwit would be questionable because of Roger Ver's support.

Don't claim to be any sort of expert, but I thought Bitcoin was whatever the longest chain is? So... if Antminer really wanted, given that they produce the S5, couldn't they stop selling the hardware temporarily and dump it all instead into their mines, and begin to produce a longer chain in a matter of short time? 
Has Bitcoin core done any sort of outreach with the Antminer people in an effort to sway them away from this apparent impending chaotic time? 
I know this whole thing has been going on for years. I'm also not happy with the response from Bitcoin Core. But overall it seems there is a plan in place... 
Isn't it possible for everyone involved to subtract the drama and get back on mission?
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:21:58
It's ad hominem because it relates to the person rather than what they are currently supporting. Roger's a liar, sure. That's not, in and of itself, a valid reason to discount the ideas he is currently in favor of. ivanraszl is merely saying that it's more productive to focus on the perceived flaws with Bitcoin Unlimited rather than devolve into personal attacks or dredging up people's pasts. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:19:13
That doesn't detract from my point. There are plenty of people who have not made the kind of grandstanding lies that Roger has who feel that scaling solutions involve more than the "because I said so" sort of logic we're seeing around these parts. Roger himself would lose significant money if the price of Bitcoin were to plummet, so I feel that overall the hatred and attacks against him are more than unproductive, but also retarded, at least regards the current "existential crisis" Bitcoin is facing. FFS, you've even got people talking about "brand theft." Fuck off. It's like saying someone can own the air, and brand it, and that when someone else puts a name to the air, they are thieving. You and others are carrying a serious amount of moral hazard in your overzealous support of people who have underperformed, to say the least. I'm very ambivalent at present, despite having significant financial stake in the matter. I believe that Segwit is good, I also think bigger blocks, when miners are able and willing to mine them, are good. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:11:34
And both are inapplicable anyway. But yeah, whenever someone wants to scare folks, they use "robbery," which implies physical violence, while simple theft does not require any.

I think this is the best short-term fix, and would probably have impact for many years to come in a positive way. I think storage is cheap enough, and there are options for regular users who do not want to store the entire blockchain. I think bandwidth is also cheap enough.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:42:03
Again, all of the above has nothing to do with the subject. It does more harm than good.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:22:56
What in the fuck does this have to do with the longest chain and the existential question of what is or is not Bitcoin? Do you feel you have contributed positively to the future of Bitcoin with this drama?
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:07:28
Delivery failed. That's just a weird symbol to normies. You need a website address for them to refer to for more information.

At this point this r/bitcoin should just redirect to this man's twitter feed. The implication seems to be that no one can figure out Twitter, so his every tweet should be posted and upvoted here. It's really tiresome.

It is never moral to consume more energy than you need in order to achieve a certain task.

A full 94% of the people reading these words have never even attempted to contact Roger Ver and this is the primary reason they have no understanding of the kind of person he actually is. His website has his public key published and he is responsive. Personally responsive. He is not a villian. I do not believe any of the events of the past four months would have occurred had "Core" made more significant progress in this "debate."
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:18:47
A simple block increase is also an acceptable way to keep the discussion about the way forward sane, but no one besides Gavin Andresen has rationally proposed that in the last 2+ years. So, yeah.
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:44:54
It would be cool if there was a free trial of the thing. He wants $2.99 before you can even know it works. That's unusual, usually there is an ad-supported trial or limited time trial.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:49:55
I'm not accusing Bitmain of being moral. I am weary of the semi-luddie sentiment I see around here. If it's an innovation, it should be married to the other innovation (SegWit), not mutually excluded.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:16:02
So shouldn't the fervent demand for the obsolescence of these machines be deferred until they are actually obsolete, so no one gets hurt?
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:08:39
This is a REALLY bad argument as to why asicboost is bad. "A tech you are using and selling is incompatible with tech we just released and want to get activated ASAP." Okay. Well, all you have to do is compensate all the miners for that hardware. Why in the hell should the designers have been expecting SegWit? 
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:59:34
Lame. One-sided. Funny when you want both sides of this "debate" to go away, but would be funnier with a follow-up mocking the opposition.
You are members of an ape-like race at the cocksucking end of the 21st century, smug in all-knowingness, building larger and larger barriers to a technology that was meant to break through such barriers by design. Your highs are higher than your lows. While you destroy our homes and release yourselves from the weights of reality, I'll be amazed if we survive.

@_date: 2017-04-13 03:09:40
So the strategy is gonna be to invest heavily in Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, eventually having a controlling stake, so that any time someone expresses an unacceptable opinion about Bitcoin Core, we can simply isolate that comment and troll that person to suicide. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:44:59
There's no argument that says using less energy to do the same thing is not about efficiency. I don't even need to click your link to know that. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:49:26
It's not enforced much anywhere. It's actually the only problem with the design.
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:38:25
No one has argued, to my knowledge, that the limit originally put in place was not* meant to limit spam. At the time, with all factors, huge blocks could have crippled the network. We are not in that stage anymore, and the "political football" element of his statement is referring to comments like yours.
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:56:10
Your entire post should have just been "Insert hyperbole here."
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:13:23
Yes, the dastardly clean energy cartel will stop at nothing. It's so much more profitable to change an existing, working model of energy than it is to keep it, right! And you know the oil industry, valued at nearly half a trillion globally/annually, couldn't possibly have competed with those GreenPeace dollars for scientific pay-for-play! It's a sad state of affairs, I know, but it's good to see there are still highly intelligent people like yourself denying their "findings."
@_date: 2017-04-08 08:31:05
But it's decentralized. Just make your own multi-billion dollar platform like Reddit and fork it if you don't like it, bro. /s
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:41:00
Of course it's relevant. You're just splitting hairs.

100% agree. It's written in biblical style, so both "sides" will see it as encouragement. But it's really addressed to the non-sided amongst us, and that's why I 100% agree. The charlatans on both sides are metastasizing.

It also wasn't released until long after this whole civil war was well in progress. The value of reducing congestion at the current point in history is much more than simple technological supremacy. While conditions are as they now, no clear resolutions can be had. Self-interested parties on all sides are presenting allegedly communitarian reasons for opposing their opposition, instead of finding ways to integrate the ideas of the opposition. Gavin was right. A simple increase would have given everyone breathing room to discuss the actual way forward. SegWit requires participation. A block size increase is simply giving miners the freedom to accept bigger blocks, which some would at least in times of congestion in order that they would reap those fees. SegWit is great and everything, but if it's not ready for prime time then it is not ready for prime time. The existing design gets the job done, and could simply be expanded by an amount less than the average facebook visit consumes in terms of storage. This would create a far less contentious environment for discussion. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 09:52:45
Most of your statement, which is admirable, is gutted by its preposition of identifying as a "core supporter." Allowing yourselves to be clustered into camps was the first mistake, and treating a debate that should have resolved in compromise instead as a civil war (For instance, in what world could an optional 2MB limit + segwit activation for miners not be a logical stopgap in order that a long-term solution which solved all three major camps concerns to have a neutral discussion ground without quite so much on the line? ) which must be won at all cost no matter the casualties  was your second. As a people who are known to the outside as Bitcoiners, I mean. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 08:49:31
Now you can just take a look at your own advice regarding irony. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:55:01
Do you have any advice on how you got the people interested, or did you know them beforehand? 
@_date: 2017-04-08 09:42:32
Fair enough I think.

This is not a valid reason to oppose patents. Violence is part of the natural order. It will always exist. Opposing it on idealistic grounds and moralistic panzi bullshit is no better than your standard liberal nonsensical argument. Violence has forever existed and will forever exist. That the state has a monopoly on violence is the actual problem, not that it uses violence. I do not give a fuck about your half-hearted ancap principals. You do not understand what we true black flag anarchists mean when we say we want an end to the state monopoly on violence. You believe we purport some impossible end to violence. Rather we believe in democratizing violence. This is why I am a pure anarchist, not an "anarcho capitalist," which is the truest conflict in terms. An anarchist does not believe that one system of economics should have a monopoly, either. Rather, regionally speaking, the most accepted form of economics should be dominant, and this would allow for multiple types of systems to legitimately compete. That is the closet to utopia we will ever be. 
Anyway, patents are not wrong because they are monopolies, either. They are wrong because they stifle innovation. Open source is right because it encourages innovation while still allowing people to profit from their own genius. Copyrights also allow this, so I support software copyrights and never software patents.
Thanks for getting this far into my comment before writing a reply.

When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

They should just inform the user of the size of the TX and ask how much they want to pay per kb, informing them of the current feerate average for the next block.

People sending to Bitpay and Coinbase were paying low fees, sounds like, and confusion was the rule of the day. Mr. Todd's clever little fuck-you tool probably played a role. For a payment option that was probably used so rarely, one or two bad apples would definitely have spoiled the batch.

Here we have the all-series Bitcoin maximalist. Notice it takes less than 24 hours for him to count the eggs of a million other investors. That is because none of their eggs matter! This particular maximalist does not accept that there is more than the market capitalization of Bitcoin available in terms of crypto investment, regardless of entry, and this breed of retard will miss out on countless opportunities brought forth by CRYPTOcurrency proper as they cast lots and pick sides and unfailingly protrude the attitude of "not Bitcoin = scam."

If your worldview were even remotely correct, there would only be one dominant product/service for any purpose. Digital currency? Bitcoin. Petrol currency? Dollar. Soft drink? Coca-Cola. Operating system? Windows. 
All these things retain a high network effect, and when they struggle, others do better than usual. But others continue to exist, thrive, and serve their various purposes at all times, and if any of these were to fail, the others would quickly see wider adoption. 
The fundamentally backwards, stupid notion of the Bitcoin maximalist is that we have seen even 1% of they money that will enter this market. WE HAVEN'T. Over time, money will continue to flow through it. Much will flow in through Bitcoin, at first, for the forseeable years. But if this Blocksize debate we've witnessed is a possibility in the future, just fucking forget it. Someone else will win, no matter your feelings or your singular millions, because this type of myopic idiocy is just unacceptable in regular society -- for a reason.
