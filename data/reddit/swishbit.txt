A) You roughly calculate the cost of the risk of having your bitcoins with an exchange for the period you intend to speculate. If you still think you have positive EV due to you l33t brain, go ahead. If not, do something else. Maybe produce something useful instead of playing with numbers on a screen (sorry, but true).
B) Go ahead. After the exchange you withdraw to your safe cold storage.
What is the problem really?

For 2016: I learn to develop well enough to publish several bitcoin only services and start earning some. Meanwhile price creeps up all year for a total of 5x gain. $1600 bitcoin by year-end.

You sand the coins and collect the gold dust. Just enough to not be noticable from "normal" wear, do it on tens of thousands of coins. All coins in circulation will become thinner and thinner as they get more and more fucked with by everyone and their aunts. The more I think about the problem of money, the more I understand that Bitcoin is the best solution technology thus far has brought us.

What do you mean why? If this can lead to progress in getting a substance that helps in certain cancer-scenarios developed then how can you not see "good news  for us all"?
Tha fact that noone owns a patent on it and that cheap laboratories can manufacture it freely and apply a resonably profit-margin to their sales instead on one company milking it for max profit makes it bad?

Its a clip from the movie Salò by Pasolini. It's a really sick movie and the director was murdered shortly after finishing it.

0.495 BTC raised as i write this, not a huge response but not a total failure either.

This is a first in sweden where bitcoin have been mostly ignored so far.
This will be a question in any interview he's gonna get and might make some small headlines in newspapers.
So it can go either like, "Yeah it didn't work, nobody donated" or "Response was great, this is a new way to fund political ideas and candidates"
I'm also from Sweden and have listened to Mathias in an hour-long interview for the podcast "Synfält framåt", he seems like a good guy guided by classical liberal principles without going apeshit radical.
Therefore i have donated a small amount and encourage others to do so as well.

So annoying to see endless units of Bitmine while my unit is 10 weeks late and ticking... I will never order with Bitmine again and urge anyone else considering it to re-consider. Go with another company.

One of friends wanted to gift him 0.05 BTC anonymously. But who to ask? For a secret gift, why not someone with 'secret' in his username? So they asked to do it. And here we are in the thread where he is doing it. That's what i think it means anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-13 07:29:17
Well you should also understand that Sweden has absolutely no culture of giving political donations. Like with everything else in this country, people  let the government to do it for them. It's called "partistöd"
All parties gets money  proportional to their number of supporters in the last election.
Mathias could be clearer on exactly what the money is needed for as well,  but whatever, i gave anyway 'cause giving feels goooooood :)

"The event will be resolved to "Yes" if at least one block with a size of greater than 1MB will be included in the main Bitcoin blockchain by the date of resolution"
I would also bet "no" even though I'm pretty sure the limit will be raised. The blocks probably wont suddenly swell over just because they can, rather they will slowly get bigger over time.

Sorry its not possible as they dont use a static donation adress. You need an account to donate with bitcoins and they use a coinbase checkout screen with unique adresses per donation.

Good of you to remind people of charity.
I can mention one that you didnt include:
Wikileaks. Not for everyones political taste, but anyway.
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:48:01
That skims 2.5% of the top of your investment every year. Like it's hard to hold actual Bitcoin??
But consider that Bitcoin is like Internet to laymen in '94.
Let's be helpful to 'normal' people so they don't need to turn to these fatcat middlemen.

Actually you dont need to go trough the hassle of buying an altcoin, sending it to another exchange and changing back. You can just deposit it at a gambling-sites / exchange that don't insist on sending you the same input out that you sent in(some do so be careful, do a small test first and check with a blockexplorer). So just let them sit for a few hours then max a withdrawal to a new wallet.

Why was this not your original comment instead? You are right, this is something that could be done with Steam Wallet. And you are right, they haven't done it. We don't know the reason for their not doing it or nor its effect on games though, like you would suggest. Myself and others would like to see someone implement it using the open source protocol Bitcoin. We are curious of the results.

A spirit-ruining troll comment in a thread about game-ruining troll players. How very 'meta' of you, good sir.
