true true. Was just strange :)
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:36:19
Yeah, I cant find it, and I've not seen anything about them removing them. Let me know if you can find it! I've to use blockchain for paper wallets now.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:00:16
Just getting into it, do youve a beginner pack?
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:51:26
as a recent sub to this shit makes me happy. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:18:04
Cigs are cheap there!
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:54:50
Yeah, but coinbase used to generate them and now that link's gone. I was just curious if anyone had heard anything.
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:41:45
Cool story homie.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:07:04
Thanks for the info. Yeah, I thought it was strange they just deleted the link with no announcement. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:17:39
HOORAH! Thanks for the post homie
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:18:50
Thought this was about the Klitschko's until I saw what sub it was :) Good job though!
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:15:38
All I can say is good luck to him. I hope it works out because it is complete BS. But, there's lots of shit like this happening all over the place. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:55:40
I definitely do. 3x rewards are worth it.
@_date: 2014-09-03 18:11:54
I misread nodes as nudes. I was confused.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:27:03
Full disclosure, this is my site I just launched. I will be creating a new animation at least once / week.
You can get a free animation by using code: FREEANIMATION4ME

zero to one is amazing fyi
@_date: 2012-12-07 16:03:43
Thanks everyone for the links :)

Best thing to do is NEVER GET MARRIED HOLMES!!!!!!
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:06:01
They're not honoring it. I noticed last night, and when I logged in this morning my BTC was returned, even though all the transactions are still in my history of the sell.
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:17:07
oh, they rolled 'em back. Got my email this morning --&gt; [
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:14:54
me too homie, me too. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:24:49
did yours get rolled back like mine did? --&gt; [
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:14:27
Yup, they've reversed it --&gt; [
@_date: 2015-11-14 02:23:51
Here's a better image --&gt; [
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:13:47
I just sold all my HIM yesterday!!!
@_date: 2013-02-23 04:59:44
yeah thats what I'm talking about
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:21:36
I sent my buddy some coins b/c I used to live up there. He said he'll check it out. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:33:20
Thanks for the post holmes, This is another great step towards getting Bitcoin's more accepted becoming more feasible.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:16:50
your cheerio made me smile and happy - thanks for that. Also GO GOONERS!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:04:07
Check the edit my friend :)
@_date: 2013-08-11 20:34:53
I agree with you as far as the break even point, &amp; the accuracy of their assessments. But I feel as though they're the first player to try to address the bottleneck in BTC as I see it, especially because there will be absolutely more regulations in the near future as it gains even more traction.
Thanks for bringing some valuable points to the thread.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:00:04
Fair enough - Thanks.
@_date: 2013-01-19 19:59:46
Yeah thats one of the aspects from their site that I dont quite like. I've some investments on the site, just to get a better understanding of how they work. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:21:09
fk yo couch son
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:10:09
'd you sell your d3 gold on that site?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:56:39
Dividends ( in this particular case ) are in BTC. You've a wallet with them and they just toss the dividend payouts to your address, and you can transfer them around wherever you'd like.
@_date: 2013-08-11 15:49:25
I would love it. Win 8. Link it to Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-02-14 18:26:51
Thanks my friend :)
@_date: 2013-02-22 14:02:40
I would appreciate it, as the Win 8 App marketplace isn't too full of BTC anything yet. I keep checking every week, and dont have the time / passion to develop one!
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:12:25
Have you read the actual [Business Plan]( or just the Prospectus?
@_date: 2013-04-30 15:41:17
s'pose so holmes :) Thats what initially sparked my interest though!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:10:59
touche homie :)

Gratitude - Worker name is franklinTurtle
@_date: 2013-03-12 12:29:11
I'd have to agree with you. I tried to purchase, but Coinbase had reached their limit already ... kind of a pain
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:57:14
any speculation as to why? Suppose just to 'create' monies.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:13:31
you get paid based on how many shares you own - Investing 101 holmes :)
@_date: 2013-01-29 18:01:13
I've had no issues with them - Did you ask them what seems to be the problem? Anytime I've contacted them they're prompt and resolve the issue in a timely manner.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:22:12
Thanks holmes. I know us Windows Phone users are a minority, but is all good.
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:02:39
Thanks homie :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:02:30
trough tought?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:19:56
Thanks for the post holmes, I just got their email and noticed they accept Bitcoins now too! Was going to post but you beat me to it!!
@_date: 2013-09-23 18:01:13
Nice to see Coinbase integration. Lets see how this lil bastard does, I've been waiting ... :) you the dev?
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:07:18
are they able to be ordered yet? They're a bit small and seem like they'd be easily snagged though. 
@_date: 2013-01-29 17:52:47
Careful saying that - the ol' McD might come knocking! haha.
Awesome work though, and thanks for helping the BTC economy :) Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:57:28
yeah, that makes sense. Just strange to me I suppose. Why would anyone be using Mt. Gox at the moment, when BTC-E is almost half the price. I guess people just stick to what they're familiar with and have already setup?
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:40:15
if I had some BTC's left I'd tip you my friend. Greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:02:47
haha thanks for that.
@_date: 2013-07-11 18:41:20
Really, nobody has anything to say about this?
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:20:03
yeah ...
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:44:35
ick. 
@_date: 2013-01-19 19:57:10
Appreciate all of the information king. I think it would be in my best interest to just pay someone to do all of this. Would you be interested in helping at all?
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:29:16
ah, thats it - Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:02:04
How's it different though? Or is it basically the same concept just cheaper atm. ?
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:07:02


@_date: 2013-04-16 16:15:22
What're you looking for help with?
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:55:21
really .... 
@_date: 2013-08-11 20:38:08
Thats exactly why I was shocked that nobody was really discussing it much here! I absolutely read through them both, as I wanted to see how you guys were approaching the major issue with BTC's viability and ability to be widespread with the current and upcoming regulations.
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:24:46
Guessing its OP's Cellphone? Nokia lumia 920 possibly? 
@_date: 2013-01-29 18:19:44
I can understand that holmes. I do dislike the whole waiting ~ one week deal!
@_date: 2013-01-16 20:26:37
Could someone explain to me how these things work? The FAQ's dont really help me - It would be greatly appreciated, because I'm getting sick of playing poker for BTC's
@_date: 2013-01-19 20:09:50
Hey btcthinker,
I think that it would be a good way for people to get used to using and interacting with Bitcoins as its growing, in a familiar platform ( ie. a banks loan ).
I'm funding it out of my own pocket at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:56:28
Sorry, but you really put Swag in your username ... no bueno.
@_date: 2013-10-14 23:21:19
that picture in teh article is creepy.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:04:15
Check the edit homie :)
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:02:46
Touche, thanks homie
@_date: 2013-08-11 20:04:00
Touche homie, didnt even think of that. the URL's are from Havelock's site, but I suppose I could be one of those guys. 
I'm just trying to get the word out, &amp; I feel as though this is exactly what will propel crypto's, especially BTC, into the next league.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:12:54
I read that as 'U.S. citizens' not 'us citizens' - made it all that much better! 
I dont care what language(s) you speak, I was just genuinely confused :) Either way, I agree with you, great article
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:06:55
I MISS ROCHESTER!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:03:32
Why do you or any of us care - honestly?
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:43:27
ALL DAY BABY
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:29:17
Thanks for the info my friend. I was just curious as I've lent out a few BTC's to test the waters, but I just dont see where I've had an increase in the balance from any profits. Maybe it takes some time?
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:28:38
I agree with you. Mac's like playschool toys for adults who want to use computers. Enjoy the overpriced repair bill :)
@_date: 2013-01-29 18:04:15
Not an app per se, but this site runs fine in my browser on my cell: [
Its video poker though
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:17:20
Goofy ass mo fuka in that picture! Glad they accept my BTC's though
@_date: 2013-06-03 15:25:08
Could do this with Bitspend months ago. 
To be fair, I didnt watch the video, and I use Bitspend a lot :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:48:21
You never closed your 'disclosure' holmes :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:59:50
Thanks for the info holmes :)
@_date: 2013-01-18 18:37:40
Hey hazekBTC,
Yes, I've heard of them. I've had the idea floating around in my head for a bit, and after checking them out have found things I would do differently, and I think better than they do.
Thank you for the input though.
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:32:22
I've a few addresses I'm willing to donate for storage :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:32:09
Thanks, thats the kind of information I was looking for. I already know the obvious bits! Maybe that was obvious to other people though :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:37:43
Sorry, Apple sucks homie. They've fantastic marketers / designers though. 
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:23:24
Have you read any of their documentation or are you just basing your response on gragnak's?
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:38:44
Stop whining, and keep on losing out homie.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:21:28
IM RICHHHHHHH BBBBBITTTTTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:03:38
Yeah I actually just found them while searching around. I want it more of a P2P deal, kind of how if you wanted to send your friend coins. Along those lines. Thanks for the link though :)
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:20:58
best comment on thread. made me laugh my ass off.
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:14:27
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:25:35
Not sure yet, I'm just diving into it - Sorry!
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:20:51


Where in any of their documentation do they say they'll be trading?
From their documents:


They're just the middleman, who will deal with all the regulations and 'fun' that the Exchanges seem to have a lacking in. Therefore, allowing the Exchanges to have known compliant customers to interact with, and also decreasing the time it takes to exchange fiat to crypto.
@_date: 2013-03-12 13:44:50
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:49:10
Thats what I like to hear. I didnt purchase them to 'create money outta nothing.' I purchased mine to contribute to the network, not an investment. 
There are major players, and mining companies who've invested many times more than I will for the sake of profit. My contribution is for stability.
@_date: 2013-07-22 19:43:22
Yes, tons.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:04:30
Yous funny :)
