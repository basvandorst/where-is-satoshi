Someone let their nephew in high school who "knows coding" make the website. Hey, I mean they built it free, right?

Panama you mean? Panama papers? Couldn't tell if you were making a joke about avoiding taxes being Paradise or it's a typo. Pay your taxes kids. Sure go for those tax breaks where you can, but don't evade taxes. Prison isn't as fun as it sounds.
Edit: I Get it. I need to follow WIKILeaks more closely I guess. Also, some of you are a little hardcore about tax evasion. I have kids, I'm not intentionally breaking laws.

The fuck? You jump straight to politics?

Oh so you're just posting off topic then? Okay so downvoting you shouldn't be a problem since politics and weather aren't related to anything we're talking about.

Snowflake is a term used by the alt-right (read The_Donald and certain Fox news correspondents) to describe whiny liberals/Democrats. The term implied that the person. They are talking to thinks they're special or unique. It's also used to insult millennials. I don't really see why they used it here except maybe to troll.

Forgive me if I'm incorrect, but didn't the initial bitcoin Boom come as a result of Corsica or Crete or some shitty Mediterranean island's banks shutting down and all the Russian mob and politicians moved their money into bitcoin there? Think it was like February 2012. 
Edit: mobile autocorrect. Apparently bitcoin isn't a word.

Okay. Well, guess I'm done then. Thanks man.
