He obviously hasn't thought his conspiracy theory through.  *dons tinfoil hat*. He is right because all the money being lent on finex is by finex management alone!

Haha - You were going to give them $119.  Glad we fixed that for you :)  Take your special lady out for a decent dinner and don't look back.  The people that buy into those kind of subscription advice blogs are often looking for some reassurance of their own trading positions or need somebody else to tell them how to lose money.  When they finally realize how much money they've wasted, they're too ashamed to admit to others of what they did.
Don't get lazy.  Listen to everyone, but do your own research.

Adding to that, finex's ToS referred to in the webcache mentioned that I had one of the keys to my bitgo address, which is not true.  I believe I recall Zane saying that 2 keys were kept by finex, one cold, one hot, and one with BitGo.  The confusion never ends!

Jealous.  They still haven't uttered another peep and my BitGo balance remains untouched.  Far as BFX tokens go, if you really need that 34% of your owed funds right now, you know what to do.  If not, its close enough to zero with a greater upside if they don't completely flop to just hang on to them for the time being.  Seems most are going that route if they haven't already instadumped the second they got access to their accounts. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:07:44
The trend in crypto lately has been, the scammier looking the coin, the more profit.  Buy all the BFX coin you can when it goes live, it will 10x.

So, some users are getting more information than others.  Fantastic.  And are you essentially confirming that transcript is true, when you said it wasnt?
Edit: Referring to the "haircut" and BFXcoin transcript of giancarlco
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:26:18
If the coins were sent after the hack, but before the site was shut down, he did not get the haircut.  I can confirm my coins in such a situation were returned to me in full.  He's grumbling about the exchange price fluctuating and him not being able to have access to his coin.  But like he said 'this is small compared to other losses'.  He dodged a bullet, and is crying because he scratched his knee instead of getting killed.
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:59:15
They've asked me for more verification information than an actual bank would.  Seriously, asking me what I'm doing with MY money? Who am I sending it to?  To me, this is akin to having the ATM machine asking what you're doing with the cash before you are allowed to remove it from the machine.  AML/KYC overload bros, and coinbase lost a customer because of it.

Because bad trading is always somebody else's fault.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:47:29
I think what he wanted was for you to have one place, and one place alone, where you update information.  Right now, I have to refresh your user page, check the bitfinex status page (which at the time of this writing is not as updated as the blog), check the blog, and comb through numerous threads dealing with this issue.  No official emails from bitfinex whatsoever!  Can you not see where the frustration is coming from?  Couple that with vague responses and promises of tomorrow, and we have the 'two weeks' situation all over again.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:10:44
I completely agree with you here.  By finex stating they are closing all margin positions at those prices, it seems they are stating that ALL bitcoins used in margin positions have been stolen, or that pieces of stolen bitcoins comprise your margin position.  Therefore, the individualized account defense is invalid.  Very, very messy but I think they think they see this is as the first step to accounting.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:05:47

Seriously, it seems coinbase has been in trouble for some time now.  Fee structure changes, adding ethereum (LOL), blood and stool sample requirements for verification...
Well, it makes sense that they'd want to give priority to the loudest mouth complainers (redditors).  This is still very shitty practice though; all customers should receive the same priority in support issues.  If this whole fiasco is true, I'm glad I ditched coinbase a year or so back because they just weren't cheaper than Circle.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:31:39
Damn, they're going to make me break out my conspiracy theory hat again on them giving us the runaround while they try and secure more funds to cover the impending withdrawal wave v2.  I still have bitcoins in my BitGo account as of writing this.  Funny thing is, I shouldn't have a single coin in there at all in the first place.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:39:28
He is the only source of information coming out of finex.  He is maintaining the status page (kind of), the blog, and monitoring reddit by picking and choosing what he wants to answer, as vaguely as possible.  He is as far as anybody can tell, the official word of BitFinex.
We have good reason to be getting frustrated with him at this point.  
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:52:22
You can do what the owners of Finex are probably doing.  Create a new account, do not verify it, buy bitcoins elsewhere (Circle, Coinbase (avoid)), transfer it in to your new, unverified account, click Not US and Not NY (even if your IP is NY).
Margin trading available, buying BFX tokens available.

Yup the PDF was the one I sent in.  I also had a txt file with the XPRV key, thats the one I sent after they invalidated my PDF (not scanned, original from BitGo).  I dont remember if the txt file I had was one I generated myself, or downloaded alongside the PDF but I had them stored in the same location.
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:28:08
In my case, the deposit was literally 30 seconds before the site went down.  The rest of my coins got the haircut.  Honestly, I figured they were all gone at that point (goxxed) so to get them back was nice ($thousands).
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:29:57
I had heard from others on reddit (ironclad proof) that if you had USD in your Exchange account (not Margin Trading or Margin Funding), SynapsePay would automatically wire you back the money you had housed in that exchange account (USD), all without you requesting from finex or SynapsePay to do so. 
I was wondering though, how they were going to handle the haircut for customers like this in which the exchange balance was wired back, but other balances remained in the account.  I assumed they would classify the returned wired SynapsePay as balances that also deserved a haircut (as everybody else that wasnt SP got rekt) and take that 36% from your other balances - then release the remainder of your funds for wallet transfer or withdrawal.  If you didnt have enough to cover that 36%, then perhaps this is where the problem lies, and you'll never see that money back.
Could you please clarify for the benefit of all finex customers?
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:43:12
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:44:22
:) This is perfect.  There seems to be a very polarized view of finex on reddit these days; either you hate them and think they are a total BS fraud scam exchange that robbed itself, or you love them because you have a huge stake in BFX coin going to $1 so you can GTFO (and you still think finex is a total BS fraud scam exchange that robbed itself)
@_date: 2016-08-16 00:33:02
Well pops, you're ahead of me in the queue at this point.  They still haven't touched my BitGo balance at all.  So no matter how upset you feel, just remember, there is some poor SOB out there in a worse situation than you :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:40:31
Can anyone corroborate this claim that he could withdraw USD directly, without going through the finex platform?  If so, thats going to make an already messy situation downright filthy.

Zane - Honestly, I've been following your ass around and busting your balls left and right.  I can tell you are working hard.  But there are so many inconsistencies (you've just admitted to one there) and irregularities with your statements and suggestions, its very, very alarming.  I'd suggest you place a gag order on yourself until you have CONCRETE evidence to tell us all.  One bitcoin bro to another.  If your handlers complain, show them this post.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:27:03
I signed up, and I can do no such freezing of funds.  I cant even see my wallet with the coins there.  I can only track it via my deposit addresses.  Under my audit log, I can see I've authorized bitfinex to create wallets on my behalf, and I get emails from bitgo referencing my customer ID number of some sort with coins moving.  Thats it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:27:45
Seems like they will create some sqlUSD and sqlBTC and settle the positions, then deal with the aftermath of who got boned the hardest.  I highly doubt they will be able to match 1:1 longs and shorts in all positions.  They are going to take my profitable positions, close them at my disadvantage, and pocket the difference or put that in a fund to repay the unlucky folks that finex alone has the discretion of applying the blame to.  How are they going to account for who is holding bitcoin in margin positions and lending?  There isnt a clear or equitable solution to this, but it seems most are going to feel the pain, and some are going to get outright murdered.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:46:34
The "hacker" got access to BFX private keys securing your bitcoin, and you wonder if they got your email?!?!?

You need exchanges and coins on exchanges in order to develop a market value for these speculative instruments.
Not all people just sat there with bitcoins chilling doing nothing.  I personally sent a chunk of coin there to SELL, then WITHDRAW.  Do you seriously expect everyone to use localbitcoins or some other crap like that?
When will YOU take this seriously?  You can step down off that pedestal now.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:49:18
What is a "bunch"?  Please, do not ignore the fact that nearly the entirety of the "market value" of bitcoin is due to speculative, active, trading.  This is NOT possible without having a presence on exchanges.  There are real costs associated with getting your money on and off an exchange.  
If people are using exchanges as wallets, then well, I would agree that is not wise or best practice.
@_date: 2016-08-26 02:20:35
Yea, resolving my BitGo account lock was a nightmare.  Their support must have been swamped, but the level of "support" I actually got was definitely subpar.

American, non-SynapsePay, here.  My account was locked due to BitGo in a similar manner as the OP is describing.  No wallet transfers or withdrawals.  Once finex was able to sweep my BitGo account of the bitcoins housed there, my account was unlocked within the hour.  I'm guessing the OP's problem is something to do with finex having to manually go through accounts like his to recalculate the haircut as fairly as possible.

How about this, finex emails you this when you confirm you are not a US resident.  Note the part about not being able to even withdraw these tokens, LOL.
US Residents
This email is to confirm that you have indicated you are not a US Resident. This check was important because certain platform functionality (including trading, depositing, and withdrawing the BFX token) is currently restricted for US Customers.

From what I've heard, coinbase was "leaking" ETC with ETH withdrawals.  BTC-e also had this problem and flat out called ETC a scam (rightfully so).  
What happened to these exchanges is that when a user made a withdrawal of forked ETH, they also were receiving pre-fork ETH(ETC).  If they transferred ETH back to coinbase or BTC-e, and withdrew again, they'd be receiving different ETH than they took out the last time (and thus also receive ETC, again).
So in all likelihood, coinbase just doesnt have these ETC at all, and are having to buy them on the open market to make customers like you whole, and thus the delay.
Still, shame on coinbase for being so damn scammy.
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:30:54
Seems hes ESL, so I'm thinking he got confused reading whatever email hes talking about from Circle.  Having been a user of Circle for some time now (year+?), I can fully attest that it is not a scam.

More time = greater percentage of customers wanting to withdraw everything and not returning.
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:14:38
Got the BitGo message and cant withdraw/transfer wallets.  Pretty sure its due to SynapsePay sending USD directly back to finex customers (who then didn't get the haircut on the USD).  They're probably going to recalculate these balances with 0 USD and then chop your crypto holdings further.  I'm guessing they went a little overboard and halted more accounts with BitGo too just to be on the safe side.  I was not signed up with synapsepay but I was with BitGo.  Just a semi-wild guess here.

Any updates, dad?  I sent over my recovery key to finex and they said, 
'We will unfreeze your BitGo and Bitfinex account as soon as we can. Unfortunately, this is a manual process and it will require some time before we can process all affected accounts.'
Just about two days ago at this point since I got that message.  Account still locked.

All of this speculation and asking Zane about specific scenarios is really not needed and makes my eyes hurt.  He doesn't know, and he will tell us all when he is able.  Got it?
I have(had) bitcoin, litecoin, USD, and other digital tokens in more than one account on finex; margin positions open (profitable ones that are likely to be closed prematurely), assets lent out, and normal limit orders all over the books.  Needless to say, the situation is very complicated not just for me and I think we are all going to be taking it in the rear barring some miracle, even though it appears my BitGo funds are still there.  
should be granted sainthood for this kind of dedication and dealing with constant internet feces being flung his direction.  I just hope he isn't being deceived by his handlers.
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:13:51
Got a response saying the PDF that BitGo sent me was the wrong one (what???) and they wanted me to send the text version in.  Luckily, I had that one too.  The finex site wont even let you upload a txt file.  Anyway, support says they have the correct key, but account is still locked.  Looks like I'll have access Soon^TM.

I think you'll find the "effective" haircut changes greatly.
@_date: 2016-09-01 19:24:13
I understand you're upset by not making a huge profit when you believe you should have, but I'm going to side with finex on this one.  If they went about closing portions of your margin long position without your consent, regardless if it was profitable or not, I think we'd have bigger issues.  They obviously had to do this for the "hack" and haircut to take place to settle balances, but this is a different situation.
@_date: 2016-09-01 19:59:45
LOL If there were an olympic category for an exchange being shady as fk, finex would be Phelps.  I trust anonymous Russian mafia gangsters over at BTC-e and the volume faking chinamen at OKHuobi more than these Italian crooks running finex.  Once you get past that, make the money, and gtfo :)
@_date: 2016-09-01 19:51:15
Another guy has mentioned it, and I let Zane know as well as they are messing up a bit here with the orders that are outstanding in the books.  I had exchange orders in the books to sell BFX, but my exchange balance of BFX was reduced, while my orders sat in the books untouched.  If they executed, it would leave me with a negative balance of BFX.  I'm not sure if the system would catch it there or not, but the balances in the sell side of the books are likely not accurate.
@_date: 2016-09-07 19:02:11

@_date: 2016-09-01 19:19:08
Well, at the opening of margin trading, BFX was around 40 cents and then jumped to 50 cents shortly thereafter.  After the redemption was announced, we saw almost 58 cents after being paused at the psychological barrier of 50 cents.  
But yea, there is ALWAYS somebody with information that will frontrun the markets.  Even legitimate markets that are "regulated".
@_date: 2016-09-01 20:18:04

@_date: 2016-09-02 18:16:33
I figured you'd need some kind of protection like that.  But it still inflated the sell side of the books with BFX that didnt exist.  Make sure you guys address this kind of issue in the future; it doesnt bode well for confidence in the management or development team to see errors like this slip through the cracks.
@_date: 2016-09-11 04:08:02

Zane, not sure how you folks want to handle this, but I had orders in the books to sell BFX tokens.  After this redemption, my orders are still there.  If the orders executed, I'd have a negative BFX balance.  Just a heads up so you can clean things up.
Edit: I fixed it myself, but you should probably also lower outstanding orders by the same ratio as you redeemed in order to keep the books accurate.

What I'm getting from the fragmented information, is that he is being accused of having multiple accounts (perhaps trading via altcoins and attempting to withdraw bitcoins), accessing the accounts via Tor,  the origins of the initial coins are of a dubious nature, and hes trying to obfuscate this using your service (this part I'm not sure, but my mind is running wild with drugs, cryptolocker/ransomware, or blacklisted coins from old hacks).
If this isnt the case, well, you can see how being unclear on both sides doesnt help the general public.

I'm still interested in the whole story.  Spill as many of the beans as you can.  He's claiming you guys are unlawfully keeping his money.  There was a recent police shooting in Los Angeles, and to calm people down (against protocol), they released security footage of the guy that got shot brandishing a handgun while hiding and fleeing from the police.

If you aren't giving us the whole story, I'm going to bitchslap you via the internet.  If you're telling the truth, then finex should release your funds and you should go elsewhere for your anonymous business.
