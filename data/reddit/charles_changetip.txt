Can you take a screenshot of what you see? This sounds like a very unique bug. Let's see if we can get this working for you!
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:51:34
You are correct. You cannot tip from inside comments just yet, but it is something I think we are all excited to see one day!
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:30:42
Tipping on Facebook is quite different from tipping on other platforms, but we achieved it! You can tip from the ChangeTip homepage and from within the app's page on Facebook!

Sorry to hear you are having trouble with the site. It's getting a lot of attention right now! If the site has worked for you in the past, and you are only running into trouble now, then I am sure it will work very soon.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:03:16
Great idea! I'll pass it along.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:58:55
Ok, I'll pass that along. At least you were able to get it working on Chrome.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:57:52
Ok. Sorry I couldn't help you more!
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:46:33
Not yet, but maybe soon!
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:11:37
Ok, third time is the charm! Try opening a fresh browser window, log out of Facebook and then back in. Then, in that same fresh browser window, try refreshing your Facebook to ChangeTip account connection in your ChangeTip settings page. Try tipping then. Does it work?
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:03:25
There is no syntax required. Tipping on Facebook is much different than tipping on other platforms. You can only tip friends, and only from directly within the Facebook ChangeTip app or from your main page on the ChangeTip site.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:07:12
Tipping in comments is not yet supported, but I think we all look forward to to the day when it will be!
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:14:26
Yeah, that's what I mean. Unfortunately you can't tip from within comment threads just yet.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:37:15
Thank you. I'll let you and everyone know when we've cleared this up.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:28:11
Try refreshing the connection between your Facebook and ChangeTip accounts by clicking "refresh" next to Facebook on your account settings page. Log out of Facebook and then log back in. Does it work now?
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:47:27
Did you remember to connect your Facebook and ChangeTip accounts at  or is it looking like a bug?
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:03:46
Everything should be working now. Let me know if it does!
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:40:30
Hey there! Did you connect your Facebook and ChangeTip accounts at  before attempting to send the tip? Let me know if you have or haven't, and I'll try to get this working for you.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:59:25
Hey, we've pushed a change that should fix the problem you had with Facebook. Let me know if it works for you now. :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:41:10
First connect your Facebook account to ChangeTip here: 
After you've connected your account you should then be able to tip via the direct tipper at the top of your profile page. The button to select Facebook tipping is in between the Twitter and the One Time Tip buttons. From then on it's a matter of selecting who you would like to tip and then the amount. Click "Preview Tip" and then approve the posting to send your tip!
Let me know if this works for you.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:12:16
Did you clear your cache too? It looks like we'll have a harder and broader fix soon, but that will probably help in the meantime.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:26:31
Can you try clicking the "refresh" button to refresh the connection between your Facebook and ChangeTip accounts on your settings page, as well as logging out and back into Facebook? That should do it. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:32:29
Hey We put in a solution that should have fixed everything. Get back to me if it works or doesn't work now!
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:44:49
It is possible, but not all at once. You will have to tip them one by one.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:35:39
You're welcome! 
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:42:03
A few people have been running into this. Let me pass your feedback along so this can be better addressed. Did you remember to connect your Facebook and ChangeTip accounts at  prior?
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:18:25
PM'd you. Dollar sign comes before the number instead of after. Type $2 instead of 2 $
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:39:17
That's perfectly fine when you intend to tip the YouTube channel. I am referring to tipping within comments, which is what I originally assumed he was trying to do.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:25:22
The syntax is always +Receiver $1 +ChangeTip
The most important part is waiting for both "+Receiver" and "+ChangeTip" to pop-up and highlight after you have entered them.

PM me your bitcoin wallet address and I'll refund your money to it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:13:50
I think I found your problem. Your tip was in this format:
AdamKokeshSpread some more Freedom for me +AdamKokesh 2 $ +ChangeTip ﻿
This is the incorrect format. Dollars are always expressed with the dollar sign before the number: $2 and not 2$
Try this instead:
AdamKokeshSpread some more Freedom for me +AdamKokesh $2 +ChangeTip ﻿
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:41:01
If you're ever interested in trying again, then send me a PM and we'll work it out.
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:23:39
It looks like you haven't connected your YouTube account to your ChangeTip account yet. That's probably why the tips aren't going through.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:06:35
But not reddit? It appears that you are saying you have two ChangeTip accounts instead of one with all the accounts linked. Did you deposit into the right account?
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:28:48
Google has made all of our lives difficult, but we'll get this working for you I promise ;)
