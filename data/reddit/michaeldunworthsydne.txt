Of course they're aware of this. The SEC or CFTC whoever is in charge requires a ton of regulatory work to be done surrounding this. That's why none of the US based exchanges offer leveraged instruments or futures.

Well your quote made the top comment at least, so you're on your way :) 
To be fair, considering what him and his team are doing for the community by encouraging/driving/nurturing so many bitcoin startups (more than anyone else in the space, by far) your comment seems a bit [hater]( for little reason other than envy.

Six months ago, Anthony Watson, the young hotshot CIO of Nike, abruptly left the sports apparel giant for personal reasons. In April, Fortune reported where he had landed: Bitreserve, a cloud money service that uses bitcoin. And now, not quite three months into his time there, he has a new title: CEO.
That was fast.

@_date: 2015-06-13 14:10:35
Not really, the same can be applied for a method like PayPal.
They run the jobs through the platform to build ratings/portfolio/credibility/trust.
It's not as common as you would think for people to do one job then just do all future jobs with that employer off platform.

But the thing is with all this, consumers don't demand it, but if you tabled it as a potential value prop to them, they'd understand.
"Wouldn't it be amazing if you could have a phone that had no buttons and it just knew wherever you touched on the screen instead of having a clunky keyboard" 
People would more than likely have reacted with "Oh that's so awesome!!!! I'd love that!!!!"
But tabling the value prop of bitcoin is a little different. "This is a currency that you can send anywhere in the world, for free pretty much! But spending it is a big hassle as limited places accept it and you're susceptible to larger than normal currency price swings"
I'm a huge fan of bitcoin, but in the context of what they're doing, Imho I don't think it sells well to consumers that are trying to send USD to their parents to pay their electricity bills in GBP over in the UK (just an example)

Hey, totally valid questions. Let me answer them for you


Snapcard is a long term venture, of course. The blockchain is here to stay :)


We've been operational since November 2013 and processed millions of dollars for our merchants all over the world since then. Our company does merchant processing &amp; wallet solutions. For us to be able to pay out our merchants worldwide, we needed to work out solutions to make it fast and cost effective (we don't charge our merchants on settlement). So we built out a system and used it internally for these disbursements. 
As we saw it working well for us, we felt that branding it and opening it up to the public would be awesome to let them leverage the blockchain as [we have]( 
So we've already been doing it for ourselves and not generating revenue on it because our core business has been merchant solutions + wallet services.
Sorry for the long response, just wanted to clarify what's going on behind the scenes here :) 
Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:53:48

@_date: 2014-05-22 19:19:46
Well it's more efficient doing phone orders because a lot of the ordering forms online disable after you order 1 or 2 and make you wait 15 minutes, so we're like a pizza call center right now. "Hello, how may I take your order"
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:45:06

I'm surprised that they don't take 30% of the "purchases" revenue made (e.g. taking 30% of the 1% that coinbase charges for when you buy/sell Bitcoin). Not sure if they'd permit that or not, possibly.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:17:51
I agree with everything you've said, but I think crediting a company that doesn't exist yet as approving the notion doesn't seem very rational.

It shouldn't be incentivised on a platform level, otherwise you get answers that are just thrown out there in a hope to have some relevance and get some split of the bounty. Integrate some form of tip bot would be a better option imo. This would keep everything the same and people only pay if they want to. Probably will work out just as beneficial and will maintain a higher level of integrity in the responses.
@_date: 2014-11-25 21:30:31
That's not really relevant. We're talking about now, moving forward, I could never have friends with a siginificant amount of bitcoin not get verified with their ID, and if they did manage to avoid it (via localbitcoins or something) then the process is too convoluted for the user of today (comparatively) - My whole life revolves around bitcoin, I'm just trying to be realistic. Not saying it won't change moving forward of course :)

It's designed as a placeholder for the merchant to be able to get paid out in digital currencies. Not all merchants had multiple wallets (different currencies) so it was problematic when they had to provide there own addresses. So this is a placeholder. You can forward on to your personal wallet whenever you like.

Well to be honest, I took a taxi ($25) from our hotel to "The D" just to use it to support the economy and participate etc... Also bought a souvenir from the gift shop next to it (paid in BTC) just to essentially be a customer so they see use etc...
Turns out that there was a Bitcoin ATM next door to my hotel (I was at Planet Hollywood and there's a Bitcoin ATM in a shop up the road next to the Chili's restaurant). Either way, not the ideal experience, but still good being part of it all :)

There are 10 pairs of limited edition Michael Jordans.
I own 1 pair of them. Assume a new pair comes out each day.
If I know that my 1/10 will now become 1/11, what happens to the value of my holding?
So what I would do then is trade/spend/use them to ensure I get maximum value, before the value decreases the next day when they become 1/11.
Hoarding money, and investing money are literally the opposite of each other. When you invest your money, that money (in one way or another) is injected into circulation and into the economy. Hoarding it, is sticking it under your bed.
Hoarding Money = Sitting it under your bed, never touching it. 
Investing Money = Giving it to somebody else to spend in exchange for an ROI (be it guarantee'd or not)
I'm not trying to be argumentative or anything, I'm genuinely curious if I'm wrong and I'm open to learning more (seriously).
Thanks dude!

To be fair... What sort of info do you need to provide any company when buying bitcoin (Circle/Coinbase/Bitstamp/Etc...). Still have to provide a whole bunch, just looks a lot longer on that document. I agree though, sending you don't need to worry about any of it.

I think this was well said. Bitcoin as a deposit method is what you need, instead of them splashing it everywhere. It's got to earn the "splash everywhere" status for companies to do that. So the more they see donations flood in, the more priority it will get as a payment method (positioning).

I work at snapCard and I can assure you that leaving them a voicemail will do nothing. We have a significantly high volume with them and have issues and nothing gets resolved in under 7 days. You're going to really need to grind this one out unfortunately.
Edit: This issue is with TigerDirect though. What would happen is TigerDirect would get an email from BitPay (assuming you paid and the timer then ran out or something to that effect) saying "Late Payment Notice". This then requires them to contact BitPay and confirm the transaction should go through or be applied to their billing account. Try speaking to TigerDirect and telling them this, although I'm not quite sure what processes they have in place. Hope this is of some help.

Banks choose how "efficient" they are. They could make transfers instant if they wanted, they could also make it free to transfer, but they don't because they have no competition. 
Bitcoin has a really great opportunity to set some new standards and hopefully force banks to stay competitive and get out of their comfort zone. I think it's all good things regardless, a little bit of disruption to an old industry is exciting for all parties involved :)

This was really cringe-worthy. I'm an avid bitcoin fan and have a career dedicated to it, but dignifying them with criticism seems silly, just prove them wrong and let the product speak for itself. 
This is a marathon, not a sprint. Concentration of everyone's energy can be much better spent avoiding the path to criticise people that don't understand (or do understand but choose to avoid). 
Make educational videos and constructive content toward non adopters. Mastercard is a far superior option for spending right now. Cashback offerings, stores that accept it, etc... It's not about now though, it's about moving forward, so don't bother fighting all these little battles. 
The product will speak for itself, instead of us speaking for it. I assume that I'll get downvoted into oblivion for this opinion.
fyi - Mastercard guy is from New Zealand, Crocodile Dundee is from Australia.

Australia is always very laid back with a lot of things. Right now, nobody cares/no action being taken (funds frozen/bank accounts closed/etc...)
Our version of coinbase is called coinjar.com
I have used both a lot, they're both basically the same thing. Just setup for different markets.
Little amount of merchant integration around. I've founded a bitcoin company (snapCard) in America and bending over backwards to get my visa so I can be there, when in reality it makes 100x more sense to be established in Australia for regulation purposes.
Either way, I think Australia from both a regulatory standpoint and a user adoption perspective, will have a lot to offer emerging BTC companies over this period of hypergrowth.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:38:47
No it won't. It makes sense now what they're aiming at, but taking actions like this just shows the business immaturity of the industry. Pushing yourselves away from one of the most influential companies in an industry without letting them have the first word is ridiculous. Not to mention, including a CEO of a company with no product, no users, no market contribution as someone who also believes that notion. It's embarrassing. This is a poor move, out of pure paranoia. It shows the insecurities in their own companies/industry that they were so dependant on such an heavy market presence from one company. (FYI - I've never used Gox, and I don't like Gox)
Edit: I prefer every single company to Gox, I just don't think this is a good choice by all of them taking action this way.

I disagree. 
Inflation is used, and adjusted based on economic activity. I'm not saying there are any good working examples of it, but to think inflation is not a good thing is a little naive imo. Inflation forces people to spend, use, and transact. Which (for a currency) is exactly what you want. Otherwise you get people hoarding it.

Declaring a company "insolvent"? They've not made any statements about insolvency as yet. While it looks that way, and probably is, it's not their place to label it that way until Mt. Gox is insolvent or at least makes a statement/press release/email blast. It's not the right of a group of competing companies to gang up on one company and declare it insolvent.

Dogecoin is incredibly applicable to steam though, given the low average product price, demographic, "fun" is directly associated with gaming too.

When big banks/funds start coming into Bitcoin, there's going to be no rules. For huge funds, it's like a license to insider trade essentially. That's when the rollercoaster will really start. Totally agree with what you've said. Heavy concentration of positions is a scary thought in a market with no rules.

Dogecoin is a great way for people to onboard into crypto and learn about it in a much less intimidating manner.

It's not a "marker" - It's a cruddy marketing campaign from a company called "BTCSmart" which engages in what appears to be the most ponzi-esque scheme ever.

Well it says for adding usd verify your ID using Facebook. From my experience, and your comments in this thread, it's obviously not a tool for ID verification, it's a "convenience" factor. It's just not the right wording, hence why this was posted on this subreddit because it's quite strange. Not sure if any of this helps or not, trying to though :)

there's not one single successful product in the world, on earth, ever, in history that did not/will not have a competitor. Not saying this is competition, but there is literally nothing for you to complain about. If you want bitcoins to be used everywhere, this will help that. If you're sitting on a giant pile of them hoping to get rich, this will help that too. I'm not a fan of altcoins as they're mainly pump and dumps. Some serve a very good purpose though. Dogecoin is outstanding at creating awareness for thousands of people. Bringing them into Digital Currencies is the first step that everyone should be wanting people to agree on. Where they go from there, is a choice they make. That's my thoughts and considering that Bitcoin is basically a "product" that is marketable just like a new invention like a car, you want people creating competition because it attracts industry awareness. I'm speaking about Dogecoin mainly here, not the pump and dumps, I agree with you about most alts being dog poop. Just my opinion though.

I'm assuming that we're talking about developed nations (e.g USA) so this would be different for different countries.
Things they can understand resonate. Speed. It's as fast as sending an email, instead of sending money via bank transfer/ach/wire. Cheap, it costs $0.2c to do a transfer and it's instant. 
Who knows, but the incentives to use it aren't really there for the average (American) Joe. You'll only start getting incentives to use it over traditional cash when merchants are pushing back noticeable discounts to the consumer for using Bitcoin as a payment method. That's not going to happen in the short term (for the larger brands), because this is a chance to add to their margins. If they do offer a discount, it would need to be sizable to the point where it counters the 1.5% - 2.5% cashback and rewards people can get using Credit Cards, AND, the cost the consumer paid to get into Bitcoin and take risk of holding a portion in that volatile state. 5% probably wouldn't shake the tree, but 10%+ I think you would start getting peoples attention.
There's a really long way to go, but it's all being worked on by the community 24 hours a day 7 days a week :)

We've worked with Mercedes, Tesla, Hyundai/Toyota and done Motorcycles (1). As mentioned in OP's post. We arrange for the user to speak with the dealership about the product they're purchasing, following that, we then speak with the dealership regarding the payment and once we've completed identity verification on the user, the user does their own paper work for signing of the purchase and usually they're required to put down a deposit of sorts. It's really straight forward and is hassle free for Bitcoin users, which is why others have done it. I have no chance in stopping this onslaught of "It's BS, it's BS marketing" but honestly, we're an honest bunch of guys who do everything by the book, we're not going to pull some marketing tactic like this. If you don't believe us, speak to OP, ask him the dealership or speak to the others in this thread and ask them about where they bought it and then contact the dealership for verification. It's all legit. We don't control all the BTC addresses because we use BitPay, but OP could provide that info if he wanted to verify it. It's not our place to say these things.
Edit: spelling (probably needs further editing)

Not really, I think "adoption" for the banks will mean leveraging the underlying protocol. If they did offer that, it would just be a marketing spin on their same services already offered (for cold storage you can just use a safety deposit box) - However a wise move would be for a bank to come out and say "Now offering dedicated cold storage for digital currencies", it would obviously just be the same as what they're already offering, but they'd sponge up a whole bunch of new customers from the crypto space.

I know what you're saying, but honestly, we can't control what users post. We can't tell them to remove it, I've emailed OP and requested him to help confirm it, but it's up to him... Believe me, this is how we feel right now. [This.]( 
We have everything on hand to verify it, but I don't think that's fair of us to do without OP. The twitter comment was because someone requested it to be posted from our twitter account. 
There's literally nothing I can do right now without OP giving the thumbs up. We just have to roll with the punches. Any ideas on how to clarify this is appreciated. (without needing OP)

I think bitcoin is incredibly undervalued. But on the same token, Coinbase be worth 10% of Bitcoin? I could see that.
- They would own &gt; 10% of the (functioning) wallets 
- They'd be responsible for &gt; 10% of the money coming in and out of the system. 
Not saying it's accurate, but just saying that I could kind of see where they're coming from.

I think we should all collaborate on it, but I had a chance to meet the team from Pheeva whilst I was at Money20/20 and they're a really great bunch of guys. Passionate about bitcoin, and making slick products! I'm definitely in for supporting it, so long as we could all get a bit of understanding as to what it would be!

I didn't even know OP had posted it. Until this morning. One of the things we check (and other BTC startups would do the same) is our name in the search bar of reddit to see if there's complaints or user feedback. So that's why we stay attentive. Reddit usually provides lots of questions and it helps answering them for others because everyone can see it. So right now, we're getting slammed with "fake this fake that" - We literally can't do anything about it until OP delivers.
OP isn't the only one who's posted a story. Lot's of people have. Because lot's of people get a thrill from spending their BTC's. We see it everyday on reddit. Look through previous posts, check user account activity or whatever you would like. We don't ask users to do this for us, true story.

Well, it's very similar to Coinbase. They just don't charge a fee. So it's like a free version of coinbase, but with a more fluid user interface. 
Think coinbase + Free + simpler, cleaner interface = Circle.

I prefer it over coinbase now. Just cleaner.

Right, and exchanges ID you just as much as Coinbase does. 
The growth of bitcoin adoption is 100% directly attributed to services like Coinbase (Circle, not really)
Yes, it's been around for only 2.5 years, but it's put bitcoin in the hands of over 2M people. 
I'm not saying it wasn't possible to get bitcoin, I'm saying it is now just incredibly easier. If you can't see that then I think we just agree to disagree I suppose.

Generally, exchanges provide simple on ramps for money to flow in and out of the bitcoin economy. Having that located here in the United States and being regulated, will allow it to tap into traders looking to get into bitcoin, along with institutions etc...
More onramps = more money into the currency. (does also mean the same for money to leave the platform)
The price ballooned heavily toward the end of 2013 because of the on ramps to bitcoin in China and the comfortable regulations. The onramps were cut off (difficult work arounds were put in place) and the regulation got squeezed, thus cutting the flow of money into bitcoin. Hence a whopping decline.
This is a very generalised overview. Nitty details don't really matter in the context of understanding.

What's the problem? You want to buy on credit card or with ACH and they're not allowed to take a credit report? This is risk mitigation, not a reason to kick and scream, isn't it? 
C'mon, they're a platform and on ramp to bitcoin, so they've got regulations and business practices for risk mitigation they've got to adhere to. It's all about convenience, that's the service they provide and there are risks associated with it for both them and you as a customer. It's not for everyone, but I think it seems reasonable.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:48:53

"Commercialize blockchain technology" would be a more accurate statement. "The Blockchain" implies the bitcoin blockchain, which I don't think is the tech they're building on top of. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:19:31
I see what you're saying, 100%. 
The thing is, the target market for a trader is somebody with some form of disposable income or just income. This targets an older group of people (not somebody training to be a football player through highschool/college). Given the older group, it would come more responsibilities such as families, partners, financial obligations/bills, etc... 
So I think I'm just saying, sure we can let everyone learn their own lessons and what not, but why not disclose the facts first. "Majority of you will lose money, this isn't a winning game for most. Almost everybody will lose if you are not experienced"
It writes a lot better than an article in 2 years time with 10,000x the horror stories and larger amounts of wealth being lost because of not putting up warning signs. The net outcome for bitcoin would be that it scars larger amounts of people in the long term if "everyone becomes a losing trader"
More people scarred --&gt; more people hate crypto --&gt; more people talk badly about it --&gt; more people shun it away.
When people lose a lot of money doing things, the word is tarnished from households. Be it stocks, horse racing, whatever. But gambling is a really tough thing to repair losses from. Not just personally financial losses, but things surrounding families and relationships.
I do agree that I take a more conservative approach to this. 
But I think with an article like this, it would paint scenarios instead of telling people how bad it can be. It's a series of case studies and testimonials. It would speak for itself. Yes, it would display a lot of bad stories and that is it's intention. 
But imagine if the article was on "One trader who made over $1M trading bitcoin throughout the holidays"... What happens next after that? ... People will jump all over it trying to be that next guy. When in reality, he was an edge case. Then we have to deal with a throng of people saying how stupid bitcoin is because they're all bitter about losing. When it could've been avoided really easily. You can disclose the information people want to hear, or the information people should here. I believe the "bad information" is going to provide a better outcome for bitcoin long term.
Agree to disagree I think here.
100 bits for the back and forth
edit: screwed up the changetip thing :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:05:23
This makes complete sense to me. The price has been absolutely crushed. The notion that everyone is making money off that is ridiculous. 
The article is trying to illustrate a point of how broad this landscape and hobby/job is reaching into peoples lives (that's a good thing). It will probably analyse how so many people have lost money (Not the greatest thing to hear). Although, shying people away from becoming "Day traders" when they have no idea what they're doing is ultimately a good thing. It only shows them in advance that if they don't know what they're doing, they shouldn't dive head first into it.
Unfortunately, like most people that become "traders" in anything (Forex, stocks, etc...) they lose. They don't have the information first to act on, and are usually the last ones to the party leaving any room for the market to compensate them for their knowledge they're betting on.
It's a harsh reality, but (majority of) people get a delusion of expertise after a few small victories in trading, when all they've done is been gambling.
Trading crypto has fairly low barriers to entry so I think people should be mindful of the risks associated with it all.
I feel like I'm a parent taking this more conservative approach, but I just don't want to hear about more people getting burned from not totally knowing exactly what they're doing.
Sorry for the long post!

So how do people get into bitcoin if these services don't exist? Bitcoin's value is directly correlated to the simplicity of obtaining. If you can't get it &gt; Money can't be brought into the network &gt; Value (in a $ amount) diminishes. Now I'm not all about making 1BTC = $1M, but actual value aside, how do you expect everyone to leverage such amazing technology? We'll all just jump onto local bitcoins? C'mon, you need to be reasonable I think.
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:48:51

I think the second layer he's referring to are still on network, just not directly on chain (e.g. Lightning). Coinbase is the same as an IOU written on a piece of paper pretty much, with no direct connection or relationship to the network (if it didn't want to have it).

It's not really a problem anyway, patents aren't worth a drop if you can prove you were doing it prior to them. So if they've been doing some cool stuff behind the scenes since 2010 and kept hush hush about it, then fair play. Otherwise, if they're patenting stuff that is already looking like it's out and about from startups and what not, they won't be able to stand on those patents.
From what I understand, that's the TL;DR on patents? Anybody clarify that?

No they don't. TV ads are huge costs for poorly calculated returns (in the world of startups). In a business with razor thin margins, like Coinbase' - It's suicide. Bitpay is an example (granted their business is dependable on people having bitcoin, but still...)
If they were selling microwaves or home appliances, different story... They're selling currency, and trying to find a way to sell you $1 for as close to $1 as possible.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:52:54
- Exchange fees
- Illiquid markets
- Poor FX rates (due to point two)
- Slippage/volatility between trade
I'm on your side, but let's not be naive. It's not $1 to send anyone in the world as much money as you want.
It's $1 to send bitcoins which are not of value to &amp;gt;99% of businesses (yet). So it's not the same as sending a brick of cash to someone, it's dollar value may be the same, but it's realistic/useful value is not.

The main reason is that Venmo attracts a ton of fraud. 
So I tried it out as I was researching the space of P2P, and did a handful of different payment methods (Online bank transfer/Venmo)
When I did Venmo it was like 50% higher people were willing to pay.
I only did one transaction and it ended up getting my account closed. Here's what happens...
Guy gets stolen bank details or credit card ===&gt; Creates Venmo Account ===&gt; Puts higher price as an incentive for somebody to receive payment via Venmo ===&gt; Sucker (like me) bites, and does it ===&gt; He gets his coins ===&gt; I get stuck with a closed Venmo account and the funds not being credited to me. Terrific.
Totally stupid, I know. But I wanted to try it out... End result, got scammed, and can't use Venmo anymore :(
Hope this helps!

Hey Grainfromrain, I'm one of the founders. This was actually a bug which is being updated! After you make a purchase it was freezing accounts. We sent out an email a few days ago letting users know, and just reach out to customer support on the chat and they'll get it unlocked ASAP for you.
The inconvenience is obviously a huge pain, (I get that as I've had my account frozen on other services) - But this is just merely a smaller issue on our side, and (I'm assuming) unrelated to your account.
Thanks for your patience!
Kind regards,

For the most part they don't hold any.
Think of bitcoin like inventory to them, and then think of other exchanges like Bitstamp as their supplier. You pay them, they'll go get the coins from the supplier.
In order to streamline your experience they may purchase and hold some so you get a faster delivery, but most of the time they're just buying from somewhere else...
Since the launch of Coinbase GDAX they probably source their own inventory from their own exchange now...
Hope that helps a bit!

The amount being invested is not relevant, the proportion relative to his savings/disposable income is what matters. $5k is a very VERY large amount to some people, and chump change to others.
Your point on fees is certainly fair enough, because of the small scale, but a lot of financial products/platforms now can avoid fees. (E.g Robinhood and managed portfolios).
You're thinking too short term. You're not aiming to double your money in a year or even two or three... if you're trying to do that, just go to a casino...
If you're trying to safely accumulate wealth, and build a solid base/foundation on investing and growing your net wealth, this is the right approach.

Not trolling btw, I would genuinely like to understand why Bitcoin Cash touts itself as the best currency etc... Seems more like it's steering in a religious direction where the whitepaper is the bible and god is Satoshi.
No hate, but just genuinely confused because both sides of the conversation seem to have very bright academics pushing the agendas... I am not a bright academic, so it's hard to gauge what I'm missing. Afaict, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are the same except ones compromising decentralization as a short term fix, and one is not. Both are going to be a SoV until distribution nears 100% at which point MoE becomes more common practice.

This is the best thing for them as a business. No doubt this would be incredibly hard to do, but at the end of the day, the company appears to have made some decisions that weren't in their favor. This one certainly will be and hopefully gives them another shot at being back to where they were. 
For the love of god. Bitpay management - Your responsibility is to deliver revenue, and open source free to use projects are not going to deliver that. I get the reasoning of wanting to create tools to excite people about bitcoin but that's just far too abstract to expect to see a short term (3-5 year) return on that.
I love the innovative thinking, but leave that to another entity that started their business that way. Investors are going to get cranky very quickly when hundreds of thousands of dollars get burnt up on community OS projects.
I'm not hating at all, because I think you guys have done fantastic things for the community. However, in this position you're in, you really need to stick to your bread and butter. Save that stuff for later (projects).

Takes 24 hours to get into Coinbases account, for another 48 hours the end customer can basically "reverse" the transaction that went to Coinbase.

Tl;dr They applied for these 18 months ago when they were at a much smaller stage and it's just a defensive mechanism.

Oh no no, I totally understand what you mean. 
PayPal logic is their bottomline. They're not going to risk this that they're trying so hard to gain, by being patent trolls. Elon Musk (former PayPal founder) set the tone with what they did at Tesla. Granted, he's got nothing to do with them anymore, but community pressure would mean they're not going to go around swinging the hammer at young startups calling them out on patent infringement. 
People aren't going to run away from PayPal if they have the patents, I'm saying if they start shutting down startups and swinging the patent hammer around with new emerging companies and developers, they'll burn more bridges than it's worth.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:06:32


No, we are not taking a portion of your mined bitcoin.
So 21 Inc. is **not** taking a single bitcoin that is mined from my piece of hardware that I bought?

Thanks, very exciting!

@_date: 2015-09-25 16:48:34
I had a feeling you were going to say that... But yep, Paypal wouldn't do that because they'd burn a hole in their own demographic.
PayPal is targeting people moving money, and they've got a huge revenue monster of a company called "Braintree" that is targeted at tech startups and developers. They've been doing everything under the sun to try and get market share from Stripe (another payment processor) - This is the most important market for them because it's their income in 5-10 years time. 
Playing the patent troll game and squashing innovation wouldn't happen because they'd have this market flock away almost instantly. They wouldn't jeopardize this. By the time the patents are ready and if they bought Coinbase, they'd be in an even deeper relationship with this market.
That's my thoughts, and I feel they're well justified.
They're a big company with lots of fingers in the pie, so yes, technically anything can happen... But I think they'd have a fiduciary duty to not take this route as shareholders would see revenues decline and future earnings vaporize from a community disservice

I understand what you're saying, but personally "Sophisticated attack" can't really be blamed here. Unless it was a hostage situation or they used CGI to digitally create Stephen or Brian making the request via Skype video call or some other means. Or even made the voices sound similar over a phone call, then yes.
But other than that, I really feel this was an example of bad practice.
As someone who operates a business that is a competitor to them, this is one of the worst things I can hear. In the bitcoin space, when someone gets a black eye, we all get a black eye. So I'm crossing my fingers like crazy this all works out for them, but when you're moving that kind of money, bad practice is not having a basic 3FA confirmation (Voice/Video confirmation)
I'm wishing them the best in their case, but gee whiz, I think they're in a tough spot to justify it. Either that or the insurance company should not be insuring a company in this space until they review their processes and operations of how they move money (I would've assumed they did this though)
Fingers crossed.

Possibly, but if Coinbase fails, I think bitcoin will have more pressing things to worry about than patents being in the wrong hands.

I'm a really big fan of the idea of OpenBazaar and all the hard work to make it happen, but I just don't understand how anyone is going to use it? 
It works only in bitcoin, and setting it up is clunky compared to what a traditional online seller expects. The UI is not appealing. While these all might seem like petty things, to the 'mainstream' person selling traditional goods, it seems like it is an experience far worse than what they're accustomed to having.
I'm not trying to sound negative, I just think that I'm not informed as to why it's an 'Ebay killer'. I feel like it'll just get washed out right from the get go with illegal goods and be a decentralized Silk Road?

What do you mean they don't do it for cash? Obviously they don't put up a banner, but I guarantee you if you walk into your local best buy and try by a TV or something for like $600, if you say "What can you do discount wise, if I pay with cash?", they'll chop $20 or $30 off for sure.

I see what you're saying, but I think some level of your own accountability on your own part is needed here. 
You want to use an anonymous marketplace, then don't use your same email address you use for everything.
I think that purse could assume that of their customers who are seeking so much privacy. The same way you would assume Purse has integrated Gravatar just to make it a more friendly user experience so people have profile pictures.
I see what you mean dude, but I think it's something you should speak to them about first because a lot of people don't click links and just read headlines and it looks a little scathing.
Just my opinion, hope they get a little more transparent about it though.

What concern could getting flagged pose to you to make you not want to be flagged. That's like painting a target on your back.
BUT... That being said, if you deal with companies that are not registered MSB's then they aren't legally obligated to do reporting.

If a merchant has a 7% chargeback rate, that is considered extremely high. Most main payment processors will not go near a company that has a chargeback rate that high. 1.5%+ is very high.
Take that into account, then say they're saving 3% on CC processing fees... We're now at ~4.5% in savings. 
All that bundled together, would it be worth the merchant offering a 3% discount or would it be better for them to just keep the profits and add to their bottomline?
Not arguing, more just putting it out there.
Edit: In addition, CC processing fees are high in America but not nearly as high internationally.
Edit 2: There are clear advantages for merchants, but focusing on cost is not the best approach.

Great piece, you really sifted through a lot of the noise over the past couple of days. Thanks OP!
It seems that the hammer is swinging one way, and that is against Wright. Not saying he isn't dragging out the proof, or misleading or things like that, but it could very likely be something like the following...
Wright is going to leave holes in his story to maintain provable doubt that he is not Satoshi. For whatever reason, this is very possible. I feel like the moving of the coins is more difficult and that's why it'll take time. Moving the coins may require a ton of legal work because of the trust that was established and things of that nature. Why did he do a bogus (and very publicly critique-able) method of proof is beyond me...
Even if Satoshi coins move, this still won't prove he is Satoshi or was Satoshi, this only shows that he's in control of Satoshi's coins. I definitely think that he has the pedigree (along with his network such as David Kleiman) to be a contributor and early person on the team who are the creators. It would seem very naive to think that a person with his pedigree (It's a legit background from what I understand?) and his close ties with David Kleiman, and the amount of smoke surrounding the topic and his name, that he's certainly associated with early developments.
I think the value is closer to $15M on the date of the trust (you cited $30M, just an fyi)
Thanks for the post, it's probably the most interesting piece I've read since this all started!

From a regulatory side - Uber credit is far different to holding an account balance. (Ignoring bitcoin but more meaning you don't store a USD balance with them, you store an "Uber Credit" balance). That's the hassle, not the technical implementation.

If Uber does it, it would require a Coinbase account for direct debiting if they do implement. Afaik Stripe doesn't offer the subscription method of payment for bitcoin.
Uber/Lyft would (more than likely) not be willing to sacrifice the user experience advantage of never having to fiddle with your device after the ride, to cater to the (the small amount) bitcoin users.

Can you elaborate on  please? I always hear about micro-transactions, but on chain, I can't see how it is going to be sustainable. It's far more efficient using an off-chain service. 
Being far more efficient using an off-chain service then moves me to think that bitcoin has nothing to do with the ability to me to changetip somebody a fraction of a dollar. It's basically Venmo with a withdraw option of bitcoin.

No worries, at the moment it's a hybrid of sorts. Part automation, part manual. Alot of what you've said is pretty much spot on, although at the moment we're doing more manual than automated. We initially were just going to do it all as automated as possible, but starting off we needed to get a better understanding of the flow of processes so that the automation works better. It's a lot easier to understand the flow with hands on experience and not guess work. The past 3 weeks have been great for us understanding the operation flow and then we'll write it up! 
TL;DR - It's part automated, part manual for the moment. This is so we can optimise the automation and know the process flow better from experience and audit items that are being purchased (Guns/Liquor/Etc...)

Define "masses" - Masses by number of people? People in developed countries would be considered anything but "the masses"... They lack an incentive/need to use them...

Thinking of all the other people who can't access banks and financial tools to help transfer money around, these are your masses.
People in developed nations will eventually come around to the concept but it's going to take more time. People need more benefits placed in front of them so that they want to understand it more, instead of being force fed.
The problem (in my opinion) is that people just don't see anything but dollar signs. If they get bitcoins now, it's because they've heard "All these things do is keep going up..." But if people were given an understanding as to how technically capable it is...

What I'm implying is that he's not telling the truth: Edit - Perhaps not so much "not telling the truth" but more so "not expressing his true intentions". In such a competitive space, there's no way that anybody in this space would neglect the opportunity that was capitalised on. He's clearly an intelligent guy to get where he's got, so that's why I find it hard to think that he would have no interest in it when it's one of the most talked about topics in finance at the moment.

Because they're so close to the regulations. + Banks putting fear into every business. The horror stories of money being frozen, accounts being denied services if they mention the word bitcoin. We went to SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) to start our company accounts.... The conversation was going great, they loved what we had done previously and were extremely excited about us working together. Laughs, chat, jokes and just general good relationship establishment.... Then I dropped the "B" word. Went from hero to zero in milliseconds. Mentioned that we'd be utilising bitcoins in our company and products moving forward. It literally went from "smiley face bank representative" to "I'm your mother and I've got your report card in my hand" kind of face. The show was over, the conversation wound up almost immediately. Thanked them for their time and left feeling unfulfilled that a bank that specialises in new technology and being the pioneering institution for some of the best startups in the world, was just going to be so unwilling to participate in what is going to be the next revolutionary technology

At the moment, they're still in private beta testing to 1k +/- users... There's no fee at the moment either, and won't be for a while.
I've integrated them with coinbase which offer zero fees up to $1M in transactions. It'll be a while until that happens, following on from that, it will be whatever fee the "breakeven" is. Because this isn't part of their revenue stream.

bitcoin would be the worst thing to their business model. The company has razor thin margins and runs is an unprofitable company. They make money off fees in transactions and also make money off the Amazon credit card.
Unfortunately, for them to start accepting bitcoin, Satoshi would need to move out Jeff Bezos as CEO.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:38:05
They won't and here's why - They make too much of their money on processing cards, they have the amazon credit card which is a big earner for their company, they're public traded which means if they announce that they're accepting a volatile crazy form of payment (which we all understand, but the general public see's this as a negative/money laundering/dark currency) the stock price will take a significant hit.

Largest userbase compared to nearly all platforms. Most integrity/validated users also (fully verified, real people on more accounts than any other platform).
This means you'll get a larger population of the "user" not just the inner sanctum of people that have an echo-chamber opinion. Feels more realistic to broadcast the question to the largest sample size instead of just a small niche group. 
You could have options including "Pass my vote to group X as I'm not informed enough"
Something like that seems like it would carry a lot more legitimacy. 
In the same notion if you ask for their thoughts on scaling and for their thoughts. I think we can guess the poll results before it started.

This guy is brilliant to listen to. There's so much content of him talking about BTC/Digital Currencies in general. Great to listen to!
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:35:37
You're missing the point. It's not about volatility or anything like that. It's about them making money. They make money off transaction fees. They don't want to come out waving a flag they're cheaper than they already are, because they make money off being able to facilitate transactions. 
Also, the mainstream investor in Amazon and shareholder would not be happy about it. It's a publicly listed company, with everyday shareholders. These people are uneducated about bitcoin. They see it as some crazy scary yo-yo of wealth. That would reduce the investor confidence and thus risk their stock price even further.
I want them to accept it, but it won't be for a while.

@_date: 2013-11-25 02:16:24
I bought my bitcoins at the start of the year.
The real ride will start because it's not going to be about "x ROI" it's going to be about dollar value. The more money there is in it, the more movement the price will have (in a $ value)... 
Just like the swings were $2-$5... Then $5-$20, then $25-$50, now $100 +/- in a day is not feeling that uncommon...
When this turns into +/- $500 or more, peoples wealth is going to be swinging dramatically.

Hey, at the moment, it'll be the USD value equivalent in BTC. I know it may seem a bit weird, but we need to do it this way for the moment. Because if the price goes down significantly then it would be unfair on you, then if the price goes up significantly everyone would be claiming refunds. So the most fair way to do it would be the USD equivalent.

snapCard doesn't charge you anything until you order the item, so you don't actually convert anything or lock in a particular price until you've made your purchase. The price is live and moves with the market so you won't get committed to a single price for multiple purchases! :)
Zero fees for black friday! :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:47:40
Yes, that's correct. We create the transaction for the user based on what they're purchasing. This will then sit on our server and validate. Once validated, it will charge your primary method of payment (in this case, it would be bitcoin, if the user didn't add a credit card or paypal). Let me know if you have any more questions, I'm happy to help (I'm the guy from the video..)

Don't worry about mBTC or anything like that. The growth will still come, in my opinion. It will come from Hedge funds/investments putting portions of their portfolios into BTC. In order to stay competitive in the Hedge Fund game they'll need to do so. [One hedge fund has already done so]( The results they got will not go un-noticed by anybody in that space. Right now, they're plotting investment points and strategies for bitcoin as a portion in their portfolio. 
I agree with what you said, $1000+ is intimidating for the every day person, but hedge funds and investment firms will drive a lot of the growth. (I don't have a crystal ball either, but I think this makes sense)

I'm a founder at snapCard. We allow people to shop online using bitcoins. This is the exact system we use. Users can return items to amazon/asos/newegg/Walmart/etc... Same process applies. The user is refunded their initial cost in fiat. All our users have been very comfortable with that. Always open to suggestions if there's a better option available that people would like. We're in a startup incubator program and it's our most common question amongst investors. They think this approach is the most natural to start with.
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:26:20
We've got some cool things coming up to remove the 1% from users yet still allow us to make enough. So I'll write up some stuff on our blog after we've done some more user testing and got more product feedback.

No you don't have to give us private keys or anything, you can either choose to have "pay per purchase" which is where we provide you an invoice after each purchase which you pay using QR code scan or sending to the wallet address, or you connect your coinbase account and we debit it automatically after the transaction and then send you a receipt of the transaction.
