How long does it take?

Breadwallet is pretty great. Super simple. Their low mining fee that I can't change is killing me though. Takes forever to confirm.

Pure, mainstream btc usage will happen faster when we improve PR and UX

In most cases I'd give this comment an upvote, but I can't root for SA over the US

LibertyX, a btm, or localbitcoins in a public place
@_date: 2016-04-06 02:23:26
So good

It also harms "bitcoin revenues." Bitcoin is inevitable, but it would come sooner if it wasn't being actively held back by banks.

Sounds reasonable. They published a company-wide audited balance sheet iirc. Also, they wouldn't have licenses if they were in the hole. Can someone confirm?
@_date: 2016-03-29 03:32:04
LibertyX 
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:44:27
16% fee? For that amt i'll stand outside their stores myself. Localbitcoins and LibertyX FTW.
@_date: 2016-03-27 18:35:24
This still that 16% fee company? Localbitcoins has more ex-US locations for cheaper I'm guessing.

So blatant
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:49:33
LibertyX and Localbitcoins are pretty solid
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:12:21
Any concern ab trezor and compatibility with future protocol upgrades?
