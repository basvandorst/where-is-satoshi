Thats the worst argument against an experts opinion. Your argument makes it seem like a gamble. 
Warren buffet in his many years of investing has seen things as unstable/iffy as bitcoin and been smart enough to pick and choose what is good enough to warrant an investment.

Its unstable, 
Its not. Currency its an investment. 
I invest in bitcoin. I dont treat it like a currency. 
People on this hub saying converting your life savings to bitcoin is stupid,  because its not a viable currency. 
Im gettinf out of bitcoin this month to a 300% ROI. 
I didnt make millions. Or even thousands but i got my beak wet.

Then should you sign a waiver barring you from welfare when you lose everything because you are stupid and lost all your money. 
Thats not a real thing so the government takes an active role in protecting the public from things that hurt them, to avoid things like depressions/bubbles

Yes it is, amazon got fined a decent amount of money for doing that on primeday

Can the SEC punish people for insider trading within a company that is not publicly traded? 
I thought bitcoin whole point was to be untouchable from the government

Is your priced locked in? Or is it the purchase price 7 days from now? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:17:45
Woah bro, you mean to say that sometimes government protection of US capital is a good thing?

Exchanges make it easy to put in and take money out. 
People will use them. 
I dont want use coinbase because they dont trade small ones like ripple, are their any that do? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:20
I just pulled 100usd out and paid 2.99.
Why is it 40 dollars?

Lottery tickets and trading futures (what bitcoin is at the present moment) have as much in common as a horse and a car do. 
One is gambling, one is investing. 
Even a moron knows not to put his life savings in the lottery. 
When it comes to investing people stand to lose alot more. 
Also, many people, like yourself, think you are good at investing until you lose everything. 
Bitcoin is not a sound investment and is as speculative and risky as trading options, futures, and real currencies at a 200x1 margin. 
That being said, i have grown my portfolio with bitcoin/altcoin about 120% this year which is phenomenal but not sustainable. 
Bitcoins price dropped by 50% the second it entered the big boy market because people can now trade against it.

I actually want to buy ripple, who lets me do that
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:17:26
This definitely one of those "time or crayons" moments

I used coinbase for the first time, i am still waiting on my coin to arrive. 
That was 8 days ago, it arrives today. 
Im hoping i wont have wait times like that after my first transaction

Again, if the united states government, really wanted to erase bitcoin from the global stage. It could. 
It would be so easy.  All I have to say is Bitcoin is threatening to the stabilize the United States currency as well as other International important currencies to get the other countries on board they all outlaw the use of Bitcoin inside of their respective countries Bitcoin no longer has a practical use in the value drops to next to nothubf

Thats the same thing as selling. 
Forex does is the same principle
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:02:57
Damn that is awful
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:16:58
Cool, 
So my btc "arrives" via coinbase, in 9 days so the 15th, will it be purchased what i bought it for today? Or what it will be right before the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:44:09
What is replay protection? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:48:32
This post is funny, because if a government wanted to fuck up bitcoin, it would be done yesterday.... 
They realize that it can benefit them in the long run here. 
No, there will not be revolutions over this, no one will even protest, buncha kids on the internet will go back to school. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:05:13
Whens the fork? 
My first trade goes through in 9 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:08:37
First transaction
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:40:43
It could be, if people keep treating it like a commodity and not a currency.
