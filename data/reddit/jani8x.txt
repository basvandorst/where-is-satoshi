Already can be done or will be possible in future?
I don't think smart contracts are yet possible on bitcoin blockchain.
-edit: why downvoting? I'm asking a question...since I might missed something.

U were selling BTC from Silkroards, using mixers, who knows what else. When they send u questionaire you lied.
Something like that maybe?
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:21:06
I actually think market is needed because of trust and securing the blockchain.
I will not trust multimillion transaction on a 1000 eur worth blockchain for example.
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:13:32
Chances are close to zero.
It would only work if there would indeed be double spend AND at the same time two same height block would be discovered AND each would contain one transaction (one real one for u, and the other one with same inputs for fraudster) AND then chain would form on top of a block that is in favour of a fraudster.

Don't u think DAO, smart contracts, etc.. have any value on this planet?

I've heard u can do transaction delayed in past since not long ago.
Are there any other way of smart contracts that one can actually use today?

Bitcoin isn't best solution in this case for you.
Use Transferwise. You will pay 0.5% and they will use middle exchange rate for conversion. It will take days or a week, but ur case I believe is not time sensitive.
@_date: 2015-06-06 08:40:36
There is a service called Reload by Bitnik.
You can connect like 15+ exchanges and they can BTCs back once u spend them from your wallet.

I've seen many arguments for increasing the block size to 20MB.
Now let's not diss those arguments just for the sake of personal interest or whatever reason, but let's focus on getting arguments for other sutions.
We'll need to change something soon - we all know that. And if there are no other arguments we'll need to take the best approach for now, while continue discussion on scaling even more tx per second.

Dear your account is as it says on the screenshot pending additional KYC/AML. 
 
It is not standard for this to happen, but in rare cases it does. As said, when alerts along the chain are raised, it is required from all the parties to follow the law. We are doing our best to resolve this situation as soon as possible.
 
I'm sorry about your experience. I know it is painful to be unable to move your funds at the moment, but everything is transparent for you. Our support is working on your case with the highest priority and most importantly: your funds are safe!

The only thing I'm saying is that I was waiting for my transaction 2h for it to confirm. Now how is that gonna be solved I don't care and don't know. But I care that transactions are confirmed instantly.

[Cashila]( to send EUR to any bank account in Europe.
Also integrated in Mycelium wallet, to make payments straight out of the app.

Very true. But I wonder what that means for depositors. It means they have deposits now in some untradable currency.

Cashing from ETH happens mostly on BTCETH pair. In that case, USD is not affected. And ETH is not yet pegged to USD in many trader's minds.

True. But when price moves for 10% after 2 weeks of price stability I get curious why.
@_date: 2016-02-14 21:45:01
You didn't read the text and comments? It's not fan boying the price. It's relevant discussion.
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:57:21
My guess is lots of uncertanty with block size debate. People were discouraged to buy or sell. Also note that on many days BTCUSD pair had lower liquidity than BTCETH.

Then buy some bitcoins there and use service like  to send money to an account in Europe.
It will be way faster and cheaper than without bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:51:37
BTC ETH. Most of ETH buying and now potentionally selling is done with BTC (BTCETH pair in this case). And not via USD. Therefore BTC price rising in USD can not be directly connected with people selling ETH and buying BTC.
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:39:46
But fiat can't come in during the weekend.
And I also believe many bitcoin observers jumped into Ether instead of Bitcoin too.

Hi to ur friend :P
Tell your friend, that we can not process funds that are obtained illegally. For example, if you are selling on SilkRoad and cashing bitcoins out via Cashila that's not gonna work.
As long as you are using it legally you will be OK. If you do unreasonable high volumes, we can ask how you earned ur bitcoins.
We're definitely not PayPal (what a pal?!?) type of a company.
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:18:05
Where in Croatia?
I'm in Pula right now and can sell you that amount easily.
Also worth checking:  or Mycelium local trader
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:40:14
You should switch your position and ask yourself how to spend Bitcoins directly. So that your position is always in Bitcoin:
- spend them online/offline where they have BitPay or other payment processor   
- use Xapo or any other card which allows you to spend your Bitcoins wherever they accept plastic  
- pay your bills with Cashila or any other service  
- use LocalBitcoins or Mycelium Local Trader when you need to convert Bitcoins into cash in hand
That way, you don't need a bank anymore. You can buy/spend/pay/cashout directly from your Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:02:28
Just as TCP/IP was in place from the very beginning. When Youtube came along, TCP/IP didn't change because of it.
It's more of applications that will be build on top of Bitcoin. At the moment, network is great (ok, it scales to what it needs to right now), but gateways are missing and real usage cases which can't be done with otherwise.
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:40:37

@_date: 2015-03-16 17:43:08
1st: the real price will be much higher  (by factor of 1k or 10k). nominal BTC to USD might be even way more than that factor.
2nd: almost everyone will use Bitcoins - they might not know they do, but they will use it. Think of all those who "don't use internet", but use tablets/phones for Facebook and Skype etc  
3rd: it will be very easy to obtain Bitcoin or to spend them  
4th: there will be another Blockchain (maybe Ethereum) for everything else that is not Bitcoin (value transmission)
5th: all retail payment will be linked to your real ID
I can think of those at the moment.

Cashila works in Europe with EUR.
If you are not based in Europe and you do job for EU company that is the perfect service for you then. They pay locally and you receive Bitcoins which you spent or sell locally. That way you get payments fast and cheaper than using PayPal / Bank accounts.
And best of all.. you don't even need your bank account for all that!

@_date: 2015-03-02 10:56:16
If they apply tax to you holding Bitcoin it would make sense for government to collect it in Bitcoin itself as a percentage of what you're holding.
It's too volatile to set tax in fiat and government can then sell it on the market or auction it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:32:59
Total number is arbitrary one.
It can be any amount. As long as it doesn't change - so you have a point with talking about unchangeability. And it does't change with Bitcoin, but it does with any fiat.

Premine is when developers premine coins and keep them for themselves. Usually 90%+.

I live in Slovenia - we have EUR as well.   
I might use ur exchange if it's in EUR, but for sure not if in USD - personally or for business.  
Why not? I'm also confounder of Cashila. We're doing paying into SEPA from Bitcoin. If we use USD exchange I can never know how much EUR will come to our bank account. So every day after 10-11am till next day in the morning (when banks publish new exchange rate) I have no clue at what rate my USD will be exchanged into EUR - might be into my plus or minus. Also, if your bank has good exchange rate, it might work with "only" 0.5% offset from the middle exchange rate of EURUSD pair.  
So it gets too unpredictible and too expensive.  
So we are solving this using EUR exchange. Kraken in this case.

For that reason we're not covering it right now. Sorry :/
Potential scenario for you would be if you will have something to pay in EURo countries. Besides using Bitcoin, which is awesome by itself it would in that case turned out to also be fastest and cheapest!
@_date: 2015-02-19 11:04:23
We are working on that kind of gateway -  You with Bitcoin can wire money to any bank account.
The trick here is regulation, since that is 3rd party transaction so we'll start in countries with EUR once publicly open.
But it's awesome as you can then pay literally anything with Bitcoin or send fiat money to ur friends, top up cards etc.
