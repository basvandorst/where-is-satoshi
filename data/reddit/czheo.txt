There's cost to mine coins(such as electricity fees). If the income to mine one coin doesn't payoff the cost, the miners won't do so. It depends on the (current or expected) market value of the coins.

understand ≠ believe. The more people "believe" the more value it has. I've seen many people who somehow understand how it works but don't believe in its value.

People think: "are you kidding me? I think my fridge is backed by electricity too."

You calculation is erroneous since Huobi is not charging for btc/cny but only btc/usd.
