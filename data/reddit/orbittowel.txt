Luckily I was able to snag onto a few wallet apps before their wallet functionality was banned. I sort of anticipated that it might happen soon. I have Coinjar and coinbase. Once I lose access to my iphone based wallets, bye Apple. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:23:44
Yeah, let's use and control our money and value how we want to. If it means keeping powerful countries accountable for killing innocent people and abusing the powers that we have given to them, call me a terrorist, but I think it is the right thing to do. That is why bitcoin is great, it doesn't matter what you think, I have control over my value, and where my value goes. I have my economic sovereignty.

Ok... what word would you like me to use instead of law for the observation commonly called Moore's law?
It has no theoretical limits, but it has physical limits. There's a point where we won't be able to reasonably create more efficiently designed chips. 
I don't believe many industries have the competitive nature of bitcoin mining. They make profit from their dynamic services and marketing, not solely from their efficiency.

Truecrypt is an open source encryption program that has deniable encryption features.

Ok really good info. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:28:42
What happens when you lose your trezor? I think part of the beauty of bitcoin is the ability to access it anywhere no matter what. Extreme encryption and throw that file everywhere
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:53:02
lol, I posted the 'poster' from this episode a few days ago. I agree. 
And thanks! I'm in a good spot to become debt free. I owe it to myself and my future. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:07:49
Yep, same here. It hit $2, but I didn't understand it then. And honestly, I wasn't ready for that sort of risk back then. $150 is a fantastic price to start at. Good job not waiting any longer. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:37:49
Not really. The US exports their inflation to other countries and more and more countries are backing off the dollar, just wait until it is no longer the world reserve currency. Then let's talk about how good our inflation is. Money's not free. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:31:26
Really? That's awesome. Thanks, I did not know. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:44:32
Hmm.. My phone's price app still shows $217, I guess their API is broken or something.

@_date: 2013-11-13 22:05:30
Correct. Money is not free (assuming you are not a big bank, federal reserve, or the stock markets)

@_date: 2013-10-24 01:37:14
Yeah, to me I guess that I don't really care whether my friends buy or sell. I just want to plant a seed. I'm sure most won't, but some might. It's not as much about receiving anything as it is giving and promoting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:33:34
That's correct. However, maybe we aren't meant to be spending more than we have. Our economy and society is based on constant growth, which is unsustainable. That's why there's never been an example of a perfect monetary system. A little inflation becomes a lot very easily. 
All that I'm saying is that it's hard to find what the solution is, when the economic world we're living in is in no way ideal. It tends to give us faulty perspectives. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:02:24
Thanks for the tip. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:25:19
I'm just now turning to my own digital wallet. I did all of that yesterday. And believe me, I started without any idea of how it all worked, I don't have a techie background. I used to use the online exchanges to store my coins, but I'd rather store the value on my own now. That's a great characteristic of bitcoin. 
I think the most important things are: 
1. Do not store your files unencrypted on anything! Encrypt your wallet and key files, and have some encrypted backups.  
2. "Decentralize" your files, so that if your house catches on fire or something, your savings will be safe.
3. Lastly, what I haven't figured out yet. There needs to be a way to transfer the value to someone else, in case something happens to you, and you're the only one that knows the encryption passwords. I guess that just means coming up with a plan, and letting them know. 
Let me know if you have any questions, we can learn together!
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:58:12
EDIT, myrinotomy is being sarcastic. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:12:23
The demand has genuinely increased. I think that at worst case, a correction would leave us much higher than $200. There's been a lot of press, a lot of public debate, new stores and companies opening. 
I don't like how you confidently said "It will". You have no clue what it will do and you're trying to give someone advice.
I see what you're saying though. I just don't think you can really compare other things to bitcoin. It's a globalized commodity with limited supply, a currency, an accounting system, a banking system, a messaging system, a financial protocol that's cheaper, more efficient, and secure than the current industrial standard. It's like an IPO for a system that's better in pretty much every way. If we are in a bubble, there's a strong chance that it could go much higher before it corrects. And it could correct down to $1000. The bitcoin trend is and has been logarithmic from the start. Look at every previous 'bubble' in bitcoin, where they start and where they end. $1000 is on the trendline for the next few months, it's not an unrealistic valuation for a technological innovation. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:45:56
Open source digital wallet. Backup the wallet and key files on a USB away from your laptop (what's the point of a backup if it's in the same exact spot?). Also, it might be good practice to encrypt both sets of files with a program like  It is an open source encryption software. Make sure to install truecrypt to your usb too, so that if your computer crashes you'll be able to unencrypt your file. I'm still working on that last one. 
Save no wallet or key files on your computer unencrypted. If someone hacked your computer that's where the money is.

just use one of the printers at the federal reserve 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:50:46
That's exactly correct. Inflation at ~6% and loans at ~3% interest. The longer you sit on the loan, the less value the loan holds.

That's exactly right. However, if you make good investments, your loans are much cheaper. I'm not very conservative with my investments, but I am a saver and pretty frugal.

If that's what you believe, I don't think this graphic disagrees with you.

Oh, I have more. Kinda use it as a savings account. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:59:07
Thanks, I believe the price will go up a lot. I appreciate your response because it's easy to regret this decision, even after one day with the value $50 more per coin. I still think we're early, and I've still got more than most investors. Money isn't everything in life, and I've got a lot to be thankful for.
It feels great.

1. That's no problem at all! USD does not have the same issues as bitcoin. This currency can be printed without limit! Everyone's rich! ;)
2. What are you buying with $.33? Look under arcade or vending machines, it's called urban mining. 
3. That has risk, just grow your bank huge, make really bad investments, and give debt away like crazy to enslave society. If you do this, the government will print money to prevent you from going bankrupt. 
4. Their value has been declining for a while now, you don't want to miss out on a price surge. 
5. Honestly, you are an idiot and should complain to yourself. But don't worry, you can say your card got stolen and Mastercard will cover you.

How so?
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:49:27
I have a good job. But it was my impression that I could pay off my student loans quicker and easier by making wise investments. I have been following bitcoin since early 2011. I am under the impression that it will be huge. And the bitcoins that I sold yesterday were set aside to pay off my debt. It worked out, and I recognized that it could have easily not worked out. Either way I would have been fine. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:29:29
It could also deflate, too early to tell. Money is very digital these days. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:03:20
That's not a bad idea, how could this be achieved?
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:00:43
that's exactly what I was going to comment...
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:47:33
That's right thanks. I've been following bitcoin since 2011, but only got involved in early march this year. Every time I try to outsmart the market I fail. I do believe in bitcoin. I think it's one of the most important things going on in the world right now. I'm going to join the long term club. It always seems to be the less stressful, more successful approach. :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:04:07
I agree and thought about it for the past year and a half. I do not regret my decision at all and I still have investments.

Thanks for your great response. I actually bought back in when the price was about $150 more than when I sold. Lost a few coins in the process, but I really don't want to miss out on bitcoin. I really believe in it, amd those ideas are enough to put my loans on hold. :) 
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:26:40
Promotional videos have aired on chinese national television. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:29:52
Except bitcoin doesn't have government backed mortgages allowing people that shouldn't be taking out huge loans to take out huge loans. The housing system pumps more and more money into the system than what the free market allows, which inflates housing prices to the point where it collapses under itself. Your parallel argument is very poor. Bitcoin is not backed by cronie capitalism. 
To OP: Stay with it, it has value. It's value can only go up, or it will fail. If you believe it will not fail, then don't sell until it has succeeded.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:48:27
They do all the printing for you. It's great because you just have to wait for the money to trickle down. Don't try to print money yourself or you'll get into big trouble.

Yeah, you can make a lot of things popular by saying they'll instantly rise in value. I just remember when btc was about at $250 there were all these posts citing him that it would make it up to $1000. I don't doubt it will, but I think that he mislead people into thinking there wouldn't be a correction. Not entirely his fault, people are dumb. Fact is, there wasn't a basis for his claims. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:24:44
great idea. we wouldn't even need a printer
