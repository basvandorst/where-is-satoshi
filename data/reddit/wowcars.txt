I vaguely remember some months ago reading about a state agency that presented a future trends report to the government in which it said that the state itself may fade in significance and gradually be replaced with non-state entities, (this was a government report mind you). It also talked in general about the coming decentralization and disruptive technologies among other things. It seems even some elements of the government are starting to come to terms with the coming changes. If I find the link again I'll post it.

Not endanger the global economy but endanger the government backed central banking fraud machine.

What do you think about this

That would be like a buggy whip cartel "studying" the effect of automobiles on their industry circa 1900. Only conclusion they can reach is that they are fucked.

As I think back I think it was from the CIA and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) which is tasked with making future predictions. I can't seem to remember the actual link I read that listed some of their predictions. Sorry, hope this clue helps in finding it.

Think bigger than that. Technologies such as cryptocurrencies, 3d printing, increasingly real virtual space will make the concept of non-contractual statism obsolete. Office buildings, roads, and states are largely old communication technologies. We don't all need to work in the same building or drive to the same city or belong to the same state to get work/communication done.
