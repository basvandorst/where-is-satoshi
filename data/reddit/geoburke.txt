At MOST, only 21M people can own 1BTC. Assuming that distribution, you'd be in the world's 99.8 percentile

I didn't think you could register domains with nonstandard characters

Why haven’t ANY browsers built native support for immutable, decentralized TLDs .bit, .eth, etc?
@_date: 2018-10-21 05:02:00
Hundreds of millions can do that to you

Bitcoin also doesn't do recurring billing. A gigantic hurdle to payments adoption.

Super annoying, but worth it. Today is the day MtGox loss claims are due. Nice reminder not to leave coins on an exchange ever.

As of yesterday you could have.

Agreed, but no one should have to leave for the movies days early just to make sure they get a seat.

Yes, the offline version is the way to go, but you have only one day to get a physical letter to Japan. Good luck.

The original bankruptcy claim from 2 or so years ago was only claiming the fiat value at time of loss (because the coins were, well, lost). 
But after the coins were found, the incredible news story was that bitcoin price had risen by so much, Karpeles could make good on 100% of bankruptcy claims by selling only a portion of coins found, and still have a billion dollars in coins remaining in his pocket free and clear.

Did they finally hash it out?

Not many people here will even recognize that reference, Grandpa.

Posted.  Thanks for the tip.

Litecoin.  Definitely.  Oh and I have a bunch of PPCoins I'd like to offload when the time is right.

And if not, anyone want to step up to the plate to create a free payment service for their town's shops and restaurants?

I love that it's going to cover a vast array of crypto-currencies, include litecoins.

There's the real possibility BTC will be worthless in 20 years, either having been outlawed or replaced by another crypto currency. 
My idea is to invest in a mutual fund that invests in cryptos, which will actively try to stay on top of the market.

As a rep of Crypto.st, we discovered that the site was down from being under attack... already.  Had the site up for a week; haven't even launched trading yet and already we're in the crosshairs.
Thousands of attempts from:
    10.224.157.91 - - [09/May/2013:04:18:42 +0000] "GET /phpshop/index.php?base_dir= HTTP/1.1" 502 172 "-" "-" "176.31.99.77, 141.101.99.115"
They don't waste time, do they...

The value could certainly be a lot more if big exchanges like [Mt.Gox]( or [BitStamp]( offered other cryptos. Looks like [Crypto.St]( will offer most altcoins. The more exchanges that carry altcoins, the more liquidity, and therefore the huge the potential value.
