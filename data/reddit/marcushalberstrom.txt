Lol this is absolutely a lie. Any rational investor prolongs paying taxes for AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. If you had the choice to sell today and pay $1k in 4 months, or sell in 3 days and pay $1k in 16 months, every rational investor would wait 3 days. This is investing 101.
This downwave is likely shorts propositioning ahead of an expected wave of phys selling in the new year.
Get out while u still can.

15% is insanely high, because what you are effectively describing is a savings account or CD. Even some of the best high-interest accounts available today only offer 5% APY, and you have to meet a super long laundry list of conditions to qualify for it.
Look up Allen Stanford. Famed Ponzi, one of the bigger after Madoff. Essentially was brought down bc people started asking questions about he was paying 5% on CDs when the best rates otherwise were in the mid 2s and 3s.

Look up Net Interest Margin, that will explain how banks give guaranteed interest rates on deposits.

Essentially, you would need lots of creditworthy people to want to borrow IN YOUR COIN and pay interest rates well above what you are paying out (15%) to be able to pay that.
If you are suggesting paying interest assuming the price of the crypto will go up in the future, that is the definition of a ponzi...paying investors with proceeds from newer investors

Stanford was arrested in late 2000s. I don't think you have any idea what you are talking about. 
Do you have any idea how interest is paid?

This is pretty obviously a signal that we should expect rapid appreciation in the yuan in the near future. The govt is basically daring people to put their $ in USD.
Kyle Bass should get out while he can.

Chinese gov roofed overnight deposit rates...if u area bank looking for yield, u run as fast as u can and put as much in CNY interbank market...which creates demand for CNY relative to other currencies
