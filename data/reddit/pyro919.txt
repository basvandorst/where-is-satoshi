Problem with that is if you don't follow through there's no recourse

Fairly certain that's a breach of the paypal terms and conditions.

I never heard of mybitcoin or tradehill, and I just checked my emails and found records of having an MT.GOX account and deposits being made to that MT.GOX account.
Unfortunately when I tried to log into the account 11 days ago it said my account didn't exist so I created a new one, and I've been playing around with day trading some BTC I had sitting in mining pools awaiting pay out after the MT.GOX incident.

Coinbase has some pretty awesome merchant tools for people that want fiat instead of BTC. Maybe you could do a little show and tell and explain that the BTC are converted to USD on the spot and the money would be wired to their account daily.

Doesn't look like Bitinstant will work since only Bahamas, Brazil, Cayman Islands, Kazakstan, Puerto Rico, Russian Federation, Turks and Caicos, Ukraine, US and UK/US Virgin Islands are listed as options.

There was a website on this subreddit a few weeks ago that dealt with buying mining share, you sent them 1 or more BTC and depending on how much you sent they offered a better return on investment of 1.1 - 1.4 BTC within 7-10 days or something along those lines.

I bank with USAA and not only do you not have to pay them any fees for ATM withdrawals, they'll actually reimburse you the fee that out of network ATMs would charge(up to $30/month).
@_date: 2013-05-05 15:56:03
in min qty of 300 or by trusting a stranger on the internet to handle a group buy and hopefully get you the product rather than just keeping your money from an irreversible transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:42:19
Very likely, but if you get in at the ground level there's not much they can do about it since transactions are irreversible on the BTC network afaik.

The question remains if someone with enough capitol/motivation ddoses a few of the major exchanges at the same time what would the market do?

If you watch the gox live feed for large buys/sells you can make a pretty penny.

Play the long game and you'll probably recover most if not all of your investment.

Any idea as to whether or not you can still claim your account?
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:09:10
I actually went by there today on my lunch break to do it and was impressed that bitinstant had the money in my mtgox account before the cashier handed me the receipt/confirmation. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 04:30:09
I tried to do that today and was told that I had to upload a picture of my license to dwolla's website and I'll need to wait a day or two for that to be processed.   It's now been over 10 days since I started trying to buy BTC, and I'm still stuck jumping through hoops, it's rather frustrating and aside from meeting some stranger with a ton of cash and hoping the transaction goes smoothly I don't really have any other options.   I see this as a major challenge/hurdle for bitcoin as it doesn't even take this long for me to open a bank/credit union account...
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:21:47
Same here, never had an issue with it.
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:12:51
Unless they're over they're daily buying limit.

Appeared to be working earlier today
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:01:42
Used them earlier this week and I had the funds in my MTGox account before the cashier handed me the receipt.

Was planning on signing up and checking it out.   I've been playing Satoshi circle, but was looking for something with a little more substance.  Can you PM me if you decide to do another promo I'd like to give your site a chance, but I'm waiting on Dwolla to finish verifying my ID before I can buy more BTC to play.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:57:13
$1200 + for 4.5 GH/s?
Aren't the BFL Jalepenos 5 GH/s and only $274 and the SCs about $1250 for 25 GH/s?  I know there's a wait for BFL, but it seems like Terrahash is going to have a wait as well.

I did the bitinstant to MTGox recently and got the confirmation email and checked that the money was in my MTGox account before the CVS Clerk had a chance to hand me my receipt for the moneygram.
@_date: 2013-04-30 04:32:33
No, to buy bitcoing I have to upload my drivers license to 3 ducking sites and wait 2 weeks to get "verified" before I can even purchase BTC from an exchange or meet some guy with cash in hand and hope I don't get robbed.
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:56:59
The $3.95 comes is a moneygram and stays constant afaik(for sure up to $160 from personal experience).    Then bitinstant takes their 3.99% fee, (In your example ~$1)   In your example the total fees are ~$5(~21%).   If you make larger deposits the fees are much smaller, for example I made paid $163.95 for $160 dollars to be applied towards my account.  Of that I received $153.616, the fees on that transaction worked out to be ~6% and if I'd made a larger deposit the fee percentage would be even lower. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:23:48
Namecoin should work though right?
@_date: 2013-06-12 23:51:44
You're 100% correct, I believe it's called a public records check.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:23:08
Sounds like a cool idea, but from a user interaction standpoint it seem much more cumbersome than swiping my CC and entering a zip code.

I've had relatively good luck.   The BTC didn't show up exactly when it was supposed to according to their estimate, but I created a ticket and had the BTC within 10 minutes and they apologized for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2013-05-05 15:53:58
USAA does everything you mentioned for free with no minimum balance that I know of(if they do have a minimum balance it's like $5)
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:01:43
Do you know if they deactivate accounts after a certain amount of time?
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:47:22
Bitinstant was super easy and I had the money in my MTGox account before I even got the receipt for the MoneyGram from the cash register at CVS.
@_date: 2013-05-18 16:58:53
BitInstant requires cash/debit since they'd be leaving themselves open to fraud/chargebacks if they allowed paypal/cc.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:33:01
Are they being produced by BFL or something?
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:49:24
Don't even need a verified account or anything, I bought my first BTC yesterday and from start to finish it took less than 10 minutes including the drive to CVS to make the deposit/moneygram through bit instant.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:04:11
They reset all the password if I remember correctly and you had to send them a copy of your drivers license and some other personal information in order to claim your account.  At the time I wasn't really keen on the idea of sending more personal information to a company that had just been breached and as a result released some of my personal information  to the world.
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:18:00
Where in LA? and are you open to people buying 1 or 2 BTC? or are you looking to sell the whole lot for $2,000?  I'm near LAX for work during the day and in Torrance at night.   I'd be happy to buy 1 or 2 BTC at roughly MTGox Price at the time of the transaction maybe + a couple % for convenience.

That stupid red phone just rings busy, you have to hang up and wait for it to dial 10-20 times before someone finally picks up, but it does eventually work in my experience.   Kind of had me worried about handing them a few hundred dollars though.

My wife bought the mooncup last month and she loves it so far.
We both agree that for women who use tampons this is an awesome idea, and we both loved your idea about having sweets, snacks, wipes, midol, etc. also available.

If you read more about it, it only claims to work with perfectly fair 50/50 games and unlimited funds which with BTC is fundamentally impossible.

I guess I got in at just the right time, took about 5 days from signing up with CampBX/Dwolla, then verifying and making a deposit from my bank account to dwolla transferring to CampBX, and then bought bitcoins and transferred out of CampBX the day before that announcement.

Especially given that SatoshiDice states they take a 1.9% cut of everything.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:18:23
Aren't they already directly related given that they receive 25 BTC per block discovered and all the transaction fees?

It's still in developement and if you register/play with it, it's not open to deposits/withdrawals and they give you  a fake $5,000 and 100 BTC to toy around/play with the trading engine.

1.9 million for less than 800 sq ft?

Considering they're not accepting deposits/withdrawals and it's more to get the feel of the trading options/engine I think it's more than enough for now.

I'm interested in how bitcoin behaves, but have no interest in development.   Why would I check the source code/github?development 
@_date: 2013-05-06 07:23:28
Think about it, I can pay $199 for item X or I can pay $199 + dwolla fee, exchange fee, and transaction fees to buy item X with BTC which would you choose?
I think BTC is an awesome concept but the fees are kind of out of hand.
