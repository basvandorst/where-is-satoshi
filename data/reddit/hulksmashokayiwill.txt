I guess you've never heard of the Pareto Distribution?

This energy debate is just ridiculous. Bitcoin not being green enough is just a total sham of a talking point.

Bitcoins are used for questionable purposes..... Really? I don't doubt that that's true, however more fraud and 'questionable purchases' are made with fiat than BTC. The constant attempt at making BTC seem like it's the devil currency is really annoying. Central banks, monetary inflation, and fractional reserve banking is far more 'devilish', IMO.

I'm confused. Didn't the banks in Russia just say they were all for bitcoin?

It's great that the demand is high, that shows confidence. But these exchanges need to beef up their capacity or they'll no only fizzle out but damage bitcoins potential in the process. Good on you for being an ethical business nonetheless!

Not yet.....I'm up in Canada, so to my knowledge it's a lot easier than down south.

Interesting. I was playing around with the demo UI, and it seemed like you could. Unless it's a beta?  Check it out, maybe I'm missing something.

Sooooooo did Iceland miss the memo or something?

I've heard of that new machine. But when will it launch? And I thought you could set the rates with lamassu, unless I was mistaken.

Totally. I mean, who in their right mind would listen to a guy who wants nothing but the best for people and for them to bring forth their greatest potential, all while reducing suffering in the world. Personal responsibility is for losers, right?

I didn't know you were the ultimate decider as to what constitutes genuine and what doesn't. 
See my earlier comment regarding thinking ones knowledge is complete.

Spoken like a true NPC. Who can't think for themselves. LOL.
Refer to my earlier comment...JP haters have the most to gain because they're usually a complete mess. Thanks for proving my point.

Not disingenuous. Probably just more open minded with a life that's in order. That's all. And don't be so hard on yourself, you're not make believe.

I'm a black jew. And I'm a chick. So...no. But nice try.

I've been viewing his lectures since years before he went maint stream. I often find that people who criticize him the most are the ones that have the most work to do as they seem to take offence at nearly every useful nugget of self improvement he offers. I have never seen a man so misrepresented in my life. 
Nothing wrong with criticism. Mindless criticism of the star-wars-nerd variety where 'everything sucks' and 'everything is just useless' while proclaiming that their knowledge is complete is just....self defeating.

Very racist. You could use some JP in your life. It's good for douchebags with daddy issues like yourself.

The bottom is 1k...all the big traders are predicting a crash. Again. 
Congrats on the investment but be prepared to be in the red for the next 6 months, at least.
