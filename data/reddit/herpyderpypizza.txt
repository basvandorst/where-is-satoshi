So...Reddit? Goes completely against the FB culture.

Who cares. You should totally sell if you can’t take the volatility.
I don’t care what anyone does with their crypto but Jesus grow a pair or gtfo.

I'd say it's merely the beginning but whatever. It's not like they have underlying fundamentals like how Bitcoin does.

Kudos for making bank and getting your life on a path to do what you truly want but do not confuse a yolo with investing. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:37:08
What did you expect? 1000%+ gains in less than a year on most cryptos. You’re delusional if you thought it could keep going up at the rate it was.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:11:22
Yeah, right.

TLDR: OPs comment is a nonsense thing
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:54:52
I can't say I'm in it for more than the other. Both.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:54:09
I completely agree. I'm so sick of the hate on these subs toward successful individuals.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:50:20
Y'all need to stop bashing Buffett. It's childish and does not add anything to the conversation of why crypto is needed for the future. 
Too many posts about things that have no affect on the long term.

You guys realize that he wouldn't invest in crypto, right?
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:46:24
Yes...that’s why there’s a + sign next to the 1000.
Basically unheard of unless someone invested in something like 20 or more years ago in a “traditional” investment.

Big if true

People who have no self-control give themselves diabetes. Is coke being injected into people without their consent?

My comment was removed for saying "You guys realize that he wouldn't invest in crypto, right?"
Good luck with your finances.

I knew what I was getting into. I will not hate on your post. 
I’m either going down with the ship or rocketing to the moon. I deserve whatever is in store for me. Hodling until I die because it was a YOLO bet. 
May God be with us all for better or worse.

Instagram and Whatsapp too?

With no respect intended, you sir, are a moron. I hope you figure out how to get me banned from this subreddit.

Not at all. This happens around the same time every year.

Usually when someone says “This is the next Amazon...” or “next Bitcoin...”, etc. it is 99.99999% not the case. It’s a marketing tactic to differentiate itself from Bitcoin. In a lot of respects, it’s true. Every current and future crypto will never be the next Bitcoin.

20 billion soon
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:04:10
All offense. This IS the stupidest thing OP could do with a credit card. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:26:34
Pfft ETH still good. Allllll in on ETH you complaining wench
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:21:19
Typical 20something goes into an expensive private university and doesn't work in the field he/she studied. You're right. Absolute waste of bitcoin and time.
