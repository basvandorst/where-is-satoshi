i think that naivety is a product of the fact that they have big brother as a backup plan. i think that if people were put into a situation where their choices mattered... where "voting with your dollar" mattered, people wouldn't be as niave. media control only works in centralized systems. obviously all the media on television is incredibly biased and it only allows for a certain subset of viewpoints, but thinks like newspapers, magazines, and the internet allow for all voices to be heard. the internet in particular is very unregulated. it's almost impossible to regulate. they havent stopped "piracy" and even china which is running a country-wide firewall cant even stop people from accessing the information they want. the internet is actually a pretty good example of the free market and anarchy in action.
in a true free market there is no central organization that controls it. it's decentralized. while when the government is in control there is someone you can buy to do whatever scummy stuff you want to do, in a free market you will only be around as long as people consider you useful, and once you stop being useful you are gone.
i feel like you don't truly understand how a free market works. so let's say for example you are running a business... and you decide that it is more cost effective to do something that isn't very environmentally friendly... well an informed public (meaning people that don't just assume the government will mop it all up) will decide that you aren't worth supporting and you will go out of business. you will then be incentivised by a profit motive to not do that or you will go out of business.
and listen... i'm not trying to judge you or attack your character, so i'm sorry if you are getting that feeling, because that is not my intention. though, my first comment about zeitgeist was probably out of line, so i apologize for that.
as for your final question:
taxation in my mind is theft. let's do a thought experiment:
what happens if i decide that i don't want to pay taxes? I will be caged against my will or they will force me to pay even more. that in my mind is theft. if not theft it is coersion which may as well be theft. now whether one considers that necessary for a functioning society is another story entirely, but that doesn't change the fact that it is coersion and theft.
if you want to do positive things with your life that's great, but you should make those things happen yourself without relying on stolen money in my opinion. you should make those things happen yourself. start a business that works on developing environmentally friendly things... or start a non-profit that works off of donations. the government will only restrict you,.

this is going to blow over. there are people running around saying the sky is falling all the time when it comes to bitcoin. those periods are becoming fewer and less frequent. over time i'm sure she'll be okay with it eventually. this might sound cruel but it is true you made the choice to leave your coins there and bitcoin cannot be blamed for that. i really do feel for you sincerely, but i'm glad that you are able to prevent yourself from shoving the blame and manning up to it. the sky is the limit when it comes to bitcoin. don't give up on it if it's something you believe in. there are other ways to get bitcoin other than spending money. you can offer services etc if you're a programmer or something of a trade nature.

Yes, please! one of the few things keeping me tied to using the play store is the lack of a decent bitcoin wallet in fdroid. if i could have a bitcoin wallet in fdroid that is updated regularly it would be 1 less thing keeping me on google play.

i think people would be more informed if they were required to be more informed, which they would be.
listen, i never said i was unwilling to share. i've made donation to programs that i support. but forcing me to share isn't me sharing. that is coersion and theft.  
freedoms don't overlap and contradict eachother. you should consider looking into "the non-aggression principle" and "voluntaryism". those are the freedoms i support.


all of those examples you use can be solved by the free market. buying comments and upvotes can be solved by algorithms and systems that prevent them.search results being altered etc would cause that search engine to stop being used with an informed public. all of those examples are things that can be solved without government intervention.

listen don't think you're a genius just because you watched zeitgeist.
the population is growing at an exponential rate where as the number of resources on the planet are scarce and static. your model is unsustainable. obviously things are ineffecient, but effeciency can only take you so far. and as the effecieny increases the population increases to match it. it creates a homeostasis.
also stealing from people to feed other people isn't the right thing to do. (taxation into welfare). they should let the free market deal with it. i think they would discover that without governments forcing people to give them money so they can ineffeciently redistribute it as they please, it would allow charities and charitible people to spend their money and resources way more effeciently and help a lot more people.

this is about spreading the word of bitcoin. bitcoin is serious and important to me and this is a place that is considering accepting it it, but is being corrupted by the fud that is surrounding it. i just don't want this to turn into a big joke about mtgox. i want this to be about a business that is considering using bitcoin and trying to rally people to clear up the fud and spread the word.
and for the record bitcoin isn't "magic internet money".

that is 100 percent false. i have moved keepass files between keepass and keepassx.
you just have to stick with 1.0 for now until keepassx implements 2.0, but there is nothing wrong with 1.0. it does everything i need it to, plus it is still actively supported right along side 2.0 by keepass in the same way gpg has active 1.0 and active 2.0

don't worry about it and don't sell them. when this thing recovers and you look back at how "unfortunate" it was that you picked them up at 800 you will laugh. you think that people who bought at 8 dollars are bummed that they didn't get them at 4? hell no.

there are dangerous implications and counter-party risk if they implemented a way to redistribute bitcoins from one person's wallet to another. it's a horrible idea and is exactly what bitcoin was created to eliminate.
i understand your point though.
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:09:22
i actually had the exact same thing happen. it took 5 days, 2 emails and i had to fill out their 2fa reset form  but i did get my 2fa disabled and was able to access my account again. interesting to see that i wasn't the only one.
by the way i don't know if it's only me or it happens with everyone but when I tried to use their form to disable 2fa it seemed to be severly broken. when i would try to submit it it would complain about me using illegal characters or like i was trying to input some sort of scripting language.  i wound up having to remove a lot of the puncuation from my comments section in order for it to submit correctly.
mandrik suggested that i use google authenticator, but i don't want to use google authenticator. i don't always have gapps installed on my phone.. so i don't always have access to the play store so google authenticator is a no go.
I avoid using centralized cloud systems that are outside of my control as much as possible. I don't use lastpass I use keepass. I don't use dropbox I have a nas etc.i really like blockchain because it's a cloud service but you control the keys. It's really worrying to see that their sms based 2fa isn't working correctly and it's making me not want to use it. I may start using something else for my bitcoin wallet rather than blockchain.
this all said i love blockchain and i love what they are doing. I love andreas, mandrik and roger. i think they are all doing amazing work for the ecosystem and the community, so this is definately not a slight against them.(or even the blockchain company.) it's really hard to scale up as quickly as people in the space are being forced to so I am trying to cut them some slack...
i hope they manage to get sms 2fa working reliably because i really love using blockchain, but if it's going to lock me out of my account randomly i'm going to have to look elsewhere.
by the way do they have a .apk for their android app posted anywhere... so that i don't have to get it from the play store?

google authenticator is open source? if that's the case i'll definately get it. i thought i needed google play to use it. if it's in fdroid that changes everything

I was hacked aswell. I have never used my account there to the point that i forgot that i had even had one. I made it ~a year ago. I'm not running a compromised system. I run linux and have not only not logged on that account since the day it was created, it's not using a shared password. I run noscript. I reformat my system fairly frequently(once every month or so.). I have not been on that site before making the account and since making the account. It's looking like they may have been hacked. everyone be careful. change your passwords everywhere. enable 2FA. Consider setting up a password manager such as keepass.

i think one thing you are missing about the free market is that it is actually regulated. it's not just pure chaos or destruction. for example if there was a business that was doing things that people think are bad or evil then people just wouldn't support that company which would cause it to fail. the people are one of the major regulators of the free market. there wouldn't just be a bunch of walmarts all over the place. the reason that walmart is able to do all of the terrible things that they do is becuase they bought off politicians to pass laws and rulings that support them. the government itself is way more corrupt than the free market could ever be i think.
people shouldn't be looking to the government to empower them they should be doing it themselves. what do i owe you? you think stealing my money and giving it to you is fair? not only do i not think its fair, i think it's also counterproductive. being able to pull yourself out of the mire and building yourself up is so much more powerful. i look around and i see so many people that are living off of different forms of social welfare and they have no incentive to change or better themselves because they can just rely on the welfare. i understand that there are people that are in unfortunate circumstances, but the community can support them (and they do and on a VOLUNTARY basis... not a forced basis.). the government basically poisons everything it touches.
all that i said there may sound harsh and it may sound like i don't have any empathy, but that actually isn't true. i really do feel bad for people that are in unfortunate situations, but i don't think stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is fair or even productive.

Well you can zero out the drive after you have the paper wallet and the watch only wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-05 06:12:28
i still would prefer to use armory on a computer that has never accessed the internet. this doesn't allow for hierarchical deterministic wallets, does it? so that means you are sending all of your coins to a single address which if discovered is a single point of failure, but also means that if you have a watch only wallet and someone manages to snag the public key they can see all of the bitcoins you own rather than having a hdr cold storage wallet which wouldn't let people know how much you really have unless they actually get your watch only wallet file.
though obviously having a dedicated pc for cold storage isn't something everyone can do, so for these people this is definately better than nothing.
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:12:55

I play a bit of magic online, and I was actually thinking about how distributing virtual cards as tokens would be an awesome way to implement it. You don't have to worry about them banning you and losing your collection that you have sunk money into. It would be really effecient for building infrastructure for trading bots. You wouldn't have to be logged into their service to trade cards either. Plus it would help to give "legitimate value"(legitimate is a word I actively avoid using, but i can't think of another word to use there) to the cards since they are tokens that can't be taken and redistributed by the company owner. It's really awesome that someone has gone ahead and decided to implement this.

i just bought a trezor the other day and i have it coming in the mail. i'm not going to be storing all of my coins on it. i'm still going to be using cold storage aswell, but here's my plan.
i'll be keeping ~%95 of my coins in cold storage ~5 percent in my trezor and then spending money on my phone. Having that ~5 percent on my trezor will make it easy to access more btc than i would feel comfortable walking around with without having to go through all of the trouble of offline signing and the headache involved in that. refilling my phone for example once i buy something. so it's a nice middle ground between the high security of cold storage and the low securite of a hot wallet.

I  bought this device 2 weeks ago and was devestated that you decided to change the license. I am so happy you reverted back to the old license. It relieves me because it tells me you listen to your customers and you actually do care. I bought your device and hadn't even considered buying any knock-offs. I don't think that many people will. there are poor security implications for buying knock-offs... for buying things that show up out of nowhere. I think you will find that all you need to do is put out a solid product and people will flock to your product. You have a brand that people are aware of. Don't worry about the knock-offs. I'm sure you will be successful and do well if you develop your brand and show the community that you make transperency and openness a priority. thank y ou for reverting the change.

Jupiter Broadcasting had a bitcoin podcast coming out in 2013 called Plan B(possibly even before lets talk bitcoin existed but don't quote me on that) that they wound up canceling due to there being a lul in the number of things to talk about. That combined with him already juggling so many shows, that it was hard for him to handle another one. i think techsnap dove deep on it even before that explaining how it worked. Chris(the guy running JB) has been into bitcoin for a long time now, though he doesn't talk about it much at this point.

dunno if they have an android app but as far as i'm aware android has openvpn support or atleast an app that will implement openvpn which is what mullvad uses. as far as how they compare to pia, i've never used pia, but they operate out of the US which is a red flag to me(dunno if that is merrited, but it just is), whereas mullvad is operating out of sweden
