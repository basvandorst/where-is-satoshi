It's interesting.  This chart represents the largest military in the world.  Yet Bitcoin represents how many farts I have after eating Chipotle.
But you don't understand the difference.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:07:16
Good luck with that.

They just discovered it this year?  Really?  I've known about it since the beginning.  
Are you saying that taxes just started this year?  Or the dark web was just created this year?
I know exactly how it works.  I've already stated this many times.  I just graduated a year ago with a Masters in Computer Science and my specialty was in Cyber Security and Data Integrity.  I know all about this shit.
Yeah, I don't open my mouth without doing proper analysis.  I was a professional financial analyst.  I made $100 million decisions before my cup of coffee.  I don't rush my shit.
That being said, this one didn't take long.

After my time on the trading floors and investment banks I worked in retail.  So I was your friendly neighborhood Financial Advisor.  
And it was heartbreaking to hear them believe in this stuff and lose their shirts on it.
I watched so many people go broke for so many different reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:54:34
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:08:45
That is awesome!  Good for you!  
You have the right attitude to take advantage of this situation.  
Right now I'm invested in my business.  New businesses tend to be a bit cash hungry.  So liquidity is not a problem of mine.
But in markets like this, I shift assets from growth stocks into value stocks.  It's old school and boring, but it works every time.  There are some great easy value mutual funds that you can move into.  
Your liquidity should be based on your whole living situation.  It shouldn't be a shift em around type of thing.
I hope that was helpful.  I know I tend to be boring.

Bitcoin is just a fad, and it is in a huge bubble.  
I've never been accused of fraud in all my years in finance.  And I worked at the highest level.  And spent years looking for bubbles as my number one job as an analyst.

What is a convertible bond?
What is a cliquet option?
Come on.  Take the challenge or keep your mouth shut.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:49:01
I agree, we are headed for a big bear market.  I think we are way over inflated by Trumpophiles' white money.  
But it won't lose 90% of it's value in one afternoon.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:46:05
I agree!  Everything get's hacked at some point.  Technology moves too fast and there are too many hackers.  
It's not if you get hacked, it's how you can handle it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:09
It is not a currency, it's a hoax.  Get over it.  
How much has it grown since January?
What is different this year vs 2016?
Answer those two questions for me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:43:17
There is a 99.99% expectation of loss of value on bitcoin based on historical pricing.
The roulette table offers a 47% chance of doubling your money if you pick one color.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:57:58
Okay, tell me what a convertible bond is?
What are the greeks for options and what do they mean?  How do use them?
What are the major differences between the major US Equity Exchanges?
How do Equity options differ from Commodities options?
I could do this all day.
My experience and knowledge is all I'm proposing here.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:18:28
I have a Masters in Computer Science and I worked at an International Investment Bank.  That qualifies me.
The price is 16 x what it was in January.  That is complete and total bullshit.  
I never said the technology was worthless.  I just said this rally is complete bullshit fueled by bubble chasers based on nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:34:04
16 * the price in one year is going to be a huge correction.
Anyone who buys here will get hurt big time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:07:37
Now you are speaking my language.
But again, this is not an F/X product.  It is a speculative bet.
Let's run the numbers.  
21 million Bitcoins total at $6,500 each.  
That's a $136 billion.  That's no joke.  That's a lot of money.  But only 2/3 of the Bitcoins are in circulation.  So someone would only really need $91 billion to rule that market. 
Do you think a hedge fund can bully that market?  Look at this [list](
Interesting huh?  Let's look at some more numbers.  
Let's look at [trading volumes](  
Now I know from experience that if I drop 50% of the avg daily trading volume on the market open, or in one trade.  I can change attitudes.  Then I drop the rest over the next few hours and I'm moving markets.
So all I would need would be 250,000 bitcoins to do that.  That is $1.625 billion.  Take another look at that list.  
I could make a few phone calls and raise that money.  Then start buying them back on the cheap.  
Their are $10 trillion USD out there.  $1 trillion in paper money.  That is a currency.
Bitcoins are a spec trade.  If an idiot like me knows how to knock down that market, what do you think my friends in the Hedge Funds can do? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:25:20
That was a clever come back!  
You are clearly a financial genius, and I am the fool.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:29:31
Agreed, but it's usually a calculated risk.  
When a bubble bursts, the market goes into free fall.  So it's not like you lose 10%, you lose 90%.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:51:13
Goes to show how market savvy you are.
There is a trader saying, 'You can't argue with an idiot, you can only get out of the way and let them learn on their own.'
I'm not kidding, that is a trader saying.  A smart trader only shorts in a logical market.  
This market is driven by the wisdom of people on Reddit.  I have never heard of an experienced trader even talk about Bitcoin except to completely dismiss it.
It's a great idea.  But the fact that it is not being used for transactions, but just being purchased by speculators has made it completely useless.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:30:06
What you are talking about now is Tax Evasion.
That is a different story.  
I'm not even going to touch that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:50:18
Awesome!  You are an excellent student!
It's called mean reversion!  It actually does!
Unless you think this is the first time in the history of the planet that it didn't happen?  
The rule applies to everything from growing grass, to crops, to bug populations.  
The only place it doesn't happen in nature is horrible diseases and cancer.  But those are controlled by humans and usually controlled by the bodies immune system.
It is a bubble.  It will crap out significantly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:52:06
You are very sad because someone is making a logical argument based on knowledge and experience that you do not like.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:47:45
You have no intention of having a respectful debate on it.
How can I lie about what a convertible bond is?  The only way I could is if you had no idea what they were either.  
Here you go, it's a type of pizza.  It's delicious.  Prove me wrong smart guy.  I'm just a teenager anyway.  You should be smarter than me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:50:20
Yes, this was a very similar scenario to [Enron](  It was a utility company.  
And as the stock price rose, people jumped on the bandwagon.  You even had top analysts, WSJ, NY Times, Washington Post all saying they would revolutionize the way Energy was created and distributed.  But there was nothing behind it.  
Really, only a few tech stocks ever blew up like this.  But they immediately crashed and burned down to pennies per share.  
And this isn't even a tech stock.  A tech stock might have a technology behind it that could support it's insane value increase.  
The problem here is that people are confusing this with a tech stock, and it isn't.  Anyone else can come along and duplicate this technology.  If you purchase it, you don't get to own part of the company.  
And worst of all, 1/3 of the Bitcoins are still owned by the owner of the company (Unmined).  So he controls the price right now.  
This really is a plan for the owner of the Bitcoin company to get rich.  
Also it is mostly being used as a black market and dark web currency.  It is used for tax evasion.  At what point are countries and the UN going to clamp down on it.
If you own some, and you've made money on it.  Please get out now.
If you don't own any.  Do not buy any!
It is a bubble like nothing I have ever seen.  Ever.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:49:10
Those are considered access points.
Exchanges and clearing houses are two organizations that verify trades so they aren't duplicated or technical errors didn't create a run away market.
Program Trading was the beginning of electronic trading.  And it caused a lot of problems that the markets quickly adapted to.
So let's say I want to sell 1,000 bitcoins.  And somehow the decimal point gets lost, and 100,000 bitcoin sale goes out.  That is the end of that market.
Because it doesn't have any intrinsic value, it won't recover from that mistake.  
And the person that made that mistake gets to do the buy back for pennies on what he sold them for.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:16:52
Okay, I found Enron, want to know how they did it?  It was called clique options.  Do you know what they are?
I traded $50 million dollars in stocks in one day and was 1% of the NYSE days volume on that day.  And I traded in every equities market.  
Do you know what a convertible bond is?  What is the difference between options on equities versus options on commodities?
Tell me about volatility, beta, intrinsic value, extrinsic value.
So you know more than me.  Shoot, answer any one of those questions and we will start our conversation there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:51:17
Great!  I have no argument with that.
It's also in a huge bubble driven by people who know nothing about financial markets at all.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:46:19
I think it is on a bubble built by people buying it just on speculation that it will go up.  I do not think it is acting as a currency.
It does have value in black market and dark web transactions.  But I'm pretty positive that the seller trades out of their bitcoin within seconds of receiving payment.
My job wasn't to know one market.  My job was to know every market.  Every trading strategy.  Well at least in Commodities and Equities.  But I do understand swaps and debt.
I did invest some time in understanding the whole bitcoin trading environment.
If someone hacks blockchain, the whole thing comes to an end.  And your investment is worth a penny for every dollar if you are lucky.
Every other market has Exchanges, and Clearing Houses.
I'm not saying this technology shouldn't exist.  I'm just saying one does not invest in currency.  You can trade currency spreads.  But you don't invest in it.
But bitcoin fans think it is the new gold.  The big difference with gold is you can hold it.  It goes in your safe at your home.
So it should not be invested in like a stock, or a debt product, or precious metal, or even any type of commodity.  
But that is how it is referred to by bitcoin people.  That is why professionals don't go near it.
It's like Beanie Babies.  People got all excited and started investing in them, and collecting them.  What are they worth now?  A $1?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:42:09
There is not a whole lot of education behind that argument.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:18:20
They are part of the F/X world.  Due to the amount of trading I had to do, I needed to know that shit like the back of my hand.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:21:40
You have some interesting comments.  I graduated with my undergrad in BS Electrical Engineering.  
Then I became a market movement analyst.  Then I became an algorithmic trader on very large volumes.  
I received my Masters in Computer Science in 2016.  There is nothing vintage about that.
You keep calling me vintage.  Is that because I have experience?
That makes me think you are a punk kid who doesn't respect your elders' knowledge and experience.  You sound like every other idiot who destroyed all of their assets or worse, destroyed all of their family's assets on bullshit hype.
That doesn't effect me.  You will learn to respect experience.  You will after you lose your shirt a few times.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:17:13
As long as you realize you are gambling.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:39:47
Should I go get a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a Masters in Computer Science?  Would that help me understand?  Then spend over a decade in finance?
Would those things help me not be an 'oldie any more'?  
Oh wait, I would have had to have JUST graduated with my Masters to not be considered an 'Oldie'.  Like last year or something.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:05:25
You can look up many of those things.  Why don't you.
I'm not angry.  
I was making a point to another person, then you chimed in with a childish comment.  So I called you out.
Again, Take the challenge or keep your mouth shut.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:53:47
I never argued the concept of using technology to move money.  I'm all for that.
I'm saying it's a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:33:07
You called me a teenager and said I never did any of the things I did.
You claimed I did not have huge experience in the financial markets.
Therefore, you need to back it up.  
You were just talking shit.  That's all you are, a shit talker.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:47:51
Nope, it's a free market.  And it represents something physical.  100 Shares of some stock may only end up being worth a few office chairs, a stapler, and half a xerox machine.  But there is something real.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:26:57
Agreed, sorry if I was being a dick.  I pushed it too far.
I'm not saying this isn't a useful product.  
I'm saying it is the most insane bubble I've ever seen.  And anyone who pays over $6k for one this year is not making a smart decision.
What if I design my own version of bitcoin.  What happens to the market then?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:05:35
It's a commodity.  A commodity.  It has a value.  It is also over priced.
But it isn't 16 times it's value in one year based on nothing.  That is a bubble.
What changed since January?  Was the world safe and at peace last December?  
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:22:56
I would agree, it is hard to say where the curve actually becomes a bubble.
That is why I'm saying it was 6 months ago.  It was hard for me to get all of that experience and my degrees.  Not easy.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:33:12
So let's say you sell your car for a good price.  Do you then take that money to the casino?
That is what you are suggesting.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:28:01
Do you think you'll be able to afford a computer by then?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:53
Ahhh, the cry of the idiot.  Just insult me and avoid the topic.
