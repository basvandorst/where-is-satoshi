What the community needs is a statement from DHS so we know the timeline and scope of the freeze.
We can expect the party line is "we can't comment on an ongoing investigation", but when you think about it, that is to avoid signalling to criminals about the investigation.
A seizure is a pretty big and obvious signal. Does anyone familiar with financial industry / law enforcement happen to know how long a seizure typically lasts?  Do they usually seize near the end of an investigation?
If DHS drags its feet, maybe any US citizens here could throw together a FOIA request and publish the response.

That's not the same as "bend over and take it". In fact, that quote sums up bitcoin's main conceptual value.
The unaddressed challenge is what to do when you set up your own shit and then the bully toddler comes over to wreck it out of jealousy.

It mostly does not matter, although there is one difference. If you use Tor and access a tor2web address, the connections look like this:
you+Tor &lt;-&gt; {magic cyber cloud} &lt;-&gt; tor2web &lt;-&gt; {magic cyber cloud} &lt;-&gt; hidden service
If you use a .onion directly, it looks like this:
you+Tor &lt;-&gt; {magic cyber cloud} &lt;-&gt; internal Tor rendezvous &lt;-&gt; {magic cyber cloud} &lt;-&gt; hidden service
I think the difference is that the tor2web proxy knows that "someone using Tor is visiting that specific .onion" but the rendezvous server only knows that "someone using Tor is visiting *some* .onion".
In other words, in the second case, the proxy doesn't even know the .onion address.
This could be important. The tor2web site could track the pattern of access times for different hidden services to build profiles for those services.

To all the "at least they are trying" arguments, or those who aren't familiar with computer transactions, here's an analogy:
Imagine you walk into your local bank to apply for an account and while you are waiting to see the representative, you overhear them on the phone:
"-yeah, sometimes I get confused about my account books and the numbers don't add up right… what's that? double entry book keeping? ok, maybe I should try that."
Now it's great you support this *business* in their learning endeavors, but do you really want to move your savings into this institution?

What is the purpose of encrypting multiple times with aes-256-cbc?
A cryptographic cipher is either broken or not, right?  Running a broken cipher multiple times is still broken; a strong cipher multiple times, is no more strong than a single time.  Right?
Am I missing some crazy crypto conjecture?

Ripple's integration of IOU's, trust paths, and cross currency transactions is brilliant. I am concerned about the consensus protocol, though.
The wiki details seem too hand-wavy. Do they assume all ledger processors are in a fully connected broadcast network? If there are disjoint, overlapping networks, how do they claim to quickly reach consensus?
I suspect if they haven't been careful enough on their assumptions about consensus, network-wide DOS will be feasible. If they made the trade-off the other way, then partitions may be possible and temporary double spends.

**Anonymity PSA**: If you visit that link (assuming you are not using Tor), your IP address will potentially be recorded by various intermediate parties. Later, when you sign up, these same parties may correlate your unprotected visit with your future activity.
If you plan on using this service anonymously, *do not* use the tor2web link. Instead, install a [Tor]( tool and open the [ address directly. Both TorBrowser and TAILS have a great balance of security versus ease of use.  (Setting up Tor directly with your web browser or OS is difficult and error prone.)
Have a nice day!

What exactly do you mean "provably secure"?  How can someone prove to you that they created a sequence of bits (the secret key), gave a copy to you (in a device), but they no longer "have" those bits?

I think you misunderstood me, or I was not clear. It's certainly dumb to use tor2web without using Tor to do anything that requires anonymity.
My point was slightly different: If you use tor2web to set up the perfect shopping cart full of child porn, cocaine, guns, pirated Game of Thrones episodes, and then you later use Tor to go back to the site and make a purchase, I hope it's obvious a correlation can be made.
So if you ever click a tor2web link and you are *not using Tor*, and you think "oh, this is awesome, I'll have to come back to this site with Tor*, that should be a red flag.

If an attacker finds an XSS vulnerability, why would they bother with passwords at all?  Instead, just have the attack script transfer out all BTC.

For two businesses offering the same service or product, one "aboveground" and the other anonymous, there are some tradeoffs:
* Maybe the aboveground business is subject to more regulation, so its service costs more. Maybe the anonymous business is subject to more rip-off attempts and has less law enforcement protection.
* Maybe the anonymous business is operated in a political climate where if its operation were known, the owner and their family would not be safe or would have to pay very costly bribes.
* Maybe the legality of the service is not known so the owner makes an estimated risk trade-off: they believe it is cheaper to operate anonymously with those risks than to operate above ground where there are legal costs for research, registration, licensing, etc...
This last issue is important, I believe. If a tiny operation starts aboveground in any kind of disruptive market, it is easy for big players to wipe it out. Anonymous business allows the small guy to get a start in an even playing field.
*Disclaimer*: The owner of this account does not operate any anonymous business concerns, citing their own risk calculation given their situation and legal jurisdiction.

When you use your bank's website, you trust the bank wholly to act on your behalf.  *That* use case could simply, dumbly, send every key stroke to the bank server over properly authenticated SSL and would have the same security properties.
In *contrast* to that banking use case, it is possible to have a JavaScript application which runs in your browser, such that *so long as* you are justified in trusting the JavaScript code, you *may justifiably lack* any trust in the server.
**Importantly**, sending *either* a password, or a password hash, to a server is trusting the server to make some authorization decision based on that, and therefore the application trusts the server for whatever the password is for.
I'm not familiar with any of the web wallet implementations.  I can see a design which trusts the server to store encrypted bitcoin secret keys, and only to give those encrypted keys to clients which provide the correct password (or password hash), and then the client could use a separate key to decrypt the bitcoin keys locally.
The server would never need to see this separate encryption key, and therefore the user would not need to trust the server with the bitcoin keys.
Of course, this assumes the user *can* trust the JavaScript code...  if it's normal website javascript, then we're back to trusting the server; if it's a third party website javascript or an extension, etc... now we have different, and useful, trust models.

It's common and common sense that if you are gathering evidence prior to making a formal charge, you don't want to tip off the (soon-to-be) accused.  If you do, then they shred their paper trails.
That's the justification anyway. Another reason is probably because it takes work to do public announcements, and there's not enough time/resources/priority.
The time to do public announcements is right after you file charges or win a case, or do something else where you can say: "See, we're kicking ass here, so vote for the incumbent!"
