Heck yeah ;)

Thanks for replying! I really like your paper designs :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 06:21:24
Yeah, we would only start a company that did not ever want or need to touch fiat, and we would only start that company outside the US... glad we did.
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:50:10
Heck yeah!

Actually, we're working on some announcements to that effect as we speak! Check out Tapeke.com :)

Killer job, Quinn!

This gets me pretty excited. Start building your bitcoin apps, kids! I can't wait to see what you guys at Block.io do next...
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:08:16
I can't wait!

This is not only a great idea, but a delightful read. I always think the redditors who do these campaigns are missing something in the area of coordination and follow thru.
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:49:57
This is really cool! Little determination, lotta hard work ;)
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:36:08
Awesome! Can't wait to try it :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:36:02
We are about 8 weeks from beta. Did you sign up? We'd love to have you among our trial group. Your feedback is much appreciated both now and up until we debut our app. Thx :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:35:40
Well, you can't count us in the mix. Bootstrapping with BTC...exclusively :) 
There's no other way we'd consider it. I wish more bitcoin-related startups would conceive of their business model in such a way that they do not need to interface with fiat. The future can't get here soon enough!
Check us out and join our beta list at 
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:44:58
Yeah, please do reach out if you're interested in a beta invitation!
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:06:03
But what about paying for a subscription using Bitcoin? We would like to use their enterprise solution. We refuse to touch DropBox.
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:19:14
Thanks, Lizz!
We love your work too ;)
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:41:08
Oh, I bet it's way more than 40%... Even on the coasts...

1 hug for you, TBI. @_date: 2014-08-25 21:07:08
This is pretty huge. Ver is a beast.

This is one of the main features we're creating in the crypto personal finance app we're building! I'm encouraged to see that this is something so many bitcoiners are interested in. Please check us out at Tapeke.com, and sign up for our beta trial list to stay in touch and get great early-adopter specials when we launch!
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:58:25
This is great! And you're the one for it, Curtis. Bitcoin Bigfoot proves that. I would love to see some charities get calls from you who have yet to begin accepting bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:26:25
Weird he calls it unsustainable. It's the most sustainable money "system" the world has ever known... but I'm preaching to the choir ;)

Multi-Sig is so important. We can kill a lot of FUD with widespread use of M-of-N transactions.
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:36:15
We are so glad you like it! Design and security and privacy are our guiding forces :D

I am watching this post in real-time get downvoted to hell. Who hates Airbitz this much? There is a frigging brigade of haters going after this post. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:20:17
How is this comment downvoted?
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:50:09
I love it! When I find a place that is no longer accepting bitcoin I just email info and tell them. I know there was talk of them crowdsourcing directory data. I talked to the CEO at a conference not long ago and he said they source info form all the other directories out there and also manually verify and update the info themselves. Sad to hear there are businesses who no longer accept bitcoin but once did. Where are you approximately located ? Sounds like the meetup community in your area needs to get their up outreach game and/or patronize the BTC accepting businesses by you. Just a tip. Just see how it feels ;)
@_date: 2015-03-11 01:19:42
try  ;)
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:12:35
So are you guys. Love all the awesome Airbitz announcements lately! (highfive)
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:26:49
Ah yes, I recall now.

What was the ponzi among the sponsors of the Amsterdam conference?
