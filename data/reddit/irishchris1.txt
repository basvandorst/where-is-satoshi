It costs to move btc to a wallet... holding at exchange (at least small amounts) can save some money if you plan to sell soon.

Susssh it’s guys like this that make us all money

This is a US thing.. I'm New Zealand we very rarely use cash. Paywave everywhere, use your mobile or card to pay contactless.
I like Bitcoin because going overseas is a hassle.. but I won't pretend that btc doesn't have a long way to go to be as hassle free as paying in my home currency.

I’m an outsider. Never bought bitcoin, and I just don’t get it. What are you investing in that gets that high rate of return? There’s no company behind it with assets like buildings, or a healthy p&amp;l.. it’s just other people buying to get a return? That’s baseless speculation right?
Oh and from what I’ve read this is actually meant to be a currency.. so speculation to make real money gains actually further undermines any legitimacy? Shits fucked yo

Sounds like it. I fail to see how people buying bitcoin for the sole reason of selling it a a higher price in dollars builds a currency? 
That’s speculation, and it only works until the music stops and some poor sap is left holding a rotten egg. Now if I look at subs like this, it looks to me that it’s full of people trying to blast music as loud as possible so that they can pass the parcel to the next smuck in the line (HODL, ‘we’re in a dip’, ‘black Friday sale!’ Etc.)
What’s funny however is that unlike rotten companies, there is literally no real assets to provide a floor for value. I find this the most shocking point, as it seems people are speculating based on observations of real stocks (dips, swings, estimated floor) which predicts human investment behaviour but completely ignores that unlike companies this asset has no real value, it’s value is ‘collective belief’ (like real currency) and therefore fundamentally zero if people stop believing

Sounds like sunk cost fallacy. My advice is to limit your risk. Keep your money in on those positions, and use the remaining on some fixed term deposits

Sounds like you are all in. If it's any compensation, stocks are all trading down today massively so could be a larger market correction.. hopefully btc can buck the trend.

Yea... I was thinking of investing in BTC untill I thought about this pretty hard. No doupt people are making money here, but its from selling to other people buying in, rather than through organic point of sale transaction &amp; inflation

I guess the difference is the blockchain technology, which seems to only draw comparisons with the birth of the internet itself... i.e. decentralised network. My fear is that I miss out on a unique opportunity to invest in this growth, but I understand the risk is that the technology itself is not actually tied to bitcoin, and that could be seen later as a mere proof of concept

Risk/Reward.. for everyone who has made a 10 fold return on btc, im sure there's 10 people who have made a loss on other coins.
