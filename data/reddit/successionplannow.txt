The work on planned responses can start now.

One Scenario: if there was more than 10% of employed adults taking full salaries in Bitcoin, the US would try to legislate that away by making that illegal.

You aren't alone.  The scaling plan of 8x doesn't work long-term.  It is all very short sighted.
Not hard to imagine your favorite alt doubling tomorrow.
BCH is about to run out of steem.  Cause tons of BTC holders either will go down with the ship or won't buy BCH.

Feels hard to justify to the masses.  War?  Because they are offended and inconvenienced?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:12:09
Uh...I think Amazon, Google, Facebook...and every adult...would lock arms instantly to shut down (and possibly violently oppose) any discussion of this.

A market cap in the trillions would be on the order of dot-com sized.  If the narrative is that it was a bubble, I could see fiscal policy ir regulations attempting to surpress or talk down the price.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:19:13
Agreed; but that won't work for normies.

Is that so simple?  They would lose the ability to identify who is doing what with bitcoin.  It doesn't stop peer to peer.

OP, why do you think the volatility will persist as market cap climbs?  I bet at $1T,  Bitcoin will be much less volatile.  I can't believe $1T is only 5x away.

If transaction speeds improved, and started to steal material marketshare from a MC or Visa, I could see a consumer protection narrative lobby group forming in favour of the status quo.

Fair point.  I guess I was looking for people to post scenarios.  Then others to post theoretical responses as foĺlow up.  Let me try to get the ball rolling with a top level reply to my own post.

Likely, this is the market's response to the lack of options.

Dozens go through per week.  Odds are very, very, low of it working.  More likely, your tx gets booted from the mempool and your wallet is confused.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:47:08
Are you okay?
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:08:38
Or a liquidity program.

Can we think of something more creative?  Personally, I'd rather fight corruption with sunlight.  What is the first step?  Do you need a guy to put a website up?  I could do that.  What would it say?  Are we looking for donations?  Is there a law firm lined up?

BCH will likely stabilize with lower fees than BTC.  Until lightening. 
That said, I had 10 transactions in btc in the last two weeks confirm in under 72 hours.  8 under 48h.  Zero fees.  Inputs == outputs.

I believe we should fund "the great crypto movie"; and have it ready for the  next bull market run.  Make it a covert educational/propaganda piece.

Because if they charge a different price, that would make for an arbitrage opportunity.  Best case, they could charge the same price they always do, less the processing fees that a Mastercard or visa would take.  But, I think the Terms of Service for MC and Visa prohibit this behaviour.
