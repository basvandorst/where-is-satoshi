I posted this on hashtalk ( perhaps it helps-
GAW/Investors are holding about 97% of all XPY (
Available supply in total at the moment are: 12,325,898 XPY
The community has 3% thats: 369,776 XPY around the whole market
3.1. A majority of this is locked up in HashStakers so think of 1-2% which are really on the open market: 246,517 XPY
We know GAW has reserve, which they wanted to pump the price to 20$
4.1. it was about 100mio$. But only 1/3 of it was expected to be used to establish the floor
4.2. This makes it about 30mio$ to be used to establish 20$
4.3. GAW said they burned 500k$ in a minute. We saw on cryptsy a volume of 25k XPY were bought up from 0.04 to 0.065
4.4. this "buy" lasted not longer than 10minutes.
4.5. So lets take it from 3.1. we have 246,517 XPY at 20$ that would make 4,930,340 $. to buy up ALL XPY on the market at price of 20$.
So if GAW really would have had these reserve, they could buy up the entire "free runinng XPY on the market" 4 times at 20$.
Going to Paybase, the limit was 700$ to sell XPY.
6.1. 700$/20$ = about 35 XPY. So about 714 people selling at 20$+ 35XPY directly/minute. That would have been 25k XPY a minute. (wait 25k? see volume on 4.3.?). As it lasted only 10minutes it would have burn 5mio$ or 250,000 XPY.
6.2. So 250,000 XPY gone into GAW hands for BTC, but on the free market there are only 246,517 XPY available?
make your own conclusion out of this... for me its clear, GAW has defintly not burned any reserve, they pumped cryptsy with 500k$ and then let the market do what he has done now.
