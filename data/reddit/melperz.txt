A lot of the online groups I've been in have recently adopted spending/transferring their BCH as mode of payments due to its fast confirmation and low fee so it's probably starting to catch on the masses.

I'm going to be honest that I don't really understand those technicals. I'm just saying from my experiences that my $5 bcash transaction confirmed in just a few minutes, compared to the $45 btc i sent to my brother that took more than a day, although I only set it to the lowest fee (i'm not rich) but i want my coins to be used to what they were intended for.

Oh ok i think i understand the potential problem now. Thank you.

I saw it mentioned in this sub before but totally forgot about it. What's the subreddit dedicated to setting up a mining rig? Something like @_date: 2017-12-07 05:31:19

Probably publicity gaining traction due to FOMO of upcoming hard forks and launching of futures in NASDAQ.  
Or perhaps the Big Bang Theory watchers were recently got verified from their accounts ��

Wouldn't it be a big problem in the future? Say majority of the US fully adopted the btc payment system. Isn't it counterintuitive to track all your expenses using btc (cup of coffee, gas, meal, groceries, etc.) just to pay taxes for it?

Is it good/bad to the ff?  
1. Btc holders  
2. Btc miners  
3. Establishments that accepts btc  
4. Other alts

What if you bought btc for the sole purpose of using it as payment for restaurants, utilities, etc. Basically you didn't sell it right?
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:58:10
Get fucked in the ass.

Fun money! Now I get why we're on this rollercoaster.
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:59:58
That's where I'm confused how it is treated as income. Is it any different from converting your  US Dollar to say, European Pounds and just holding it for a while?

Kick yourself back now to show your previous self he shouldn't be kicking you in the first place.

That's a blessing man! Embrace everything you have.

How about if you used those bitcoin directly in paying bills, is it still considered selling and you have to pay taxes against it?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:24:50
Did you find your long forgotten hard drive with 250 bitcoins under the bed too?
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:45:03
I may only be holding negligible btc amount, but I can say I sold right after the announcement of S2X cancellation since I predicted it to be going down right away. Glad I did since I need some funds for somethig. Then I set the buy price at the 10% above its previous price before it kicked to ATH last week which luckily for me was along the range of the lowest so now I ended up with some profit and higher amount of BTC.  
I can say I protected my profit rather than hold.

I only follow btc. Eli5?
