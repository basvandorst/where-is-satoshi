Don't bother. You know this sub will downvote anything critical of Bitcoin to oblivion.

Another thread about this on the mainpage? The last 2 years people kept telling me this was not a problem whatsoever. Bitcoin has no problems or flaws. Also sidechains! would fix everything. Not that there was something to fix in the first place of course. 
So yeah, kinda odd to see thread after thread about this non existing problem.

Don't you people ever get tired of this moon crap? For years you've been doing this. Every single week the tothemoonguy is needed for something else. 
Don't you ever learn from the past?

Because none of the companies that get praised here all the time actually give a shit about Bitcoin. 
They only use Bitcoin to empty the pockets of Bitcoiners. They just want their dirty slave fiat dollars. 
Amazing how you people still don't realize this. Truly amazing. 
Yes keep on downvoting. It makes it less true. Downvote reality away!

Not too good. 
Theft, scams, companies dropping Bitcoin, Bitcoiners holding and expecting others to spend and so on. The only place where Bitcoins get actively spent are darknet markets. 
If you have to believe this sub then mainstream adoption is around the corner. But in reality the rest of the world outside this sub (7 billion people) don't give a shit about Bitcoin. 
Random relevant quote which i read today which shows how Bitcoiners roll:
"But Mr Boughuettaya said he was surprised at the number of emails he received when the software developers temporarily removed the bitcoin option to install updates.
We received about 30 emails from people asking for it to be reinstalled which is odd because that's more people than have actually used the feature, he said."
Edit - And downvoted in seconds of course. Because we all know the only reply allowed here is "to the moon!"
Feel free to man up and besides rage downvoting me also tell me where i'm wrong.
