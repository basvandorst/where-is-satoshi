No, a truly libertarian level free market means actions such as robbery, theft, embezzlement, and fraud violate the rights of others, so government control of these actions is legitimate. Libertarians acknowledge human imperfection and the resulting need for some government deterrence and punishment of violence, nuisance, and harassment. However, government control of human activity should be limited to these functions.
On the one hand, government intervention is working as it should in order to bring people like Marc Karpeles to justice. On the other hand, government market manipulation at the hand of the Federal Reserve, and the lack of justice against money launderers such as HSBC, has compelled us to create and use a free-market cryptocurrency. 
What you are describing is anarchism, and is decidedly less libertarian than it was 18 months ago. Most of the manipulation complaints are coming from people who think government mandated manipulation at the hands of crony socialists is somehow better than the bitcoin system. By using charges of "market manipulation," the political elite and their allies are planting the seeds for an agenda of a government monopoly on the very manipulation they promise to eliminate.

I think is using bits because shibes are used to dealing in larger amounts of a full unit instead of fractions. In fact, one of the reasons dogecoin was promoted was because it was (erroneously) assumed that people would be less open to the idea of dealing in fractions of a bitcoin.

But this helps solve one of the "problems" people complain about bitcoin, that only the early adopters benefited. This will help circulate the coin to more people, right?

Bitcoin: 6 blocks per hour multiplied by 4 years equals 210,240 blocks. 210,240 blocks multiplied by the block rewards which halve every four years [50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + ...] = 21 million bitcoins.
Doge: No cap whatsoever. Such inflation. Wow. So Shibe. Much Pump and Dump. Many brigades. (somebody please shoot me)
They are not the same goddamned thing you idiot.

Assuming you already have a 401K or other retirement savings account (and no, social security is not a viable replacement for a personal retirement account) Sound investment advice would be to invest no more than 10% of your net worth. As your net worth increases and bitcoin becomes more than 10%, you should diversify it into things like stocks, bonds, etc...

Well, stop posting live links to phishing sites, stop asking us to call the scammers who are running these sites directly so that they (or you) can mine our phone numbers with your help, and do something other than complain about phishing sites like you have been since your account was created 5 months ago claiming somehow their existence will hurt bitcoin. Phishing sites exist for every currency in the world. If anything, the fact that criminals want it so badly legitimizes it in a way.

Fuck slashdot. I haven't been back to slashdot since I read the Satoshi whitepaper in February 2013, and realized how much fucking misinformation was in that fucking slashdot article all those years before when I first shrugged bitcoin off. 
First of all, they (slashdot) were supposed to be a reliable source of news for new technology, secondly, they helped convince me to miss out on a great opportunity.

I think from here on out, new coins will be made in faster and faster rates. Perhaps the inventor of the coin may see a small return, but over time the market will stop responding to these pump and dumps and creation will be strictly for the lulz since the ROI will likely dip below what the alt coin creator could make doing other things with his/her/their time.
Hard to guess what the next popular one will be. HammockBearCoin?

Exactly. I am tired of seeing people demand the US government to do something about Mt Gox. We are already doing something. We don't need the attention of the regulators just yet. We only want their attention when it is too late for them to do anything about us and they realize they are out of a job.
This is a free market currency. As a free market currency YOU have the power over your own money, not anyone else. As we all know it is a great power, and with great power, comes great responsibility.
Keep your bitcoins in a cold wallet. I have no sympathy for daytraders QQing over losing 80% of their net worth on a site like Mt. Gox. It is fucking retarded to keep any significant amount of wealth in a day trade exchange site. That's like keeping your retirement fund tied up on a craps table. Fucking. Stupid.
Regulation saves idiots from themselves, and you know what that does? creates more idiots. Free market, like evolution, paves the way for smarter, more robust actors in the economy. It self-regulates itself by culling out the stupidity that would otherwise be allowed to thrive in a controlled market far longer than it should have, which causes more damage in the long run.
If you don't like it, go use some regulated government-infested cryptocurrency, keep bitcoin free (as in speech).

No, the REAL early adopters, the ones who like the currency for what it is, weren't trying to cash out on Mt. Gox Most of them are holding onto them to use in trade for goods and services, not to sell for useless fiat.

Looking at your post history, I am really starting to think my initial gut feeling about you was right.
Tin foil hat: creates phishing sites. In order to generate more search engine traffic, he posts links to the site here, and on other forums so that web crawlers are more likely to boost his phishing site search results.
Tin foil hat 2: thinks that the existence of phishing sites, somehow lessens the value of bitcoin.

Buying oxy for $60 back when bitcoin was in the $30 range just as a proof of concept. The person I was showing this to didn't believe it was possible.
