Found out about BTC when I went into Silk Road for the first time in 2013. Didn't know what I had stumbled upon and completely forgot about it until July 2017, around the release of Game of Thrones season 7. My friends were talking about building computers and my favorite tech Youtubers were talking about Ethereum and Bitcoin mining so I made a comment on how so many people are buying up GPUs for Bitcoin mining. I happened to check the price and it had dipped to $1800 and I thought "wow, this thing crashed who would buy this". 
The next day, I had checked the price of BTC and it had gone back up to around $2200. That afternoon, I was listening to a podcast driving home and the people in it said "Listen guys, if you want to do something in your life now that could change your future forever, buy ONE Bitcoin. Just buy one and thank me later." 
That same day I decided to actually read up on it and right then and there I was convinced. Only having around $3k savings, I took a huge chance and bought a whole BTC at $2200 cause I love me some round numbers and now I'm here with you guys. Glad I did it and never looked back.

If you are purchasing with USD, Coinbase is awesome. Once u get more into it, Gemini has less fees. Thats what I use for now.

It goes by amount on Coinbase. They start with a $1.99 fee for any purchase &lt; or = to $51.99. $2.99 for anything &lt; or = to $201.99 and variable past that.
