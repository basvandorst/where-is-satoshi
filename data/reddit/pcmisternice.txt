Wonder how many paperweights have been made in the name of bitcoin mining.

Dear MtGox Customers, we apologize for the inconvenience caused by the recent deletion of our Tweet history. Fortunately, we are preparing to announce a new Tweeting solution to be implemented... soon... Thank you again for using the world's most sophisticated trading platform and we look forward to resume Tweeting as quickly as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:57:56
Um, no. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:32:02
Did you have a point?
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:33:40
I hope the kid gets his hoverboard. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:29:02
I won't be the first to suggest that he do the Honorable Thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:48:23
I don't leave gold coins at the end of my driveway either. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:40:36
Gox may not go belly up, but I have a suspicion some executives may end up in prison in short order. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:38:50
I'm not buying at the moment, I'm content to wait and see where the price settles. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:23:20
I don't like Seagate either. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:28:33
it's up 700% in a year. That kind of return usually takes a decade. Or longer. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:23:20
This is the kind of in-depth analysis that brings the world to this sub. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:59:21
The bubble from last year is still deflating. It could be several months before it hits bottom. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:37:16
Oh, it was received...
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:11:40
What nation would issue it as legal tender?
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:26:41
If you're clever you can get away with "ignoring" the IRS. I doubt you are. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:43:23
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:26:04
If you use a spinning hard drive the bitcoins might fly off the edge. Stick with SSDs. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:24:25
Well there was 3:54 I didn't waste watching that. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:57:24
Please don't post Krugman in places where we're trying to find useful information. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:32:18
For the most part, governments of the world want bitcoin to go away, and I'm more than happy with their lack of involvement. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:39:44
That's an interesting question. I've heard Bulgaria but no one knows where they are. I have a lot of money on there that I'm sure will go the way of Gox shortly.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:37:24
To trade with. I don't have more on there than I can afford to lose, nor do I think they're a scam. Hopefully that sentiment won't change. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:14:53
Well we know what that conference is going to be about. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:46:49
Unless you're going long, really long, you should've shorted from $1000 a long time ago. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:06:57
On the bright side, it's easier to trade against stoners than banks. Sometimes. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:06:10
This is awesome. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:40:57
All you need to make money is volatility. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:31:11
Can't believe there's anything to acquire from Gox but insolvency and angst. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:14:29
This is exactly it. No one would buy Gox until after bankruptcy and the debts are discharged. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:38:12
For example, if you want to know what an "RSI Indicator" is, you can Google "RSI Indicator". 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:31:29
Alrighty. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:42:01
Fontastic. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:16:18
I don't know bro, if only someone made a sub where people could post bitcoin news, maybe together would could find out what's going on. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:42:26
Two hour trading lag that they never fixed. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:05:02
I hear OKCoin does a high volume of LTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:17:24
Not usually for things being "banned", but if Krugman links were banned from this sub it wouldn't bother me. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:22:38
I just sent them all the bitcoin I have left for attorney fees. Hopefully they can get my Goxcoin back. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:15:59
These motivational posts always confuse me. If you like bitcoin, why would you not want to have more for less?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:50:47
I'll admit I didn't read the whole thing since it started out so epicly stupid, but I'm surprised they would post such ill-informed trash. Hire people willing to do research, Forbes. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:36:40
I've lost my ass in this game time and time again, but I still seem to come out ahead at the end of the day, or usually week sometimes month, but the point is... you'll get there again. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:23:03
Davidpate said he needed the coin to buy machinery. Whatever the hell that means. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:11:12
Use [this]( You'll need the tools to mine scrypt. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:07:20
Yes, they went under because they were poorly ran. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:19:52
What "should" happen rarely does. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:54:50
Eventually these people will be buying in, and your bitcoin will be worth even more. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:27:09
DON'T DO THIS! The bitcoin.exe on my hard drive was full of viruses and I got very sick and diarrhead. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:26:56
Never heard of that site. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:33:09
They didn't say who stole the 750K bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:44:50
Yeah, me too. Bitcoin has been awesome and made me a lot of money. It will continue being fun and making people wealthy for a long time. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:20:48
It goes up, it goes down.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:21:47
I'm gonna grab a beer. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:47:57
So I didn't get a good price buying Goxcoin at 0.19?
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:54:38
Poverty and gambling, some of time's oldest friends. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:40:47
Just because they're too stupid and lazy to delete everything doesn't mean  they're going to be back in five minutes. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:04:13
Do you even read this sub?
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:12:36
I did not know that currencies and commodities could be volatile. Valuable insight from the Alabama Securities Commission. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:25:52
Never put all of your coin in one place, regardless of where. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:58:13
That thumbnail had me confused for a second. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:29:55
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:16:29
[This]( has some decent information on the mechanics and application. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:05:59
That looks nice, but I've found that no matter how much air you try to squeeze between the cards, if there's only one slot space between them they run much hotter than if there's 2.5" using risers. The radiant heat from the back of one card heats the card next to it. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:41:17
Internet. It's not new. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:31:37
Think of it as a... new beginning. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 01:51:35
If only they made a way you could store bitcoin offline instead of on another's server. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:56:28
Just Google the name. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:19:43
Gox was dead a few days ago, it's just as dead now. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:33:53
Sorry dude, "Please give it back" usually isn't a workable way to resolve theft. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:27:47
They're not cheap coins if they cost less tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:31:50
Some people have issues, some don't. I've taken quite a bit of money out of there, I think a lot of times failure to withdraw amounts to temporary issues or user error. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:17:46
A lot of the wealthy gave up their riches to help Madoff's victims, so I don't see why this shouldn't happen. At least, I think they did. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:27:23
People sold into that 1466btc wall at 15:17 just because it was there, then the price went up. Idiots. It's like dangling a shiny object in front a child. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:48:07
Everyone keeps saying it's already deflated. Yet it's falling. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:41:29
Hell no. Not for years at least. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:29:02
"Join CNET to vote on this poll". Not likely. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:27:01
How is this a bash on crypto? Large scale, seemingly legitimate organizations are now using bitcoin to rip people off. This is something that's usually limited to securities, real estate, etc. BTC has officially gone mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:51:59
I'm sure he'll come up with this idea on his own in short order. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:38:28
Maybe try some mutual funds. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:09:07
Depth of field. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:45:24
I don't have exact numbers for any of these questions. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:45:45
You'd think a "megafund" would know better than to buy near the top of a bubble. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:03:10
If the BTCs are geniunely lost = fewer BTCs, the remaining ones become more valuable. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:36:48
What if the leash slips out of your hand. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:36:41
Dude I hope to get you some answers soon. Stay tuned to this channel. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:51:34
It's pretty common for the executives to tell the staff when their company is going to go belly up, because that really improves office stability. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:39:57
Good to see Gox Support representing on Reddit. Can I have some BTCs for 1/3 price to dump on Stamp? I'll kick back 15% on top. Hopefully we can come up with a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:09:48
This doesn't say why customers will never get their money out of Gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:15:41
Number of people who'd put money/coin on Gox:
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:53:17
It's still deflating from November. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:05:32
Give the people what they want.
