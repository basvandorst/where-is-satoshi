Anyone who knows the basics of supply and demand, along with liquidity. Should know that stability at this level of market cap (liquidity), is a sign of decay.
Looking at the charts it would appear that 2014 was the most stable year for Bitcoin as far as day to day average price change, and it is slowly being "walked down" as 2014 appears to be the first year of steady bitcoin decline.

It is not ever possible without totally centralizing bitcoin.  Others like Peter Todd have done full power point presentations about how it is mathematically impossible to scale bitcoin by increasing the blocksize without destroying the solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem.
The fact that you (and many in the pro-blocksize bloat) continue to dodge the laws of math, physics, and logic indicates a deceptive agenda.
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:52:30
Assuming an increase in the blocksize limit is a forgone conclusion, we still need to come to a consensus to avoid a "hard fork war".
What do you think of instead of a hard-coded limit, that we have a POS (proof of stake) vote that adds up every (2016) blocks the blocksize is adjusted up or down at the same time as difficulty.
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:25:17
While I agree with you and I am firmly in the "Peter Todd camp", it is becoming clear from watch the pattern of the vote brigading that this and people like OP are part of a very sophisticated shill-op to centralize the control of bitcoin

I know anyone can release a fork of the code and convince the miners and nodes to switch.
My issue is that a core dev that is respected by the community, going around the other core devs that have raised valid points about raising the blocksize limit too high and /or fast indicates a serious unprofessional.

I can't prove it, but I believe there is some real funding coming from those who want to centralize Bitcoin.  This is one form of attack that is more cost effective than spending billions of hardware for a 51% attack (talked about extensively on this sub before as a real possible threat).

I'm not saying the government after buying some closed source software should be able to turn around and make the vendor open the source.  
That would be an infringement on trade secrets.
I am saying that the government does not have a right to use my tax dollars to buy closed source software and no vendor has a right to a contract with the government.
A contract is a voluntary thing on both sides by definition.  The government is suppose to represent the people.  The people by agent of their representatives insisting that they negotiate all contracts with vendors to require the source code be open does not violate the right of the vendor because the vendor is free not to enter into such a contract.

"The purpose of that process is to prove to any doubters that they'd better
start supporting bigger blocks or they'll be left behind,"
 There is a well operating attack in bitcoin.
In one area it appears to be a successful attempt to cause division within the bitcoin community. Such a thing is needed for a hard fork war. A hard fork war will make it much more cost efficient for an outside entity to perform a 51% hash attack.

Destroying the loyalty among family and friends was one of the reasons for government social security.
It also had undermined the concept of the older generations teaching the grandchildren stewardship over resources. 
In the west, thanks to social security among other things, elderly went from being revered for their wisdom and experience to narcissistic and are allowed to rot in nursing homes.

"Aug. 11, 2010: Imagine someone stole something from you. You can’t get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it? Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it’ll be useless to them, although you still lose it too? If they give it back, you can re-activate it. Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen. If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again. (With bitcoin), the money is never truly burned. You have the option to release it at any time forever."  - Satoshi Nakamoto
