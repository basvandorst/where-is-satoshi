Would it be worth getting a loan to buy one now before it goes over $20000. A loan I could easily pay without effecting my life too much and I’m willing to lose it all if it doesn’t pan out?

More like,
Hey Bro, I see you’re about to burn $38 million to ash, 
mind if I have $5600 of that? 
Instead of destroying that fraction along with the rest you’re about to waste?
Also, a joke

I’m just so pissed off I brought about 1.03 Bitcoins hours  before the dip. For the same amount of money I could’ve got 1.4 . Fuck I’m annoyed. It’ll probably go back up again before I can get more lol

Yeah lol. I was joking around anyway. I was asking the kind of person who would destroy that many Bitcoins to send me that little amount in comparison, instead of vaporing it into a nothing.

Ah ok. I wasn’t sure lol. I thought people were taking me seriously. I just couldn’t believe someone would destroy that many. Here I am worried about .04 of a BTC I could’ve got instead with the lower prices and here is this person destroying a fortune. I was jokingly like, can you give me some of that instead lol.
But seriously, If any eccentric Bitcoin billionaire  is lurking on here and wants to go nuts and destroy Bitcoins like this guy, send them to this  completely useless address:-

Thanks for the advice. I think I can transfer $10k a day on this Australian Bitcoin place. It takes a few days to process so within a few days I should have enough to buy 1. I’ve only got B0.03024914 at the moment. I want a full one at least before the price climbs out of my range. I was skeptical at buying 1 back when it was $200. I’m so pissed I didn’t get it back then. I could’ve brought a few. Then at $7000 I was thinking of buying 1 again but then thought it could crash so I still didn’t jump in. Now is my last chance before getting 1 climbs out of my reach. I’m planing to hodl through every dive and dip. I’m either going to make a big profit, break even or lose the whole loan. I’m prepared to accept all 3
