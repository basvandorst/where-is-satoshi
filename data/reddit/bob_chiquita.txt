You should be able to adjust your claimed exemptions for federal and state taxes. Increasing the exemptions will decrease the amount of taxes taken out of each paycheck. Ideally, you would not receive any tax refund and would have been investing or managing the money on your own instead of letting the government hold onto it.

If only there were some kind of nearly universally accepted method to quickly transfer funds in exchange for product or services. Maybe even a company would let you purchase things on credit and as long as you pay them back in under a month there's no extra cost to you. It could even be a card that you carry in your wallet along with your IDs and other important things that you might need on a regular basis. A "credit card" if you will. Nah, that's too fancy. I'd rather write out all of the information on a piece of paper that is obsolete and rarely accepted. But at least I have my phone and I'm ahead of the curve with my fancy internet money.

While unlikely, it's not impossible. It depends if it's worth paying for the service based on how much he actually had on there. A couple hundred dollars for the potential to recover tens of thousands?

This doesn't really mean anything. It's a promo code for a free ride. Of course people are going to start using a promo code that gets them something for free. The bitcoin promo is listed on retailmenot.com as well. If the promo code was "HitlerRocks" to get a free ride, I bet that would get just as much use, if not more.

You're joking right? Venmo is like sending a text to a friend that takes money directly from your bank account and puts it into theirs for free. 
Setting up an account is easier than coinbase and doesn't require any transfer fees as long as you're using debit for the transactions.

Debit is free.

Their "About us" is pretty fucked up with the suicide stock pictures.

Eh, we're both wrong. He was right.
He said 1 BTC = $0.0054.  
Or 5000 BTC = $27
You said $1.00 = 0.0054 BTC.  
Or 1 BTC = $185.18
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:35:18
$0.54 is 0.54 dollars.  
$0.0054 is 0.54 cents.

You're thinking 2017.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:00:13
$0.54 is not the same as 0.54 cents.

~~You both said the same thing.~~

He didn't spell it correctly, so no he didn't tip $500k.
