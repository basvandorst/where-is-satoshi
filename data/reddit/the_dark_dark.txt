what you just wrote, is the typical example of logical fallacies - if the stocks went up before, therefore it is a good idea to believe they will go up again.
Not if there's something wrong with it... not if it's a bubble.
But you short circuit your brain when you insist that negative stories being shared are some sort of "attack". This is what makes it sound like a cult. Your defense of that is to point at history - of a lassez faire market comodity - and insist that this somehow justifies NOT criticizing bitcoin's bubble!
You're POINTING at the bubble, to justify the bubble!
do you SEE IT NOW, BOBBY!?? DO YOU SEE!???

can you link it again? i don't remember.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:09:41
okay, but i spit on it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:44:09
again, no one is spitting ON YOUR FACE! It's your argument that's been spit upon because it sucks.
And that's why you aren't going to be rich - you're using circular logic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:51:17
i don't care about how you're doing though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:58
ohhh hahaha. I see how you can take it like that, but no. I did not mean to come across as objectifying *you*; "it" refers to your comment.
And no, i was not calling you folksy or charming either. This isn't a pick up line. Now calm down.

"All i'm asking for you to do is to stay in touch with me, occasionally check up on me, see how i'm doing. TOTALLY NOT FRIENDS, only a social experiment! It'll be fun! I promise! I'm a nice guy! I'm not an asshole like others! You should totally give me a chance"
go away, @_date: 2017-12-20 00:21:52
it being your argument.

the comments here read like a conspiracy theory circle jerk. Can no one articulate - rationally - why the article is wrong, rather than offering knee-jerk, low quality posts that typify the "omg this goes against my belief in bitcoin, therefore it must be a conspiracy!" crowd?

Folksy. I like its charm, but I spit on its illogic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:07:05
you're challenging me to follow you around like a fan and ask you things about your life.
why don't you try making friends in real life instead?

What about 11th breakfast, though?
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:33:08
They are both just as bad
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:08:39
lol bitcoins
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:25:44
Maybe an autocorrect from crashing?
