I feel like they could make more money selling and buying more btc.  I'm fairly certain that I heard somewhere the futures profit cap is 7% change. So not that much incentive

I agree and disagree; personally I hodl 60% of my btc and the other 40% I use for trading. For instance, this last month I bought in at 7900 and am considering selling that soon at a &lt;100% return!  Maybe I'm weird, but I like to play both sides lol
**I ONLY KEEP ~30% ASSETS IN BTC TO CLARIFY
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:03:46
But we can still hodl, and take the steady gains despite the spikes and dips! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:25:03
Isn't the volatility of btc the very reason futures trading would be attractive though?  Correct me if I'm wrong please.

One year ago, bought 6 coins. at around 1K. For some weed. A lot of weed. But just some weed.... I'd be set just off that!  After looking at all my deposits over the years on dnm, if I'd had just hedl, I'd be a whole lot richer../:

I mean 25% is quite a lot of a change, I guess not though if you consider btc history..
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:07
BUY HIGH SELL LOW, THATS THE WAY BTC TRADERS LIKE TO GO!
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:03:01
I believe there has never truly been an 'over-bearing' bear market (pun intended lol) in the history of bitcoin. Even when it plummets 80%, you're still looking at somewhat of a gain. And it you haven't experienced a gain yet, just hodl longer! 
And I don't think anyone should sell until they have reached their moon.  Day trading this speculative beast would be very difficult if that's what you're saying..

Ok, so what is the actual price that you go by? Gdax?  Because Ive been going by coinbase until I sell (localbitcoins.com) and I usually sell for $1000 over the cost per coin. So I consider the extra my gravy. Not really sure why it works like that, but I'm not complaining!

@_date: 2017-12-03 02:22:28
I understand that. I'm just saying that people still do illegal things and the hypothetical is plausible 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:02
In general, this is a good thing for the economy LOL.  They're kind of stating the obvious for all 'legal' income...
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:42:50
Now kiss
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:19:34
Not saying it's true, but there's tons of individuals who don't give a shit about what is illegal or not.  I mean if they did pass laws making it illegal to own, would you stop? I wouldn't!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:52:07
You shouldn't make promises like that against BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:50:29
Not really sure why people need to be told this! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:59:13
Hey, fellow lacombian! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:04
Futures contract profit is capped at 7%, so even if whales pump and dump, there's no use past the margin 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:16:46
It seems like this very truth is just an aspect of the freedom that btc and other cryptos represent.  Personally, I feel more in control of my assets without banks involved. But that's just me.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:56
Futures are literally going to be used as volatility protection for MINERS.  There's a 7% restriction on longs and shorts, so there's not really a ton of motive for pump and dumps.  Think about it, why would someone short a commodity? Think corn, wheat.

This is no input on recovery of your wallet, however, I had .03 btc earlier this year in multibit classic and it kicked me out of my wallet. No problem right? Well, my seed words would not work nor the password I never changed.  I switched to electrum; no problems since!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:20
How do you view the 'buy/sell wall'?  I find myself just refreshing coinbase &amp; CoinMarketCap with nothing other than the news I can find.  I figured there was a big sell, dropping the price so much!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:12:14
What else is a savings account doing? Sitting a week or two years. This is why you don't invest more than you can loose and these dips won't bother you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:13:03
Let's just not talk about it, it's depressing haha
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:30
YEP!  Unless you can buy/sell really quick and have a personal crystal ball 
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:39:46
I'm sorry I don't understand, you mean to send more coin ?
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:54:05
But the coins are in the transaction so it doesn't show up in my balance. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:25:21
Mine was cleared! So to prevent this delay from happening again, I just need to increase my fee to what generally? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:08:12
I actually own the other wallet; so you're saying to send the same amount to themselves again?
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:02:43
We're going to need picture proof
