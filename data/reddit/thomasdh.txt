You're right. The theoretical physical use of gold is seldom exercised by people not working as jewellers.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:41:23
No. This way it doesn't rely on altruism anymore.
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:07:08
The difference is that a certain amount of gold makes a ring, and a thousandth of that doesn't. There is no such objective metric for Bitcoin. I don't think it makes a big difference though.
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:55:08
I agree. The opposite of relying on altruism is trustlessness, arguably Bitcoins most important trait.

Why is it any better to harass this woman's Twitter page?
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:42:14
Yes, but a medium of exchange not necessarily currency. The judge decided it wasn't 'commonly accepted money' ('gangbaar' is difficult to translate), but other judges have said this term to be too vague. This man traded Bitcoins but only received half of the amount decided on, but since the judge decided that Bitcoin is a currency, it means the trader owes him much less.

I like milibits and microbits.

Why are you even asking? Yes, it is a Ponzi scheme, and yes, you should stay away from it.
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:01:30
Shh. It's secretly recorded in a studio...
@_date: 2014-03-22 07:05:21
That's a horrible thing to say.

Ideal actually is the name of a Dutch payment method also accepted at Steam.

You can also try to modify the image in any image editing program: change the black to a darkened version of the image and the white to a lighter version. That way the image becomes more clear.&gt;Thank you! This is very detailed
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:06:17
Yes. Instead of having an subscription to a lot of newspapers you pay a little to read only the articles you like.

Whether it is him or not, I feel uncomfortable seeing this picture all over the subreddit. Even if it was him, shouldn't we just leave him alone?

A confirmation means a block has been mined after the block that contains your transaction. Theoretically a part of the network could catch up with the rest and calculate another chain not containing your transaction. After 1 confirmation this chance is pretty slim, and after a couple it becomes very unlikely to happen. It still could though, and that's why there's no 'final' confirmation.

Until someone takes kyle it will redirect to your new page, it looks like.

Finally one that's intelligent!

It's just that Bitcoin if far from the standard, and most companies still immediately trade it to their local currency. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:48:46
Why? They can't forge anything, can they?
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:57:37
I guess empty diff blocks are not accepted by the network.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:05:37
If one party had 50% of the hashrate, this would be very bad. So I guess anything getting close to that is too centralised.
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:33:27
I don't think so. While I'm by no means an expert, I do remember that the proposal is only efficient when a large majority uses it. Furthermore, Classic is a fork and could (and likely will) just merge the changes.
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:54:27
No. Games require mass micropayments and they are not happening on chain any time zoon.

True, Core seems to be unwilling to compromise, up to the point of destroying Bitcoin entirely.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:28:04
I apologize. But when you call people with a different opinion 'terrorists' you should wonder why.
Core has ignored the wish to increase the block size for far too long (apart from the HK-agreement, which was subsequently ignored). The censoring of dissenting opinions on this sub only makes the polarisation worse.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:00:03
Which claim in particular is factually inaccurate?
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:19:53
You're proving my point. Only ideologues follow blindly.
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:39:28
Yeah. But the minority will most likely quickly join the majority, so all transactions only on the minority chain will have to be confirmed again on the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:18:24


There are major disagreements in the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:06:44
And you wouldn't want, say, a geocentrist being a major developer for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:01:30
Spoiler alert: good and evil are a spectrum. On both sides there are people believing things for good and bad reasons. It's why any post from a single person is a bad way to judge a wider opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:03:24
Didn't intend to post that 5 times…
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:37:03
Except the transactions that aren't confirmed aren't counted in this average.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:54:05
Bitcoin is built to circumvent trust. You should care about arguments because they're the only thing that actually matters. Distrust anyone who just wants you to trust them.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:42:49
I'm inclined to believe it isn't the best example of open-mindedness to say one side has no technological arguments or rational capabilities.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:26:19
You said not understanding the technical arguments was the reason you leaned towards You also implied that supporting at this point is an indication of a lack of faculty of reason. My apologies if I misrepresented your views. I personally do not think gives any decent technical arguments at all, and I think it's remarkable that only a sentence after that facetious comparison later you celebrate your own open-mindedness.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:29:54
Happy to hear that. I personally make sure I'm not too financially invested to prevent it from blurring my judgement.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:47:03
Then don't pick sides. Don't listen to promises but focus on current capabilities. Don't invest more than you can lose and expect any coin to be overtaken by something better.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:03:31
This is the go-to argument, but it doesn't hold up. Whether a block size increase happens via SegWit or via a simple HF, the bandwidth and storage needed increases in the same way. Mining centralization is a problem, but 1MB per 10 minutes is not what makes the difference. Not too long ago HF's were as uncontroversial for Bitcoin as they are for any other cryptocurrency right now. Also, SegWit has not exactly delivered the estimated 1.6x increase, more like 1.1x.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:51:09
Back when SegWit2x would still have been popular.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:02:57
The reason the fee doesn't rise indefinitely is because people then decide that the price is too high for their purpose.
