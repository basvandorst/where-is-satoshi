Just another 'no, unless you have the master public key'
Also, it's noteworthy to mention that you shouldn't treat any of the child keys as 'throwaways' or with any less security than a BTC address you generate regularly.
If you get Master Public + Child Public + Child Private, it's possible to backtrack to the Master Private key thereby compromising all of your addresses.

I guess my stance on this, unless you can think of a scenario that I can't, is that the threat of DoS attacks is just an omnipresent thing on the internet. 
It's not endemic to mining pools, much less this mining pool. It's just a problem on the web that people have to deal with all the time. Yes they're harder to spot, but not impossible. You also have to dedicate resources to mitigating DoS attacks all the time once you reach a certain size. Heck, being Google is pretty much one giant experiment in it.

With Bitcoin I've always found it helpful to think of 'sending' money this way.
Nothing moves, I take my money and destroy it to create your money. Nothing actually has to be transmitted to anyone. (There is a wide range of caveats to that statement, but that's largely beyond the scope of what you're asking)
Point being there is no send, there is creation and destruction. It's binary. Bitcoin is never 'in transit' and only has two states.
* Unspent Transaction Outputs
* Spent Transaction Outputs
The closest thing Bitcoin has to 'sending' is unconfirmed transactions that have been received by the network. But the process of confirming a transaction is literally taking Unspent Transaction Outputs, confirming the signature of they signing key is valid, 'converting' them into Spent Transaction Outputs, and creating a new set of Unspent Transaction Outputs under the control of a different key.
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:44:01
This is a common myth, but untrue.
Every time you transact in bitcoin, you're using a physical device, in the physical world, connected to a physical network that keeps track of EVERYTHING.
Anyone who has enough time and/or resources can find you in this physical space from that trail.

Nah man don't listen to this guy. He's projecting his life problems on to you.  Your question is a perfectly legitimate question and you shouldn't feel guilty for asking it.
Yeah, you have problems, we all do. But being 22, having less than a year left in college, 125k in the bank, and exploring other financial options for your savings isn't anything you should feel guilty about.

@_date: 2014-03-23 20:30:24
Nope, it's not a valid bitcoin address.
All valid bitcoin addresses start with a 1. 
Funny thing, most people think a Bitcoin address is your 'public key' but it's not, it's actually a hash of your public key. Subtle but important difference. 
This means that even if the ECDSA Bitcoin addresses are based on breaks tomorrow and becomes so easy to crack I can do it on pen and paper, Bitcoin addresses I've never spent from are still safe because their public key has never touched the network.

Works well for getting people's attention too.
I used it once to tell the top 5 miners on a friends mining pool to turn their difficulty up once they started getting ASIC's. Helped keep database costs down.
Also, I think the public notes are just Blockchain.info actually using a feature of the Bitcoin protocol that allows you to embed arbitrary data in a block, like when Satoshi put that newspaper headline &amp; essay in the first block. 
I could be mistaken, blockchain.info could be keeping a separate database on their own that's off blockchain, but I don't think that's the case.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong here.

Hoarding, in the manner you're talking about, doesn't exist. It's an economic impossibility.

Why would it be in their self interest to destroy a currency which they're so invested in?
* All the custom hardware they own.
* All the Bitcoin they hold
* All the man hours building the software they use
Why risk it?
You can't be certain they're benevolent, you can be certain if they double spend we'll notice and the jig will be up.
This is why I'm not too worried about a 51% attack by them. Not only are they participating members in the system, but ask yourself this...

Yeah but it's the manner in which they're proportionally distributed i'm talking about.
If it's the same as Eligius, they're proportionally distributed, but each block payout you get will either be all TX Fees or all Freshly Mined. This could explain the small TX's OP is seeing.

Do you have anywhere I could read up on the more technical aspects of how it accomplishes this?
While that will likely be a great thing for more people running full nodes, network connectivity, etc. I'm still not convinced it'll actually do anything to de-centralize mining. The economies of scale for the big guys make it trivial to implement at almost no cost, not so much for the little guys. Might change my mind after further reading, and if it does advantage P2Pool or even level the playing field, it'll probably be worth it anyway.
Oh, and congrats on the Thiel Fellowship man.

Eh, I think the distinction is more subtle and nuanced than you think it is.
The fact that you find your opinions or interpretations of reality at odds with his in this particular instance has no bearing on your intelligence or his.
I'd say it's more fun to look at all the assumptions and initial conditions and try and find what you agree on. That way it'll better help you figure out the (likely small) part you disagree on.

I'm kind of a noob at all this stuff, but I've been reading a lot lately and just off the top of my head...   


I don't follow your logic that only hashing the block header incentivises centralization of mining. Please explain further with technical or economic arguments.
On the alternative front...   


Explain how this de-centralizes mining at all. If anything, I believe it would further centralize mining. The economic cost for one huge farm to do this once on their internal network would be almost nothing, whereas the small time miners would have to put a much greater percentage of their total resources towards this, and much less towards mining. If what you're proposing does indeed make things as difficult as you say it will, which I don't believe is the case necessarily.    
Explain how to do this in a manner that won't consume massive amounts of bandwidth. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:56:15

I don't think it's an accurate indication of what the ability to transfer currency is worth at all. I think the 'value' you speak of is a better indicator of the massive amount of time, energy and effort that goes into keeping people from transferring money.
Stated another way, if Bitcoin replaced Western Union Dollar for Dollar in terms of how much money it transmitted on a yearly basis, that revenue number would be in the tens of millions.

The model you describe has no incentive structure to protect anyone but the validating authority, or the company/agency/government recommending or requiring the validating authority. This is the definition of a cartel.

Correct. But...


Bitcoin isn't just 'really secure', it's 100% public in terms of Read as well as Write, and not only that, it's done in a way that every coin is empirically verifiable just like an ounce of gold.
This I think is the crux of what you're missing. Bitcoin are physically provably unique just like Gold.

@_date: 2014-02-17 20:51:46
The fact is you can't have one without the other, we're both right. Neither are a problem, both are actually GOOD things though.
Hoarding is what gives bitcoin the security value.
That value is what allows bitcoin the technology to function as a medium of exchange.
It's a chicken and egg problem. I agree with you 100%, using bitcoin as a medium of exchange is a good thing. It's more efficient, it lowers costs, it's just plain better. But none of that would function without the store of value backing it up.
That store of value is backed by demand for bitcoin, aka 'hoarding' bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-04-06 18:28:47
I think the OP was asking something more along the lines of 
"If I have 10 miners doing work how do I make sure I get 100% hashrate out of them by making sure they don't duplicate work?"
And functionally the answer is "You can't and it doesn't matter that you can't, and the reason it doesn't matter is because of SHA256's collision resistance"
So yes, Intra-pool, the pool operator can be reasonably certain that two miners aren't going to converge on the same solution to the problem space (but not 100% certian) because he's given them different data sets to work on. But, Inter pool Eligius vs Ghash.io there is no way to tell this. Neither is there a way for me as an individual miner (with 10 BFL Vaporware Rig v3.5's that I got two weeks from now) to tell if I'm duplicating work because I'm working on the same dataset on every machine even if I'm mining on a pool.
AND, moreover, even if I'm not working on the same dataset because I wrote my own pool software and I'm throwing each miner a unique block to mine each time... It's irrelevant! Because the thought that you'll lose anything by 'duplicating work' in the problem space that Bitcoin is working with is absolutely patently absurd until you've got the hashing power to hash even 1% of the problem space in the lifetime of the known universe.

Haha, I was just commenting on the irony of it all, not actually saying it'll affect the outcome in any way.

Also, to reiterate, there is nothing free market about UL certifications.

This is a good answer, although I didn't know that about the arbitrary data part, can you link me to something to read on that?

Mom, Ryan is using the Reddit again!!
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:36:02
You can 100% trace every transaction via Bitcoin, that's the whole point of the blockchain. It's not even slightly anonymous.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:59:14
I agree 100%, but the way to state it isn't 'Look at how much Western Union is worth' that's like saying 'Look at how much value they're adding!' which, I think we would both disagree with.
I think the way to say it is "Look at how inefficient they are, we could do it for 1/100th the price" which is exactly what I was trying to say earlier.
Or another way of stating it "The monetary cost associated with money transmission is artificially inflated, and thus not an accurate indicator of it's value or worth, because of numerous artificial barriers to entry" 
And the last part I think is really the crux of what I'm trying to get at, in a society where bitcoin is the norm, the transmission of money would not be an extremely valuable thing. It would be dirt cheap, and that's better for all of us.

Yes, once there's a reliable way to short coin, 51% attacks go up in value about 100%.

I fail to see how this is any different than 'dark pools' on other exchanges. 
That being said, I don't pretend to be well educated enough to offer an argument as to the vice or virtue of such 'dark pools', but feel free to tell me I'm wrong Reddit.
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:56:45
It's less likely that these are donations and more likely that they're part of the block reward. Specifically the transaction fees. 
Not sure how P2Pool works but if it functions anything like lukejr's pool there's an algorithm determining who gets the TX Fees when based on where they are in the payout que, their hashpower, and how long it has been since they got TX fees as a payout. I believe this is done to create an equitable distribution between 'fresh blocks' while still distributing TX fees evenly across the pool.
That way if you feel like it, each payout is either all newly minted or all TX fees, and you can separate out the inputs accordingly.

If you're local to Seattle, come to the meetup!!
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:56:51
Good to know. I'd want mine to come in separate tx's personally.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:35:31
There's a saying where I come from. Not even sure who to attribute it to, but it's stated thusly.
Quitters never win.  
Winners never quit.  
Those who never quit and never win are morons.  
After the events of last week I'm thinking about adding an addendum on the fourth line;
Except when they're not.
I'll call it the Selkis Journalistic Asymptote. Throw in some math, fancy equations, a wikipedia article, and tack on 6 months for hindsight -- I'll be a genius.

If he's doing it right, yeah.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:07:27
Yeah I never had one of those either :-)
I should probably get one.

Asimov is THE BEST.
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:48:08
Yeah I've done this. Only works if it's your client or the service you're using supports the behavior.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:05:35
I don't see how I am, I think you're making a lot of assumptions I'm not making, or vice versa.
I'm most definitely describing a participating/equity/ownership economy, I don't see how I even alluded to renting at all, but I'm willing to discuss and change my mind if you can convince me. We should all be here to learn, hopefully.

Nope, Dustcoin's car.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:10:35
Correct, _but_ once you have access to your google account you can download the authenticator app onto a new device and have access to all of your authenticator codes for other sites.
Correct me if I'm wrong on that, I know I've switched phones 3 times and I've never had to re-initialize my authenticator anywhere. Then again, it could be pulling local backups from my machine when I sync the new phone, I'm not positive.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:13:14


I think he was talking about all of the smartass commenters who have the luxury of 3 years of perspective on the thing.
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:09:34
That's the thing though... go watch some of his other stuff. He's spot on in most regards.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:35:55
Google has the option to use one time authenticator backup codes. This will allow you to log in to your account and add the google authenticator app to other devices.
I recommend you generate these while you're setting up 2FA and store them somewhere safe. (TrueCrypt Partition on Dropbox is my choice)
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:40:54
Loans will become far more rare.
Things will switch to an ownership economy instead of a debtors economy.
Right now the incentive to issue loans is that you'll 100% lose all of your value eventually if you don't do something with the money.
With Bitcoin, this is not true. Therefore the only incentive to issue a 'loan' with bitcoin would be for potential gain. The best system we have for this isn't a 'loan', it's called Equity.
You would essentially become a shareholder of whatever or whoever you were loaning the money to.

The fee is entirely up to the person doing the sending at this point, and which client they use.
I know I'm sometimes frustrated by the Blockchain.info iOS app, as I once had a transaction sent to me that I know was valid take a week to clear. All because no feed was included (and it was small, just something for lunch).
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:26:14
It's common. Just wait it'll confirm.
The blockchain iOS app does not use the settings on your online blockchain wallet to set transaction fees, and is actually prone to not including any transaction fees at all when it feels like it.
I once had a valid transaction from a trusted friend take 8 days to confirm. It'll get there, just a lot of traffic right now.
Transactions are prioritized in this order 1) Fee 2) Size of TX 3) Age of Coin

While I don't disagree that use helps adoption, I don't think it's what drives it.
Also, I completely disagree that hoarding is a problem. I even think it's good for Bitcoin.

I don't understand the question and, sorry if this seems terse but, I don't think you understand what you're talking about.

Point of order. Hal isn't dead, he's mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive.

Let's refine further.
I think what you're trying to hone in on is 'You can't have a decentralized authority blockchain without value'
Edit: Well not a useful one anyway.
@_date: 2015-03-20 09:15:38
So because your expectations are different than their implicit or explixit commitments (I don't know I haven't read the TOS) _and_ you're to lazy to do it yourself, its their fault?
 
If I signed up for a service that prized security above convenience and I was worried about the timeliness of their execution... I'd chalk that up to poor planning on my part.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:49:47
People are paying less for bitcoin.

_If_ Brian, Fred 'n Co. are ladies &amp; gentlemen of their word, above reproach, and you trust their word with regards to the actual method of storing the coin in the Coinbase Vault system... wouldn't you rather it be this way than the alternative?
They advertised it as secure storage, not quick access. Fast, cheap, secure. Pick two.

You live in NCY, you need to double your rates man.
Biggest mistake I ever made freelancing was not charging what I was worth.
Those rates sound low for where I live, which is about half the cost of living of where you live. Seriously, double your rates you'll get more business.

TX Fees have nothing to do with trading, most trading is intra-exchange, not inter-exchange. Transaction fees only apply to transactions on blockchain.
Who's to say the previous two were causal relations anyway?

The danger isn't that Inflationary Currencies incentivize this kind of behavior (which they do), it's that inflationary currencies don't even provide you the option not to behave in this manner.
Knowing at the outset of any 5 to 10 year period that your savings is going to lose value unless you invest it prioritizes investment over savings, even if that 'investment' is mal-investment.
Furthermore, moving that capital from more liquid cash savings to less liquid investments like securities, stocks, property, etc makes the entire marketplace less agile and able to adapt to changing situations.
