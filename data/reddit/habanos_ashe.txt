Get a good accountant who helps wealthy people minimize their tax debt.  A good accountant will always do better than turbo tax.  Our tax code is very complicated, and the IRS and courts have added many layers on to that.

I'm gonna say this again, ask the advice of a good attorney who helps wealthy people... they can't help you do this, but do it wrong and you will be in medium security.  Ever wonder why lottery winners all end up broke? They don't prioritize getting good legal and financial advice!

This guy raises an important point. Most people don't see a bubble when they are in a bubble. And rapid growth is one of the key indicators of a bubble. One of the main factors of a bubble is that the asset is valued more than its practical worth (tulip bulbs in Holland, Mississippi Company shares in France). Is Bitcoin worth more than just  its speculative value? I'm not saying is a bubble, but you must challenge your assumptions.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:22:18
Bitcoin is an asset, like a stock.  Long term or short term gains when it is sold.

I guess you could always move to one of those libertarian countries like... um... you know I can't think to a single one
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:08:27
Yes, and I say this as a tax attorney.  But a good tax attorney works with an accountant.  Accountants are basically historians: they tell you what has happened and help you interpret it.  Attorneys advise on future risk: they warn you about pitfalls and perils.  The OP deserves to lose his money if he doesn't hire an attorney. A fool and his money....

Kind of obvious.  Alt right and libertarian folks like to see sinister evil conspiracies in everything, even shitty reporting. In reality, reporters are just underpaid, overworked, in an increasingly unprofitable industry, and don't have the resources or time to get it right.  Try talking to a reporter in real life about their life before you assume they a party to a massive fraud.

All money is just a fabricated story we all agree upon. Same thing with religion, status, governments, traditions, and gender roles. They exist and have value because we all agree they do., not because of any "underlying asset." Even gold: is this soft, urine-colored metal which can't hold an edge really more valuable than titanium because of inherent, objective physical properties? No! We just all agree it's valuable. "Gold is valuable because it can be made into jewelry. And jewelry is valuable because it is made of gold." Circular reasoning at its finest, but all financial talking-heads resort to it when talking about bitcoin, eventually.
He just doesn't agree with the people who value bitcoin. And he is disagreeing with the market.
