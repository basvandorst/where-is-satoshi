Its simply the way capitalism goes in a society thats increasingly driven by technology and consumer products.  The winners get bigger and bigger and the pie gets smaller and smaller for people not born into it.

It can't be that small if they are taking credit card.

I would think it would be more like a treasure map.  If it burned up in the fire you wouldn't get the value of the treasure, even if you knew the value of said treasure and could prove that it was where this map said it would be.  You just lose your treasure.

You are taking a beating in this thread for no reason.  They pretty much all sound like children.  The invisible line on a map argument,  are you fucking kidding me?  Isn't that the argument used in the movie blow? Didn't work out so well for him either.
Bitcoins good,  but people who lack common sense like this and the community backing it up makes me think twice sometimes.

You are sorely mistaken if you think this is why financial oppression is upon us.

Its never lost, its either in the wallets they were supposed to be in or they were transferred somewhere else.

I work with an insurance company.  I am going to ask their head of claims about this and will report back what their stance would be if anyone is interested.  Keep in mind this would be applicable in Canada only.

If the US dollar hits 0 everyone will have bigger worries than bitcoin prices.

You only hear about the epic failures.  You don't hear about the millions of successful transactions everyday.  Speaking from a generational standpoint, todays young entrepreneurs have a lot less to work with than their predecessors.  Cost of living, incorporating and starting up a business,  and education are all much more expensive now compared to previously, theres also a lot more competition in every market.
Couple all that with increased exposure to media who picks up on the worst of the worst companies and you get a recipe for thinking this generation is much worse than the ones that came before it.

It's about ownership.  Sure bitcoin is everywhere,  but you aren't. And when you spend money,  the person or corporation you are giving money to isn't. And if those two happen to not be in the same country some countries will have a problem with that. 
This has nothing to do with the medium of your payment even. Bitcoin is just better at hiding it for now. When it becomes a big enough thorn the government will find a way to stamp it out or use it to their advantage like everything else.
