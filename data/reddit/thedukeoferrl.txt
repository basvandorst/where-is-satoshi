I think you're kind of missing my point.. air conditioning doesn't become more valuable as people adopt it. Television doesn't become more expensive as it grown in market share. It goes the opposite direction. There is a fundamental flaw in this comparison, but I guess people are just looking past it.

3 seconds as of now... 3 minutes before trading is "supposed" to start... I don't even have to say it.

Lol - downvoted within one minute... If you're really that scared of someone playing devil's advocate that you immediately downvote anything possibly critical without watching or reading.

saying bitcoin is valuable for it's function is true, but in the same way that it is true for fiat money. 
And yes, bitcoin's value is a mix of speculation, and the fact that it fits the current economic landscape. A bitcoin itself is worth nothing. They are not technologically advanced, the technology driving modern computing, and the ideologies that make bitcoin special are advanced. Not the bitcoins.

Why would you think things would get better from here?

After reading all of it, it seems like redandwhite could be friendlychemist, and could have just gotten away with 6k+ in bitcoin

I'm guessing everyone saw yesterday's action, woke up this morning and decided to get some bitcoin.

bitcoins are not physical, technologically advanced inventions or innovations in and of themselves. Bitcoins are valuable because people are buying them, and speculating about their wealth. Air conditioning is valuable because it cools you down. Totally different.

Just posting this for information's sake. I think a lot of these arguments are invalid - comparing bitcoin to google stock in terms of being a currency... that's just dumb. Not to mention he doesn't get the price correct even though the article was posted today, and he compares them to tulip bulbs later on

I'm just going to drink another 4 beers and go to bed.. It's not like I enjoyed my bitcoins being valuable anyways.

Same goes for bitcoin from the talk of the video

This comparison is beyond stupid, and makes me worried that a lot of the people masquerading as intellectuals when it comes to finance are in reality, stupid people trying to justify their money spent on bitcoin. I mean, how can you honestly compare the number of people getting air conditioning to people buying bitcoins? Absolutely, and totally stupid. There is no point in time when the adoption rate of a new product "pops".. technology progresses, and new products are introduced. People aren't just jumping on the electricity bandwagon because their neighbors are....

Whoa now... don't spend that all in one place.
