I've heard a theory that long term at least, those that secretly rule do want the Euro to fail. They want the USD to fail too, so they can try an "Amero", which will also fail by design. The end goal is to introduce a single global currency to consolidate all power, and rule the world

Coinsetter is working out the process of converting shares of CaVirtex into shares of Coinsetter. It's normal for these things take a lot of time
I got this email response in July:
"We are still working out the details. All shareholders will be notified when things are completed.
Thanks for your patience"

if you own bitcoin and live in canada, and you convert it to dollars or buy something with it, CRA calls it barter though, you have to pay capital gains on it, which is 50% of your income tax

what are your sources for believing Coinsetter did not buy Cavirtex?
