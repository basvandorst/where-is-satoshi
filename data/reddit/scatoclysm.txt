Yep, looks like horseshit. Probably being forced to have to do KYC. Not sure if it’s trying to pull a fast one or to just offer something in exchange for KYC to incentivize it.
Either way can’t this type of service just be decentralized anyway since there’s no fiat involved? A decentralized version means there’s no one for the regulators to pinch the nipples of to force KYC.

How hard does your firm get pounded in the rear with fraud attempts?
I know retail exchanges get hammered pretty hard. Wondering how OTC is.

The ID stuff is usually because of laws in their county (KYC/AML). If they do not follow it, they can get shut down or have problems depending on the country. It's usually only when you're going dollars to crypto or crypto to dollars. Once you already have crytpo it's easy to avoid that crap.
If they're following those regymations, it's a least a good sign that you'd be able to take some action against them if try fuck you over. 
The photo of you  with ID is not anything to do with KYC/AML regulations. They're there to make sure it's actually a real person buying it and not a scammer going to rip off the exchange by using someone else's bank account or credit card. The amount of scammers ripping off exchanges is absolutely insane an that photo of our hding up ID has become a neccessity because of it.
I don't see much info out there in how bad that fraud/scam problem is. There was one episode if the Bitcoin knoedge podcast where they had the CEO of simplex on. He sort of spells it out a bit. But the fraud thing is the real reason for all of this intrusive stuff. Probly 3 out of 10 people signing up for an exchange account are scammers. They just need to trick the exchange long enough to transfer the coin.

The Australian banks were closing everyone down left right and centre about 4 years ago. They were claiming compliance concerns. One of their biggest banks received a massive money laundering fine not long after, but continued to shut down crypto exchanges.

The best part was them shutting down exchange’s bank accounts in 2014/2015 for AML concerns.
@_date: 2018-10-29 04:20:06
If they’re asking for ID docs and selfies as a seller *after * you verified through local bitcoins there’s also the chance they’re just taking the docs and using them to sign up for other exchanges. Either scamming them, or just masking their identity. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:58:30
It’s bullshit but all of this sort of shit got the current establishment to stop fighting it. The exchanges aren’t being closed down left right and centre.
At least if you want to go to crypto you can go fiat &gt;&gt; BS KYC/AML on-ramp &gt;&gt; decentralized exchange to Zcash (or some other extra anonymous coin) &gt;&gt; back to your newly generated hardware wallet BTC address. Then do what you want.
Before comprising on the compliance  garbage it was a game of whack-a-mole of banks shutting down exchanges. 
Overall I think the whole compliance thing is a ridiculous fucking load of shit, but it was necessary to help adoption. And as long as the protocols don’t ever change to integrate KYC or register your wallet address somewhere, then it should be ok.
Now that people can easily ditch their fiat for crypto you can avoid the compliance shit with the crypto to crypto swaps on Dexchnages. 
Doing anything to or from fiat and you basically have the bank recording it all for the gubbermint anyway.

If you're using a wallet from a provider (like block chain.info). Make sure that you can log in and out a few times. That's in addition to ensuring you have back up procedures in place as others have mentioned. If you have the BTC sent there, and are unable to access the wallet at all...your BTC is essentially lost.

Giving some BTC to kids to purchase Steam games or make other online purchases. Gift cards are available for many online services (Amazon, steam iTunes, Google play, etc.). BTC can be more universal though. Not sure how that stacks up against pre-paid credit cards though.

That KYC stuff is being forced on exchnages. When paying or relieving crypto, it's the only place realistically where the government can even try to really regulate it.
As someone else mentioned, watching the coins move from the exchnages address to your address (guessing they'd assume when it's transferred it goes to your own wallet address) it can be follwed using the block chain records.
You could just buy or acquire BTC. Then use a decentralized crypto to crypto exchnages that doesn't require KYC to trade it into something anonymous like monero or zcash. Then from there transfer it back into BTC.
That would retain your privacy. Or as the government would call it...laundering (anytime you want privacy you're automatically a criminal to them).
