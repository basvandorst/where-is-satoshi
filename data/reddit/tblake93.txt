I absolutely love Primedice!
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:21:00

Kingdom of heaven?
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:42:56
I'm the same way sometimes depending on my BTC balance at the moment lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:24:06
Aww I don't think I made it in time :(
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:03:06
I believe its a great idea. I'm 21 and just recently learned about all this and I have a similar goal/plan. Mine is to make 20 BTC by my 22nd birthday in 5 months, while still paying bills and trying to enjoy life

That's always great news to hear! 20 bits @_date: 2014-11-06 07:36:43
That's awesome, I've only been tipped on the site once when user: gws714 went positive and tipped everyone in the chat. Other than him I've only gotten the Rainbot tip maybe 5 times in total :/

Thank you very much I've always wanted my own Oprah! :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:24:53
Yay :)
@_date: 2014-11-05 09:46:21
So your a faucet tipping rolls of toilet paper? I've still yet to understand Reddit and ChangeTip I guess, funny keyword for the tips lol.
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:49:39
Dam I'm always to slow :(
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:25:57
Yay! Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:39:43
Wow if it could be pulled off there might be a viable way to attempt to "control" the rise and fall of the value maybe. So it would not be good at all for the crypto community
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:24:37
If only I had 1 satoshi for every thread like this lmao
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:23:05
Thank you very much! :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:29:55
Wow thank you very much!! :D

Still pretty new to all the BTC stuff but I definitely have to get all of my friends turned onto Reddit. Namely and just to start with!
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:58:03
Heck yea way to spread the love :D
@_date: 2014-11-06 02:40:08
Omg, wow an Oprah. That is epic Diapolis! 250 bits @_date: 2014-11-06 02:38:56
Much crypto love and Happy Cake Day!
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:29:02
Wow thank you very much!

Personally I believe that Bitcoins can never be shut down, and that the We the People actually subtly control the price of BTC due to the fact that at any time if any person, given thy have enough money, can either make the price rise for buying so many at a higher price or they can sink BTC by selling their decent sized amount of BTC for absurdly low prices therefore making the price overall drop. But there are a lot of highly improbable hypotheticals in my belief. I believe why he changed his opinion could simply be that due to some other outside influence, he went on camera and stated the complete opposite of his beliefs earlier?
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:58:55
That is an awesome idea and good luck on spreading crypto love! :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 07:43:02
No it's like Christmas whenever RainBot hits but I just don't have that good of luck and end up losing it all
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:48:02
Aww looks like I'm to late :(
