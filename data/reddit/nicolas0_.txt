Ummm, I don't fully understand, why is there such a huge difference between sites, coingecko is 17.9 cex.io is 19.2?

Lol yeah, look at op what a loser, he is a pussy for not hodling
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:42:38
What I don't get is; if bitcoin is supposed to be smth that is used as a normal currency, why do you guys speculate all the time with the hodl memes, hodl is just a small dip and talking about winnings.
BTC is being destroyed and is a bubble imo, I certainly wouldn't invest my life savings now

Lol 10k

I do, but not with BTC, i want to believe but with other cryptos more stable and with a cheaper price per unit which means easier to use, would need to have faster transactions and lower fees, iota, litecoin... Etc

Big slip**
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:09
Yes, but many people have suddenly got into bitcoin that will jump out and there won't be enough people to make it bounce
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:37:37
Same way I forgot about the dip from 7 to 5k, that was more serious haha
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:36:52
Oh, yeah, you're right, didn't catch on that one, but I strongly believe that BTC has to crash, not that it will benefit me, just history
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:20
I know each one should only invest what they can afford, but I personally don't think a future like that would happen 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:18:18
Probably, and also that that it is decentralized and yada yada, but I seriously feel this is a huge dip prob catastrophic, in the last week's lots of people I know have mentioned bitcoin, they just follow market trends and will sell as they see their loses.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:46:59
See, I'm not interested as much about earnings with cryptos and more about daily usage, and BTC isn't the one prepared for it now
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:04
So, I'm interested are you going to hold or sell and migrate to other cryptos? Curious
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:42
Yeah right?
