One thing that makes a difference is how well established Uber is in your area. Early on they treat drivers well, and pay well. The conditions and pay deteriorate badly over time, as more drivers come on board and they reach critical mass.

This isn't "banning crypto"; it's "criminalising the use of crypto". You can't stop people from using crypto, but you *can* send them to prison for it.

It's one that has a "CD-Rom" drive,  for reading "optical disks". They are also sometimes called a "Multimedia Computer", and are powered by super-fast "Pentium"  processors. If you switch on the "turbo button" on one of these ultra high powered machines, you can hack Bitcoin in *seconds*.

By criminalising something, you don't necessarily stop people from using it, but you *do* create the possibility of prosecuting those who are caught.

No, duh. Obviously used "5"s instead of "S"s, or he would have been hacked ages ago.

My guess is it's probably just a case of the old-school grapevine. Being heavily marginalised and in an extremely high-risk job, sex workers need to look out for each other, and communicate with each other a lot (e.g. To share information about non-paying or abusive Johns); they probably have viral-style communication across their community down to a fine art (especially since they also need to protect everyone's privacy).

Except it would have been *a play on* if you had said "There can **be only** 21 million". Instead, it's just a largely unrelated sentence.

It's not a drug, it's a drink. 
Edit: Context: a [famous quote]( from the absolutely unparalleled, British, current affairs satire "Brass Eye". Thanks for the downvotes.

You fluffed it. The line is "There can be only 1".

Dude, I'm not suggesting anyone dump. I really am not, and I won't be dumping any time soon. The thread is an attempt to try and understand WHAT and WHY this is happening? There's a lot of talk in the comments on all the other threads, I just want to try and collect everyone's thoughts in one place.

Great news. Combined with the recent news about the Cypriot economy, that goes some way to describing the past few days' worth of insanity. There's still 2+ months of the best soap opera I've ever seen that need piecing together?

Pretty sure a click on my profile would show I live in UK. 
Just to get rid of any uncertainty :) Although, our clocks change any day now... So I actually have no idea what time it is at the minute.

I assumed s/he was insinuating I was a liar, based on the fact s/he knows, somehow, that I struggle to get up before noon ;)

True. One reason I can think of is Kim Dotcom promoting his scamming "Bit Coin Credit Card" bullshit; he's now got one hand in all of our pockets.. 
Again, what I would like is to try and do is collate all our brainpower into one thread, rather than scattering ourselves around comments,  and try and figure out a time line that we all (almost) agree is a 'single point of truth' about what's happening.
