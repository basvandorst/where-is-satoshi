Ah, got it, thanks for explaining. :)

Really, it means that someone who has access to Satoshi's that account is following the news on Bitcoin on a daily basis.

Wrong kind of isk ([this]( is what you are getting a conversion for, not [this]( In while in manny MMO's you can trade in game currency for USD under the table, CCP has tried very hard to to prevent people from doing this as legal issue arise if their in game currency becomes an actual currency.

There are a few, but they all have their flaws.
[This]( is one of the better ones.

If the difficulty becomes high enough it will require the the output has for all blocks be all 0's. You can't have more leading 0's then there are characters in the hash. There may be a smaller limit that I am not aware of, but this is nothing to worry about because it takes a ludicrous amount of computing power to get there. And besides, if we are able to generate an exact hash in 10 mins, we will have bigger problems then not being able to increase difficulty.

I think you may have some misconceptions about reversibility. Reversibility means you sell something and you get payment then the buyer says "just kidding" and gets his bitcoin back. It is a feature of bitcoin, not a drawback. (Note: This is oversimplified)

I think you might be confused here.  Firstly, there are no profits for running a node,  and secondly mining doesn't come to an end. The mining reward is decreased over time,  but the idea is transaction fees (that are given to the miner on top of mining rewards)  would compensate. There is a question as to if enough people will run full nodes without being paid, and if transaction fees alone will be enough to incentivize the miners,  but this sounds like it is not what you are asking.

Just because all hashing algorithms that have a set output length necessarily have collisions doesn't mean that this is fine. The problem is not that any collisions exists, as you pointed out that is a mathematical certainty. However the difference is that there is an actual weakness in SHA1 that allows for the generation of colliding hashes with less computational power than you would expect if the algorithm was not vulnerable.
For example, we all know MD5 is broke as fuck, but that isn't just because the keyspace is small. Take a look at [this article]( by a guy who shows you how you can *engineer* two input to collide very easily by targeting the weaknesses in MD5. Yes, one of those steps was crunching a bunch of numbers on AWS, but not nearly as many as searching for collisions randomly would be.
tl;dr: The problem is not that collisions exist, but how easy it is to find them.

Seriously. I have been reading both sides and have seen a frightening lack of realism, concessions, or compromise. I think both sides have merit and both sides have valid concerns, but you won't hear anyone saying that. Why are people so desperate to make Bitcoin one thing that they would prefer to kill it before letting it be something a little different?

Don't invest in USD. It's too expensive, so you will never have a whole million dollars. That's why I put all my money in the Zimbabwean dollar. With those I can be a multimillionaire. Way better!

Unless I am not seeing something, there should be a way of showing how long the content that I am paying for. I am totally down for paying for content, but I want to know how much I am getting. Would you pay $1 for a 2 minute video? No. What about for an hour and a half movie?
Sure this says nothing for quality, but if I could get a small sense of quantity I would be much more willing to open up my hot wallet.
Edit, Just realized you are the content creator and not the platform creator... Can you put episode lengths in the thumbnail? Is there a way to send feedback to popchest.com? Just my .0002 BTC

While that is nice, and I understand why you are making sure the user's know this, this is not as huge a benefit to users as your comment would make it seem. Here's why:
Your comment implies that Coinbase handling transaction fees will save you time and money.
Does it save you time? Not really .Just about every wallet has default transaction fees automatically added to transactions.
Does it save you money? Again, not really. Sure, when you send transactions through Coinbase, sure they will cover the cost of the ~$0.10 transaction fees, but at the same time when you buy and sell any substantial amount of BTC on Coinbase you are paying them a fee for that service. The fee you pay Coinbase is going to be significantly more than the 10 cents you save here and there when moving BTC around.
This is not a bash of Coinbase. I use them and love them, but I don't want users to come away thinking that they are getting some amazing deal that they will only get by using Coinbase because they cover the cost of transaction fees for you.
(This comment is more directed to/for the benefit of OP than as a reply to John)

This is correct (unless he has another address that you dont know about that he doesn't send coins between). The two exceptions are off block-chain transactions (imagine a user of a bitcoin service like blockchain.info sends money to another. blockchain.info doesn't necessarily need to push a transaction through the blockchain), and mixing (obscuring the destination of a blockchain transaction by mixing it with other transactions).
For those of you smarter than I, correct me if I'm wrong.

Really? My understanding was that the Coinbase vault was a 2-of-3 address where I hold 2 of the keys. Coinbase makes is pretty clear that they aren't able to move your coins at all without at least one of your keys. Do they still have some control over my coins that I don't know about just because they have 1 of the 3 keys?

Stability is a valid concern for a business owner. This reply does not address that. The truth is, places like bitpay allow you to convert BTC into USD (almost?) Instantly, so you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to keep in mind is that as adoption grows, volatility will (may) decrease because a smaller percent of bitcoins total value will be traded at one time.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:38:16
Isn't this similar to how USD used to have intrinsic value because of gold backing. And BTC had intrinsic value due to its perceived anonymity/utility. in other words what gives USD more intrinsic value than BTC in his eyes?
