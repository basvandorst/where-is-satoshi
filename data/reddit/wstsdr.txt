Watch Alex Winter’s documentary“Deep Web” (Epix) for an in depth summation of the entire case and context.

But that’s as ridiculous as asking if the internet went down would we lose our coins? Well, yeah basically.

Demand in large numbers. 
More people want to sell = price goes down. 
More people want to buy = price goes up.

But you can’t even buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin because it’s too slow. It’s useless as actual money.

Micro payments. Imagine paying to use adobe photoshop where each mouse click sends 0.00001 IOTA to Adobe. Or where each retweet generates income for both you and Twitter. Every page of information is exchanged for a token worth a billionth of a penny. A new economy.

No. The mystery of Satoshi‘s identify is huge and baffling.

So just buy a different crypto.

Exactly. Bankers are so backwards protesting against Bitcoin when they should be embracing Bitcoin instead, not protesting it.

Jesus four grand??
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:45:33
four grand = $4000

I was just wondering that. Surely he has grammatical patterns that could be identifiable too. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:00:48
It didn’t. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:18:50
Exactly. Bankers protesting bitcoin is ultimately futile because bankers should be embracing bitcoin not protesting bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:28:05
See r/bitcoinmarkets 
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:36:04
Surely someone can analyze grammatical patterns and figure out who he is.

No I’m right I just posted a week early.

My own stupidity never ceases to amaze me...

~~$1000 would be $1,000,000 now. And that's at *today's* prices!~~

I'm investing recklessly.

Words poorly scraped into a penny huh?
Not sure this marketing strategy is likely to appeal to... anyone at all.

Best documentary I’ve seen all year. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:46:29
Exactly. See also: vendors accepting crypto. 
Vendors will accept crypto as payment once enough people own it. They’ll say “spend *your* crypto here (as opposed to “we accept crypto” - subtle difference).
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:29:00
They won’t. Because you can’t refund it, this it’s a scammers paradise. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:19:24
Yeah that was my only gripe with the video.

It’s a buzzword for sure but that doesn’t mean blockchain tech is invaluable. It’s early stages but the potential is enormous.
