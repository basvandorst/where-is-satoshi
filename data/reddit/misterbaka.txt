Getting 4.5% a day for weekdays and 1% a day on weekends.  Interest gets added to your account every hour.  Withdrawals seem fast too.  I've only invested LTC so I cant speak for BTC or ETH.

Hey, I've used it for a week now, I've been able to withdraw.  So far so good.  I like that I'm able to deposit LTC or ETH instead of BTC.
If you're interested please sign up using my referral.

They claim they are helping facility anonymous transactions and they charge the fee off of that.
The min time is 6 weeks.  The min withdrawal is .1 LTC, 0.005 BTC, or .01 ETH

It's very possible but I've seen sites claiming 10% everyday stay in business longer, so I decided to take a chance.
It also helped their interface is easy to use and they accepted LTC.
As always any site claiming over 1% daily can become a Ponzi, so don't invest what you cannot lose, the risk is always there.

Where can I put my bid in for a set of these?

No, initial investment is included in the interest payouts. so the 147% is 100% your initial investment + 47% interest.

Made several LTC investments over the past few months.  I’ve already have a few completed deposits.  I will probably deposit more again.
