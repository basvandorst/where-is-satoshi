The huge sell off temporarily depressed the price by eating up the bids at the top of the buy order list. Most people with asks in place were not willing to drop their ask prices to meet the new price. Maybe a few people and some bots placed lower asks but most everyone knew the price was going back up so low asks were not placed in any appreciable volume. Demand continued to eat at the asks at the suppressed price and the bid prices creeped back up to where they were.
Looking pretty bullish, bitcoin.

Not to mention that bitcoin has legendary uptime statistics. I think there was a hard fork once a couple years ago but that's it for downtime. Bitcoin literally always works. Yay decentralization!

In Proof of Stake systems, you aren't paid to literally do nothing. You perform the same function as proof of work miners: processing transactions into blocks for the network. You are also taking on a large amount of risk by holding the bag against speculators.

I didn't include the 2010 fork because there was no downtime (?), only the March 12, ~~2014~~ 2013 fork. Here's the javascript that generates the percentage:
    &lt;script&gt;
    var timenow = new Date().getTime() / 1000;
    //current time in seconds from the unix epoch start
    var downtime= (6*60*60+20*60);
    //6:20 of downtime on 3/12/2013 
    //converted to seconds
    //source: 
    var totaltime= timenow-1230951265;
    //where 1230951265 is the number of seconds since the unix epoch start at the time of the first block on Jan 3 2009 02:54:25 GMT
    var uptime = 100*(totaltime-downtime)/totaltime;
    var printme = uptime.toFixed(9).toString().concat(" %");
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = printme;
    &lt;/script&gt;
If anyone has more accurate downtime statistics, let me know and I'll update the site.

In the sense of cryptocurrency, your public keys (receiving addresses) are all derived from your secret private key. You can think of your public key as a username and the private key as the password.
With quantum computing, the thought is that by just having a public key one could unravel the private key and steal bitcoins, rendering the entire system useless.
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:17:32
We saw the bottom and a market rebound. Everyone who sold for fiat at the top of the last bubble is trying to get back into BTC before this upcoming bubble.

Thanks for researching this. Because all other transactions were processed, I'd say this is not downtime.

Once bitcoin starts taking a bite out of their pie it will be too late. Hell, its already too late. You can officially and legally ~~bribe~~ lobby US public officials with bitcoin. Banning bitcoin at this point would be a violation of free speech and thusly unconstitutional.

The investor in me wants bitcoin to succeed because I will make money.
The libertarian in me wants bitcoin to succeed because it will take power away from the governments and back into the hands of the people.
And the human in me wants bitcoin to succeed because it will end the reign of terror thrust upon the world by the banks. Every blood sucking banker that is replaced by bitcoin is a net positive for the common man.
The internet gave the people knowledge. If bitcoin succeeds it will give the people power.

Rather than downvote you I figure it would be more productive to present some facts.


This might have been a valid argument back when fiat currency was backed by metals. However, the dollar is no longer backed by gold, it is "made up" by the United States Government (and they are making more of them up every second, because they can). If you back the dollar, you are trusting in the continuation of the US Government. If you back bitcoins you are trusting in the security of the bitcoin protocol. They are both "made up" in the sense that they have no physical basis.


Most transactions are sent in under a minute. It's true that one could double spend their BTC without a confirmation in the block chain, but this is notoriously difficult to do and there are ways to prevent it.


Satoshidice contributes a large portion of the transactions in each block but the system is not broken. If I send you coins you WILL get them. There has never been a case where someone had a transaction dropped because there were too many transactions.


As a self proclaimed nerd, bitcoin is protected by the math of encryption. The [SHA-256 algorithm]( is considered mathematically difficult. Even if you had a mass of supercomputers the size of the sun you still wouldn't be able to break the algorithm.
Don't be ignorant and slam bitcoin because you don't understand it. You're better than that. You can read more about how encryption works here: 
You can read about bitcoin's actual weaknesses here: 
If you read over my points and reply, there might be some BTC in it for you ;)
