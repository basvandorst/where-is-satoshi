Here in France I think most people heard about it, and most of the time they didn't pay attention at all, but I could easily say more than 99% of people doesn't really know what it is and couldn't answer basic questions on it. For the remaining 1% only a few bought some, and often it's the youngest ones (millenials like me !), and most of them are geeks doing it for fun or because they heard about it thanks to Dogecoin on jeuxvideo.com. Even in December when the media said it was skyrocketing on main TV channels TF1 and M6 (2 biggest TV channel), almost nobody paid attention. Most of people here think it's a scam or find it risky even if they don't know it at all. Even the name "bitcoin" seems to be too complicated for some and they couldn't make the link between "bit" and "coin" because most people doesn't give a clue and don't speak english... Most don't even know how to spell it right !

With all those "Blockchain Conferences" around, people should use them to help promote Bitcoin a bit more and educate people and newcoiners, this should be the first step. Too many FUD still in minds of people since December, and we saw it at Consensus, it was a big fail. Everything depends on Bitcoin, that should be taken in mind god damn seriously. Those places should also be used to denonciate scams and bad behaviors (who said BCASH ?). The whole crypto world would beneficiate. For now those conferences only deal with "new blockchains uses" or "new ICOs" or stuff like that, but it's not the point (yet) ! We need Bitcoin rockstars to do that.

Have a plan, stick to it. Mine is : if price goes &lt; 5k, i'll start buying a lot more. If price stay above 6k, i'll hodl it 'till it spread worldwide. And only spend money you can afford to lose.
In your case, you should hodl hard if it goes under 5k, that's all you should do, and thinking increasing your stacks.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:40:26
Well, another and better buying opportunity then. Will buy more if that happens, and would feel like a whale accumulating

En effet, pour faire simple, ce n'est qu'une image représentant une fausse pièce symbolique fabriquée en chine représentant le logo qui a été attribué par la communauté aux bitcoins, qui eux sont bien réels mais 100% dématérialisés. Donc on ne peut pas les voir ni les représenter physiquement étant donné que ce ne sont que des suites de 0 et de 1 cryptées et enregistrées sur des espaces de stockage tels que des disques durs ou des clés USB, le tout transmis et partagé sur internet.

Here are my top10 advices to a newcoiner like you :  
1/ Don't buy BCH, it's shitcoin. Only BTC.  
2/ Don't trust bitcoin,com website. It's not bitcoin, it's BCH's site. Yeah, i know : WTF ?! This is why 1/.  
3/ Never give your "private key" to someone you don't trust. Don't loose it. Never.  
4/ Right now the price is quite cheap. It's probably just above the bottom. It's a good place to buy. Just don't hit me if it falls deeper.    
5/ Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  
6/ Educate yourself, read news, there are a lot to understand, it's going to take months to understand the details, and for someone curious it's really interesting.  
7/ Don't (over)trade. Just buy and don't panic if you see red everywhere and -50% or even more.  
8/ Be careful on what you're reading. Some are just FUD or fake news.  
9/ Your strategy with low amounts is not that bad (for now).  
10/ Beware of the fees. They can be huge, especially for small amounts.
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:20:00
Mining hashrate is still god damn high, we just reached new ATH... mining competition is really hard nowadays ! I think no miners should sell at those low prices because of this !

Just bought 1TH at genesis mining, paid in BTC. I was totally impressed by the payment process. The second I sent my BTCs, the website notified me it was a success. It's the first time I buy something with BTC and I just realised how amazing BTC is. It was faster than using my credit card and clicking all the buttons and waiting for SMS confirmation code.
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:16:52
I did same with \+€10k. I don't care either but I will explain why :
\- I trust in the tech &amp; in the devs for what they did from 0, and I just have to look around where we are now to see how it's growing exponentially. Whole world is going to use it, everywhere. It's just awesome. It's becoming an industry, and a big one.
\- If it falls a lot, there will always be people loving to buy them only for collection. Bitcoin is legendary and will stay forever for what it did, even if it crash some day (which I dont think so for the next decades).

10 transactions for NOW doesn't mean it's going to stay like that for EVER. Softwares can have UPDATES. People should remind this when they say shit like bitcoin doesn't scale and so on, and I'm not even thinking about second layers on Bitcoin's protocol like Lightning which are probably only the first step. Years of work and research will probably change everything you care about. You're thinking like in 90's when people thought Internet was a failure and only Intranet would be used ever because Internet was too slow, too expansive, and you couldn't watch videos online !

I always do the same when I buy alts : If I use 0.1 BTC, I buy back 0.2 BTC. I'm ending with more &amp; more BTCs and I feel way more confident over time for two reasons : Bitcoin is and will stay the king, and some alts are probably nice too (for other use cases). This is how I diversify. But I always come back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:22:59
I think if you're a rich guy, they will do all they can to help you keep your funds safe, especially the switzerland banks, for extra fees. They would benefit from it. And they couldn't rekt you because they don't want bad advertising. It's a business...  And you shouldn't give them all you got, only "savings".
But well, time will tell, for now it's too early to tell how it's going to work. Maybe you're right, maybe not, so just keep your keys untill you're 100&amp; safe.

Don't do that. Buy bitcoins first, then maybe some alts, the ones you prefer/think they're going to success/or just random if you feel lucky.
You should keep your bitcoins safe, they're probably the more importants. A good ratio would be 60-100% bitcoins and 0-40% alts.

Okay, $3570 \* 0.28 = $1000. So... 1% of the worlds population can own $1000. Something must be wrong there.
Wait, maybe the price is undervalued ?!

Exact sentence : " That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings. "
So he own 0.25 BTC... that's something most of people don't have yet.

This is not completly false. Bitcoin (and eth) WILL be available in more than 3k tobaco shops in January, but it's true that it's only thanks to a startup and France's Bank has nothing to do with it. It all depends on a new tobaco sales  software developed by Bimedia in partership with [KeplerK]( So, basically, people WILL be available to buy crypto in some tobaco shops in France (they will receive a ticket), and will have to go on that website to claim their coins. This is not something huge but this is great, adoption keeps going on.

Just hodl, and that's not BS. Let's say you have gold: even if you could easily pay you a coffee, you wouldn't. You would prefer hodling it very preciously until you want to sell it some day EVENTUALLY because it's a store of value. I know bitcoin could easily be both cash &amp; store of value, but it's still not really famous and widespread adopted, you would better hodling it than spending all you have for 2 pizzas ! Don't forget we're only on the SECOND halving period, so we have some room to mine still lot of supply, and people should probably still wait few years from now. I'm betting on very long term investment.

The point is to never go back to fiat at some point, but this time has not come YET. For now, I and a lot of smart people are preparing themselves for the worst fiat failure ever on earth, so we diversify buying Gold or Bitcoin (or other stuff, everything else but fiat). Personally, I prefer bitcoin, easier to carry around and to pay stuff with it. Some expect to never go back to fiat ever and to buy everything directly with BTC. Salaries in BTC, prices in BTC, etc. For now, there are yet technical progress to do and we are only at the beginning. Personally, I call 2018 year 0, and we are all around only early adopters.

Of course there is risk of failure, but I seriously think the worst is behind us. I don't know how it will end, nor if it will end, but I know what I see, and all I see is huge potential, that's enough for me to invest some money, of course it's money I can afford to lose. But that's worth taking the risk.

I installed the android lightning app you said, and now I don't know what to do with the 1000 sats you gave me. I understood there is some "invoice" to create somehow but I just don't get it with all this "Open channel" system. Do I have to open a channel ? How to do so ? Will it cost me something ? And then, how to create that Invoice so I can get my 1000 sats on my lightning wallet ? How to transfert them to a BTC address ?
Thanks for help.

Truth is I have way more bitcoins now than I thought I could have some day 1 year ago, thanks to those cute bears. I almost got what I wished I should have some day to be safe for the rest of my life. Even if I'm at a loss for now I'm sure we will win long term, so if the price keeps falling, even if that's not what I would like, I'll just buy even more. I'm sure we are a lot doing the same, and we are probably more than ever before. Last year increase in price attracted a lot of smart people too. I won't panic sold, even if it goes to 0. I believe in the tech and I believe in the smart people to realize banks are a real scam since the begining and we have to replace them by something better, and bitcoin will be perfect for that in the futur.
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:47:44
Let's educate yourself on bitcoin and you will understand.
Anyway, right now is probably a good call buying some. Just don't overlook at it if it's fiat value decrease again. Just look at it in some months and hold it. With a bit of luck, your btc holdings can worth millions actual $ in some years.

Bcrash crashing, BTC bouncing and falling again (thanks bulls buying dips), and SV mooning, we can see what's going on : morrons attack BABC and sell both BTC and BCH(BABC) to do so. All this shitshow since BCH exist is nonsense. It's a shame to have people so greedy in cryptoland. They are putting the whole ecosystem in danger for their shitcoins nobody want and nobody care. There is no place for that.

Don't do this. Too risky.
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:40:20
This is probably a not-so-bad time to buy some. This could be better, but I wouldn't take much risk waiting anymore when you see &gt;80% drop in price over a year of bear market. But I think you will have few months to buy near those levels. Just don't panic if it falls from here, just buy what you can afford to lose and you will be fine. If you buy some and can't stop watching the price and can't sleep well, then it's not something you can afford to lose.
My best advice would be to buy now and leave it for good for few months/years before watching the price again (so you can sleep well and live your life without this in mind all the time). If we are lucky, and there is a good chance, we will buy a lot of stuff with BTC in few years and we won't have to sell for fiat anymore.
