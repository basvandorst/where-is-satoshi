And the Austrians' counter argument to *that* is that we can perform controlled experiments on those other subjects, which we certainly cannot do on the economy. 
Austrians don't argue that you can't know *anything* about it, but that the kinds of things we can know about it are limited by the nature of the system, which I think is a sound epistemological stance.

Aaaand, (going into speculative mode here), consider the following: 
* The unbanked population is among the poorest. 
* They now have a more compelling reason to adopt the currency than the relatively rich, who get by fine with dollars and credit cards.
* If and when bitcoin does its moonshot thing, the poorest part of the population will be holding some amount of the currency.
* Because of the appreciation of value implied in widespread adoption, the poorest population will very suddenly become a lot less poor. 
* Some, not all, will become a *lot* less poor, and we'll see some really strange and exciting movement between the class boundaries. 
* Newly wealthy, formerly lower-social-stratum people will be in a position to entrepreneurialize. 
* Therefore, we can forsee a bull market in all the things that people of that social stratum enjoy.

In principal, yes, economies are (stochastically-) deterministic systems, like the bodies of organisms. 
And that's an excellent point: medicine understands very little about bodies. Certainly the preponderance of, for instance, *metabolism* is unknown. Can it be known completely, or even just more fully? Because medicine can use the tools of science -experimentation, control, replication- empiricism can reveal the true relationships between causes, with a high degree of confidence. 
Can the same be said to be true of the study of economies? Can we apply experimentation, control, and replication to our hypotheses about how economic agents interact with eachother? We can experiment, yes, and the last century is rife with grand experiments. Can we control the experiments, such that we can replicate results and thus attain a measure of certainty that our results are not the product of chance? We are speaking of human events, wherein the agents are exposed to constantly differing external circumstances, about which they can respond to as they please, according to any conceivable decisions criteria, so I have difficulty imagining any other answer than "no" to the question. 
One must be aware of the limitations of one's tools in order to use them effectively. Science is a powerful tool, but its power is not unlimited. A  good philosopher of science understands that not all problem domains are accessible to the method. 
The comparison to medicine has another valuable offshoot: when doctors experiment with bodies, they risk killing the test subject, and the practice of medicine has strongly enforced codes of ethics governing this risk, because it is recognized that the wanton destruction of life is not worth whatever might be learned from it. This ties experimenters' hands, and prevents them from learning things that they might otherwise be able to uncover. Now, in all seriousness, what happens when economic experiments go badly? Life is at risk there too, often on a much larger scale, and I would be so bold as to suggest that practitioners of economic experiments should hold themselves to at least the standard that the medical practitioners do, in terms of ethical restraint. 
Thus, economies are irreducibly complex systems in the context of the tools available to humans, QED.

Also, its worth it for the coffee shop to take a risk that you're double spending on that cup of coffee because: 
* A.) Its hard to double spend, and if you were able to do so you'd probably abuse the power in a more dramatic way.
* B.) Even if you do, they're only out one cup of coffee, and you're out however many millions/billions it cost to build the computational power to do it. 
* C.) Its worth the occasional lost cup of coffee to move people through the line quickly. They probably lose more from chargebacks and fraud, presently.

Thats... an excellent question and it exposes a hole in what I know of colored coins that I didn't know existed. 
I'll have to learn more about how colored coin ownership is transferred. I might be totally wrong about this being a viable idea. It might require a trusted server to administer keys, unfortunately.
I've got just an intuition that its possible to do trustlessly because of Electrum's hierarchical deterministic wallets... but a more technical mind is required here, I think.

So, brainstorming now, what would an effective POS system require? I'm working with the assumption that some sort of "insurance" (like credit-card backup) would be required to make merchants feel comfortable with people walking off with their stuff.
What about this: combine something like the Square card readers with the standard phone-based bitcoin-wallet payment system. The sales clerk would use QR-code process to initiate the bitcoin transaction, the run the customers credit card through the reader as backup. 
Of course, this might make the *customer* plenty uncomfortable... what means would they have of disputing a credit card transaction if the backup were used and the bitcoin transaction did in fact go through?

You're correct about what a colored coin is. My suggestion is merely letting the private key that lets you spend that colored coin also be the key that unlocks the encryption. 
The idea would be that you can download any of these encrypted files, you just need to buy the key to open them.
I agree on the futility of paywalls, but I also do believe it's good and healthy to afford creators some measure of protection and a means of earning rewards from their work. It would not be fool proof  but it would take out some middle men, and hopefully it would be cheap enough that consumers at large would just choose to pay rather than circumvent.

I'm moving to Seattle next week to work for a company that sells books and stuff on the internet!
I've gotten into Bitcoin as a result of a basic distrust of the monetary system. I was looking into buying gold circa 2011, the first time I've had surplus capital to try and protect, and I ran across Bitcoin. Sadly, I decided to wait and see how things worked out before buying into it, so I bought my first coins a week or two before the big spike this spring. I've also got a BFL preorder on its way, and I've been invested in ASICMINER for a month and a half.

As opposed to, like, the time I logged into Scottrade and bought shares of United Airlines, then got a letter a couple weeks later saying my shares were canceled because the airline filed for bankruptcy (I was young) ? My first finance professor put it starkly: "Stocks are promises to deliver nothing." 
One of the most interesting things about this whole bitcoin economy phenomenon is the instances of people trusting each other not to be thieves, despite lack of any regulatory assurance; and that trust being validated (at least in some cases). Especially when you've got securities with acronyms like TAT.ASICMINER (Think As Thieves). Its comical.

Granted, Japan's got its problems. But if that's the extent of the damage of a deflationary spiral, who the fuck cares?

I think your question is more focused on why its a bad idea to borrow money in a deflationary currency, correct? The other commenters answers are insightful, but focused on colored coins as ownership certificates, which is mind-blowingly awesome but different from your concern. 
To address your concern more directly: there's no reason you can't peg your contract to anything else. Just say: "I agree to pay X dollars worth of BTC on the specified date."
Bitcoin will be volatile until it gets big, and until then its probably wise to structure contracts in such a manner.

So, the artist distributes encypted copies of their work via bit torrent, then sells the colored coin with a key to unlock the encryption. Some scheme of cascading keys would be required.

Seems pretty good, but I'm having trouble figuring out how BitPay helps with the doublespend/verification time issue. Is BitPay taking on that risk? Or are they doing the "card-backup" scheme? This seems like it would solve the problem, but it essentially requires BitPay to be acting as an intermediary, something I thought it was desirable to avoid.

An ominous point: "Satoshi Namakoto" stands to be the single most powerful economic entity on the planet by orders of magnitude, if this thing flies.

I've just started with the bullion-buying, in addition to bitcoins. I see it thusly: Precious metals are a hedge against society collapsing and taking the internet with it. Bitcoins are a hedge against society collapsing and somehow not taking the internet with it.

So... they'd buy up all the coins? That sounds like great news for the market price. Your contention is that they could literally buy /all/ of them, refuse to release any of them, and this crash the bitcoin economy? I suppose this could be true, but it would still amount to a massive transfer of currency to holders of coins.

eli5: an artist can send his work to everybody on the internet, through "bittorrent". But he can lock it so that people have to pay him before they use it. He locks his work with a key that also locks a page in a special book called the "blockchain". He can sell copies of the key to people, and the copies are called "colored coins." Each "colored coin" key he sells is a little bit different, but because they're very carefully made they can all unlock the artist's work. 
I seriously just made this shit up; no idea whether the technical details would work out.

I also tried to buy some hotsauce, but MtGox's payment tool was fucking up, and I gave up. 
I spend it as if it were fiat, and replenish it immediately with fiat. I figure if I just buy btc as the same time I spend it, I'm not really exposed to currency fluctuation. As long as Coinbase is executing orders, anyway.

Read F. A. Hayek. Austrian economist; nobel laureate, not a bad line item in your bibliography. There are collections of his essays here: 
Hayek talks a lot about the role of money and markets in civil society, and has some very interesting thoughts on the price mechanism as an information processing system. TLDR: don't try to outguess markets.
Also read George Selgin, particularly this:
He's alive and working now; that paper is unrelated to bitcoin except that it examines the argument that deflation in necessarily bad and provides a compelling argument to the contrary. 
Note that both will be considered very biased sources; they're definitely a minority voice in the current environment.

I had a fun time recently explaining to someone that the vast majority of US dollars, or any other paper currency, have never been printed. They exist only as records in ledgers. In that respect, they are exactly the same as bitcoins. The only difference is where the ledger is located, and by whom it's controlled.

I've made quite a few purchases through them, and aside from being constantly out of coins to sell, the system seems to work pretty well.

New proposition: a fund for suckers that get screwed by randsomeware. 
How it works: people with lots of BTC to spare donate some to an address, which is used to pay the ransom for tech-illiterate windows users who get their shit hacked and can't figure out how to get bitcoins in time. The donation to the victims is coupled with some educational material on security and a guide (with a disk) to setup and use Ubuntu. 
Why: Excellent PR for bitcoin, and it actually helps the people who are getting fucked. Also excellent PR for non-windows OS's.
That said; I don't personally have enough to donate to such a thing; all of mine are purchased and I already feel like I don't have enough. Surely early miners are in a different position, though.

It would take months, maybe years. But the certainty that it is happening would be enough to make the currency grow to a point where it could be stable.

When prices decline to the point they can satisfy their desires with their capital why not? This is the purpose of economic activity, afterall, the satisfaction of desire. Sexy, no? 


This is the first instance I've heard deflation being referenced as a cause for medival European wars. Frankly the premise seems suspect.
