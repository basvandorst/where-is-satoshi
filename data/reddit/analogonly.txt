is BitcoinClassic a thing, because I had this idea, no segwit, small blocks. lol

I'll also take this guarantee, in fact, I will bet it will continue moving to the right.

CoinYe has $0 value. It is a dead crypto.
Maybe somewhere someone would want to give me something for it, however I would need to hand them the wallet as the network is no longer alive.

who uses this over blockchain.info?
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:46:46
I understand. My point is same looking packaging, pre-made keys,and hardware that looks and functions the same. I'm not saying everyone would be duped, just enough people to be tricked. Sold from an  "Official Authorized Dealer" looking website, not ebay.

Anywhere you are given *free* electricity... it's really only free up to a certain amount, eventually landlords and the like will realize the over usage or abuse of the amenity and take it away.

It's only going to get worse. China will make clones of these they will look and act exactly like a ledger. People will be fooled. As crypto gets more valuable there will only be more bad actors, bad software, and bad hardware.

~~Baht and Bitcoin have the same symbol, FYI..~~

Sometimes you need to put in an order which may take a few days to fill.. people don't always realize this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:07:48
I'm going to disagree here. I think for companies/entities doing business transactions over $1m in amounts across country borders it still is a fantastic means of exchange. Let's say I am doing business with a company in China (B2B) and they need the funds ASAP. Well Bitcoin provides huge transactions in a couple of hours (compared to DAYS for ACH, and probably even longer for transactions over $1m) Not only that, but the fees are still incredibly low for such a transaction, and the amount of paperwork is zero.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:59:52
About that government blockchain thing... It sounds centralized as fuck. Sure if anyone owns more than 51% of the network, they can do whatever the fuck they want -- it's no longer a trustless system. So it would be a wasted effort to reinvent the wheel only to be a fiat currency with a centralized blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:08:56
Agreed, to me that's why Bitcoin has value. It's not speculative, it has utility as a blockchain, which gives credibility and trail for transactions -- something we've had to trust in agencies which boil down to people who are human; susceptible to error and corruption.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:03:04

Haha, it will never have value, that ruins the point. However you're right, 20 * 0 = 0.

im  confused on what you gave me, this is for tUSD (Fake/test $5?) 
..because I think I just wasted about 10 minutes collecting fake $60.. lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:56:38
Salty. I wonder if they'll change it once BTC pops back over 19k..

i've only got 2000 or so :( i need them to test my apps bro.
Also, testnet faucets that ive found have run dry..
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:44:02
OP has over 3m USD in BTC if he dipped 1m during this correction. I'm going to guess OP has somewhere around 200 BTC. That said, OP I hope you have about 200m USD worth of BTC in 2018/19 :) 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:27:31
Yeah without a 2nd layer you cannot reverse transactions, this is accepted in  crypto as being a compromise. But specifically I was talking about a downloadable good (widget). But your shipping address can be different from your billing. For example lets say you have a PO box or want to ship to a friend. It doesn't have to be the same address as your billing address.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:15:26
do you know what the fee table looks like for segwit transactions?
In contrast to this:
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:21:03
First off we're not seeing 50% drops. The point is it's an exchange of value at the time. If the person is willing to accept BTC they know the risk.  Also quite possibly they're not looking to sell for fiat.. you know that's the whole point of this right? You don't have to go back to fiat, BTC has value.
EDIT: of -&gt; off
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:14:16
I continue to disagree that it is merely a vehicle for speculation and has no utility. That is simply NOT true. The blockchain offers all kinds of utility. It removes the human factor from accounting. This adds undeniable value as a trust-less system. The cost of human error and corruption is by many means indescribably large and influential. That's where bitcoin, decentralized cryptocurrency, gets it's utility and supports value.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:15:14
Doesn't blockchain offer something we don't have now?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:58:00

I know for a fact that some blockchain startups/companies give the option for their employees to take their salary in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:11:33
The better experience is  not having to give a merchant your personal information. The value added is that in identity theft. Specifically for credit card verification and account numbers. Or in the case of paypal your email address and your credit card/address information. Crypto takes that guy out of the picture completely.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:33:47
Especially when half the exchanges you trade on maybe gone tomorrow... what do you do in such a case?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:32:45
until that merchant takes BTC, why not?

Also the fact that she hired her own daughter, but I guess there's nothing wrong with a little nepotism, right?

@_date: 2017-12-26 20:19:47
Why not both? -- Ok... I like blackcoin,  it's got 1 minute blocks and is PoS. (my point is i think there will always be a crypto economy, you will be able to pay in your crypto of choice as long as there's liquidity or the merchant is willing to accept)
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:09:21
What are you talking about? Maybe you didn't read my initial comment. These are INTERNATIONAL value transfers. Companies /Corporations need to pay taxes to their respective government as part of their corporate tax dues for doing business.  Some countries don't have such corporate tax obligations.

i think this has changed since then as 'bitcoin:' is a protocol used by clients to send and receive coins. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:42:38
Since KYC is something exchanges in the US must comply with. The policies for implementing KYC is controlled by the exchange/company and not the government. So it's what they see fit for them in terms of gathering KYC information. If people use lots of money to buy drugs and sell drugs and these exchanges are providing people with that money, the exchanges can get into trouble, so it's in their best interests to comply with law and cover their asses by implementing some form of KYC.

I was tipping, im dry - i gave out a lot of BTC in tips. Theres another tip thread going on, and there will be more in the future. But if you have some tips you've collected you should 1. spread them around the rest of reddit 2. start your own tipping thread.

I was thinking licensing could easily be handled by the Blockchain, as it shows ownership. While it would still be difficult to outright stop piracy it could be used as a means to make sure copyrighted material can be only viewed by those who own it.

this is an important question, I am a software developer and if i write any code that pertains to the transaction of a crypto currency, am I a financial service provider?
To me it's like trying to regulate email. If you write an email client/server that makes you an email provider. But we shan't do this to email providers.

cool stuff - 50 bits @_date: 2014-06-13 04:33:47

@_date: 2014-05-13 01:29:12
I agree. After my thread today, a good number of people should have some tips to spread around. I gave a couple outside bitcoin today as well. Felt great!

If you can't afford it, maybe a little tip here and there can help :) 400 bits @_date: 2014-05-16 19:37:33
It's easier for me to give you a tip, mostly because i've recieved tips -- i think its good to build up some tips to give out/pay forward -- just for sake of having connected to your reddit account. If i were to donate I wouldn't be giving you a few bit cents :) more in the realm of dollars
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:10:28
But depends on the coin.

@_date: 2014-04-20 01:35:22
Use bitcoin client/wallet to send/receive, not an exchange. The single only reason they do off Blockchain transactions is because there is no way for the Blockchain to support the speed of high frequency trading required by the exchange.

Exchanges need a real ACH provider because banks don't like doing business with bitcoin exchanges. If you could somehow invest in a ACH provider that will appeal to Bitcoin Exchanges, they won't have to worry about banks dropping their accounts.

Woah, I think crypto currency in general would be at risk. If anything the alt coins are way more susceptible to 51% attacks just because they are new. I think the people who do the attack wouldn't want bitcoin to crash.

A lot of exchanges only require email verification, as long as USD/Fiat markets are not concerned/traded. I don't know how easy it would be to enforce but I'm sure they could do it, so people should be reporting their accounts as necessary. AFAIK, IRS looks at bank account holdings as a way to monitor what an individual is gaining/owing, but since there is no identity tied to a cryptocoin wallet address, this is seemingly hard to enforce but a lot of data can be collected.
Edit: impossible to hard

sending to a wrong address accidentally isn't very likely, as invalid addresses will be rejected by the Blockchain. But there IS protection, it would not be difficult to implement this kind of option, asking the person to verify one more time before sending.

I doesn't. 1 bitcoin can (right now) be divisible 8 places. This just means that people will likely be having satoshis to use. OR even more likely, the protocol is adjusted for even further divisibility.

Yes at the moment it's not 100% there as a currency, you can wait a year or two until adoption really takes a foothold. However, getting in now will still make you an early adopter, and the value will likely have risen by the time you can spend it anywhere.

Not good news for anyone really. Malware can infect everything from a mobile platform to a Banks network. Don't think so?

Our tip sizes are higher though :) I think we should make this a daily thing if possible. As long people pay it forward and we keep an eye out for leeches I think we could successfully spread to other subreddits.

Yeah, a lot of people don't claim their tips. I give 2-5 days for them to collect before I cancel. People do collect though, just keep spreading it around. Eventually more people will catch on.

Trading on an exchange is usually off the Blockchain. Also most exchanges trade fee is something like 0.05%. Bitcoin can be transferred from one wallet to another for FREE on the blockchain, you can post 0 fee transaction, it may take a couple of days to go through, but it will. The point of a transaction Fee is to ensure your bitcoins go from one wallet to another quickly.

Special Tip Amounts
ChangeTip is pretty flexible on the amounts you can tip. You can use a currency amount like 1 or 1 BTC. You can also have some fun and send amounts like 1 beer or 2 coffees.
Here's a list of all the special amounts you can use.

Why are you selling it? Usually people sell things they see unfit for themselves anymore (or they're strapped for cash).
 If it seems profitable enough, why not just buy BTC with the profits?
@_date: 2016-03-30 15:57:59
Most wallets allow you to backup your wallet.dat onto a USB. It's best to encrypt it first (in case it gets into the wrong hands)
and then back it up.
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:27:24
Yes, that's exactly it, it protects it with a passphrase and is encrypted with it. I use the  original (but updated) bitcoin wallet, it asks me for the passphrase whenever  I need to receive or send coins
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:27:04
I think the seriousness comes when the value goes high. people take things more seriously when there's more at stake (money wise).
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:22:10
That's the gamble, buying the BTC.
@_date: 2016-03-29 20:51:02

Get the FREE networking pass the only difference is that you're not guaranteed a seat at the talks.

you must have the majority of the coin, that's a lot to ask. In fact it is much easier to gain 51% of network hash rate than it is to get 51% of all the coin available. I will probably get downvoted but I see PoS as a way more elegant solution than PoW, the atrocious waste of power aside.

@_date: 2017-09-15 01:21:48

You didn't have to. I'm allowed to state my thoughts, this site allows that sort of thing.

Who is forcing them to take their losses? You only really lose when you sell. I still have the same amount of BTC than I did before this crash.. In fact people should have MORE coin if not the same amount of coin. Now's the time to buy not sell. Or just watch :)

Can someone explain to me why this one isn't way higher up? Is it because running a full node takes too much space? I've been using the Bitcoin Core wallet since 2011 and haven't been happier. 
That said, I run it on its own harddrive with a prune argument to make syncing a little quicker.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:47:19
SMS isn't good 2FA. This was declared by NIST since 2016 that SMS is compromised as email. You need logic based 2FA not communication based 2FA. Rolling number based on time and key is a million times more secure than a code 'sent' to a phone
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:37:19
No one is denying that the price is falling "bro".
death means the end, no more interest/support, infrastructure around it dies because no one uses it, no longer supported.
I personally am incredibly bullish on BTC, I like what I see from what the LN has to offer, and am currently growing my number of coins. My porfolio looks like it did in November.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:15:52
if you think this is the "death" of Bitcoin, you and they are mistaken.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:53:05
At that point a house would not cost 300 btc. only 1 million people could have at most 21 BTC (in reality there probably will only be about 16-12m coins because of lost/destroyed wallets). Of course there would be loans, companies whom own coin would give you a loan and operate the same way a bank does. Or you would pay a mortgage in the same way the only thing which is different is that it's coin and not your checking account. The banks are worried because it doesn't have to go through their ACH it can all be done on the blockchain easily -- this means no accounts for them, no fees, no investments... they're shit out of luck to have to compete with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:32:20

@_date: 2017-09-18 15:11:36
I'm going to play devils advocate and say -- you could fat finger a wallet address and then you'd really be fucked for the coin. At least with the bank there's infrastructure to get you back your money. Send money to the wrong address and you'd better hope 
 it's a valid address 
 the person who owns the address notices and is generous to return the funds. 
The first  is incredibly, really almost impossibly small chance and then if that goes well, it's a lot better of a chance  happens.

When a bitcoin start up becomes a major player, and the service they offer is that of a bank, they are doing the protocol a disservice. 
The whole point of bitcoin is that you DO NOT NEED a bank, you are your own bank. 
Somehow this notion has been forgotten, but it is one of the utmost pillars and reasons bitcoin even exists. 
DO NOT USE THESE BANKS.

@_date: 2017-07-26 16:05:33
But this isn't in the US, some countries don't have the same laws. Not saying this case is exempt, because it very well could not be, just saying the same laws do not exist everywhere.

Yeah, it would be incredibly dumb for an administrator or owner of BTC-E to commit a crime with the very business that supports them.
