Nope, [still *her* money](

I find that *extremely* hard to believe, but I'm not in the US so I'm not as familiar with that particular situation. Even if that was the case, I live in a country where the government has openly and blatantly tried to conceal the level of inflation, and trust me when I say that *everyone still knew how much inflation there was*.
And I deliberately picked a high point for BTC because it goes to show how unreliable it is. A basis of any working economy is a steady and *predictable* level of change, which is what BTC never had and doesn't seem to be getting any time soon.

Worse than North Korea? Worse than Syria? Worse than Venezuela? Worse than Ethiopia? Worse than Chechnya? Worse than Iran? 
If you really think that the US is worse than any of those countries, you *really* need to get out of reddit for a while.

How much inflation was there, exactly? Because anyone who bought BTC when it was around 1k lost way more purchasing power than anyone holding that same 1k in greenbacks.

Yeah, continue taking major financial decisions behind your wife's back, what could possibly go wrong?
Seriously dude, get a fucking grip. Don't sacrifice your marriage on bitcoin's altar. BTC is not worth that much. Nothing is.

Just "possibly"? Putting all your eggs in a single basket is never a particularly brilliant idea.

Exactly. It's a lot easier to imagine that the investment you have put a lot of time and money into is unstable because *They* are out to get you, than to entertain the idea that you have made a bad call and sunk a lot of time and money into something that might be a poor investment.

And yet, wars have been going on from before *any* of those four thins began existing.
It's almost as if people are going to be cunts to one another regardless of culture, creed, or monetary system.

Number of murders alone proves nothing. If Country A has 1 million inhabitants and a thousand murders per year, and Country B has 50 million inhabitants and 1,500 murders per year, technically more people were killed in Country B; but that doesn't make Country A the safer place to live.

Actually, the government enforced restrictions have caused the existence of *several* exchange rates that make the issue even muddier.
First you have the official rate, that it is only for show and taken seriously by pretty much no one at all. About 6.20 ARS per USD as of today.
Then you have the rate for exporters, that is, Argentinian industries that sell stuff abroad and are forced to convert their earnings from USD to ARS. Said rate is about 5 ARS per USD, I think.
Then you have the credit card rate. You can buy stuff abroad with a credit card at the official rate, but then you get slapped with a 35% "because fuck you, that's why" tax. You can in theory get a refund of that tax, but you have to jump through so many bureaucratic loops that most people won't bother. This tax makes it an unofficial rate of about 8.30 ARS/USD.
Then you have the "real estate" rate. Houses in Argentina are sold in dollars, you see, so people wanting to buy any property have to negotiate a price in ARS with the seller. This rate is not as fixed as the others, but it tends to hover midway between the official and the black market rate, so let's say about 8.50 ARS/USD.
And then you have the black market rate, the euphemistically called "blue dollar". This is currently between 9 and 10 ARS/USD, depending on the day.
At a glance, it seems like the real rate is probably around 8.4, but the government is trying to make it look smaller so that they don't have to officially announce a devaluation of the Peso.

Since you mention Argentina, the USD ban send the black market rate sky-high, which in turn makes it nearly impossible for people in the middle class to exchange any significant amount of money to USD.
You can't stop all of the people with a law, but what you *can* do is make it inconvenient enough that most "normal" people won't even bother to try. Which is what OP was talking about, it seems.

It is high when compared to an average salary and disposable income (as in: if you want to buy any significant amount, I hope that you are not planning to eat for a day or two). You are absolutely right that the official rate has been kept artificially low for too long. 
On the other hand, I seriously doubt that the "blue" rate is that much "voluntary" or determined by the free market. The rise or fall of the USD rate in Argentina carries a *huge* political weight, and those greenbacks have to come from somewhere. Just because the government can't manipulate the blue rate, that does not mean that no one else can.

Through traders of dubious legality and repute, at a rate so obscenely high you might as well just light your money on fire and call it a day?
