You don't seem to understand how a nonce works. Simply put, if you can hash the entire keyspace in a short time, a nonce is useless. The only way this would work is to not publish the nonce in advance, but that would render the "allow attackers to verify their result" property meaningless.

I don't think logic (or history) really bears this assertion out. What we repeatedly see is that as power becomes concentrated into few institutions, the damage that would be done if even one of them took the 'selfish' strategy you're referring to would be catastrophic.
Here is a lesson from computer science: ["At the heart of the method [of Amortization] is the idea that **while certain operations may be extremely costly in resources, they cannot occur at a high-enough frequency to weigh down the entire program because the number of less costly operations will far outnumber the costly ones in the long run, "paying back" the program over a number of iterations.**"](
In other words, the 'resource cost' of failure will be lower if we spread the risk among the entire group instead of concentrating risk into a possible failure case that can be catastrophic.

Fair point. If the regulations are sane, that's one thing. However, our officials need to really tread lightly here as they truly have no conception of what is actually happening. Most people can't even frickin buy digital music if it isn't on itunes, and we're talking about one of the most innovative and deep technological innovations in history here.
The prudent thing to do is start with a VERY loose grip and tighten it as needed, NOT the other way around. IMO.

The one thing I have to mention is that for Linux users 'monitoring downloading tor' would require that all package repositories are compromised, since that is all done in a cryptographically secure way, and you transfer your requests over https, meaning that you can't decrypt the Path (e.g. /ubuntu/x86/tor) requested from the repository.

You didn't offend me. You hinted at it yourself:


There is no Evil Force consolidating power. It's just humans being humans. Humans fail a lot. People get victimized, and the power structures crumble. Spending too much time obsessing over this just isn't healthy.
I agree with you in that we should do what we can do on a personal level - in fact that's all we can ever do.
I'd just like you to consider that the same urge that makes people paranoid, afraid and 'needing to be secure' is the exact same humanity you're trying to protect yourself from. Those in power feel the exact same way - they believe they have earned their position in life (no matter whether they haven't, that's their reality) and will stop at nothing to protect it.
They (and you) will always fail to lock things down 100% as always. Try not to let it get to you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:06:19
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:43:02
The big thing you miss is that the current throughput of the network is not at all required to secure it. The network could be secure with many less miners, but each miner mines because they're making money by doing it.
It's inane to say $66/tx when the miners building the txn blocks are profiting. I'm not sure what you aren't understanding. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:10:17
No offense, but the second half of your reply betrays some ignorance of the true history of this country. People had to FIGHT and DIE for things like worker's rights. You think 40 hours a week is a lot? Again, people DIED to bring it down to that (still insane) level.
"Things will fix themselves" is a fantasy. Things only "Fix themselves" if you consider that people going out on the street and throwing things when they get fucked over to be "fixing itself".

I think it's pretty obvious that you fear the potential of escalation of tyranny or aggression or whatever. I'm not trying to call you out by saying that, it's not exactly an uncommon idea.
What I am suggesting is that you are creating escalation by taking this position. If you look at it on a macro scale, this kind of behavior will be destabilizing, the powerful say "we must take control" and spin and spin.

Soon is a relative term in this case. We're at about a 5c/GB storage cost at the present. This will inevitably fall even further. With the blockchain hovering around 13GB, the cost to store the blockchain is currently roughly 65 cents.

Just saying you don't have to "keep money in an exchange" to randomly pull the trigger on buying or selling btc. Once you get verified you can buy/sell whenever you want, and it will lock in the price at the moment you did so (though actually transferring the funds will take a few days, but that's the banks' fault, not coinbase's).

Yes, and it is possible for us to meet each others needs with vast amounts of surplus. We can still even reward people who go 'above and beyond'. How much do we reward them? That's the open question. Right now we put the ceiling on infinity but does that actually help us for vast piles of capital to replicate out of the hands of anyone actually using it for something real and not just making money off money off money for no reason?
Why don't we say massive tax for all income &gt; 10m, and all that tax gets pooled and split evenly between every local government? There are many ways we can have our cake and eat it too.

It is demonstrating what is called a '[double free]( bug in the bitcoin-qt client.
However, what it is not demonstrating, is how this error occured. I could go in and start thrashing the memory of my application to cause a bug like this to 'appear', or it could even appear if I had corrupt RAM. This doesn't prove anything, only leads to more questions.

This is good, but the PHP library he's using is digesting md5 hashes, which is much too small to hash addresses without collisions (as that topic you linked shows).

Addresses (where value lives on the blockchain) are public keys though. Access to the wallet is access to the public keys, but value can only be moved out of those addresses by signing the transaction with the private keys, which they can't do.

Basically an API key is another private key... bitcoin private keys control access of your funds, API private keys control access to a particular service.
If you got my coinbase API key you could send commands *as me* and steal anything I had in there, as well as executing a 10k buy order with my linked bank account, etc.
If you are not a developer you should never ever even think about touching that key.

It's not impossible, especially within "clever" code. It's just the kind of thing that you hope will be caught (eventually).
See no one (serious) in open source is going to make the freedom/security tradeoff. We all know that fundamentally nothing in the universe is 100% certain. However the risk model is much better with something like open source than a private tree belonging to a corp. Think *you* would see when they put backdroos in there? ;)

The whole 'non-internet connection' thing is basically assuming your system is rooted. This is a theoretical concern; programmers and techies tend to be very completionist.

Basically bitcoins are only a number in a database... but that database is global and distributed, so no one can cheat.
The *thing* that you have is not *a bitcoin*, it is your *keypair(s)*, the public half of which is published to receive funds, and the private half to access/spend those funds. Your wallet is simply a list of keypairs you have generated.

I'm glad you acknowledge that. As long as we value people by their productivity, we will fall into this trap.

Shit, sorry. I was reading October instead of August. My bad.
The shitty thing is that it appears that dwolla locked them out of all that at this point, but it still should be on CampBX to credit you the $50, because they should have issued a refund if it was an issue with their Dwolla account (with your $50) being locked.
I'd encourage you to keep trying, I personally have dealt with a fair amount of usd going in and out of that exchange (before the whole Dwolla closing... I'm now waiting for them to get ACH support) and never had problems, so I'm inclined to think this is just a misunderstanding somewhere along the line. Sorry about misreading the dates you posted!

No one develops 'revolutionary technology'.
What tends to happen is you have a glut of hackers everywhere, hacking on something they like, for free, with no thought about money a lot of the time.
Then someone comes along and *combines the work of many others that have been done before him* to make a 'revolutionary technology', then capitalizing on it.
There's really no point arguing this with you because comment after comment reveals that you simply do not "get it", and you are so centered on MONEY MONEY and REVOLUTIONIZATIONS to understand how geeks actually make the world you see around you.

The amount of development cost that goes into something like that, if you were just going to straight up pay someone else to do it, is probably way more than you'd think.

Again, I think the only reason people would say "off the hook" is because there are so many counter examples of people who do worse who ARE off the hook... not that this is necessarily objectively the correct outcome. Know what I mean?

@_date: 2013-11-28 17:50:57
What we need is for users to be able to *jointly* create addresses, and *jointly* sign transactions in order to spend from them. This is likely already possible today though I do not know all the details. I said 'naive' for one thing. :)
Alright, let's say seller is selling an item for 1 btc. Also, seller is S and buyer is B.
So what happens is S and B create a joint address with the properties I mentioned above (neither can spend from it without both keys), and a joint transaction (same property, both keys required).
S sends 1 btc to the address. B sends 2. If seller never delivers at this point, S has lost the equivalent btc in price of the good, so gains nothing by cheating.
If shipped and received by the customer and incorrect, then of course there would have to be a discussion. I'm not engineering away the human element here. **The point is, no one can cheat without incurring a loss that makes that behavior irrational**. Hopefully you get it this time!
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:52:51
