Really? So here any clicking noises when moving the cable around? Someone else in this thread said they were also experiencing it.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:33:11
I understand that. I was wondering more in terms of where would development go.
@_date: 2015-12-02 03:25:35
Nice! I guess they must have stopped doing that.
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:14:34
Awesome! Thanks! I got Armory but I'm a bit confused on its purpose. To enable online-mode I need to run Bitcoin-QT. Doesn't QT do everything that Armory can do?
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:37:52
lol dude. I don't believe I did. I'm getting pretty disappointed that the quality isn't on par. It was $120 after all...
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:58:38
Wow. I'm hoping it's a safety feature or something instead of a mistake in the production.
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:26:04
I was confused about that as well.
@_date: 2015-12-02 18:05:05
Thanks! Just found out you're right. I guess nothing is loose inside.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:43:51
I started using MultiBit and I love its simplicity. I'm not that sure of how secure it is. I do like the idea of having a bitcoin client on a thumb-drive. There was this one wallet called [Ledger Wallet]( that seemed really cool.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:50:42
What's your problem dude?
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:24:24
Makes sense. Seems like the fees are where they make the bulk of their money.
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:51:21
Yep. Does it make any clicking sounds though? I'm not sure if I'd qualify it as a slight wiggle or not.
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:08:03
I saw the serial too when updating the firmware. You sure that it wasn't an old video?
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:18:34
Awesome! I heard about this on This Week in Startups a bit ago. Looks great!
@_date: 2015-12-02 18:07:46
Some people here seem to also be getting two cables. I wonder if Trezor decided to cut back.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:13:32
I will. I don't really have much Bitcoin since I've only started a few months ago. It's easy to use, yet seems to be super secure. I can't see any type of software being able to break into it. The people behind it even say that you'll still be safe using it on a virus-ridden computer.
@_date: 2015-12-02 03:03:47
haha, ok. You can never tell on reddit:)
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:44:18
Ok, so I'm not alone. IMO it doesn't contrast that well with the device. Do you notice any looseness in the micro usb port by chance?
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:30:16
Yep. A new one is on the way:) Everyone seems to hate Trezor's supplied cable. I just wish they were more honest about what color I was going to receive. Pink was definitely a surprise.
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:26:55
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-12-02 03:26:03
They must be getting a hell of a bargain on these cheapo cables.
@_date: 2015-12-02 01:04:49
haha. Those sneaky bastards...
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:44:34
Haven't heard of it. I'll have to look into it.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:14:53
That's strange.. Good show though! I'll probably check out their other episodes as well!
@_date: 2015-06-04 23:37:10
Trezor looks interesting. Haven't heard of a "hardware wallet" :D
BreadWallet also looks cool. The issue I have with it is that you can only access it from your phone. I was hoping to have access both on my computer as well as my iPhone.
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:50:50
I'm not trying to say this in a sarcastic or mean kind of way, but why are you here then if you believe it is only destined to fail?
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:53:06
Good point.
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:18:09
@_date: 2015-11-25 01:00:23
What a dirtbag. How do these people sleep at night?
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:16:35
lol! Thanks for the heads up:) I feel like 21.co has good intentions. They are definitely not a flat out scam like BitPlastic. 21 seems to have a lot of tutorials and information which is good.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:07:24
:( Thanks for the link though. I'll consider it. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 01:01:08
Out of curiosity, how did your site not get destroyed by the DDoS?
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:46:57
hmm. I had quite the opposite with customer support. They answered me right away(less than 12 hours). Are you in the US? I'd consider myself 1/0 with purse.
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:08:45
Thanks! It seems like everyone is leaning on the Trezor side of things.
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:59:21
I'm not sure if I'm missing something. What does this thing do that a regular computer can't? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:25:56
Nice! So it would work with Multibit HD?
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:56:25
Thanks for that!
@_date: 2015-11-27 20:44:13
Props for that detailed post! The last thing I'm wondering is that if you can use multiple software wallets (ex. myTrezor and Multibit HD) to manage a single Bitcoin address, or if I have to stick to one wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:00:53
My bad. I thought you worse talking about wins and losses. Isn't that how this works?
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:44:50
Fair enough. I guess the beauty about Bitcoin is that there is a very small transaction fee and it happens immediately.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:05:53
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:16:05
It would be easy enough for them to do. Probably the only way for them to profitably mine coins besides moving to China.
@_date: 2015-11-17 00:50:13
Didn't know there was a difference. Sorry man.
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:11:34
Interesting. Do most stores near where you live have Bitpay, or something like it? 
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:30:25
@_date: 2015-11-17 00:50:40
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:13:29
haha. I've seen worse forums.
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:24:47
I also heard it is the most tested. Currently my hardware wallet is an encrypted usb flash drive with Multibit classic installed on it. It works fine, but if I lose the drive (or the password to the drive), I lose everything.
