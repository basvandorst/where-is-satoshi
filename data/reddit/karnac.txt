If your transactions are below $12, call paypal and tell them to turn on the micro transaction rate for your account. $0.05 + 5% per transaction. you have to call them, as far as I know there is no way to turn this on yourself.

my fealing is that the whales are waiting for the market to bleed out before buying in. also, the April 15th tax deadline is forcing the small, crypto-dependent guys to sell.

you cant inspect encrypted traffic.

the problem is that the majority of this market has no idea what crypto is or why they need it. the good 'ol dollar is working just fine for them so why would they investigate further? the entire crypto movement is still in dire need of an easier way to acquire and spend crypto. the xapo card is a step in the right direction but I don't think it will be enough yet.

I receive a small amount (~£10) of British Pounds and (~€5) Euro's into PayPal every day from a separate business. I would be willing to sell them for BTC instead of exchanging them for USD.
PM me if you are interested.

If you don't want it, then send me the 40 bitcoins that mysteriously vanished out of my MT GOX account. 18avhuPJEHoEg7hzGB6wg123bHKxu9PcFd

not true. this entire game is about speculation. If the value of a litecoin increases in the future, it was always profitable.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:03:46
so, you want them to present a false facade... yeah that's never gone wrong for anybody.
we don't want bitcoins to explode to the point of threatening any pre-established currency. that will only enrage the governments of the world into action. we need bitcoin to be slowly accepted into the collective consciousness of anyone that uses money. and that means we don't need slimy CEO's or PR managers to come in and "corpratize" the shit out of bitcoin. the value speaks for itself to any half-brained, literate person.
@_date: 2013-05-05 18:55:02
isn't that the basis of capitalism?
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:32:54
a loss of 700? on exchange fees? how much are you trying to transfer!!?
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:37:34
who the fuck gives a shit about the guy not wearing a suit? honestly, you'de think you were from the '30s. If he's comfortable and not exposing his junk in a lude maner, why does it matter? oh i get it, you don't want to be associated with the polo-wearing riff-raff.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:35:45
awww did you not buy in early enough? disgruntled a bit? 
seriously, why does everyone want this to fail? the market itself may be an issue but bitcoin's inherent value is not a bubble. the ability to send currency to anyone with a computer is the true value, and that will never go away.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:58:40
people understand dollars. the value of btc is obviously constantly changing.
@_date: 2013-05-05 12:34:55
no, because I make 3 times as much BTC when i trade up. also, you're probably not one of the professionals.
@_date: 2013-05-08 15:39:01
its not money they understand. they don't want to understand it because its not what they're used to. its making other people money which is also not what they're used to. Bill is the only one nerdy enough to have looked into it himself.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:40:08
people are literally throwing money at this company. they don't need shit other than a team of elite security consultants.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:42:53
why? because the guy at the top is a super-nerd? would you rather have him or some snake-tongued CEO that has no idea how to do any of this stuff, getting paid huge checks to sweet talk the hords into buying...
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:33:20
try again, my database started filling up, not sure if it was already an issue or if someone just did something. everything is up at the moment.

i think you mean $300k to $1M OUT.

as long as your password is pretty secure and unique you should be ok.

they don't. we had to take all BBC content off in 2010.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:31:37
yeah someone just uploaded that because of his recent death. I'll probably be taking it down.
@_date: 2013-05-05 08:14:30
and this is why we mine litecoins and feathercoins people.
@_date: 2013-10-21 04:37:23
thanks, done!
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:09:46
yeah you don't need to buy another one, your account on mixriot still has download privs. 
thanks for supporting freshlymixed! ha

i mined over 1000 btc and sold all for rent between 5 and 15. fuck.
@_date: 2013-05-15 06:57:21
this shit is retarded. its just confusing the people that come here trying to figure out what a bitcoin is.
