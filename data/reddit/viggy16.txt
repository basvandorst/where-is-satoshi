On the same front page, we have a person who got incredibly rich off Bitcoin donating 86M to charity and a person who would like to mislead the public for personal financial gain ... this is stupid.

Completely agree with all of that! All I’m saying is that the OP said ‘Bitcoin’ is at $17. Bitcoin will never be at 17. If the title was milliBitcoin is at 17 - I’m completely good with that
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:21:25
Completely unrelated ... If you would like to change the Bitcoin protocol to give everyone who holds 1 BTC, 1000 instead, you can gladly go ahead and reduce the price to 17. 
Of course, there would now be 21 billion BTC total. This is as dumb as saying - ‘Hey, let’s say 1 meter is now the same as 1 km so that people feel like they are traveling much faster’

That was a very incomplete article - US M3 money supply is at 10 trillion and just the NYSE market cap is at 16.6 trillion. Bitcoin's market cap is just 8 billion. Stating that the black market is the only way for bitcoin to succeed is a very rashly thrown together conclusion.
Cash is not inherently catered for the black market, yet it is their current currency of choice. Anything that offers advantages over it will get adopted by the people who see its value.

I have to disagree, that is definitely still sloppy - technical analysis has taken on so much subjectivity that everyone now attempts to pass off lines on a chart as mathematically and technically based.
Point 1 - Your Fibonacci retracements have no point if they do not correspond to critical elliott wave inflection points. EW works in lock step with Fibonacci. Regardless of whether EW is reliable or not, simply counting lines is not sound.
Point 2 - If a diagonal is neither leading nor ending and unidentified by anyone except yourself .... witchcraft.
Point 3 - EW is meant to encapsulate market emotion. Bitcoin trading is too fragmented and too controlled by a few large players for it to accurately represent the emotion in the market (maybe in the higher/highest degrees) but counting sub-waves is about as productive as picking a stock based on which ticker would score the most Scrabble points.

The transaction fee stays for people who are buying Bitcoin but is waived for people using this model since the merchant is effectively paying the fee. The ACH processing cost can be bundled into the overall merchant fee and the consumer wouldn't have to pay an additional costs now. I am willing to bet that on volume, Coinbase could reduce their fees to make it very lucrative for merchants.

Love what these guys (and gals?) are doing!
Lets stretch goal the shit outta this. 
Btw, while I am all for paying for things with BTC, if there is a viable way to do it - refusing to support something that is eventually going to forward the eco-system because the only viable crowdfunding platform doesn't support it ... is ridiculous.

How does Coinbase send fiat to the merchant. What is the transfer mechanism?
Isn't our argument for bitcoin that it is a far superior value transfer mechanism than any other existing options? It is the most efficient way to do the 'sending'.
@_date: 2014-04-13 15:24:36
But this would be the first step to that. Coinbase already offers all 3 services (fiat to btc conversion, consumer to merchant transfer and automatic btc to fiat conversion). They would just need to consolidate it and now the border between fiat and Bitcoin is gone. People would be paying in Bitcoin using fiat.
In order for the ecosystem you desire, bitcoins have to be bought for fiat at some point. Reduce the consumer side fees by offering this service and creating volume. This creates a feedback loop where merchants get a higher percentage of their revenue via btc, higher profits lead to higher adoption and higher adoption leads to some merchants holding some proportion of their revenue in bitcoin, hence creating the ecosystem.
Plain and simple - Volume creates adoption.

Appreciate your stance but I feel like the Bitcoin community would benefit from your involvement in helping make sure they write a factual article, as opposed to attacking their journalistic process.
Yes they might have misrepresented Erik's comments but what is to stop them from just saying, "Bruce Fenton declined to help us make sense of recent developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem."
People who support the technology of Bitcoin need to support and explain its growth. People will always knock it down and misrepresent it but it is our responsibility to clear up misconceptions and keep promoting it. By the most aggressive estimates, less than 0.04% of the world even has a bitcoin wallet, 0.02% of world has atleast $1 of bitcoin and only 0.005% of the world has even 1 btc.
Promote bitcoin and let people make up their own conclusions. That (in my humble opinion), is what would be the best we can do for it.

People not interested in Bitcoin aren't using it anyway. This is meant for people like you and me who are interested in bitcoin but believe it's value will rise significantly in the future and don't want to spend it now. This allows us to simultaneously spend and hoard bitcoin.

In a regulatory environment where most countries are wary of Bitcoin, we should be grateful for anyone and everyone who is adopting BTC. Also, the more relevant story would be if BTC helped these companies turnaround on the strength of the efficiencies of the Bitcoin network.
The biggest argument we make for Bitcoin is that it allows for super efficient, near-zero cost money transfers. Their adoption by these 2 companies is the most logical step for a company looking for a competitive advantage - not the sign that Bitcoin is relevant. Their return to competitiveness through Bitcoin would be the more relevant headline and that is enough reason for us and the Bitcoin community to support these companies.
Last statement is pointless. There is a big difference between Overstock/Zynga and B&amp;N and JC Penney. The latter were brick and mortar behemoths beaten by not adopting to a massive disruptor (internet) and the former(Zynga/Overstock) are products of the internet era, looking for a saviour in the new disruptor (bitcoin).

The problem with that is that we are getting blinded by this extremely libertarian vision of replacing fiat. Fiat will not be replaced because we dont like it, it will be replaced because a better option slowly gains adoption and promoting this in any way possible (via a focus on its technology) is key. 
Having the banks on your side, making them use it as the technology for their transfers will eventually lead to the replacement of fiat.

That seems like some sloppy Elliott wave work. II was way earlier in July and I prefer 3 wave declines (which if true would be confirmed with a break of 400).

I am glad you took the time to watch 'The Men who built America' but the quote was about how 3000 mistakes were needed to learn 1 right process. It is neither in support of nor is it a vilification of anything Edison did.

Price per sqft in San Francisco is ~$1000. A lot of regions in Mumbai go for 100,000 INR. So you can either buy 6 sqft or a Bitcoin in SF OR 4 sqft or a Bitcoin in parts of Mumbai. If Bitcoin isn’t India’s game, then it has no business being Venezuela or Africa’s game either ... and you can buy fractions. Really silly comment

So, when the bounce of 10+% happened at 8 pm in China and then hit 3700 (20+% bounce) by midnight China time - all the Chinese traders went - welp, its midnight now - time to sleep?
'When China wakes up' is the most ridiculous thing that this sub loves to repeat.
