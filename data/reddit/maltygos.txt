the other way it is need it though.
make government transparent using blockchain technology and descentralization for third world countries is a thing urgently needed.

if you read the white paper you will see the current bitcoin is not the dream people have for it at 2009, while bitcoin cash  'seems' to be.
fact is, neither is the dream. bitcoin pretty much abolished its use as currency while bitcoin cash is almost centralized (mining-wise) 
pd: both subreddits are cult-like, as of now i don't see a subreddit related to cryptocoins that doesn't have its own cult. number-wise bitcoin cult is the new Catholicism though, while bitcoin cash is orthodoxy

you or your friend are missing something.
mining process blocks, nodes verify that those blocks are ok.
if there are no miners there are no blocks, no transactions.
is it possible to do  something diferent instead of proof of work(bitcoin mining)?
yes, proof of stake, proof of capacity and many more
 each has its merits and demerits.
can we make it without any form of proof?
theorically yes, in practice it is nonesense, it will be hackable, corruptable or centralized
is mining centralized? 
hard to answer.
as of NOW there are few companies that make asics for bitcoin mining. making it something like "anyone can mine but few can make the equipment for mining" 
there will be new companies launching new equipment, will they be expensive ? yes, making this centralized too.
it was also centralized in location too, but this change with chima regulations

it was the benchmark, you are right about forcing though... how long brute force will allowed them to keep doing it , it is the question.
sure ,south america will follow (some countries already lose the battle here though, so we are 'in the lead')
but others will give crap, giving another reason to weakened the already weakend dollar

well bitcoins support 8 digits, fees sure is a critical hit but hey... deciding between high fees and having no 'valuable' money is not that hard.

@_date: 2017-11-02 13:17:08
i would keep some coins because they have future, but i pretty much side with your thought.
using $6K from your wallet to get 1 bitcoin  it is a heavy toll for average joe, but if he got that money from alt coins is a heavy damn profit (ofc investigating the coin, the white paper, review of others that are investing is a must too, and even then it is risky)
i met neo at $1 and qtum at $5, i regret not trusting my research XD
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:27:38
well bitcoin was supposed to be use as currency rather than 'stock'
somewhere, sometime, somehow it changed...  if it is for good or not... it is too soon to tell
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:27:07
eth, bch, neo etc.
those monsters support almost anything
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:14:53
i think you can format/reset your wallet though? why don't you try it? if it gives you the same seed... you may have found something interesting
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:42:52
actually all exchanges are fk up...

that dude is high honestly...
when i read those kind of comments, it really scares me...
some weeks ago i read here about bitcoin was not meant to be use as cash... he got like 300 votes... which i felt it was atrocious
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:57:37
any recommendation?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:26:57
i saw another post like this 5-6 hrs ago, except he did it in english and in russian, i believe this is some sort of scam/pishing
or gold/karma seeker?
bad place to do that
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:46:19
it is amazing how btc has proofs of mods from here using vote bots and mods are personnel from blockstream.
and here at bitcoin have proofs that they are scam
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:05:38
how did you get that link? man finding there something is hard xD
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:46:45
BUT lets ignore decentralization in the process so it seems.
also the 'you can use the side chain/off chain if you want' sounds like a third party to trust too, and if you don't use it well... pay 50$ to make a 10$ transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:55:34
for people in usa kinda, isp will be doing crusade to search anything related with crypto currency websites and fk it to US citizens.

how do you get bitcoin with cash then? you are not giving an answer...
the only way i see is localbitcoin or bitcoinatm
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:03:40
IDK... irs labelled it as property, yet fbi arrested people saying it is illegal transactions (as currency). Bitcoin right now for the government  is what gives them money...

i will read its white paper tomorrow

oooh ok now i kind of understand its pro.
are there any case of manipulation? (like with conventional ATM?)
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:44:48
don't invest everything into crypto currency, invest what you can afford to lose.
now if we stop talking about investment and more gamble, you can gamble all. just see the chart of this year, it skyrocket but it has its bad times too
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:13:58
was eth considered ponzi scheme at its time? (truly curious here)
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:31:22
can you tell me how pls? hoe about other traders?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:47:48
the trust behind of each other is the difficult part.
or there is no problem so far with that site?
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:11:15
that intermediary (centralized) offchain thing? honestly i think it will be the perfect tool for governments to control crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:48:29
thanks for the detailed answer.
sadly coinbase  is not available for my country.
i am looking into cex.io

spain will survive but it will be a free fall of their economy making all their projects and expectations to dust...
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:25:42
man and i thought it was a good site...
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:40:51
i only read bad reviews from them... well i read ONE in an ocean of hate hahahaha, and it is a recommended exchanger for my country... fking hell
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:43:19
can you give me your opinion with this one?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:56:06
yes i know they block it if you move the money, idk what is the next step on their part. but honestly if they took money from my account i want it back that is another reason i gave it back (cuz karma is a bitch)
but the flaw is there
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:47:09
with the almost possible fork.
do you recommend to buy now or after fork?
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:13:47
kinda late with ln though
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:22:59
so for my country (peru) a recommended trader is bitex.la  , i did a quick search in reddit  and i find its last update was 4yrs ago.
its main site is also kinda doubtful too.
anyone that used it so far? (this year)
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:37:40
seems pretty standard for the sub to me
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:59:19
in my country is 8.8% but locals tells me it is still good even with those fees.
what am i not seeing?
if i use cex.io (example) for less than 5 BTC it is 0.2% transaction fees and 3.5%+.25$ for deposit and 3.8$ for withdrawal right? i do not understand the margin trading fee yet though but those number seems lower than .3%  but adding them does not add up to 8% in fees...
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:48:35
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:21:58
did you stop using it? or did you try a new one?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:40:17
you will be making bank transfer? this part is confusing me
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:11:56
the machine at your location is £ to BTC and BTC to £?
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:56:26
and the fast transaction is likeable...
yeah always forget that.
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:50:19
will you keep using them? if not which exchanger will you try now
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:50:08
hmmm interesting 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:57:08
the system either takes or gives cash to your account. once it gave me over 20K pen, i freak out and call the bank immediately (when they notice the error they fix it, so i didn't want to have problems. it reward me with some cash though)
i know some cases that the system takes money out too (not hacking)
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:41:36
yes, that is the site i used to find recommended traders, the 2nd best option is bitex-la, but... you can see the first comment  to find me issues with that one
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:22:06
under usa law bitcoin is not a currency, same as mexico and other western countries...

@_date: 2017-10-31 00:29:13
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:19:02
yes, it is actually easy...
while i am against cryptocurrency back by governments, the need for a fast way to make trade prevail in a daily basis, something that cryptocurrency  doesn't have today
another point, not everyone has the ability (keep their wealth safe for an easy example) or wealth (just doesn't have the money for either equipment for easy access or the network is costly) to get in the network as easily as you do, forcing you to keep using fiat
point one can/will/may change in the future, point two... never, the entities with power at that time will do their best to keep that wall, and like the people of today (people agreeing it is ok to regulate cryptocurrencies becauae of terrorist) people of that time will think it is ok, because of terrorist (or worse, they will not care because they are poor and can become terrorist)
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:03:27

@_date: 2018-04-02 14:15:32

@_date: 2017-10-30 19:16:35
well trump is president... that give you a simple straight answer
people have been fighting against fcc so far it proves useless, and that issue has decades unlike bitcoin (that it just gained motion and awareness)
sry to say it but the america dream is not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:44:41
are u talking about bitcoin or bitcoin cash? or any other crypto?
as of now barely any crypto is used as a currency...
