You want a currency to be inflationary  otherwise there's no incentive to spend it. This is a primary reason why bitcoin is an awful currency. If the dollar in your pocket gained value over time then you'd think twice every time you went out for a hamburger or coffee.
I'm a bit concerned that you're the one educating politicians on this topic.

Holy shit, that was a real knee slapper. You got any more zingers?

So you want to force your changes and worldview on people that don't want it? Top lel. Why should other people accept change just because you want it? I sure as fuck don't want this shit you're pitching, so would I be within my rights to resist it with any means necessary?
Maybe if you could provide evidence of a successful, modern, developed libertarian country it would sway people to your method of thinking. But you can't.

To reiterate:


Your opinions and ideals are so perfect, so amazingly well thought out, that literally zero modern and developed countries on earth has established them for their governing system. I was going to keep arguing with you about how you're wrong (heh, you even said "I want to change the place I am in"), but I don't need to. Because you already lost. We get our way and you don't get yours. You will never get yours, because your ideas are outlandish, impractical and impossible. You're out in fantasy land while we reside comfortably down here in real life.
Toodle-loo.
