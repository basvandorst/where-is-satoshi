BIP38 can protect you against physical theft (or private key theft).

As I said, in order to steal your bitcoins an attacker needs:    
With brainwallet : Your passphrase, which is difficult to create a random one.    
With BIP38: Your private key AND the passphrase.
Also is faster to perform a brute force attack to brainwallets than to BIP38.

English is not my language,  maybe I didn't express it correctly. 
Nobody but you should know the passphrase.     
What I meant is: you can derive several brainwallets per second (it's a relatively simple process), but it's harder to decrypt a BIP38 wallet.
You can try it by generating a BIP38 in bitcoinpaperwallet.com and then decrypting it.
REMEMBER: the amount of time spent to decrypt it increases with the lenght of the passphrase.

Exactly,  now think about this:
Brainwallet: you use "I have a long passphrase" to generate the key.   
 Now I create a software to *guess* passphrases and derive the key (note that it can be done several times by second).    
In that scenario you don't know I'm trying to steal your coins and you're depending on the randomness of your passphrase. 
BIP38: you generate an high entropy key (bitcoinpaperwallet.com , real dices, etc), then protect the key with "I have a long passphrase" and finally you print out the paper wallet.    
 Now I need access to the paper wallet, (wich should be safely stored) and then I need to guess the passphrase (this take about 30 seconds per try on a regular PC).

Bitcoin (con "B") es una red descentralizada que mantiene un registro de transacciones. Al igual que internet, no tiene una autoridad central que la controle.    
A través de esta red se pueden transferir (enviar/recibir) bitcoins (con "b") los cuales tienen valor monetario (unos 330 € por unidad actualmente) con la misma facilidad que se envía un e-mail y sin que nadie pueda evitar esa transferencia (se puede obviar por completo el sistema bancario y las restricciones al movimiento de divisas).
Cada bitcoin se puede dividir hasta 8 posiciones decimales, con lo cual es posible transferir prácticamente cualquier suma de dinero por un costo aproximado (y fijo) de € 0.05 (cinco centavos).

I didn't read that book, maybe it supports your previous statement but keep in mind it's an apocalyptic book and the author is trying to sell it.

Indeed,  you can't go to a bank and get USD freely.  
You need a high salary and an authorization from AFIP (kinda IRS) in order to exchange your ARS at 9.1/USD.     
Business also needs that authorization and need to declare why they need the USD.    
If I,  as a regular citizen want to buy USD and get cash I'll be charged an extra 35% tax, to avoid that I must leave the money in the bank for a year. 
Another option would be to buy USD on the black market at approx13.60 ARS/USD  (google "dolar blue")

What would be a "negative mark" on someone without banking history?, I'm sorry for being insistent but in my country someone in the situation I described could go into a bank, open an account for free and get a debit card without mainteinance fees.

Well you catched me, I don't have financial experience or training to argue that. But, if you look at the last 3 days on btcchina, they are cashing out on Western (GMT) night, so all of us woke up with a $10/15 down since last night. And newbies might feel fear and sell off their BTC because of fear. That's my point, is it a bear or a bull trap? or maybe no trap at all?
