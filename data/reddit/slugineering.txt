Sounds like he was day-trading trying to minimize losses for that to happen. 96% is an extreme loss, and seems to be just exaggeration for effect.

"paper losses on his initial investment have reached 96%"
Either he is lying for tax reasons, or fake news. Even if you bought at 20k, you'd only be down ~60% from peak. Unless you constantly bought highs and sold dips.
Every day I lose a little more faith in journalism.

You're under sampling your data. Nyquist would be so mad.

They could sue every major exchange.
The real money isn't in lawsuits, its in the settlements. Any decent patent lawyer will tell you, its cheaper to settle for hundreds of thousands, than invest millions in a multi-year court process.

Sue exchanges to provide bank account information for fiat -&gt; crypto. Then connect the bank accounts to users. Many use exchanges to convert.
My point is... don't rule out these people's greed.

It doesn't, this just opens up the possibility. The jerks I was referring to are doing it in other industries.

Probably more patent trolls just trying to cash in. Parasites.

Depending on the text of the patent, they could sue users.
Google "The Patent Scam." And check out the documentary. The author got sued for posting an App on Google Play. His app didn't infringe, but disseminating via Google Play was what he was sued for. "Why wouldn't they sue Google?" Because users are easier targets. It garbage, but that's what these lawyers do, they go for the low-hanging fruit.

Not just submitted, approved. A bunch of shady patent lawyers are setting up shell businesses and suing people for patent infringement, settling out of court, and receiving average settlement = $300,000.
Then rinse and repeat.
They're called patent trolls, and I think they're garbage.

That's what these jerks are doing. Just because it's legal doesn't mean it makes sense. :(

You'd be surprised. 
Patent for "Method of swinging on a swing." Issued in 2002.
