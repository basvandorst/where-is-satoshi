Speaking truth to power!

I'm both saddened and happy with the number of bootlickers proclaiming "just pay your taxes, it's the price for the society we live in" as the reply to this post.  
It tells me that Bitcoin is no longer only a freedom-lovers' interest, it's out in the mainstream.

Good luck finding each of them behind their Tor connections.  
Cops &amp; government workers are naturally extremely lazy.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:24:45
I disagree.  
Taxation is extortion.  
Down with the (nation) state.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:25:50
Amen.  
Death to the State!

Taxation is theft

Obedient slaves make me puke too... just ignore the stupid.

Chyna who?

I'm a libertarian, not a pacifist.  
I employ all tools at my disposal to destroy the enemy, and yes, including the lazy stupid brainless shameless sadistic government goons.  
So stop fucking around with MY bitcoins.

Thank you.  
As a libertarian I appreciate you standing up to the fakes and weasels, control seeking politicians (only paying lip service to liberty ideas, much like most recent country leaders have done) this space is sadly becoming full of.  
Fight the bastards, down to the nuclear option. Save our Bitcoin.

I don't see how it would be any different from Bitmain today: running factories, mining farms, pools &amp; the Bitcoin,com propaganda site.  
On second thought - it may be an improvement :)

I love it!  
Shows this psycho is full of shit.  
He was pumping Btrash five seconds ago... and now 2X in the same breath :)

Very butthurt individual

Erik has kissed the ring years ago. When they squeezed him for gambling and he paid up. Now his ShapeShit co is happily working with every 3-letter agency on coin tracking.    
Calling him "anti-government" is laughable and stupid.  
Words != deeds.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:38:34
Won't be the first time :)
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:00:54
Roger Ver loves 2X more, all of a sudden?  
He's doing a disservice to Btrash...
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:43:51
You must think I'm a pacifist?  
I will absolutely destroy the enemy using any tool available to me.  
(Wondering whether the state should exist is irrelevant here, but I love discussing that too).
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:51:47
I hear there's this used computer parts dealer that wants to give you 1 BTC for each S2X token :)  
But be careful - he's a known liar and often backs out of deals.

I will absolutely use any tool at my disposal to kill the enemy. I'm no pacifist.  
We can talk about the government's role in the world right afterwards.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:46:27
The state goons are a tool I have to defend Bitcoin. I'm using it.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:45:02
I will destroy the enemies of Bitcoin using government if convenient.  
I will destroy the government a second later given the chance. :)
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:58:09
No, I use them to kill the immediate danger: the 2X crowd. Right now.  
Talk to me in December about the role of government.
