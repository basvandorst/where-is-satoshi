If you see another person after doomsday, the least you will want to do is kill him. Moving in packs is your best chance to survive. Division of labor, different set of skills, etc.
You have no chance all by yourself.

you would have to compare the density of golden tickets to the density of nonces. 
I wouldn't know how to do that.

the other person already has his buddies with him, you can join them or kill them all, what would you say is best? I'd stay with them and be stronger together. Others prefer to play rambo, to each his own.

which theory? and who is "we" in "we should be able to dissolve them", who is them? when you think deeply about those things, you realize that there's no "we" or "them". There are only individuals with different interests.

they had, that's why America is the wealthiest country in the world and Russia is so poor.

I can't tell you how many times I hear people say that things that happen to them are so unfair, yet they fail to see all the wrongs they make. I guess it's easier to see that in others.

It's a common misconception that because pi has infinite number of digits in the decimal expansion, it will contain all possible combinations. That is actually not correct. Irrational numbers doesn't necessarily have this property. 
A couple simple counter-examples:
0.101001000100001000001000000... irrational, never repeating but only consisting of 1's and 0's.
Another counter example is take number pi and remove all occurrences of digit 2 and it's still irrational, never repeating but lacks all strings on which there's the digit 2.
