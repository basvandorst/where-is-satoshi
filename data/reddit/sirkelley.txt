Go for it!
We look at the Robocoin Ambassador program as a great way to get people from all over the community engaged in Robocoin Operations. 
Thus far, people see Robocoin ATMs as bitcoin's onramp to the masses. The more people involved, and that means people who may not have the bandwidth or capital to operate, the better for bitcoin! 
We're really excited to move forward with this program. We've already seem some amazing Ambassadors yielding incredible sales on every corner of the world. 
Welcome aboard!!!

Couldn't agree more. The more RoboCoins in the market, the faster the proliferation and thus demand and usefulness of Bitcoin.

Hey Buyersbitware. This is Jordan Kelley. CEO of Robocoin. I'm so sorry to see that you're displeased with the Robocoin Operator Model. 
The Robocoin team has spent the last year dedicating our lives to not only provide the masses the easiest access to buying and selling bitcoin but providing operators around the globe the most profitable bitcoin business opportunity. Our first operators broke even in less than one month. No plug and play franchise opportunity in history yielded Robocoin ROI. It's historic. Robocoin is the simplest and most scalable way to create and grow a bitcoin exchange business. 
We provide operators the best service and have always looked at our relationship as a true partnership.  After understanding the unprecedented economics of this business and furthermore the incredible amount of work that it takes to ensure constant up time for each Robocoin operation, we believe this is an incredibly fair deal that enables operators the ability to grow their business to great levels. 
We are really excited to start shipping hundreds of Robocoins around the globe. We have some awesome operators that we are really excited to work with. Most importantly - we are proud to be the onramp for the masses to the bitcoin highway.

The first REAL ATM. There was never an ATM in Cyprus. Jeff Berwick was ousted from BitcoinATM after a dispute with the founder ( I have no reason to believe that they are still developing.
