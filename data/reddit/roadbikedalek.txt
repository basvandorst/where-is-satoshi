A relic of linear forums, a  “big thread” just doesn’t work very well on Reddit. Once the tone has been set by a few top comments, the rest tends to get easily lost.
There’s a trend to have big threads and I really dislike them. If it really gets bad, then even a new subreddit would be preferable.

I enjoy all the good that our tax-based society does. From sewers to affordable health care and from street lighting and cycle paths to disability benefits.
Perhaps another system could work, but there’s plenty of reason to support a distributed currency regardless. I’m getting a bit tired of the political ideas that people want to attach to Bitcoin.
(edit: I’m Dutch but I suppose the same goes pretty much everywhere)

A recent block triggered a bug in Bitcoin-QT that makes it give an error message when starting. There is no fork or anything. A patch is in the works.

The nonce here is essentially a guess for a variable in an equation that miners have to solve. Generally you just try 1, 2, 3, etc.
When people count, and they get up to 9, they add another digit to the left:
    …
    0 9 8
    0 9 9
    1 0 0
    …
Computers can count up to 255 before they need another “digit”, or byte:
    …
    0 255 254
    0 255 255
    1   0   0
    …
However, only some computers (notably, older Macs) count that way. Most computers actually add digits to the *right*:
    …
    254 255 0
    255 255 0
      0   0 1
    …
This aspect is called *endianness*. Computers that count like humans are *big endian* (adding digits to the left), whereas computers that add digits to the right are called *little endian*.
