I can only dream of doing a 180% turn

how about a good old raspberry pi?

Bitonic is amazing. It's just instant conversion with iDeal. Would recommend to fellow dutch people. Heard it will be availabe in belgium too soon, if it isnt alteady.

Note: This party is still very small, so it probably won't have any impact.

Every bitcoin exchange other than Gox have been selling their bitcoins at remarkably stable and uniform rates.
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:49:55
Many people advice against leaving my bitcoins in onine exchanges, but I do it anyway. Still have them.

Welcome, have you bought any BTC yet?
+9 doge verify
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:13:58
Yes, but the bitcoin is entirely independent from the dollar, if the dollar crashes, the bitcoin won't. investors from all over the world with all sorts of currencies have influence on the exchange rate of the bitcoin.

I really like how dogecoin is a wow such fun way to introduce new people to cryptocurrency. It would make the step to use another currency such as bitcoin easier, it's always good to expand our communities.

Bitcoin in Uganda. Sweet.

How many coins did you lose?
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:03:09
I've heard cryptocurrency is really bog in Cyprus, what is your estimation of the percentage of people who use bitcoins locallly?
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:44:39
Is this ?
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:46:08
Why is this terminology so confusing
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:40:52
Interesting, stories of people getting goxed over a year ago
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:25:21
bitcoinwisdom.com for an overview, And I watch the kraken.com charts because it's the exchange I use.

" the price of the bitcoin is inevitably based on the price of the dollar" 
Looks like he has no idea what he's talking about

I like to say newcomers are still early.

Those are some very corny tshirts...

I genuinely wish the best to the gox team... Potentially a lot can be done to restore the dealt damage, but it depends entirely on their capability.

Dont ever let "he is old" be an argument.

Bitcoin messiah!
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:12:39
This is the solution we all hope for and it would be the best for everyone, though it wont be an easy fix
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:48:51
Well personally I don't mind so much, but we're a pretty large subreddit, and many people own, or have interest in the bitcoin, and because of our common interest, it's best to have top posts that show positivity and would be inviting to new users, because that's what we want right? This is supposed to become the global currency !
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:38:48
I've been advised to never buy a prebuilt miner.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:12:20
Shoutout to Bitonic. Very easy to use, a slightly higher fee than at other places but I recommend it to any fellow Dutchman. (And soon Belgium too iirc)
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:25:58
Uncertainty isnt a crime yet, they have to work hard on creating a solution to an insanely complex problem.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:27:22
It's all up to the bitcoin community to start things up themselves. Starting now you'd get a lot of free publicity
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:21:40
Thanks a lot
