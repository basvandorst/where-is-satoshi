I have a shop setup with wordpress and woocommerce with BTCPay as a payment processor. It's actually pretty easy to setup, I used a VPS for the BTCPay server so I don't have to keep a computer online all the time. I only accept Lightning payments since my prices are really low but you could easily add onchain payments.

So this kinda backfired. To anybody that opened a channel, bear with me here. Gotta move more BTC to my node to fund the channels :) Haven't synced the blockchain in a while so this will take some time but I will open a channel with all of you.
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:25:19
Channel buddies, lol.
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:33:34
I'll connect back :)
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:51:15
I opened a channel back :)

I'm not sure if that's the case. I installed this on my girlfriends phone, after I funded the wallet and the tx was confirmed the app started to duplicate the wallets and after reboot the wallets and BTC were gone.
I'll check tonight on her phone if what your saying happend.

My girlfriend created the wallet and she said the app didn't tell her to remember shit, but she is not experienced with bitcoin so it could be she missed that part.

Thanks :)
When I try to open a channel with you I get:
 \[lncli\] rpc error: code = Code(177) desc = Multiple channels unsupported 
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:27:07
I'll open a channel with you tonight.
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:02:46
Thats true, but I can open a channel the other way.
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:48:27
Thnx :)

That's not what he means, when someone opens a channel with you, your side of the channel is 0. In the future you'll be able to fund your side for a channel somebody else opened.

Yes funds are definitely gone, it's ok though it wasn't much.

Eclair wallet is my favorite (you won't be able to receive payments) but you need a well connected node to make payments across the network. If you don't have a node you can use mine to open a channel with, it's pretty good connected and online 24/7, most merchants are reachable.

I don't think there is a recovery option if you do not back-up? It didn't get a recovery phrase / words / seeds or anything.

Cool, now go spend some satoshis [here]( :)
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:25:17
I let her do it cause I wanted to know if noobs could make it work on their own, definitely not the case :) 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:37:14
Thnx! I'll create a channel back when I get home later.
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:53:04
Nope, I'm BitStock.
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:35:52
Make sure you have back-ups of your wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:25:57
Thnx, I'll open a channel when I'm home later today.
@_date: 2019-01-08 13:27:19
lol, just saw r/SorryForYourLoss Don't think my .006 BTC loss is worth the mention ;)
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:33:07
Me too, but I just tried to open a channel with somebody and got this:
\[lncli\] rpc error: code = Code(177) desc = Multiple channels unsupported
Don't know why you can connect 2 channels with some peers and not with others.
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:30:22
Lost my BTC with this one, so beware.
