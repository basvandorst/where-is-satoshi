Is someone using a quantum computer for this?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:11:40
Using the Btc as a value. :)

Fast money means short waiting time,People want to make hay while the sun is setting
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:09:07
Please wait for a few days... the prices will fall badly
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:19:08
Bitcoin is correcting itself
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:10:42
What if it were done discreetly
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:59:05
Lying to elderly is easier!
@_date: 2019-04-09 10:01:02
Flip phone is a piece of shit?
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:16:28
So around 1/10th of price should be bought?
Along with checking if its damaged or not
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:15:31
When can i have 1 satoshi for 1bitcoin transaction 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:43:43
I did study some business and a bit of human psychology in college.
Anything that goes up at this rate has to come to a crash.While we can discuss all technicalities we can but in the end its about the human experience and real emotions.
@_date: 2018-03-28 05:56:22
Fully secure?
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:25:26
Well most people are ignorant about bitcoin yet throw in their money,There should be answers everywhere
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:37:32
1 satoshi for 1 brc
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:39:06
Will it be forever?
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:17:54
One Emp burst
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:00:20
But tx fees.... That's a kind of middle man too
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:34:54
I bet you that bitcoin will touch 2k
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:48:44
For the Wall , Taking money out of bitcoin is the bonus they were talking about earlier this year
@_date: 2018-03-10 09:10:53
Freedom to ask questions...Its important
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:03:08
Oh... click and find the answer...
btw the questions will keep the pro people know what people think daily
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:17:08
The bonus for the wall street people was bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:09:08
Sometimes hours can last longer than years
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:04
The only hope is the barter system
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:57:04
Bitcoin has to go through all stages to start growing again
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:50:54
Now the market will be flooded with cheap GPUs.
Oh' my gaming brethren buy when there is blood on the streets
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:34:03
I have  a very very bad gut feeling about the future of bitcoin...it may fall to 2k before touching the moon and then it will be back to earth again....
I'm just worried about the delay once it hits the peak..maybe on the first breakout of 35 k I'll sell whatever and see it Hit 67k and then its a downhill
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:56:18
Its something like a bubble in foam.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:53:36
10 is easiest.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:33:18
Wont it lead to more anxiety?
@_date: 2018-04-10 06:55:35
Its like worrying about a sandcastle when a tsunami strikes...
But quantum computing is something which is growing rapidly and almost everything digital may go down
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:59:26
Was not bitcoin meant to free people from wall street and similar bodies?
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:18:41
Is it a kind of Schrödinger's cat?
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:29:49
Truly studip
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:33:07
Till then its a comfortable life?  
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:03:13
I don't know..... It was fun initially but I ran away from Cryptos once it played with anxiety. Its not worth the long term stress and worry.
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:20:40
$ is a symbol for currency which is used by people to buy things like lambos in the ancient 21st century...
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:23:52
Should it have been *Raw emotions?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:07:55
So YES bank said NO to crypto currencies
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:33:15
I am not trolling yet...
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:21:42
ehh the carbon emissions
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:35:15
But why was not the SI system changed so far. It could have made things much easier
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:40:51
A few cryptos will rise while most will fail
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:39:36
The same thing what happened to other currencies will be repeated and then eventually bitcoin will become what fiat is and then something will replace bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:34:08
Try touching upon the human aspect of greed and how it has affected bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:55:46
How long does it take for an average person to earn 1000$ and how long will it take for the same investor to lose 50% of his money if he had invested in December?
 No statistics will help to calm a person who lost his money, And most new investors want 10℅ takeout monthly. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:41:57
Malleable 
@_date: 2018-04-03 08:49:42
They are 4 wheeled wagons which run on petrol
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:02:40
I propose Tree coin!
Would be fun to have an alternatives to cryptokitties
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:16:36
Never apologise for such reasons
In the end its all about good life
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:37:27
Was it logical for bitcoin's value increase so fast?
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:39:30
So that bitcoin can be used as a base currency of earth network
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:35:04
All hail our saviour
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:18:19
Too complex for the ordinary people
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:35:40
It does not happen that way
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:33:06
Why but? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:33:14
Asking the right questions
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:12:07
I have not yet faced biometric scans while refuelling or buying phones.. That's quite a strange allegation
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:19:36
3% of my investments shall be cryptos..whenever it goes higher than that,Ill throw the extra bit in the retirement fund.
I think ill just play it safe and postpone the stress to afterlife
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:06:40
How have you been? 
Life gets better... Stay amazing human!!! :)
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:24:08
Well its not compulsory...
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:26:38
You put too much faith in the intelligence of the crowd
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:31:02
Which kind of mental toughness
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:54:03
The ban is there...The traders can trade virtual currency between themselves but not with the govt or its channels. 
The sell price is currently 5k  and the buy is around 7k in exchanges in India.
My calculations were wrong, The sell is 5.2k and buy is 6.7k
