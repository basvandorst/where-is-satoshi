I don’t believe you. But in the slight chance that you’re telling the truth, congrats.

I know exactly how you feel! 
A friend recently asked me about Bitconnect seeing how its price has gone down. 
I facepalmed. I have explained this before. How can people not see the bleeding obvious?
One Bitconnect is still just one Bitconnect Nothing changed. Bitconnect is well-defined. It is what it is and nobody can do anything about it. It is set in stone with a fixed supply schedule. It's an immutable protocol.
My face was red at this point. I was agitated and pissed off. (As you can see, I would likely be a lousy schoolteacher.) I continued:
It's your closed-source centralized Dollar/Euro/Yen altcoin that moved with respect to Bitconnect!

You’re extremely lucky. Don’t let it get to your head.

what makes you think this correlation will continue?

Maybe you’re right, bcash was the catalyst that started this but as of now now Bcash’s 24 hour volume is only 108 million. Bitcoin is at 4.5 Billion.

Yes. You’re crazy.

I agree many useless projects will die because of this, but to say all alt-coins are going away? That’s not realistic at all. There are other projects with solid use cases that will carry on and thrive.

No Bitcoin IS crashing and causing all the others to crash along with it.

Good job decreasing your daily screen time ��

The money and the tech. But guess what? Talking about the price has literally no impact on what will happen. It’s a waste of everyone’s time.

Saying that mining is less destructive than other industries doesn’t mean it’s not destructive. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:02:43
Yeah, you should definitely sell it all.... ��

Definitely a better investment than Powerball, but financially free at $4 a week? Let’s be realistic. Maybe $50-$100 a week at these levels for several months will net you financial freedom years from now.

What are you talking about? I agree with you on every point. Based on my comment what made you think I want to ban money or transportation?
