Yeah that is what I am thinking, however it does bring up the issue of Bitcoin vastly changing in value before they have received their product. 
Because of this, I think agreeing on the price AT the time of transfer might be necessary (whether that be before or after the time customer receives product).

just as a heads up (bc I heard Dropbox mentioned ITT), you can enable 2FA in Dropbox as well. 
as a side note, if you do decide to leave a backup on Dropbox I would make a true crypt file container for it.
however, personally, I could only sleep with my savings in freezing cold storage with BIP0038 encryption on the private keys.

If a study were to come out which showed that age was correlated with technological knowledge and ability, would it still be considered stereotyping? Sometimes there is truth behind stereotypes, and to be evasive to that stereotype would equate to being evasive to the truth. It is apparent that the stereotype in and of itself does not make Buffet's conclusion wrong, but it does further to highlight the reason the stereotype exists. Making light of the stereotype could serve to motivate those who are not knowledgable about new technologies to educate themselves before making conclusions. I think people are overly concerned with being politically correct, and important discussions are out on the back-burner for the sake of "politeness." Is this the pinnacle of human intelligence?

I agree, but you must consider the idea of an equilibrium. A rational consumer may realize that exploiting a short term edge may cause their long term EV to decrease. In which case, they are not benefitting from a seemingly profitable short term play. I admit, my post was appealing to emotion; however, a bit of rational deduction highlights that short term equity (avoiding small fees?) and long term profitability (network stability / security /countless other positive aspects of BTC) become out of balance.

Maybe I am missing something obvious, but if a method to withholding from pools came into existence, wouldn't all pools begin to suffer from the same problem? More than likely, people would be driven by greed and withhold blocks REGARDLESS of whether the pool was acting "morally." 
Eventually, miners would raise fees until they could still profit, leaving us back to square one. Except it would be a little worse than square one, because the whole idea of a mining pool would be compromised.

Senior in computer science here. Absolutely enthralled with Bitcoin, and really want to contribute in some way. I really feel it is one of the most important things I could be doing for the world. 
However, Bitcoin Core is a hugely complex system and o find myself overwhelmed with the source code, and am obviously less experienced and knowledge then any of the core devs.
How does one "get over the wall" so to speak when it comes to contributing to something like Bitcoin? By wall I mean the feeling of your inability to contribute/understand the subtleties of the system. And how long would you suspect that takes?

OK since every other thread is going to be ridiculously crowded I'll say my piece here. This story of hers makes no sense. She claims that she happens to find two police officers walking up to Satoshi Nakamotos house? How is that timing even possible? Did she get a lead from the cops? Almost certainly not. Secondly, why would local police officers care about Satoshis involvement with Bitcoin? There is nothing "criminal" about it in the sense of local law enforcement. If anything, maybe the Feds would have a word with him on their time, but police knocking at the door? Nah. Lastly, how was she close enough to hear what the police were saying to him? Unless she walked up with them... and I highly doubt the LAPD just casually take journalists to bother people for no reason. Calling BS.

Well if you are going to change your mathematical analysis around by an order of magnitude, might as just say that Bitcoin has grow 10000X, or hell, 100000X. What about when Bitcoin was worth close to nothing. Are we approaching infinity? Surely that's not sustainable growth! of course not. Hence why growth isn't always measured linearly. How about something like a period of exponential growth followed by logarithmic growth of some sort? Is that reasonable? Surely the sigmoidal function has been useful in some scenarios. All I'm saying is your mathematical argument is far from flawless even when we ignore our "pedantic" hole picking.

Ahem, actually, if you were to follow the logic all the way through, you would find that there is actually full transparency on the blockchain side of the equation. Things get murky, however, when money is converted into USD.
This is more of a function of Bitcoin not being accepted by all the parties required to participate in said nonprofit than it is an inherent flaw in the blockchain.

Totally agree with the physical medium of storage issue.
Out of curiosity, how do you propose this bit flipping might occur? A system which is improperly hashing? Maybe the designer of the algorithm got a little too comfortable with the ~operator? A wanked out compiler? Surely it can't just be random occurrence. Also, how would other methods of storage avoid similar pitfalls? (assuming similar implementations at the software level?

Here's my opinion (which is a conglomerate of various ideas in this thread). If he does have information, it is important for the community to know it. The mere fact that these people are members of the Bitcoin Foundation does not make them statues of morality. It's laughable to think that we should be attempting to save someone's ass if they were bad actors. Our current financial system is a great testimony to this. Secondly, it's apparent Two Bit Idiot is trying to become the WikiLeaks of Bitcoin, which is more or less a good thing given that his information is true. Widening your audience by temporarily withholding information can outweigh the cons of impulsively releasing information.

I think you make some good points; however, every downside you have mentioned can be mended with time given sufficient incentive. I think lower fees, and general decreased barrier to entry with new technology services (i.e. people are becoming more skilled with computers, etc) could serve as a strong incentive to small business owners. Regardless, cost will decrease with time, ease of use will increase, which could increase incentive to use Bitcoin.

china, coming with the ultimate bluff. everyone things they are in, last minute, boom.
luckily i got into bitcoin for reasons that outweigh short term variance. although it's painful enduring this crash, i consider bitcoin's value to be it's technological contributions to a future society, not in short term speculation.

excellent work sir!

you're right and i completely agree. i think this is because there simply are not enough resellers/distrubuters of goods accepting bitcoin at this point, but as people start recognizing bitcoin as a medium of exchange this can change, but it will not just happen magically. a core user group would help to facilitate this process imo

that's a solid idea i think.

hmm, isn't the idea that if more people begin USING bitcoin then stability increases? imo, this could encourage bitcoin use for causes that are viewed as socially acceptable.
to add, bitcoin's usages are not known to many people, and this could be an interesting way to show people an innovative aspect of bitcoins (namely escrow)

yes i am going!!

just wow, i donate to charity on my own dime with no incentive. in fact, the main incentive i have is to promote bitcoin which i believe to be a socially beneficial invention. 
i have a pretty negligible sum of bitcoin anyway, so there's that too.
