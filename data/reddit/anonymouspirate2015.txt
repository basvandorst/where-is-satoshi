As a miner and Coin Maker I agree, ugh. No one in Crypto who is honest likes a pre-mine. But this pre-mine will be transparent (via the blockchain and press releases) and limited to less than 1% of the total coinbase. And  the public launch which will be broadcast far and wide will begin the very second we finish the two phase pre-mine, at which time I will tweet the mining ports to the world and all can begin to mine. 
As I said, no one likes a pre-mine. But this Alt presents special challenges as a National Currency, certain exceptions have to be made. But MazaCoin gains far more from being a National Coin of such an amazing Nation as the Lakota than it loses from a very modest and transparent pre-mine.

There are many good reasons to permanently boycott PayPal. They are very bad people, a very bad company. There insistence on having the "Anonymous PayPal 14" prosecuted for little more than hitting the refresh button on their site to many times is another. These activists face 15 years in federal prison for simply protesting PayPal online:
Support the PayPal 14, support free speech and free commerce, support BitCoin - and never do business with PayPal again. Close your accounts and make sure to send them an E-Mail telling them exactly why.

It may be a bad omen in your part of the Crypto world perhaps. I like Pirate's myself. You are paying for every movie you download right?  Ahem. You maybe also missed the Anonymous part. That's with a capital A for reference. I am a hacker, as are the vast majjority of developers in the Alt Coin sphere. AnonymousPirate is no stranger than Satoshi or Sunny King in my opinion.

"...will be a terrible introduction to cryptocurrencies for the Native American people."
I think you have a good heart, and don't mean bad here. But let me show you just how insidious racism is, why do you assume that the Native Americans are any less conversant already with Crypto than say an average American?  They CAN read and surf the net you know.

Some of you absolutely kill me. "he's making it to easy too make alts omg" or "omg he's charging to much he's making it to HARD to make alts". Ridiculous. This place is full of people with no life who surf this site looking for people actually doing, you know...stuff. Cool stuff. Just so they can sit there and criticize them because the world is not unfolding just the way THEY think it should. And these perma-critics don't dare to actually do anything constructive themselves, know why?  Because they fear all the others like them will come for them.
BlueMatt's project is awesome, and we have invited him to join the MazaCoin Development Team and help us build the first ever Alt Coin that will be the Official currency of a Sovereign Nation. We didn't ask BlueMatt to join us in making history because of anything he wrote here. We invited him because of what he DID. 
Do something. Create something. Quit sitting here on a glorified forum giving useless and ridiculous criticism and start making the world BETTER for your passing through it.

:-P  Yep. But I am smiling and you are pissed so it looks like I am doing a great job so far. How about you, having fun yet?
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:54:22
I can answer that easy. A government entity is NOT setting up MazaCoin. I am actually a proffessional miner, that's what I do for a living. And I plan on discouraging a 51% attack the same way you would - by throwing as much Gh/s at that chain as I possibly can the very second public mining begins. And I won't be the only one, I am part of a larger consortium - and the entire mining world will know way in advance as well. Not saying someone won't try but basically it's the same strategy as with any Alt, just try and get as much mining power as you can.  We will also be using check-points as a back-up plan.

@_date: 2014-01-05 09:56:18
You'll get your infrastructure in spades trust me. As for the "need" for the MazaCoin I rather think that is the choice for the Lakota to make, don't you?  Because they are very proud and excited to get their own money. Or does their opinion get to be in this debate?

Ok. You are right. Seriously, not being a troll. It's been a hard start to the year, for all of us. So, two things. One I apologize. (perhaps a first in reddit history no?) And two I am going to be a bit more constructive in my approach. I have written an open letter to these Ghash people. They can step up and answer the questions, or me and my people will remain at open war with them. It's their choice. Because while I apologize to the community I do NOT apologize to these people who seem to have gone out of their way to look like and act like complete scoundrels. However, if they stand up and answer the letter's questions, we are willing to make peace. I am sending the letter to them in E-Mail and I will come back and post the Reddit version link here.
Again, I am sorry for the moron comment.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:44:30

Yep, everyone is wrong but you. Everyone is dishonest except you of course. So superior, so arrogant. People like you are precisely what is wrong with this world.
For your information, not that you believe anything but your own greatness - I just retired from a 30 year career as a human rights activist. Where I got paid shit for three decades for the privilege of standing up for those with no voice. And now I mine for a living, believe it or not. I do hope you find at least one way in your life to leave the world just a little better for having passed through it friend.

I have been mining and using Crypto since 2010 and I don't even know what the hell that is. But I have worked on several successful Alt Coins and we are a good and honest team of activists. I think you people need to break out of this insular little community, you all seem far to jaded. The majority of the world are just good decent people trying to do their best. Crypto has turned ugly, with all the greed and fear. Go out doors, do something fresh and positive. Take a random homeless guy out for a good meal, go clean up your local park. Get out of this insular little r/bitcoin world that has jaded you to the awesome goodness that is going on all around you. Crypto was not meant to be like this, it is meant to liberate and stimulate innovation and creativity.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:26:12
So we have a long and detailed explanation from Ghash that clears everything up yet?
Just as I thought. Just like cockroaches, turn on a little light of transparency and they scurry for the shadows again. Anyone doing business with these people deserves the heartache that will surely come from it. My work here is finished.
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:06:57
I do not see where you get this from. All the facts including the total coinbase and the pre-mine (a tiny fraction of a percent mostly for symbolic reasons) is all clear as glass on the website folks. I think before you all go too far perhaps you should actually STUDY what we plan to do, we have been very transparent. I will answer all these comments generally in one post.
@_date: 2014-01-05 10:35:37
You are correct as far as you go, but MazaCoin will be getting it's wealth the same place BTC does - from the global market. It will trade on the Crypto Exchanges from day one. And many global merchants have expressed interest in accepting it from day one. So many that we are trying to pick one now to be a sort of historic "first to accept MazaCoin" kind of pr.

P2Pool is software. Many sites offer P2Pool nodes. P2Pool.org is one of them. I see nothing misleading. As for "making a quick buck" whatever. I am a miner, this is how I pay my rent and eat. I use whatever pool works best. As for the "health of the BitCoin Network" it survived just fine prior to your concern and I am sure it will be around long after. Go after real scammers like "Jeffery Smith" from the Ukraine (yeah, right) who runs the scam site Ghash.io and leave P2Pool.org alone. Many, many miners use them and love them and that is why this fellow made the software. Don't like them?  Don't mine with them, that simple.

If you think Native Tribes have more corruption than your US government you are either naive, or racist. I am leaning towards the latter. No government on earth is more corrupt than the US government. And corruption in the case of Native Tribes is a symptom of the poverty enforced upon them by your pathetic government to try and "control those natives". You are a very bad person.
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:46:07
Thank you so much for your kind words. It is new ground for certain, and thus we are proceeding with great deliberation. We are all aware that it is not just the future of the Lakota at stake, but all the other Tribal and Micro Nations that could benefit. We will do our best to not let the world down, on that you have my word.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:51:20
Thank you for your reply. I think ultimately it IS their choice and I personally agree with their plan.  The correct choice as you put it is whatever choice THEY in THEIR greater wisdom than ours (because it is their nation) decide to do. It is necessary to point out that I am not a Native American, I am a volunteer (white irish cypher punk). So how "that happens" is actually up to them. They are extremely intelligent and well informed, as much or more than you or I. They are in no way ignorant, nor do they need either mine or your advice. They have made their choices and now my job is simply to build their coin for them. If large amounts could be invested this would not be necessary in the first place. As for what is possible, well I think you'll be in for a surprise.  But I thank you for your reply.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:57:53

I honestly, no trolling I honestly have no idea what you are talking about. I tell you what, whatever it is you think you're right about I concede. I have lost the context of the conversation dealing with your personal attacks on my honesty simply because we are on the internet. I frankly don't even care enough to flip back to the thread and try and figure out what this conversation is even about or what you are on about. So whatever, you are right about everything you have ever said in every thread in the entire world. Now fuck off ok?
@_date: 2014-01-05 10:32:18

We would like to recommend you do some good with one of them, please check out the BTC Oyate Project at  a RoboCoin on Lakota land as part of Payu Harris' project would not only highlight the anti-poverty features of BitCoin - but would bring you good PR. Oh, and it would really help people who need it. Follow  for more details. Payu will be appearing on the Max Keiser Show on January 17th and could announce the ATM then to a world audience.

I am far to busy to do your research for you, but on the BitCoin Talk forum there is ample evidence that the cats running this operation are criminals and a danger to not only BitCoin but all Alt coins. They have been caught red handed double spending and abusing their mining power to attack Alt coin chains. They have even publicly admitted such. The evidence is there on the forums and in Google. And that's BEFORE this whole 51% thing blew up. They are a shady dis-honest bunch who now hold a potential Crypto Nuke in their hands. They are scum, and will be stopped. Sometimes pitchforks are a GOOD thing morons.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:40:56
Your comment assumes that MazaCoin is under the control of any government. It is not. MazaCoin is and shall remain under the control of the activists who created it. Payu and I have resisted from the begining any co-opting of the coin into the hands of anyone who would do as you describe. Believe it or not there are many good people out there using their intelligence to attempt to actually make the world a better place and not just chase wealth.
As for competing with the other Alts MazaCoin is a good coin that can hold it's own against them. We will be listed in all the exchanges and payment processors, and many merchants have already told me they want to accept MazaCoin the second they can. It has a good brand, an interesting history. It will rock.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:45:16
That is the plan, and we are making great progress on all aspects of it. The idea in toto is to create a sort of national Crypto Haven to try and help some of these exchanges escape over weening regulation. Eventually we will add hosting of other exchanges that need a haven, and possibly even Crypto Gaming sites as well.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:35:06
Evidence: Ghash ADMITTED in a statement that members of their team did double spend attacks on an innocent site. They neither apologized, nor did they pay back what they stole. They also refused to publicly name the member of their development team they caught doing this. Members of Ghash have often made ominous comments about their ability to overwhelm small Alt chains. They are led by "Jeffery Smith" from Ukraine. Please.

It's called liberty.

The point is that you assume that something so common sense as good accounting is something they won't just automatically do just like it is done in your society. If you don't need to be told this, why do you feel it necessary to advise them?  Maybe they even have BETTER accounting practice than we do who knows!
I also live in Canada, though I am a guest. I am curious do you live on ceded land or unceded?  To my way of thinking the latter is an illegal occupation of another nations land. I am a guest in your country and to be honest I think this government should be ashamed of what it has stolen from the First Nations, and I happily put my freedom on the line for Idle No More whenever I get the chance to help them. What you are facing here in Canada is far graver than Native American Tribes exerting their Sovereign Treaty rights, you are heading for war. I hope the Tar Sands were worth the price you'll pay when that war comes.

I've been a Black Hat for 30 years and I stand proud with my fellow Black Hats. And we do stand ready to take these cats down if they threaten BitCoin. I am not the one who needs to be "legit" here. I do not have control over half the BTC network and the power to destroy whole alt chains in my hand. I do not stand proven to have executed a double spend attack on an innocent site. So my legitimacy is a moot point.

I'm going to respectfully disagree. I don't really see how they are squatting, I don't believe P2Pool is a trademark just an open source project. And I mine for my living and use them extensively. I have ten rigs pointed at various coins on P2Pool.org at this moment and use them almost exclusively. Never had a problem and we love them.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:46:49
I have no  problem with their size. None at all. Read the letter. My issue is with honor and transparency. They are asking the community to trust them, the community is asking to know who the hell it is we are supposed to trust - and why. Doesn't seem too much to ask. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:20:01
Here's the link to the open letter, which I also E-mailed to them. I am sorry but I am not going to hold my breath for a reply from these cats, as I am still convinced they are as shady as it gets. But I am open minded to being wrong, and I think my apology is evidence of that.

My name is AnonymousPirate, I am Payu Harris' Coin Maker for MazaCoin. First, please everyone don't waste your time debating this if you have not at least visited our website and read up on MazaCoin. I am not going to do your research for you after this post, so....
I will use the quotes method to answer as many of these as I can.
"Sorry - they're just not thinking right. They don't need to start up yet another alt-coin - that's ridiculous."
This is one of those "all alts are bad only BitCoin is good" comments. The argument for or against Alt coins in general is being waged elsewhere, I am not going to address this other than to say I think we need as many good Alts as we can possibly get.
"What they - or, really, any of the Native American nations - need to do is take advantage of their unique legal position, and build Bitcoin infrastructure that the US and the banks can't interfere with."
That is and will remain a central core to Mr. Harris' plan. MazaCoin is simply an addition (an exciting one) to this plan. Also mining centers and educational seminars are in there as well.
"I have a bad feeling that adding a layer of obfuscation of a fabricated alt-coin is only for the personal gain of a few individuals."
This is simply insulting to both Payu and the MazaCoin Development Team - who are working insane hours to try and lift a nation out of poverty. Shame on you.
"Exactly; a classic pre-mine doled out to the connected few first."
Again, terribly insulting and dis-honorable comment. But to be clear, there will be two pre-mines. One will be for a National Reserve which is primarily a holding for symbolic reasons although it may prove useful later. The second is for a Tribal Trust which will guarantee in perpetuity that every Lakota person, business or charity can have a grant of MazaCoin. The details are on the website. If you do not believe that a nation that was ruthlessly slaughtered almost to extinction and now lives in crushing poverty does NOT deserve to have this sort of stake in their currency than you are a racist, plain and simple.
"..or in this case the benefit of an elite community."
This "elite community" you speak of, the Lakota - are the victims of American genocide and crushing poverty forcing them to beg for scraps from their enemy. I think they deserve whatever they can get frankly. I will not answer obviously racist posts folks so if your posting racist trash you can fuck off.
"Repeatedly we have read stories of leaders living it up on $100k+ salaries and driving $100k trucks around while the remainder for their people are living in substandard conditions lacking running water etc."
You need to either visit Pine Ridge and educate yourself or stfu frankly.
Ok, the racism is getting to me so that's all I am doing for now. I hate forums, I have to take them in small doses or I become murderous. MazaCoin will roll out right beside not only BitCoin but several other Alt coins as well. It is one small part of a larger plan. Attacking Payu's or my honesty or being racist has no place in this discussion and hence forth I shall ignore such completely. MazaCoin was added to the plan because Alt coins offer the Lakota a unique opportunity to have a National coinage that is more than symbolic, something that is real money. As MazaCoin grows in value and as more Crypto is turned into the hands of the Lakota their dependence on the fiat of the hostile nation that surrounds them can be lessened. They gain more political power, prestige - and eliminate poverty. This is what a GOOD government does for it's people. Remember that the Lakota have poverty because they are surrounded by a hostile nation that has them under economic siege by their total dependence upon their fiat money. ANYTHING, even symbolic that helps to break that is good for the Lakota.
One of the things that Payu and I have resisted is allowing the government of the Lakota to completely co-opt the coin. We get it that every government even the Lakota are susceptible to abuse. We have made it clear to them that we will not allow MazaCoin to be politicized, seized - or controlled by any entity.
MazaCoin on the global market will thrive. I have already talked with the owners of the major exchanges and payment processors and they are excited to add MazaCoin when it is publicly launched. MazaCoin will trade on at least one exchange within minutes of being launched, and it will do well. It's a two way street, yes the Lakota benefit from MazaCoin but MazaCoin likewise benefits from being the only Alt out there that has a nation backing it. And a wonderful, gorgeous and proud nation at that.
But I warn you all one last time. If you are racist take it somewhere else. Trust me, you do NOT want to go there with me. And if you have some honesty issues you better have some evidence to pony up before attacking peoples character you don't even know yet.
