TIL I learned Satoshi Nakamato is also an urban planner

It was a terrible read. He is not a very good writer. Arthur, if that is you, please make a youtube video. That's the ultimate proof. The driver's license thing, that can be easily forged.

He should lie low for a bit, it was a close one with his cover almost blown. His best bet right now would be to hope the allegations just go away over time especially considering his post last night (quite a gambit there)

what did you have? feeling like cracking open a beer myself after a hard day of work. 
maybe you can write a book about it later.

Arent you the dude that got arrested for money laundering?&gt;

i'd still fuck her

Uhh... this honestly seems like a troll. There are all sorts of irrelevant details in it. And humble and handsome? Huh? Whats the point of in throwing that in? So either this is some sort of crazy trolling or Arthur Nakamato has got some terrible public speaking [writing?] skills... but it's forgivable if it's really him.

no. guy has been in fucking america for over 30 years, how the hell can he not speak/write english properly? i got nigerian neighbor that has been here for 5 years and he writes 3x better than this guy. not to mention that it isn't grammar or anything that makes his writing terrible. it is the style/train of thought that is really confusing about it that makes you think this guy is trying to troll people for laughs,
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:56:46
3. Arthur is random ass guy trolling everyone for laughs.
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:18:44
OK? People are still curious.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:57:14
This is a strawman argument. I think people, me personally included, are interested in SN for historical reasons. We'd just like to know. Besides who doesn't like a good mystery?
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:51:54
I upvoted that and I'm not a misogynist. Just a guy that would like to see her naked. I'd do her.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:16:49
no i'm talkign about yesterday with the free lunch and stuff LOL
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:43:34
I prefer the first one. lol
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:01:52
Well the onus is definitely on those of us who think it's him. I personally think it's him but I don't have proof. It's really strange why he went through all that trouble when he could've just publically said it wasn't him right then and there, but decided to throw in the econ reference not to mention he was unemployed and "at home" the same time BTC was being developped. We may never know... though being a curious guy I hope we eventually find out. \*shrugs\*
IF we ever get proof it is him though, I have to say, I am super impressed and the entire thing was brilliant not to mention comical. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:53:44
Also if it is him and they just want to be left alone why the hell did he come back and keep posting more personal info after personal info? Smells like trolling.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:44:05
This is actually a good idea. How much does it even cost? No more than like 20 bucks at most I'm guessing. So you lose like 20 bucks at most, but can stand to gain a shitload if it actually does turn out to be SN or whatever novelty value it could have later on even if it's not. 
bury it for me guys. I don't want this selling out before I get my hands on one! lol

Probably stressed out over all the death threats and stuff. look at those bags under her eyes, probably didn't even sleep last night. I was watching it thinking she was going to burst into tears at any moment.
