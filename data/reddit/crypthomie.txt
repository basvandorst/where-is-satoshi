Stock to flow. I let you research.

If you want to be the kind of person who buys high and sell low then yes do it.
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:29:54
I upvote but I don't know what it is.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:31:15
No it would be the French independence 14th of July. We beheaded our King and Queen.

I did trade BTC in an airplane with Wi-Fi. 12000 feet.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:14:33
Buy real estates and keep some btc.

As a 1999 hodler, my mind is mindblown.
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:37:20
You must be damn rich. Well done
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:36:52
I would be panic charging my phone if I was you.
@_date: 2019-07-06 07:38:37
No matter what you write, I'm gonna downvote you all the way.

@_date: 2019-08-06 05:14:35
Thanks a lot I will check them out!
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:36:26
It's an experimentation. If it's successful, it will be heard everywhere I'm telling you.
"A random guy got "****"$ in bitcoin from strangers on reddit without any third party controlling the donations!"
That would make a good news on TV or everywhere on internet.

I am giving classes to my co-workers about crypto and blockchain. So far more than 25 of them are aware of what's going on and we are more than 6000 in my company.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:33:45
Yes I did
@_date: 2019-08-01 13:25:26
And in 5 years he will say that he made a mistake not buying at 10k too.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:56:26
Alright, do you have a BAT address ? I can send you 1$ worth of those. You'll be eventually not sending it back but you'll see I'm honest.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:47:10
That's absolutely not necessary. Do you insult people of scumbag in the street when they ask for money? I guess no. You're just doing your keyboard warrior behind your screen, but you would never say that in real life, so act the same here.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:02:38
There's no criminal and no victim here. You wanna part of it or not. Check my reddit profile, not like I made it 2 days ago and I have no karma.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:41:21
You call me an asshole for what reason please ? Am I forcing you to send me anything ? Am I selling a scam ? An asshole is someone stealing something from you, killing someone, torturing animals, but never someone asking for money. Because I give you the choice. If I was pointing a gun and telling you you send me all your crypto I would be an asshole.
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:53:09
I started 8 days ago btw.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:11:48
You're making nothing as I was willing to do it.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:42:56
I'm not asking you to believe me. If I was wealthy I wouldn't ask. And I'm just saying 1$. Just to prove that even the smallest amount can make the difference for 1 person without harming thousands.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:44:59
I made a course where I make them understand what bitcoin is in layman's terms and also about blockchain as both can't survive without each other. 
Most people really have no idea of what's going on regarding those "new" technologies.
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:09:04
Yes I'm talking about the way financial system works and also explain what inflation is. They got the picture.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:48:20
I never said that I will send back anything. I'm being totally honest.
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:59:03
With 129100 stats you'll be able to by a decent car in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:38:40
Am I being rude or insulting ? It's not like I am making a scam. What I'm saying is very honest and straight forward. I'm not forcing anyone. I would be the first surprised to receive anything but there's no need to be insulting.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:14:41
This is where blockchain will play a major role. Once people will be able to have a private blockchain, they will store private datas only accessible by themselves including their seed phrase.

Flight attendant ?
@_date: 2019-12-27 12:42:55
Were you in a cave to post this so late ?
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:23:46
Datadash is part of it so not good.
@_date: 2019-12-22 12:01:43
Oh man I think you didn't understand anything to life. What matters is to be happy and to do what you like. You don't even know my life and you judge.
What if I tell you that this year I went in more than 40 different countries which I do for the past 6 years and I manage to have a max level character with the best gear you can get atm. Also have a wife, and other hobbies. So keep your advice for you, I'm doing pretty well even tho I'm geek.
Now in vacation for 2 weeks in Philippines after coming back from China, Korea and Japan. Don't judge people playing video games.

It was actually my last AV before getting exalted !
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:36:58
It's true and it's my flat.

How can you not use dark theme
@_date: 2019-12-22 11:54:45
Thanks for the silver !
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:32:37
Why everyone think that we all live in USA ? I don’t have IRS where I live neither taxes.
@_date: 2019-12-27 12:39:56
What is that creepy shit ?
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:43:31
I love it !
