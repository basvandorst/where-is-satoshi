Thanks for the tip.  Yea... I agree with your above point.  I recognized the same problem with the limitations of profit.  That said, it's still a step forward in the sense that you can make profit if you have enough liquid capital.  You could buy a ton of bitcoin and start selling calls.  It's no where near as good (a lot more risk etc), but it's all I could think of that could be implemented without bashing at financial regulations.
That said, anyone have ideas besides Venmo?  Chargebacks would be a bitch for this

Thanks for the suggestion!  The problem with a max bet is that people can just do something stupid like bet from multiple accounts. The way I tried to get around this is with the % fee taken from the game.  That is, if the pot is size 500 and you bet 1 billion, the 2% taken from 1 billion 500 makes it not worth it to bet as high as possible.

Thanks for playing the first game of BitMajority guys!
Considering we're a new website and no one was going to slam down a big play immediately, it's not surprising that team B won.  Payments will be coming out shortly.
In the mean time, feedback?

Thanks for the ideas!
Weighting bids -  yea we're really trying to figure out a good f(t) here.  We just came up with something simple but if people play and want a different function we can always change it.
Rolling games - yup we considered this and originally want 4 games a day.  However, since we just started and don't want too many games, we thought of start 1 game a day until more people started playing.  On a side note, does 4 games a day sound good (6 hour skips)
Last Call - thats something we didn't consider.... It sounds like a good idea but i don't know if that'll just end up being terrible.  Say you're on the losing team, wouldn't you just keep betting minimum amounts until you're over?  I'd feel like the game would never end end we'd have this HUGE build up of BTC haha.
Team League - Can you explain this a little bit more?  This sounds interesting but I don't quite understand - do the players have a limited money supply for the team owner?

There's a How To Play but honestly, I'm a terrible writer so can you let me know which part is confusing so I can try rewriting it?

So I hear venmo allows charge backs I think this mean this fails

To this end,
I just pushed some code so you can see your current Expected Return.  Let me know if this makes it more clear!

Hmm, I forgot to respond to the original multiple team idea..  I think it's quite nice and adds more flexibility and chance for big payouts.  That said, I'm not sure if it'll just degenerate into a two team game where the additional spots are abused by big players to make big winnings (think dump a ton of money on an empty side to win everything).
last call - Yea.. the sniping aspect is quite annoying though we were hoping that the % cut and score system would remove incentive for those types of plays.  I do like the idea of extending X times, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this too.  Let's say for instance it ends at time t.  WLOG if team 1 was winning, team 2 would definitely use the overtime, meaning they could continue bidding until t + 5.  Considering that team 2 would bid over, which gives team 1 the opportunity to win it back.  TLDR: I agree there needs to be more mechanisms to remove incentive for sniping than currently exists but am unsure if this is the correct way.
The issue of getting people to be more attached to the game is a really important point.  That is definitely something I would like to examine more.

Hey guys,
We noticed that our current payement model is rather confusing in terms of intuitive return.  Those of you who've already made their investments, I hope you guys don't mind if we change the payout so that if you're on the winning team, you ALWAYS win something (pre-fee of course).  Otherwise, it seems some of you may be on the winning team but still lose some BTC.
Instead what we'll do is, your payout if you win is
Payout = Initial investment + (your score/team score) * (BTC invested by losing team)
As you can see, you will always get as much as you invested as long as you were on the winning team.  Let me know if you have problems with this - Thanks!

Good point!  We tried to make this as fair as possible so I'll try to explain some balancing issues.
First,  playing at the last second is probably a good strategy to ensure victory, but if everyone plays at the last second, how do you know how much to put in?
You might say, oh if you have 1337 bitcoins, just put it all in because no one else will have enough BTC to beat you.  However, there are two issues - you might not get a return on your investment if you bet too late (the scores are too high already) and the winnings don't justify the investment! 
Ex: If the multiplier at the beginning was 5 (its actually 2 but im just trying to show an example) and lets say at the beginning two people bet 1.  So score is 5 and 5 and the pot is 2.  At the end of the game, lets say you try to snipe by putting in 5 BTC with a multiplier of 1.  Your team wins but you only receive 5/10 of the jackpot due to your score being 5 out of the teams score of 10.  That means you win 1/2 of 7 which is only 3.5 in comparison to your initial 3.5 investment.
Moreover, we take a small percentage of the winnings (roughly 1% at the moment) to prevent this additionally - if the number of BTC in the pot is only 500 and you bet 1 million, 1% of 1million won't cover the costs of winning 500.
Let  me know if you think of anything else!

Hi guys,
I developed this game with my friend over here.  We would really appreciate any helpful advice!  We thought up of this game over the weekend and built it for fun.

Winners have been paid, please check the website for transactions.  Let me know if something went wrong!

So to bypass this issue, one potential (annoying) solution is to price it in USD but value it in bitcoins.
If i agree to pay you Z USD and we both agree to use the average of bitstamp and mtgox as a valuation, I pay you Z USD in bitcoins based on what I could purchase with current market depth using limit orders
I'm just afraid that they'll try to manipulate the market... the best I could do is say its a random time between times X and Y and you have 1hr to purchase after time Y
