ok, well seeing as you realize it's a bet and not a sure thing then all I can say is good luck!
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:12:24
Yeah well we should've waited longer. Bitcoin will be less than 1k before this thing is done.

Well to use your analogy, a virus grows as long as there are resources for it to feed. In the case of a stock or an asset like bitcoin, it will grow as long as there is a demand for it. Demand (or the size of the market) is always limited and if the valuation increases beyond the demand it will eventually collapse. It will not continue to grow forever unless the demand continues to grow forever. 
The question is, what is the demand for bitcoin? Nobody knows but there sure is a lot of speculation about that.

It's not predictable at all. With knowledge of the underlying asset and the general public sentiment it's possible to make a qualified guess of where it's heading but trying to figure out which way it will go from studying a graph is no better than reading tea leafs.

I'm basing that on what bitcoin actually is worth to people and what real problems it solves. Right now it's close to nothing. I'm not saying bitcoin or something similar will not be big some day but not with the current technology. The only thing keeping the price up is the expectation for a day in the future when crypto rules. What I'm saying (along with leading experts) is that that day is far away yet. The hype is way too early.

But what you are doing is basically taking 20k USD and betting it all on that bitcoin will go up. What if bitcoin goes down and doesn't recover? Can you take that loss? Can you afford to gamble that much money? If the answer is yes and you wanna make the gamble go ahead but if not I would say this is very foolish. Bitcoin lost 5.5 % just a couple of hours ago, that's how volatile the thing is. And the writings are all over the wall that bitcoin is overvalued still.

Sorry but you guys are idiots. Why do you still believe in this? It's over yet you are still pissing away money at it
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:52:02
Nah man. Last cycles were still only techies. It went mainstream this time. Everyone and their granma bought. No new adapters to push it up. It's over and that's not emotions, just sound reasoning.

I'm not a troll I'm just saying it's not very wise to try to catch knives in this. You might think you are getting in cheap but nobody knows the intrinsic value. Past prices are irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:43:48


A lot of smart people, who did their research lost a lot of money because they didn't realize prices where inflated by hype. I don't know where the bottom is but I'm not jumping on until there is something that gains traction and shows potential to work in the real-world.
I might miss out but at the same time, I'm not wasting money on a bunch of coins that will inevitably go to zero.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:31:39
And then you can watch that become worthless too just like your investment choices.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:47:03
It's quite amazing that people are still trying to catch knives thinking they are getting in cheap when actually nobody knows if it is cheap or not. Past history is irrelevant. Nobody knows the intrinsic value since it's all speculation at this point.

I was referring to the past price history of btc. 
But buying an extremely volitile currency that has fallen 70% in a year seems like a poor way to safeguard from possible failng fiats. I'd rather buy gold then or invest in basically any other commodity
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:21:53
Easier said then done mate. How do you know the bull run will continue and that it's just a dip? Most people don't. They may think that they do but they don't.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:26:04
So now you're down 3000$ and your teeth are still crocked. I'm sure there is a lesson there somewhere... hmm... whatever ..buy the dip!
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:36:47
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:14:42
Everyone keeps saying that but nobody has a source.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:46:40
I can relate in the sense that I was a fool who took the advice of YouTubers and it taught me a valuable lesson. I'm glad that there are people enthusiastic about crypto but I strongly believe that trading and investing should be done without any emotions or dogmatic believes. Too many people here get burned for investing with their heart and holding on to dogmatic believes. 
I look at crypto and I see that it's 2% meaningful development of a technology that might be interesting in the future but not in its current form. The other 98% is hype. Thats why I wont touch any crypto investing with a ten foot stick untill it all settles down.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:48:05
You are right. It is purely speculation. Makes it even riskier to try to buy dips.
