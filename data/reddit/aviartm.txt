Yes. I have verified ID, credit card, and bank account. Still, I’m restricted. :/

Ok? The United States.

Huh.

Reason being? Then where should I go?

Every currency in the world has an subjective price. We would value Bitcoin just how we value real currencies today. Through trust and faith.

Boy, have the times have changed since 2011.

I would say so but it’s up to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs). I wondered the same question. 
The ISPs could slow down and charge you more for the use of Coinbase, Bittrex, BitStamp, etc. 
Which could deter newcomers and slow down growth and performance.
We will have to see if it occurs.

Just YouTube “Cryptocurrencies explained simply”. The Wikipedia page of Bitcoin has a 3 minute long video explaining the concept of Bitcoin.

I recommend using MinerGate. You are able to mine up to 10 different Cryptocurrencies with wallets and everything. And you get to decide how many cores you want to use, whether you want to use your computer at the same time or not. But doing it often can result in your CPU breaking down. I would do it on your $300 PC full-time and have a fan by it and occasionally do it on your AlienWare for about 20-40 mine at a time.

The main point was to decrease volatility.

Bitcoin Cash is still Bitcoin essentially, all they did was make transaction times faster and larger blocks to 8MB instead of 1MB on Bitcoin.

Yes, but they believe Net Neutrality will bring an inevitable apocalyptic future (Whether you support or not, it’s not as bad as it really is tbh).
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:09:07
Oof.

I get your point but I would say no unless drastic measures were taken by the ISPs. 
Ajit Pai did discuss about Bitcoin mining and how repealing Title II will not discourage nor harm the operations of it.

It was programmed differently than before. The Satoshi Nakamoto Wikipedia pages goes a bit more in-depth. 
“The inventor left a text message in the first mined block which reads 'The Times 3 January 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks'. The text refers to a headline in The Times published on 3 January 2009. It is a strong indication that the first block was mined no earlier than this date. The genesis block has a timestamp of 18:15:05 GMT on 3 January 2009. This block is unlike all other blocks in that it doesn't have a previous block to reference. This required the use of custom code to mine it. Timestamps for subsequent blocks indicate that Nakamoto did not try to mine all the early blocks solely for himself.”

I bet only about 30-40 kids at my HS have discussed about Bitcoin on a small manned. And I can only bet about 8 have definitely talked about it on a thorough sense. I’m absolutely appalled by the obliviousness of my peers.

That’s up to the people.
