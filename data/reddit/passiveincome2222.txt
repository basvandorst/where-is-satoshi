This is big money coming in, so this is not the same as end of 2017. End of 2017 bull was caused by average joe, this is caused by small and medium small institutional money. Of course it will drop back and there will be a bearrun again in the future, but nobody can destroy Satoshi's mathematic formula and his Whitepaper.

No other explanation than big money coming in and holding.

There was 88 percent dip. How low can you go? Market sentiment changed + indeed possible small and medium small institutional money came in. But you just can't explain btc. It's alot of guessing.

When is Facebook launching Libra?

Yeah if it was so easy we'll all be doing it. The only winning strategy is holding.

Pullback probably won't be as fast as january 2018. Big difference is small to medium small institutional money is causing this bull. These guys won't pull their money back as fast as average joe in january 2018. It's going to break alle records this year.

Binance coin?

Simply by saying it's true. It doesn't exclude the underlying fundementals, namely the fact that it's a trustless method of transferring money based on math. This is the real intrinsic value of btc.

Once we break through 11.7k next resistance is at 16k (!). Take note.

The previous price gains

It bounces up so fast. Precisely the inverse of the bearmarket of 2018, when every gain bounces back downwards.

Is this caused by the whale who wanted to buy 70 percent of btc?
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:32:54
97 percent get fucked trading. Especially men are very bad at trading.

Average Joes are trying to cash out, but every time there's more and more money coming in. This is a never ending bull ;)

Shocking: 75 percent of trading of crypto is done by bots. Increased volume caused by bots. This is a complete fiasco.
