Most of gold's price is just monetary premium, because it has the highest stock-to-flow ratio relative to anything else (before bitcoin showed up). Gold is scarce, while bitcoin is strictly scarce in that the price going up cannot incentivize/drive the mining of more bitcoins like what happens with gold or other goods.
Stock to Flow Ratio is the amount of a commodity held in inventories divided by the amount produced annually. 
JW-Weatherman lists a lot of advantages bitcoin has over gold in this video, in talking about how and why the gold standard was subverted in the first place. I don't want to type more right now or else I'd summarize his points for you.

Is Walter Block a libertarian? Pretty sure whoever you are he has 100x the libertarian bonafides that you do, and he put forward a good case for voting for Trump as a lesser evil. The libertarians who believe that there is something morally wrong and unlibertarian about voting defensively are retarded and get crushed in every debate they participate in. It was very easy to calculate that the Trump admin would be less aggressive and pillaging towards me and people I care about, relative to Hillary Clinton. The Democrat party is pretty insane these days if you haven't noticed.

It's probably just media brainwashing and Trump derange syndrome that makes you think Trump is insane and worthy of invoking mentions of Stalin and Hitler. He's wrong on issues, not a libertarian, but not someone who stands out as being particularly bad among a lineup of other Presidents at all. A little over a decade ago he would have been called a moderate or centrist. 
For instance he hasn't really escalated any war or interventionistic campaigns in the middle east, whereas Hillary was a frothing out the mouth neocon warmonger who bragged about overthrowing Gaddafi even though it threw Libya into hellish chaos. In comparison to Bush and Obama and what Hillary would have been like, Trump merely beats his chest and makes tough militaristic sounds for the purposes of diplomatic leverage. He bombed ISIS a lot, but so what about them. He speaks with countries like Russia and North Korea rather than escalating tensions with them. 
Trump is most bashed regarding the immigration issue even though a majority of Americans agree that illegal immigration should be stopped, and I think the libertarians who make the argument that the Democrat's policy of unlimited mass migration while offering them endless welfare, is by far more in violation of the non-aggression principle than enforcing border law. Mass migration to achieve more favorable electoral results (the Democrat's motive in allowing it), diminishes the power of tax paying citizens even more than it has already been diminished and increases the likelyhood of more aggression against them as disempowered tax livestock. Prominent libertarian pundits such as Dave Smith argue this, as well as libertarian intellectuals such as Hans Herman Hoppe and Stefan Molyneux. Unlimited mass migration + expansions of the welfare state, is out and out an attack on citizens that quite obviously increases the likelyhood of statist expansions. These are the most important reasons I voted for him as being by far the less evil, enough to be worth it, relative to Hillary Clinton. 
These are but two issues (war and immigration), could go on and on and get into wonderful things like Democratic party trying to normalize the racist idea of "reparations", advocating for economic lunacy and soft-communism such as UBI, and openly trashing the 1st amendment while wanting to require social media companies to act even more Orwellian than they already do. 
In comparison the complaints about Trump being a big meanie head and not likable as a person are pretty small, he's a milquetoast statist who appeals to voters on quite reasonable grounds regarding immigration, whereas I see the Democrats championing a path that would seem to extinguish even the possibility of ever transitioning to a more free society in the distant future. In 2016 it was easy to calculate that it was worth voting for him defensively against the alternative, but yes it's possible he won't pass that calculation for 2020 and I hated his bitcoin tweet.

Relax guise it's not technically censorship it's just corporate tech totalitarianism. So long as it is corporations acting as big brother and not the government then it's perfectly fine!!! No matter that companies like google and Facebook are in bed with other governments like China and Germany to strictly control the internet, that isn't happening here yet so why worry? Why would bitcoiners be worried about financial deplatforming of thought criminals? So long as they only go after illiberal "hate speech"... I mean it isn't like the establishment won't just continually broaden what is considered as hate speech to consolidate their power.
Yes small business Christian bakers have to be forced to make cakes with sexually explicit designs, but tech monopolies that have vast power over our society should be able to deplatform anyone who challenges their globalist cultural Marxist ideology. I for one as a liberal am baffled why a community that advocates for decentralization would be alarmed by big tech companies tipping the scales of public discourse in favor of political centralization. I'm sure Jones was deplatformed just for his sandy hook and  chemicals in the water type stuff and not because he was an influential opponent to political globalism.

It doesn't bother me much that there are some liberals afflicted with enough cognitive dissonance such that they actually support bitcoin, let them accidentally derail their own politics. If Bitcoin displaces fiat, no socialism.
How fucking stupid they are though if like many liberals today they support online censorship of free speech, but also support uncensorable transfer of value. Do you lot think crackdown on free speech will be healthy for bitcoin's social ecosystem? First they came for Alex Jones, next it will be be commentators like Stefan Molyneux, next crypto-anarchists like Nick Szabo. Why not? All anti-establishment voices are considered thought criminals who engage in "hate speech" by the left these days. Are you right of a milquetoast classical liberal with a few socially liberal positions? You're still a fucking nazi going by the hysterics of the left these days. Are you a black Trump supporter? White supremacist. Wikileaks supporter? Russian bot. Since the bitcoin devs aren't tools, I'm sure virtually all of them are thought criminals as well. Deplatform them and force them to converse in the dark web, along with all the libertarian rabble who go on about disrupting the status quo with their terrorist money that members of the alt-right use.

If you want an endless amount of immigrants coming into the country and going on welfare, it would be more moral of you to pay their bills and child support yourself rather than forcing others to through politics. And yes, illegal immigrants are disproportionately represented in crime statistics and in the tax-consuming parasitic class. And no, there is nothing wrong with middle class tax paying Americans not wanting to be demographically displaced and burdened by the Democrat's strategy of simply importing massive amounts of people from poorer 3rd world countries (who will more likely vote Democrat to insure the flow of handouts) rather than representing existing tax-contributing Americans. 
You might be insulated from the Washington DC status quo idiocy, you might be insulated from globalism, but show a little empathy and understand that not all Americans are and that Trump won because he spoke to issues many are impacted by and right to be concerned about. You're just being intellectually lazy and dishonest by insinuating its a matter of racism and flying off half-cocked on twitter. There isn't anything silly about a country having borders, in fact it used to be perfectly normal for both sides of the aisle to talk about border security and limiting immigration before the left became so unhinged from reality. That you think the cesspool of corruption and idiocy that was the Democrat and neocon-Republican status quo before Trump represented a smarter way that was actually serving the interest of Americans, is just evidence that you yourself are just a fool rambling on the internet. Reddit-brained liberals in their echochambers are not always right. Not all cultures are equal, socialism and globalism are cancers upon the well being of the vast majority of Americans, and American citizens do have the right to self-interest in their own country and government over non-citizen illegals despite how propagandized and bluepilled you may be in believing otherwise.

Peter Schiff as an Austrian economist should know that value is subjective. Its not up to him to decide what is valuable, it is up to the millions of individuals that comprise the market. There is no "true rationality" to determine what has "muh intrinsic value". Gold is just a shiny metal, that if fetches the high price that it does is just as "silly" as bitcoin fetching the price it does. And yes you are right bitcoin's usefulness was more than enough reason for individuals to start ascribing value to it, its ever growing network effect is yet more reason, even its "coolness" is additional reason, on and on.  
People are right to point out that he just talks shit about bitcoin because its in his interests as a businessman to do so.

The problem is leftists have become so unhinged its quite common they accuse anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders of being a Nazi. It's too much of a slippery slope, better to just respect free speech and freedom of assembly. There were plenty of people at the protest in Charlottesville who were not supremacists, the majority of the alt-right don't even believe in white supremacy they believe in racial differences and that since its okay for every other race to do identity politics and have in-group preferences then it should be okay for whites as well. Disagree with them all you want, but people's rights don't end where other's feelings begin. I'm sure you have views that many others would find emotionally triggering, and hold some unpopular views about *something*.

Everyone always has that concern the first time they buy bitcoin to just hodl them. Truth is you have no way of knowing if its going to moon or crash right after you buy in. I remember having this same anxiety when I bought my first bitcoins back at 289. But as it turned out, I've obviously been having a blast hodling. All you can do is ask if you are bullish on bitcoin long term, if you think that bitcoin's price will be higher a year or two from now and if you think you can endure to see a possible -$20 or -$40 correction after you buy.

Money has more purposes than just serving as a medium of exchange. The volatility slows down and usage for everyday exchange goes up, as the store of value use case nears its maximum potential market saturation. Read Saifedean Ammous' book The Bitcoin Standard so you are not continually surprised by Bitcoin's continued success, continued volatility, and continued appropriate labeling as a form of money. Or at least refer to Murad Mahmudov's Lindy Effect chart. 
Any cryptocurrency or pretend cryptocurrency that strives to become a medium of exchange before first proving itself to the global masses as a store of value, is doomed in its mission to overthrow the king BTC. It's just a common misconception that bitcoin's volatility is dooming its mission to become full global money, the upwards volatility is just a stage in proving itself and becoming accepted as a store of value for more and more people. Store of value use case acceptance / mass market adoption is necessary, otherwise the network can never move past being a mere payment system that doesn't challenge fiat's supremacy. 
People's notion of money is fairly warped because we're so used to inflationary fiat currencies being absolute garbage stores of value to the point of being pointless to save so of course are thought as ONLY mediums of exchange, and we've never seen a new type of money rise from nothing to global acceptance before so don't know what that process looks like.

I still think it's an arbitrary claim that money has to be physical commodity based. He's still trying to create a specific category that excludes bitcoin, a category which does not exist. The claim that money must arise from a commodity origin similar to that of something like gold, is based on a flimsy self-serving understanding of Mises' Regression theorem. 
One can read this article and see that Schiff's particular notion of intrinsic value that excludes bitcoin, goes against what actual Austrian economists say about how a money can arise. Libertarian cypherpunks  finding bitcoin neat enough to collect in the sub $1 price range way back in the day, is itself enough to comply with Mises' Regression Theorem. 
In other words his claim that gold's commodity use cases make it a valid money candidate, while young bitcoin's early status as merely an ideologically motivated cool collectible makes it dubious or less valid, is an entirely subjective claim. But the "intrinsic value" term impresses upon people something more than arbitrary/subjective preference. So when he speaks like this in debates and stuff, I think he should be clear that he speaks only from his own Peter Schiff school of economic thought. As opposed to when he's discussing other economic matters where he is clearly drawing on the Austrian school.
Commodities don't have a special property called intrinsic value, their valuation is subjective. As an individual my subjective preference is that I have no desire to buy gold anything, whatever minuscule amounts of gold exist in the electronics I've bought hardly accounts for its present high price. The only time I've ever intentionally bought gold specifically, is when I speculated by buying american eagles. Which I sold a long time ago to buy bitcoin.

Wouldn't intel sell mining gear to anyone, rather than keep the tech to themselves or selling it to only one or two large miners, thus increasing decentralization? In the case of Bitmain patenting their hardware, that obviously resulted in more centralization. But Intel isn't Bitmain, it isn't in their interests to keep their hardware patents to themselves? I mean they enforce the patent but sell to others, so its an open entry barrier to gain the efficiency advantages their innovations provide.

Was there any barrier to entry preventing people from getting into Bitcoin earlier? Practically speaking (in terms of knowledge, tech skills, and willingness to assume risk) yes there was, literally speaking (as in a legal or status barrier) no. With fiat the masses don't have access to newly created money before it's purchasing power is erroded. If you're not a bank, the government, or part of the politically connected class that lives off of government spending, you don't have the same access to the monetary spigot. Bitcoin is more fair than fiat in that regard. Depending on whether you're an equality of outcome guy, you might not think Bitcoin is fair enough, but it's much fairer than fiat.

"paid bitches of putin"... It is amazing what kind of retarded tinfoil narratives people will fall for if enough sleazy propagandists keep repeating it. No evidence for that at all.

Iraq had WMDs, and we have always been at war with EastAsia. 
Muh Russia wasn't just a defensive narrative spun out of convenience by the DNC to distract people from the corruption revealed in their leaked emails, and Obama didn't score debate points against Mitt Romney for rebuking him that "the cold war is over Mitt".

Yeah they have so much evidence they just want to sit on their asses with it instead of prosecuting people connected with Trump so that the actual basis for starting the special counsel in the first place can be justified. It isn't just a partisan tool that is slowly dying and becoming less credible to anyone with half a brain, that was started by unelected unaccountable bureaucrats who have already been shown to be liars and snakes (Comey and Strzok) who were themselves using corrupt means to influence the election. Such as using easily discreditable opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign to justify a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.
They aren't just keeping the dying show alive by trotting out anything they can even if it's irrelevant to the collusion tinfoil theory, to prevent the Dems mid term "blue wave" from becoming even more flaccid than it already has once they end the charade. The FBI and DOJ were so concerned about Russian interference during the election and immediately after, that virtually none of their internal communications that have been released show them discussing it at all, far from it there was only partisan banter about how they must stop Trump by conspiring themselves. 
You're totally not just a low info fake news consuming retard. Stay delusional, I like seeing libs perpetually surprised and hammered by reality.

How much will BTC go up when the altcoin market really starts to crash? This only looks like the start of it.

I'm not buying myself but short term its probably already over and the rally will continue. A week from now who knows. You have to ask if you'll be able to stomach missing out on 3000k+, or if you buy and it happens to go down whether you will still be comfortable in believing that it will just go back up again anyways.

Sold all mine for pizzas. Pizzas are way more useful if you ask me. What is bitcoin anyways? Might as well be WoW gold, both are farmed by the Chinese.

This is proof that bitcoin is a Russian plot!
