Great question! No matter the payment method, when you place a purchase, you receive the same amount of digital currency regardless of the price change.
For example, if you purchased 1 BTC at $1000/BTC today and your purchase did not complete until Wednesday, at which time the price of BTC is $1100, you would still receive 1 BTC.

Our payment processor initiates a pre-authorization charge prior to actually charging a customer's card to ensure the card is active. This is similar to what you may see when making a purchase from a gas station or bar. 
It's very likely that this is the case with your pending charges. They are still processing and they will not complete. You should see them removed from your card within 10 business days.

It looks like the network is experiencing an unusually heavy load from excessive transactions. You will likely see many other wallets/services having delayed transactions and requiring additional confirmations before a balance is considered valid. 
Transactions with high enough processing fee should eventually be confirmed as miners work through the backlog of unconfirmed transactions on the network.

All outgoing transactions are reported as sell orders and show the gain or loss of those bitcoin.
EDIT: It is up to each user to calculate and report taxes associated with their bitcoin trades. Coinbase provides a report as a tool to assist users in this process. Using Coinbase's tax report *does not* determine your tax liability or lock you into filing your taxes based on the report.
By default, transactions into or out of your Coinbase wallet are reported as buys or sells at the current market price because we do not have visibility outside our platform.  Users are free to apply any appropriate accounting method in calculating their taxes. If you have other information about a particular transaction - for example a bitcoin send from your Coinbase account to another wallet you control - then you may choose to take that into account in filing your taxes.

Coinbase uses a payment processor located in the UK for global card processing. As a result, the transaction may appear to originate from the UK but all processing fees remain the same as quoted on your confirmation screen and email.
If your card is declining or failing charges, this suggests that your card issuer has blocked the charges on their end. For any issues with blocked purchases, please call your card issuer (the customer service number is on the back of your card) and request they permit and process purchases from 'Coinbase.'

Great questions!
1. This weekly limit is a rolling 7-day period. i.e. if you deplete your limit on Monday, you will be unable to purchase again until the following Monday.
2. Unfortunately the limit applies to all instant payment methods. Adding multiple cards will not increase your limits or allow you to buy more.
3. This is correct. You can buy instantly with funds in your USD Wallet, but your weekly buy limit (not instant buy limit) will apply.

I'm very sorry for the delay in receiving your bitcoin.
Due to extremely high purchase and deposit volume, we have been experiencing a delay of several days with ACH deposits and buy orders. As a result, our estimated clearing date for your recent buy order or deposit was not accurate.
Bank transfers normally take 3-5 business days to complete. We try and make that expected delivery estimate as accurate as possible, and are always looking to improve it. Rest assured that your transfer is safe and the funds should arrive within the next couple business days. 
We process bank payments using ACH transfers. You can find more information via our support page: 
Also note that Saturday and Sunday are not bank business days, so keep in mind that buy and sell orders, along with ACH bank deposits and withdrawals, do not process on the weekend and will also delay an order.
We know that getting your funds quickly is extremely important to you, and we deeply apologize for this delay. 
Thanks for bearing with us as we grow with the digital currency community.
