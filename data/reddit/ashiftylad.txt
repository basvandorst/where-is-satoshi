uncensorable sure, but entirely transparent which doesnt protect the wallet user.

3 basic ways to start crypto
1)Do basic research into coins that interest you, read white paper, and find what kind of projects youd like to invest in.  (most dont do this)
2) Invest in the top performing coins for price to market cap, or just price overall (what alot of people do)
3)Shotgun spread your funds across a lot of different coins like a mutual fund and pray. :) (oddly this has worked for some people)
Depending on country, there are different exchange to purchase coins through. Look for reputable, country specific ones. I.e. for USA i used Coinbase for most USD to crypto transactions, then moved those cryptos to an exchange to purchase the altcoins i wanted.

Heard a few stories of people using Monero to get around Venezuelan govt crackdown on crypto users.

shotgun shitcoins can be profitable. look at people who go into verge early as shit, jumped 16000% during the surge.   
or things like MATIC which currently jumped 80% today. (though it has new backing by others like Binance and Coinbase, so probably not shit coin).
or even dogecoin is out performing S&amp;P

Your coins are always online, however the key to them can be offline. Y'all arguing semantics. Eitherway goodluck figuring out a seed password within a millenia, but yes store your seeds/keys offline.   
Black books are nice. So are hard wallets. perhaps both.

Cool, you lost everything. Be angry, refocus and restart because its not the end of life. Dont kill yourself over something so stupid as money. It can always be regained. 150k ish in debt is very recoverable. Think of the moguls who go into million or billions in debt and are able to restart and win in the end.
too bad its from the chans and is anonymous because the dude probably needs some help at the moment
edit1\* for anyone else in this predicament; you fucked up, alright now how do you get out of this jam?
well good thing (if you are in the US) bankruptcy is a thing; can definitely save you from a life of more misery , just accept that its your own doing and now you have to rebuild. 
Temporary homelessness may fix your perspective about life and maybe you wont hedge your entire life worth (plus some) on a single bet and learn about risk management and how to actually invest/bet to succeed (plenty of resources on this, perhaps start with classics on stock and bonds and move to volatile asset classes later).
all just a learning experience, and because you were unwilling to learn PRE-EMPTIVELY, you suffered from your own ignorance. Its merely a costly mistake, which are much better to be learned from observing/learning from OTHERS than your own experience.
