I had a giggle at this comment.
I'd say the *real* arguments against Bitcoin are centralization of miners (ASICs) and transactional scaling issues.

He could have bought in at $400 before it went up to $1500 before crashing down to $200. After it crashed, it went from $200 to $3000 over a couple years.

Never really said that bitcoin wouldn't work. I like the immutable rock that's distributed around the world.
I don't like that nation states control what's being written to it in form of mining pools.

You're exactly right. I have no idea why he's even trying to spread FUD in the first place other than attention.

Neither is BTC?

You go through several little ones instead. Cryptographically verifying your address.


I mean, this is mostly policies and politics and not actually anything fundamentally built into the system.
Cash is way more anonymous than BTC when all things are said and done. Unlike BTC, cash really can't be traced; at least not easily.

PoC coin that stores and verifies ledger transactions. Let individiuals split / store bits and pieces of the ledger. Put people's hundreds of TB storage nodes from Burstcoin to good use. There's your scale.

I mean, a will can be pretty important document making it worth storing. I figured there'd be some decent mechanism to store it.

Just for more input.

Oh, but using the capital just makes your coins more valuable.
Besides, the miners get the fees... could make it low priority to publish which could save, but that might split the message.
