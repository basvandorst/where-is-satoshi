Why would you even consider leaving that amount on the exchange

All I did was point out an objective fact and you jumped to conclusions. Come to LA and see for yourself, nobody calls it Cali. It's a dead giveaway you aren't from California
@_date: 2016-04-23 20:04:17
[You're wrong](
You got caught being a poser
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:26:14
80% of the state's population lives within 3 hours of LA. You need to realize you're the one who thought he'd be cool and call someone out, yet you are the one dumb enough not to know what he's talking about. I embarrassed you and proved my point, so now a poser like you wants to save face. Sorry little buddy, you lost
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:13:15
Nobody born and raised in California calls it Cali except people trying too hard to be cool
@_date: 2016-04-23 21:00:37
Poser is someone trying too hard to be cool when they aren't. Nobody native to California calls it Cali. I just disproved everything you said, so either say my bad or don't bother responding back. You're done
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:41:39
Sure but in our vernacular here in California, it's a dead giveaway that you aren't from here if you call it Cali

MDMA, LSD, mushrooms are all great for ptsd

It's a store of value. That's the whole point
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:19:38
That's the whole point of having other cryptocurrencies. If you've come to debate, do your homework. You can ban me from r/buttcoin, but don't bring your stupidity and lack of strategy here

I see you have never sent cash to 3rd world countries in an envelope. They'll steal your money 99% of the time before it ever arrives at its intended recipient. Don't be so naive

He probably read that somewhere and couldn't wait to use it on someone
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:55:34
I'd rather use circle than coin base
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:52:26
Circle is going to die without Bitcoin

$1100 ain't shit. Come back and brag at $1 million

They need to get a real job. Fucking sad

Hackers are waiting for the bait. You should delete this
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:46:48
You need a financial advisor. Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:55:34
You can barely buy a house with that, don't be naive
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:44:48
This is the kind of logic that helps keep poor people poor
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:32:25
If $1000 is a lot, do yourself a favor and save your money for more important shit. This isn't for you
