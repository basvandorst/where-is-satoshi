I definitely like the suggestion there about separating some of this out to the browser. On a desktop wallet that is definitely a good way to do it (and is already the natural way to do it for hardware wallets).
I'm not sure about how this applies to Samourai on Android, which should presumably already use TLS to talk to its own backend servers. For BIP70 I think all that's absolutely required (they could get away with not checking the merchant cert; it's not like BIP21 does anything along those lines) is to send a POST over HTTPS, which I don't think requires extra libraries beyond what the OS provides.

Posting this for visibility: u/0__________________-'s comment here is the answer: 
Basically there's a tiny bit more in PRIV_A1/2 than *just* the private key itself. Because of the encoding it looks like its completely different but actually most of it is the same. Not quite sure whether what Electrum does here is a good idea (I thought WIF should be universal) but it should at least be kosher with future Electrum versions.

@_date: 2018-01-14 03:33:16


No, this is wrong. You have to look at how the block rate compares to the targetted 1 block / 10 min in order to determine if difficulty is too high or too low.
The system is designed to hit that rate. It is not designed to try and adjust difficulty to empty the mempool faster. If it were then miners could very easily manipulate difficulty by spamming the mempool.

Commented as much on another thread about the Samourai blog post, but based on reading BIP70 this seems to completely misrepresent things and needlessly conflate the payment protocol with this ancient "redlisting" proposal. I also regard the criticism about PKI as utter bull...at worst you could just choose not to verify certs if you're really incapable of doing it safely.
BIP72 also specifies how to produce BIP21-compatible URIs, which AFAIK is what BitPay has been doing all this time. Any information about what is actually changing on BitPay's side?
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:28:57
I agree with your example; it's the same as if you just bought the BTC at the lower price. If your goal is to stay at the same USD value then an easier way is to just stay in USD :)
Just don't want anyone to think crypto-to-crypto trades are somehow tax-exempt because they don't involve USD. But you are right that this example trade doesn't involve a taxable gain.

Samourai is an Android SPV wallet that talks to Samourai servers already.

Software isn't uniquely a problem for HW wallets though.
I haven't set up a Ledger myself yet but I think there is a way to have it use a passphrase that is mixed with the seed to create the actual xpriv key. Unfortunately it's not the default mode of operation.

Maybe I just misunderstood what you meant by "it would be really hard for the IRS (or any tax agency) to really collect" then. I agree that this is not germane to the "argument".
I think we're posting at cross-purposes. It seems you're describing how you'd like the system to work based on logic and fairness. Meanwhile I think it's pretty clear the system actually does not work that way, and in particular I think it's crazy to think that crypto traders would be treated preferentially compared to commodities or stock traders.
Regarding "end of the day", yes in many cases you can do the accounting that way (because you can count capital losses too), but that is kind of beside the point since we're using different definitions of what is actually taxable in the first place.

I don't feel this is relevant. IMHO it is a civic duty to pay your taxes, whether you could get away without doing so just because the IRS isn't looking doesn't hold up as an argument in my eyes. I'm fine with following tax law as I understand it (my accountant agrees!) and I'd heartily urge anyone else to do the same. I'm sure there are plenty who don't view taxes this way.
It's on people to understand the "serious issues" before jumping in.

So BIP72 can be backwards compatible with BIP21. Is BitPay really planning to explicitly disable the more widely-supported format? Is there any info available on what BitPay is actually changing here (AFAIK they've already been using "payment protocol" thus far)?
This blog post seems a bit vague to me. Also, that BIP70 involves SSL-like certificates and therefore is bad "because heartbleed" seems like a very flawed perspective. A clearer explanation of how BIP70 leads to "an exposure to increased risk of AML/KYC surveillance and monitoring of on-chain transactions and more effective blacklists" would also be appreciated, because from reading BIP70 I don't really see where that's coming from, given that the protocol is mostly adding a bunch of metadata sent from the merchant to the customer.

I don't think the "parallel business" issue is in itself actually a problem. That is effectively a subsidy on the cost of mining and IMHO it would have a similar effect on the system as the variability of access to cheap electricity does today. Merged mining is sorta-kinda an example of this kind of extra revenue and in that case, it doesn't result in attacks because anyone can do it. Scientific researchers would also have an incentive to get \*every\* miner involved rather than just paying one.
But I agree with your premise that trying to base a POW system on something like scientific computation results in broken POW. The key issues would be:
\- who decides what computations are worth it? Bitcoin is a decentralized system
\- hashing is mathematically predictable. This is important in multiple ways, such as for tuning difficulty to keep the block time at 10 minutes and so that miners can determine their estimated revenue based on their hashrate
\- somewhat related to the above, but we are assuming that the hashing algorithm isn't broken (i.e. that there will definitely be \*work\* required). In the case of scientific research, the whole goal is different because we do research on things that we think will bear fruit---IOW there's some expectation that solving those problems will become easier or even trivial once we understand them well enough. I suppose "ASICBoost" is like a mini-example of what can go wrong when such breakthroughs happen.  
Overall though, I'm not worried at all about this. It simply wouldn't be bitcoin (but rather something else) if you based a cryptocurrency on that kind of mining scheme. Maybe it can work, but I think it would be better to not conflate the two things (and just let people devote cycles to research computing if they want to, which is a thing that has been happening for a long time already).

"ruining it for everyone"
What? pray tell how did this ruin anything? That picture shows a ton of low fee transactions, which is exactly what people should send if they have lots of low priority transactions and don't want to get in the way of others.
If your own node is getting overloaded then you could increase your own threshold and ignore those transactions (but this mempool size is not crazy large anyway...).
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:27:15
I should clarify: I'm not saying inflation is better than deflation. When I mentioned "this deflationary model", I was talking about the rate at which specifically Bitcoin decreases supply. The alternative model I suggested (which is just a strawman) would also be deflationary (given reasonable assumptions about real economy), just not as aggressively. 3/4 instead of 1/2 would also be an alternative (less contentious than what I proposed). By the same token if you imagine the extreme example of dropping the block reward by 99% every 1000 blocks then you could see that it's at least possible to screw up these parameters (the parameters being: initial block reward, how much + how often it drops, and the rate of new blocks).  
Overall my point is that the current parameters are not much more than a guess by Satoshi about what would work. So we should be careful to recognize that.
And I'm also not claiming to have "proof" of anything. Like I said this part of it is an experiment and we'll see how well it works. In \*theory\* the problem would be if spending is discouraged so much that the usage of the currency dries up. I agree that there will always be people that value it because it is "scarce", but IMHO if those are the only people that value it then it will have failed to achieve its goal of being a decentralized money.

Re timestamp my point is it's allowed to vary that (it doesn't have to be accurate to the second) and doing so is cheaper than recomputing a whole merkle tree from scratch. I'd assume this is already being taken advantage of. i.e. compute one merkle tree and then try mining with a spread of timestamps on it (in parallel) while you compute the next one.
My point about extra nonce was just to clarify that changing merkle hash as part of mining is not something that came about with ASICs (as the OP implied). AFAIK it was happening before that too.
The current network hash rate is on the order of 60 EH/s which is \~65 bits. If we would increase nonce size for this reason I'd advocate for 96 bits or 128 bits.
I generally agree with the idea behind your post; this would be a pretty cheap thing to do and the current approach is somewhat "inelegant" from the perspective of what the various fields in the block header are supposed to be for. If it was straightforward it probably would have been done by now. Though from the perspective of the network security, this doesn't matter much, and as others have replied, changing it now is difficult (there would need to be a strong reason to motivate a hard fork, such that there'd be no chance anyone would stay on the other side of it).
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:41:15
64-bits is still too small so I'm not sure why you'd propose stopping there. There is also the timestamp BTW.  
Anyway changing the merkle tree was actually already a thing before we got to current hash rates (what is new perhaps is doing so "intelligently"). "extraNonce" has been around forever. And anyway miners usually update with new transactions from the mempool pretty often.

You can set the timestamp to whatever you want. It does affect when the block will be acceptable but this isn't a big issue for OP's scenario. Needing to include the previous block's hash is what kills this idea.

Correct, but the reduction to 160 bits means you don't necessarily need to find the original key. A ton of them will produce the same result and you can stop once you hit one. In napkin math it means you're looking at 2^160 to start with.

The hardware wallet makes it easy to *use* the wallet without sacrificing security.
Encrypted wallet.dat is great for cold storage. It's problematic to use because it will be unencrypted at that time.
IMHO you should apply same security for the seed word list as you do for wallet.dat file; functionally the seed word list is the same as unencrypted wallet.dat. So I'd suggest only storing it in encrypted form.

So, that rate is exactly what you got. That implies they are including any fees you paid (do you know what the ATM takes for itself?), which TBH is a weird way to report the rate (it just makes them look worse).
If there are fixed fees involved then it would make sense that low amounts would get bad effective rates. I'm not sure how these ATMs are structured though (and also whether they make you pay the bitcoin tx fee on top).
E.g. suppose market rate is 1 BTC = 25k CAD, but there is a $5 fixed fee. If you put in $20, you'll get $15 worth: 0.0006 BTC, and the "effective price" is ~33k. If you put in $2000, you'll get $1995 worth: 0.0798 BTC, and the "effective price" is 25,062.
So it seems there was a hefty fee in there. Definitely shady if that wasn't communicated before it took your money.

Not *quite* sure what you're getting at. New blocks wouldn't be added if there were no miners or nodes, so it's not independent of human action. However this all happens by software talking to each other so there isn't any manual interaction needed beyond starting the software; hope it answers your question.


Yes; the "blockchain" is by definition/agreement the longest known chain of valid blocks starting from an agreed upon "genesis" block. "Mining" is just the process by which valid blocks are created (anybody can create a candidate block, but it has to satisfy a particular equation to be considered valid; miners just try variations of the block to make it so). You should know mining is essentially a random process (guess and check).


No. From the network's perspective, this is just the same as if the miners were just very unlucky. Due to random chance we often observe significant delays in block creation vs. the 10 minute target. And of course it gets worse on average if miners are doing something else (e.g. mining another coin).


Not exactly. Blocks do always contain at least one transaction, which is the reward for the miner that mined it (it is called "coinbase" and it is special, the miner can allocate that reward to whatever address it wants). It's explicitly stated in the protocol that a block without that is invalid. However, otherwise the block could be empty. This still provides value to the network by extending the chain and thus providing more security (proof-of-work) for the transactions that are in the chain.
But, maybe you were asking if there is anything needed other than transactions to create a valid block. The answer is basically no; a block is essentially just a bunch of transactions along with some metadata to link it to the current chain. You *do* need to know the current chain to be able to create a block; furthermore you do need to know a bunch of history to know whether transactions themselves are valid.


This is the target; the network tries to adjust the random chance of block validity to make this true. But it's random chance and also will change as miners join / leave / become more efficient / etc. The network retargets every 2015 blocks to try and correct, based on if the last 2015 blocks have been fast or slow.


There is no time limit. Also it's not like there is a fixed "puzzle"; the only part that is mostly* fixed is the previous block hash (i.e. the current top of the chain). Miners can (and do) vary things like which transactions are included and even their ordering in the effort to find a valid block that extends the chain.
*I said mostly because sometimes different parts of the network may be working on slightly different chains. Eventually one of them becomes obsolete, IIRC we have never seen this last for more than 5 blocks, and that is very rare.


Not quite. The guaranteed "subsidy" for a block is currently exactly 12.5 bitcoin. On top of that, miners are able to claim any excess bitcoin from the transactions included in the block (these are called "fees", and so miners would tend to prefer including transactions that have higher fees). This "reward" (12.5 + fees) defines the maximum input to the coinbase transaction; technically miners are allowed to claim anything up to that, but taking less is probably a bug. You're correct about how the subsidy is scheduled to decrease over time.


If people are still using Bitcoin, the reward will consist entirely of fees at this point. Also, a nitpicky point: this isn't based on the 21M Bitcoin, but rather that limit is a consequence of the halving of subsidy. Bitcoin only has 8 decimal places, so after enough halvings we'll get to 1 satoshi, and at the next halving the subsidy is rounded down to 0. The 21M limit is derived from this (actually the precise limit is 20999999.97690000; this assumes miners always claim the full subsidy and I think that's already no longer the case).

If you think part of the definition is that they know about it, you've got some misconceptions about how US taxes work.
Dummy example
January 2017: BTC worth $1, you buy 1
December 2017: BTC worth $100, BCH worth $1. You trade your 1 BTC for 100 BCH.
March 2018: BCH goes to $0.50. You panic and sell your 100 BCH for $50.
The trade in Dec. is a taxable gain (short-term in this example). Even if you didn't actually *use* USD, your buying power is measured in USD for tax purposes. When you make this trade you are realizing $99 of profit in order to transact with someone else.
The trade in March is a capital loss of $50. But you can't use it to offset gains from 2017. Whether this matters or not depends on your overall tax situation &amp; liquidity (in the end it is essentially equal no matter what you do, aside from the short-term capital gains part).
EDIT: I should mention I am not a tax lawyer or an accountant. Also it's *possible* that a clever accountant could convince the IRS to treat different cryptocurrencies as "like-kind" assets in which case you could defer taxation until you actually buy pizzas or Lambos (you still owe tax on the same amount overall, but such a rule would make it easier to do it at lower rates). The absolute truth is we really just don't know yet, but I think most everybody doubts that the IRS would give such a favourable treatment to cryptocurrencies.

The PIN is not needed if someone knows your seed words. What the PIN protects is access to your ledger itself, so that without the PIN it can't be used to access your wallet.

I'm not too familiar with blockchain.info interface. AFAIK, unless you explicitly imported an address at some point, it would be based on your seed words. I think you'd have mentioned that so I'm assuming you never did that.
So when you say "someone transferred the entirety of it into another wallet" do you mean that this is showing up under your wallet's transactions? I presume it links to the transaction id, which you can lookup &amp; see exactly what addresses were input &amp; output.
Also in blockchain.info looks like you can go to settings -&gt; addresses -&gt; "manage" (link to the right of "My Bitcoin Wallet") to see all addresses associated with your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:20:27
So it's looking like in fitwear's case, the error was not due to  blockchain.info. The going theory is that he, while trying to import a paper wallet private key into blockchain.info, put the public address into some tool that read it as a brainwallet passphrase.
If the address you lost funds from was generated by blockchain.info then it is unlikely to be the same issue. 
Specifically, if you can restore that address using your 12 seed words, then it means that somebody knows those seed words.

I would posit that "net energy consumption goes up" is also largely independent of Bitcoin. It's not up to Bitcoin (meaning, the design of Bitcoin) to figure out how to keep energy consumption in check, given that it does allow participants to freely choose how much or how little energy they want to put in. It's just like any other way one can use energy, though in some ways purer (the utility is geographically invariant, and there is very little overhead in terms of energy so ROI is similar for very big and very small scales).
And if as a society we hit energy walls and start taking more drastic measures than we currently do (which I think is definitely a possibility), for example start limiting energy use for "non-essential" things in order to guarantee basic functions, the beauty of Bitcoin is that it actually can adapt fine to this (it would be a problem if this happened overnight, but if it happened over time, everything should work just fine). The main benefit of pouring energy into Bitcoin is to make the blocks irrefutable because it would be difficult for a bad actor to match that investment, so if the energy available for that purpose becomes limited for everyone, we actually don't lose much even if scaled down relative to today.
This is also very idealistic but maybe we'd start to see miners going off grid and investing in their own energy production too. I think that kind of spirit is very much in line with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies.
As a clear example of a misconception that some (not sure if this applies to you) have, I've seen a lot of these stories about Bitcoin energy use talk about the energy per transaction. Which is a completely bogus number: the high energy usage is not correlated at all with the number of transactions. Ignoring the other technical limitations, if we had 1000x the transactions in current blocks, the energy use would be largely the same. There would be some minor increase due to the *data* involved, but that is orders of magnitude below the overall input (not to mention I don't think anybody is even counting the non-mining energy today).

Disclaimer: I'm not familiar with what specific procedures miners / mining pools use these days. This is mostly based on knowledge of the protocol.
  
Miners can include whichever (valid) transactions they want. So it's ok if they miss something that was recently added to mempool. Of course they are incentivized to stay relatively up-to-date so that they can grab as many fees as possible. So basically, periodically the mempool is re-evaluated to see if there are different / new transactions worth including (and of course they are also watching for any new blocks published by other miners, since if there is one they should mine on top of that to avoid wasting effort on a block that likely won't survive).  
The block hash also incorporates information about the \*current\* block, particularly the merkle root hash of the transactions in the block + the coinbase transaction (which is the miner paying themselves the reward + fees). The miner can play with the details of those to try and meet the difficulty target when they run out of bits in the nonce.
Varying the nonce is easiest so you'd generally try all nonce values before doing other stuff. Changing the transactions requires more work (because of recomputing the merkle root). If you do more research into this you'll probably come across "extraNonce" which is actually talking about modifying the coinbase transaction in a way that doesn't change its meaning but affects the merkle root.
You may also remember / come across the term "ASICBoost". That is sort of related to the idea of hashing blocks without varying the nonce (though the details are way too technical to get in to here, and I'm not up to date on the state of this anyway).

It's a bad idea. There's no way (IMHO) to even enforce it, and seems very likely to open up some exploitable vectors for bad nodes. Changing the definition of a "valid block" so fundamentally is a non-starter. Not to mention we can't even apply this definition of validity retrospectively, unless we start storing snapshots of the mempool state or something; we need to be able to determine validity of a block not just at the instant it got mined, but at any point in the future too.
Also, which tx's to include in a block is really a knapsack problem, and saying you have to use the suboptimal greedy solution is stupid. A very small tx is easier to fit into the block and so in principle could get by with a much lower fee, for example. Anyway it's part of the fundamental design that we incentivize miners to get clever about solving this problem; trying to dictate how they do it is counterproductive.
No question that centralization is a problem. But Antpool is only ~20% of overall hashrate so they can't act with impunity. With Antpool there is also the confounding factor of alterior motives to make Bitcoin worse to promote BCash.
IMHO what this highlights is: don't assume what you see in the mempool is all there in good faith, which is what every fee setting algorithm I've seen does. Being assertive about what fees you think a TX is worth is important to keep miners in check.

I think this is the one aspect of Bitcoin which is hard to tell if Satoshi got right. The choice to go for such an aggressively deflationary schedule was definitely at least partially subjective (I'm not saying it would necessarily be possible to come to the "right" decision objectively, overall this is a bit of an experiment).  
If we think of a world where bitcoin is used for a significant portion of the economy, and are willing to subscribe to the idea that the "real value" in the economy actually does increase over time (very debatable), then this deflationary model could become a problem in the sense of discouraging spending (or maybe we already see this: HODL).  
Personally I'd be more comfortable with a model where the issuance rate decays but not to zero (clamps to some minimum floor value). The only crucially important part is that the issuance is algorithmic and set in stone (so of course, I'm not advocating we should change it now: that wouldn't be Bitcoin).

BCash and Bitcoin use the same address format. So when you send to an address, you need to ensure you're transacting on the chain you intended.
OP wanted to send funds to his Coinbase Bitcoin wallet; let's say the receiving address was A.
OP mistakenly told Shapeshift to send his money to A on the BCash chain, when he meant to send it to A on the Bitcoin chain.
So, right now A on BCash has some funds in it, and A on Bitcoin does not.
Coinbase, which created address A, is technically able to move those coins on either chain, because they know the corresponding private key. But, since they don't support BCash, OP can't do this via their website. A tech on their side has to do it and could send the BCash to an address that OP controls; then OP would shapeshift it into BTC or whatever.

Core has worked this way forever. Generally it's accepted that reusing addresses is a bad idea because it unnecessarily reveals public keys.
If you're complaining about a particular wallet changing behaviour to this way, then maybe consider doing so in a more focused forum or mailing list? That said, IMHO if you're using a paper wallet in an incremental fashion then it's up to you to know what you're doing, and any "old-timer" doing this should know how to explicitly make the wallet do what they want vs relying on default behaviours.

I don't think this is a sensible idea. Basically it's like tricking miners into doing work they didn't sign up for.
If anybody wants to put energy into numerical simulations, nothing stops them from doing it today (and certainly some people do do that). Projects like GIMPS have been going on for decades.
It's disingenuous to act like the miners who *are* putting energy into bitcoin are wasting it. It's their decision and they think it's a worthwhile usage of energy. The fact that a *lot* of energy gets put in is not a failing...that's what makes the chain so secure.

That is actually true (in a weird sense of "created"; you *can* send to any valid address even if nobody has generated it as a receiving address), but what plumbforbtc means is that if you change one or two characters in an address, you won't end up with an address; it will just be an invalid string of characters.

The fee is unrelated to how much BTC is moving. The key is how big (bytes) the transaction is. The main contributor to that is # of inputs, as each one is signed separately.
Segwit inputs give you a discount on the size of signature. Schnorr allows them to be combined, making transactions with lots of inputs dramatically smaller. See  and  for details.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:02:13
It's like scenario B. I would phrase it a bit differently though. It's a probabilistic argument.
Suppose you're doing your brute force, trying all possible 256-bit private keys. For each key you will do whatever operations to end up with the 160-bit address. If that matches your target, you're done, else keep going.
Now if we assume nothing particular about the address generation, and model it as an arbitrary uniform mapping, for each private key you try you have a 1 in 2^160 chance of hitting your target. So the *expected* number of attempts you'll need is 2^160.
This is not a guarantee. For some particular target, it's technically possible that there actually is only one private key that will give you that hash (I don't think we can actually prove or disprove that such a key exists one way or the other, but we do know it is tremendously unlikely to exist, and even if it does exist, very unlikely that anyone ever used it). I also don't know how uniform the mapping from 256-bit keys to 160-bit addresses actually is, but at least the intent of using a couple of unrelated hash functions is to make this uniform.
BTW a related point is no matter what the algorithm, you have no idea whether you found the same key as the original (by the above, it is very likely that you didn't).

Segwit transactions are smaller, so there is just more of a chance that they'll fit in where nothing else does.
i.e. suppose I fill up my block with the highest fee transactions, and there are 150 bytes left over. There may not be any high-fee txes that fit in 150 bytes. So if it is a choice between nothing and stuffing in a small segwit tx, miner would pick the latter, irrespective of the fees on that tx. They would probably choose the segwit tx with the highest fees out of the ones that fit, though.
This could happen for any small tx but the chances are higher for smaller segwit tx's.

This is a rather big stretch I think. Would it count if I've never even created a BCH wallet? If I happen to know there is value on the BCH chain that nobody in the world can control without the secret numbers that only (hopefully) I have, does that really mean I've acquired them? If someone stuffs an envelope full of cash into my mailbox, is it my property (my problem) at that instant or do I need to open the mailbox &amp; envelope first? And then there's the folks who may be blissfully unaware (as I was about CLAM coin for a while). Treating them as negligent seems unfair, but taxing someone just because they knew about an alt chain seems silly too.
Do I also need to worry about all the other forks? I probably don't even know all of them (is Bitcoin Diamond a real thing yet?)
Strange to think about, because even importing the keys into a BCH wallet doesn't change anything real (I suppose an argument could be made as to intent here). I just don't see the justification for considering such a non-event as taxable (taxing proceeds of the sale of such coins assuming cost-basis 0 I can wrap my head around, though).
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:21:47
Yes, in fact anyone who knew about that transaction could retransmit it. It would need to be mined again to become part of the chain, but (unless you used a locktime) the transaction itself would be considered valid unless the coins involved were also spent on the real chain.  
Typical node software (e.g. Bitcoin Core) would just forget about the invalid blocks once it learns about the new chain. But at least in theory, if you have  a record of the orphaned transaction you could try to mine it on the real chain. In fact miners would probably be incentivized to do just that because those transaction fees are just sitting there unclaimed otherwise.  
So if something like this happened, I'd expect people (incl. miners) would soon realize that it happened, and so would be taking steps to record the transactions such that they could replay them on the merged chain. But by the same token, as soon as people realize they are likely on the orphaned side, they would stop accepting payments because of the risk of (eventual) double spends.

Hmm, sorry re resources, this is actually not using much particular knowledge about the crypto, just basic facts about the lengths. It may help to imagine a much smaller version of it; maybe read up on probability if you're not already familiar?
Probing the uniformity of the space is beyond me. Without analysing the details of SHA and RIPEMD, I don't know what you could do besides:
a) assuming uniformity like I did above
b) do a bunch of trials, but it's impossible to do a big enough sample to be representative
Meanwhile those functions are designed to be hard to analyse. Essentially finding non-uniformity in them amounts to a kind of attack (one hash value being rare necessitates another one is more common than expected).
That said I bet a crypto expert could say more than just "it's probably uniform", such as putting an upper bound on standard deviation or something.
The .0...001% thing goes both ways. Your target would have to be insanely lucky to fall in there. Equally, you'd end up hitting virtually everyone if you considered all addresses as targets.

In your example: no you don't need multiple transactions. But having to use 20 separate inputs does push the transaction size (and thus the fee) up.
Segwit reduces the impact of the number of inputs. Schnorr signatures would basically eliminate it (it doesn't help for coins that are fragmented *now* though).
If your coins are split across different *wallets*, then it makes it a PITA to create the single transaction, but basically you can do it by exporting the relevant private keys and importing them all into a single wallet (or standalone tool for creating raw transactions).

Most of us on this sub do believe Bitcoin is undervalued even now (long-term, at least). So, it's not a crazy idea that invest in Bitcoin == good chance of making money. It's certainly been true for hodlers thus far.
However, it is a trap to think this strategy is ironclad. If you are disciplined enough to commit to never investing again after 35% stop triggers, then yeah you won't lose more than that (ignoring slippage; come to your own conclusions about how much of a risk there is of that). But, this is exactly what people don't do and exactly how people lose money investing in all kinds of markets. You'll reinvest, probably on the way back up so losing a bit more in the process, and fail to catch the knife the next time it falls, rinse and repeat. It is death by a thousand cuts if you assume this kind of strategy will save you.
In Bitcoin case it is attractive because it is fundamentally strong (at least, that's our belief here), and you're thinking: the stop triggering is such a remote possibility, let's focus on what happens if it never triggers. TBH this would likely work out, not because of the strategy but because of the underlying asset keeping you away from the worst case. If having the trailing stop helps you sleep at night I suppose that is nice. It's good to remember that when you're selling, you have to find someone on the other side who is buying at that price...is there any reason to think you're outsmarting them?
Finally, please don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Especially in this kind of ecosystem, where all the exchanges are varying levels of fly-by-night.

Wouldn't they need to pay out shares of this reward to the pool members? Unless you're saying the pool members are all colluding or they somehow don't notice?
I think there are plenty of shenanigans pool operators can get up to, but a lot of them are hard to conceal, and definitely anything involving the actual mined blocks is plain for anyone to see.
EDIT: also if anyone is using an "average" to calculate fees then they're pretty much guaranteed to pay more than necessary. If those are widespread then that is a significant source of artificial fee inflation right there.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:05:39
1. Miners do both at the same time.
2. Creator of transaction determines the fee. Everyone can see this as soon as you broadcast it; so it's no use trying to "trick" the other party. It's up to the recipient when to consider it "complete" and give you whatever you paid for (presumably there's been an agreement about the conditions beforehand).
To elaborate a bit: I think it might be a bit misleading to think of miners' role as "processing" the transactions. It is true that they do that, but really everybody verifies the transactions and invalid ones won't even propagate to miners. What miners do is produce valid *blocks* of transactions; this is designed to require significant computation (~10 minutes of worldwide effort) so not just anyone can do it (and importantly, once we have a decently long chain going, it's very unlikely that anybody could possibly do enough computation to produce an alternative chain, which is why we are willing to trust entries in this chain are permanent).
In order to incentivize miners to spend time / effort doing that, they get the ability to give themselves (or anyone they like, really) some new coins + any excess "fees" from the transactions they include. IOW transaction "fee" is just the inputs minus the outputs of each transaction. Obviously it would be invalid to have the inputs be less than the outputs (in fact there used to be a bug related to this that led to an impressive, though short-lived, hack). But otherwise it's up to you how much you'll overpay by; the reason you would overpay at all is to attract miners to include your transaction over someone else's.
Also for the low fee case, there is a thing called "child-pays-for-parent". So even if you sent a transaction with low fee, the recipient of that transaction has a chance to get it mined faster, by making their own transaction that spends the unconfirmed funds, and paying a high enough fee for both transactions together. In this sense, the unconfirmedness of the transaction is not really any advantage to the sender*, because they've already told the world that the receiver controls these coins. It's inconvenient for the receiver but they do have a recourse.
*assuming most senders do not really have the capability / know-how to execute a double-spend: a separate transaction that sends the coins somewhere else, which if it gets mined first, renders the original one invalid.

This is a misconception. The increase in consumption is chewing up available cheap supply. It stops as soon as it's no longer worth it; there isn't a built-in requirement in the technology that is pushing it higher (technically there is a very tiny minimum energy requirement, but it's insignificant). The network is currently very strong because it can afford to put that much energy into mining.
The economic solution is the right one; start charging more for (non-renewable) energy and you'll temper consumption (and/or drive people to invent more efficient sources).

"unresolved" is the right way to describe it before the new tax plan.
But generally, one assumes the less favorable interpretation (in this case, that various cryptos are not "like-kind") when there is nothing to say definitively either way.
If someone does convince the IRS to consider such transactions as like-kind then that is great. I'm not holding my breath for it. I also wouldn't personally consider such trades to fit the spirit of "like-kind" provision; generally the reason for such trades is to *diversify* into cryptos with wildly different features.
The clarification in the new bill is good since it removes the uncertainty. It doesn't imply that the situation was different before, only that now they are very explicit about what the rule is. Outside of crypto, like-kind has been a pretty gross source of tax loopholes so I'm very happy about anything that improves on it.

What the miners can't do is violate the rules defining what is a valid transaction. E.g. they can't steal somebody else's coins no matter how much hash power they have. Nodes will reject chains that violate those rules.
There's some relevant discussion on this topic here: 
A scenario I thought up: 51% gives miners more confidence in knowing they will be the ones defining the longest chain. In addition to double spend (which is probably the worst issue) it would also facilitate manipulation, e.g. flooding the market with their own high-fee transactions in order to push fees up; if they know they will mine the block then they'll get all those fees back, whereas usually this is risky because other miners can grab them.
If they're particularly brazen they could start charging off-chain fees to include transactions in their blocks. Like tx accelerators except required.

What I meant by my post is that the timer is not for first confirmation (15 minutes is a silly value for this, even if the network is working perfectly as designed, because it *aims* for 10 minutes and there's a good chance it will be &gt; 15 minutes). The timer is just supposed to be for the transaction to appear in the mempool, so usually it is seconds after you hit "send" in your wallet before they see it.
15 minutes is their window where the price is fixed. It's pretty generous considering for most people this should take no more than a minute or two.
Maybe OP's wallet (did he say which one he's using?) was having trouble connecting to the network or something like that. It definitely sucks that this happened to him (and I hope the support people will come through for him with more than a partial refund), but this event is 1) not so much related to Ledger as it is to BitPay, and 2) not the usual experience with BitPay. The main point is that the 15 minutes is not for confirmation and so it is actually a very reasonable timeout window.

Yes, it does (unless some miners are feeling kind, which they aren't stopped from being). It's a choice between a zero floor or a non-zero floor, and I do not see how the former scales at all.

They're saying it in a very misleading way IMHO.  
If you think about it, of course somebody is going to know what you're spending on. Because the whole idea of a credit card is that somebody else is paying instead of you. I could believe that Apple may stay out of it, and maybe even that the third party won't be "storing" anything beyond the time needed to complete a transaction.
But it begs some questions:
1) Is it actually better for Apple to not know if it means trusting some other third party to responsibly know? I'd think most Apple customers would trust Apple more with this data than any other companies.
2) How the heck are they going to have fraud detection without looking at the details of payments?
3) If your phone dies does it really mean \*nobody\* has a record of what you paid for and when?

No, in this scenario B doesn't even interact with the Bitcoin network and they don't even need to be online. However A has to learn B's receive address somehow, so A probably can know B's IP.
Similarly if it is an exchange sending to B's address, then the address would likely know B's IP from when B logs in and initiates the withdrawal. But that information isn't communicated to the Bitcoin network.
The Bitcoin network does in principle know the IP address of A's node / exchange's node when they broadcast the transaction. It's not part of the protocol to persist that anywhere but sophisticated actors could try to own lots of nodes &amp; actively log this information. That said, IMHO IP address of a node is not actually that meaningful.


You can tell some things if the address is of a type that a particular wallet doesn't support, and/or is not the default for that wallet. E.g. if you see an old-style P2PKH address that would probably rule out a bunch of modern wallets with high probability.
I don't think you could ever narrow down to a specific manufacturer / software package. If there was a wallet with that kind of unique "signature" nobody would use it.


No. B's receiving address doesn't reveal anything about their relationship to A. B doesn't even have to exist. Though if B's address looks like an obvious burn address (most of the characters clearly spell a word) then you could conclude that they very likely don't exist (there is of course a chance).


I'm not sure if I completely understand the scenario (because I'm not sure why you mention Xpub).
Assuming the husband can see the coins sitting there since 2014, he can also obviously see when one of them moves.
Bitcoin itself does not say anything about whether it was the wife or someone else who created that transaction. Obviously for it to be someone else, it means that someone obtained the seed (either before the Nano was lost, or by obtaining and unlocking the Nano). If one can reasonably assume that the seed was kept securely &amp; that the Nano had a strong passphrase, then it's also reasonable to conclude that the wife actually does have control over the coins. Whether she specifically has access to the Nano or had the keys / seed backed up somewhere else is not possible to distinguish.
It is not at all likely that someone has control over one of the addresses but not the rest if they are all generated from the same seed and were only used with the Nano.

Never claim forked coins from "hot" addresses.  
Move your Bitcoin first. And don't run shitcoin wallets outside of a secure environment (i.e. sandbox them to hell; if you've got a separate computer to do it on even better).
Ideally there's a way to generate the txn offline (airgapped) and submit it to the network yourself, but shitcoins are called that for a reason so most likely, this wouldn't be feasible.

This is the only kind of solution to this "problem" which I support.  
Any changes on the 1st layer about privacy would change Bitcoin into not-Bitcoin...a public &amp; transparent distributed ledger is the heart of Bitcoin's design. 
And that design's answer to the issue of miner censorship \*is\* decentralization. Arguing that bitcoin doesn't have a defense against this while taking centralized mining as an axiom is a disingenuous argument IMHO.
Also, this part of the article is pretty misleading IMHO:


For the money to be "effectively frozen", those 51% of miners would be conducting a potentially very expensive attack for an indefinite period of time. They not only have to ignore the blacklisted transactions, but also outwork any fork with a block containing those transactions mined by the other 49% of the network. And yes 51% is enough to eventually succeed at that, but you'd really want a much larger majority to make this feasible without cutting your own legs off.
@_date: 2019-10-21 06:21:02
The OP either doesn't understand how a hard fork works, or they are intentionally obscuring their understanding of the difference between the date of the fork vs. the date of pre-fork transactions to justify their interpretation of the tax guidance.
I'd be the first to agree the guidance around hard forks is loopy (I must point out that the article does the questionable conflation of hardforks and airdrops that the IRS also did: these are different things that should be considered separately) but this article was mostly a waste of time to read through.

I'm not super familiar with latest implementations. I don't think there's an infallible way to ask the network (I think it's unavoidable that if you admit lacking knowledge, there's an incentive to lie to you).
Trying a cooperative close first would make sense though. Best case it goes through.
One point is that any channel update must have been signed by you. So in principle you could ensure this is logged / backed up before sending it out, s.t. you should be able to know if you have the most recent state or not. It's definitely a fair complaint if this isn't done for you by the software, though it's still beta software.

Protip for Gemini  
If you're a new user and technically minded there's a sweet deal on API trades.
Within the first 30-days you can qualify for the highest tier which means \*zero\* fee for maker.
Obviously this doesn't work long-term. But if you've got a lump sum and are trying to figure out where to sign up and get it in to BTC, I think this is a very good option. \*and\*, the API rates are in general better than active trader rates esp. for makers, so it's worth considering even after the 30-days. The downside being of course that there is no UI and it's definitely easier to make a mistake.
If you are not intending to day-trade &amp; know Python, then I think this is pretty feasible. Basically just write a short python script with hardcoded values to execute the trade: you don't need to build a whole trading platform to do this.
One issue I did hit is that I didn't manage to get the API to accept an order for the full amount as it kept coming back with insufficient funds. I couldn't tell if it was just not considering the discount, or if it was applying the worst-case taker fee as a requirement (I was placing my order as "maker-or-cancel" though). So I didn't get completely 0-fees: I held a small percentage back and later used a regular web order to buy with that &amp; zero my cash balance. I can confirm that the API order actually did not have any fees charged.

Because the price is high for everyone, including those who have a more efficient setup (cheap electricity) than you do.

HODLers or people who lost coins are functionally doing the same thing as if they were offering to sell their BTC for infinity dollars.
The value goes up when people are willing to buy at the current lowest sell price. So if coins are tied up at infinity and not available for trading, that tends to make coins that are available for trading that much more valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:59:42
This is why people need to stop paying fees based on what is in the mempool (and then complaining the fees are too high), and instead pay fees based on *what they consider is a fair price* (of course, never pay *more* than what the mempool state dictates is sensible).
Blindly paying the "fastest confirmation" fee just opens up the fee market to shady manipulation, especially in the present environment of miners that control a lot of hash power.

nit: the point operation used in ECC is usually referred to as an addition instead of multiplication; and then it's scalar multiplication (not exponentiation) that is used for private -&gt; public transformation. At some level this is just a convention (though use of addition does tend to imply the operation is commutative), but worth sticking to since pretty much every reference on ECC uses it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:24:22
It's pretty much the same as sending them cash in an envelope. The main difference is that the blockchain can be used to irrefutably prove that you sent the funds (though the other person could try to claim they were not sent to *them*).

IMHO this is a bad example because the developer in question was just stupid (not to mention the subsequent "fix" which just nullifies the fork activation logic). Nobody would take this as a serious "cautionary tale": since the entire purpose of the change was to activate the fork at a certain block, it's just boneheaded to not actually test that it does that.
But even good programmers *can* make tricky off-by-one errors. It's best to teach by illustrating how that can happen.
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:56:50
The limit is meaningless when blocks aren't full. So increasing it when blocks are near full is basically like having no limit at all.
Your proposal really just moves the "quarrel" from "what is the block size limit" to "what are the conditions when the algorithm should change the block size limit". It does not seem like an easier argument (note also there are people out there wanting to \*decrease\* the limit from where it is).
FYI the current mechanism for relieving block capacity pressure is fees. And I'll also point out explicitly that it is \*not a goal\* of the system to handle transactions that are underpaying fees.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:09:45
Arguable; it does make sense if you understand discrete log to mean the inverse of the repeated group operation (whether that operation itself is termed addition, multiplication, or something else) and we do use this terminology for other abelian groups. Or we could call it something else like discrete point division. Anyway it was just a nit.
One of the key strengths of ECC is that discrete logs in this context are (as far as we know) harder than in Z_p, hence why ECC can provide equal cypher strength with smaller key lengths. So, it's worth acknowledging the difference between the ECC version of discrete log from the classic one.

+1. I think a lot of the "fees are too high" complaints are due to using fee-estimation algorithms that are too willing to spend. If everyone uses those then it's kind of a positive feedback loop that pushes fees higher and higher for no real reason; the only downward pressure on fees in the design relies on people actively *choosing* the level of fee they want to pay.
Meanwhile miners are happy to include my transactions with &lt; 50 satoshi/byte fees. While it's true we can't support micropayments with that kind of fee (bigger blocks will never solve that!), it's totally fine for typical low-dollar things like buying a pizza.

Nope, the receiving address doesn't even need to be real (it does have to pass a checksum but that's it). You could generate it completely offline and send to it without ever letting your Ledger (or whatever) see the internet.
Think of it like this: the transaction sending coins from A to B is actually saying something like:
Hey Bitcoiners, I have control over the coins assigned to address A. Here's a fancy math demonstration involving the number A to prove it.
Henceforth, I declare that these coins are assigned to address B. So in the future, if someone comes along doing fancy math with the number B, we'll all agree that they have control of these coins.
I have dramatically oversimplified and fudged the details here (technically the math is done with \*a different number\* that nobody can figure out just given A). But the point is that an address is not really an identifier of a person, but rather more like instructions that tell the network how to recognize the owner when they later show up.
All that said, in theory someone could determine the IP of the \*spender\* when they do the fancy math. If you're concerned about it, use a VPN I guess.

It's a fair point, and I'm not sure whether the design of Bitcoin (in particular how difficulty adjustments happen) really addresses this kind of attack (throw a ton of hashpower to push the difficulty up, and then abandon it causing everything to slow down / stall). The only real counter is the block rewards / fees that incentivize miners to stay. If they feel another chain is more profitable (or can become so eventually after they kill bitcoin) then we're in trouble.
The impact kind of depends on when the fork lies w.r.t. scheduled difficulty retargeting (can someone comment on that?). I wonder if there would be consensus for an accelerated difficulty adjustment, but this is maybe too similar to what is happening with Bitcoin Cash to be a reasonable approach (and pretty unrealistic to imagine it could be done quickly).

You are right. I mean technically someone could have sent to a segwit P2SH before the activation since the format was known, but it would be a crazy thing to do.
So does it mean every output "hacked" here was someone trying to transact on BTC but accidentally transacting on BCH? And unless I misunderstood something, this attack required that the segwit output gets spent on BTC chain; so did who ever spent that not realize the address had appeared on BCH chain, or did they just not care?

Congestion is a very weird word for this...what problem do you think this could cause? In fact nodes could choose not to relay them if they were causing an issue (which is an important way nodes have a voice on the network).
What matters is what is the top (w.r.t. fee-per-byte) ~1MB of the mempool. Though it's a little more nuanced since the absolute transaction size also matters (as miner builds a block, smaller transactions get a chance to squeeze in even if they're paying lower-than-market fees, due to knapsack-nature of this task).
At the top I think we can see evidence of suboptimal fee estimation (and personally I think over time this does tend to inflate fees). Not sure there's any basis to say this is "bad actors" though.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:01:32
This is true, but it doesn't really affect the profitability of mining over the long term (in the short term, yes you could get lucky and get paid before the difficulty rises too much). It affects the variance of payouts, and so you would mine in a pool to have roughly the same expected value (minus pool overhead / costs) but a steadier flow of income.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:16:18
Other comments have pointed out where you're wrong about segwit adoption. More generally, they're just leaving money on the table by not supporting segwit...you sound like a conspiracy nut saying they're not interested in implementing it. It's not the simplest thing to do especially since many consumer wallets don't support it either. Give it time.
I haven't dealt with all of these companies, but as long as they are upfront about fees then I don't have any problem. In my experience it's the case for BitPay and Shapeshift, and the fees you're talking about are not ones that the client is forced to pay, but rather ones that the company pays on aggregate transactions so they can guarantee service.
Do we really need a "PSA" to tell people they should shop around for the best deal? No. Most of this post is unsubstaniated FUD. Maybe stick to complaining about hard facts.

I think you're making the mistake of assuming there is guaranteed to be a winner in a given "drawing".
Yes it would be bad to repeat work that's been done before. But that doesn't mean that avoiding repeated work somehow lets you beat the odds; the hash attempts are independent and each one has the same probability of meeting the difficulty target (that probability is dictated exactly by the difficulty). It's not really like a lottery with a finite number of tickets and you're just looking through them trying to find a winning one---the tickets are getting printed on demand with a fixed probability of producing a winner.

You should look into how that site does its estimation. It's not really a good way to set your fees.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:24:05
6 confirms in 15 mins is an anomaly, the goal is 6 blocks per hour. There's some variance expected on that due to math; right now things are still out of whack due to altcoin shenanigans.
Anyway, when evaluating fee situation, look at how many actual blocks were mined &amp; skipped your tx. If you look only at minutes you're conflating it with network slowness, which is not related to your fee. Anything past 1 confirm is also not related to your fee.

I will HODL for at least a day (and maybe more...just can't be bothered). If I miss out on early cash-ins so be it. Made sure to already spend what Bitcoin I was planning to in the near future; otherwise this is pretty much the same as if 2x wasn't happening.
Maybe I'll be tempted if the value is high enough (like, BCash levels?). I'll be more involved in watching to see how many "large blocks" they actually have and what the effect on fees would be (did they update any fee estimation in their client)? At least this data can be interesting.

I don't think this is viable for the upcoming fork, but I think it's conceivable to have a way for difficulty retarget to be triggered sooner when blocks are slow. E.g. by considering walltime as well.
The current mechanism works well for adapting to increases in hashrate (it reacts sooner for sharper increases), but punishes the network in the event of drops. An issue with using walltime is that there is no authoritative source of time. Maybe some protocol by which miners can vote &amp; agree that "blocks are too slow". The main scary thing is how to ensure miners can't game it, because they would definitely try. IDK but perhaps a difficulty-insensitive POW (like pool shares) could be used for this somehow.

If you don't mind sharing the public addresses or transaction ids, it may be easier to understand what happened. You can also look these up yourself on e.g. blockchain.info to see what the network thinks. Feel free to PM me.
Not too sure about multibit which according to the site is no longer supported. You may want to take a look at  also (after that put those keys into a different wallet such as Electrum). Were you using multibit HD or the older one?
However, most likely your coins are *fine* and this is a bug in multibit losing track of them. You would lose coins if either 1) the software actually lost the private key somehow and you have no backups of the wallet or 2) somehow your last transaction actually emptied your wallet instead of spending the amount you intended. It doesn't sound like  happened.

From what I've seen so far (which is admittedly very indirect), this isn't much more than a different label in the app + an "exchange rate"...there's no evidence that there's any real bitcoin behind it at all.
If they disclose their reserves strategy and it looks credible then it may be safe (vs. a dressed up ponzi scheme). But AFAICT there's no way to get BTC out of their system so it doesn't really help broader adoption of Bitcoin.

This seems to be a usability issue with the wallet; 50 sat/byte should be fine a lot of the time in my experience (at very least you should have the option to choose that).
I do wonder how much of high fees is a result of wallet users not being able to choose fees as low as they would want. It's true that even if that was fixed, we'd still have more txn's in mempool than can go into a block (so we're definitely supply-constrained) but at least smaller transactions could appear more viable.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:26:34
More and more I'm starting to feel this is a majorly underappreciated issue (not sure if I'm turning into a nutjob posting about it repeatedly).
In this kind of system there isn't any downward pressure on fees. One simple idea would be to take whatever current algorithms give and push it down by a few percent. Ideally people would pay fees they thought were fair, instead of paying whatever the market says is "required".
And definitely using any kind of average of accepted fees is nonsense (this amplifies the effects of poor fee estimators). What matters is the *minimum* accepted fees for transactions of approx the same size, as well as the current state of the mempool. Of course it's not really possible to do this perfectly.

"instantly" was never a design goal of Bitcoin. It's explicitly aiming for 10 minute blocks. So is Bitcoin Cash, and so was segwit2x. Maybe this is a nit but you seem disingenuous when you describe it the way you did. That said it's not wrong to suggest that maybe instant transfers are better, and the options exist to explore that too. One has to acknowledge that the Bitcoin design makes a particular tradeoff to gain security in exchange for speed, while retaining decentralization.
Fees: it's certainly obvious that any user would prefer lower fees to higher fees. That is definitely a valid reason to not use (on-chain) Bitcoin transactions for everything. The thing is, if you look at the mempool during high-fee times, it's blindingly obvious that block size doubling would make almost no difference. 
IOTA is incredibly cool. I'll need to read the paper about 100 more times before I understand how it works and could compare it to blockchain-based currencies.
My main issue with guys like Ver is that they aren't acting in a trustworthy way. Of course he's free to support what he wants to support.

Frankly I don't understand why segwit2x is even still a thing. Big-blockers already have Bitcoin Cash so why not focus on that??? If they really want larger blocks + segwit (does anybody actually want that?) it would be far less contentious to add it to the existing Cash fork vs. creating a separate fork off segwit chain.

OP is coming at it from perspective of investing in Bitcoin to make money. Which is fine, but not what hodlers are necessarily trying to do.
Personally, I think there is significant value in "the ability to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain", and so I'd love to increase my BTC holdings even more (it's tougher now that the price is so high...I still get paid in USD). So, from that perspective, it's not really relevant how big a proportion of my net worth in USD is attributed to BTC. Same as if my house appreciates -- I'm not going to "rebalance" because at the end of the day... I want the house.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:25:27
So I mean, literally anybody can create their own coin and say that it starts from block X on the bitcoin chain (vs. premining their own genesis block). In fact I guess most bitcoiners prefer that since it means free coins for them (if they want them).
It doesn't really make sense to expect people who do that to follow any particular rules of Bitcoin, because the whole point is they're building something separate from Bitcoin.
So there's a bit of a difference between that kind of situation, and a situation where a rule change requires the chain becoming incompatible with old nodes. Though technically these are both "hard forks".
For the latter, one would expect a peer-reviewed BIP that goes through a lot of technical vetting &amp; revisions, followed by implementation, and then followed by nodes upgrading. I'm not an expert but I think "consensus" support for the change could then be evaluated in much the same way as it is for soft-forks.
2x is allowed to exist. And they even brought up their own nodes to support it (hopefully they have enough?). All the fighting is because it's been developed separately from Bitcoin but is trying to position itself (by colluding with "big" players such as miners and exchanges) as a "network upgrade" (not to mention the weirdness that is Metronome...). People who see what's actually happening react badly to all the lying.

Great post &amp; story! Don't sweat the 1 BTC; everyone who didn't put up their life savings a few years ago could say the same kind of thing about what could have been. And after all you're less than 0.5 BTC behind, which isn't so bad in exchange for pursuing an interest &amp; learning about the technology!
Mining w/out needing to pay for power is a sweet deal, of course. Hope it stays that way!
Finally, as a miner, do you have an opinion on 2x? It's obviously a controversial topic, and I don't mean to attack you about it here (so let's avoid debating it in the comments). I'd urge you to read up on it yourself and ensure that you're mining with a pool that lines up with what you think is right.

Assuming we're outside of a tax-advantaged account (e.g. if you were somehow doing this within a 401k then there is no tax on capital gains):
This would be handled the same as if you were selling stock X to buy stock Y. You'll owe tax on the gains from selling stock X (the amount will be based on your cost basis for X &amp; also if you've held it for at least a year to use the long-term rate). Using that money to buy bitcoin vs. stock Y doesn't make a difference for tax purposes.
Ideally you've got choices about what to sell so you can try and reduce / eliminate the tax hit (e.g. anything you can sell at a loss? otherwise prefer to sell things that qualify for long-term rate and/or smallest gains). Timing is also something to consider: if you do this now this will be part of 2019 taxes (so ensure you are prepared to pay); if you do it in January then it won't come up until doing 2020 taxes.

I think you're just misunderstanding what a "soft fork" is defined as. It is still a fork after all.
[ covers it pretty well. Your example is exactly fitting that definition: after the soft-fork, only a subset of the blocks accepted by the "old" rules are still considered valid (specifically, only the ones that respect the extra semantics for lock time).
In particular I suggest reading the "Security" section of that wiki ("In order for a softfork to work, a majority of the mining power needs to be running a client recognizing the fork."). I also think the part where it says "Softforks cannot be reversed without a hardfork" is a good way to understand the difference between these two.

Ideally one would use an entropy "extractor" that provides uniformly random bitstrings even if the dice are not perfect.
It does not require determining what the bias in the die actually is (which is good because we could only estimate that), though it does require more dice rolls &amp; also relies on assumptions that the bias is consistent over time and that individual dice rolls aren't correlated (these last two are a good reason to use physical dice in the first place).

The "price" doesn't mean anything more than what someone recently paid for Bitcoin. Of course you can make this number higher by paying money in. Unless you've got some kind of side bet on the price itself though, it's meaningless, and really has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself.

About ASICs, [ explains it far better than I could hope to.
How many hard forks has/will Monero undergo trying to defeat hardware specialization? I'd propose most bitcoiners strongly prefer to avoid such hard forks.
I think it's also worth noting that global CPU production is \*extremely\* centralized. At least with a simple PoW like Bitcoin's, there is no barrier to entry for hardware production related to the choice of algorithm.
Also regarding fiat...I'm baffled how you could even conceive of "price discovery" without dealing with fiat. "Bitcoin developers could of \[sic\] made an on-chain, built-in, exchange for price discovery"...I'm not clear on what you're talking about here, but 1000x "no" if you mean something on layer 1: Bitcoin protocol should be about the Bitcoin blockchain and that's \*it\*. If you mean something above that layer, then I'd say nothing is stopping that from the Bitcoin side (and isn't Bisq pretty much that?)

I think it's definitely this, assuming you aren't having connection issues with Bitcoin network. The initial chain sync is very disk-intensive. To the point that I think it could definitely be improved---it makes sense to hit disk for each block during normal operation, but during the initial sync it seems like severe overkill. Though I'm not sure how easy / hard it would be to fix this (it's related to the database library used by the client), the way it accesses disk is far from suitable for spinning media.
I've symlinked my "chainstate" directory onto SSD to avoid this problem. It's only a few GB (the bulk of the data lives on my HDD) so even if you don't have an SSD, you might be able to get away with pointing that to a USB stick temporarily (though I've never tried that).

I'm going to assume you're just mistaken (as opposed to trolling).
The term "replay protection" perhaps brings in some weird connotations. But what we're talking about is the ability to specify (in a cryptographically-secure way) which chain a transaction is meant for. There's no good reason not to have this, assuming you acknowledge that there will be two distinct chains and different people that support either side.
The way the current seg2x works does not offer a good way to achieve this. There are only workarounds, but people are (rightly IMHO) concerned that typical users won't understand what is happening when they send a transaction.

I don't think so...because a higher difficulty would be bad for them too.
Put another way, miners shouldn't directly care about "competition". What matters is their efficiency vs. current difficulty (and the "competition" indirectly affects them because more competition =&gt; higher difficulty).
If anything I'd say miners are incentivized to increase the timestamp difference to keep difficulty low. But it's not like they can just fudge it indefinitely (see [jcoinner's comment]( with links to more reference info about this).
It's an interesting question though. Timestamps are definitely not reliable (if you can come up with a decentralized way to have trustable timestamps...let someone know).

Attacking hashing with quantum computing is not that simple.
True, assuming a particularly ideal system you could "try all possibilities at once". But without a smarter algorithm that won't actually help you find which possibility led to a matching hash. You'll just have that hash result superposed with all the non-matching ones in your qubits.
You could go read up on Shor's algorithm for factoring numbers to try to understand why that one is not as simple as just "try all possible factors at once". Or Grover's algorithm which is (AFAIK) the best-known quantum approach to a problem like attacking SHA-256 (and it only provides a quadratic speedup, i.e. 256 -&gt; 128, which isn't so dire considering that Bitcoin already reduces strength from 256 -&gt; 160).

\&gt; allowing the pool to, in essence, refuse to mine transactions with a fee below a certain amount attached
This has always been the miner's prerogative, and they can do that directly instead of via introducing some weird non-propagated transactions.  
Definitely it would be an issue if a pool operator does this \*without\* telling the pool members. But miners in a pool should be able to notice the impact on their income pretty easily and choose a better pool.  
I'm struggling to believe that miners would mine for a pool that doesn't fairly distribute the reward. What's the incentive for them to mine at a discount?

I agree it's a mix of those two for the most part (one extremely rare corner case where you might rationally pay more than expected sats/byte is if you have a UTXO that is pretty close to the full amount you want to pay, such that paying to one output &amp; letting the fees be the whole change ends up cheaper than adding a change output to the txn, even if sats/byte is higher the # of bytes with one output is lower).

The network makes no distinction between "mining" or "non mining" nodes. A node is a node. Mining is mining. They're really separate concepts, and the network is a network of nodes (the fact that the original software implemented both functions notwithstanding). Bitcoin needs both to work.
Can you clarify what you mean by "economic node"? I'm not sure what a non-economic node would be, but I would probably not consider it a node at all.
My take on why individual nodes are important: I run a node so that I can interact with the blockchain without trusting a third-party. Trustless economy is part of the whole reason to have the blockchain in the first place. Therefore, if we are trying to encourage more people to participate in this (I think everyone agrees that is a good thing), we should encourage them to do so trustlessly, which is why one ascribes value to keeping the cost of running a node low.  
In your scenario of a node pretending to be 1000's of nodes via different IP addresses, you might be oversimplifying how a UASF would work. If your node started to interfere with the relaying of blocks that others thought were valid, they'd eventually stop connecting to your node (or, you would soon become unable to broadcast any blocks that other nodes cared about).
To answer "why did the non mining full nodes matter in which chain the miners ultimately followed?": I'd say because the miners believed what those nodes were signalling was reflective of the majority opinion of participants in the bitcoin economy. Though maybe you should clarify what you're talking about, because I'm thinking of the P2SH UASF, but I suspect (based on context) you're talking about segwit. The way segwit was "resolved" was a lot more complicated than a UASF.

You're ignoring that empty blocks still involve the same POW as any other block. In particular, such a block does have value in providing extra confirmation for \*every existing transaction\*. In the current regime the system is inherently biased towards those confirmations by virtue of the built-in per-block mining reward.
Also you seem to think that this kind of empty block has a negative impact on how long it takes for new tx to get included in a block. That is \*not\* true: the expected time for a new tx to get included in a block is always 10 minutes, until it gets included (it is a memoryless probability at work here). What \*would\* have a negative impact is if significant hashrate was deliberately always avoiding including transactions in blocks---but the system is already designed to penalize that behavior since a miner doing that is giving up mining fees. Miners in that pool would leave if they see their expected reward is better elsewhere.
Adding rules like this "delay" based on the blocks is a dangerous idea IMHO. All it does is pervert the fundamental design based on the mathematics of POW, difficulty, and mining fees / rewards. You are of course free to do that on your node.

IMHO one important aspect (haven't seen it in the comments so far) is that this enables significant backwards-compatible scaling if you want to use more complicated schemes than one public key.

\&gt;  we as users cannot do anything
Actually, if users set fees according to what they think is fair (vs. what estimators tell them is the "best" fee; this leads to a positive feedback loop), they can combat this.
A miner spamming such high-fee transactions will eventually bleed out. Either because they're giving up revenue from real fees to just pay their own money back to themselves in the blocks they mine, or because they're risking other miners snapping up those juicy fees out from under them.
\*Meanwhile\* all the existing transactions benefit a bit because those juicy fees will attract more miners to secure the network.
You are correct that "normal" users are probably susceptible to this kind of manipulation. IMHO the only real weapon is education; that is just the nature of a "your keys = your coins" system.

My personal opinion on this:
I'd be ok if the approach was, as soon as the "theft" was detected and a malicious transaction was \*broadcast\*, CX went out and told miners "don't mine that transaction, mine this one instead (moving the funds to a secure address)". It's part of the system that miners get to choose what to (try to) mine. Maybe they'd listen to him, maybe not. It would be controversial maybe (especially if it turned out that it just takes a call to Jihan to get this to happen) but ultimately could be classified as "growing pains" (we already know that mining could be more decentralized esp. when it comes to decision-making).
But as soon as this transaction is included in a block, and especially after it is several blocks deep, it's basically an attack to try to reverse it. Doing so means more than just canceling the one transaction. It means \*rewriting the history of all of those blocks\*. The majority of people don't use Binance so why should the security of everybody's transactions be affected by their screw-up? The whole point of the blockchain is the idea that blocks eventually become immutable as more blocks are mined on top of them. It \*is true\* that this depends on miners to act rationally: if they act to break this property, then the utility of the chain is put at risk so they're basically killing their own assets.  
In practice this would actually just result in a potentially very long &amp; ping-ponging chain-split. Not to mention also slowing down mining of new transactions (very noticeably; they were talking about "quorum" being \~80% hash power so blocktimes would go up 5x). It would probably be uglier than the whole BCH debacle was.  
I think the main objection would be that this is philosophically counter to the design principles of the Bitcoin blockchain, even \*if\* it is technically possible given some assumptions about what miners would agree to collude on. It's not something you do just because you feel like it (the fact that it had to be discussed rather than an existing procedure enacted is proof enough that this lies outside the realm of what the chain is designed for). I think you certainly could design cryptocurrencies that support something like this, but it would be something different from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:04:28
I'm immediately suspicious of why someone is promoting the idea for everyone to do this on a particular day.
Definitely I agree with "not your keys = not your coins". So I would advocate for everybody to \*always\* keep the majority of their cryptocurrency in a cold storage wallet of their own. And if you've got a large trading balance, not a bad idea to spread it across a couple of reputable exchanges to hedge against insolvency risk.
If you're not already set up that way, then fix it now. Don't wait for a day when it will be most likely that things will go wrong, if systems designed for typical volumes fall over when there is a spike in volume.
As far as "proof" goes I also think it's not a bad idea to periodically cycle which of your coins are on which exchanges. It can be done at the same time as rebalancing. Though if you're working with an exchange that you have such trust issues with, then consider just abandoning that exchange altogether.

2) "Proponent" is too strong IMHO. He's talked about blockchain in terms of "we need to regulate it" (not sure what he's said if anything about Bitcoin specifically). Which is arguably better than saying "it'll never take off" but it doesn't mean his beliefs about how money should work align at all with the philosophies behind cryptocurrency. In fact I'd worry that he'd want to make yet another fiat currency.
3) I think the current standard should be to assume all such politicians are in the pocket of lobbyists (in this case, Wall Street) unless they prove otherwise. So don't put any stock into words he has said in the past.

The way you said it isn't quite right but I think you have the right idea. I'll try to explain (but I may get too technical, also I won't be talking about the more modern stuff like segwit etc.)
A bitcoin private key is literally just a random number. There are slightly less than 2^(256) possible values for this (the "slightly less" is very insignificant so you can pretend it is exact). If you know this value then you essentially control the coins associated with it, and the security is entirely based on that 1 out of 2^(256) is such a tiny fraction.
A bitcoin public key is derived from the private key with a well-known procedure. But it is one-way---given the private key it is trivial to compute the public key. But given the public key you essentially have to guess to find the private key. That said, it's still the case that each private key corresponds to a unique public key and vice-versa. The important thing about these is: given a public key 'q', someone who knows the corresponding private key 'p' can \*prove\* that they know it, without actually revealing 'p' itself (basically they'll be able to produce yet a different number with certain properties in relation to 'q', that would be very hard to find without knowing 'p'). If you want to know more about these keys look up elliptic curve cryptography and "secp256k1" for bitcoin specifically.
Note: the one-wayness could change in the future if someone builds a large enough quantum computer. So keep reading.
A bitcoin "address" is technically the thing that has value, in that the blockchain basically says "this address is worth X". There are 2^(160) possible addresses, but only a small fraction of those have ever actually been mentioned in the blockchain.
The "address" is derived from the public key; actually the address is based off a little program called a "script". The basic script goes something like "if someone can prove they know the private key for public key 'q', then they control this address". Fancier scripts are also possible (you may have heard of multi-signature etc.).
In fact the address is a "hash" of the script itself (the script can be long, but the hash will always be 160 bits, hence the 2^(160) possible addresses). This means two things:
1) Even though each address is created from a certain script, theoretically there are infinitely many scripts that hash to the same value (in practice Bitcoin puts a limit on the length of the script though, and \*most\* Bitcoin users would also be limited to "standard" script structures). Technically all you need to be able to spend an address is to be able to produce \*any\* script that hashes to it and that you can satisfy the conditions of.
2) The address does not reveal anything about the public key; you need to see the unhashed script for that. This is important because the hashing (actually in bitcoin it's a double hashing) is, as far as we know, quantum resistant, unlike the public / private key derivation.
You may have noticed the numbers here are a bit interesting. 2^(160) is huge but it is quite a bit smaller than 2^(256). It ultimately means that for any given address, one expects there are actually around 2^(96) different private keys that could be used to spend it (note also, because of point 1, whether the address was originally created as multisig or some other fancy structure does not materially change this fact).
tl;dr what you got slightly wrong was "**ALL** bitcoin addresses already exist in the blockchain". That's not true, the blockchain represents a very tiny fraction of all possible addresses and actually this is critical, because we rely on there being basically 0 chance of two different people coming up with the same address. But, the idea you got right was that there's a fixed set of private keys and corresponding public keys (for each, almost all the numbers from 0 to 2^(256)), and the system is just waiting for people to pick a particular pair and use them, and each person just has to keep secret which ones they picked. There are just \*so many\* that we're not worried about running out.

Part of that is true whether the block is empty or not. And a miner that successfully mines an alternative block before they hear about the empty block could still publish it; this requires some coincidence but not exactly uncommon. And yes the winning miner has a bit of a head start, which has nothing to do with whether the block they mined was empty or not.  
I don't see how it is selfish given that it is actually less profitable to mine that way on purpose. And I don't think there's any evidence that it is being done on purpose...those blocks are probably empty because a block was mined just before and the pool hasn't figured out which transactions are valid to mine next.

Well now I've said more. So here's a key point (and to be clear, it is my very subjective opinion here, hopefully you don't think it is demonstrably dumb but if so, so be it): if you care about fees you should already be setting the fees according to what you think is appropriate, and not what others happen to be doing. The fee market in bitcoin could only work efficiently (in the sense of price-finding) if it is done that way. Basing your fees on recent blocks is pretty much asking for miners to try to manipulate you, while the point of the fees is to let the users dictate terms.
