I believe that Bitcoin isn't a bubble. I feel like it would have popped by now if it were. Those are just my two cents. But who am I but just a single user on reddit?

Agreed! Paxful blows the competition out of the water!!

paxful is the best among those

That's so true. It's nice to know that at least some of the money is going somewhere it could really help people.

Probably going to permanently switch to Paxful now. I like what they're doing over there with their recent projects in Africa.

I believe that Paxful may be a great option for you in regards to your stipulations. Only e-mail verification is required.

In my opinion, the best exchange out there is Paxful.com! Their customer service is the best and I get to trade my gift cards sooo.. yea.

I believe that Paxful is safe and the people that run it seem like good people.

They've also got great 24/7 customer support.

This is too true. I still think Paxful is the best though.

Haven't tried a lot of other platforms but I use Paxful! Been on there for a while and it's been serving me well! I like the options and I like the service so far.
