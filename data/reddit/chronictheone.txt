Correct me if I'm wrong but can't you use the same wallet for either BCH and BTC? BCH is the last coin I will ever own though, they are to negative and feed on BTC bad news rather than looking at themselves.

Please keep doing it, we need to feed on something.

Never buy a hardware wallet if not directly from the supplier. You will find it cheaper on Amazon, eBay, etc and then you can expect this to happen.

Nobody points out that there were no bitcoins in the 80s?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:07:36
Great timing for you to say 'Yeah I lost everything!' and shut your mouth about your portfolio. You don't want people to know you are rich - if you ever get there.

Has to do with Segwit adoption (raising).
Edit: Maybe not.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:41:35
I believe he means the value can increase infinitely.

FUD, they just announce yesterday that this is not the case.

Thank you.

I thought one of the good things about segwit was how there was actually a choice.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:18:55
Much more expensive and worse economy. I don't think there is a single for argument to get an SUV.

You can even buy 0.00000001 BTC, of course you don't need to buy the 1000.

If this happened I would in all honesty hold what I have and buy even more. I sincerely wish this ever happens.

Probably reaction to LN.

If it's the direct same equivalent, no. Cx-5 = Mazda 3

What is Andreas point of view on the current state of the fee/difficulty to make payments with Bitcoin? Is he for segwit? Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:45:43
They said hatchback equivalent.

I don't think it comes with experience. It fits a certain personality type.

Only in exchanges which have a premium on top of the price. Gdax for instance is always inflationed. Go to coinmarketcap for the true value.

I opened bitcoin.com yesterday and it never ever mentioned bitcoin cash, only bitcoin. Then I opened his academy thing and it shows a cringey animoji of Ver going "HI I AM ROGER VER THE CEO OF BITCOIN.COM". Truly narcissistic.

What if you have hardware wallets? Having a "buffer" wallet wouldn't help I guess.

The cx3 is also an SUV. I'm talking Mazda 2 Vs cx3, Mazda 3 Vs cx5 etc.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:38:04
I bought loads of altcoins a couple of Sundays ago, and they had to be bought with BTC so I had to buy the same amount of BTC in USD. BTC was at 11.5k. I thought I was going to be clever so I put my order at 11k. Price went as low as 11.3k but never as low as 11k. That was the moment I realised, in order to 'not lose' some money I could be losing everything. I bought at market price instantly (11.8k). Look at the price today.

@_date: 2017-12-05 18:43:27
Honest question: why are these exchanges not adopting segwit? What are the cons in adopting it?

4WD no advantage in urban environments unless you like to spend petrol. The Mazda 3 and CX-5 are equally spacious. Both have the same amount of seats. Both have the same boot size. No reason to buy the CX-5 over the Mazda 3.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:06
Don't. Once it rebounds it's profit. Now it's on sale, get your discount. Just like the price went down now because of the difficulty adjustment, on the 31st the difficulty will change again and bitcoin will get to stable 20k+

I consider the overall average a good indicator of its true value of there is one. I personally use cryptocompare for it actually.

You're wrong. USA flips day with month. Not the year. So it's still 11118 internationally. Unless it's 112018.

Whales are people with lots of money, usually institutions, banks, funds or something big enough to be able to disrupt the market with a single movement, in basic terms.
Roger is someone who defends the 1st of august fork, so it's against bitcoin's philosophy and pro coin which derived from said fork.

Will you be saying the same at 18k?

Oh shit so is that what BTC stands for? I found an old envelope this morning saying '50000BTC' in a yard sale but thought it stood for Business Travel Coalition and tossed it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:32:21
Too bad they sent it at midnight when I was sleeping and cut it down at 6AM, so now I have 2k GDP parked at Kraken (withdrawal fees are £60). Didn't even give a days notice.
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:18:53
Done it, they ignored my questions and said it's very easy to withdraw for a fee of £60 with detailed instructions as if they were a robot replying. No care at all.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:14:46
Excellent this is exactly what I was looking for, thank you.
How can you create a random address offline though? Even if almost impossible, doesn't that mean it's possible to randomly create the same address twice on two offline computers?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:52:37
Man not even 24h. They literally stole £60 from me because that's the fee for withdrawing GBPs. If they gave us 24hs at least I could buy bitcoins and sell for USD or EUR.
It's not a good principle and makes me wonder what else will they do with 6hours notice. I always trusted kraken until today. Not so much now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:05:41
Tethers probably.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:06:19
Why does he take offense for Bitcoin Cash to be called BCash but has no problem to call Bitcoin Bitcoin Core?
Also called Bitcoin the "Original Bitcoin" around the 12 minute mark,  which was ironic.
Carvalho was clearly baiting him but Very was clearly defensive from start and very misinformed. Bad bad PR move here.
Edit: Forgot to mention how he calls Bitcoin Cash "his project" at least twice and in his video apology. Seriously? "Decentralised" my ass.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:33:57
Funny thing is he doesn't even say 9000 in the original version. The power of a meme.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:27:28
Was speaking with a colleague today and she said real estate is what she believes in the most, because there will always be value and demand for it, and its supply is somehow limited. After I explained Bitcoin's supply limited numbers she said she was in.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:23:34
Even after reading all the comments in this thread I still cannot understand the correlation between BTC and Thethers. I agree with all you were saying until the 'tries to take out their bitcoins and there aren't enough bitcoins'. I understand if there are no tethers to take out, if it's fake, but why bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:42:07
Thank you for your response. So it would need to be both Tether not having a reserve in USD and bitfinex lying about their bitcoin holdings? Is bitfinex that big to influence the market and cause a crash? I keep hearing about all the red flags around tethers past couple of weeks but the price keeps going up in every coin, would the market not be alarmed? I'm seriously considering selling every crypto for fiat for the time being...
Edit: this graph is some serious scary shit 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:57:24
What I fear is, it's quite obvious at this point that Tethers are not backed up by real money, and it's likely the whole market will suffer with it. I have all coins safe in paper wallets but its value will go down alongside everyone else's.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:01:27
I agree real estate is a great investment for its Intrinsic value. But they are two very different things. It's true you cannot live on bitcoin but a bitcoin doesn't pay tax, or need maintenance, or need to be fixed in a specific plot of land, etc. Not saying either is better, just saying they are different. Your stick figures lack the subjective value market gives RE or BTC, that is a poor argument. What I meant by being finite was how something which the market is seeing value on actually has a limit, hence the sense of early adoption even at 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:07:23
If this is true, don't forget you also have $50k+ in forkcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:49:50
Meaning I can add multiple inputs associated with different coins or would I only be able to add one kind of coin for each wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:47:33
Serious question, what are the main differences in the core values between and I always wanted to ask but never got the opportunity. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:02:46
I don't care if 20k vanish if that meant I could potentially make 2mil.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:11:13
What makes you say that about B2X? Figures show adoption is almost certain by now. I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:08:12
Because of the previous fork leading to an increase from $1000 to $4000 perhaps.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:02:36

With bcash it was basically free and BTC value tripled.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:12:19
What happens if you have BTC in paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:16:33
After BCH raised 50% in less than a week?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:47:13
One is safer and lower return. The other is riskier with higher return. Depending on your risk aversion (the older or younger you are), you should allocate more or less to one or the other. But I would recommend having both. Diversifying is good.
