Impossible to say. What I do know is that there’s a massive inflow of new bitcoin owners who don’t understand why their transaction is not coming through and may think that they’ve lost their investment forever. That sucks big time imo.

This guy is our blockchain and bitcoin messias. Probably a little bit too early but he really deserves a Nobel prize.

From $10k to $20k increase in value is 100%
From 20 to 30 is 50%
From 30 to 40 is 33%
From 40 to 50 is 25%
From 50 to 60 is 20% increase.
And so on.
We will get there faster than you think.

100 normal years is an equivalent of 10.000 years in the crypto space. Moore’s law. By then, blockchain technology will be replaced by something else (if humans still exist). So the answer to your question is: zero.

I have a very expensive taste which means that My Moon is hovering around $100.000 per Bitcoin.

You’re welcome bro :-)

That is already happening with trading bots, paid shillers/fudders etc. All part of the game��

That would be around 0.0013 BTC. I think you can’t even buy that small amount on an exchange...

That guy is so 2015
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:54:02
You are joking, right?

10k will be somewhat of a starting point. New money is flowing in by the minute. We ain’t seen nothing yet!
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:47:22
Yeah well but they are working on it, right? Rome wasn’t built in a day.

Well, I know the stories of people who sell their house and everything for bitcoin. And I can understand that. But to actually go full in debt for something as risky as bitcoin is just plain stupid. Never invest with money that you cannot miss.

You are witnessing a revolution. It as simple as that. The fact that everything keeps rising is because crypto is being valued as a new asset class. And because of it’s promising future it will continue to keep rising until someone or something hits the red button. That moment is not there yet imo.

Lol. I am glad that I don't have to kill you because you are so way out of line with your thinking. But thanks though for your brilliant insights :-)
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:41:23
I can't tell you what the exact, much broader idea is because then I would have to kill you. Of course it will not be another exchange. I am only looking for a simple and safe way for someone to exchange fiat into Bitcoin. Pretty sure that someone has already written the software and/or has experience with this.

It is FUCKING insane that there’s still no movie made about Bitcoin. We are talking about world changing technology here.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:29:53
Probably yes. Still too much uncertainty imo

When quantum computers arrive we are fucked. The world will change drastically. A normal computer opens 10 different boxes one by one to find the hidden ball. A quantum computer will open the boxes all at once.

You are right. It’s called the Grover’s algorithm:

Most people I tell about Bitcoin until today have heard of it but don’t understand what it is. I can’t blame them, although I keep trying to explain why Bitcoin/crypto/blockchain is so special and how/why it’s going to change our lives. 90% of the people I tell about it (including my boss, tipped him the first time when the price was around $600) still did not buy 1 single Bitcoin. I surely believe that the price of Bitcoin will keep on rising. There may be fierce corrections like we’ve seen many times before but this thing is unstoppable. Look at Asia where there’s already a huge cashless society in some countries. Look at Dubai now. Look at Russia. All banks. All big online stores &amp; tech companies. Blockchain has arrived and with Bitcoin on the forefront it can only go up.
