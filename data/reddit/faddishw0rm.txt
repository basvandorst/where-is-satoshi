@_date: 2014-10-15 14:28:44
Thanks so much for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:29:40
Anything specific? 
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:39:55
The reason its dead end login pages is because you have to login first ha ha :P
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:03:29
Ha ha, well thats my frustration when everything I post on gets downvoted. 
By shit, I mean uninterested. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:04:22
there we go, fixed :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:06:36
Oh I see, This is what dogecoin users were saying. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:43:06
I always get downvoted and ignored when I put it here, so I wasn't sure.
I don't have the same problem in the dogecoin community though, there are over 400 users, they really got behind it and ive had great feedback. 
Is there a different subreddit to use like or something?? This one seems mostly about market speculation.
My service is  by the way. No idea why no one is interested here, I would be happy if someone explained it.

These are good points. Thanks for taking the time to reply :)
The funds are held in escrow. Basically the worker doesn't get paid until the  employer verifies the funds. The funds must be deposited before the job can be placed, so you know that the employer is good for it before you start working.
I also check the jobs to see if they aren't malicious porn sites, download a virus or other sketchy jobs, so there is some degree of safety.
I think 10% is reasonable for an audited system with built in escrow and dispute management services. Freelancer.com.au charge you $5 just to accept a job as a worker. And microworkers.com charge 7.5% and also a 0.75c flat fee for placing any job. I removed the flat fee and upped the percentage to make it less confusing. With hosting costs its not like im really making copious amounts of money and its actually at a big loss at the moment.
There are no bitcoin offers because there are no bitcoin employers, because no one from bitcoin seems too interested. 
Thanks again for your feedback, its quite useful :)

Awesome, I did something similar but never spotted a Bitcoin ATM ha ha
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:01:08
Don't jump over to bitcoin and start scamming. Your a terrible person, its one thing to do it. But you have been caught and now blatantly lie about it. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:50:12
This was my original design, but I changed it so that people could get an idea what a site does without having to login first. 
I like your idea though. Think its due for a design overhaul

Please Don't give anything to +mint-coin or johngmail2 he is a scammer with multi accounts - thanks.
Be careful
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:51:58
Interesting that this got -1'd without an explanation. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 05:11:52
Ha ha, thanks for the tip.
I am not vovoros. I run a few big projects over at namely work4crypto and doge4uniforms.
This guy hates me because I keep calling out his scams so he downvotes all my posts. Kinda frustrating doing a fundraiser for people and it gets downvotes :( 
Figured if I keep warning people he will giveup and go away. lol
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:19:39
We have a projects section to appeal to richer shibes. Funds are held in Escrow, a bit more like freelancer.com
I see your point though. At the moment, dogecoin is getting jobs in there and new users and snapping them up. They can get about 3000 dogecoins in 15-20 minutes and thats enough to tip on twitch, reddit or whatever. :)
Thanks for the feedback though, I get your point. Would you even consider employing someone to do small jobs?
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:39:36
Thats awesome!
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:43:37
its interesting how this got a downvote in but lots of positivity from haha
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:54:59
Hey, I have already applied your feedback, the home page is now the job page :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:18:43
Have you heard of Travel By Bit? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:13:26
sure, thats obvious but at some point if ur manipulating or calculating a value for whatever reason u'll need to store it somewhere.
Like I said, not a huge deal.

Lots of haters on this thread, I get that this is but I just wanted to mention a few reasons why a business/service might choose to use dogecoin. I am sure I will be downvoted into oblivion but here goes nothing:
1. Wild currency swings - while all crypto has ups and downs we have seen BTC swing by the highest fiat dollar amounts. This means that if voidspace store in BTC and a silk road clone goes down or whatever, all of a sudden their stored takings are half the value. I get that doge gets hit by this too, but I think BTC is the tip of the spear for all price action - so BTC feels highs and lows the most.
2. Community - NASCAR, Bobsled Team, and other projects demonstrate a strong ability to get behind good businesses or ideas. Businesses want to tap into that community and generally if its half good doge users will get behind it. I've never seen a business saying "we accept doge" on get downvotes, but I have seen this on - voidspace no doubt wants to tap into this enthusiastic user base that will do anything to promote dogecoin and associated services. 
3. Denomination - Not a huge deal but 0.0000001 of a BTC is harder to deal with then 10000 dogecoin, its just a matter of the decimal point. From a programming perspective, I even have to use primitive types like floats and doubles just to store the BTC values, not a huge thing but denominations in the 000's is better than the alternative.
**A rising tide lifts all boats**, we should be pushing for crypto adoption, not having a pissing war over what currency is the best. There is no sense wasting energy fighting over a market when user adoption is the key to both BTC and DOGE success. Personally I hold both coins but I see doge as having carved a very strong place for itself in the crypto world.

Hey, I am super excited about voidspace and I honestly can't wait.
I also run work4crypto.com, regarding the comments here I wan't to give you some advice, I have had a few crypto operations since this time last year.
**Dogecoin is fun**
Community is a massive part of it, so when you post "We accept dogecoin" on or tweet it your guaranteed to get some users to support you. I think when people say "dogecoin is fun" they mean its more like the community is accepting and helpful, people new to crypto currency would definitely have an easier time with dogecoin IMO.
**BTC and LTC tend to hoard**
This isn't to troll, I have hard data on this from, work4crypto. 95% of the user base is dogecoin, precisely because I went on and they got behind me.
Similarly I posted on and had people like +troll me, downvote me and generally tell me to GTFO. I found the BTC community very harsh and I found the LTC community non-existent. This isn't me taking a shot at bitcoin, I think adoption of crypto is paramount for all crypto currencies but its me taking a shot at the community behind BTC and some of the attitudes towards dogecoin and various sites/services. 
I commend your decision to get behind dogecoin, the people on will get behind you 100% and make launching for you a lot easier.
If you have any questions ping me..
