Got bit my first trade today, but was lucky enough to catch the long at \~9400
Didn't see the crazy swing coming though, that was interesting to watch.

I honestly have no idea what to do about it...
I don't have much, so not like I'm playing with thousands of dollars here.
I'm just thinking of letting go of the initial investment of a buy order I placed last time it was $13K . I've been waiting for an opportunity to break even on that one, so I think I'll take my chance on that.
The rest I have was bought well under $10K, and I certainly don't need it so it will stay in the wallet.
Also thinking of dumping my LTC as well, that's been stuck at the $130s. Might pocket half, then take the rest of the profit and exchange it for BTC.
Actually now that I write it out, that's exactly what I'm going to do! Thanks for the post, I've got a plan now!

It's supposedly surrounding a claim that Tether is printing their tokens out of thin air. They say every token is backed by a dollar, but some people have speculated that it isn't. And people use these essentially nonexistent tokens to artificially pump BTC.
Can't speak much for it, I don't know any better.
But I'm certainly not going to listen to people that tell me to sell all of my BTC for BCash, because BCash is the real bitcoin and BTC is just an impostor.
Sure, let me trade all my 200% returns for something that hasn't been 25% of its ATH for a whole calendar year. That's sound financial advice /s
