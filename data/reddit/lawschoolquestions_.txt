Do any other organizations offer an iOS app and a (fairly) easy to use interface? 
If we want bitcoin to be mainstream (which, let's face it, is the "goal". Widespread adoption means mainstream) then it needs to be *accessible*. This means an app, and it means an all-in-one solution (or close to it). 
I am an outsider here, but that's the perspective that's needed. People use Coinbase because it's a familiar system with an unfamiliar currency. Crypto currencies are confusing. There are millions of people invested in crypto who don't understand it at all.

That’s the ticket. Ease of use. I’m not a designer so I wouldn’t know what they’re doing right specifically, but it seemed very familiar even the first time I used it. 
I think *maybe* it’s sort of like the old Mac/PC debate. A lot of PC users couldn’t wrap their heads around the fact that people’s priorities may be different - and that it wasn’t as much about possibilities as it was about ease of use. Windows was a much more open OS, but that didn’t matter to everybody. 
I read this once (many years ago, obviously) and while it’s obvious hyperbole, I think it illustrated some of the issues: Windows was created by dumb people for smart people to use, and OSX was created by smart people for dumb people to use. A lot of people just want something that’s easy to use and Venmo is a great example of that.

Jesus christ. Bitcoin fanboys have got to be one of the worst parts about the technology.
