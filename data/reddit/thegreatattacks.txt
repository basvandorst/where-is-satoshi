I don't see why they can't
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:27:34
I'm pretty sure Cryptopia has closed their services to new comers
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:29:46
You can set custom fees, there are no extra fees for using different wallets
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:34:40
No sorry :(
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:28:56
It might be a pre-BIP seed

Hardware Wallets: Ledger / Trezor (don't use keepkey)
PC Wallets: Electrum or Bitcoin Core (not Exodus)

There "don't upvote" memes are really effective
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:30:39
I lol'd
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:24:42
I really hope this is a reality soon :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:41:48
I support this wholeheartedly, I love Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:51
Not sure if this was sincere or a ploy to give your referral link to others.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:51:42
we have very similar usernames :O
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:57:43
Are you willing and able to lose 10k? I lost quite a bit from trading Ethereum before.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:08:21
Nothing you can do but pay the ransom, but that's pretty fucking cruel
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:27
I didn't earn much by mining anyway... right... *sobs*
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:24:20
I can try to help, can you tell me if you have a wallet already?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:00:50
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:39:37
No... no way... I refuse to believe this...
Vids or it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:52
I sold off last ATH at 0.3
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:14:10
This is very old but of course I would. Paper wallet segwit addresses are cool!
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:30:50
No you didn't. If you have the private key to your old address you are fine.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:33
0.3 BTC 
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:54:30
I'm guessing this is BTC-XMR?

Nothing but respect for the 99Bitcoin's owner.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:08:22
we have a shortage? sauce?
@_date: 2018-10-25 07:14:26
You need to take into account the volume
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:57:09
Check different variations of the words. The text you wrote down on the paper may be a completely different word because of your hand writing.
Worst case scenario, use normal recovery and see if that helps. If that doesn't work, then change to another seed.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:21:53
Also the halvening might bring the price to double? Not sure.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:14:35
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:46:26
Maybe referring to ledger hardware wallet? Then maybe if you revealed which is stupid 
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:22:04
I have never heard of Bitcoin Green before, I'm going to try and research it now.
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:03:50
Voorhees has been one of the first people to support Segwit (Shapeshift). Although him supporting 2x was scandalous, his interests were in his business (Shapeshift) and not to be mistaken with intent of harm :)
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:02:35
This. I don't understand why people post on Reddit what they should do. They should be going straight to a lawyer and making sure they have all the necessary proofs.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:24:01
Same coin, different protocols. Think of it like transferring USD to another service (e.g from PayPal to Skrill)
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:04:38
This is a pretty cool business model and a kick to the old days!
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:04:19
The term Web 3.0 hasn't even been coined to the knowledge of the general population. We are still early adopters here.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:07:22
Only invest what you are willing and able to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:13:16
bruh just use electrum
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:14:41
Fair enough.

From who? If he mined 1,000,000 BTC he gets to keep it. :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:27:56
thank you for this :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:38:28
If I buy 55€ today, and BTC price moons. Does the price increase?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:31:41
forgot /s
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:09:10
Hey it's me your brother.
I think it will be great to teach them about Bitcoin and how it works :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:58:55
no such thing as remining lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:49:45
this is too far mate
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:55:58
is the other side of in terms of politics. Full of Roger Ver's propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:49:51
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:55:28
Which then leads to my first reply.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:20:45
Mark this day on your calendar boys, we celebrate next year
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:00:20
Definitely do 0.01 BTC, it's only 10 USD
better to be in a bit than not be in at all
EDIT lol typo I meant 100 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:24:05
I have had this issue too. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:45:39
If he truly believes what he is creating, he doesn't need to

Are there set prices?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:43:01
Let's keep this meme revolution going. My baby is growing. But why did you take a picture of the meme instead of screenshotting it? PM me if you want the source file.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:42:27
Don't listen to all the haters of Coinbase. Just buy from them and transfer out asap and you should be good.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:26:35
We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:45:57
exactly. Once something is in the Blockchain it's done for good. You can't blot it out. The government can't just eradicate Bitcoin. As for legal issues I think people running nodes will continue
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:18:18
If you have the address saved you can search it up on a Block explorer.

@_date: 2017-09-04 02:02:41
NO! I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:48:06
To be honest we should all be happy we're over 4,000
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:09:45
Use Electrum for your computer and get familiar with how bitcoin works. A paper wallet is a wallet generated offline and stored on paper. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:19:16
If you want a private wallet, use Monero. But I think you are referring to private key and it's a key to unlock your wallet
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:54:32
Depends who you're with. If Starbucks opened one they might close it after a day
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:54:01
Thus increasing the value. Soon everyone will realise there are only that many Bitcoins for everyone and intense FOMO will commence
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:37:23
The image is supposed to be money :(
bitcoin is money
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:01:28
If Bitcoin is going to 500,000 in the long run - it doesn't matter 
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:36:44
1 sat should go through
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:52:34
I think bulletproofs are coming out soon. May be a good watch.
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:18:22
This is great! But old news lol
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:53:09
Litecoin did it. We are next

Welcome to the world of alt-coins
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:25:13
Who will be developing Segwit 2x
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:36:44
Trezor requires you to flash the firmware yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:48:45
I suggest you use LocalBitcoins as sometimes people are more reputable than exchanges :P
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:53:45
That's why merchants use services that immediately turn into fiat value after a transaction so the price doesn't depreciate
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:43:14
Is that official? I've always thought the .IO site was the original
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:31:27
I specialize in forensics and I may be able to help. Please PM me for more information.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:23:40
That is great 
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:48:42
Who is they?
Most people 'fighting' us are double crossing
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:29:37
Be careful this is a phishing link
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:38:17
Just use Coinbase and transfer out as soon as you learn about Bitcoin. Don't worry about the reviews 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:27:30
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:19:30
Try to learn Electrum 
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:45:13
I wouldn't really be shitting on China. China has done good things for Bitcoin, but also bad things
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:03:11
This is a hotbed for people to know how much you have
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:21:08
I am a computer forensics analyst and I can help you.
To be frank you haven't specified anything useful. Other than a non-genuine Windows XP, you haven't stated if you wiped the drive or not.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:13:40
Bitcoin Gold 
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:24:39
is correct. Gold has large use in electronics
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:52:17
Fair enough. I think there will either be a revolt or everyone will just cash out asap
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:06:09
They should cook with their bank notes :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:51:07
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:41:49
The whole point of Blockchain is that it's immutable. Oh and  means you don't need internet for Bitcoin.

I'm not sure if this is a meme or what
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:11:19
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:53:25
What website is this
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:15:43
I was stupid indeed. :(
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:42:22
So we still have the block size debate... So 3rd bitcoin essentially :D
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:45:04
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:41:51
Yeah I see. Never thought everything would be all singing kumbaya
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:49:15
How much did you lose?
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:47:35
Okay... This is what you can do. You can do a parent pays for child. If you want more help don't hesitate to contact me. You can also a do a replace by fee :)
EDIT: You can do it in Electrum, or you can solo mine it using a set up. I've done it a few times for my stuck transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:53:56
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:07:52
So is it showing confirmed on Blockchain.info? If it is you may have to sync your wallet.
If you have trouble syncing,  delete everything in %appdata%\bitcoin except for wallet.dat
Or you can use Electrum's light client for a quick overview if that's your style :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:57:18
Could I have the TX? You can also 'accelerate it' on ViaBTC's acceleration service.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:15:15
Electrum is probably the best wallet out there right now. You're in good hands :D
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:42:23
How do you do that?
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:06:17
What's the TX?
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:57:40
You never know what happens. There might be a *secret weapon* for all you know. Only time will tell..
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:35:38
Poke it down or up?
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:31:52
Speak English
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:36:06
I don't. Should I stake 2 BTC to have a chance of getting ~15 ish BTC back? Or should I just leave it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:25:07
....Fuck ...
