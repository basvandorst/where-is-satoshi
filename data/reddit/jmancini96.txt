Any connection to the founders? I’m born and raised in Florida and even though our government has a tendency to oppose revolutionary culture shifts like bitcoin, I’d like to become as connected as possible in this region, financially and intellectually. After checking out their website, I see they’re looking to expand, and would be very interested in filling whatever position of employment they’re looking to fill that I might have applicable/marketable skills for.

It’s true haha. I guess the trick is climbin out of the free labor pit ��. I’m heavily invested regardless. Even if I don’t have an employer per say, I still serve to benefit from the marketing I suppose.

I don’t believe that they’re fraud per say. But I will say I don’t see any advantage in going through an atm like this, as opposed to a traditional web based exchange. I’d like to point out how interesting the location of this atm is. It’s in a very low traffic, insignificant convenience store that’s a attached to a gas station. Very Haji-Martesque. The bitcoin movement is very real my friends. Even in a first world country with an economy as stable as the U.S. HODL FOREVER

It’s just an exchange. In goes your cash, scan your QR/input your receiving address, done. Bitstop takes 13% as a transactional fee.

Hmmm. It may be your only possible solution then. It comes with a pretty hefty transaction fee though.

A Kwik Mart near the Colonial/SR-436 Overpass

I can agree. 13.5% is a pretty fat number to slap on as a transaction fee when you start looking at significant quantities though. Then again, most people investing thousands or more in bitcoin probably aren’t buying at an atm in a Haji Mart.

How do you figure
