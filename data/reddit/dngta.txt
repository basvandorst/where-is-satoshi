It's only 1 address I have to worry about. As of this moment I have approximately $30 USD equivalent in there so I'm not super worried because it's basically pocket change.

Well this was a fun way to learn I didn't write down my passphrase anywhere. Lost half my coin.

Is there a tutorial out there yet that is extremely straightforward on how to get my BCH and BCC or whatever? I've had everything sitting in a Bitcoin Core wallet on my local PC since before the split and haven't been able to get it sorted.
As far as I can tell it goes something like:
1.) Move all coin out of wallet.
2.) Install new client for BCH
3.) Copy Wallet.dat over
So can I transfer coin out of Bitcoin-Core to Coinbase and make this work?

Thanks, it's actually less than $10 USD at the time of transfer. I challenge the world to do a hard fork to recover $10!

It's on Coinbase. Didn't want to mention up front because OMG people hate Coinbase here and I felt that would detract from getting useful answers.

Watched it last night and unsure how I felt about it. The good point is it's a decent historical rundown that's consolidated. On the other side of the coin the documentary was clearly shot to push a certain feeling. At the end of the movie you hate the government, and you love the bitcoiner underdogs. You also thing the old fogeys are old... what was the point of those segments?
I feel the same way I did about the American Anarchist documentary. It was neat but was really tailored to push a certain idea and not to just present facts.
Regardless I think the biggest issue with the documentary is the speed of technology. I don't know when it was made but it's already outdated to some degree. If I shot another one over the next six months on the same topic and spent another six in post-production again, I'd be outdated by the time it was seen by a viewer.
TL,DR; Neat time-capsule. Incomplete story. A bit biased.

Was not intentional... can I haz Bit Gold anyway?

I started with NiceHash and got my first payout middle of this month. I thought I'd nailed the trends and traded over to Ether for bigger gainz on 6/20 and you can see how awesome that was. I'm using my desktop PC so infrastructure was no cost and I sold enough for cash to offset the electric bill and buy a coffee.
I feel like I walked into the casino with free chips and no idea what blackjack is. I'm sitting here disappointed sure but laughing my ass off as well. I have no future as an investment manager.
