I don't mean to be rude, but if you can't do simple math, you should probably stay away from financial investments.

UK here. Bought few times in the last years. My most recent purchase in December was stopped by the bank. I verified that it was me using the card, still got stopped. Had to speak to 'fraud prevention' asking all kinds of personal details until the I was able to buy. They certainly don't like people spending money on crypto

Stay away from trading until you understand some basic concepts.

Next time I'll buy it will either be Coinbase or Cryptopay. F*** Coinify. That's all I can say.

BItcoin made me more money, while I was asleep, than I made during the night.

I've tested a few and if you don't mind spending few £s, Crypto Pro is an absolute winner. Great iphone app with portfolio and alerts. Great Today widget. Several types of tickets for iWatch.

You ever heard of mortgages?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:26:55
Check bank statement from that period. May give you a hint as to where it was purchased. Emails are also a very good shout.
Where I found my old wallet was a backup of an old computer saved on cloud storage. 
If he's not shitting you, it's worth every effort to find it.

That's fine but most people buying a house tend to have deposit for say 10% the rest is mortgage. Saying that anyone buying a house has 250k sitting in their fiat is ridiculous.

There's my 0.05p gone. Glad I only started with them last week.

Don't you just love it when someone tries to tell you what to do with your money. Especially when it's a money investment. Careful, you're about to lose some friends when bitcoin dips and they panic sell with a loss.

Technically, シ doesn't have a meaning. 死 means death. Now the pronunciation is the same, but a single katakana character bears no meaning.

It's the legacy one. In which case I could just import the keys to Electrum and keep them there. 
What would you suggest for long term, keep them in Electrum? Then sending to a wallet like Jack or Coinomi for payments?
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:05:22
Well we all know well it's NOT over 9000 ��

Thanks. I never considered cold storage but it makes sense as these coins sit there not being used anyway. I'll look into those.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:35:57
IKR. What would we call that?
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:25:34
Yeah, blockchain offers to import those but with fee. Thanks, I may hold off from moving them for now until I need them.

In a distant, post-apocalyptic future, who knows what will be the currency. Cigarette butts sound like a possibility.

On the wiped note, I do data recovery and it will depend if the laptop was used a lot after the file was deleted. If not then there's a good chance to recover a deleted file even with some free tools.

No need for the 'k' after you've spelled out the '210000'.
Also, don't assume you know the other person's situation.

I'm only 0.13 BTC and wanting to reload but waiting for it to drop a little bit more. Still happy with that. Been sat on it for some time now.

I found a Multibit wallet on my Google Drive from 2013. Managed to get it to blockchain and I'm now £700 richer lol. Good luck recovering your coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:53:32
I've been hodling since 2013 and just managed to recover Multibit wallet files and the funds. Transferred to something supported currently and it's all good
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:10:53
I'm keeping my BTC and not really stressing about the drop. But I don't know if I should be watching Bitcoin Cash to sell it off at the top or keep it once BTC starts growing again.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:43:05
All I needed was my wallet id and the private keys. I had to export those as a file from the wallet. Then just entered those on blockchain and now I can track it. Just don't lose those private keys until the funds are transferred to a modern and backed up wallet (in my case, blockchain)

Thought the same when I first saw it. Made me gag ��
It's still a terrible blanket / carpet.

When the bank networks go down, do you really think internet will be usable? If a global crisis like this comes, how will you pay with your BTC for that food rations and ammunition? Bottle caps seem to be better choice of currency for a scenario like this.

They purchase the goods in fiat so the end product will be based in its fiat cost, hence the price changes. It will not be valued in btc until btc is so widely adopted that businesses can trade raw materials in btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:54:45
Right. I'll just take my mobile eye to another bank so that they can benefit from having funds to invest rather than the first bank. Enough people do that and they'll have to give in. In an idea world where people cooperate...

Judging from some of your comments, you're an American (but I may be wrong). So all this is a bit rich from someone who's country is about to become a dictatorship and Russia's vassal state if your people don't get out there and do something about the fuckey that is Trump/Putin coop.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:54:34
Edit: seriously what kind of an argument is this? 1. It has got nothing to do with the comment. We all know what I meant. 2. What do you call a citizen of USA? Oh... 'an American'. 
Go troll elsewhere.

Maybe he had enough to sell some but is still hodling?

First foray into bitcoin on 19th November 2013 followed by multiple top-ups. HODLing to the moon :)
