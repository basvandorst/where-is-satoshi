...which either you or an intermediary source misunderstood or is misrepresenting. The deaths the illegal drugs caused in that study were not violent street crime, but deaths due to *medical* issues arising from substance use/abuse. Because, you know, illegal or legal drugs actually can be very dangerous.
Your statement doesn't even pass the common sense test. The world saw a *total* of 437,000 murders last year.
And you're here trying to claim that 57.2% of *all* murders worldwide are due to violent street crimes related to the trading of illegal drugs? No, I don't think so. You just misunderstood (or credulously believed) a number on "drug deaths" relating to something else.


It's likely that no one actually died because although Ulbricht was a criminal with murderous intent and *tried* to have people killed for money, he wasn't a very *good* criminal and got scammed by "hitmen" to take out potentially fictional targets.

The collective hashing power is for 21 Inc, but the subsidies via discounts would not be collective. Individuals would collect them. You can't treat the business model one way going one direction, and other way going the other direction.

Everyone investing in Bitcoin hoping it will rise in price is viewing it as a commodity. Holding (or "hodling") Bitcoin is a good sign that someone is viewing it as a commodity, or simply hopeful that their losses may be recouped one day when the commodity rises.
Bitcoin is a process and a structure. To a great extent, those who see the price's rise and (more common) falls as irrelevant are more correct in terms of what Bitcoin could be about. If you're using Bitcoin to do what it is good at, the price is irrelevant.
But the bubble and the current pricing are due to people trying to invest in Bitcoin as a commodity instead of a process and structure. To claim otherwise is to turn a blind eye...and the reason for turning that blind eye is up to each person, I guess.

This is a business-friendly and recipient-friendly wire transfer system (no chargebacks). If you are a consumer or sending funds, you need to be very wary.
This is a major barrier for actual usage-after-adoption by businesses. Of course businesses don't mind the system that allows payment with no consumer protection or chargebacks. They love it!

The volatility of the major currencies is a placid lake compared to bitcoin's volatility. A steady decline is NOT volatility, in any case, and the decline of these currencies (even with inflation) is nothing compared to what we've seen with bitcoin.
These posts are delusional. They used to be jokes poking fun, but now people are (unbelievably) *actually taking the idea seriously*. These posts also broadcast to the world how much bitcoin is about the speculation that we may yet see another bubble, rather than bitcoin as a tool to be used. If you're using bitcoin as an investment, think hard about that.

You are not in a place to "give it back so hard," Bitcoin is far more volatile than the vast majority of fiat currencies. There are complaints about inflation with fiat currencies, but they are truly bizarre when you look at the massive and unaccountable valuation fluctuations in Bitcoin -- which for over a year now have been down and down and down.
For its purposes Bitcoin should really only be held for the shortest time possible to facilitate a transaction that necessitates it. Holding it is gambling and speculating, and not using it as a tool, and putting yourself at risk of its massive fluctuations.

The CHF-EUR exchange rate has been stable for a long time. This is a one-off central bank decision around a well-known "false" peg of the CHF. In the end, it's not even close to 25% increase in CHF:EUR, it very quickly stabilized to around half of that increase at 13-14%. 
CHF is a great store of value, useful as a currency, and increased in value because of this issue. The removal of the EUR peg is mostly an issue for Swiss exporters and those with debt in the currency -- *neither of which is really applicable to a comparison with Bitcoin.*
Bitcoin has very rapid and unexpected valuation shifts, based on speculation and seemingly nothing, all the time. The comparison works for about 30 seconds for agreeably-minded people. But in the end the comparison falls apart of specifics of each currency, their usage, their actual history apart from this one action, and makes Bitcoin look worse, not better.

My condolences, then.
The Euro rises and falls through the years, but is still a great store of long-term value and a great reserve currency. It's down now, but it goes down and goes up and when Europe recovers it will recover. Its depressed nature, of course, will help the Eurozone economy vis-à-vis exports. The Euro, for its purpose, is doing very well on both long (overall stable, reserve currency and store of value) and short-terms (acutely depressed when economy is down and needs boost via exports and domestic spending).
Any comparison of the volatility and risk inherent in bitcoin vs. the Euro will not be good for bitcoin. Bitcoin was not, ideally in terms of the main goal, supposed to be what it currently is. But there's no stopping people from using it for this purpose (speculation, shorting, manipulation, etc.), so this is the actual reality of the system. And it will never not be this, and this is too volatile to be a held currency and too risky to be anything more than speculation.
It's a wire transfer system that involves currency conversion.

Users, or as is most often the case, *holders*, do not themselves give bitcoin value. Users/holders give bitcoin liquidity or non-liquidity, and they affect the price up or down (as the case may be) through demand or lack of it. 
But price is not the same as value.
What gives bitcoin value is the fact that it is actually functional for its use cases. What gives bitcoin value are the miners.

The FDIC limit is $250,000 for each bank the person has an account with. In 2008 regulations were passed permanently increasing the limit, along with other temporary measures.
So a person could be insured under FDIC for whatever amount by simply dividing their money up (which, if they were that concerned about bank collapse, might not be a bad idea anyway).


The FDIC doesn't cover this, that's true. There are other policies, laws, and regulations that cover unauthorized transactions and mandate correction of a consumer's account balance. See the Fed's "Regulation E" for example. Note, as well, that a consumer being negligent doesn't remove their rights as a banking customer.
The venture capitalist, as one would expect, seems to have a good handle on secure stores of value and the protective regulations governing fiat-based banking. The recent actual history of dollar deposits and bitcoin shows that dollars are indeed protected better both by the companies that hold them and the regulations surrounding them.

The interpretation is not that complicated, nor should it vary too much from person to person. 
They were trying to trick Jesus into breaking Roman law by advocating non-payment of taxes. He got around the question by saying that the money was Rome's and so there was no religious issue with paying taxes and giving the money back. It also had the side effect of buttressing Jesus' other parables about earthly wealth vs. divine wealth.
Repurposing it as some sort of libertarian commentary on respecting other people's property is quite a tangential leap, then, since it was a clever remark about how paying taxes with government-issue currency was perfectly fine from a religious or political standpoint.

I agree with the second part...Bitcoin can't fall to zero (or near it) unless an exploit is found in the core. Such an exploit should be part of anyone's risk analysis in terms of *investment* in it -- not the usage of it, which can take place instantly without too much concern about the future viability. But if there are users, it can't fall to zero. If it works, it won't fall to zero.
Putting too much faith in the network effect, to address your first point however...networks rise and fall. AOL. Friendster. MySpace. The network effect is inertia. It's not solidity. It's not the "future" by necessity and by definition, it's the "now" with the ever-present threat of erosion.

Everyone here is excited because this means bitcoin's price may go up -- this is "it," the moment when mass adoption by a major retailer will increase demand and use of bitcoin, leading to the much prophesied surge in the prices. So everyone is holding, waiting to get rich from doing nothing. So mostly no one will buy anything from Rakuten.
Eventually some of the holders waiting to get rich by doing nothing need other *similar* holders to give up and spend their bitcoin. And every holder thinks it will be someone else. So everyone has to pretend that they're spending and will spend and are excited about retail options.

No, national currencies are not now more volatile than bitcoin.
There are basic economic reasons for the strong dollar relative to other currencies, mostly the refusal to raise rates but also as a better store of reserves/value compared to the euro for the time being. There are political and economic reasons for the euro underperforming (name Eurozone instability), and being less attractive in the near-term.

Hoppe makes it clear that he, and people like him, are the ones who should judge (since he's given us this list in the first place).

Removal of gay individuals, pagans, practictioners of "individual hedonism" (whatever that means), is not un-libertarian? Really?
Hans-Hermann Hoppe is not a libertarian, no matter the label he applies to himself and applies to others. He is a socially conservative nativist, more interested in tradition and order (selected and imposed by people like him) than he is in personal freedom. This is readily apparent by the above-quoted passage. He wants to impose his ideas, his beliefs, and his structures on society -- not just in part, but in full, to be realized by the literal removal of people who dissent from society.

It is likely not, and to the extent you take contributions and don't return them to the people who gave them, you will be in violation of a state law.

This is a little much. He openly is for suppressing dissent -- this is a positive and not a negative according to him, and it's not some slur it's precisely what he proposes. He says he wants to physically deport people who conflict with his ideology, and drilling down further his specific interpretation of his ideology. 
I do not want the same for him, and have said nothing about physically removing anyone from society. 
Comparing our two "suppressions" of dissent, where I point things out and he physical removes people from society, doesn't result in anything close to the same thing.

I don't think he's concerned about his average cost. He is concerned about his buy-in prices because of what they *were*, and wondering how big a mistake he made by buying them when he did. Buying more doesn't change the price of what he already bought. It just has him spending *more* money for the illusion that he paid less for those other ones. It's true he could bring his average cost down, but he can never actually bring the cost of the bitcoins already bought down from what they were without spending *more* money.

Well, I specifically said:


And yes, he did say one should pay taxes in this case:












It really is one of the most easy-to-understand and straightforward stories in the entire New Testament.


I guess, but...


The full quote is that one should render unto Caesar things which are his, and unto God things that are God's. Caesar can't demand things that are due to God (worship, love, divinity, truth), but worldly things that belong to Caesar shouldn't be held onto, including coins issued by Rome. 
I would say that personal/private property is far more akin to worldly wealth and gov't coins than it is akin to *worship* or *love*, and that the majority of the New Testament points to that being the case, but your interpretation is yours.

The % of revenue in BTC has plateaued.

You said bitcoin is more scarce than gold. How did you come to that conclusion? 
And, even if you can work out a way to compare the two vis-a-vis scarcity, I can produce MS Paint drawings of goats in jpg form, and those would be more scarce than both gold AND bitcoin, these drawings could be encrypted or chopped up into milligoatpix and sent worldwide with a verifiable blockchain to document ownership...but it would be insanity to posit that my MS Paint drawings of goats in jpg form would be more valuable than either. 
Demand is an important part of this equation. As is the usage of the commodity. Gold's use in the economy is different than bitcoins (and both vary in use from my MS Paint drawings of goats in jpg form).
Your argument is economic sophistry.

Governments don't have to pass a law about this. Miners' transaction fees are part of the overarching bitcoin protocol/ecosystem that will become more and more relevant to everyday usage as time goes on.
The government didn't pass a law saying that all transactions should go through credit cards. Nor did they pass a law saying that merchants must charge checkout surcharges. There was simply a settlement that said merchants were free to, if they wish, up to a point. Credit card companies fought against this. Merchants don't have to accept credit cards at all, let alone levy a surcharge.

I worded that in context with the OP's post, using his wording ("individual stocks") as it was clear he meant it. It was perhaps too vague if not read in that context.

That's exactly what's happening here. Free markets have "big money" and small money, and "big money" has the advantage in a free market. 
That's how it goes. It's part and parcel of a free market, and whether you label it as a "game" or "manipulation" or whatever, that's how a free market will function if it's free.
If you don't like it, don't participate or advocate for regulations that protection "small money" from the actions of "big money." It is truly absurd to have any ideological, principled, or demagogic stand against "big money" or "deep pockets" while at the same time cheering a free market and minimal regulation.

No, not always. But much of time, yes. However, this makes it certain that merchants won't dissipate that transferred-cost to attract customers or with a mind toward the methods their customers actually use.
This will make it so that the customers is always paying the fees, regardless, and the merchant isn't. 
Given that the merchant wants/needs certain payment options available, this is nonsense. The merchant should bear the responsible for pricing in fees (or not) when trying to attract business through increased payment options.

(a) On what planet is *that* percentage of a decline a "flash crash"?
(b) Yes, the Federal Reserve realizes the dollar is strong enough that they're going to allow it to devalue some to protect US exports, given the overall historically-large Euro decline (look it up, when was the dollar last at these levels? Edit: [to make it easy, a ten-year chart]( 
The uncertainty in the Eurozone has led to a flight to the dollar, but this also means that the US is not as attractive a place to invest, since local US costs (labor, resources, everything paid for in dollars) are all higher. The US is still a pre-eminent manufacturing and export country, so this becomes an issue. This decline in the dollar is exactly what was intended from today's Fed meeting. Not sure how anyone is managing to spin it as something terrible. 
This decline the dollar had today is the *point* of having a centralized fiscal policy -- the dollar was getting "too" strong and too many people were rushing toward it as a secure store of value for it to retain its ability to act as an international currency for trade for US business, so the Fed tried to talk forex markets down. And they did.

So your old job paid you enough to buy-in to the tune of 60 BTC with "extra" money (depending on when you bought that'd be around $20-40,000/year in "extra" *disposable* income) and gave you a free car.
But you *quit* this for a job that left you barely enough to get by, and without the free car? 
And with all that, a mortgage and the sudden, allegedly voluntary, loss of *tens of thousands of dollars* a year in disposable income, leaving you with just enough money for necessities, what you're now concerned about is selling off bitcoin at a loss to buy Xbox games and shoes?

Depending on how he does it. 
In the most optimistic setting: he is asking everyone how to convince the daycare to accept *bitcoin*. This is no different from having the payment sent in a foreign currencies and resolved to USD by the day care center or Bitpay or their bank. So, in every way important to them, it's a foreign currency -- either they have to do more work or there is an exchange conversion occurring via a third-party which could vary in a way that USD payments for USD billing would not encounter.

A lot of these things look like ways to push transaction fees *purely* onto the consumer, instead of the merchant. 
I recognize that transactions fees, as it stands, are sometimes hidden costs. But this is making it so the consumer will always bear the brunt of the fees as opposed to the merchant sharing those costs based on their customer base's use of credit cards.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:56:07
People rarely invest in individual stocks (edit: I'm using OP's terms and context here, "individual stocks"...what I mean is people rarely invest in *only one* stock, as OP is warning against). They diversify, either on their own or through a financial investment product. This is what everyone should do.
Whether bitcoin is a part of that diverse portfolio is up to the individual. Whether bitcoin users should view it as an *investment* is another question.
It is not very difficult to invest in stocks or funds either. It's very simple to do, whether on your own or through your employer. There are many brick-and-mortar and online pathways to investment.
Investments in stocks and funds, however, don't offer the lottery-like thrill of potentially being a millionaire tomorrow. Unless they are penny stocks. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:30:05
No, not always. The fee can be mitigated somewhat, or not priced in at all, if the benefits of attracting credit card business outweigh the cost of pricing in credit card fees. This is the merchants decision, based on their circumstances and business. That's their calculation to make, and if lower prices combined with accepting credit cards and those fees mean more actual revenue, they will do that, even if it means sucking up some transaction charges.
When the transaction fee is paid by the customer directly, *that* is when it's always paid by the consumer.

What they mean is that in certain ranges of deflation the investor, had they just kept the cash, would have more value than if they hadn't. But just keeping the cash is less secure than losing the small amount they could have made otherwise.
If someone buys a bond for $1 with a 10% interest rate, they get $1.10. If inflation is high enough to erode the real world value of that additional 10 cents, they would actually lose money. 
Conversely, if someone buys a bond for $1 with a NEGATIVE 10% interest rate, they'd get $.90 back. But if there is "only" 5% DEFLATION, that results in them losing money, since they're losing 10 cents but not gaining enough of it back through an increase in real world value.
The construction of the situation is not that great, in the CNN article, though.

The "dotcom bubble" is famous, over a decade later. It's taught in colleges and its effects resonate to the present day. How you can pretend that it's not one of the defining investment debacles in recent memory is beyond me.
Are you under 20? Maybe that's it. The fact that you brought up Facebook leads me to believe you don't have a firsthand memory of all this -- Facebook was years from being invented during the dotcom boom.
Things like this should be covered in high school but they often aren't. There is only limited classroom time. But high schoolers think society at large is as unaware as they are. Well, sadly no.

This story is, of course, actually proving how attractive fiat currency is, and its clear benefits. Not that anything has gone *wrong* with the euro (or the dollar). But that things are going so right with them that investors are flocking to them for security and stability.
Investors have a choice. Germany is rock solid, and as a protection or hedge it's euro-denominated bonds are amazing. The USA was, due to miniscule inflation but even more miniscule interest rates, in the same boat for a while with its dollar-denominated bonds. This is what the market supports -- an excellent product at a market-determined price.
All of this is made especially possible by very low fiat currency inflation rates, despite years of fear-mongering about QE in the USA and abroad about hyperinflation.
