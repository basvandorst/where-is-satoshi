Why would I want to use a crippled version of bitcoin /crypto? These companies are trying to divorce the bitcoin technology from its politically disruptive nature.

Then again, you can easily hedge your bitcoin, or peg it to another currency if you so wish.

My experience has taught me lots of people think this guy is an 'idiot'. To me, he seems to be speak a lot of sense. Then again current consensus would also likely declare anyone saying just that as an 'idiot'. Funny world we live in atm.

I really like Ninki atm also has a great mobile app. Id' also recommend Mycelium. Keep an eye out for Darkwallet, it's in Alpha atm but looks and feels great.

What are ridiculous policy, a major problem with centralised exchanges. In theory you could sell your amazon purchases for cash and then send it to ISIS, or you could just buy fertiliser direct from amazon, all makes absolutely no logical sense. Why are they trying to take some of the best qualities out of bitcoin?

"Others look to Africa, Latin America, and East Asia as possible sources of new demand. (Myself, I hope that people in those countries will be able to see through the marketing and stay away from bitcoin.)"
Why? I think these people have the most to gain from the technology. With the write education, someone in a less economically developed country with an unstable currency can invest their earnings in bitcoin that is now easily diversified into other stronger currencies and / or precious metals (many more possibilities to come). Bit reserve, coinjar hint at the things to come 
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:10:34
but Bitcoin is a pretty important experiment in the worlds history so far....no?

"We're decades away from that being even a remote possibility and suggesting that is pure stupidity"
Why? 
Whats happened in the last few decades...mmm maybe this thing called the internet that came out of nowhere and is changing the world more and more everyday. I'm not arguing Greece should switch to BTC but your argument based on market cap and volatility is weak, I don't think you get it, the valuation would go up as people adopt it. You can in theory hedge bitcoin against anything so no biggie. Bitreserve, conjar hint at the possibilities to come. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 10:33:03
1. It's makes it easy to have control over your own assets, it massively reduces friction in transferring value. 
2. In time bitcoin should become less volatile.

Thats not what I said, but each to their own. I've donated to plenty of other causes I just happen to have never donated to Wikipedia. The fact is if it was easy to donate with bitcoin I know it would encourage me (if they had an option to tip on each subject page that would be even better and probably a great way for them to increase donations), because I think its a great project, but not the only good project worthy of a donation. It may also encourage other people to learn about and adopt bitcoin, which I think would benefit open source projects like wikipedia greatly in the future. No I won't be donating a huge amount to offset the "lost donations". I believe the idea behind wikipedia donations is that they should benefit everyone who use the resource personally by helping to build a better encyclopaedia, so yes I'm pathetic

Ok, I completely disagree. More of a gamble then the US$ at this present moment in time? Yes. More of a gamble then the Zim dollar was pre 2008? But the volatility doesn't have to be an issue as I just explained you can easily hold your bitcoin with the volatility hedged inline with the prices of a precious metal or fiat currency.

There's a beautiful thing happening at the moment. As a lot of people are only learning how outdated (understatement of the decade) the current financial system is by looking, learning and comparing the traditional system with the potential of a Bitcoin ecosystem. Once they realise this, the solution is right in front of them. CRYPTOCURRENCY! In a matter of hours and with a little education, one can emerge from total ignorance that they've been living within a form of financial slavery to a basic understanding of the core issues and immediately become part of the solution (buying btc). Could revolution be any easier?

@_date: 2015-03-01 11:23:42
Until the person you bought it for receives it and clicks he has online, the bitcoins are then released from escrow as I understand it. Alternatively I'm working with a new peer to peer bitcoin trading site based in london [Roolo]( at the moment we also offer EU, US$, and CAD$ trading but theres little liquidity in US$ atm (might be one for a couple of months time). Message me if I can help. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:28:38
I'd disagree with that - Some are obviously pump and dumb but if you think theres no further room for improvement and bitcoin is as good as it will ever get, then you start to sound pretty similar to all those who are happy with the legacy financial system. I think some alt coins could offer a USP that bitcoin doesn't - take folding coin for example. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:53:38

Thanks for the feedback. The payments methods vary depending on who you trade with, but the idea is you can search for traders by the payment methods they offer. The Barclays Pingit app for example is free to use in the UK and works of your mobile number rather then bank account, resulting in much faster transactions and giving away less information than traditional bank transfers. (It's got nothing on bitcoin though). Video in the works
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:18:45

@_date: 2015-02-17 16:57:47
We are aiming to be faster (using green addresses), more secure (using full multisig wallets) and cheaper (we charge 0.5% but more importantly are hoping to provide a more competitive, transparent market than localbitcoins)

Maybe the state won't be able to do huge innovation projects, like the manhattan project. However I think he misses the point that much of this innovation will now come from the private sphere. It's early days but the internet has enabled people to organise themselves and these projects from any point they have internet access. Increasingly innovative forms of capital enabled by this like crowdfunding, peer2peer loans etc. have already attempted to fund skyscrapers and space missions. Additionally projects like folding demonstrate the potential distributed computing could potentially have. There will be huge innovation projects in the coming years that are enabled but individual people not governments. Bitcoin is an early, incredibly important and unique example of this.
