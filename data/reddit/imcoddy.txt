BTC NEEDS DECHINALIZED!
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:45:28
Did u try this?
I might be willing to buy some btc if u r around roppongi, but this is not really a good time to buy as I think there will be a dump :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:15:58
You made me laugh XD
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:22:11
Bither is also open source as well, not only iPhone and android, but also desktop version and other parts.
Here is the link for iOS version.
I have contacted the dev team to do more advertising, after it has been recommended on bitcoin.org, but since it is a small team of four people, right now their main focus is to make better app first and don't have too much resource to spread it out .
Anyway, if you guys like this wallet, you can share it with other bitcoin folks, and make some feedback on the github page to make it better :)

Haven't seen such a big bitcoin giveaway for a while. Upvote!
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:24:26
Lucky to be the last one. Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:26:00
The Tokyo bitcoin meet up should be helpful, they have regular meetings. 
Or u can contact me if u r in roppongi area. Send me a dm if u need.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:09:21
Count Me In!
@_date: 2015-05-12 23:25:56
Thanks for what you have done
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:26:03
Oh yeah it's Tuesday again :)
@_date: 2016-03-16 14:44:33
Give it to my girl and then I can help her fund the card :)
Is this event US resident only?
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:38:16
Yes, I feel it as well that some company are fighting over for the power. Didn't know it would cost such safety risk to hard fork to 2m first, thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:35:46
Thanks for pointing out the typo mistake.
I think Segwit won't be out till April, are you sure it will be released faster than the hard fork?
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:27:12
One Vote for Trump, and for the bitcoin :P
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:12:11
Nice sharing.
As a matter of fact, I personally think brainwallet is the best way for newbies to make their first bitcoin address, as it will be a lot easy for them to remember and can recover later. Of course, don't put too much bitcoin in it. Don't you ever put too much in your first bitcoin address!
And out of that, recently I created a simple app based on brainwallet, it is called PassworK and helps user create better password by remembering something meaningful to them. Here is the link to try 
Since this post is about brainwallet security, the donation address of PassworK, 1DNpE2i4H4bCRd6ezcgv3bL13Uc8GCEEPo, is also made from the brainwallet.org. Other than 12 random words in OP, the donation address is a meaningful phrase of 14 words. Take it out if you happened to find it out, or donate a little bit more if you like it, or share it to encourage other people, just leave me a message after that :P
@_date: 2015-08-04 22:27:01
We love Tuesdays :-)
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:23:36
Thanks for the reference, that's exactly why I created this app.
Human are not good at remembering stuffs at all, unless that info has meaning to him/her.
I also think currently 16-bit-password is not a good option for many people either, and it is better to use a long phrase as your password, which is exactly brainwallets do, and PassworK adapts that and create a fixed length unreadable password upon it.
But anyway, maybe people are not interested in using this method yet, maybe they have their own ways, or not so easy to be changed  :)
@_date: 2015-08-03 04:19:20
Nice work, waiting for the update :P
@_date: 2015-07-25 02:58:38
Personally I prefer 聡 （≧∇≦）
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:17:06
Well done! Two years is a long journey in bitcoin world :)
@_date: 2015-07-25 00:24:57
Well it sounds pretty good, but I have a little doubt. 
Exchange foreign currencies cost high fees, since this service is USD based, what's the advantage to buy this in Chinese Yuan?
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:52:09
Nice Tuesday again:)
@_date: 2015-07-11 04:41:00
Run into the one-in-a-million club already and hope to see you there :)
@_date: 2016-02-25 06:27:08
No worry. Several Bitcoin ATM here.
There is a meet up here in Tokyo so you can trade with ppl out there, or trade with me if you come at downtown Roppongi :)
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:13:52
Just search Tokyo bitcoin meetup then you are good to go.
I don't use those ATMs as they are charging too much comparing to exchanges, but yeah you can use English to do the trade in case u don't understand Japanese 
@_date: 2015-04-29 14:53:24
Oh it's a great Tuesday again:)
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:27:21
Just signed up. My id is 192551
I just hope you guys can have a better interface on mobile
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:51:14
Personally i use Bither 
It is open source, securely generates private key, provides 2 modes as Hot vs Cold, multi-signature supports. No TouchID support yet but the team will make that happen soon hopefully. Pretty good enough for daily use already.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:04:43
Thanks for spreading bitcoins
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:11:35
coming late but still thanks for spreading bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:25:32
Love this sunny Sunday :)
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:05:49
Probably I cannot go there because I need to work.
But for bitcoin fans in Tokyo, you should definitely check out the local meetup :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 14:17:05
Love to see post like this. Thanks for making bitcoin moving around :)
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:23:28
I love this Tuesday :)
@_date: 2015-04-25 08:41:46
Wow thanks :)
@_date: 2015-11-09 14:49:59
To da moon!

For most coins, cold storage is a must. Just print the private key and store it in a safe place.
Personally I use a personal version of brainwallet.org to keep a small amount of coins as a half-cold storage, just because it is a handy tool for me (I know it ain't that safe, just pray for my coins lol), and Bither App as primary hot wallet, as it is secure enough and support HD.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:50:34
If you want to buy low and sell high, use BTCC.
If you just want to exchange bitcoins, I suggest haobtc. Check the link below :)
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:55:50
Nice Wednesday Here And Happy Chinese New Year.
@_date: 2015-10-31 14:11:52
Well, when the price goes up, ppl will deposit more cash in to buy, and ppl will send bitcoin to sell. I think it will cause more transactions.
Also, price increase means you can buy stuff with less bitcoin than before, also increases transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-14 13:16:22
Here is the truth: this guy made a mistake and thought he was trading on the Chinese market :P
