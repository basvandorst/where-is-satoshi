What? 
In a txn where three inputs go to two outputs (above article example), you can still conclude that the prior owner of the total balance controlled the private keys to those inputs.
Otherwise the txn would not be possible.  What am I missing?

I preface this with, do a small test txn first
A = Get your full balance to 8 decimals 
B = Estimate a reasonable fee
Spend A-B to your new address with B as your fee

- Less technical debt added to Bitcoin
- Creates a hardware product market (chips) for more vendors to gain revenue streams on top of Bitcoin, reinforcing bitcoin as a TCP/IP type protocol layer

It is one of the simplest curves, and unlikely to have any backdoor
y^2 =x^3 +7x
Page 9
The elliptic curve domain parameters over Fp associated with a Koblitz curve secp256k1 are specified by the sextuple T = (p, a, b, G, n, h) where the finite field Fp is defined by:p = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F= 2^256 −2^32 −2^9 −2^8 −2^7 −2^6 −2^4 −1 
The curve E: y^2 =x^3 +ax+b over Fp is defined by:
a = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000b = 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000007
The base point G in compressed form is:G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 59F2815B 16F81798and in uncompressed form is:G = 04 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 59F2815B 16F81798 483ADA77 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B800000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000000055A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D955A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448
Finally the order n of G and the cofactor are:

I've been trading for 20 years, and spent many of those years writing bots or creating trading algorithms.  My experience tells me your algorithm needs to learn over time, and any simple algorithm just won't work.

You need to respend their txn, as a child to speed up confirmation, by adding a higher fee

Some wallets may have a restriction allowing you to respend unconfirmed txns.

All funds in an address are made up of discrete inputs.  Inputs are a prior transactions outputs.
In order to spend the balance of an account, you need to reference each input.  The total of inputs has to exceed outputs.  The amount by which inputs are greater than outputs makes up what becomes fees.
Fees are incentives for miners to confirm your transactions

That's not how Bitcoin works.  The broadcasted transaction potentially stays in the memory pool, until it hits a time out setting which was recently raised. If it never confirms then the inputs to the transaction are never spent,  and can be used to create a new transaction, after the time out period.
Alternatively one can make use of child pays for parent, and broadcast a child transaction with a larger fee to get higher priority on being included in a block.

If you wanted access to the bitcoin immediately here's what you could do:
Open the help menu &gt; console
On the console tab, type in the box:
    - Walletpassphrase ThePassword 600 (if you have a password on your wallet)
    - dumpprivkey 1AddressOfKeyYouWant
The client should now spit out your private key for the related address
Now unfortunately you have to convert that private key to a format a lite wallet can accept.  Bitaddress.org  can help you do this by using the "Wallet Details" tab.  Entering your private key you also be given a QR code.
Scan the private key via a QR code to your phone wallet and then re-spend the funds to a new address in your phone wallet to remove the risk of exposing your key to a third-party (bitaddress.org)
Sorry if this is over complicated and confusing.
The best thing to do is just wait for your wallet to sync

The public address is a hash of the full public key.
Your wallet creates new addresses for all change from transactions along with receiving new funds.
Your wallet is made up of many keys with coins being made up of inputs to those addresses.
Wallet software's main purpose is key management.
If your wallet uses a seed, a 12 word phrase, that is your master private key in your wallet.  Your wallet knows how to derive all addresses from that master key.

Bitcoin has a few very large differences from your example that provide it intrinsic value:
- its immutable and irreversible, providing a public ledger of the true history of events.  This has enormous value as a new invention to society.  Don't underestimate this feature 
- it's has a limited supply and fixed issuance unlike how fractional reserve banking works, so it's very different from debt card transactions and more similar to gold.
- even if Bitcoin fails, hundreds of others set waiting to take its place.  The writing is on the wall, superior money has been invented.  Fiat has been made a dinosaur, and Gresham law will prove it.

No one "told me" this.   I've been here over four years, and my understanding is as follows:
- nodes relay transactions and enforce consensus based on their configuration.  From a consensus perspective the impact to the network by a non-mining node is propagation time for any block or transaction that is considered invalid by said node.  
- mining nodes do the same thing but actually create transactions relative to that configuration.
In the end confirmations that confirm consensus are governed by mining nodes only.
So what am I missing, or we just tripping over technicalities?

Most of the user base that got burnt by Mt Gox distrust third party storage.  Coinbase has gone to great lengths with their Vault storage to try to regain that trust. 
Personal hot wallets or wallets generated on corrupted devices is likely a very large portion of wallets, as you have to invest a lot of effort into proper offline creation or Multisig address creation from multiple devices.

No they don't.  Miner consensus, and the software they choose is all that matters.  
Nodes just relay, and show public support.  The subset of mining nodes will always represent the core consensus network, as only miners create blocks.
This is why the centralization of mining is a fear.  I.e. Why some think big blocks will create further centralization.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:59:33
To get anywhere, you have to get a miner to change their software.  That is the primary issue.  What makes a miner change software?

As of Block  there are about 46 Million outputs in the UTXO set.
If we had to upgrade, and the fork required all txns to be spent to a new addresses, to implement the change, it would be a mess, so hopefully a block size increase would also be part of the fork.
Again, everything would be up to miners, as they govern consensus.
Since it would be in the best interest of the community to salvage as much as possible I personally don't worry about this type of event much.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:29:18
It will work fine.  New addresses are created to help prevent people from address re-use that creates a loss of privacy and has a slight risk to security (if spent from and reused)

Coinbase holds your coins, they used an input from an address that had 16+ bitcoin in it.  The output was your txn and their change.  Once confirmed every new block added to the blockchain pushes your transaction deeper in the chain, making it more likely it will never be undone.  It's how it works.

That's not multisig, that's deterministic seeds
Multisig is a "3" starting Bitcoin address, built from multiple keys.  If these keys are created on multiple hardware, then the keys become hardware agnostic in terms of security.

It fixes at least two issues.  One is that currently you can create multiple transaction IDs for the same txn, which can trick some website wallets when you publish the same txn multiple times.  This was what was used against Mt Gox to leak coins out of their wallet.
The second is layer 2 technically needs to remove this multiple txn feature to build a layer upon the original transaction layer.
Basically transaction IDs are not currently deterministic, and Segwit fixes that.

A double spend is attempting to spend the same output from the UTXO into two or more separate transactions in a blockchain
A fork creates a second chain, and the UTXO is valid for each chain.  Spending those coins on each chain, is not a double spend, but a separate spend on a valid chain.

No it is not.  Coins are being mined every day, which is inflationary.
They are being mined more slowly over time, which is Disinflation.
Bitcoin is not deflationary until all coins are mined, and only because coins are lost/destroyed over time.
[**Deflation is a contraction in the supply of circulated money within an economy**, and therefore the opposite of inflation. In times of deflation, the purchasing power of currency and wages are higher than they otherwise would have been. This is distinct from but similar to price deflation, which is a general decrease in the price level, though the two terms are often mistaken for each other and used interchangeably.](

Your private keys in the hardware wallet will allow you to spend on both chains.  You'll need to extract those private keys and manually build txns to split your coins to separate addresses or wait until ledger provides the hardware wallet with a mechanism to do so.

Miner incentive changes due to game theory on SegWit witness data confirmation and insolvent exchanges are our largest black swan triggers.
The positive swan, is that Bitcoin will carry in it an uncensored data layer, allowing for freedom of content and a monetization method for that content.

Even if you build the replacement, few will relay it, as they see it as a double spend, and it will be rejected.

No fees.  It will generate keys anytime you use the request payment option. The primary reason for using a wallet like this, so that your entire account is backed up by writing down the seed.

Hopefully you saved the private key, and yes math is what derives the public key from that private key.
A wallet will manage this math for you and make the process of keeping track of keys much easier.
Most Wallets today are HD, which means they provide you a set of master keys derived from a 12 word seed.  These wallets generate key sets related to the 12 word seed. As long as you know your 12 word seed, then you can recover any of these addresses later with other wallets that support this format 
Some wallets allow you to import single keys like the one you have.

Keys access coins on chains.  If a split happens, those same keys pre-fork will access all versions post fork.  You'll need a client post fork that supports each chain split, and the import your keys into each client.  You'll then be able to spend each version of the coin separately.
You'll need to wait for all this upgrading to occur, which will take weeks to months to sort out.

It may help to explain why we do this.
There is a global currency war going on like never before.
Currency inflation at a low rate does two critical things in a global society with competing currencies
- encourages local spending
- pushes deflation to countries we import from 
We are globally all at war with competing currencies, in an effort to improve our own back yard.
It's one huge game of try to ripoff the neighboring tribe.
Inflationary currency gives the tribe leader power over other tribes at the expense of screwing his/her own people.
Bitcoin makes everyone a tribe leader.

Bitcoin is a clever system making use of various encryption and hash functions.  Humans have a hard time understanding the scope of large numbers.  Both of these make this possible

The nice thing about Jaxx, is that if you use it across multiple devices you can put the same seed in every time and have the same wallet across devices, but at the same time this does expose you to more risk.
When you import a private key to Jaxx, I believe it generates a transaction in that process, which in that case it would create a transaction fee. 
Some wallets do not do that, but that can create a false sense of security where if that device failed, those imported transactions would only be recoverable if you also maintain that private key.
Per Satoshi, he foresee never deleting or destroying any private key.

Intrinsically it seems possible if it obeys a formula like PV = nrT (pressure, volume, temperature).  Where you could reduce the time to send data, with the offset being that it just required more time to uncompress.

So if Trump's plan was to buy back debt (assuming this market condition occurs), wouldn't the conditions he described be horrible for bond holders (i.e. Boomer generation)?
If so, then I expect this to happen.  The boomer generation is sitting on what they think is a "free lunch" but there is no way this can come to fruition without other consequences.

I expect a price decline currently as people are fearful. Eventually the majority will realize the best position to be pre-fork is holding your own private keys. I expect this to push up price considerably, and then eventually after the fork we will see a selloff on both sides. Eventually things will stabilize again.

This is not a problem, as this is how sound money should work.  Lost coins just proportionally adjust the value of the remaining coins.  Coins are also divisible to infinity.  Theoretically the system could work on just 1 BTC.

Correct, fiat money is subsidized through inflation, which is a hidden tax affecting the poorest disproportionately.  The Feds mandate is ~2% annual inflation to incentivize the population to spend and consume versus save.  The spending incentive further incentivizes debt.  Buy today that which will cost more tomorrow.
Deflation kills this type of monetary system. 
So expect a lot of inflation in the near future.
