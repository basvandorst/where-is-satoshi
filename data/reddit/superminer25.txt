That's annoying. Thought buying with phone credit would be a good way to stop fraud aswell? Or is SMS yet another form of payment that can be charged back?

The best way to compare purchasing power in my opinion, is what food you can buy. "gear" isn't really a great comparison as technology evolves, food does not. (exception comes into play when technology improves farming etc)

I literally just started doing this and I only keep a small % of my BTC on the exchange, for obvious reasons.
As far as I'm aware, no one has ever defaulted on a loan so it does seem safe in that regard - However keep in mind that if price tanks or rises and you have your BTC on loan you cannot access them, this would also include that if your coins are on loan and then BTC hard forks (or any other crypto) the person who has taken your BTC for loan will then be able to claim the coins from the other fork. (at least, that is what has happened in the past.)
If you are going to to it, I do recommend you only loan what you can afford to effectively lose. Since you have no control over what happens to your coins while it is on loan and in the exchange - It could end very badly.

Go to the pair that you are trading your margin against and scroll down to:
"MY OPEN ORDERS"
Cancel your order, then facepalm.
EDIT: Should probably add that this happens when you attempt to margin buy but your order is never executed because the price either never dropped that low or went up in the time you took to place the order.
The loan is taken as soon as it is available (to buy the desired crypto for the margin trade) and that is why you have fees.

As much as I can understand your frustration, I am finding it kind of hard to believe that this isn't just an issue between the keyboard and the chair.
For your own sake please go to the page that you margin trade on:
 (for eg)
scroll down to the very bottom, between MARKET DEPTH and TRADE HISTORY. any open orders are there and it is the only place to cancel orders that were never executed. If it genuinely isn't there then I'm sorry I doubted you. Easy to miss though - I missed it and I thought similar to what you are thinking now.

Damn. Sorry dude. I really hope you get it resolved ASAP. And they better refund any losses.
