Are you being serious now? They have absolutely nothing in common. It's like crying for the inventor of dollars to fix PayPal as you cannot send money on YouTube. Makes no sense. Bitcoin is currency. Changetip is a service. Service which made it possible to send bitcoins in YouTube comments through their systems and bots. Nothing to do with the currency or the developers of the actual currency. Nothing.

I like buying with normal SEPA transfer and that's what I've been doing do far. I could imagine liking and using credit card buy even more, but so far I haven't found reliable European site doing this without ridiculous fees. For me as of now it doesn't really matter if I get the coins right at the moment, because I already have quite nice reserve and the price is stable enough. I like your site and idea though and congratulations on getting this far! I had heard about you before, from here reddit. :)

Nobody cannot answer these questions for you. I personally believe over $1k value will be reached latest next year and if all continues going well, bitcoin spreads and more people starts to use it, then it will be much much higher by 2020.

You don't have any kind of account. What you are referring as account is wallet. That wallet only holds the private keys to bitcoin addresses you can control and use. Each time you create new receiving address the private key is saved on your wallet. They do not expire so yes, you can still send coins to any address you have created with MultiBit as they are all saved on your wallet and you are thus holder of those private keys.

Electrum. Lightweight and secure enough when used wisely.
