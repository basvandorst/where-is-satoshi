Don’t regret it for not doing it 10 years from now. Your grandkids will thank you for it

Truly an expert prediction.  Your wise and transcendent words shall ring for ages.

Sorry to hear about this.  Your family sounds like greedy, selfish pieces of shit.
I would distance myself from them and focus on those who are close to you and actually give a damn about your well-being instead of your money.
Much love, my friend.

Try accessing Coinbase using a VPN, should do the trick.
