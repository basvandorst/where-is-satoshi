I can vouch for  using BTC. I've purchased from them over the past year without any issues ever, they are fantastic. I used to use Amagi as well, they were my very 1st BTC to Gold purchase and it was a good experience.  Man, I ALMOST went with Amagi last night but went with Provident.... Sorry and I hope Amagi makes it right asap.

Share the details - Others don't mind to help but RL/Family takes a huge chunk of R&amp;D to get on the bandwagon to help out - the more details the more folks get in to help...

If you/someone could write up a new r/bitcoin/install for linux noob/semi experienced I would install and run all three on a free EC2 Ubuntu instance.
Like others I really want to help the cause but RL crashes in and makes it hard to ramp up on another OS/Commands/ETC.
Make it dead simple and other will follow step by step to help the seed cause and not leach

I still have access to EC2 instance's from an old/dead site I owned. 
Still have data in S3 &amp; Glacier so I am paying a small $ to keep it active. 
If somebody links to or lists here how to install QT in/on EC2 I'll crank up a free instance and have it run. 
I can get an instance cranked up, just need the linux commands to download/install and run QT.

Thanks for this!!!! I've setup and completed the install on a VexxHost - with port 8333 listening - 
How long before you see your "Connections" : 8 grow to more when you look at bitcoind getinfo??? Does the whole blockchain have to download before it jumps to more than 8???
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:10:06
Allright, I believe I've successfully installed QT and got bitcoind configed and running... I've also opened up TCP 8333 in the SecurityGroup. How can I test to see if I have more than 8 connections and am SEEDING and not LEACHING?

Sounds good, thanks for the update.

Could a Linux guru write up a new r/bitcoin/install for linux noob/semi experienced? I would install and run all three (bitcoind

btcd) on a free EC2 Ubuntu instance. If they can live in peace on same server...

No luck getting more than 8 connections in Ubuntu... Trying the free Windows Server version.... Maybe because Free Ubuntu is paravirtual and not HVM?????
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:40:09


Awesome, thanks.... UGhhhh I am only at 8 as well... :( Let me try to re-swizzle some security settings and I'll let you know how it turns out...

To help the cause I setup a VPS with vexxhost.com - similar to digitalocean but you get 2TB of bandwidth for same $5
Customer services was/is great, had an issue with initial SSH setup but they resolved and am up and running a bitcoind -
FYI - it takes about 30min or so to grow from default 8 Connection to more  - I'm at 11 connections after about 45 mins.
Thanks to all for laying out some great details/info on how to help out.
Who wants to take on writing up for:
