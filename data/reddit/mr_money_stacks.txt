That brings me to another point. They didn't announce they were launching the futures until Dec 1st. I am sure they were talking before this announcement, but we cannot tell when the talks started.
But essentially they had an idea, that probably took a lot of peoples time with regulatory hurdles as you mentioned, they launched this idea relatively quickly, then stopped with the little experiment after only 15 months.
Most things in the financial world move slowly and change slowly, hence the reason something like Bakkt is taking forever to get approved. Why is the CBOE future so easily ramped up, kept for such a short time, then removed so quickly? Again could be all a coincidence, but just knowing how corrupt the financial industry is, and the convenient timing makes me wonder.

This probably closer to the correct answer, my post was more of a what if than anything.
I still do find the timing of it very very curious. The futures launched literally within days of the peak and first ones expired just after the "2nd" peak. Then they close up shop just after what looks to be a bottom forming?
There is a damn good chance its all coincidence, but the cynical side of me cannot help to at least recognize these coincidences.  
As far the multiple bear and bull cycles, almost all bull markets were ended by some event that causes the momentum to change and essentially pop the bubble. Maybe it wasn't necessarily that the CBOE was created to pop the bubble, but it is entirely possible that it was was caused the bubble to pop.
