What a great reply, lemony-cricket.  It has become very apparent that our weak link to social progress is how little human nature has evolved when compared to the efficiencies created by technology.   "I don't discuss for cash".  What a hoax ( I wanted to say what a load of shit but this is my first post, lol)!  Is it because it is created into existence through debt, and therefore, you find the compensation below you, Pretagonist?  
The blockchain movement has been spearheaded by intelligent individuals that wanted to change how our liquidity is created.  Along the way deployment of of code into a blochchain platform became possible.  How in the world is that not an improvement?  I am a big believer in Dan and hope his goals, even if only parts are met, are realized.  We will be better off for it when compared to our current system.

Great post!  Where Oliver failed miserably is how he never mentioned why we are here in the first place.  Most people do not understand that our liquidity is created into existence through debt.  He laughs about bitcoin totally unaware that the money in his pocket is not even his, lol.  
EOS has the potential to not only protect our rewards and privacy but protect our knowledge and be rewarded for the work of learning.  It is a new day soon where the "victors will get the spoils" but this time the warfare is knowledge.  So apropos the quote is from the Andrew Jackson era.  The first one one to realize that the central banking system was a real sham.  
I am here defending the project but would be perfectly content if it went lower for obvious reasons.  Maybe some of the naysayers don't have funds to purchase and are hoping for a lower price, lol.....doubted though.  The lack of intelligence is evident in their writing, the simplicity of their thoughts, and obvious lack of real world experience.
