Thanks for the recommended site for buying bitcoin in Europe - i read some reviews which seem far more positive than other bitcoin exchanges that i've researched. 
I live between Belgium and New York. Does location matter in regards to which site i choose (i can deposit both Euros or Dollars)?
Perhaps i'm too early in considering the turmoil over. Yes exactly - I feel that even though the price may drop, if i invest in the long term then it might be more realistic to make a sold return.

Great thanks, all three will work perfectly for my location and and currencies. 
I did notice that Gemini seems slightly more complicated to use - especially with waiting until the trade auction goes through. Though I think this would be the best site for getting the cheapest rates / price. 
Kraken also looks really good with regards to pricing and user reviews, though I feel a little daunted by their interface. 
I might go with Bitstamp, despite higher commissions, as they are located in the UK and have some solid feedback from users as a site to get bitcoins with a credit card. Though here again I'm not sure if there will be limits for visa / mastercard purchases &gt;10k usd?

thanks for your in-depth answer. I appreciate the time take to address my question. And that list of sites to get bitcoin gives a great starting point for any newcomer like myself. I see that you and other users here recommend both Kraken and Coinbase. I'll probably go with either one depending on whether I choose to buy with my credit card or just deposit through a bank transfer. Bitsquare looks really cool too, I might play around with this once I have invested. I'm comfortable with technology, so that learning curve you mention will be a nice challenge.

that was my idea too, but i guess in the long run with bitcoin you just need to not sell too early and things will work out fine

OK point noted. Are the actual good sites to buy btc with paypal or do people just pay other sellers directly using this? I'm looking to get &gt;10k usd so would there be a limit?
