? ��
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:34:07
Cool. Now make a screenshot like I just did.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:25:12
Dude, this is going to be like an exclusive community if it's not already.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:23:04
Btw why this transaction going from so many addresses? Your wallet generates many addresses and use them all for one transation?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:51:44
It wasn't the wisest idea. Half of them went on hookers and wine, the other half on some stupid shit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:32:38
So street prices are always higher?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:07:15
Obviously you can :) The difference is, you cannot "withdraw" from this address and I can.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:05:58
Hahaha nice one!
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:32:04
Can I mine with it?
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:50:15
Where did you set those triggers? Do you use any special platform to automatically buy/sell?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:18:14
Yup, I learned it already! :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:45:24
No, I won't bump your fucking thread. I will downvote it immediately.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:32:58
I am all in to put that 100$ even if the chance of this going to be worth a lot is just 10% - this is still better bet than hoping to win a lottery.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:26:48
Oh that would be a very bad idea to exchange everything to altcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:30:59
Totally. The current price it's just a top of an ice berg.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:34:39
Yeah. Seems like this is still the best way. So sad it's 2017 and acquiring BTC is pain in the ass :/
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:11:43
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:22:17
Wait few more years and you will be surprised.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:25:37
It's irrelevant. It will bounce back 10x this. Now, hodl my beer...
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:21:43
I honestly don't know how to do that. But I do enjoy Photoshop.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:09:32
Haha why?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:31:59
The guy who spent 10.000BTC on pizza probably cannot sleep at night :(
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:02:27
Yeah I was wondering same but at the end decided to attach the screenshot to my post to not pollute the thread with comments like these. Agree we should establish more trust among the members here.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:28:12
I am sorry to hear that. Try PayPal, I heard their fees are low, like 3.5%.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:01:14
It's going to be millions or 0, I believe.
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:03:30
Boom! Applied 20% OFF across all plans for Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:34:21
Same thoughts here. There is enough of people out there who will spend it fast. My message reach only those who are thinking about cashing out but consider long-term investment (and hopefully they will hold on).
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:31:21
&lt;clearing up my back account&gt;
No but really, considering tomorrow withdrawing half of my money from a bank.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:28:51
You had a service? Nice! I've just started accepting BTC and other crypto on one of my SAAS platforms - 
Shoot me a DM, I am up for new projects and collabs :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:25:22
Some people will, some not. Some prefer long-term investment (like myself), other trade, some other spend daily on products/services.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:53:51
This is an awesome idea actually! I will adjust the price and offer 20% OFF for any plan if paid with Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:59:04
I am using  - kudos to the people behind the project! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:20:43
Oh man, I hope you get enough of them and kept untill now.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:30:23
Oooops! thanks bot! :D
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:08:59
True. That's what I am going to do now. Use spare cash I have and keep exchanging small amounts, no matter what current USD value is.
Regarding buying on credit - I would never do that. I promised myself if I want to buy a car either I have a hard cold cash or I keep riding my bicycle. Nothing between.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:24:03
What benefit do I get (and Bitcoin community) running a UASF node on my computer? Please explain because I am not familiar with UASF topic.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:37:18
You are getting an error?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:20:06
Ugh, that's an expensive laptop! :/
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:13:16
Okay, I know is silly to ask for "trustable" service after all the stories in the past but did you actually tried any of them and did you get your coins without an issue?
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:54:52
The rate is calculated automatically based on dollar value so you can be sure you only pay what is the equivalent of USD at given moment - no more, no less.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:28:44
Keep up the hard work :) I am going to put part of my bank savings into it and even if I to loose it all, I won't feel bad.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:24:53
Now the question is - **WHERE ARE ALL THE COINS?** :D
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:29:34
They sell for way more what is current price.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:14:39
Yeah I just saw the story of that guy who took a loan and invested all in Bitcoins. Good move but I would not have balls to do that I think.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:31:47
To *my* address ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:05:05
Cheer up :) Opportunities are like buses - there always will be the next one. Wish you best!
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:38:49
I will remind you in a year to repeat this thread. Then I will write the same comment I am writing now.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:36:07
I am running Twitter automation tool ( and I wanted to offer to users an alternative to a credit card. Bitcoin fits in perfectly.
P.S. PayPal would take me longer to implement lol
