Here is the arbitrage opportunity!

Liquidation will leave us with almost nothing, guaranteed! I strongly urge anyone with any power here to pursue one of the rehab options. I don't have enough insight as to which one is preferable, but it has to be given a chance...

It's not going to come from PC usage - it's going to come from mobile innovations. Keep an eye on [bitpesa]( for example...

Similar position &lt;100 lost, completely devastated. So sorry for everyone out there that lost btc here. Is there any hope that we'll get any of it back? Thank god for DOGE coin at least!

I would have lost all my btc (around 100) if I hadn't moved some into DOGE coin at Christmas! Absolutely gutted though, and feel like a complete idiot. This is such a disaster - is there any chance we'll see any of that again??

Thank you!! The kind of attitude shown by the Dogecoin community in particular can be harnessed to change the world, and should be mirrored by the btc and other coin communities. It's happening already, but in just a few years time, a large majority of the poorest people in the world will still have very little, but the will own a smart phone. Lack of access to financial services is one of many reasons (but a big reason) that keep billions of people in poverty. Crypto currencies, and the growing infrastructure around them, have the potential to change that. Can you imagine the positive impact that a whole community of developers looking to increase access to services for the poor utilizing or even just funded by doge or btc could make? I would encourage all of you with a voice or skill (as some of you are already doing, regardless of your coin preference), to use it to inspire or create innovations that actually make a difference - and are sustainable (through revenue/profit or otherwise).

Similar boat, friend! I've lost probably 60-75% of my assets - more money that I could have possibly saved through putting money aside (working for non-profits as I have been), as I was an early adopter. 
I'm feel terrible for everyone that may or may not lose coins or fiat as a result of all this, but I more curious than anything else myself. I almost feel honored to be part of this piece of history - who knows how transformational this movement will be in 5, 10, 50 yrs time. Whether I get any of this back, it's already one heck of a story.
