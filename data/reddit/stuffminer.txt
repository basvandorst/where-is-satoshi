Good on you kabayan, for doing what you do... This is why I'm passionate about Bitcoin because it can empower people. Great potential for the future...  Please post pictures abt your project soon. It's a shame  Doge lost some of its value recently..
Mabuhay  ka.

Looking forward to using your api soon. It is evident to me that  btc Is economical In micro payments. Also, to be competitive with other remittance services, you may want to find out how to get the money ready for collection within few hours. Ria remittance can do that now. I know it's challenging to get to that stage... Well get there.

Yep, cold storage is the to go... Encrypt the keys as well using BIP38 maybe. Last night, I did this to my small btc. I made sure that my keys are working by adding small money first then spend it. Yes my keys went online for split second using 'cold storage' spending app feature. I'm parananoid that I put too much rigour in cold storage and encryption but in end my private keys can't be used. So my advice ensure to can spend your btc from cold storage when time comes.

We did not make bitcoin easy enough to use... More work to be done guys...
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:22:05
Ahhh ok... So my suspicion is correct. More and more btc companies are creating exclusive products and centrAlized services. This defeats the purpose of btc... 
I want to see developing countries adopt to bitcoin, exclusive products does not help as this equipments are so expensive in the first world let alone developing countries. 
Bitcoin is for all, rich and poor. My mission is to make this happen, not only for advantaged groups but for all groups.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:57:44
Lol.... Please pips.... Bitcoin is not there yet... It will be in the next decade or so- if we as a bitcoin community became mature...
bitcoin has no impact to current financial system yet... We only have around 5 Billion Market cap.... Hello...
It's something else....

I hear you bitcoindigger! 
Some early adopters and geeks are bunch of whingers, and some are not living in the real world... Some sees the problem and concerned but are not doing  about it. Some want cryptocurrency as exclusive to Geeks and banked and are not friendly and smart assess. i believe this is not the intention of Bitcoin. Note: I said SOME. CEX is just attractive. I mean, do you really think my parents will use Bitcoin if it's hard to use? I wish I was one of the early adopters so I had time to bank more btc and develop more tools for others.
Why do you guys think Microsoft,Apple,Google are successful and adopted by most people? Because made the hard - easy... 
What can we do now? Lets vote and push Chief Scientist and team  to adjust the core Bitcoin protocol to dis allow mining pools to control say&gt;30%.

Another Boom!

@_date: 2014-06-29 20:34:27
Haha... That's Dad's dream... I remember my wife asked me one day, abt RC CAR- 'really? You want an expensive remote car for your son, or yours'
@_date: 2014-05-19 07:25:37
Good! Let's grow the btc economy.

GPUs are not the way to go for BTC mining. ASIC is the way to go.
If you are mining  you will not going to get any profit.
Nowadays, we are talking abt Terra Hash speed for a profitable mining (with some conditions).
 But obviously for fun,you may use GPUs. I suggest you mine Vertcoins instead.
By the way, I started using the block eruptors and raspberry pi to mine btc. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:26:27
Because Bitcoin is hard to use, very high risk, high exchange rates, government put warning signs every where etc,etc... 
Snapchat is just cool for some people .
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:28:28
What a question.... Hmmm.... You even own more btc than me.. I don't how you got those 24 btc and still asking this silly question...

Simple, but if works for you, do it. I did have a strategy and worked but requires time as expected. When I got busy with family and work, I in bad position. Oh well. Such is life.

I sort of like the volatility within reason. +/- 5 % is ok

While most see the crash as a loss, I see it as an opportunity. I'm a late adopter, I wish I did learn abt this earlier so I don't have to binge study.
@_date: 2014-05-28 06:49:50
Read more before buying... Be careful... Dont be trusting...
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:49:04
We have to get the core developers involved. So many smart people around but we lack the will... I'f we need to raise a levy just to get this done quickly, properly lets do it.  Honesty I have only a few btc, I'm a late adopter. I regret it... Some early adopters do not care anymore they're cashed up already. Some are gone.
@_date: 2014-07-29 07:24:00

Congratulations, igambletoomuch. And thank you for reminder... 
I speculate btc, I sold them all now... Not a huge gain, but that's ok... I don't want to fall into this. Gambling trap... What I know Is blockchain technology Is awesome. I'm planning to invest in bitcoin related technology... 
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:05:21

The strength of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is in Maths  and its community . That's why I'm a supporter.
Yes, Bitcoin is not perfect, yes there are greedy and unscrupulous people in around btc. But most are good people and reinforced by Maths. I would imagine more fine tuning will be implemented soon. 
If BTC is compromised, there would be a more strong system to fix it. Btc technology is not going away.

Ouch... You dont say that to people? He/she obviously is trying to convey something in English... Racism has no place in this era. I can't believe it... You have the currency of the future but manners from Viking days... Does not make sense. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 11:31:08
I'm now annoyed- asking btc without any reason... Yes Bitcoiners are generous but tell us why you need the money? I mean, mining is
@_date: 2014-07-30 07:13:03
Why can't we just focus our efforts in 1 coin. Make it robust add features, experience etc... These pump and dump coins as nuisance... Well some are making money in the expense of newbies.
@_date: 2014-05-18 05:56:06
Noice....

I'm not sure abt greenaddress.it system but as far as I can understand coins are in the bitcoin network not centralized to one repository. As long as you have your active key pairs backed up and greenaddres did not spend your btc or hacked. You should be able to access your btc using armoury, bitcoin client, multibit etc. 
So the answer is yes, with some conditions.

That's robocion. There are other manufacturers.

@_date: 2014-07-17 04:58:55
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:46:29
Great start..  the first question would be, are the core developers willing to accommodate fine tuning/are they willing to listen... And start fleshing out options with the community. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:10:21
Whatever... 50% means risk is higher not gonna fall over if higher security is great..

Been there, done that... In the end its not  a worthwhile exercise.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:08:06
Yes panic now, then price will go down, then I'll potentially buy a lot, then things rectified, then price will go up. Then I'm rich... Hehehe.... I'm a late adopters that's why.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:50:08
@_date: 2014-08-05 07:18:21
Yep, it's appealing.... But I would say it's a pump and dump... Which is pretty normal to most altcoins...

Woohooo!!! Seatbelt on... Highest altitude please...

Cold storage is good... Just be careful where you buy it... Buy now!!! It's cheaper
