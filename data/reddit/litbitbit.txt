Use gold/silver to buy crypto? Or use crypto to buy silver/gold? WHy not both.

this might be why they're rolling out BitconnectX on Jan 10th? I wonder. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:26:52
False. I'm against Bitconnect even though I'm still invested for another 200+ days. I never reinvested, but the measly returns that I DO make, I withdraw. I've done this numerous times.
I signed up with $100. Not my own money but someone who couldn't convince me to join with my own money. That was two months ago. I've made an ROI of $37 to date. With that same $100, I could have flipped it 4-6x easily doing my own trading (which I do daily with my own money). 
So I agree with your first sentence. Disagree wholeheartedly with the last sentence. 
Also, the referral program is outrageous. I know people who invested $100 but refer people constantly and now make anywhere from $20-150/day. I'm not annoying like that, I can't just spam the hell out of people so I don't benefit from referral bonuses :(

warning warning warning do NOT use these machines. There is a tax fee that takes much more than 8%. Proceed with caution. I tried it with $60 just to see how it works. I now have $12.60, which is too small for me to even move off the wallet to another exchange. So, I'm out $60. To CoinCloud directly: I will make sure everyone I know, knows your tactics. I will also be letting local businesses who host them know, that this is a ripoff and will be boycotting their businesses until they have you come pick up your fraudulent ATMs.

If anyone wants to see the receipt and screenshot of my ONE and only transaction with this ripoff company, feel free to message me your email.

Also, I'll be forwarding ALL transaction paperwork to my the appropriate authorities in my city. This is a complete rip off. As bad as CoinBase can be, stick with them. At least you'll still have most of your money. AGAIN: PROCEED WITH CAUTION!!!!!!!!! You've been warned by someone who "took one for the team".

It's been bad for me as well, except for XVG and ETN. Def gonna hodl. And buy. Sorry to hear about the breach. I got taken for wayyyy less by a CoinCloud ATM yesterday and I'm pretty pissed about it so I can only imagine how pissed you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:41:30
Interesting. I've been noticing the opposite about CoinBase. Their prices are always higher than any other exchange and I've been trying to put my finger on exactly how they're manipulating the market.

I didn't panic either when all my non-crypto friends mentioned the dip (as if I didn't know already) but instead told them that this is an excellent time to buy. I may have even yawned, that's how unbothered I was. Interestingly enough, the dip didn't hurt two of my favorite alt coins, XVG and ETN.
