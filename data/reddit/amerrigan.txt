Mine arrived today too

I'm assuming Crypsy as the address I received this to is specific for them.

I got this today, opened it in a sandbox.
Basically the password protected .rar contains an executable .scr (screen saver file) trojan.

I got bored today, so I made this Bitcoin QR out of Lego's; thinking about framing it.
I haven't seen another on the various BitCoin forums, although I have seen a few threads mentioning making one.
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:05:10
I wasn't asking nor expecting anything from anyone; certainly not your kind of negativity. Granted a few people have tipped, of which surprised me and am thankful
I was simply sharing my love of BitCoin and Lego's on what I thought was an appropriate channel - I apologise oh lord of Reddit if I've made you feel compelled to type something, rather than simply ignore this post.

Surely it would cost more to 3d print them?

I think it takes about 500 years for ABS plastic to break down
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:47:50
Can I get your autograph?
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:18:45
Make sure you use Lego designer and try to maximise the lego surface area.  I worked out using 1x1 blocks (841 tiles) would cost about £50.
Also bricklink ( is your friend here :)

Perhaps ""Look, I made a wallet!" begging should not be allowed" posts shouldn't be allowed.
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:27:44
Shame he copied my post from Monday: 
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:00:45
Ahh good question!
Basically the Dark blue base plate was interfering with the QR scanning (for some reason). The base plate is 32x32 where as the QR is 29x29 so I used some white pieces to "fluff" it out.

Well it's hard for them to get the time off work at Starbucks or Apple this time of year...
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:58:41
worth a try, I guess
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:59:15
Errm is someone trying to spam ban me?
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:06:50
Thanks I hadn't thought of this from the non-technical stand point
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:02:03
Not exactly free, my time + materials. Plus I haven't actually asked for anything.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:27:07
Seeing as Overstock use the Magneto e-commerce package and that there's plenty of integration options for BitCoin and coinbase already I fail to see how this took "40 people" so long.
Something smells fishy with this story; kudos for being the first (and for all this "MARKETING"). 
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:29:38
You'd think with that much Lego kicking about, it'd be easy to find some cheap sets...
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:25:53
So no-one other than me noticed that the QR is actually side on?
for the OCD: it needs rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise (although will work from any direction).
@_date: 2014-01-08 19:57:54
LOL thanks, I got such a downvoting for mine and the usual "don't post that shit here" response from this lot (Dogecoin crowd seemed more accommodating)
I've seen three pop up in one week since mine (one on Lego sub) yet nothing prior to it; so got a little suspicious &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:36:13
IT'S A BITCOIN SALE!
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:38:21
I'll PM you
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:48:54
Thanks most generous.
I love BitCoin and will probably have this in my office for payments (or a different QR) - a bit more interesting than a printed one or Vinyl decal you'd agree.
Hey I may even sell these, if the interest is good enough.
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:48:50
Swept some old wallets and dumped the $300 worth of shitcoins (that no one else still trades) there only last week; balls!
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:10:22
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:34:43
Ahhh thats why it disapeared; I did a cleaning up!
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:42:45
as above just change your dns to google: 8.8.8.8 (8.8.4.4 secondary) very easy to remember.

I have the private key option disappear from my Iphone version, is it back? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:45:15
I plug my (333MHs) USB block erupter into my work PC so it's free magic money for me with no costs; Well it is if I forget about the initial outlay cost of $30 and the fact that I'll never make that back...
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:32:30
Damn, was too slow, it scanned easily enough though.
Private key (edited):
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:48:20
love to be in the jury of that one, imagine if the feds released the private key...
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:57:46
Hmmm... possible crowd fun project to be had here?
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:42:27
Wow brilliant!
Although not quite the same, I've got a Raspberry Pi sitting here doing nothing, I know what I'm doing over the holiday now!
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:12:52
Wonder if he has a backup of the wallet somewhere secret...
