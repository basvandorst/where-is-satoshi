I wonder if it was bank-specific.

Spoiler: All of them are correct.

Actually, yeah.
In order to regulate, you have to be able to take punitive action. How exactly would that happen without government?
If you are unable to take punitive action, then forget regulation because no one is going to adhere to it.

Bitcoin is decentralized, but to use it within a country you would have to follow that country's regulatory laws.

What's your annual rate of return? How long would it take to pay for itself?

So, are you saying that the value of building this box is to:
1. Create faster trades for yourself
2. Adds more redundancy to the Bitcoin blockchain network
3. Potentially earn small transaction fees

This is hilarious, considering the crazy swings in the cryptocurrency market the last two months. And the going rate is still less than half of what the three month high was.
At least inflation is somewhat predictable.

No, that's cool. Just curious if this was an investment or hobbyist expense.
What kind of bandwidth does it use up?

Yeah, trying to figure out if a Fox recommendation is a good thing or a bad thing.

Bitcoin is a first generation cryptocurrency. No way it survives 100 years, much less 1000.
Someone will learn from the mistakes of Bitcoin and other first gen crypto, and create something superior. That's not a slam on Bitcoin; that's just how technology works.

Bitcoin goes up when a deep-pocketed investor decides to sink a ton of cash into Bitcoin. If there's a way to predict that with a formula, I'd love to know it.

So, MBA grad here... just want to offer my $0.02.
In a traditional investment like stocks or bonds, you are trading pieces of paper (or digital assets), to be sure... but behind those pieces of paper, there's a company that is backing it up. That company has assets. It has cash on hand (hopefully). It a measurable output of product or services. It has revenues, and it has projected sales. You can add all of those things up, subtract out the debts, divide by the number of shares, and generally come up with a value for the stock price, right? Because, unless something is horribly wrong, the company is worth that much, at least. And as the company releases revised sales reports and projections, the stock price adjusts up or down, accordingly.
Now look at cryptocurrencies as an investment. What's backing them up? Nothing, really. Just investor interest. And as we are seeing, the more bad press Bitcoin gets, the lower its price sinks. The real floor for Bitcoin is $0, the price at which investors just don't care about it anymore and all blockchain participants have pulled out. Now, you might argue that the blockchain is worth something, though it's a bit of an intangible as a volunteer network of participants. Personally, I wouldn't put a very high value on the blockchain. Other cryptocurrencies are showing how easy it is to create their own blockchain. And you can't liquidate the blockchain to pay off the investors.
The point that I'm getting at is that the price of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are completely hype-driven. They are a wild rollercoaster of an investment that could come crashing down in fairly short order. I don't see Bitcoin recovering without either a new hyped story or another market manipulator.
