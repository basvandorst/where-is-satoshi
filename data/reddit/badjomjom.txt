I am amazed that the so called Asuka prophecy might be right again!

I just started 3 weeks ago and maybe lurking here helps me gain some knowledge about the process. Yes you got it right, I tried to transfer to an electrum wallet.
I might consider hardware wallet few months from now, my focus at present is to accumulate as much BTC as I can and secure it first in an electronic wallet. Majority here says that it is still good to buy, so that's my plan.

I'll watch this, thanks again.

Hi everyone I'm relatively new to bitcoin. I'm planning to send my BTC to an external wallet, is writing my seed phrase enough to secure my BTC in the wallet? And just in case, can I recover my coins using other wallets by just using my seed phrase? Thanks for the help!

Thanks for this! I'll read more to understand this better, good thing you pointed these things out.

I only tried once but it failed. I used Electrum.

I failed to transfer my coins, found out later that P2SH formatted wallet can't transfer funds to Bech32 format. Sorry for not clearing that one, thanks for the info anyway.

With the premise that you buy only with money you are comfortable to lose. I see nothing wrong about it, I see no reason not to buy something that you believe will appreciate value in the future and if it does depreciate, at least the lost money is the amount that you are comfortable losing in the first place anyway.

How can I add words to the seed? Is this a feature of a certain wallet? Yesterday I tried transferring funds for the first time, but it failed because the source wallet is using P2SH while the external wallet is using Bech32 address format. Can you recommend a wallet, I'm planning to store just BTC and no other coins there.

I will read more about that legacy wallet, thanks for the idea. Wow! You're so lucky to have bought at lower prices. But then again, thinking that it is still very early gives me hope. I plan to accumulate to a certain amount first then DCA all the way.

Thanks for clarifying this.
