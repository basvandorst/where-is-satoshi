I just signed up for Korbit, put 300,000 won in and tried to buy bitcoin with it but it locked my account saying I have to wait for 72 hours. Is this normal?

That’s old news. This is from a few hours ago today, but it’s all in Korean.

I don’t have a bank account in the US, but a friend does. I’m going to wire a grand over to him so he can send it back in bitcoin. If there are no issues, we’ll start moving bigger loads.

They are talking about shutting down the exchanges like China did.

Just got news about the regulations Korea is making next week. Some lawmakers want to ban all exchanges in Korea outright. Can’t find any news in English yet. It’s top news in Korean news today.

Won’t find out until next week. Some lawmakers are talking about banning exchanges in Korea just like China.

You sound like one of those overprotective soccer moms that has no concept of sarcasm.  I wasn’t seriously suggesting Kim’s missile launch as a 10K celebration.

You won’t be losing it if you just hodl it till that 65 becomes 650 or even 6500.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:11:21
Hodl tight. Don’t let the dip bugs bite.

I tried, but I damaged my balls in a weed-eater accident when I was 5. Thanks for the idea though. Gonna go convince my cousin to wack himself off to the moon!

Sorry, Randy. I was just all excited about 10k and all the inspirational posts.

Now is the time.
