Anyone who had alot of BTC back when it was almost worthless probably sold them as soon as it hit $1 - $5

@_date: 2014-06-05 16:27:58
download it again and just open multi bit. the wallet should come up. i have done it before trying to get a new wallet, delete the app and re install, and my old wallet just comes back up. on my mac at least.

@_date: 2014-06-19 03:48:44
1. Only to send coins too. Its pretty much for saving. 
2. Yes, it will be gone if you don't have the keys. Just make sure you have a back up of both keys so just take a picture of it or write it down and remember you password. 
3. ^
4. Search it on Blockchain and it should be there.

You loan people BTC and they pay it back with a %. You can find some people with really good rates, and its pretty safe. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:05:29

This could be a good way to get more people interested in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:13:38
why do they need to be Bip38 ? What does it matter if I printed them all of using the same printer that was bought new from the store and off the same computer that doesn't have any viruses. they have been there for like 6+ months and nothing has happened ? I just don't want to go through the process of removing all 20+  paper wallets and using all the fees and stuff. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 18:52:03

@_date: 2014-08-18 09:08:16
single paper wallets with 1 or 2.5 on each paper wallet then write down the private key for each and keep it some where else safe. also you can download the blockchain wallet and scan the 50 or whatever public keys as watch only and you will see if anything moves but it most likely never will unless something happens to the paper wallets. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 09:44:14
you could have coins printed out with the private key on the side in very small letters. it could be worth .1 btc each or whatever you choose. on 1 side it would have the Bitcoin symbol and amount and the other side would have the public qr code. these could easily be empty but people would need to make sure to check em before they accept em. because btc is re usable these coins can just be passed around until someone decides to take the coin onto another wallet, and at that point the coin would be worthless so it should be made out of cheap metal. nothing special. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:21:29

@_date: 2014-07-26 11:50:13
I was just wondering because I see the website I use to cash out uses XBT also. At first I didn't get it, but then I started to see it more and more. Where did it come from ?

Its not my company, I just thought I would post it because I hadn't seen anything like it yet for Canadians. I am from Canada and not many places accept it yet, at least around me. Although I do use the website to cash out sometimes, there is no fee for cashing out (after you trade BTC to CND) and the exchange rate is always good. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:46:01

it was in a video from someone talking. not sure who but some one that knew what they were talking about. he said at the rate right now it will be a lot less then what they expect because the rate we are mining now and the type of equipment that is being made for mining and in the future.

did you come up with the idea or write the code ? didn't think so. they can name it whatever they want. amir or whatever his name was is already most likely being watched by the federal agencies from USA if not all around the world. even though its an idea he could still be jailed for it. but he did release the code online for the market so even if something does happen to him, the idea is out there just like ross and silk road. i expect a big change in the coming year for the dark markets and whatnot.

maybe the  value will double and they won't even be losing any money out of the 250,000. maybe it will be more ? there will always be people mining in my opinion. if someone can run a computer to get money, they will do it.

@_date: 2014-06-30 05:30:37
ross never sent anything. if he is to get in trouble that would mean big changes for the internet most likely. if he gets convicted this would hold charlie shrem guilty because its the same. both companies that each person owned was used to facilitate crime. shrem or whatever with cashing out, he didn't actually give the people the money, his company helped it along. ross didn't sell anyone drugs, the company helped it along. so if i sell weed over Facebook and get caught this would hold Facebook liable ? 
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:58:34
bitch stfu i probably have more money then you AND more coins. LOL
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:55:26

a exchange in Canada lets you sell your gold for btc. there are many sites that allow you to buy gold for btc also, this isn't new. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:57:40
This person must already have an account or his phone linked to the atm because they require ID and a phone verification I'm pretty sure. so this would be after they already know who exactly is doing the transaction that it only takes 47 seconds. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 07:22:20
BS. they are probably monitored if there not logged LOL 
@_date: 2014-07-07 08:33:20

@_date: 2014-06-05 16:29:45
I usually lose money because I choose the worse time to sell. If i were to be trading today I would wait till it gets closest to 700. then sell and wait till it drops back down to 620. been doing it for like a week. but i usually sell on btce and lose money cause i don't have enough to trade with, like 5 fucking bucks and the fees kill me. so it sucksss. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:49:51
i know exactly. so people would pay more to get there coins right then. the only problem is i come from a pretty small town first of all, then the trouble of even finding a safe enough spot to put it, and pay the fees. I'm still young, and it was just an idea. i would love to do it but i don't think its in my range.

i have over 20 paper wallets on watch only on the blockchain app on your phone man, i have an android and you just scan the public key, the wallet is watch only. so if any coins move from the paper wallets my phone gets a notification and i can easily look at the address's to send more coins to my paper wallets.
