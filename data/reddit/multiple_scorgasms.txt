Use localbitcoins.

that price = scam

Yeah, for the ease of mind that I won't be robbed. And the escrow system of holding bitcoins until payment is marked as complete. It's totally worth paying a few quid above market price.

localbitcoins. instant verification...and 2 step authentication security. Best one for us in the UK

it's pretty simple really. if you can afford to lose the money you invest...then invest.
If you can't...don't.
