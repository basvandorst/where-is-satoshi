Oh I see! Thank you so much! I thought all the addressed under used were part of that heading, i didn't realize "used" was a sub category.

Our IDEAL date is July 12, but this is a very tentative date that will 70% shift. Because our venue is a high school we might have restrictions on who could sign up for alcohol and drug reasons, but we might be able to circumvent that using liability forms and security deposits. Again, we are very early in the planning stages. 
And yes, I would love to see what companies you contacted and what style you wrote to them. 
This is my second time organizing a LAN party and I tried to contact some 200 companies via email and of those about 5-6 said yes. But the ones that did MAJORLY hooked us up lol! $100s worth of prizes for just 50 people. Hopefully with 100 people we will be able to get more sponsors and maybe even raise enough funds to secure a LAN after this.

I did the same, but as I'm a lowly high school student, just with $200. I buy 10$ every Monday to average out highs/lows

Don't mine. Unless you have 100+ GHS you really aren't making anything.
1 GHS = 1000 MHS.
All mining nowdays is done via ASICS, which are 100s of GHSs

I like the idea of Sats, but I don't know if using cents is the right way to go. Part of the btc philosophy is to keep it independent to current day currencies &lt;hence the controversy with using the thai bhat symbol&gt;. I agree it would make it easier for the end user, but maybe a different name than cents would work better?

I don't mean to advertise, well kinda, but we're hosting a 100 person LAN party and part of the proceeds will be going to fund a TECH scholarship for high school seniors. If you'd like to donate btc to the effort, or have ideas on how we should assess the criteria for the scholarship and such, please message me! I'd love to give out more details
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:32:20
We will soon. We're still in talks with getting the venue secure. Because the venue is a high school, there might me some restrictions as to who we can let sign up, but we're hoping to keep it open to anyone under 21(for alcohol and drug reasons). Maybe we'll open it up more if we have a liability form/deposit. Again, it depends on the restrictions the high school places on us. 
Once we get the venue secure I'll do another post with all the relevant info as well as the link to the website. 
EDIT: We are hoping to make this an annual/semiannual event and hopefully we'll be able to raise enough $$ this time that we can rent a warehouse next time so we can have more control over who can come. It entirely depends on the donations we get and if the sponsors are interested in helping us.

Well, as to what's holding me back, I'm on a study visa in the USA, means I can live here and go to school here, but I can't work or earn an income. Also means I pay more for college AND am only applicable for small amounts of private scholarships, cause I can't fill out a FAFSA. Also, I can't take out loans. 
But I don't know if I quite agree with your argument. Bitcoin is a HUGE new space, I think we're definitely going to see massive job growth for atleast a decade or two. Hell, there's still job growth for Internet Startups TODAY, and that tech came out a while ago. 
I'm definitely going to see about doing btc related work while in college, but it'll probably more educating others for free rather than anything in which I get a major profit. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:26:53
Well it might depend. If we get it to be a school sponsored activity, then we can have cheaper tickets as long as we adhere to their rules. If we have to rent the venue, then we can make our own rules, just the cost of tickets would be a lot more. 
If we choose to do non school sponsored event, ticket price might jump to 40-60$. Again, that's just a rought estimate I'm playing with.
It will both a)allow more people to play since anyone could come (no age req or anything) and at the same time b)restrict people from coming cause large ticket price. Kinda all depends on if people would be willing to pay 40-60$ for the LAN ticket.

Hahaha I guess intentionally/unintentionally the payout of this puzzle also matches the payout of Bitcoin mining since mining is also raffle based. Luck(correct style/correct nonce) mixed with skill(correct answer/computational power)
good luck everyone!

Ahh if only I had seen these an hour ago. I'm printing out some paper wallets to show around my high school and raise awareness and I love this kind of simple design vs borderless funky one. These look really good!
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:23:33
Hey, turns out we just formed a 3rd party organization to run our LAN events. Means we have to rent the venue so the price is kinda high, but EVERYONE over the age of 13 is welcome!

Coinbase and such already holds 'hackathons' where best protocol app is given $$. 
I think what we need to see is to give BTC to the average joe, one that isn't a super genius.

Toughest part about this isn't the questions, it's not not knowing if my answer is actually wrong or just has wrong wording/punctuation
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:02:36
Thanks for the advice! Just to clarify,
1. I wasn't looking for sponsors for venue or cash, what I meant was that if we have sponsors we're more likely to get more players and hence are able to raise from funds from raffles/tickets/etc.
2. We hosted our last LAN at the highscool, it went great! It was 50 person. This time we might look elsewhere, but we get free network switches and power from the highschool, as well as free venue. 
3. We have a guy that brings in a power distributor for free since he's our friend. At the 50p LAN we hosted, our largest spike was at 96A, with regular load way under. So we assume 250A should be enough for 100p. We usually go 4-5 people per 20A circuit, it worked out great.
4. I was always under the impression that it was bad form to ask for specific products. The emails I sent out last time were more general. I didn't want them to think that just because they couldn't get us the specific product that they couldn't help us in any way.

I'm sorry, but this sounds like the worst idea I've heard. Tying bitcoin to the exchange rate of US currency essentially  makes it tied to the US dollar. The spirit of bitcoin is not that it is only useful if traded for fiat, but rather that it is a currency in it's own right, therefore have a unit solely based on exchange rate of ONE fiat currency completely looses that spirit.

As a high school senior planning on getting masters in comp sci, and doing bitcoin related startups afterward, I've been toying with the idea of holding a bitcoin information meeting for the teachers of my school + anyone else. It'd be cool I think if I had the funds to have them all gen an address and give them 5mbtc to play with, so that'd be cool. Plus a scholarship would be great too, since currently I am completely broke :p

I really want to get a hotel, but I live in the suburbs so might just end up driving to chicago for both days to save money

I am not 100% sure about this but I believe the gains/loss only apply when you covert btc to fiat, in which case using a second address won't help because you'd also have to show the New corresponding fiat you received for selling the btc

July 13 is our working date. Just some formalities to take care off before we can start selling tickets. It would be 12 PM to 10PM. Hopefully next year we can do a overnight one and such. 
You can register at our website to know when ticket sales open up. rhawkgaming.com

If it's just a couple dollars, I'd suggest changetip. Easy to understand, and it let's them have some sort of wallet while they figure out how to set one up.

Jump off a cliff.

That btc would probably be better spent funding peacekeeping operations in the region that are actively fighting Nigerian slavers. Buying the girls out only helps to increase the incentive to capture and sell girls because now the slavers will know they can get away with selling them
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:24:45
Heads up if you're still interested in attending. Ticket sales should open up within the next week or so, our website is rhawkgaming.com

*sniff sniff* I am very jealous :( 
Why does BTC Chicago have to cost $240 ? :(
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:09:10
I am looking for something that is able to offer discount codes as well. 
Basically, the user goes on the site, clicks the pay with btc button, gets redirected to the ticket plugin which checks to make sure that there are tickets available, if true, shows a qr code the reader can send btc to as well as adjusts the amount if a discount code is entered, when the qr code gets btc, it reduces the tickets available by 1, and issues the a unique ticket code with qr to the purchaser (something I would be able to scan when they check in). 
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:54:09
You could buy from localbitcoins.com or find someone to sell to you. Depends on the amount you want to buy.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:54:59
You also need to verify an SSN and Id papers unlike PayPal(let's bank account to verification) or bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 03:05:16
regardless of the fiat it's based on, the main point of using BTC as a currency is to use it *independent* of fiat. If you base BTC on fiat, then BTC no longer is a currency, it's a stock. 
And actually my last purchase was purely in btc. I paid 10mBtc for a microSD card. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 01:18:26
Can't wait! Love to see more bitcoin stuff happen in Chicago
