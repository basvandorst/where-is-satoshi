The scenario you mention doesn't have anything specially to do with Bitcoin.  Any capital gain has to be reported.  Doesn't matter if it's a $20 pair of earrings, or a $20 painting, or whatever.
If you buy $20 of Bitcoin in 2017 and later in 2018 you sell it for $50 then you're going to have to report a $30 capital gain on your tax return.

"All over" is often used as a vague or approximate phrase.  Typically a vast area is sufficient to qualify.
For example, when I say I have traveled "all over" the US, I do not mean I have visited every square foot of space.

This house has no more to do with the inflation rate as a whole than  the drop in values of houses in Detroit ...
The value of the home I live in has followed the value of inflation closely since the '80s.
These are all empirical values, and they're irrelevant to the validity or invalidity of the CPI.
You're using the "it's cold outside today, global warming debunked!" argument.  Individual values are irrelevant to averages.  
That's not to say that you're either right or wrong.

It is being devalued for sure, but it's definitely not hyperinflation.
Hyperinflation is when a loaf of bread costs 1 dollar on Monday and 10,000 dollars on Friday.

Adjusted for the 121% of cumulative inflation since then, it should be ~$376,000.
However, improvements to the property, change in demand for beach front property, and the change in neighborhood can also make a drastic influence in price as well.
