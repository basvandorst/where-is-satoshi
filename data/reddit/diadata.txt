A sign of high tides to come?

Insurance against hacks and scams - what would prevent the Wallet owner from 'hacking' himself and claiming insurance money? The current Blockchain infrastructure makes it easy to do so.
Insurance against price volatility - Let's assume that 1 million insured people bought Bitcoin at 10,000€ and the price falls to 5,000€. How would the insurance company be able to pay 5,000 million€ without going bankrupt?

The ironic thing about this, is that because of Blockchain technology (i.e. mining) the carbon footprint of the world has increased significantly. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 10:32:56
This is nothing different then from the classic Western Union/Moneygram scam. 
You should avoid the Cryptocurrency scams the same one you avoid Moneygram/WU scams.

Nice prediction. Let's see if it becomes reality
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:22:46
0.1BTC is a popular 'scammer' ammount (at least on Telegram all the scammers offer exactly 0.1BTC).
Did he send you a link to coinbase? Is it the legitimate website or a spoof?
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:23:27
The beauty of such predictions is that 15 years from now, everyone will forget about this prediction.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:34:44
Schadenfreude? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:01:38
You know that you have a successful Cryptocurrency when over 51% of the mining power is controlled by one mining pool...
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:19:25
Does anyone have a more detailed analysis on this 'civil war'?
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:23:46
Put it in your Google Calendar so you won't forget, then :)
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:01:37
" **What will the status of bitcoin in upcoming year?** "
Step 1: Take out a magic 8 ball
Step 2: Shake
Step 3: Read the prediction.
If unsatisfied, repeat steps 2 &amp; 3

Thank you for the PSA.
Unfortunately, many new (and old) users still see exchanges as a viable way to store Cryptocurrency...
The safest way to store it is on a hardware wallet (or a paper wallet).
Happy trading!

12% of the population will lose money
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:37:31
I agree with you. It sucks that people downvoted your comment 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:03:53
Technically you don't own any Crypto on Revolut. 
As far as I know, there is no way to transfer BTC anywhere from Revolut.

You can always make a trade every month and convert what you need from your paycheck into Crypto.

Was there a time that twitter actually cared?
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:42:09
Think about it this way: 
Why would he just gift you 500$?
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:28:17
Definitely related with the Hash Wars

This statement would of made more sense half a decade ago.

I wonder when their plan will become reality....hopefully not soon!
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:31:51
I am pretty sure it was inspired by the Paris Commune and the protest of the 60s....the french have a history of making grand protests!\~

x4 growth in 18 months. Not bad!
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:17:10
Of course it can!
The real question would be: Will the price of Bitcoin continue to recover? And the answer: No one can possibly know
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:49:37
Next step: being able to pay with Bitcoin at almost any offline store :)
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:58:04
And now that the price has dropped: Buy and HODL even more :D
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:23:39
When 10 million?
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:54:49
It's not about the price - it's about the technology itself! 
The technology is good, so the 'lower' price is temporary 
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:12:03
I would be curious to see a map of all Bitcoin ATMs in the world. 
I know many maps exist, but there is no single map with all the ATMs on it (at least not one that I can find)
