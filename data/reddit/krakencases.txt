You do not know what you are talking about. I do not give a fuck what you think

How can you make a portrait of someone that no one but the NSA knows who it is?
This guy just happened to have that name.
Great job? Leave the fucking guy alone

You are. Who the fuck is protecting you with the constitution? Police follow the law which they underhandedly use to subvert the constitution while claiming they are upholding it. The constitution limits what laws can be enacted, it's not something you can use in your defense except in am appeals court which would be AFTER YOU ARE CHARGED, TRIED, CONVICTED, AND MID SENTENCE. The only ones working directly with the constitution is Congress. Congress is not going to wage any defense on your behalf. That's not how this country works.
You have no fucking clue what you are talking about

Yes, because that is factual and true. Im not going to sit here arguing with some disgusting edge lord who has no comprehension of real world enactment of case law, or what the constitution means in regards to your rights, or what the constitution means in regards to the laws in which you are policed by. Your intent does not matter when the police say why you did it. Fuck off and go rip up some money in front of a cop. No one cares what you think or what your half retarded comprehension thinks.

You. Are. A. Fucking. Idiot.
The justice system doesn't give a fuck what you claim your reasons are.

It is not at all protected by the first amendment.
