Never once doubted bitcoin and ill happily come back tomorrow to remind you of your wrong choice of victor. There’s a reason BCH will never have the bitcoin label and always be BCash, and that is because that’s all it is. 
Should get your dev team to start concentrating on what it could actually be, not what it wants to be.
All you have done is make the crooks richer

Large scale miners did not setup shop for the greater humanity or for you and me to make money.
If they spy an opportunity to make mass amounts of short term gains, which can be used to either line their own pockets or increase mining operations further, of course they will.
Don’t pretend you would not do the same, if someone told you prior to the BCH spike it was 100% going to be pumped that you wouldn’t have bought in.

It was not the miners who conjured up this plan, and I would say it was plan B with the original plan A of 2X fork failing.
The miners were clearly in on the plan, but not for the reason of replacing BTC. They were just in on it for the money. 
For Miners I can’t see how 1 chain is better than 2. Use profits to set up another set of equipment and mine both chains simultaneously. Otherwise they are just going to jump back and fore whatever makes the most money. 
As I said before, they don’t give a monkeys what chain lives and what chain dies. They want money. There is no bigger picture to them. 
I wasn’t saying you were wrong to call them hostile. They are.

If your bitcoin is held on the exchange then no, there will be no btc mining fee required to exchange btc for ltc, just the exchanges commission charge for the trade and then the ltc mining fee to send wherever you need to
