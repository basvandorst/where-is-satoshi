whats the best company to introduce someone to bitcoin payments with, I'm so rubbish at explaining bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:54:04
they jack up the prices so much it's cheaper to xe to cash and buy normally

we should have a sub reddit for pro bitcoin because sometimes I have a question or want advice on bitcoin and there is literally no point to post as trolls come 
it would be really nice to have a pro bitcoin sub so genuine interest can be explored 
there you go now you can start downrating me trolls

I think we are spoilt, imagine complaining about a bank wire not arriving after 4 hours :) she is just under a bit of pressure today, I'm all for a little more patience, it's not like we paid $20 to send the money in the first place, I do feel sorry for any bitcoin services though and hopefully we can learn from this and improve.

so it's like a hardware wallet on your phone and not a separate device like a Trezor?  I think that's a brilliant idea
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:15:50
I do yes but i also expect it to go to the moon after
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:36:22
