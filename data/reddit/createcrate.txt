Im not doing anything illegal. Why would it be a US company be bad? Does that mean coinbase is bad too?

What do you reckon is the worst case scenario if you continued to use Cavirtex?

same amount, but not same value.

that is a good point. however, we don't know what the technology will look like in the future.

Well, IMO Cavirtex wasn't very transparent with what happened. They said that there was a potential compromise, and that they wanted to shut down because of that.
In comes Coinsetter. Coinsetter said they fixed the problem, but didn't say what the problem was or how the fixed it or how they can ensure it won't be a problem in the future.

I talked to Greg at Cavirtex, and he said that withdrawals were reactivated on a account by account basis.

Bill Gates. Think about that shit for a minute. It had to buy some white dude with glasses with a strong background in computers and thinking and shit. But Gates is smart: he made a political manoeuvre when he decided to identify himself as a Japanese dude.
Bill Gates invented for Africa!

The CEO of coinsetter was quoted on coindesk.com about the acquisition of cavirtex, and he mentioned how they fixed the proble.. blah blah...
But, imo, he HAD to say that.
