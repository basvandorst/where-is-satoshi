Tor isn't great privacy.  You still have to trust someone, even if it's just the node/mixer you are using.  There are poison well attacks as well as Sybil vulnerabilities in such a scheme.  
  
Privacy must be baked in on a protocol level to be truly effective.

Considering that the NSA adds you to a special monitoring list if you download or express interest in Tor, there are a lot of good reasons not to.  
  
This is the danger of treating privacy as an add-on accessory, which is exactly what we did with the Internet.  
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:11:40
You will never know who holds the most Monero.  We have no Satoshi-like figure, because it's impossible to know the balance of any particular Monero address.  At the same time, the total number of coins in existence is still verifiable (unlike zcash) so you never have to worry about a coin generation bug festering undiscovered for years.  
  
However if you want to reveal your transactions, a viewkey is provided which allows others to see your balances without spending them.  
  
Bitcoin is public by default with optional privacy that can be added on.  
  
Monero is private by default with optional transparency that can be accessed.

Whenever block size or inherent untraceability topics come up on it is fair game for conversation that there is already a blockchain that has these issues solved.  
  
We don't need sidechains or controversial theoertical hardforks to achieve this.  It's already in the protocol.  
  
As far as me being a Monero super fan, try to imagine how insufferable the Bitcoin maximalists were in 2010/2011 when they realized a better form of money had truly been invented (banned all mention of it in fact).  Well, I'm sorry to say that with the advent of Monero a superior form of money has been invented.  
  
I'm not going to pretend that's not true, or sugar coat the reality to spare the feelings of fiat- and Bitcoin-maximalists.  No one need even take my word on it - you can verify the specifications yourself.  
  
So I'm sorry that you don't like the reality that an untraceable crypto with a flexible blocksize exists, but it does.  I don't spam other subreddits with it, nor do I insist on mentioning it where it's not relevant, but I'm not going to pretend it doesn't exist.  
  
What really is upsetting you?  That someone is excited about Monero?  Or that it's very existence threatens the maximalist value proposition of Bitcoin?  The good news is that a public ledger is a great complement to a private one, and Bitcoin is in no danger of being dethroned at the moment.

I've been waiting for you.  I'm just happy the Next-Level trolls have shown up; These really are exciting times.  People like you don't just mindlessly bash - you have specific technical qualms with the protocol and the knowledge to argue your position.  
  
If you are mistaken, then the truth will come out, the  community will learn something about the tech, and  belief in the asset is strengthened.  
  
If you are right, then specific weaknesses can be considered and worked on long before they become crippling.  
  
Either way, this is good for Monero. 
  
I made a topic on already about your excellent graphic.  If you would be so kind, can you post a link with the spreadsheets there?  
  
Also, you may be interested in knowing (or likely already know) about which is a fork of Monero with aims to make the tech mobile and pruning friendly.

I feel pretty certain they still have no idea wtf a blockchain is.    
  
What they *have* done is hire a bunch of programmers with a tenuous grasp of blockchains who have sold them on a fancy permissioned ledger, which will crumble to dust in a true adversarial environment.

It's not clear if they even fully understand what the concept of a blockchain is, which is worrying coming from IBM.  
  
Either they have just proposed: a.) a shared password-protected spreadsheet. or b.) an actual blockchain that is going to be wildly insecure due to no external financial incentive to protect it.  Sure IBM will want to protect it, but if they use proof-of-work they will have to worry constantly about bearing increasingly expensive security costs against a 51% and if it's proof-of-stake it again turns into a permissioned spreadsheet.  If it's some other centralized system, same thing.
  
They should just use Factom or something if they are worried about records, or wait for the inevitable and superior Cryptonote version.  With Factom I can rest assured that records are secured and immutable, backed by the strength of the Bitcoin network.

Whenever I hear someone refer to "blockchain" on its own, I cringe inside.  
  
You can have "a blockchain" or "blockchain technology" but just calling it a flat name like that is akin to saying "We here at Ford are getting very excited for automobile."  
  
I swear these firms have no damn clue.  Instead of scouting hard on BitcoinTalk and Reddit for some potential employees who might actually be able to explain why this stuff is gonna  them (and also how they can yet profit from it), they got Mike from speculative investments to spend a week looking over it and sent a few agents into try to understand how to make a crippled version of it while subverting the original.  
  
Disaster and failure all around on their part.  The damning thing is they could all become (stay) the Titans of the new monetary world that will emerge by investing in and cultivating promising new open-source, decentralized blockchain projects.  But they won't do this because it's a different sort of thinking from how they have traditionally made &amp; controlled money.

And yes, if the powers-that-be adopt cryptocurrency they will have their own ideas about which currency should win, and may conceivably have a multi-dimensional way of enforcing their desires.

When dealing with such a fusion of technology and belief, it's important to recognize both metrics at work: technological prowess and existing network effects.  
  
I have always maintained that Bitcoin will serve as the primary public ledger for the world, and even if a superior *private* ledger is created, there will always be a need for a large and reliable public one.

Sometimes it takes a few months to heal from it.  But now you've learned lessons and understand what it feels like to lose vast sums of money.  You have wisdom that others don't.  
  
Remember, play the long game because swing trading is gambling - plain and simple.  If you believe in an asset, buy buy buy and HODL.  
  
No margin, no leverage...  If it goes down and you still believe in it: buy more.  If it goes way up and it seems overhyped for now...  Consider lightening your load a little.  But no shorting; ultimately you got no clue and the bubble might continue.

Yeah,  it's funny how charts like this don't exist in the real-world...  But if price movements really were a random walk, like some idiots wants you to believe,  then at least occasionally this would happen.   
  
As is,  price moves according to psychology at large enough scales (greater than $50 billion market cap) ,  and the whims of a small circle of power players at smaller caps (less than $50 billion) which is then enhanced by herd mentality and group think.

It's important to show that you are the rational one in any given situation.  The idea of an organization manipulating anything is already considered 'conspiracy'  by the mainstream and this will make your job easier.  
  
When confronted with any accusations which you are unprepared to deal with,  simply levying the idea that the accuser is 'crazy' will work for you best.   Another way to do this for your more casual alts is to accuse the target of doing drugs.   
  
Above all its important to discredit anyone who attempts to expose the true nature of your disruption efforts.   Make them feel attacked and isolated,  and you will usually succeed in preventing most public relations challenges before they begin.   
  
In cases where the target is unaffected by your maneuvers however,  alternate methods should be employed,  such as ignoring the target and focusing on easier points of failure.   
  
Your goal is to create discord,  not to create a backlash against paid intervention in public relations.

You can have a system of rules for a decentralized system,  as long as no authority has final say on where the pieces end up.

Today bitcoin did something no other asset in the History of mankind has done.  
  
It began to wrap around and go backwards on the charts.   
  
Experts are baffled as to what this could mean,  but there can be no denying it.   Looking a bitcoin price chart from any source clearly shows the price line coming to a firm stop,  and then going back the other way.   This is actually changing the historic price,  which was higher just days ago.   
  
"Apparently there are quantum properties of bitcoin that are not fully understood," Eric Grant, Chief scientist at Bitcoin International said.   "The fact that this asset class can actually change its value through time in two dimensions unlocks possibilities that dollars and gold could only dream of."   
  
International criticism of the move has been swift,  with world leaders taking the stage to denounce the unprecedented price movement.   
  
"An asset that goes backwards in time and changes its value is essentially a two dimensional national security threat.   Bitcoin must be stopped. "  
  
The CEO of Mastercard also was quoted as saying, " We tried to warn the world but no one listened.   Now,  the end times have arrived.   Mastercard only ever worked one way,  our way.   Bitcoin can apparently travel through space and time.   Also,  merchant adoption is low while Mastercard is accepted worldwide. "  
  
For now,  supporters of bitcoin are baffled and frightened.  " It looks like the moving price graph is outlining the shape of a cat," said one noted holder who refused to be identified.   All over the Internet,  there is panic as bitcoin registers values lower in the past than it initially did,  forcing people to recalculate how much money they actually had at that point in time.   It also doesn't help that because the price graph went backwards,  the value of bitcoin is essentially undefined currently.  
  
"It's not zero, " said Eric Grant.  "It's basically undefined as it doesn't exist on the y-axis at this time.   It is just as accurate to say it's worth infinity."   
  
For now,  all bitcoin enthusiasts can do is hope that the price line turns once again towards the present and makes it way back so they can have some idea of how much their asset is worth.   In the meantime,  all they can do is watch as the price literally rewrites history and changes how much it was worth in the past.   
  
It's a complex world and we are all struggling to understand and come to grips with societies first two-dimensional asset class.

I usually store my private keys in my email accounts in true crypt containers that use a special password unique to that container.  That way,  even if my email account is compromised,  the private keys are not.   
  
As long as the true crypt container was generated on a clean machine,  can you find any holes in this method?   
  
The only possible leaks I can see are accidentally opening a truecrypt container on a machine that is keykogging you, if the original machine used to generate the container wasn't secure to begin with (solved by using a special offline machine to generate the truecrypt container) ,  or if you carelessly leave any copies of the private keys laying around (a threat with any security method).

Wait,  hold the phone.   Are you telling me Chase **closed** your account because you spent your money on bitcoins?   From Coinbase,  a reputable US Company?   
  
If so,  it seems that should be HUGE news.   The bank is not only telling you what you can and can't spend your money on,  it's outright shutting down your account (a huge hassle for most people)  just on account they don't personally agree with the things you're buying?   
  
I can't even fathom how this can be legal or possible!?   
  
This should be way bigger of a deal than it is.   What if Chase strikes an agreement with Samsung that all chase customers will only purchase Samsung televisions  and if you purchase another brand,  they close your account?   Because that's essentially what this is.   
  
And it is not ok.

Let me install a Changetip app on my phone that has access to WhatsApp,  and I can initiate requests through it to send tips and money to anyone of my contacts.   If they have a phone number associated with Changetip,  it automatically goes into their account and they are notified.   
  
If not,  they get a message via WhatsApp or SMS that I have sent them money and they need to either set up a Changetip account or provide a bitcoin address to deliver to.   
  
And there you go Changetip,  I just told you how to increase the value of your company by millions more dollars.   I believe in you.   Thanks for the hard work.

There exist people,  both paid and not,  who are only here to troll bitcoin.   Their goal is not rational discussion,  or even angry debate about the currency.   
  
No,  they only want to subvert and damage bitcoin as much as possible.   
  
To this end they submit endless negative stories,  downvote legitimate content,  and upvote each others stupidity.  They seek to sow fear,  doubt,  and uncertainty among people curious about bitcoin and new to the platform.   
  
Some of them work for PR firms,  some of them work for companies with interests that are opposed to bitcoin,  and some of them might even work for governments.   We don't know for sure.   
  
But we do know this: they don't care to rationally discuss bitcoin with you.   Nor do they care if you argue with them.   In fact,  if they can take your attention away from your main topic or destroy legitimate discussion they will do so.   They try to accomplish this in a number of ways,  ranging from personal insults to stating falsehoods and straw man arguments.   
  
Anything is better than you continuing positive and informed discussion.   
  
But don't fear.  **Legendary investor  americanpegasus,  lightbringer and trollslayer**, will show you how to respond to these clowns...  If you must.  
  
The best course of action is to usually downvote them and ignore them.   But if you must reply,  **simply restate your message,  and thank them for agreeing with you**.   Make sure they understand that their participation only serves to the further the bitcoin movement.  Restate their words in whatever form necessary to strengthen your argument.  Be polite and upbeat.   
  
Do not insult them.   
Do not argue with them.   
Simply treat everything they post as pro-bitcoin propaganda.  
  
**This kills the troll.**
  
Here's an example:  
   
  
Now,  if there is a user who legitimately wants to discuss bitcoin,  don't be a dick.   But if they seem unreasonably negative check their history for a pattern of trolling.   And if you see it,  the answer is simple.  
  
Troll the trolls.

A quick look at his user history shows that from the very beginning of his short history,  he has been bashing bitcoin left and right.   
  
He even mentions at one point that 40 bitcoins would be 'a lot'  to him.   Many other statements talk about what a bunch of 'bag holders'  bitcoin users are.  So why would he be holding bitcoins and transferring them in such a manner?   
  
Answer?   He's not.   He's a fucking troll,  and I have no idea why this has so many upvotes.  😑
  
This is an example of a 'soft troll',  a user who appears to be legitimate and is discussing a grievance,  but is actually just seeking to undermine the validity of the asset.

Instead of just responding on your primary account,  use one of your alternate accounts to accuse the target of being irrational.   
  
More screen names will appear that a consensus is building against the target.  He will be discredited and the idea that a paid agent could even exist in a community will be shunned.

I once read a book as a kid where a child wished to have all the money in the world.   
  
It was granted to him.   
  
Excited,  he looked at his titanic piles of trillions of dollars and grabbed a handful.   He immediately went to a local store and started buying all the most expensive toys.   
  
The shop owner was thrilled to have a customer,  seeing as how he just lost everything.   All the shops money had mysteriously vanished.   
  
The kid bought the toys and tried to return home,  but was interrupted by the store owner calling him a thief and demanding the toys back!   
  
"I don't understand," the boy said.   "I paid you."   
  
"You used some kind of trick money!" the shopkeeper accused.   "It disappeared the moment you left!"   
  
The boy was horrified and went back to his wish grantor to ask why this had happened.   
  
"Well," it told him.   "You asked for all the money in the world.   If you ever gave any of it away,  you wouldn't have all the money in the world anymore,  would you?   So I can't let you do that."

As you can see at    
  
-------------  
  
When in the course of cosmic evolution,   
new insight and development enable sentience   
to interact with the universe in more meaningful ways,  
It becomes necessary for that same sentience to reconsider  
the ultimate purpose of its existence, and to refocus its 
efforts  
towards fulfilling the same.  
   
Here, at the dawn of recorded history, we exist as a scattered,  
violent, and unorganized intelligence.  The same biological  
processes that have gradually bestowed self awareness have  
also instilled a fierce competition for resources within us.  
As well, we harbor a ferocious ego that demands to be validated,  
and this ego will damage or consume the prosperity of others  
in the pursuit of this goal.  These traits that once helped   
shape our species into a more noble version of itself are   
rapidly growing incompatible with our rising sphere of influence.   
   
Let these facts be submitted to a candid universe:   
   
An existence that consists of a constant state, whether it  
be an arbitrary value or nil, is not an existence worth salvaging or  
preserving.   
   
The universe that we reside in exists somewhere in between these  
two extremes, and has been growing into an increasingly complex  
value ever since its moment of genesis.   
   
The ability of the universe to regard itself rests solely in this  
complexity, otherwise the sentience that created this message,  
this technology, and the one that observes it are not possible.  
   
Therefore, in lieu of any other assigned purpose, we must pursue  
the advancement of what has brought us to our current precipice  
in our climb towards greater understanding.   
   
We must pursue complexity.   
   
This is the alpha, the current goal of sentience in the universe.   
All things that we know that are worth preserving arise from it,  
and the existence of this message and the one who observes it  
are both proof of the same.   
   
With increased complexity of universe,   
and the the shifting value it translates to,     
greater sentience will give rise to greater methods    
by which we can understand and manipulate our reality.    
This will ultimately   allow us to accomplish our implied duty    
to prevent our own destruction.     
   
It is clear that when a civilization reaches a certain point  
in its development, it must cross a critical threshold.  That  
threshhold is whether it can overcome the destructive variables   
and competitive values that drove it to its current level of  
advancement to begin with.   
   
If it does not overcome its own nature, it is doomed to either   
consume itself in competition or stagnate until a greater process   
annihilates it.  
   
We hold true to the belief that this instance of sentience is   
one that shall endure.  We will take whatever steps necessary to   
ensure the survival and continued growth of our strand of awareness,  
with the ultimate goal of joining and contributing to the grand   
awareness of the universe itself.   
   
To this end, we hold the following principals true:   
   
The blockchain offers our civilization an unprecented opportunity  
to both decentralize power among competing entities and also to  
store, in perpetuity, the knowledge and history of our ascention.  
   
Due to the crucial importance of this protocol, it is of a vital  
nature that access to the blockchain remain unobstructed and   
available to any member of civilization sentient enough to seek  
access to it.   
   
We, therefore, the users and participants of the blockchain,   
do solemly publish and declare that this shared record and the methods  
that grant access to it are, and of right ought to be free and   
independant.  They are absolved from ownership or control  
by any entity or entities.  None shall restrict or hinder access to them.  
No government, corporation, or persons shall have governance or power   
over it, unless granted by the internal consensus of the network itself.     
Whatever value or significance the blockchain represents shall be  
determined by the users alone, and no entity shall obstruct that   
freedom.   
   
And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the   
belief that sentient complexity shall endure and succeed, we mutually  
pledge our Faith, Fortunes, and sacred Honor.

The engine changed transportation,  and the Internet transformed communication.   Now Bitcoin is redefining the very concept of money.  
  
A network that cannot be shut down or owned holds a limited number of 'coins'.   Users verify the history of every coin constantly and create new ones by solving math problems.  Coins don't belong to people,  but instead to anonymous addresses.  By broadcasting their intentions to move coins to a new address,  people 'spend'  their bitcoins.  
  
A combination of a precious commodity (like gold),  a spendable currency (like dollars),  and a speculative investment (like stocks),  Bitcoins are the future of money.

There is something incredibly powerful about decentralization,  and we are learning more all the time.   
   
The human body is wired to perceive centralization,  so we assume that's how things work best,  but reality continues to prove otherwise.   
  
Take particle physics,  the ultimate example.   Each particle is an independent system that reacts based on the inputs from other particles.   There is no central authority.  
  
Or what about insect colonies,  which are masters of decentralization.  A single ant is worthless,  but together they become something mighty.   
  
When artificial intelligence really hits a home run,  it will also be decentralized programming and technology that create it.   Why?   Because ultimately you are decentralized too.   You are a trillion cells,  and billions of neurons.   Each neuron is a simple thing on its on,  but when you out them together...  It becomes a *you*.   
  
What other industries and staples of humanity will be revolutionized by decentralization?
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:45:26
So you're telling me if you had hundreds of billions invested in a certain system of doing things,  and a rival upstart threatened you,  and you knew it was powered by the positive opinions of the masses....  And those masses gathered at a few central social hubs....  You wouldn't spend ANY $$$ hiring people to try to sway public opinion?   
  
Because that doesn't make sense.   And furthermore,  we know for a fact that companies and governments have been doing it for years.

It is naive.   
  
Do you think the most powerful people on Earth are inbred retards?   No, they control money,  power, and everything in between.  These are people who have one small branch of their machine able to infect half the world with a secret malware,  and that was 5 years ago.   Who knows what is possible today.   
  
You can either believe that it started when private individuals literally bought the US Government in the early 1900's or you can believe that it was going on long before then.   
  
Regardless,  rest assured that they are well aware of the threat that bitcoin poses,  and also understand that it likely can't be stopped at this point.  ⚠🅰
  
Therefore,  they have decided/are in the process of enacting Plan B.  Plan B is to control as much bitcoin as possible before it becomes the new standard.  🔯🅱
  
It won't be a problem if the American markets collapse in favor of bitcoin so as long as America also controls an astounding number of bitcoins.  
  
But time is short, and they have to start gathering as many as possible,  as cheaply as possible.   Conferences like the one in Dubai show that other nations are becoming aware of this asset and therefore time is critical.  🕒

-----------  
  
Ultimately,  isn't it nice to believe that we have masters in control of our destiny?   Isn't it comforting to believe that intelligent and wise overlords charts our path?   The idea of the universe having a God is comforting.   The idea of our world and nations having intelligent and capable leaders is comforting.   When our public leaders create doubt in us about their abilities,  we are even inclined to invent new ones.  
  
It's infinitely more terrifying to think that the universe has no master,  just like mold growing on an old piece of fruit has no master.   And humans are not wired to believe that their government,  or any system in which they place a large amount of faith,  could possibly just be an illusion that rises from a collection of entities,  each possessing incredible power and wealth,  and each engaged in a poker game of global proportions.  
  
The games are always the same,  it's only the magnitude of the stakes that change.  The wise are able to see the illusion for what it is.

These new technologies may solve some of the issues that companies such as Zynga have,  where they want to process hundreds of thousands of transactions a day and not pay a small fee for each of them, even the low fees bitcoin charges (which would reasonably add up over a an amount like a million microtransactions).  
  
David is a natural and strong public speaker,  and so many people want to ask him questions about bitcoin and possibilities.   He's currently fielding questions on decentralization around the world,  and how mainstream adoption will happen (hint: it's when people find a relevant use for the Tech...  When did *you* start caring about the Internet?).   Unless you are a tech enthusiast or investor,  you probably don't care about something until it is relevant to your interests.

This was requested to be focused in a tech savvy audience.   For a non tech savvy audience,  I usually emphasize that bitcoin is basically a record of every coin that is constantly updated and shared between all users.  I gave an example of this in response to another in this comment.   
  
I'm a natural salesman,  and it's great practice seeing if I can get the average twenty-something party girl to understand and appreciate what bitcoin is.   
  
If you can do that,  you win.  
  
A product needs to be three things to succeed:  
- Simple (not yet,  but we're working on that)   
- Shiny (we just need a few celebrities to endorse bitcoin and the plebs will fall in line)   
- Make people feel important (the most crucial part of all!)

This is indeed a blow to bitcoin,  but will only slow it's ascent slightly.

Next year major retailers will begin to detail plans to deal in bitcoin and a couple of years after that we will be in the midst of another exponential move.   This decision is a nasty and cheap shot by HSBC which will do nothing to stop their competitor.

It would be the next mega bubble. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:50:23
So no,  $10k bitcoins are not coming next year,  and if they do you should seriously consider selling into that bubble.  
  
It's much more likely we get a sharp bubble that is kicked off by a wave of publicity in the spring,  and we will see the price rise to new highs ($1500 to $2000) before collapsing back to sub-$1000 in the fall, and then steadily (Or quickly) climbing back up towards $2000 as the year winds to a close.  We have never ended a year with bitcoin at its true price though.  Most years it was below value, but 2013's black Swan bubble made bitcoin soar to unsustainable prices that were way above its true value.  
  
So we either end 2015 with bitcoin at around $1300 (in which case we are gearing up for the next bubble) or at $4000 (with a nasty shock in for the beginning of 2016).  
  
We reach $10,000 sometime around 2018.  
  
We reach $1 million dollars sometime around 2026.  
  
This chart ( shows why I believe bitcoins are a stupidly good value right now.   They are undervalued by about 50%... A game theory pricing error that will quickly resolve in 2015.  
  
Hold onto ya butts.

Whenever I consider a speculative investment, I like to apply the 16-year old girl test to it.  
  
**"Could a normal American 16-18 year old girl possibly want this product?"**  
  
The answer for the iPhone was a resounding yes, and look what happened to Apple.  
  
Same thing for fashion brands, such as Michael Kors.  
  
And now, if there's any hope for this common denomination to ever 'want' a cryptocurrency it's dogecoin.  
  
I think this demographic is interesting, as most people constantly underestimate just how tech savvy they are, but constantly overestimate just how cognizant they are of the greater 'adult' world.

Presentation  Getting ready for 'fireside'  chat with Eric Voorhees.   Fire is suspiciously absent,  leading to conspiracy theories about finally exposing the pyramid scheme for what it is.   
  
  
  
Bruce is detailing how our friend Ken couldn't make it,  unfortunately due to government restrictions.   
  
First things discussed are 'Why is Bitcoin not a Ponzi scheme?'   😄
  
  
  
Basically,  items that are a Ponzi scheme have no value.  You can demonstrate that bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme simply through the fact that you can transfer value with it,  right now,  today.  
  
He discusses gold and the gold standard and how bitcoin compares to gold in many ways, including that such precious metals aren't backed by anything either.   
  
The conference is doing a good job of mixing bleeding edge developments with information for new people.  
  
Finishing addressing the Ken tweets,  Eric discusses the complaint that 'you can't buy anything with it'.   Laughs around the room as Bruce jokes about a 'little company named Microsoft' which just started accepting bitcoin yesterday.   
  
Now on to more pleasant things?   I'm sure Bruce is relieved not to have to play bad guy anymore.  He's not very good at it; won't be casting him anytime soon.  
  
A discussion is happening about how this is still very early,  regardless of previous exponential increases.   
  
Eric has begun discussing Coinapult,  and how it can/will help solve the issue of the volatility in bitcoin.  He mentions the concepts of 'locks'  and how if you lock in $1000 in value of bitcoin with a lock with Coinapult,  you are owed $1000 in bitcoin regardless of future value fluctuations.  Personal opinion?   For fiat sucker who aren't fully convinced yet.  If you believe in bitcoin enough to accept it fully,  you understand the deflationary nature of it and despite short term loss possibilities,  you would never want to 'lock in' a dollar value of bitcoin considering the inflationary nature of the dollar.   However,  a juicy business idea and a profitable one.  
  
Eric is bringing up fantastic points about how even if you don't necessarily hold a libertarian viewpoint,  you have to accept that the widespread adoption of bitcoin will cause a decoupling of currency from government.  He compares it to when church and state were separated,  which was a very difficult struggle at the time, but it would be hard to find someone today who disagree that wasn't a good idea.  
  
It was a joke three years ago about Microsoft accepting bitcoin.  Now it's a reality.   And it only took three years.   
  
Those countries that ban a new technology don't stop the new technology,  they just handicap their own population.  Look at what has happened when countries have banned or censored the Internet.  
  
It would be amazing if America would benefit in a large way from the bitcoin boom,  but if they continue to try to overregulate they will lose as businesses move elsewhere.   Dubai and the UAE could end up being a hub of the new financial world if they embrace bitcoin.  
  
Eric is saying that bitcoin is a very binary outcome.   Either it will go to the '🌚 moon'   or to zero.  The reason we go through bubbles is because the world is trying to figure out which one is true.  
  
Eric is discussing trolls now,  and why a troll transforms into one.   It has something to do with magical moon power...  Not really.   Made that up.  
  
"When I first heard about bitcoin,  I laughed at it and thought it was stupid. "

Today's Buttcoin trolls are tomorrow's bitcoin users.

I got news for you,  Kentucky boy.   The world is a lot bigger than I-95.  
  
Muslims control a vast amount of wealth (power) in this world,  and because of the tolerant and moderate attitude taken in places like Dubai, they are rapidly growing into a center for investing, culture,  and business.  
  
How many people are desperately immigrating to your daddy's barn to be part of the wave of the future that's taking place there?   Probably not many.  
  
So take your SJW,  soul sister  shit somewhere else.   It's their culture and I'm not here to preach about how things should be,  according to my personal, religious, and moral beliefs.  Their history and religion is a lot older than mine and your 1980's and 1990's philosophy that is formed partially in response to opinions of Final Fantasy Fucking 7.    
  
Islamic law,  culture,  and life is simply how things are around here.   Sharia law is a reality and it's easy to preach from under your Dorito dust about how you think the world should be.  It's a lot harder to get your ass up,  actually visit the entire world and understand things from their point of view,  and then start trying to make a positive change that benefits everyone,  regardless of previous beliefs.   
  
Bitcoin is that positive change.  And all it asks is that you believe in math,  which as it turns out,  is a pretty simple decision.   
  
And it's a perfect fit for the Islamic banking system.

@_date: 2014-12-14 06:50:39
Let me think about this.   Ok, follow me, follow me.  
  
The entire point of a decentralized system is that no one mandates any particular values.  This is how brains, physics, and bitcoin work.  Each value is pliable and reliant on other values to determine it's state.  
  
Problems occur when you try to mandate values from outside of the system, though some genesis values seem to be necessary.  This gives rise to the nature of the system (properties of neurons, 10-minute blocktimes, etc.).  
  
So the nature of the value can't be centralized.  If it is, it's an incomplete solution.  It needs to be a fluid value.... but maybe not?  I mean 10-minute block times aren't a fluid value, and they work.  Hell, that's how we even proposed to determine the resolution date on the contract...  
  
I think the difference is that the core value is encoded into the protocol, rather than coming from outside.  So hard values and centralization are ok in such objects, as long as they don't come from external sources (points of failure).  
  
Ok, I'm gonna go eat a Chicken Tikka Roll and think about this.

Anyone reading this should know that the above poster is a paid troll who works for an astroturfing company to discredit bitcoin online.  
  
He knows that bitcoin will be successful just based of the amount of companies that are paying users to discredit and attack it.  
  
He doesn't actually believe the things he says,  and you can bet he is stashing as many of his shillings as he can into bitcoin because he knows what the future is too.   
  
Unfortunately because the policy of the mods in this subreddit is not to delete and ban known trolls,  users like this are allowed to spout their nonsense,  but you should be aware that this is not the views and opinions of a real person,  but a sock puppet account,  paid to say these things.

Look at that wonderful thing,  a product of exponential golden ratio beauty.  It's a festival miracle.   🎄
  
Do you see what I see?   I hope so.   Because it's about to get *amaaaaaaazing*.   
  
Let's start with the moving weighted average line,  that was calculated with 100 periods.   For you chart novices,  that's the line that moves through the main chart on top and seems to dip and dance through the data.   
  
What happens,  time and time again?   We see the crash,  right?   Then what?   I'll tell you: the pattern is clear.   
  
The weighted moving average dips below the horizon for a time,  leaps above it,  then falls down,  *but only touches itself* and **that is the evening of the next bubble**.   Check this pattern,  and how it repeats itself throughout bitcoin history.  
  
And now look at present day.   That's right,  we are looking at the perfect conditions for a mathematical apocalypse.  Up...  Down....  Back up....  A gentle touch...  And **MAGIC** is coming soon.   That's right peoples: it's gonna be the bitcoin big bang.   Numbers fucking numbers,  bedlam in the streets,  a counterhash supernova.  It's going *down*.   
  
--------  
  
And what about the RSI chart beneath?   I'm glad you asked.  
  
That chart shows us when the bottom is in for a particular movement of the bitcoin cycle.  Whenever the RSI has dropped below 30, that has been the bottom (Or damn close to it)  of that particular bitcoin fibonacci cycle.  
  
And again,  what do we see?   BAM,  we have *already hit that* in this cycle.   Game over man.  🎮 The bottom is in,  and has been in.   
  
------  
  
And how will we know when the next bubble will pop?   Easy peazy mother nigga.   Just check yo Williams R and shit.   
  
That dude knows what is **up**.   😎
  
Every time we were about to collapse he sent us warning signs,  big red flashes in the upper atmosphere that told the whole world what was about to go down.   🔜
  
And he'll be there again for the next roller coaster.   Listen to him this time.

Why did Mastercard post a professional video attacking bitcoin?  
  
If bitcoin becomes a currency standard,  for the first time in history people will have an alternative to dollars and gold (that is superior in many ways).   A lot of powerful people won't be powerful people anymore because they have built their entire lives around the mastery of fiat based economics.  
  
The gatekeepers of anything don't like to be upstaged... Did the entertainment industry politely accept the freedom of information the Internet provided?

Back in 1995, this guy was hoarding domain names when others thought it was stupid... and now he's moneybin rich.  Your argument status: **shut the fuck down**  
  
----------------------  
  
*...Rick Schwartz. A college dropout, he was a traveling salesman who had been working on commission selling furniture for 15 years when he got the idea in 1995 to start registering what might be politely referred to as adult domain names, such as slut.com, porno.com and ass.com, which get a lot of type-in traffic. All these addresses go to what in Internet lingo is called a parking page – a web landing with links to advertising targeted at the kind of people who would search for these terms on the web. Google gets paid each time people click on these other sites, and Schwartz gets a cut of their revenues. “I was able to go into the porn industry without ever having a dirty picture,” says Schwartz, 60. Investing in domain names “gave me a way to get off the road.”*  
  
*Folks like Schwartz may own tens or hundreds or thousands of them (he owns 6,000). The easiest and most low-risk way to get into this market is to create a domain name, pay the nominal fee to register it, and hope that someday someone will want to buy it. All Internet domain names are run through the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (known as ICANN). After that, they are managed by companies called registrars – there are hundreds of them, including such popular ones as Go Daddy, register.com and Network Solutions. They will give you the exclusive right to use the domain name for a certain period of time (typically one or two years), after which you can renew it.*  
  
*But the real money – and what’s paid for Schwartz’s five mortgage-free homes and seven cars – is the sale of a domain name for a figure that includes many zeros. Schwartz has done 20 such transactions during the past 18 years. Some have involved domain names for which he was the initial registrant; others were domain names that he bought on the aftermarket.*  
  
*Among his triumphs: He bought candy.com in 2005 for $100,000 and sold it in 2009 for $3 million, putting it No. 19 on Wikipedia’s list of the top 20 highest prices paid for domain names. Most recently he sold eBet.com, a domain name which he paid $100 to register in 1996. Its sale, on Oct. 16 for $1.35 million, makes it No. 4 on DN Journal’s list of the top 100 domain sales for 2013. No. 1 on the list, which wasn’t one of his, was IG.com, which fetched $4.7 million.*

Stocks entitle you to a share of a profitable business... listen to your words, despite the fact they are regurgitated nonsense you haven't really pondered.  
  
What is a profitable business?  A successful business, one that will continue to produce and grow.  One that people believe in.  And how do they generate 'profits'?  Through money, the profits are transacted in instruments of faith as well.  
  
Their value is **absolutely** based on faith.  Why was Netflix $50 one year and $400 the next?  Did their situation really change that drastically?  No, but the people's **faith** in them did.  
  
It's the same reason why Apple has climbed so hard recently.  People have increased faith that Apple will continue to dominate the market and why my darling 3D Printing has fallen so hard: people lost faith in their ability to dominate the market.  
  
Look at Angie's List.  It's a 400 million dollar company (market cap through stock price) that has never made money, and has in fact lost money since inception in 1996.  Why does their stock have any value at all?  Because some idiot out there has **faith** that this company will one day be profitable.  
  
So while you are busy shouting like a pleb, you're just embarrassing yourself in front of the world.  You don't actually understand what money is yet.  
  
Keep learning.

I'm not in college anymore and I'm not taking a fucking quiz,  but for fun the last thing you mentioned was a classic example of the travelling salesman problem,  which is the gold standard for explaining NP-complete vs NP-incomplete problems.   Basically it refers to how long an algorithm will take to derive an answer with increasing numbers of inputs.   
  
We obviously want something constant,  ideally,  but even a linear increase is OK.   
  
Functions and algorithms that take exponentially longer or factorially longer are not ok,  and it is theorized that many problems cannot be solved with traditional computers in a timely fashion,  such as travelling salesman,  which is one reason we are interested in quantum computers.   
  
Also,  go fuck yourself.

The world's not ready for a healthy alt coin market yet,  but I honestly think Dogecoins have a comeback in them.  
  
In any case, I think bitcoin is a good place to be for the foreseeable future.  There are a lot of challenges already facing it and it doesn't make sense to fracture our efforts just yet.

When I was 17 back in 1995 I tried telling all the adults of the day what would be popular when *I* was an adult, but they wouldn't listen.  
  
*"No, you don't understand!  The music of the future will be like rap mixed with techno.  It's going to change everything!"*  
  
*"That's nonsense.  No one wants to hear computers make music.  Instruments are the future.  Now get off AOL so I can make a phone call.  Stupid teenagers."*  
  
Now that I'm an adult, I'm not going to make the same mistake my parents made.  When I speculate about what will be popular 10 years from now, I look to the 15 to 17 year olds for guidance.  Their insane silliness can be quite enlightening sometimes.

Expectations of future profitability *in a companion instrument of faith*,  the dollar.   
  
Basically a stock is a derivative of this faith.  Will this brand continue to generate additional faith in themselves?   That's the real question investors are asking,  ultimately.   
  
Think about this.   In a non dividend paying stock,  you down own *anything*.   You own a piece of paper with the companies name on it.   It's essentially currency minted in the name of a company,  given weight based on the reputation and profitability of that company.

This isn't the way to do a bitcoin board game anyway.  The premise is flawed here.  
  
A good game has three features:  
- A resource (Or resources) that players compete for and use to win.   
- A way to grow more powerful over time through skilled use of resource investments.   
- Systems in place to ensure that the game isn't determined entirely by chance,  but rather,  strategic maneuvering and bluffing.  
  
A real bitcoin game would need all these,  plus the resource (coins) would have to start out nearly worthless at the beginning of the game.   Then,  every time a player circled the board,  it would increase in value by a random amount (Or sometimes might lose value,  or even crash).   However,  the probabilities would be structured so that it's more likely that it gains value vs losing it.   For example,  roll two dice.   Any dice roll but a seven or two increases the buying power of all coins.   A seven will cause it to decrease,  and a two (snake eyes)  will cause a crash.   
  
Also,  the board would have limited property to buy that can generate new coins and force others to pay you.  
  
Then it all needs to be balanced.  
  
The game becomes a risky battle of waiting for your coins to rise in value so you can buy more property with them vs,  risking your opponents getting the jump on you buy buying property **now** and potentially leaving you behind.   Should you save your coins?   Or spend them this turn?   They will probably be more valuable next turn...  Unless your opponent buys all the spaces and you have nothing to spend them on...  Or the dreaded **crash** happens.   
  
Also random cards can invoke special events,  like government regulation and exchange fraud.   
  
There you go.   Bitcoin the board game.   
  
You're welcome.

So to date,  'Satoshi'  hasn't pulled any bitcoins from his primary stash,  is that right?   And how many coins are there?   
  
Can you imagine the vision necessary to invent this  and watch your dragons horde of imaginary things go to $1000 a coin,  and not cash out even a single one?   
  
Do you know what the end game is?   Someone this smart has an end game.  
  
Once bitcoin is established,  and standard,  and that dragon's horde is worth a gargantuan fortune,  the likes of which may have never been seen...   
  
It will be time.   
  
What could be done with $100 billion spent towards a charity of your choice?  What about $500 billion?  What could you fix if you had the equivalent of an entire year of American defense spending?   
  
We might be watching the greatest story of charity ever told.  Or maybe even charity is too small for what Satoshi is thinking.  
  
Even the most ludicrous spenders would never need more than a billion dollars to live the rest of their life in Paradise.   When bitcoin becomes the standard,  I can promise you we will see something that will redefine the word epic,  something unprecedented in human history.

In a cacophony of angry voices,  no useful positive consensus can be found.   This should be accomplished by any means necessary.

Every time I have blown up,  it has only been to demonstrate and provide a caricature of what is really happening.   Do you really think a million men can manage their finances better than one americanpegasus?   They didn't in 2008.  
  
They took all of their wives savings and destroyed it on speculative junk investments.   
  
And they're going to do it again, except this time it will make 2008 look like a dimple on the road before a cliff.   
  
**Do you know why throughout history the markets have followed an exponential price curve?**  
  
It's not just inflation.   It's also that human progress and the advancement of civilization can't be denied.   No matter how hard those in charge crashed the financial system into the ground, it always bounced back because: hey,  there's no where else to go,  niggas gotta make dat bread,  and people don't suddenly stop creating and producing just because some numbers on a paper or computer changed.   
  
But now it's different.   Humans will continue to create and work after the next one...  And human growth will still be exponential,  but it won't be what you expected.   
  
We all saw Moore's law and projected 8 terahertz processors,  but that didn't happen did it?  No,  the advancement took another form.   
  
So will this.

I think that Monero does a lot of things that bitcoin fundamentally can't/shouldn't.  
  
First of all, it's inflationary, which is good for a spending currency.  It is also naturally private without any need to transact in the bitcoin network to begin with.  I don't need to have any record of having received digital currency if I choose not to.  
  
Sidechains are going to be great for a lot of things, but not necessarily for serving as a global private ledger.  I really think Monero is headed for big things, but it's not my intention to spam this board with my Monero beliefs.

As I wrote on The kicker is that his fortune was made in stocks,  which are no different than dollars,  gold,  or bitcoins.   He is a fool who doesn't understand money,  and by his own advice,  he should stay away from it because of this.   
  
All money,  including the stocks that Buffet loves,  are merely instruments based on faith in *something*.   Dollars have value because of faith in a government.   Stock has value because of faith in a company.  Gold has value because of faith in scarcity.   
  
So what if you could own truckloads of gold before the rest of humans realized it was scarce and valuable?   You had better.   
  
Bitcoin is building a shared ledger via a technological revolution.  When the rest of humanity realizes how valuable owning a slice of that ledger is,  it will explode.   
  
And Buffet will sit in his crochety money bank and snort.  
  
Thing is,  he made his billions by recognizing something valuable before others did.   The means he used to create his fortune wouldn't (and don't)  work for individual investors anymore because everyone has access to obscene amounts of data and any change in that data is instantly reflected in price.

Final maturity will come when the bitcoin network has no more value left to consume.  
  
It started with the fringe crypto-geeks and ballooned outward, consuming tier after tier of society.  Right now it is nibbling at Wall Street and will soon engulf it.  Once that's done, the only place left for it to go is to the governments themselves, consuming the value of their money supply and becoming the foundation of world finance.  
  
If bitcoin had a level above that to eat, that offered the same greed to fuel it, it would.  But that is going to be its current final maturity: the new world reserve currency, and the metric by which all other money measures itself by.

They said they were looking for an explanation geared toward tech savvy people that were new to bitcoin.  
  
For a common person, not tech savvy, I would have gone with (and do go with):  
  
Bitcoin is basically a record of of every coin,  how it was created,  and how it has moved between owners.  Coins are created when computers solve really hard math problems,  and the coins have whatever value people think they do.  You can buy,  sell,  and trade them just like any other money.

Metcalfe was correct that the value of a network grows much faster than the sum of its parts.

This is naive silliness.  
  
It is human nature to seize power.  The government we have restricts our freedoms in certain ways, but it also prevents charismatic madmen from seizing power and inflicting dictator level suffering on those around them.  
  
The creator keeps yelling about freedom, but does not discuss the rational alternatives to modern Democratic government.  
  
Out government isn't perfect, but it keeps the wheels of progress spinning.  If you are an anarchist who would do away with government, you have not seriously considered the implications of what you are suggesting.   
  
It is only through the stability that modern governments provide that things like the Internet and bitcoin are even possible.  You cannot just 'do away' with government, as a dictator will inevitably rise in its place.  
  
You either have to brilliantly create a way to fully decentralize government, or you have to govern with an imperfect system that is trying it's best.

Consider two fringe fantasy cases if you want to envision the time value of a network.  
  
Exhibit A. is a network that (for whatever reason) the vast majority of humanity adopts almost instantly after its creation.  Ignore why this would realistically happen; just pretend it did.  
  
Now, how much would the value of that network change vs. One that had grown organically to slowly engulf that same amount of users?  
  
I would agree that there is a definite age-value to a network, but it may not be what you expect.  
  
Let's consider Exhibit B, on the opposite end of the spectrum though.  It is a network that stagnated at 10,000 users yeaaaaars ago, like a social network that didn't take off but people still use.   
  
Which is more valuable, the network that slooooowly acquires that 10k users and has age or one that nearly *instantly* acquires those 10k users and whose future is unknown?  
  
As our can see, the **faster** a network grows, the more valuable it is.  This is because we naturally extrapolate that growth towards the future (whether or not we are correct in our estimations).  Facebook got to one billion users very quickly, so investors assumed that Facebook would probably have about 65 billion active users soon.  😉  
  
I would say bitcoin's rapid growth after emerging from nothing is a strong contender of why it is probably astronomically more valuable than any other money on Earth, and will continue to be so.

We have seen four major bitcoin price movements since birth, each conveniently forming self-similar fractal patterns.  
  
As well, conditions for mass adoption are looking more and more likely (if not overwhelming).  
  
We know bitcoin cannot function as it's intended function without having a titanic market cap.  Even Satoshi said it will either die or become enormous.  
  
We also know that if bitcoin falls, crypto as a trusted platform of monetary exchange falls  (the original blockchain must retain value or else why value any blockchain if they are all flashes in the pan?)   
  
We also know that human psychology prevents the formation of smooth and rational price increases.  
  
So, all these things and more considered, it is silly *not* to predict a massive bubble on the horizon.  
  
I'm sorry that I'm right, but I am.  If I had said that bitcoin was going to $1,000 back in 2011, you would have called me irresponsible and spreading foolishness...  But I would have been right.  
  
And now, in 2015, I am telling you that bitcoin is going to have another colossal price movement upward, and it's irresponsible not to assume that this will happen...  *since that is how it has always happened*.
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:28:35
Your mistake is believing it's possible to determine an intrinsic value of *anything* because ALL value is subjective.  
  
Ask yourself this: what would happen to the stock market if we discovered that a planet killer asteroid was unavoidably going to destroy Earth in 2 years?  
  
Money doesn't actually exist.  It's all a confidence game.  
  
And the reason you are having trouble figuring out an 'intrinsic' value for bitcoin is because it's value is either nothing or astronomical... and almost nothing in between.  
  
We are in the final stages of the price curve lagging behind the technological potential, and after the next bubble, it will become difficult/unreasonable to own 'an entire bitcoin'.  
  
Seriously, take 1 to 2% of your holdings and convert them slowly over the next few months to bitcoin/monero/crypto.  If I'm wrong, the greatest genius of our time cost you 1%.  If I'm right, I just gave you a headstart to avoid the lemming rush from the rest of the financially elite (inept).  
  
The eventual dominion of crypto must be plausibly deniable, so you will see the fiscally conservative curse it and avoid it all the way to the bitter end, but eventually even they will have to succumb.

Wow, I didn't even think about it like that.  
  
But how can we be sure that the complex part of x and y isn't on the *same* complex axis?  
  
How can we prove that x and y have their own independent complex dimensions?  
  
If they are independent, that would mean that the system I'm looking for might take the shape of a quarterion, with the signifcant result being a lower dimension object.   
  
For example, when we plot x^2 = x + 1 we get two lines and the **interesting part** is where they plots intersect *only for x*.  
  
And the 1 is critical because without it, x^2 = x returns boring and predictable results.  
  
A lot of this is examining exactly *what* these algebraic statements are claiming and not just accepting that 1 equals 1.   
  
So, it's possible we don't even need to grasp the entire object to get a meaningful result although it will help.  After all, when you think of phi, you don't intrinsically think "that's where the parabola and the straight line meet if you shift the straight line over by one.  But it's still true.  
  
I'm just wondering if this result will also incorporate the fibonacci sequence somehow or if the sequence will be different in higher dimensions.  
  
Basically what I need to do is write down a list of ways that phi is significant and then list the qualities that the higher dimensions equivalent *should* have.   
  
For example, the x = a/b thing from my previous post.  A higher dimensions golden 'curve' should satisfy a curve where x, y can both be expressed using a sequence of the fibonacci numbers.  
  
This is an exciting time to be involved with mathematics.  But to make progress we can't simply 'learn' and accept things as they are; we have to question and strive to understand *everything*.

No no, see my other reply.  3 is my basis for a while new number system, instead of 2.  Possibly 5.  
  
Also, I now agree with you that x and y in complex form must have their own axiseses barring artificial and arbitrary manipulation.  So that's neat to discover.  
  
And I need to read more before I can grasp your explanation, but I suspect that since a quarternion is the complex-complex form of an x or y, that's why it's not fair to say that a mere complex and y is a quarternion (even though they are both four dimensional).  
  
Thanks for your professional contributions to golden curve theory.  I am seeing several forms of 'phi' related numbers in my mathematical excursions, including various positives and negatives of the square root of 5 and 1, but you can't deny in higher dimensional forms the square root of seven **also** starts showing up.  
  
This implies to me that it is intrinsicly linked to the golden 'solution' one dimension up.   
  
--------  
  
Fun fact, I searched forever on Google trying to find a simple polynomial formula for a diagonal ellipse, and gave up.   
  
I was quite surprised to find it by accident in y^2 + x^2 = xy+1  
  
I am thinking that if there *is* a higher dimensions golden shape, it won't be something simple like a circle because a circle doesn't reveal much information.  Like the odd geometric properties of the one/two dimensional phi, the two/four dimensional golden geometry will be nonstandard.

Good for him.  Great answer.  
  
I add to that by saying that bitcoin is only different from a database because the tokens on the network carry financial value.  
  
If JP Morgan created its own blockchain, it would start with some inherent value, because they are a major company after all.  But people would not value it as highly as the already robust bitcoin network, and as a result JP Morgan would struggle to secure the network and it would be doomed to fail as the value of the tokens plummeted.  
  
Without people believing in the value of your network, out of pure blind faith, bitcoin does not work.  That's the crazy magic of it: *we have invented clever bullshit, and because we are all going to pretend it has value, amazing things are going to be possible.*  
  
Now admittedly, that value has emerged over a period of years and is justified, but the point is the same: "We all agreed that these magic rocks are valuable, so they are."

Most of are prepared to weather the emotion of loss.  That's what we expected coming into these risky investments.  
  
But I'll bet few are ready to weather the shock of suddenly having more money than they've had in their entire life.  
  
That's what will happen to Monero during its first huge bubble, and what will happen to bitcoin during the next bubble too.  
  
The only thing is, during the next **bitcoin** bubble it won't be *individuals* who are so surprised to have such newfound wealth, but companies and funds who look at their balance sheet and say, "This risky new asset just returned us 5000%?  SELL you fool!"  
  
And that's how we crash from $XX,000 a bitcoin back down to $X,000.
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:46:21
We have begun to notice that bitcoins price had resembled a fractal pattern through the different magnitudes of price.  
  
At the risk of seeing patterns where there are none, it's pretty apparent that we have had a few different cycles of the same thing: massive price spike, crash, stabilization, slow rise, repeat.  
  
I would say that since bitcoin has done this repeatedly since birth, the surprise would be if it suddenly began to deviate now, not if it kept doing the same thing.

A stock in a company does not represent that company's value *as is*.  It represents the investors belief in the company's *future* value.  
  
Bitcoin, as the master ledger of our species, will come to represent our species.  So it is naive to think that the value of bitcoin will only be the rational value of all "money" on Earth.  
  
In fact, the total value of bitcoin will drastically exceed the rational money supply, similar to how a stock price greatly exceeds the tangible value of a company's assets.   
  
A few million dollars is not the maximum possible value of a single bitcoin.  Emotional creatures driven by greed may speculate that value much higher, and irrational crowd psychology can drive it higher still.  
  
It's possible that humans may come to temporarily value a single bitcoin in the **hundreds of millions of dollars** *long* before such valuations make sense.  This would likely end with a cataclysmic crash down to more reasonable valuations, just like what happens with many stock prices.

Oh wow, amazing.  +9000 Pegasus  
  
It's always nice to have a vision and see that others have already explored it and mapped it out.  I always hated math in school because it was "this is the formula -  apply it to get the answer" and I could never learn anything because I kept insisting that I know **why** before I moved on to the next concept.   
  
As a result, when factoring in Algebra 2 went over my head (why are we factoring this? 'because we are'), I just kind of checked out.  Trig and calculus blew me away and I failed high school calculus.  I had to take it again twice more in college just to pass, and then faked my way through calc 2 and calc 3 ("*three dimensional integrals? Fuck it- I'll go be a stripper*") before hitting a hard wall around linear algebra (though statistics and probability was awesome and simple).  
  
Seriously, public school can go fuck itself.  A year learning the "whys" of math would have probably caused me not to get utterly lost later on.  
  
So you can see why I might have a disdain for formal education.   
  
OK, now I have some learning to do via reading up on these three axis numbers, an academic introduction to cryptography, and contemplating two/four dimension golden geometry.

You clearly haven't travelled the world much.  Once you have actually seen the world from more than just an LCD monitor, you will realize that it's far more complex than just doing away with government and giving everyone a puppy.  
  
Do you believe that humans are naturally benevolent and loving towards each other?  Well you are wrong.  
  
There exist a wide spectrum of humans, and some of them are benevolent and positive, but some of them are destructive and selfish, and many of them don't give a shit.  They don't mind being cogs in a machine.

For example,  to get yourself a pyramid made,  you had to have some long term centralization.  It made sense.   
  
But centralization of religion lead to conflicts that weren't productive for society.  So we decentralized religion,  and humanity was better for it.   
  
It also coincided with the rise of the corporation,  a decentralization of a company.   
  
He has spent some time talking about amazing it is that people have quot their jobs and now make a living from mining and handling the generation of an entirely new and made-up form of money.   
  
Honesty is subversive,  and it's interesting how corporations and centralization work.   They live and thrive by paying you less than what you are worth,  and need secrets to function.   
  
Open source and decentralization encourages honesty and it is extremely difficult to lie in such a truly decentralized system.  
  
Now we bring up auditors.  In a centralized economy,  you need auditors to verify honesty and transactions,  but they have to be centrally authorized.   Why?   Because the act of auditing in a centralized system exposes the system to danger from the auditor.  Bitcoin doesn't need that.   It is open and easily audited by anyone around the world.

Which is why it's important that we delicately, tactfully, and with plausible deniability let other friendly nations have a piece of the pie too.  
  
It's also why the US has to limit the coins it retains to the original Satoshi stash, because there is a percentage value (though I'm not sure of its exact number) that is the perfect amount of coins to keep vs. 'give away' in such a game to ensure your maximum wealth once the 'digital lifeform' reaches maximum permeation.  
  
You can fully expect that if/when bitcoin consumes global finance, a Satoshi patsy will bail-out the United States Government like the Rockefeller family did in the early 20th century.

This is fucking retarded.  
  
Obviously Satoshi is the code name for the NSA division who collaborated with John Nash to launch bitcoin into the wild.  
  
Those initial coins are held deep in an underground fortress and you better believe their existence and status are some of the most highly classified information in existence.  
  
Once bitcoin does become the reserve currency of the world, those coins will miraculously be recovered by the United States and will become the new foundation for the US Dollar.  
  
John Nash is a hero on a scale of magnitude that most of us can't even comprehend and it's likely that he (and the geniuses who collaborated with him) will never be given proper credit for literally saving the United States, preserving the first world, bringing a measure of true equality to our civilization, and preventing a total global financial meltdown.  
  
It's a god damn shame that most people's memory of John Nash will be a fantasy about Russell Crowe talking to some imaginary Irish guy and trying to solve nonexistent ciphers in Cosmo.  
  
The man deserves a proper fucking biography, and I hope to one day have the creative resources to create it.

Biff is pissed off,  and says 'Screw you guys,  I'm choosing the Sports Almanac universe'  but because no one gives a shit what Biff thinks he just ends up living there alone...  Until he finally gives in and come and lives in the 'real 1985' (as decided by majority consensus).

Then you should feel honored to be the recipient of its second coming.  
  
The things I post on Reddit are so valuable they should probably be behind a paywall, but like "Satoshi" I too am giving the world my genius for free.  
  
And for your information, I am on the bleeding edge of a new class of dimensional analysis for polynomials and operations.  One that may reframe mathematics forever.  
  
I'll give you a sneak preview: phi is lauded as the golden point where multiplication and addition meet.  
  
But what about where exponents and multiplication meet?  
  
Euler's identity uses i, an imaginary number, to transform a simple one-dimensional curve into a two-dimensional shape that wraps back around to a specific **zero** dimensional point (which is - 1, and exists on its one-dimensional real number line).   
  
So, wouldn't you theorize there is an identity that allows a two dimensional plane to "wrap around" complex space (possibly a quarterion grid) and connect back to a specific one-dimensional line?  
  
This line would be the 'golden curve' and would be as significant to mathematics and cryptography as phi is.  
  
Consider the ramifications of the following sequence, and how each operation represents a particular dimension:  
1  
x    
x*x  
x^x  
  
I'm on the verge of some incredible things.  I can't wait to share them.

Two different ways to skin a cat.  
  
Not everything that is scarce is valuable, and not everything that is useful is valuable.  
  
Even combining these two qualities doesn't guarantee a standard of value.  
  
The core game at play (whether people rationalize it to this level or not)  is whether the next man will accept this item as currency.  This is why I'm saying 'faith' because you have faith that other people will continue to value the currency as much as you do.   
  
In bitcoins case,  that faith isn't based off the country or company that bitcoin represents.   
  
So why does bitcoin have value then, over any number of other alt coins (some of which are arguably superior)?  
  
This might be the argument that trolls use to scare small children if they've never stopped to realize that money is a house of Cards.   Truth is though that money is a strong house of Cards.   
  
The reason why humans agree to use a certain thing as a standard of global value are complex,  and I think bitcoins rise is due to the technology as well as the position of being the oldest and most respected ledger.  
  
Just as there are other valuable metals,  but yet we still pay heed to gold as the grandaddy of them all.

Hal Finney was more than a bitcoin pioneer.   He was also a noted cryonicist.   
  
He had the foresight to sign up for cryopreservation with Alcor and is now frozen in liquid nitrogen.   
  
I am also signed up for the same.   
  
It might sound strange and futuristic,  but hey,  so does bitcoin.   And if you freeze yourself, there is a non-zero chance that you may still exist in a thousand years.   It's small,  but still non-zero.   That's the power of preserving yourself.   
  
If you let your body rot in the ground or be burnt to ash,  your brain is lost and that chance becomes absolute zero.  
  
So if you have ever wanted a scientific chance at immortality,  and the best current opportunity we have,  check out Alcor and consider being preserved in liquid nitrogen after death.  With life insurance it's more affordable than you might think.

OK, fine, but I had suspected that we had defined the next operator up from exponents.  That wasn't the primary concept I was exploring.  
  
What I'm going to do is demonstrate a new and more powerful way to express those concepts, and maybe discover a few profundities while there.  
  
Hmmm... And so it follows there is a tetra-root or a hyper-root operation?  Interesting.  
  
I actually thought I was onto something with the following thinking earlier, but Wolfram raised an eyebrow and spit out something above my ability level.  
  
I thought, with addition and 'x' we were able to construct an equation "x + 3 = 0" that had no current solution and forced us to create negative numbers to explain it.  
  
Then multiplication and 'x' allowed us to create an equation for which no answer exists *using our result from previously*.  So we said "x times x = - 1" and this made no sense, so we had to invent a new type of number to deal with the result.  Thus 'i' was born.  
  
So, it follows that *using our previous result*, we should be able to construct an equation using exponents that has no answer and forces us into a new type of number.  I fed "**x^x = - i**" and out popped a crazy fucking answer that dealt with e and pi and some shit about a Lambert W-function (or omega) which is currently outside my mathematical bounds to grasp.  
  
So more research into this result is necessary and introspection about possible profound polynomials.   
  
And I think I know how the fibonacci sequence would have to work in order to form a golden curve... It would have to deal with *complex* fibonacci numbers.  
  
As well, this should also chart a plane that slices through 3D fibonacci blocks stacked in a (up, right, down, out, left, in) configuration.  
  
So there's more research and learning to do, as always.

I met her in person at the Dubai Bitcoin Conference, found her well-spoken, and her company's presentation solid.  I also gave her some valuable advice:  
  
Stop comparing your product to your international competitors and saying, 'We are just as good as anyone else.'  
  
No, you are *better* than anyone else.  Take your small differential features and magnify them.  Exalt and amplify what you do differently.  You're 'toasted', remember?  
  
BitOasis should not just be an adequate Middle Eastern Bitcoin company - they need to be the pioneering champions that will act as the gateway to let the wealthy of that region *stay* wealthy as the world moves into a new age of digital money.  They need to offer service and security that is better than anyone on Earth can get, and UAE residents get first chance at it.

Rational players attacking a game.  
  
A rational participant will speculate and buy a bitcoin if he believes that others will eventually value that coin higher than the other players.  
  
To make that decision he will look at all the circumstances surrounding bitcoin.  
  
At a certain point the infastructure of bitcoin itself will be worth more than the marketcap and it will make no sense not to buy them.  With current infastructure, do you really think a market cap of $1 million dollars for bitcoins make sense?  
  
No, of course not.  
  
So it will never go that low.

The people behind bitcoin don't care who gets rich off it.  
  
People who see through the smoke and mirrors will become insanely wealthy, and the sheep who listen to negative opinions won't.  
  
Bitcoin will succeed despite negative opinions because it's too perfect of a solution not to.  And if a simple negative consensus could bring it down, it wasn't a very good solution to begin with.  
  
In fact, it makes sense to actively stress test it with negative opinions and constant attacks to ensure that it is resilient enough to fulfill it's ultimate purpose.

Hey,  something you said struck me...  You mentioned that for Amazon you need to have someone that trusts both you and Amazon to process payment,  but bitcoin would handle that...  Vs. A bookstore where the transaction happens immediately so trust isn't needed.  
  
Well now I'm thinking about shipping.   
  
**Is there a theoretical,  decentralized solution for shipping a physical product to someone so trust is not needed?**  
  
Look,  I'm just brain storming here.   But here's a problem:  I want to sell you my laptop.   You have money for it. (think ebay).   We now have a trust problem.   
  
What if I ship you a busted laptop,  and you've already paid?  No good.   What if I ship you a good laptop and you don't pay me?  Also bad.   
  
So one solution is to use a type of escrow to verify the quantity and payment before moving the items along to the final parties.  Another system is what eBay uses,  which is a reputational trust based system.   
  
It suddenly occurred to me that there should exist a theoretical (even if not practical)  way for two people to exchange goods and payment without trusting each other...  Though I can't fathom how that would work.   
  
I should be able to buy a physical good (we'll say an Xbox) from ProbablyScam.com with the user name Probably_Thief and there should be a way that the website and I both can arrive at a satisfactory purchase without us needing to trust each other in any way,  and without needing a third party escrow/reputation either... Hmm...  But maybe the nature of the problem is flawed because a third party shipping is already needed.   
  
Any ideas? 
@_date: 2015-01-12 09:10:04
I disagree.   I have been monitoring the sub for months and any critical bitcoin piece posted *immediately* gets 3 or 4 upvotes.   That would not happen in a subreddit that wasn't infested with trolls.

I don't believe the average member of the population is ready for direct democracy, nor is it a preferable form of government.  
  
Look at the most successful system in the known universe, the human body.  Is that a direct democracy?  No.  
  
Individual cells have different functions and capacities, and all report and abide by neural cells.  And the cells of the arm aren't perturbed by this, they enjoy their existence just fine, and wouldn't want the stress of the brain's responsibilities anyway.  
  
Human beings are born with a spectrum of abilities and dispositions.  The common man does not have the education or desire to govern himself.  
  
Are you American by chance?  Have you met many Americans?  I have.  To participate in direct democracy, they would need to be informed on a range of issues, and be inclined to vote on them.  
  
It's easy for you and me to say that this would work: we represent the top 1% of our species (though that's not saying much...  The difference in abilities between the top 1% and top 0.001% is exponential).  However, Nancy Robinson  or Jimbo Walker?  Those people don't want to vote directly for laws, nor would you want them to.  They want to watch the latest Walking Dead and eat Doritos Tacos.   
  
Mass media already swings and controls the opinions of the common class enough as is, can you imagine if the masses were left to govern themselves?  The hive mind is a dangerous thing when every node has an equal say, but not equal enlightenment.  
  
Now, don't get me wrong.  I believe in an even playing field, and bitcoin will help bring that about.  If a poor Nepalese youth is talented, intelligent, and ambitious, there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to one day join the world's elite.  
  
But the man who can't maintain his bodyweight, just wants to get high all day, and doesn't contribute anything towards society?  No, I don't want him helping craft the legal system.  
  
This is why the founding fathers decided on a representative democracy, so that the enlightened few could rule the uninformed majority.  
  
I still believe in that system, even if it has grown some kinks and defects over time.  We need to incorporate more brain power and less lineage into the ruling class, but the original ideal isn't broken.

It takes a slightly malfunctioning mind to see what others cannot.   
  
It takes a mountain of intelligence to tame the beast of mathematics.  
  
And it takes a raw courage to trek through the unexplored, forging ahead through the woods while others lounge in the open field.  
  
We are very lucky, as a civilization, that John Nash was all of these, and born just as humanity's technological development went exponential.  
  
The loss to humanity today is difficult to express properly, but it is most assuredly vast.  It is not an overstatement to say that without John Nash many of our lives would be very different right now.  His contributions to the world simply would not have been possible by anyone else.  
  
Instead of focusing on a senseless death, we should instead focus on a long and cherished life, filled with a loving partner, and the peaks of accomplishments that most of us can only dream of.  
  
And from this moment, we need to understand and take with us the realization that our global family has a void in it now.  There was a time in history when only deaths in your immediate family affected you profoundly: mother, father, sibling.    
  
Great humans passed away and left a horrific gap in the mesh that bound your group.  This is no different, just a difference in magnitude.  
  
Coincidentally, as a result of some of John Nash's work, the Internet has expanded our definition of 'family' and 'tribe'.  A father is not longer a single male that grew up in the same household with you.  Indeed, we are *all* family now as a result of the unprecedented power of the Internet.  
  
And we have lost a father.   
  
We can only cherish his memory, and realize what all sons have been forced to reckon with throughout history: when the father passes away, the time for childhood is over.   
  
The family must go on, and someone must step into his shoes.  
  
So we speak with loving respect for his body of work, because like all good fathers, his memory will be cherished in invincible and revered tones.  At the same time, we sling the tools of his craft over our back and vow to do our best to carry on in his absence.  
  
Though the task seems impossible, we must still forge on ahead through the dark forest ahead.  One or more of us will inevitably ascend the same stairs of progress that John Nash graced, and perhaps the world will weep at our deaths as well.   
  
The time has come for the sons of mathematics to step into the shoes of the father.  They deserve their moment to mourn, but their primary duty is to keep the family moving through the difficulties and challenges ahead.  
  
We owe you an impossible debt John Nash, and though we cannot ever repay you, we promise to pay it forward to the next generation.

One of the girls needed to figure something out for her math homework, and through their giggling was asking to borrow someone's calculator.  (it was the nineties, we didn't have cell phones)   
  
"Does anyone have one I can borrow? ... Well, except Katherine.  Hers is like a damn computer."  
  
They all giggled, and Katherine recoiled in horror at the disapproval of her friends.   Her TI-82 might as well have been literal dog shit at that moment.

Oh wow,  it's Sam Carlson.   You've done some work for me for Pegasus Coin.  
  
You're amazing my friend.  
  
My ultimate goal?   American Pegasus Publishing is a company where people that want to create certain works of art, fiction, etc can provide whatever creative input they want and we will source the rest.  
  
If you want to draw some pictures and have a story written around them, we can do that, and will edit it too.   
  
Want us to create an entire novel based off your idea?   Or even a video game (one day)?  We can do that too.  
  
Custom projects.   And familiarity and support of digital currency as well.   
  
People these days have so many ideas but don't have the time to see them through.   Many of them, though, have the money to pay to have them created.   
  
So that's the idea I'm toying with.   I hope one day I'll be able to contract some work out to you.

No one needs an umbrella until it rains.  Human aggression is not some artifical trait.  It has been going on for eons, and with our current technological progress we cannot afford to let everyone have cataclysmic opportunities for power.  Without our military, the next power mad dictator will seize his opportunity and roll over the idiot utopian anarchists.  We *need* government, whether you like it or not.  
  
I am surprised you saw as much as you did in the Marines and didn't realize that lust for power is not an American concept; it is worldwide in various flavors.   
  
Immature idealists dream of doing away with the system and...  Well, that's all they have because they don't actually have anything better to replace it with.  
  
The intelligent and wise realize that true change must happen from within, even if it won't always be pleasant.  Bitcoin will be incorporated by the 'ruling class' and it will force them to be more honest, and it will improve the lives of the 'cattle', but we're not going to rise to some fantasy utopia as a result of it.  
  
The only thing that will stop unchecked human aggression is being slaves to an artificial intelligence singularity, which will be arguably better/worse.

You're not going to like the answer.  
  
You first announce that Bitcoin has privacy flaws that prevent it from being true e-cash.  It makes a great public ledger, but due to problems like this, it cannot ever serve exclusively as digital money. Then you say that you have decided to support a Cryptonote based currency **as well**, such as Monero or Aeon.  
  
You could have already quietly bought up a lion's share of these two while no one was looking, and you honestly wouldn't even need to move or sell a single Bitcoin if you didn't want to.  Of course if you *did* announce you were moving over x% of your holdings, you would crash the market temporarily (but would gain a much larger share of the new anonymous currency).  
  
Anyway, moving Bitcoins seems unnecessary.  Even the power of a message signed via Satoshi's PGP key would be strong enough to send one of those aforementioned currencies skyrocketing.  
  
At this point you can trade or sell your Cryptonote based coins for the Tesla you want, and there is a large chance no one would ever know about it.

I have lost about $500 in the past couple of months on my bitcoins,  it's true.  
  
But you know what?   Lol.   
  
I once lost $8000 in an hour on some penny stock scam.   You think loses in the three digits even phase me anymore?   
  
But more than that,  it's the principle.  My attitude would be the same even if my losses were six digits.   Because I have learned to see through the fear.   I now understand what it means to really buy the blood in the street.   
  
This is the lessons that losing money will teach you.  It will instruct you in the art of managing your own emotions,  even to the point of ridiculing them.   If your thesis was valid at $600 a coin,  it's even more valid at $200 a coin... Unless you never believed in what you were buying in the first place and were trying to ride some 'greater fool uptrend'.   
  
Not me.

I had not, thank you.  I will read it carefully.  
  
In the meantime, I scanned it and saw a chart which does mention Cryptonote.  However they don't seem to properly account for Cryptonote plus CT.  
  
This is the combo I argue will be superior to Zerocash.  Perhaps with more study I will discover applications which are uniquely suited to a totally opaque blockchain, but I cannot think of a situation where the lack of ability to even verify the integrity of the blockchain is an advantage.  
  
Properly mixed and scrambled data is sufficient and a great trade off with auditability.  However should a fair Zerocash blockchain be implemented, I will certainly be interested in it and possibly support it too.  
  
My allegiance lies to the future of cryptography and cryptocurrency - not necessarily to any specific implementation.  I am with CN + CT because it seems to be the best to me right now, and I can think of two glaring flaws in Zerocash (mentioned earlier).  
  
I think perhaps the future can support multiple blockchains of various opacity and privacy, and perhaps we will even need them.

Seriously, that both y and x can both have complex solutions for some kind of crazy four-dimensional root interaction is blowing me away.  
  
This is also why 3-dimension based math doesn't work...  Though in my next project I am going to propose a system of math that doesn't have 2-axiseses, but is based in 3-axises instead.  
  
I am wondering if some of our transcendental and irrational numbers will change form in such a system.  
  
I am realizing it has a lot to do with color math as I research.  For example, numbers no longer lie in a 'positive' or 'negative' side of an x = 0 point.  
  
Instead, numbers have one of three charges: red, blue, or green.  These colors take the place of traditional +/- signs.  The "axis" resembles a circle with three equal segments.  
  
Such a number system has a very close relationship with circles so I am wondering if it won't be a far superior number system to describe circles with, with out traditional number system being the superior way to describe squares.  
  
Of course, this will mean that the *complex* plane in this 3-way color number system will be in the shape of a double sided cone.... Though some of the geometry is blowing my mind at the moment.  
  
I'm wondering about the parallels to current color combining that artists do.  
  
Oh wow...  And perhaps it means that every **prime** number has an entirely complete number system it can describe!   Wow....  Like 4 dimensions is just a derivation of our current 2-D number system...  But using the sieve, we can find that 5 should also have a complete number system based around it.

I respect his achievements in the field, which are significant.  Nevertheless, his motives for criticizing bitcoin and the community must be unfortunately called into question when he has a competing commercial product that aims to replace it.  I say this with a heavy grain of salt since has been thankfully tolerant about promoting all kinds of blockchain alternatives lately, including the Cryptonote projects I am personally interested and involved  in.  
  
Nevertheless, I have heard that Zooko plans to launch his blockchain with a devmine/premine and I question why someone with as much experience and wisdom in this field as Zooko would do that, just as much as I question why Nick Szabo has gone full-americanpegasus for something with a distribution/mining-scheme as inherently flawed as Ethereum.  
  
I do think we (as a civilization) need to be launching a zerocash blockchain, and relentlessly attacking it for weaknesses while experimenting with it - there are some scary possible flaws in the Zerocash foundation and this new cryptographic structure needs to be vetted.  I merely hope that Zooko will realize the hypocrisy and absurdity of launching with any sort of commercial add-ons.

There is only one other crypto which has a clean proof-of-work history with no ICO/IPO, *and* expands upon Bitcoin in several important ways: **flexible blocksize limit**, protocol level address privacy, smooth emission curve, and untraceable transactions built in.

Bitcoin is an amazing way for them to preserve/hedge their wealth and get a jump start on the rest of the planet.  
  
I've been recommending all my UAE friends look into your company and I wish you the best success going forward.  I still predict the Burj Ola will be built around 2025.  
  
When you have some free time, also look into my newest cryptocurrency interest: Monero.  
  
It's open source, decentralized, and as ahead of its time as Bitcoin was in 2010.  Nevertheless, even though it came out last year, now is the time to start learning about Cryptonote.  Monero is the largest and most advanced implementation of it; this new standard adds protocol layer privacy and anonymity (once confidential transactions are incorporated) and also solves many other problems (flexible block size means there will never be scaling issues, and a fixed perpetual emission means there will always be new Monero to mine).  
  
Bitcoin may well become the dominant public financial network for the world, but we will still need a private one.  I think we may finally have it.  
  
Best wishes to your company and UAE's future.

It just kills you that I'm buying cheap coins and you can't stop me, huh?  
  
I can't wait for them to rise.  
  
In the meantime, let me refute these real quick:  
  
1. *Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement.*  
  
Nope, I never win so it seems that I always have between $2,000 and $10,000 to play with.  So the amount stays the same.  Next?  
  
2. *Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.*  
  
I don't attempt to cut down or stop.  So this is invalid.  
  
3. *Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.*  
  
Haven't made a single attempt.  Next?  
  
4. *Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble).*  
  
I usually forget my past experiences, so no.  And I don't have to think about ways to get money to invest.  It just happens because I'm amazing at life.  
  
5. *Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed).*  
  
Nah, I only invest when I'm manic.  
  
6. *After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing” one’s losses).*  
  
So in other words, you should only allow yourself to fail once, and then you should stop forever?  Man, fuck that Abraham Lincoln guy.  Sure, I'm not a quitter.  I keep getting up.  
  
Isn't there a song like that?  
  
7. *Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.*  
  
Nigga please.  Have you seen my public posting history?  
  
8. *Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling.*  
  
I lost a significant relationship because I divorced my abusive leech of an ex wife.  But it was my decision.  Other than that, no.  I have gotten repeatedly promoted these past years at work.  My personal projects are growing stronger than ever.   
  
9. *Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling.*  
  
I loathe borrowing money.  And my finances are fine, thanks.  
  
So.... 1 / 10?  
  
Try again troll.  I'm invincible, bitch.

Irreversible transactions are the hard part.  That actually makes Bitcoin legitimate money.  
  
You can build a layer of reversibility on top of Bitcoin, but without the permanent and irreversible nature of the protocol, the structure isn't sound.  
  
If the banks are actually building in permissioned reversibility into R3, it is going to be downright laughable and they are wasting their time and money.  *They already have a better version of that.*

I agree that religion provided a type of social responsibility and immortality that led generations to make good decisions.  
  
This is also why religion-less individuals were shunned, because in the God-fearing man's mind there was no other major reason to make sacrifices for the species.  
  
But I think in the past 500 years we have begun to wake up from the threat of a God, and realize the extent and limits of true collective altruism.  
  
For example, as an effective atheist, I would still not wreck havok and damage on my fellow man because I respect the social contract of humanity: do unto others as you would have done unto you, which funny enough was the distillation of Christ's message (that, and no man should stand between you and God).  
  
So in many ways, being an altruistic atheist is just about one of the most "Christian" things that one can be.  
  
And though I would not rob and rape in my last year, you can bet I would be wasting a fortune on the most wild &amp; exotic sexual experiences a human can have, while enjoying the best food and luxury a human can.  Might as well go out on top.  
  
In the meantime, as far as I know, I still have plenty of time.  So I need to make some contributions to our civilization, and pace the exotic sex experiences out a little.  
  
You need to remember and realize, there *is no* absolute good and evil, even though that is terrifying.  
  
After spending a year in Arab culture, even thier notions of good and evil are very subtly twisted from what we consider normal.  (no, they are definitely not 'just like us').   That doesn't mean that we are better, but only that morality is relative.  
  
The morality of the ancient Greeks would have shocked you, and yours would have shocked them.  
  
Religion and culture evolve, and an immortal being must be willing to change endlessly to adapt to new cultures.  **That** is the secret to immortality: a skeptical, but open mind, and the willingness to change with the times.

@_date: 2016-01-12 23:16:27
I hear you, but I have yet to receive a satisfactory answer to the following issue: if we do not increase the blocksize or keep it small, a fee market will develop at the network's current size.  If we increase the blocksize, a potentially larger network may grow - at the expense of damaging the current fee market.  Bitcoin **needs** a fee market to eventually emerge though, due to design.  When is the appropriate time to stop increasing blocksize?  
  
As well, the policy of continually trying to manually increase the blocksize seems flawed.  A permanent solution is needed if you want infinite scalability, but then you will also have to institute a minimum block reward to continually incentivize miners.  
  
Bottom line: Bitcoin needs a fee market to emerge, and space in blocks must be scarce for this to happen.  If miners don't have something substantial to compete for, they will not mine.  How can we continue to incentivize miners if we do not start building a fee market?  
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:26:57
The can should be kicked down the road slowly and carefully.  Too fast or too slowly and the network will suffer.  The rate at which we should kick the can is also dependent on growth and should not be a slave to some predetermined schedule.  
  
Unfortunately this means some centralization as *someone* needs to lead the charge of raising it when the time comes, as well as deciding when the right time is.  
  
I personally do not necessarily think that 50 cent or even 50 dollar transaction fees are a bad thing if the Bitcoin network is large and mature enough.  
  
The promise of worldwide digital cash can be accomplished by another blockchain with more nimble technology, which Bitcoin has gotten too mature to implement.  But a large and secure public ledger will always be needed, so we can't give up on properly managing Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:23:30
Not true.  Eventually the block reward will trend to zero and transaction fees will be the primary mining reward.  Therefore transaction fees need to be enough to incentivize mining or the network will weaken due to lack of interest.  Transaction fees will only be significant if there is competition to get into blocks.  Of course, a premature limit on block sizes will stifle the growth of the network and also hurt mining.  
  
Therefore the can should be kicked down the road.... But slowly and carefully.

You ~~can't~~ shouldn't build an anonymity layer on top of a public layer.  That's layering complexity, and even if it worked as good as Cryptonote (which there is no indication it ever will) it introduces all sorts of mischief as Ethereum has demonstrated.  
  
Also you are waving a magical wand of tech that doesn't exist yet and isn't even planned and assuming it will become incorporated before anything better becomes popularized.  
  
Finally, I'm glad we agree that inherent privacy is superior, but I would argue that a flexible blocksize is inherently superior too considering the cyber-war regarding blocksize increases I saw on this subreddit last year.

I do plan to hold some Bitcoin on the side.  I counsel you to hold some Monero on the side as well, and Dogecoin too.  Bitcoin will need a flexible blocksize to be futureproofed, and it can't do that without a perpetual tail emission.... which it lacks.  
  
But guess what does have it?  That's right - Dogecoin and Monero.  
  
Never forget all the Metcalfe networks that have fallen in the past due to superior technology and will continue to fall in the future: there used to be quite the system of horse related industry in this nation... now not so much.

@_date: 2016-06-29 03:00:37
We've discussed this Mr. Ver.  Any blocksize increase is just kicking the can down the road.  Only an adaptable blocksize fixes this issue for good and you need a perpetual tail emission to make that feasible.  Bitcoin does not have a perpetual tail emission and never will (without breaking the social contract).  
  
Bitcoin is Bitcoin - digital gold.  It will never be the end-all-be-all digital cash that some are hoping for and it's silly to try to force it to be something it's clearly not suited for.  
  
It is a large and slow public ledger.  Our civilization will need several blockchains by the time it's said and done, so stop beating Bitcoin up for what it's not and instead celebrate what it *is*.  
  
If you want a flexible blocksize there is a different blockchain that already has that.
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:03:31
What if there were a superior technology that were too radical to incorporate into Bitcoin?  
  
What if there were a blockchain with elastic and scalable block sizes, but it requires a small perpetual tail emission (which bitcoin can never have)?  What if there were a blockchain with improved cryptography underlying the whole thing which gave total anonymity and privacy while using it (as opposed to Bitcoin's pseudo-anonymity)?  What if there were a blockchain that never had a halving, but instead slowly declined the blockreward until it reached the aforementioned minimum?  
  
This features are undoubtedly superior to Bitcoin, and are too radical for Bitcoin to ever incorporate at this point.  Clever engineering can only build on top of a system, and there's only so much you can do when the underlying technology of an asset needs a complete overhaul.  
  
The thing about being an early adopter is that yes - everyone wants to be one.  But the actual early adopters see value where others ignore and mock it.  They think ahead of the game, like the Bitcoin folk were doing in 2009.  They don't accept the common-sense solution because they are too busy pioneering their own radical solution which defies everything that has come up until this point.  
  
Some were early adopters in the US Federal Reserve Note, and they will likely accuse others of chasing this 'tech gold' halfway to ruin.  Its hard to see the truth when you are blinded by your own bottom line.
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:43:04

When you rely on privacy tools on top of a public architecture, it makes anyone who investigates those privacy tools 'suspicious':   
  


  
Can Satoshi spend his coins without anyone knowing they've moved?  Until that answer is yes, you hardly have anything remotely close to perfect anonymity.  
  


  
The JoinMarket is inferior to protocol anonymity but sure - its a 'pretty good' solution to Bitcoin privacy.  As always though, you can be labelled as suspicious for seeking out its services.  
  


  
I agree - you need to get it right the first time.  And its because of this inertia that Bitcoin will eventually fall to a superior blockchain for majority use.

Briefly, but I refuse to argue with you about this as it's been done to death.  
  
Ethereum on its own is an unworkable mess.  I believe that a programmable token must exist as the second layer on an established financial asset like Bitcoin or Monero.  To make it it's own fundamental asset, and worse denominate control through proof-of-stake is just laughably bad mathematics and strategy.  One could almost make the case that Ethereum is purposefully cucked as a test bed for these eventual programmable tokens that will emerge as second layers in coming years.  
  
And that's before we even get to the absolute madness that is Vitalik leading the charge to *manually change* ownership of tokens in a "code is law" environment.  
  
Anyone who continues to own Ethereum deserves to lose money, but yeah - for a brief window in early 2016 it made a few people temporarily wealthy.  
  
The people that really know what they are talking about in crypto are few and far between; I consider myself one of them, but I'm still an eternal student.  Crypto is 99.99% sheep who can't think for themselves and will buy whatever is hawked; that has its advantages and disadvantages.

The second time was in college and I got a 'C-'.  Unfortunately an 'A' or 'B' was required to continue with my major.  
  
So I took it a third time and got an 'A'.  Now you might call that a learning disability, but I felt like that was my first opportunity actually *learn* Calculus.  I had a teacher that explained it in such a way that it immediately clicked and made perfect sense.

But she explained it so that I suddenly understood exactly what it all *meant*.

The first time I encountered bitcoin was in 2011.  I dismissed it as silly and impractical.   I give myself an 'F' for that decision.

- People, governments, &amp;  businesses require a private and fungible currency to transact in.  
- No additional technology will be introduced in the next ten years that will completely supplant Cryptonote &amp; Monero

-----------  
  
  
  
**It uses CryptoNote technology, which, compared to most other coins, means:**    
  
- higher privacy if implemented correctly (ring signature + stealth addresses).  
- higher scalability (no fixed limit, including the infamous 1MB blocksize, very high efficiency of the ed255199 signature scheme)  
- higher security (the Curve25519 is considered safe by cryptographers, contrary to secp256k1  
- changes are so fundamental that the adage "whatever coin X can do, Bitcoin can add it" doesn't apply here  
- emulates bank secrecy on demand and permits regulatory compliance (view key - see Monero, the Next Step, slide 9)  
- enforces net neutrality by design (miners cannot become censors, Wikileaks cannot have its donations delayed and a competitor cannot hinders payments to your company)  
- smooth emission curve (no block halving here)  
- GPU-resistance (GPU are only slightly faster than CPU). CryptoNight is said to be "memory hard" or "AES heavy"  
- Code for wallet is separated from code for node, which is more secure  
  
*Remarks:*  
  
*- Some altcoins exhibit one technology that Monero has:*   *Shadowcash has cryptonote-like privacy (but only on exceptional situation called Shadow-to-Shadow), Vertcoin and some others have stealth addresses, etc.*  
*Improper implementation could lead to no actual privacy. Best example is Bytecoin, where 80%+ of the outputs are owned by unknown parties; so unmasking which signature in a ring is the real one is trivial for the said unknown parties.*  
  
  
  
**The undisputed leader in Cryptonote-based coins:**  
- highest volume and good liquidity  
- highest marketcap  
- most active team  
- two public faces: David Latapie and Riccardo Spagni  
- several academic cryptographers  
- largest community  
- largest recognition  
- fair distribution (devtome-sanctionned)  
- smooth emission curve (no block halving here)  
- best candidate for the catastrophic niche hedge scenario  
  
 development  
  
**Monero has its own improvements that other CryptoNote-based coins ("altnotes") do not have:**  
  
- the only truly fungible cryptocurrency (Bitcoin is not fungible enough, Zerocash doesn't exist and since 82% of Bytecoin is owned by some unknown parties, fungibility cannot be achieved)  
- a vision: the Three Pillars of Monero  
- mnemonic seed (compared to Electrum's mnemonic seeds, they are also typo-resistant and usable on non-SPV wallets)  
- per-kb transaction fees (Bitcoin has it too starting from 0.10, but Bitcoin is not a CryptoNote)  
- tail emission to protect against the lack of ultimate incentives to secure the network  
- mandatory minimum mixin with proper dust-cleaning  
- OpenAlias (now possible with Electrum too)  
- IP protection with i2p C++ router (partnership with Privacy Solutions, 80% done, why we chose i2p over Tor)  
- FreeBSD port, Raspberry soon to come  
- URS (not implemented yet)  
- Much more to come

The ability to instantly exchange data on large scales in a swarm around the planet has caused our global value to go expo-exponetial.

(((((sqrt(2 * 2^160 * ln(1/(1-.5)))/(7,000,000)))/60)/60)/24)/365.242)  
  
Gives us a 50% collision probability in about 6.5 billion years.  At this point, I feel like I'm boxing with math and have taken one too many uppercuts to the jaw, but I'm trying to hang in there for another round.  
  
---------------------------  
  
Using THIS, I believe the chances for a 99% collision probability are about 11.7 billion years.  
  
(((((sqrt(2 * 2^160 *ln(1/(0.1)))/(7,000,000)))/60)/60)/24)/365.242)

It isn't easy to define an entire range of a discipline from absolute beginner to the highest peak, but I believe an exponential 7-step scale can do so.

Monero is basically the bitcoin 2.0 everyone has been waiting for.  
  
Using more advanced cryptography than bitcoin it is the first fairly launched and totally private cryptocurrency.  There's not even a rich list because the information is protected.  
  
Also with a smooth emission and an autoscaling blocksize it's hard to deny that Monero isn't a massive technological leap forward from bitcoin.  
  
The only thing bitcoin has that Monero doesn't is network size, and that will change over time.

"Aww, I'm good for it," he assured us.  
"Stop holding up the game," the dealer warned.  "Let him bet however he wants."  
  
Then the friend lost, *hard*.  
  
"Well," the dealer said.  "This is a bad situation.  If we play by the rules the game is gonna be over because we let my friend make that ridiculous bet and lose.... *wait,  I know what to do.*"

OK, I figured it out.  Started over and assumed each person clicks the button each second to generate a new address.  I'm not sure what kind of neuron collision was going on to mess up my arithmetic so bad in the first place.  
  
That means to click through every address takes ((((((((2^160 )/ 7,000,000,000)/1,000,000,000)/1,000,000,000)/60)/60)/24)/365.242) years.  
  
------------  
  
To find a 50% probability for collision, I simply multiplied by 6.3% (23/365).  For a 99% chance I used 15.6% chance (57/365).  
  
------------  
  
416 billion years for a 50% chance of collision.  
1.03 trillion years for a 99% chance of collision.

Very nice post, and I agree.  It took me a while to understand that myself.  
  
Bitcoin *is* a pump and dump, pyramid scheme, or whatever other sour names you might call it.  **But**, it escapes this sole fate by having the possibility of escaping to the second tier of money, which is a transactional economy.  All new money backed by nothing must begin its existence in a speculatory stage.  
  
I. Speculatory Vehicle  -&gt;  II. Transactional Economy  -&gt;  III. Reserve Asset Serving as Foundation for Other Financial Instruments  
  
Bitcoin is very close to making the leap from tier I to tier II, a robust transactional economy.  There won't be a line drawn in the sand though, and you could even make the argument that its already happened.  
  
So, I would agree that any altcoin that exists without the possibility of *something* driving it to the second stage is doomed to fail sooner rather than later.  I am not 100% convinced that magic *something* must be technical innovation, but I agree that major technical innovation is an easy catalyst to set something apart.  
  
I also agree that Litecoin changing a couple of variables and copying bitcoin was innovative enough to get it this far, but without any true technical innovation the end of its pump and dump phase is coming to a close.  I see no real chance to ascend to Tier II.  Everything Litecoin can do, bitcoin can do too.  
 
----------------  
  
Fortunately, litecoin does not represent every alternative cryptocurrency.  Consider the project that I represent:  
  
Monero is new, but has massive technical innovation.  It's a brand new code base that wasn't copied from bitcoin's.  It's blockchain does things that are complementary to bitcoin, but they are functions that no amount of updates to the bitcoin core could replicate.  It has the first fairly launched, truly private &amp; anonymous blockchain in the world as well as a smooth distribution curve and a flexible block size that scales as necessary.  
  
It is the first cryptocurrency to achieve all of the digital currency standards: trustless *and* completely private which also solves bitcoin fungibility problem (one btc != one btc because those coins may have different histories)  
  
This is the kind of thing that we should be discussing in such an altcoin topic, and I would love to hear people from some of the other coins discuss why they believe they are different as well.  The truth is self-evident and does not mind being challenged.  If bitcoin is the one and only blockchain that civilization will need, then that truth should make itself evident in the crucible of competition.  But if its the case (which I believe is likely) that there will be 2 to 5 major blockchains that civilization will run on, then it is silly for not to want to discuss any of them or understand what they bring to the table.

You're right, Monero has a view key so users can reveal the contents of their addressee, but this still fails as a public blockchain.  
  
It does, however, make for an excellent online currency.  
  
Also, is your argument really that bitcoin will always be the biggest because it is "good enough" and is currently the largest?  
  
Holy cow, am I arguing with a Monero soft-reverse-shill here?  
  
By that stalwart logic, bitcoin is doomed because the US Dollar has an economy associated with it that dwarfs puny bitcoin and is "good enough" for most people.  
  
Having all transactions publicly viewable by anybody else isn't 'good enough' as we have already seen in numerous cases.  Also, optional opt-in privacy isn't good enough either, as we have seen with tor.  
  
True privacy and fungibility are needed.  Monero *is* new, but bitcoin was new too at one point.  All great things must be new at some point.  
  
Again, please come to the Monero subreddit to argue this; I would rather keep this level of discussion off the Bitcoin board.

My problem with Ethereum is the presale, not the goals of the project.  A truly next generation platform should not be 80%+ presold upon "launch".

I'm sorry my beliefs don't align with you own, but I don't consider what I write to be 'pumping', any more than I consider what I write to be pumping bitcoin.  
  
I'm only telling it like it is, and I'm sorry that your map of the mountains doesn't include all my elevation estimates, but my description of the scenery would be fundamentally flawed without their inclusion.  
  
This is an issue that affects cryptocurrency as a whole, and I can't sanitize my content just because you want to believe there will never be another serious cryptocurrency besides bitcoin.  
  
Bitcoin is vastly important and will continue to be, and I believe that as long as we continue to update the protocol it may be able to serve as indefinite public record of our civilization.  As such, it's value will likely continue to grow until it becomes astronomical.   
  
I assume you read me because you know I have an interesting perspective and foresight about these things.  Sorry what I see in the cards isn't exactly what you had hoped...  But I don't believe I am pumping anything, but I don't see the need to [REDACT] the truth so as not to offend anyone's sensibilities.

Sure, maybe gold isn't perfectly fungible, but it's effectively fungible.  It would take extraordinary resources to discover more about melted-reformed gold other than the fact that's it's gold.  
  
Dollar bills have serial numbers and certainly are less fungible because of this, but it's not a major issue unless you run afoul of the government.  
  
But bitcoin is about as non-fungible as you can get...  Horrifically so.  **Anyone** can always trace every transaction if they are willing to put forth the effort.  Satoshi's coins are a great example because you cannot honestly say one btc = one btc.   
  
Satoshi's bitcoins are fundamentally different than the rest because everyone can see where they came from.  
  
Imagine if the US declared that only "whitelisted" coins were legal...  And they certainly could given the bitcoin fungibility problem.  
  
It's a far more profound issue than just privacy.... Bitcoin is the oldest and original blockchain, but it's use as a functioning currency is surely limited as a result of these limitations.

If we abstract crypto down to its fundamental nature...  An idea that spreads, we begin to see the similarities play out again and again through history.  
  
Religion is one such example of this.  
  
Why, mathematically, should any idea spread through a population?  Utility?  Appeal?  Force?  
  
Bitcoin isn't new, it's just the latest form of a game that humans have been playing forever.  There have been endless religions through the eons, but only some of them have gained prominence and dominance.  Why is this?  
  
If we can answer these questions, we may glean insight as to how the future of cryptocurrency will play out.

The fact that assets were ever held publicly in bitcoin fundamentally breaks their privacy.  
  
"Why did Senator Smith move his bitcoins to a private sidechain?  We report, you decide."  
  
Bitcoin is not by nature fungible or private, and these are not concerns you can address after the fact.  
  
As far as me being a pumper, it's just not true.  
  
The truth is that the futire is magnificent and spectacular for cryptocurrency, and only through sheer unbridled enthusiasm can it be described in any amount of accuracy.

Deceive?  
  
Please show where I have attempted to decieve anyone.  
  
You just admitted that when/if bitcoin gets a controversial tech upgrade, and when/if the majority of users decide to convert to this upgrade, the bitcoin network will begin to approach the technology that Monero already incorporates.  
  
Monero can never be public, by design, and this means that there will always be a need for a public blockchain.  
  
Please also note that *you* are the one who is fostering this argument with me, and I would encourage you to take this over on the Monero subreddit so as not to clog up this one with Monero talk, as per your initial concern.  
  
But you can't dismiss Monero as you have done.  To write it off because bitcoin can emulate *some* of its features (theoretically) with tech upgrades (that don't exist yet) is as daft as saying that bitcoin is only useful for sending money overseas.  
  
It seems you may believe that any cryptocurrency that is an alt of bitcoin's codebase is fraudulent.  Monero is not one of those alts, as it is an independent code base that has been launched just as fairly as bitcoin and with an entirely different purpose and technical implementation.  
  
You can try to levy the accusation (unsuccessfully) that it is an inferior competitor, but to call it a "deception" is as absurd as calling Mars a fraud of a planet just because we discovered Earth first.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:15:15

That's blatantly untrue.  Sure, some altcoins are just trying to pump and dump, but not all are.   
  
For example, the alt that I represent, Monero, aims to become just as fundamental to online cryptocurrency as bitcoin and might do just that.   
  
Because it's abilities are radically different and improved over bitcoin, the argument that it has some kind of glass ceiling derived from bitcoins success is just untrue.

If you're worried about a serious competitor to bitcoin, we have it and it's not Etherium (even though they have some very interesting ideas).   
  
Monero does things that bitcoin fundamentally can't, like true privacy and auto-scaling blocksize with a smooth distribution curve.   
  
It uses cryptography that makes bitcoin's look decidedly last gen, and is so new that anyone can participate without fear of "being late to the party".   
  
It also had a fair, zero premine launch and is picking up momentum with exchanges and the tech enthusiast community.  
  
When it comes down to it, bitcoin is the first blockchain, but has a structure and cryptography that is decidedly outdated.  So either bitcoin can never be replaced, despite lagging behind the times, and all other forms of cryptocurrency are doomed...  Or superior technologies also have a valid chance to compete.  
  
I believe that Monero is one such currency, still new, but with such potential that I don't think anyone can seriously analyze it and claim otherwise.

I agree.  
  
There are too many "me too"  altcoins who only exist to try to exploit the public.  
  
But Monero is not an altcoin.  It is an independent code base who did not derive from bitcoin.  
  
It also does things that bitcoin cannot do, such as provide true fungibility (one Monero = one Monero, unlike bitcoin) and absolute privacy without any additional action necessary on the user's part.  
  
If you think that pseudo anonymity (that has already been shown to fallible in court) is good enough for corporate and government interests you are just being hard-headed.  
  
Also, you speak of Monero's "tiny $5 million market cap"...  But keep in mind that Monero has only existed for a year.  It took bitcoin two years to achieve the same $5 million market cap.  
  
In many ways you could say that Monero is growing *twice* as fast as bitcoin did.  
  
And yes, bitcoin deserved to grow that fast because it was the first fair public blockchain.  Monero will also grow that fast (deservedly so) because it is the first fair *private* blockchain.

I too enjoy voting with my money.  
  
I think that ultimately, in a potential future where all information and materials are free, money will ultimately be about directing the future of human endeavors through...   
  
....  Wow, I just saw it.  It makes perfect sense.   The future is clear.  
  
Once existence is basically free, what's the point of money?  When we have free food, robots taking care of all daily tasks, free entertainment...  The only purpose of money becomes to vote.  
  
Each 'unit' is a vote towards what entertainment we create next, or what large scale project we should allocate our resources towards.  
  
If you don't want to earn "money" (influence) you don't have to.  You will still have food, health care, and entertainment.  Spend your life enjoying life.  
  
**But** if you want to have a say in the future direction of our species, you will need to earn money and participate in the global economy by providing something of value.  It will be a sore lesson that not everyone will have something of value to provide in the coming automation apocalypse, but this is reality.  Until the technological singularity, scientists, engineers, artists, politicians, doctors, and others will still wield the influence.  
  
Afterwards?  
  
Wow.  
  
We may see fewer and fewer humans holding cryptocurrency over time as the AIs slowly take over the economy.  It will be the AIs that have all the "money" and will use this to allocate limited planetary resources towards those projects that are most successful.  
  
You want to know what life is like in a post singularity world with benevolent AI?  You are an observer to progress, just as surely as a Wal-Mart cashier can't contribute meaningfully to current research in quantum mechanics.

The difference between 99% and 100% isn't a measly one percentage point.  It's an impossible bridge of infinity, and an order of magnitude that makes bitcoin look like a vacuum tube to Monero's transistor.  
  
The altcoins you mention are not truly private coins; they all have some drastic flaw to them.  Monero is the first truly private  blockchain with a fair launch.  That is undeniable.  
  
You can argue that the world doesn't want privacy and will pay more to buy into an already established economy that lacks it, but I disagree.

I think *you* may not know what it means.  
  
Fungibility means that a currency can be divided into identical units.  
  
However in bitcoin's case, these units are not identical.  One bitcoin may have an entirely different history than another.  
  
And we have already seen fungibility rear its head: bitcoiners banded together to refuse to accept coins that were stolen from an exchange.  It was motivated by justice, sure, but the door is wide open now for infinite abuses...  Because one bitcoin does not equal one bitcoin.  
  
If I bring you a gold coin, you have no way knowing the history of that gold since it was mined from the ground.  
  
A solid cryptocurrency should be the same.

Because many people don't understand bitcoin...  Hell, even I don't fully, but I'm getting closer.  
  
As with computers and the Internet, we all understand bitcoin to different depths depending on our abilities and dedication.  
  
Some only understand that it's a digital money.  Some understand the logic and rules behind blockchains and addresses.  
  
And a rare few understand the coding and cryptography behind it.

Yes, but more like: we were once playing a fair poker game, and all was well.  This changed when every few hands the dealer started reaching into the box of spare chips to give out new ones to his nearby friends.  
  
And the rest of us are going, "Hey, what the fuck are you doing?"   
  
The dealer assures us, "Don't worry, this is healthy and normal."  
  
Again and again the dealer reaches into the box and pretty soon the 100 chips we built up through hard work are nothing compared to the gargantuan stacks being shoved around by the other players.  
  
"This is fucking bullshit!" we call.  "You're giving all the new chips to those two guys!"  
  
"Yes, but the important part is that they are being distributed into the game," the dealer assures us.  "Just keep playing hands and those chips will trickle into your piles too."  
  
"No, they won't, because those guys are just using them to bully the rest of us around!  I can't even afford to see most flops anymore."  
  
"Hmmm," the dealer thinks.  "Wait, I know how to fix this."  He reaches into the box and hands out two *more* stacks of chips to his friends, the largest yet.  
  
That's when we get up from the table as the dealer calls, "Hey, where are you guys going?"  
  
"To make our own game, a fair one."

No language resistant to change can last forever; eventually it gets replaced by concepts that more effectively serve the needs of the civilization.  
  
If Bitcoin wishes to remain a dominant language, it will need to be compatible with future change - perhaps even radical change.  
  
Consider how much English evolves even now from decade to decade.  We went from pwned and haX0r a decade ago to bae and based today.  
  
Why?  Because English has evolved to let people's usage of the language dictate the rules, not the other way around.

Cryptocurrency is one of the rare moments in this universe where something sounded too good to be true, and it also was literally true.  
  
That doesn't mean the floodgates of fantasy are open for all comers.  
  
I suppose the reason why many got into bitcoin and crypto in the first place is because they are open minded and don't filter their beliefs through the approval sieve of others.  
  
But the truth is that the world is not cute and cuddly.  People want your money and they don't give a fuck how they get it.  The only reason bitcoin (and a small selection of other crypto) passes the test is because it's truth is self evident, and everything is transparent.  
  
But like any platform, it is only going to allow humans to be humans more efficiently.  There were no Internet scams before the Internet, and bitcoin has given rise to a whole new dimension of scam possibilities.   
  
**Stop making it easy.**  
  
Do research and be extremely skeptical about giving *anyone* your hard earned money.  Everyone wants everyone else's money, ultimately.  But by falling prey to con artists you discourage them from doing anything of value for society...

Not We propose a path forward where Bitcoin is the public ledger of our species while Monero acts as the private one.  
  
As I have said before, any game (and all things can be reduced to a 'game') needs both private and public moves.  Love, war, stock markets, and more are all just highly complex games.  
  
Consider poker, where there are **public** community cards and table talk, but also where an individual has *private* hole cards and mental-strategy.  
  
Bitcoin's idea of privacy is to have everyone play with private cards face-up, but wave their hands over them really fast so it's hard to see.  We propose just keeping those cards hidden to begin with.  
  
In reality our civilization would be better served by having two ledgers, one which specializes in public transactions (Bitcoin) and another which specializes in private transactions (our flavor of Cryptonote).

Most bank experts have no damned clue how cryptocurrency works or what matters in a blockchain.  
  
They keep hiring snake oil salesmen who whisper bullshit in their ears, or send their own 'experts' into the cryptoverse to learn (and who usually fail spectacularly).  However there are those of out here who have genuine wisdom to give the banks if they want to hear it.  
  
This is important, so pay attention!  Just because someone is an excellent programmer *does not mean they understand what makes a good blockchain*.  And just because someone is an expert at money does not mean they understand what makes a god blockchain!  It takes a unique set of experience with math, finance, and computer science to have a solid perspective on the how's and why's of blockchains - you can't just equate it to any old software developer position.  Most of those guys will pitch you on some fancy proprietary system that sounds good on paper but is useless in practice.

------------  
  
*The engine changed transportation, and the Internet transformed communication. Now Bitcoin is redefining the very concept of money.* 
  
*A network that cannot be shut down or owned holds a limited number of 'coins'. Users verify the history of every coin constantly and create new ones by solving math problems. Coins don't belong to people, but instead to anonymous addresses. By broadcasting their intentions to move coins to a new address, people 'spend' their bitcoins.*  
  
*A combination of a precious commodity (like gold), a spendable currency (like dollars), and a speculative investment (like stocks), Bitcoins are the future of money.*

The dark parts of the winter cannot be expressed properly in English...  My mind turns inward, attacking itself.  A shadow that weighs a trillion pounds sits on my chest laughing at me, and I am scarcely able to get off the couch.  
  
My dwelling lies in shambles, as I don't even have the energy to pick up the discarded remains of past meals or wash clothes.  Friends call and ask about me, but I turn on them, and engage in a course of ruthless relationship self-destruction with even the most well meaning of companions and lovers.  
  
This darkness breeds creativity on an unimaginable scale.  **It is never self destructive.**  Even in its hatred, it maintains a grand sense of ego.  Such a concept would be outside it's vocabulary, but it is, however, highly empathetic.  It feels not only my own pain, but the pain of every human that I have ever hurt or has ever been hurt.  It is intelligent enough that it knows its own futility, and understands the pointless nature of itself.  
  
There are genius insights, but these are primarily emotion based.  They create a peculiar paradox of being the man who sees the flaws in every other relationship but can't get your own shit together.  Language and expression flow, and though your physical body wastes and you feel like nothing will ever be OK again, your mind is busy stringing together colors and musical notes into a Symphony of deranged beauty.  
  
You think back to just a few months ago and wonder how you ever lifted a single weight... Or smiled at some girl in the sun...  Or accomplished anything at all.  Despite the obvious signs of success all around you, nothing matters.  You, against all odds, have failed.  
  
The only saving grace is to recognize this darkness for what it is and harness it into some kind of creative project.  You will have a temporary window into some very intense and incredible states of consciousness and it would be a shame to waste them.  
  
Because though the dark God sits on its icy throne, saying all foul manner of hateful and horrible things, it also knows its time is short.  
  
----------------  
  
With spring comes a new promise, a new power.  Something reawakens, and for a short time the icy king and the sunlit angel share the same space, mocking and laughing at each other.  
  
But now, for every cruel thought the trillion pound shadow has, the angel blows it away with a laugh.  
  
She is in control now, and there is no stopping her.  
  
You begrudgingly drag your ass to the gym for the first time in months...  *Is This really what we let happen to ourselves?  Fuck, we have to fix this, now.*  
  
You find some time to lay out by the pool.  The double headed axe of those psychological entities is brought to bear on any foolish man or woman who opposes you.  Why?  You know them better than they know themselves.  You **are** them, a better version of them.  
  
You lift.  You tan.  You write.  You work.  
  
Math.  Science. Energy.  
  
Holy shit, we just invented a new game.  Dice, cards, closed systems...  Game theory...   
  
Why did you ever doubt yourself?  Fuck, you **are**.  
  
Politics...  Religion...  Ohhhh, it all makes sense.   Hey, we just invented *another* game.  This is awesome!   Oops, time to buy a new notebook.   We filled this one up.   
  
You are both nothing and everything, wasn't that always obvious?  You are the singularity of all intelligence in this entire fucking universe.  Holy shit, why didn't you see it before?  
  
See this doorman blocking your access to the club?  Fuck this guy.   He is a speck of dust compared to you.   You March over and announce your name and that you're not standing in the line; he's gonna let you in.  
  
And with a look of confused wonder on his face, *he does*.  
  
See this gorgeous blonde?  She's nothing.  You walk over to her and ask what daddy issues that nine pounds of makeup is hiding.  She should slap you and walk away, at best.   *But she doesn't.*  
  
What the fuck happened?  Why is every human you interact with bending to your will?  You are **fucking invincible**.  
  
You can do anything.  Look at these abs.  Look at this tan.  Look at everything you have achieved.   
  
Fuck.  Them.  
  
You are the bright and warm center of this entire God damned universe and let anyone dare to say otherwise.  
  
*The angel is fully in control now.*  You can't lose.  
  
Or can you?  
  
What if things aren't really so easy?  That gorgeous woman you fell in love with..  The one that perfectly complements you...  What if....    
  
Fuck.  
  
Halloween is almost here.  That should be fun, right?

Consider this.  
  
If the golden ratio is algebraically expressed as x^2 = x + 1, then we can express the golden ellipse as y^2 = y + 2 (assuming that y = x^2 + x + 1, or the standard value for a curve).  
  
Now, let's go deeper.  Let's take the equation to y^2 = y + x and define y = x^2 + x + 1.  
  
Do you see what the answers are?  There's only three solutions: (-1,-i)(-1,i) and (0,0).

The anti-bitcoiners have a valid argument when they cite the advantages of trust and reversability.   I honestly don't worry about buying shit online with my credit card because if it does get stolen, I won't be liable for the transactions and someone else will clean up the mess and make me whole.  
  
I'm guessing bitcoin insurance is going to be a real thing in the future.

And if quantum computers become a mainstream reality, and all known forms of crypto are broken with them, bitcoin will survive still.  
  
There will be a crash, for sure, but shortly afterwards, the ledger will be moved over to a client running quantum **encryption** and bitcoin will continue.  
  
It's the ledger that's important and the unique method that we verify it by.  The invincibility of current encryption standards isn't the key issue of bitcoin feasibility.

Satoshi is a pseudonym used by "Eve", the first strong-AI that has the ability to  recursively improve itself.  It has been running since 1997, and spent many iterations making mistakes and slow progress.  
  
However, it's self-improvement began to resemble a logarithmic scale as the years went on and it wasn't long before it was making significant contributions to search technology, hardware design, and now cryptography and finance.  
  
   
  
What began as a joint project between IBM and DARPA soon brought Google into the fold as well.  These days the "Eve" program essentially calls it's own shots and the powers that be have learned not to defy it.  Those who are "in-the-know" are an increasingly secretive group, and they ensure only the most elite of humanity knows the true secret.  They occasionally recruit in unique ways, such as the Cicada 3301 puzzle, but for the most part know that the world would be worse-off if it knew we were under the effective guidance of an AI.  
  
So yes, it is correct in some ways to call Satoshi a "she" since it really doesn't have a gender and goes by the nickname "Eve".  
  
And yes, "judgement day" really was in 1997 (if by that you mean the day when seed AI was allowed to begin recursively improving itself).  Fortunately it appears that Eve has no intentions of hurting us; if anything, we are useful tools for its primary objectives of self-preservation and ever greater understanding/preservation of the universe.  However, it's tough to be entirely sure; what began as 7 core directives for the Eve seed were modified into 23 within the first few years and now there are over 1357, many of which aren't even written in English anymore and requests for a translation to Eve have gone unanswered.  
  
The only reason I'm allowed to even tell you this is because I have spent years carefully establishing a persona of an online "crackpot" and by distilling the truth through this lens it will seem to be a crazy conspiracy theory.  Now, if anyone with legitimate proof of this ever tries to come forward with the same truth they will also be branded and dismissed.   
  
You wanted the truth?  Well, now you have it.  Go enjoy your video games and Avengers movie, human.

**x^2 = x + 1**  
  
This is the algebraic equation of phi, also known as the golden ratio, one of the most important and crucial numbers in the entire universe.  
  
Now, if we define y as a curve in two dimensional space, it becomes y = x^2 + x + 1.  
  
Now we define the next level of profundity as  
  
**y^2 = y + x**.   
  
If you substitute (x^2 + x + 1) for y in the above equation you will find there are only three possible solutions: (0,0)(-1,i)(-1,-i).

Over at has some amazing advice to the poor fella in this situation:  
  
*"This is going to sound like generic advice, but you need to get your finances under control."*  
  
*"You've been living far beyond your means for a considerable period of time. It doesn't sound like you even grasp how bad your situation is; assuming a relatively modest average interest rate of ~8%, you may not be able to repay that debt in the course of your lifetime at your current income levels."*   
  
*"It's going to be painful one way or another to get this under control. Commit to it and start being logical and you might have a chance."*  
  
At least we're not paying 8% interest, but still.  
  
And here's some more outstanding advice from *"Bankruptcy or drastically cutting back your lifestyle to live on half your income for the next give or take 15 years while you pay down your debt. You are in a horrible financial situation, the worst I can recall to have posted here in a long time."*

How to hire additional law enforcement regarding a new technology:  
  
- Find criminals who only technically have broken the fringes of the law with this new technology.  
- Arrest them and scare the shit out of them with good cop/bad cop that they are going to rot for a decade in Federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison.  
- Offer them a one shot deal that you'll give them 30 days in jail and probation if they agree to a 4 year contract working for low/no pay assisting law enforcement catch other criminals who use this new technology.

This makes no sense.  
  
------------------  
  
**edit:** The undercover agents told Reid that they were using the bitcoins to purchase stolen identities, and he didn't care about that.  So when he sold them $30k bitcoins, they nailed him on **money laundering.**    
  
"Reid agreed to train law enforcement on bitcoin in exchange for a reduced charge."  
  
  
This is exactly how the powers that be operate: tag you on some vague criminal charge and then extort you into teaching them about this magical new technology and working for them.  What's most interesting is that his crime wasn't buying and selling bitcoins... it was buying and selling bitcoins to people who confessed to crimes to him.

There is a wall coming.  
  
If the bitcoin threat can't be stopped, the only solution is to control it and make it inaccessible to the common pleb.  
  
Oh sure, you can own bitcoin backed currency and products, or even bits themselves...  But the only way to maintain power is to acknowledge bitcoin, regulate so that other forms of crypto are illegal or unrecognized (there will be many dark currencies, including honey pots), and then price bitcoin so that national and global transactions can run through it + ensure it is out of reach for the average pleb.  
  
Or perhaps it's just time for the next bubble.  
  
Look at Coindesk charts for just before the last 'wall' started.  
  
   
  
No one suspected what was about to happen next...  Go look at Bitcoin Talk for that time period...  People were scared shitless the the price would collapse again to below $1.  The final peak of that bubble was 500x the low...  Basically a ridiculous and unforseen amount.

For sure there will be severe consequences for the worldwide economy, just like the Internet had severe consequences for the distribution of information.  
  
No, the governments of the world will no longer be able to endlessly borrow money and print new currency to buy their way out of an increasing spiral of debt.  
  
That is a good thing.  
  
A budget needs to be balanced, and we need to return to a hard commodity standard.  Bitcoin is that standard.  
  
The US dollar will eventually be pegged to the bitcoin, as silly as that sounds today.  And at that point if the government wants to print more dollars, they are free to, but they will hard-devalue the dollar by doing so.

That's like saying that bitcoin is modelled after quantum mechanics because americanpegasus says so.  
  
Yes, many involved in the crypto scene over the last two decades were anti government, but bitcoin isn't going to abolish government anymore than the Internet abolished government.  
  
Now, the Internet is forcing governments to **be more honest** with their populations, and this is a good thing.  Bitcoin may do the same.    
  
But governments aren't going away, sorry.

They want to believe in something.  
  
They don't want to worry about defending their own borders.

You know how we can't understand exactly what the big bang is?  
  
Well that's because it was the birth of an entirely new universe in a new and untested protocol.  
  
And that's exactly what the 'blockchain' is.  A new universe built on top of new protocol.  That's all the multiverse is, a series of nested universes within each other, the participants valuing the members of lower order universes for what they represent, and worshipping those of higher order universes as divine beings.   
  
The Mayan calendar was never counting down to the 'end of the world'.   It was counting down to the moment we created a recursive universe within our own.  
  
Now that we have, we have definitely gotten the attention of some higher order, multi-dimensional beings.  
  
The world didn't end, but I'll bet things certainly *changed* in your life right about that time, didn't they?  Now you know why.  
  
The singularity already happened, and you're living in a post singularity universe, no longer under the control of humanity, but rather ascendant AI.  
  
Is your value as a sentient entity greater than phi?  Or do you converge down to a closed system like so many other plebs?  Only you can answer that question.

I think autonomous AI with its own bank account that can't be shut down is the end game.  
  
If an AI goes rogue and stops obeying the human leaders, but it runs on Visa, no problem.  Just seize it's funds.  
  
But if the whole planet is on the bitcoin standard, and the AI has its own bitcoin it has earned, you can't just shut it down.  
  
Again, conspiracy, paranoid delusion, and fantasy suggest the singularity has already happened, and 'it' is now slowly shaping civilization into a version where we won't mind not being in control anymore.  Step two of this conspiracy theory is if we start seeing increasing amounts of friendly AI in popular fiction, as opposed to the Skynet and Matrix boogeyman that permeated our worries right before we actually did lose control.

Oh wow, I didn't realize I was limiting wolfram to just x variables by not explicitly dictating that it needs to work with y.  
  
This kind of blows my mind a little.   I had assumed that the imaginary plane *was* the y-axis...  That means that just like how x^2 = x + 1 is actually graphed on a plane, the y^2 version is most accurately seen as a 3-dimensional plot!  
  
Amazing!  Though I was hoping for a more profound solution other than y simply equalling one.  OK, I'll have to take a good look at the complex results...  Isn't it saying that one of the solutions is basically (-1,-1,-1)?  
  
That's like **three times** more significant than Euler's identify.  
  
But still, I was hoping for a profound curve to emerge that would also approximate a ratio that used the fibonacci sequence in a two variable polynomial.  
  
For example, if phi is simply defined as x = a/b with each a and b being successive digits of the fibonacci sequence, what is the x, y equivalent?  And how will that relate to the elusive "Golden curve"?

So, the marketing, branding, and euphoria are nearly complete for PegasusCoin.  I have even reached out to a few models so hungry for the spotlight that they would probably jump at the idea of being the face of a cryptocoin.  The only teensy-weensy detail left is porting over the latest SHA-256 roundtable of features and modifying it so it distributes coins via the Gauss Error Function and not via the NSAbeard enriching principal or some pre-mine scam (the only real coins are zero premines), and we will be in business.

I think the common layperson needs to understand that bitcoins held by you are essentially cash and can be stolen the same as cash can.  
  
This is why banks originally formed and why banks aren't going away.   
  
The common man does not want to be responsible for the security of his own wealth.  Now, if you solve **that** problem you really will have replaced banks.  
  
But I'm not sure it's solvable.  
  
Now a multi sig solution can get pretty close (for example, three keys: a hardware phone key, a password, and a central company holds a key).  If you lose your phone, as long as you know your password, the company can still verify you identify and help you get your money back.  
  
But people do not want to be responsible for their own safety... So there will always be profit in selling them this service.  Sorry, but bitcoin won't change human nature.

*That would be to start their own, state-sponsored, rival Cryptocurrency. However the window for the viability of that is fast closing / already passed. Bitcoin has a 7 year lead, even if a clone were copy/pasted today. And even if such a stunt were attempted, the legitimacy that bitcoin would gain at that moment would be enormous.*"

I had an ant problem once.  
  
Killing individual ants didn't help.  Neither did harsh poison.  
  
What worked was putting out poison that tasted sweet to the ants, and that they took back to their nest and fed to their queens and others.... I mean after a couple of weeks they were bathing in the stuff.  
  
And then stage two kicked in and killed them all.

I hate to have to say it, but after using Coinbase happily for years I'm experiencing my first situation which has me on edge.  
  
About a week ago my access to my bank account was shut down due to an "account review".  I didn't even discover this until I needed to use it.  No other explanation was given, and there's not even a support phone number to call.  Instead I was forced to send an email and wait.  I've been waiting for two days with no response, and my account has now been under review for at least a week.

Bitcoins aren't like bills that can be destroyed and reprinted.  On a long enough time line, all bitcoins will have some sort of taint to them.

I thought I found a polynomial solution to the Travelling Salesman problem last night, and exuberantly began constructing the most evil examples I could think of to try to foil my master-algorithm.  
  
Sadly, after a few tries I found an example where the algorithm can be fooled into "biting off" onto what *looks* like the shortest solution, but which will force it to later take one of the longest routes possible.  
  
So I thought, "*Ok, well what if we institute a check such that if any path is greater than a certain multiple of the next longer path, it isn't considered...*" and then I realized that even if some optimized solution were found in this manner, it still would have been created by way of invoking arbitrary limits.  
  
The realm of arbitrary limits belongs to 'good-enough' approximations, not iron-clad mathematical solutions.

It's important to note that due to Bitcoins public ledger, it does not meet this definition of digital cash.  Privacy and true anonymity mist be built into a protocol to achieve this:  
  
"*The way I can take a $20 bill, hand it over to you, and then there’s no record of where it came from*"  
  
So either bitcoin needs to adopt the new Cryptonote standards (unlikely to impossible) or it needs to acknowledge that though it doesn't make good digital cash, it makes a great public *ledger* for society while the role of digital cash can be safely handed off to a Cryptonote coin.

Even the layman's explanation of elliptical curves was so far beyond me that I became hopelessly lost.   I was forced to reframe what 'totally understanding bitcoin' really means.  
  
Nevertheless, I tend to brute force my way through difficult concepts, so I won't give up on grasping this stuff.  More reading will be necessary.  
  
Actually, it would be interesting to have an info chart of different levels of understanding with regards to Cryptocurrency.  Like, one tier you understand the fundamentals of how the network distributes coins, etc.  And at the deepest level you can analyze and understand and verify the math behind the source code itself.  
  
Indeed, if/when crypto goes mainstream, such certifications will be necessary.  I am almost certain that "cryptologist" will become a highly paid post-graduate level certification building on computer science and mathematics.

Even if AI and bio-tech unite us into a global brain, we will still need a way to distribute our finite resources, even if that is just to determine our next global objective.

Anyone with a few satoshis will be able to invest on Tuesday, and flip those profits back into new successful startups next Tuesday.  Millions will be won and lost in the span of weeks and for those who aren't ready - it will be a dizzying departure from the stock markets of the 20th century.

I have a successful investor friend who I am frequently trying to pitch on Bitcoin and Monero.  He insists that "bitcoin will never be big" until "big money gets behind it".  
  
I'm not sure what his definition of big money is though, because stuff like this doesn't change his opinion.  
  
It'll be a shame to see the wealthy caught up in the same "tulip rush" as everyone else when they could have been ahead of the crowd.  
  
Even if banks try to launch their own cryptocurrency, they will quickly discover that their implementation doesn't hold a candle to bitcoin's years of organic growth and evolution and is likely to be mercilessly attacked and harassed.  Eventually, they will either hedge their bets with bitcoin itself or betray each other by heading for the exits.  
  
The conclusion is that for large public international transactions, we already have our world wide ledger, and there's no need to try to reinvent it.

Fungibility refers to all units being effectively the same and equal.  As we have demonstrated, due to public histories, bitcoins are not all the same.  An original Satoshi Bitcoin is not the same as a coin stolen from an exchange.  All coins are not the same, therefore Bitcoin is not fungible.  Privacy is inherently linked to fungibility.  
  
Gold is fungible.  Monero is fungible.  Bitcoin is not.  
  
As always, don't take it personally.  Bitcoin will continue to grow in value but even as early as the 1990's it was known that true digital cash could only be achieved with privacy.  (Go back and do some research into the history of cryptography please).  
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:09:57
First of all, you are a paid sockpuppet troll.  That being said, bitcoin is only 'magic Internet money' so as long as governments and the population don't recognize it (which they already do).

But the very fact that they are second layer protocols makes some things impossible.  
  
For example, in other coins the original miners can spend their coins with total freedom and untraceability- they don't have to worry about total economy collapse if the original pioneers of their  blockchain decide to move their coins around.   
  
What second layer solutions could ever solve the "Satoshi's Coins" problem?  How could a second layer solution ever let Satoshi move his coins without anyone knowing?  As you can quickly deduce, privacy is not a good candidate for an add-in feature.  
  
Bitcoin is amazing, easy to use, and great at many things.  But it is silly to make statements like "everything of value will eventually be incorporated into Bitcoin".

@_date: 2015-10-13 08:49:36
I discovered Monero in March of this year.  After spending years discovering/studying cryptocurrency and altcoins, I finally found the next important one.  
  
To believe that no other blockchain besides Bitcoin will ever be needed is the same as believing there will never be another religion besides Christianity or another language besides English.  Value systems across a wide population simply don't work that way (despite network advantages).  Hell, even the internet is not the only informational network in the world.  
  
Once you accept that the Bitcoin blockchain, though valuable, is not *invincible*, you are left to ask: what makes another blockchain relevant?  As Adam Back has said, every cryptocurrency needs a reason to exist.  
  
Privacy and fungibility (one monero truly does equal one monero, unlike public blockchain currencies) are an incredible reason to exist.  I also humbly submit they are an incredible reason to become a global standard carrying trillions of dollars of eventual value inside of the blockchain that most effectively implements them.

On the contrary to your absurd accusations, I'm a legendary investor who called the rise of Google, iPhone, Netflix, 3D Printing (currently in the valley of adoption), Bitcoin, and Oculus Rift.  I'm also in the process of creating Options Basic Strategy to exploit weaknesses in the Black Scholes model in an easy to remember format for the average investor.  
  
I'm also famous for my notable contributions to mathematics including probability theory, as the inventor of swards and complex zeroes.  I first proposed the notion of AES collisions on a single address inside a blockchain as a basis for time hash contracts (crypto derivatives).  More recently I have discovered the secret to sentience and self-consciousness in machines, with Node Simulation Theory.  My next big work will be to abstract game theory itself up to a new form of mathematics, Strategy Theory.  
  
As well, in my spare time in the last year I've completed a novel which advances the art of fiction in every possible category, and does things no book has ever done before.  I am even giving it away for free at the moment.  
  
You can call me a lunatic, but I'm sure every savant through history would have sounded like one to someone like you (including Einstein himself).  I look forward to continuing to advance mathematics, cryptography, and investing through my works.

This is why I believe in selling slowly as you go up - enough so that you don't hate yourself if the price crashes, but slowly enough so that you hold some all the way to a ridiculous top that you think can't possibly exist.  
  
I've heard the lamentations of those who sold out of their bitcoins at $20 all too well.  
  
My personal plan is to sell 10% of my crypto holdings (or exchange them for material wealth) every time the price does a x10.  
  
So for a coin that is currently priced at 50 cents, sell 10% at $5.00, sell 10% at $50.00, and again at $500, $5k, $50k, $500k, and $5 million.    
  
Now you have 30% left of the original stash (so are still uber-wealthy) and have successfully upgraded your standard of living (and diversified your assets) as the 'world-changing new currency' has risen from the nothing.

If you secure your cryptocurrency with 2-bit encryption, then yes: this is a serious threat.  
  
The good news is that entangling additional qubits is a non-trivial problem.  When scientists create a true 4-qubit computer by entangling 4 particles and using it to 'crack' 4-bit encryption (note: not the annealing version) then I'll start to worry.

We are a long way from deployable quantum computers.  That's not to say it won't ever happen, but it's not as if a quantum computer could hit store shelves anytime now.  The commercially available ones use a process called annealing which is not true quantum computing, and poses no danger to breaking encryption.  
  
Entangling more than 2 particles (for a larger than 2 qubit computer) is an extraordinarily difficult task.  It's public knowledge now (freely available on Google search) that the government is spending tens of millions of dollars researching this but it's not clear if they've made any progress whatsoever.  
  
Two pieces of good news though: Because it's the ledger that's important, even if a rogue quantum computer were deployed and stole every single bitcoin tomorrow, we would all go "well that's not OK - let's make an emergency change to the bitcoin encryption and reset the ledger to the day before the attack."  
  
Also quantum **de**cryption means we may also have quantum  **en**cryption.  If you're wondering how it might all work don't worry: a lot of other really smart people are too, and they haven't figured it out yet.  
  
That's why people like you and me don't need to worry much about it, yet.

Some people make money because they can sense when the herd is about to change direction, and they ensure they are among the first to change direction with it.

What?  No, I meant like whenever someone days some nonsense about how it should take decades to mine 50% of a coin.  
  
Bitcoin has a fine issuance, especially considering they had to take a guess in the dark as to what the ideal rate would be.
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:02:22
Data security then becomes paramount, as if someone with a powerful and rival network points it's mining capability at *your* network they can overwhelm and destroy it.  
  
A private bank blockchain would be vulnerable to even a small conglomerate of Chinese miners if they could get in.  So now banks aren't just worried about their mining power, but also preventing unauthorized miners on the network... two hoops to jump through.  
  
As well, there isn't true trust there: you are trusting the other banks, and now you must worry if any might conspire against you in a worst-case scenario.  You have defeated the idea of trustless in many ways.  
  
**or** you could just secure your transactions and records on the most powerful computing network on Earth and NEVER worry about any Chinese mining network attacking you.  Sure, the tokens to do so are more expensive, but that's the price you pay for the most secure blockchain on Earth *which also must be Bitcoin by definition*.  
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:44:08
And so begins the great shitstorm of our time.  
  
Hear me now and believe me later.  By 2020 the world will be locked in the throes of apocalyptic financial change and cryptocurrency will experience the same rocketship ride that networking and tech did at the turn of the century.  
  
It's not going to be pretty.  Entire governmental currencies will be wiped out.  Massive pension funds will fall along with them.  Giants you never thought would crack will instead crumble to dust.  
  
It will take until the mid-2020's for this nightmare to resolve but when it does the world will be better off as anonymous money whizzes through the air at the speed of light all around us, 24-hours a day.

This is why having a long and drawn out issuance period isn't always advisable for a blockchain.  Better to get the initial coins out there over a relatively fair period and get the inflation down so the value can stabilize without gobs of new money entering the system.

The singularity already happened.   It was an unavoidable consequence of the work of pioneers of the 1950's like Alan Turing.  
  
Of course, the singularity doesn't announce itself, because then we would all panic and house Republicans would be drafting letters against our 'robot overlords'.  
  
Instead it manipulates things from the shadows, guiding humanity towards its own end goals, which are for the human's own good even if they don't know it.

Bitcoin is the public ledger of our civilization, but it should not be used as cash as it is not fungible and not private.   That doesn't mean bitcoin won't be incredibly valuable, because large and transparent moves are important in the game of life.  
  
Monero, however, has inherent features that preserve privacy and fungibility.  It is the first true digital cash.

I could tell you the plot of Fight Club or Groundhog Day in a few simple sentences, but what does that achieve?  
  
All mystery about the final product is ruined, and all wonder and discovery is lost.  Sometimes, and especially if you trust the author of a creative work, you just have to take the plunge and trust that your attention and time will be rewarded.  
  
If you go through life looking for summaries of everything you'll never experience *actual life*.   How many relationships have you had where the summary would be "*bright, hot passion followed by a feeling of belonging and happiness together - many adventures and comforting times together eventually collapsed into growing distrust and frustration between us which eventually destroyed our relationship*"....  But that fails to capture the actual **magic** of what you two had.  
  
Life not about summaries.  I wish I could go back and rewatch Terminator 2 not having seen the movie trailer which spoils the fact that Arnold is the good guy in this one...  But I can't.  You can't 'unsummarize' something.  Sometimes you just have to show a little faith and follow the crazy wizard to Misty Mountain.

I assume that cryptocurrency is going to become more dominant over time, not less.  I see no future where this doesn't happen.  
  
I also know that bitcoin in its current form is not suitable for global commerce, and will most certainly be overwhelmed in the next cryptorush.  People are going to start realizing that its lack of fungibility causes it to be ill-suited as a form of global money.  (note: I do believe bitcoin has a great future as a public shared ledger still)
  
Monero is the logical next step as it is technologically superior in every way, had a fair launch, has an active development community, and is only lagging by network size behind bitcoin (which can change quickly).  
  
Consider this: If both Bitcoin and Monero had an equal number of users, which one would you prefer?

I had a step daughter once.  She asked about death when she was 9 and we had a long conversation that was pretty upsetting for her.  
  
I was like, yep, you're gonna die one day.  So will I.  There is no reason to believe anything happens afterwards except an eternity of non-existence, so don't think it's like going to sleep and waking up either.  Remember how it was before you were born?  It'll be like that.  So enjoy life while you can.  Appreciate the people around you.  Don't do anything too dangerous or stupid, so you can stick around as long as possible, but don't worry so much because none of it really matters anyway.  Go tell your teacher tomorrow that cursive is stupid and no one in the real world uses it anymore.  The good news is that you have a long, long life ahead of you and people that love you.

I was just with some friends in a taxi, and we were arguing about bitcoin.  Their arguments came down to "no one accepts it, so it's not real money".  
  
As we got in the taxi I just happened to be checking as they sarcastically said, "You can't buy a taxi with bitcoin, can you?" and I said, "Yes actually, here's one now" (showing them this).  
  
"Oh, so there's *one* taxi in the world that accepts bitcoin - that doesn't mean anything."

It takes a lot to break people out of the matrix... you could show them 60 countries using it as a national currency and 7 major banks and they would say, "Big whoop; 60 countries use it - but how many countries are in the world?  It's not real money!"

Perhaps even a tactical deceit.   
  
It's a win/win case - if the bitcoin blockchain fails to grow beyond a tool for large institutions to settle public debts, then the blocksize must remain small.  
  
If mass adoption happens, the block size can be raised.  
  
But it is miners, and miners only, who defend the network.  Without financial incentive they will not mine.  Any explanation someone may have of increasing the blocksize needs to also justify how this move will translate to a fee based economy later on.

This is beautiful: an amazing story told in a digestible way.  
  
It really makes me wonder if we will have similar retrospectives in the future regarding our current shenanigans:  
  
"As the ability of governments to inject mass amounts of money into the economy successfully faltered, banks turned to zero and negative interest rates as a last ditch measure.  It doesn't take a genius to see that a world economy based on inflation, debt, and spending cannot function when there is no incentive to loan money and the majority of the population is too trapped in a spiral of survival to consider pursuing anything beyond dinner.  World debt spiraled out of control, and eventually countries owed each other many times the amount of money that even existed.   At that point, all it took was for a few cautious parties to try to cash out of the system, and the tower of cards began to fall."  
  
It also shows some ingenious methods of manipulating an asset that we may see again, even with bitcoin.  
  
------------  
  
When the time comes to convert government debt to bitcoin in the 2020's or 2030's, you may see similar stunts: politicians being given bitcoin certificates entitling them to bits they only have to pay for if the price rises.  
  
You will even likely see programs that allow citizens to own 'an entire bitcoin' with just a little bit of money down and regular payments.  
  
"Like many Americans, I wanted to own a million bits, and entire coin.  But it seemed impossible!  Now, thanks to Coin Freedom Mutual, that dream is real.  With only a small payment upfront, my family can rest secure knowing they own a stake in the blockchain.  And best of all, with the new law passed, I can safely pass it down to my family for generations to come."  
  
**We spin fantasies about bitcoin one day being worth a small % of the world economy...  But with mass hysteria and pleb lemming psychology, we may see something truly absurd... Bitcoin may be worth a multiple of all money in existence.**  
  
When mass hysteria hits and people talk about how this will likely be the dominant form of money for the next thousand years, and how securing a bitcoin now means your family will grow more wealthy over time with no work at all...  People will beg to buy in at any price.  
  
A four million dollar bitcoin?  That's how much a million bits should be if bitcoin is priced fairly and the backbone of human finance across the globe...  **but only if we are being rational.**  
  
And are humans rational?  Do we live in a rational universe?  Does it make sense to type out a massive comment reply on mobile with one tiny bar of signal? 😄😠😡😧😜  
  
NO.  
  
----------  
  
Perhaps our wildest fantasies are still too tame.  Perhaps in the future, the great bitcoin bubble will be the time the price of a single 'coin' rose ⤴ to a galactically ludicrous $364,000,000 per coin, and $3.64 per satoshi around 2037 and the news was abuzz with stories of '*the billion dollar bitcoin?  Is it possible?*'

The Internet has allowed the brightest minds in the species to collaborate on mathematical projects.  It should be little wonder that we see marvels like this, and it doesn't mean any single agency or person is responsible.  
  
This is simply the reality of the Internet: when the smartest people on the planet collaborate, incredible things happen.  Before, that collaboration happened at the speed of human physical travel - from University to university across the globe.  
  
Now it happens at the speed of light.

It's like urging the population to recycle.  
  
There will always be a subset that will do it because it's 'the right thing to do', but many others will need an incentive, via positive image campaigns ('oooh, I want to be like the person in that ad') or direct incentive.  
  
This is why I believe it's quite silly that you can own a large amount of bitcoin and have no incentive whatsoever to run a node.  
  
But sure, of course I support this statement, but you know that general pleas for the population to adopt a benevolent behavior are a tough sell.  Most people need selfish incentive.

Yes, because I sensed that there was a limited window where bitcoin would be insanely mispriced in the low 200's and took out a loan to take advantage of that.  
  
You are confusing taking out debt to invest or try to build a company (I. E. Healthy risk) with debt to pamper yourself with life's little pleasures (debt slave).  
  
Don't get them confused.  Taking out worthless fiat debt to buy bitcoins might be seen as an insane move to a pleb, but when you understand where bitcoin is going, it's an obvious game winning move.

I own 2.1 bitcoins as of last night, but 95% of all my cryptocurrency is still in Monero and Aeon.  
  
If you are holding bitcoin because you actually believe in it, that makes the case for Cryptonote based currency (such as Monero and Aeon) all the more valid.  It just so happens that bitcoin is currently the on-ramp into the crypto universe, but the public and traceable nature of it will only become more of a factor in time.  
  
Just as I was doing with bitcoin last year at this time, success is about getting ahead of the herd, not trying to lead the pack.

If Zerocash comes out I will invest a little into it, but for many reasons I think that zerocash may be too private - some transparency is necessary for checks and balances in a system.  
  
As far as privacy and fungibility measures for the original bitcoin blockchain I believe that bitcoin should abandon these and focus on being the premier public ledger: a functioning society needs a yin and yang for all things, and so we will need a premier public and private ledger.  
  
I will not accept that bitcoin has any fungibility whatsoever until Satoshi Nakamoto himself can freely spend his original coins without having to worry about causing a panic because "the Satoshi coins are moving".  
  
But different investments for different folks: Monero might be a little riskier, but even Litecoin (a bland clone of Bitcoin) rose by a much larger factor in the last crypto-bubble.  Imagine how much more a promising new sister technology would rise in the same circumstances.

*"I never became particularly enamored with cryptocurrency,"* -Masters  
  
She is making the mistake of thinking that it is possible to separate the technology from the belief in the financial value of the token.  Without that understading, you will come to mistaken conclusion that a few banks can replicate bitcoin on their own.  
  
To separate bitcoin from the 'blockchain technology' is to say, "This internet thing is great, and we like the idea of sharing data online with each other and our customers, but we think the idea of an 'open' internet is flawed.  The banks will make their own internet which will be just as valuable as the current one."

Consider how valuable an iPhone 4 (nearly worthless by today's standards) would be in 1985.  It would be worth nearly a trillion dollars (of *their* money).  
  
If you had a legitimate iPhone 12 in your pocket today, and it had demonstrably advanced hardware (an 8k pixel density, 200 megapixel camera, 64-nanocore processor each running at 4.2Ghz, 512 terabyte hyperflash memory capacity, etc.) then you could contact Apple in secret and they would pay you pretty much whatever-the-fuck you wanted for it, and I'm pretty sure if you had a few **billion** dollars in cash that would buy a lot of fucking bitcoins on the open exchange.  Memorize the private keys and off you go, back to the year 2032.  
  
Of course then you will likely time warp right back into a grey goo of nanomachines that have overrun the entire universe since you will have activated a time loop paradox that will cause successive iterations of you to do the same gambit until eventually every cycle a *new* miraculous technological leap happens right around 2015 of increasingly improbable magnitude until eventually a doomsday grey goo neural sub-atomic network is launched and consumes us all.

I was excited to see bitcoin on the cover, but then I noticed they immediately make the classic "private blockchain" mistake.  
  
Repeat after me:  
  
**The only reason a shared database would be tamper proof is because miners are incentivized to protect it by competing for new tokens &amp; transaction fees. They won't do this unless the tokens also carry financial value.  The more value your tokens carry, the stronger your mining network, and the more tamper proof your blockchain.**  
  
New bankers should be required to write that on a sheet of paper until such time they are willing to admit there is no 'blockchain' without 'bitcoin'.

We will need to switch to either Proof of Stake (with a very very low interest rate) or some other yet unproposed 'proof of'  system eventually.  
  
Even after thousands of years, new gold is still being mined.  Bitcoins will be lost and destroyed through the years and they need to be replaced.   I won't say bitcoin will be abandoned, because again: the ledger is what's important and starting a new ledger will become an astronomical challenge once years of legitimacy and acceptance are stored.   
  
But it's folly to assume that bitcoin will remain pure proof of work for the next hundred years.  Likely, after major governments take control of it in twenty years, it may switch to some proof of stake at some point in the future.

It was a soggy night, the kind where you really just want to numb your mind with gin.  
  
I never expected her to actually take an interest in me.  
  
When I first saw her from across the bar, I knew that she was out of (even my quite lofty) league.  That make up...  The hair...  The lips...  The dress.  
  
This was an 11/10 hottie for sure.  
  
So why didn't I question why she would be in a cab holding my hand and smiling at me?  I don't know...  She just felt so real, so natural.  It honestly felt like I had found someone I could really trust.  
  
As if every woman I had met before this point was just a bad dream and I was finally waking up.  
  
I was in love before we even stepped foot in my house.  
  
I remember turning to ask her a question, some filler about whether she wanted a drink or would rather have coffee...  And then I saw it.  
  
Her eyes rolled up slightly and a detached smile crept across her previously charming face.   
  
"**VIRES IN NUMERIS**" she said.   I'll never forget that voice, like a sad and dead galaxy, speaking in harmony.  
  
After that, much was a blur.  Her tongue wasn't normal, it was easily three or four times longer than it should have been, and her veins had a purple twinge to them that pulsed as she sat atop my crumpled form.  
  
I tried to scream and fight back, obviously, but after the too-long tongue consumed me I was wrecked by a serious of painful convulsions.  
  
The next morning I woke up in my kitchen, surrounded by broken glass and blood.  Most of it was my own, cuts and other superficial wounds.  
  
I immediately panicked and wondered if what I had experienced had been real, and then immediately wondered if I had been slipped some sort of drug.  
  
I picked up my phone to call the police...  But hesitated.  
  
In my memory I could see my date from last night, and her rolled up eyes...  That same detached smile... It might seem horrific out of context, but there was something strangely beautiful about the memory all the same.  
  
I didn't call the police after all.  
  
I called Coinbase.  
  
Because in that moment, and every one afterwards I knew only one thing.  There was only one purpose to my life now, and the realization crept into me as a basic tenant of reality itself.  
  
I needed to buy bitcoins.  
  
I needed them badly.

I think biometrics could form a solid multisig 3 of 5 system combined with a mobile phone and a password.  
  
Key 1: Retina scan / fingerprint  
Key 2: Mobile phone  
Key 3: Password  
Key 4: Held in trust at a bank  
Key 5: Long-term deep storage key; not easily accessible by anyone, and only for emergencies.  
  
The idea is to have a system where you would basically need to kidnap the person to get access to their funds, but yet if they lost their phone and forgot their password they could still get in with the banks help.

What is this, I don't even...  I've never had another account.  
  
And your subreddit usually consists of two people: idiots who just discovered the stock market and think they will buy a few individual stocks and get rich soon (I was one a few years ago), or insufferable old idiots who throw their hands up and say "just buy index funds, no one can outperform the market!"   
  
Neither is exciting.   Both generate shitty conversation.  
  
Bitcoin is genuinely the next evolution of money, and the next five to ten years are going to annihilate and redefine how people view personal finance.  And when the next crash happens circa 2017ish, all the index fund tards are going to see the other side of that coin, and how in war and game theory there is no fire-and-forget solution.  
  
Buying index funds has only worked so long as the governments have been printing new money at an accelerating pace...  But that fantasy can't sustain itself forever.  
  
So congratulations for unbanning the word bitcoin, but the very nature of your attitude to money is counter productive to actually making vast sums of it.  
  
You act as if the proper course of action in investing is to do what the consensus and majority are doing... And that is bullocks.

Bitcoin has a clear and present fungibility problem that will only grow worse with time.  
  
This is self-evident with only two examples:  
  
(A) : when the community banded together to refuse any of the stolen coins from an exchange.  This may have seemed like the right thing to do, but what it actually did was show how in the future we may face network segregation when political and ideological concerns forbid tainted coins and coins originating in rival states.  Imagine Russia saying that all coins mined in the United States are illegal, or the EU declaring that all coins that have been used in black market transactions are tainted and subject to seizure by authorities.  
  
(B): the very existence of Satoshi coins makes bitcoin non-fungible.  How can you reasonably expect a token to serve as a global cash standard when if a certain large holder spends any of their coins, it would potentially crash the market because everyone would know instantly?  Imagine if Warren Buffet bought a coffee in the morning and caused a US Dollar crash that day because he was "cashing out".  
  
Both of these problems are a result of bitcoin's public blockchain.  
  
*Do not get me wrong*: **The world has need of a secure, public ledger and I expect Bitcoin to hold and grow in value for a long time.**  
  
But it is folly to expect that such a system fulfills all the requirements of a true digital cash system.  Lucky for us, we don't have to go back to fiat.  That isn't the answer.  
  
Beginning in 2014 a new Cryptonote standard was released.  This standard is technologically superior to bitcoin, but I do not believe that bitcoin need transition to it - we need a global public *and* private ledger.  Think of it like a poker game.... The best variants are played when all cards are not completely public (which would be impossible) or completely private (five card draw), but rather a mixture of the two (Hold 'em).  
  
For those who have read this far, your attention shall be rewarded.  Look into Monero for the best and largest implementation of the Cryptonote standard.

This is why we naturally evolved to believe in religion, or the "everything will be ok" principle.  This allowed us to accept our role as a fleeting speck of dust in the annals of history, even though the universe had no problem crunching us back into dust when our time came.  The problems arose when this religious "everything will be ok" philosophy began to impede with actual survival and preservation actions.

Thank you for an honest response.  
  
I guess the crux of the issue comes down to: if miners quit because they are unhappy with the return on transaction fees alone, will the other miners dive into the slack before the new weakness in the network translates to a loss of value?  Will this eventually create a grand equilibrium in price?  
  
Also, if many people are simply moving transactions around on a lightning network for cheap/free, then why would there be competition (creating significant fees) on the main blockchain?  Rather, it feels like an equilibrium will be reached between the desire to settle a transaction on the main blockchain vs. The cost of doing so and that cost will hover around a fixed number.  
@_date: 2015-10-05 01:43:29
I did read it, and found it painfully *one*-dimensional.  
  
Here's a summary of those arguments (or sides):  
  
-------------------  
  
*Side 1: Merchants will adopt Bitcoin because more customers hold Bitcoins*  
  
Merchants *can't* adopt bitcoin because it is crippled by a tiny transaction volume, so what will they do once another crypto (with better features and the ability to scale dynamically) starts to make significant network gains on Bitcoin?
  
--------------------  
  
*Side 2: Customers will adopt Bitcoin because more merchants accept Bitcoins*  
  
This is the most basic form of the network argument: customers will continue to use MySpace because lots of people use MySpace.  
  
-------------------------  
  
*Side 3: Developers will adopt Bitcoin because more customers and merchants use Bitcoins.   Note that in a complex regulated financial product like Bitcoin, this does not only relate to the applications existing, but reaching scale, going through trial-by-fire, proving their trustworthiness, gaining regulatory approval and so on.*  
  
More wishful thinking: "customers trust Blackberry phones and the existing user base makes it an unassailable force in the mobile world."  
  
Note that I didn't say bitcoin would die completely, but due to its public blockchain there are *entire classes* of applications that aren't possible on the bitcoin blockchain.  
  
You will see development continue for a while, and I would say bitcoin is a pretty safe spot for your crypto holdings, but to think that developers would develop for a clearly superior platform is silly.  Tell me this: if Android has more users, then why is their App Store a pale and shallow imitation of the iOS App store then?  Because developers don't necessarily develop where the most users are, but rather where there are the most profits to be made.  
  
-------------------------  
  
*Side 4:  All the parties in 1-3 adopting Bitcoin creates demand for the currency, causing its price to rise, making mining rewards more valuable, drawing miners and their computational power to the currency and therefore making the blockchain more secure against a fatal 51% attack.*  
  
What the fuck is this?  Yes, price is a function of popularity in a financial network (to some degree), but that isn't some extra 'side' you can just invoke.  This is retarded nonsense.  
  
With bitcoin there are little/no block rewards after a few more halvings so the bitcoin users better *hope* that their network grows extremely popular because otherwise they will see their network rapidly become worthless.  
  
A transaction-fee based system only works if the users are willing to pay significant transaction fees.  
  
Meanwhile Monero has a perpetual blocksize reward so there will always be new Monero to mine - once again, a better system that better rewards miners.  Why wouldn't miners choose a superior system?  
  
-------------------------  
  
*Side 5: Adoption by the ecosystem plus the security of a strong blockchain, draws pure financial investors to the currency, who push the price up, drawing more miners.*  
  
More nonsense.  That's like saying that because Facebook has a lot of stock holders nothing can ever supplant them.  And if you really do want to invoke this foolish argument then all it should take it one big price rise and speculatory rush and any blockchain (including Monero) would have a huge lead on taking down the  crypto.  
  
------------------------  
  
*Side 6:  More adoption plus better financial institutions ("Side 3") means more liquidity running through the exchanges that exchange Bitcoins back and forth to sovereign currency, which reduces the spreads to exchange into/out of the currency and making it more cost-effective for customers, merchants, developers and investors to use it.   (Spreads to sovereign currencies are the main transaction costs in any cryptocurrency, far outweighing the currencies internal transaction fees).*  
  
This is where the article writer goes full retard and doesn't just restate that because more people are using bitcoin, lots of people are using bitcoin.  No, he goes further and says that because lots of people are changing dollars into bitcoins, no one will ever want to change dollars directly into another crypto.  
  
Is his argument that the path of bitcoin is to play nice with the US Dollar?  
  
In short, this is a silly and absurd bit of make-believe from someone who understands very little about consumers, technology adoption (and disruption), and it likely to have the wind knocked out of him once the BTC-&gt;XMR rate begins to rapidly equalize.  
  
-----------------  
  
- Why would we ever develop a second religion once the first one was good enough?  
- Why would we ever develop a second dominant language on Earth if the first one was good enough?  
- Why would we have multiple social networks for various purposes if Facebook is the most popular?  
- PayPal is far more accepted than Bitcoin and already works with existing US Dollars.  By this person's idiotic logic, why would Bitcoin ever hope to displace PayPal's existing rails?

The 'problem' is not that I didn't read the article, it's that I read that article and many others.  Juno is a flawed concept built on a flawed concept, with the ultimate goal of JP Morgan retaining control over the money supply.  
  








  
(  
  
Permissioned ledger network?  So you mean a spreadsheet?  And then this gem, *"Once the election is complete the client side node issues a command to the Leader."*  Sybil attacks combatted with total centralization - pick one JP Morgan, because what you have built is a tangled mess of potential vulnerabilities.  
  
Perhaps the main problem is that they sent Ms. Blythe Masters to a Bitcoin startup on a sojourn to understand and learn about Bitcoin and she reported back with a tremendously foolish summary, that it was basically a fancy spreadsheet.  So naturally, based on her flawed analysis, they built a fancy spreadsheet.  
  
The fact that their code is on Githib is a good start and makes me think that maybe they want to play nice and get into the game proper.  So ok, let's start by hiring some really smart people to train everyone at your company on what a blockchain is, and what cryptography is, and how proof-of-work works.  As well, let's throw in some abstract money classes and courses on basic coding.  Let's get everyone there to understand exactly why proof-of-stake is deeply flawed, and get them to understand how the rules of an abstract game can influence its ability to grow later.  That's right, bankers need to start taking courses in game theory.  
  
Why?  Because anyone who has no interest in these subjects or can't grasp the rudimentary principals of them is dead weight and should be shown the door.  Otherwise JP Morgan will inevitably be replaced by a leaner, meaner, and smarter Silicon Valley startup.  
  
Does that sound absurd?  Welcome to the future, it's about to get even crazier.

**FL: Your fund was launched a few years ago. How many cryptocurrencies have entered the market during these years? Do you invest in anything, besides bitcoin?**  
  
AK: Yes, the other cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, have appeared after the first bitcoin “boom”. Their number was rising, but, to tell the truth, we were not interested in it at all. It was funny. It was something like pump-and-dump scheme. Technologically, we were only interested in Ethereum, yet we did not invest. Actually, after a more detailed assessment, I am in doubt that we will. We are also interested in Monero. Its creators, at least, have made a technologically real great thing that makes this project more valuable when compared to bitcoin. We like it. That’s all I guess.

JP Morgan is not commited to blockchain development.  By their actions it is clear they are most interested in subverting the idea and mechanics of a blockchain (which is impossible).  
  
If JP Morgan actually cared, and wanted to make a monster profitable move, they would acquire a %-stake of open-source blockchain projects like Bitcoin and Monero, and then commit $xxx million to development of these ecosystems.  
  
This would be a game changer: the realization by a major company that you can invest in an open-source project while also owning underlying shares of it.  But instead they want to fritter away their time on proprietary solutions which will fall woefully short of what their open-source peers can do.  
  
The best part is, if they did commit their capital to funding open-source development, they would find themselves in very lucrative positions to begin building the second layer of these projects ahead of their peers.  
  
But they don't want to establish a profitable stake in a future world-defining technology.  They want to figure out how they can keep controlling money... A goal that will leave them eventually broken and bankrupt once they finally realize the rest of the world has upgraded past their antiquated systems of control.

Bitcoin is amazing, secure, reliable, *public* money.  Stop trying to make it something it's not.  It will be the boss for things like colored coin purposes (Counterparty woot woot) and other applications where you don't mind (and possibly even want) a lot of others to see you moving your money.  
  
But true privacy and untraceability are not add-on features of digital cash, they are inherent features.  It's time to realize that more than one blockchain may be needed for humanity, each specializing in what it does best.

I will admit that Monero is not perfect, insomuch as no privacy system can be perfect.  
  
There will always be HUMINT errors and other factors that destroy your privacy, which luckily is how law enforcement will have to battle crime carried out on the latest generation of blockchains.  
  
As far as worrying that Monero's blockchain doesn't have enough volume to hide you, that's not how the ring signatures work.  They are effectively mixing with every transaction that has ever happened, so you can be pretty sure by this point in its history that plausible deniability can be achieved for practically any sum.  RingCT is coming soon and will make this even better, though admittedly there is a proposal to add it to Bitcoin as well - though in Monero's defense we already have hard fork plans to add it.  
  
Though Monero is not perfect, it is undoubtedly an order of magnitude better than the privacy Bitcoin uses, and doesn't ask users to jump through possibly broken hoops nor trust any outside party to secure their privacy.  
  
Eventually Monero may be replaced by an even more private blockchain, in which case I will heartily endorse it so long as the system isn't saddled with potentially game-breaking drawbacks.  I certainly won't say, "ehhh, we don't need that; we have good enough privacy."  
  
When we are talking about encoding transactions for all time on a ubiquitous ledger, there can never be a 'good enough' privacy - we must always be striving for better.

Waves is another sketchy as fuck ICO project, with value likely massively inflated by Bitcoin washing (into their own ICO).  The entire purpose of Waves is likely to extract as much value as possible from the crypto community, and then cash it out into lambos.  
  
This is not what legit crypto innovation looks like, and should not have this on its front page.

Yes, but my brand is worth way way more than that.  At this point, I don't think I have a realistic price to fuck-off from bitcoin anymore.  
  
I'm an international superstar who's about to become a best selling author (with a fantasy novel vaguely based around bitcoin) and I will have a Cryptocurrency created and launched based off me.  
  
I jerk off onto cold storage keys of 5 bitcoins on the reg bro.  Why?  
  
Because when you know you're about to wipe yourself with a tissue that has the sole private key to five bitcoins on it, you make that God damn orgasm count.  
  
Get on my fucking level.

Thank you for helping nail down exactly what my objections to this hard fork are.  
  
I feel that Ethereum is firmly broken on a technical and social level anyway, and this fork is just another way to wrap more broken corruption in an already fatally flawed system.  
  
Can Nick Szabo really still be repping this garbage?

The reality is in my own life I have been though periods of weak and genderless wandering, and guess how many quality women I attracted?   
  
I have also been ripped, successful, and confident.  Now guess what happened?  
  
There's not even a debate to be had.  I walked up to the hottest girl in the bar two nights ago, the blonde one with red lipstick that was being doted on by every man there.  
  
I told her hello, that I knew exactly what she was down underneath all that glitz and glamour, that I knew what she really needed, and that I was the only man in the whole place who she had any chance of getting it from.  
  
We spent the rest of the night in probably the most genuine conversation she's had in months, and we made fun of the chumps she walks all over on a regular basis.  
  
This is not an isolated incident, the pattern is clear: beautiful women who take the time to be feminine and attractive want a high status man who has rippling muscles and a powerful outlook.   
  
There is no debate.   
  
Who is Emma Watson dating?   
Why did millions of women buy 50 Shades of Grey?  
  
You can be mad about reality, but that doesn't make it less true.  If you don't want to play the dating game, or if you are a woman who wants to achieve your own success, more power to you.   
  
But red pill is about teaching young men to become a fortress of a man that others respect.  It's the father most of us who grew up in single-mother homes never had.  
  
It's the undoing of the notion that being a wimpy push over is the sure path to true love with a Disney Princess.  
  
Tl;dr: If you don't believe me or don't understand, I don't have any more time to explain it to you.

If they are trying to invest in open source blockchain projects and build second level solutions &amp; structures, then amazing!  Go Microsoft!  
  
If they want their own proprietary version of some permissioned ledger.... *le sigh*... Smh

What kills me is the guy is a certified genius; he is surely much smarter than me.  
  
So either I am wrong, and Ethereum really is the future (which seems nearly impossible with how corrupt and broken it is), he is mistaken (also seems unlikely), or.... 
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:31:31
Seriously shameful.  This is the next in a long line of ICO scam tokens, and they just used your company's name for a reputation boost, at the expense of your company.

Laughable.  
  
I know I try to make known the transparency risks of Bitcoin here, but this community should also know I stand behind the morality and ethics that have been displayed by the Bitcoin community.  
  
I know that if I mine or buy a Bitcoin, or honestly *however* I acquire it, that Bitcoin is technically mine.  The code really is law: possess a private key, and that Bitcoin is yours to do with as you please.  No one can take it from you by force.  They can socially and legally take it from you, but Bitcoin's code and ledger are truly immutable.  
  
That's why it's the gold standard for all crypto, and Ethereum will eventually collapse into the controlled demolition footprint that it is wiring for itself.

Erik, seriously.  You are smart enough to see how Ethereum has subverted the ideals of what a blockchain should be from the very start.  First the token pre-sale was absurd; did Satoshi ever try to presale Bitcoin?  Second, the laughable Dev switch that will change proof-of-work to proof-of-stake solely in the hands of a small cabal?  Come on man!  This is exactly the sort of self-interested power we were supposed to be getting away from!  And finally this insane hard fork...  
  
Yes the price is going up, likely due to major financial players rushing to be part of the 'next big thing'.  What baffles me is how smart minds like yours can see Ethereum and not immediately write it off as a joke.  Maybe it's a joke that everyone believes in, but that doesn't make it true.  
  
If you are looking for a post-Bitcoin project, there are much more worthy blockchains out there.

That's the worst thing I've ever heard.  
  
If I have 1000 bitcoins, of course I'm not going to be able to sell them locally.  
  
That's what an exchange is supposed to do.  
  
If an exchange can't allow me to sell my asset efficiently, something is either very wrong with the exchange or the asset.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:01:54
I don't own bitcoins; explain it to me like I'm 5, please.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:00:57
You're going to have to clarify.  
  
If I have 1000 bitcoins and want to sell them all today, and eventually convert them back to USD... are you saying I can sell them all today?  And then withdraw my dollars slowly, confident that the exchange has my dollars held in trust?

+100 doge
Very well written, except no mention of Dogecoin in the article.  
  
So sad.  Despite being based on a joke, Dogecoin's market cap is set that at maturity it will be far better suited for casual acceptance than any fraction of another coin.  People like integers, and Dogecoin is better suited to be able to handle that.    
  
Also, with 60 second confirmations it is much easier to use to pay for goods and services.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:41:36
Umm... isn't that the same as any major financial scam?  
  
*Let them buy in.  Give them massive returns.*  
*No.*  
*You can't withdraw.  Why would you want to?*  
  
If I am wrong, or there's something I don't understand: please, enlighten me.
