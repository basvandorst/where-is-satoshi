Bitcoin wins.. than now a correction will come soon. Money flow back in alts.  This ramup was all because of psych.. 2x gains and such.  Drop to 5k soon.. than up from there.

I would look at what the average btc price does in the next 9 days.. if it keeps going up... wait for the low 7..ish. if it does not.. wait some more. But you could also buy alts. Convert to btc when it is low.

Big stuff like that.. yes pretty much. Every time ppl say it will never drop again. 75 % of the it does. In the btc chart if you zoom out it is obvious we are a bit overextended. 
It all depends on news also.. but the correction always happens its obvious in the charts. If we dont go back to 8k in the next few days. Than btc will drop  a nice amount. Thats just how the market works.
If because of the news new ppl come in and everyone gets bullish we might go to 8500
. And not retrace lower than 6k but i doubt it. Holidays are coming up..money will go there ;)
Its my opinion..might be wrong.. could always be. Just telling how i see it. Btc doubled in a short amount of time that is not something to take lightly. But no reason to get such an attitude.
You could have just sayd .. i dont think it will correct.. thats just fine. Time will tell.

And here we go ;)

No on knows.. really ..but if you zoom out the btc chart and you will see we are due for a correction / profit taking.
 
Somewhere between now and end of the year is my guess.  
Maybe set some buy orders between 5000 and 6500 if you dont want to check it every day .

Wait for the retracement. Will go back to 5200$ for sure. Maybe lower.

This is normal..average still going down. But its getting slower and slower.  Think around 6k really will be the bottom.
