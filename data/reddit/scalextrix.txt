Im just powering down until my original stake is reclaimed, the rest is gravy

I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be the solution not the perpetuation of the same old problems

The point of Gridcoin is efficiency.
Bitcoin uses all that energy to secure the network = its not needless, its doing work.
Gridcoin uses a large amount of energy too = substitutable work to Bitcoin + doing other valuable things = more efficient.
Or put it another way
1xWh = Bitcoin
1xWh = Gridcoin + the scientific advancement of humanity

But the problem is Bitcoin cant do any useful work except run the network, Gridcoin does useful work by incentivising BOINC projects.

I agree, also humans negotiate agreements so the outcomes arent always rational.
I think what will be needed is a clause library with the smart contract code linked behind it:
Buyer pays after delivery, add code lump X
Seller gives buyer 24 hours to check deliverables for quality, add code lump Y
If Buyer does not reject after 24 hours execute payment, code lump Z

Its a problem today and it will be a problem tomorrow.  However one way smart contracts could help is collateral, I didnt get to see it work yet but in the new Sia contracts the host and renter both have to place an amount of colatteral onto the contract which they only get back once its fully executed.  This motivates everyone to behave a little better.

There are great reasons to invest in alts if you choose them wisely, Gridcoin is searching for cures to diseases (Im up 10x btw) and Solarcoin is incentivising solar power production (Im up 5x btw).
These are examples of serious endeavours to produce real value, not just pump n dump clones.

Gridcoin is not centralised, it runs on DPoR (Distributed Proof of Research).

The failure of understanding in those links is that BOINC is not a single central authority, there are a collection of unrelated projects who are ambivalent about Gridcoin and it's value. New projects can come on and old projects can be retired.
Voting is on blockchain and is decentralised.
There are more BOINC projects on Gridcoin than there are major centralised pools on Bitcoin, 
I'm not in this forum for an argument.  Gridcoin has value.

So we have to disagree friend, but that is OK. I respect your skepticism.
If you can please participate in BOINC and help advance science, if you dont want to earn Gridcoin for it that's entirely optional.

Well I'm in the Gridcoin camp, use the processing power to do something socially valuable, and secure the currency.

Yes interesting, your last point brings the Red Queen Hypothesis to mind; ultimately this is why PoW is so wasteful.
