The protocol defines a "feefilter" message (BIP 133), which basically lets nodes signal the minimum fee rate of a tx they are willing to relay. Technically that can go as low as 0.001 sat/b.
Right now the few nodes i connect to all signal 1 sat/b feefilter, never saw it go lower than that.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:24:12
Huh? That does not sound right - things are down to 50 sat/b now.

Assuming "comcast" is a monopoly ISP, then nope. ISPs have monopolies because there is no choice - only one cable goes into your town/apartment block/etc.

@_date: 2018-01-20 04:31:47
Nothing really to link, just an observation i was making.
There are nodes on the network that don't follow the "drop in two weeks" recommendation, and they keep rebroadcasting transactions that should have been dropped. Other nodes that did drop it are not keeping track of what they dropped, so they just see a new transaction and add it to their pool for the next two weeks.
It's like cancer - as long as there is one cell remaining somewhere, it will grow back again.
On the rest of the questions - a transaction is signed by your device/software and is broadcast, once, to the network. Each network node receiving it broadcasts it to all nodes it is connected to. This way the transaction is spread across the whole 100k nodes or so network in seconds. After that, there is no need to continue broacasting, having your software open or even having the keys.
Still, occasionally transactions that sat around for a month or two will get dropped for good, despite the retransmissions i mentioned earlier, so to guard agains that you need to do what i described in another post below.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:17:36
Increase. Blocks are coming out too fast now.
Odds are we are not going to see mempool zero any time soon - at worst, the interest in Bitcoin would have to wane, at best LN would have to grow popular enough to matter.
Does not necessarily mean that fees would stay at $4 for long - it can plausible chew through the top layers all the way down to the bulk of &lt;40 sat/b transactions, dropping the fees to about $1.5. But anything better would need popular LN.
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:26:20
What i am more curious about is how do they sell it on their end without invoking the high fees? It's been about $8 per tx for most of the last two month, did they just absorb that? Or have people there worked around that somehow?
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:44:00

For one, measuring value with market cap is like measuring length in default snakes. It's not an informative measure.
For two, this is not a USA thing, but a worldwide thing. As such it can plausibly exceed in value any single local thing out there.
For three, value is derived from usage and utility. So far Bitcoin is barely used on the worldwide scale, less than 0.00001% of all transactions are done in Bitcoin. Get it a million times more popular, and it can easily grow 10 or 100 times more.

That's not FUD, btw. You do need to monitor channels real-time for cheating, and apps running on a phone are not likely to have permanent connectivity and uptime needed for that.

@_date: 2018-01-19 12:30:36
Yeah, the basically switched Bitcoin to use Equihash as PoW, as well as making difficulty adjust every block and making the Segwit signature digest default for all transactions (not the same as having segwit mandatory).
In theory this was supposed to help against mining centralization. In practice there are no incentives for anyone to switch over.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:29:24

@_date: 2018-01-15 03:54:23
Oh, and have you noticed that the new signature digest SegWit uses, which is the hardest part to implement, is also what they use in Bcash? So adding Bcash support would require doing 95% of work needed for Segwit... and yet many exchanges and wallets did the former but not the latter. Fun.
But honestly, i don't think the "one day" is really a good metric - in production most of the time would be spent testing and reviewing, not implementing.

More or less on point - any blockchain that sees no use is fast/cheap, every blockchain that is widely used is clogged/expensive.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:20:28
Here is the real graph, the lower one: 
So you can get away with 80 sat/b (60 sat/b segwit) for 50/50 odds of next block, but if you really want to be sure, you need about 120.
However, these can disappear more or less instantly if the usage goes up - as usual, fee requirements are very probabilistic.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:46:54
Pretty much. It's a payment routing network which allows a lot of transactions (ideally, all the small ones) to be aggregated into one or two settlement ones.
And since the size of these settlement txs does not depend on how many transactions were routed via the channel, it can scale indefinitely.

Yep, but this can easily fit into a causal loop kind of time travel (the kind possible in GR), while going back and buying coins from someone makes it much harder to get a consistent loop (that is, one without altering how the history looks like to the time traveler at departure - you would have to look up who to buy from in the latter case, but once you do it won't appear for sale anymore, causing a feedback paradox).

Imagine that they didn't, and instead used lower fees. But then, someone *else* dropped some high fee transaction on top. Now they have their tranasctions buried and have to wait an indefinite amount of time.
A fee is a marker of priority. If you want good odds of your transaction coming through, you got to pay a premium. If you can afford to wait, then you pay close to what is the current minimum level.

Give it a month or two. I'd guess Feb 28th.
They got about 40k transactions a day on Voldemortcoin network, at the typical LN fee of 1sat per transaction that adds up to about $5 of fees for the same day's worth of transactions on LN vs about $20000 of fees on their chain.
If they were to use their full capacity, then that would be $500 of fees on LN vs $2 million of fees on their network. And their fees would start to go up at this point, while LN would still be an infant.

Another change is that they use SegWit style signature digest for transactions. That provides replay protection and completely removes backwards compatibility with older software - you need to redo the transaction signing if you want your wallet to support it. Not really a bad thing, since you'd implement this anyway to support SegWit, but it's still a curious tidbit.

None. You can close the channel at any time without the other's side cooperation if needed, and open a new channel to another node.
Also, since passing LN txes require signing by a hot wallet, the larger the node is the more it stands to lose. Scale is a liability, not a benefit there.

FIBRE network - 
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:05:48
Not really. 
For one, the nodes are hot wallets, so the more you keep in one the higher is the risk of loss, disincentivizing large nodes.
For two, the network is equiconnected. It's not like ISPs in USA where you have monopolies and no choice, but rather you can pick whatever node you like and route via any node you like at no extra cost. So as soon as a node goes rogue the payments would instantly get re-routed around it. You don't get to hold any power (censorship ability or price monopoly) over the network just by being big and/or wealthy.
So being a big, well connected node is a liability, not power.

Not really - transactions keep gtetting rebroadcast, so the nodes that follow the "drop in two weeks" rule can't really drop it for good.
In any case, even you you don't have the keys you can just write down the already-signed transaction from mempool for safekeeping, and then broadcast it again when the fees drop down.

If you are worried, then go to blockchain.info's page of your transaction, append ?format=hex to the address (i.e.  ), and write down what you get.
This is the raw, signed transaction. If it gets dropped, then once the fees go down you can broadcast it again, without needing to have the keys (i.e. on  ).

It will be a separate network of nodes, probably with a lot of them co-existing with existing BTC nodes.
LN channels are opened between the nodes, which consists of signing a transaction that would split the balance between the two endpoints in a proportion they committed funds to it. On network level, it's a (re-openable) TCP connection between these new nodes, and a commitment output TX on the blockchain.
After that, exchanging funds over the channel means sending signed transactions with the new re-distribution. To close the channel, you broadcast the last tx in the series to the blockchain.
That's the gist of it.

The "not safe" parts are echoes of propaganda from the Scaling War of 2015-2017. Segwit was extensively tested over years before deployment and had been operational for almost two years under the full adversarial load of Bitcoin with no issues.
As to whether it's worth transferring to the new format, it depends. If you have well established cold storage of a significant value, then the main risk is making some mistake in the process or in re-securing the new keys. If you have a hot wallet with spending money, then it's quite worth the trouble since there is a noticeable fee reduction.

@_date: 2019-07-05 05:05:28
It's a question of scale, basically. Right now Bitcoin is so cheap big players could easily buy and sell enough to move the price, it's still being emitted pushing the price down slowly, and it's still early in it's adoption, with demand pushing the price up rather fast.
In the long term success scenario there will no longer be any significant emission, the value would be large enough to resist manipulation, and adoption would be complete enough to stop the up going pressure.
Thus, the value would stay relatively stable at the scale of decades.

Oh? Even if it is stimulating the development of renewables? Mining seeks the cheapest energy, and there is no cheaper energy than energy that would have been wasted when generation exceeds consumption.


Everything does, by that logic. The error is thinking that it's the energy consumption that is at fault, while the real problem is the energy generation.

Makes Lightning network practical. It can work on a non-segwit coin, but you have to be online 24/7 to monitor the chain for channel shenanigans. With Segwit you can safely outsource the monitoring.

No, only the total will end up on the blockchain. Each transfer across a channel is a basically a signed Bitcoin transaction with an updated balance of both sides spending the funding transaction, that is NOT broadcast in operation. These could be generated indefinitely. Once you close the channel you broadcast the last one of them, so all the transactions over the channel effectively get aggregated into it.
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:52:15
Think about it as massive aggregation. You send to the stand, they send to the candy store, candy store sends rent to the owner, etc, all over the channels.

What about connectivity in the "being a hub" scenario? Would going offline at the wrong time screw up transactions in process of being routed through it?
What about going offline making it impossible to use the funds on channels open with you? Sure, they can recover via closing and opening, but that would make people trust your node less.

There is no hard maximum. The fee needed depends on network usage, which is not predictable. The USA is about to wake up now, if a lot of people would rush to do transactions then the system would get clogged again, and can stay so for a long time. Or it might be that no one would do anything on the holidays, and the tx would get confirmed instantly due to the lack of load. The more you pay, the higher is your tx's priority.
It's like looking at traffic in the city, finding an empty route and going via it, only to find yourself in a jam because everyone else looked at the same app, found the same empty street and went there.

Yep, talked of by BRD, not developers or community at large.
There are many advantages and no disadvantages to segwit and bech32 address format, so it's getting pushed and adopted by many. However, the fundamental part about things Bitcoin is that you don't break backwards compatibility - there is no "making it obsolete" in a sense of no one being able to use it any more.
To "force" people to use segwit you would have to make P2PKH outputs invalid. That would take a hardfork.
In fact, that's exactly what Bcash did - after the fork the old transaction format no longer worked, and you could only use segwit-style signature digest moving forward. This was necessary, however, for the sake of replay protection.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:07:43
I get it. As was confirmed above, many people don't want to implements several updates in a row, but rather wait for the bech32 addresses to get popular enough to enable. 
I was submitting it the same way as the old ones - inv to nodes, they send getdata and receive a tx. Many nodes were returning format/validation errors.
Hm, haven't occured to me to check the versions... Nice catch. Double-checked now, a few of the bad ones were something like "/BitcoinUnlimited:1.0.2(EB16; AD12)/", so duh, but one is "/Satoshi:0.15.0.1/". Some good ones are "/Satoshi:0.15.0/".

There is never a minimum, just a choice of how long you are willing to wait.
Things have quieted down at the moment, so you can get away with low-ish fees compared to what it was a few days ago - 
Something around 150 sat/b got a good change of getting confirmed withing the hour, which is about 0.3 mBTC, or $4.

In general i would have agreed, but my expectation of a drop is based on :
A. Bitcoin not having large enough on ramps for people to just go and buy it in a rush. You can buy USD OTC on any corner in a mall, you can buy gold bars and coins OTC in any large bank branch, you still need weeks or months of approvals and bank transfers to buy Bitcoin if you aren't already set to do it.
B. Bitcoin not having enough of an established general trust for people to put their money into during a scary time. People won't be rational and doing research. They would see their savings lose half of it's value overnight and scramble to shove it into something safe ASAP, and the "drug money", "it crashed last year", "it's volatile", etc, Bitcoin won't be that.
I also expect a lot of speculants to sell off in a panic early on, crashing the price and amplifying B in a feedback loop.
Now, middle to long term it's likely to go up, and even go up a lot as people would see it's solidity *in hindsight*.

It's the cost of having to maintain the compatibility with existent environment. The system itself is fairly starightforward, even more so that the original one, but needing to support both makes things tricky.
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:45:24
Fragile, one way and likely to do more harm than good. Basically the side where the satellite's ground station is would either be constantly invalidating the other sides or be ignored by them, depending on how the hash rate split up.
The problem is not so much in how to bridge, but rather that any prolonged large scale network split would result in a chain wipeout of one side on reconnection. Attempting to bridge might create unstable links, which would make the wipeouts periodic rather than a one off. Even one wipeout would kill all trust in Bitcoin, since it would basically revert all trades and transactions in a macroregion.
Realistically, in such a scenario the only stable fix would be to hard fork, making the chains incompatible and unable to damage each other.
Political carnage?
A, with Trump in charge there will be applause instead of carnage. Fighting the digital immigrants and loss of digital jobs to outsources, you know the tune.

Centralization risk. The higher are the requirements to run a full node, the rarer the nodes become.

Perhaps, however it is still a big centralization risk - it's important not to increase the block size faster than average non-first-world computer speed and internet acces grow, or nodes would start dropping out of the network.


I thought the problem with sharding was that it's orders of magnitude more complexity which still produces an inherrently fragile system? So having a complex potential flop like LN sit above a solid foundation of Bitcoin is a much better bet than having a complex potential flop being the foundation itself.


Is there any unbiased write-up on that? From what i can see myself they still cover the signature by txid, which makes transactions malleable and make delegated channel monitoring impossible, requiring users to be online 24/7 to keep the channels honest.

Not really - Bcash can only scale linearly (one transfer per on-chain transaction), while solving the fee problem needs exponential scaling (multiple transfers per one on-chain transaction), which is only doable by distributing the load with a second layer.

You know that. The bulk of people have no idea and expect to only be able to buy it via Coinbase or equivalent, with alternatives being shady drug deal style things with cash in the mall parking lot.


Also, most people are yet to grasp the "not your keys, not your Bitcoin" concept. They store "their" coins on exchanges and custodial wallets. Plenty of these won't survive a crash, once again amplifying B.
People are always prepared for the last decade's crash, they would only understand all of the above en masse after the next one, not during it.


I hesitate to try to predict anything about what would be going on during a crash THAT big. This is a "millions die, billions jobless, trillions of (today's) USD worth of damage" kind of a doomsday scenario that might very well wreck Bitcoin as well (internet fragmentation and massive outages).
My hopes are on a smaller calamity happening first, to help ease the world off USD and give it time and sense of urgency to build up enough new infrastructure to weather the total collapse.


Played with it since 2010, but haven't taken it seriously until 2016.

No volume is likely to be produced - futures trading is betting on which way Bitcoin would go, and does not involve any actual Bitcoin being bought or sold anywhere.

Don't expect it to be done in half an hour, however. The entire point of a full node is to verify the whole chain, and that takes much longer than just transfer time. You'd still be looking at days of sync time.

Skeleton in the sense that it got just enough code to sync blocks and receive transactions, verify most rules, index everything and be able to compose and broadcast blocks and transactions on request.
I agree, calling it a full node isn't really correct since it does not contribute back to the network, but it's good enough for independent verification, analytics and experiments. No idea what's a better name for something like that.

It's a separate facet of the bug - basically it's possible to produce a double spend in the same transaction in a carefully crafted fashion that wouldn't crash the node, thus bypassing the check in question.

Yeah, i'm also confused by the whole "Core can take as much time as they want implementing SegWit. Can't rush security related software. But Bitcoin companies must rush and aren't allow to take their due time." argument, more so now that i actually took a good bite into it.
@_date: 2018-09-27 08:16:43
That's disinformation on many levels.
The bug is in the block verification code and spans versions that are post-segwit already. The fix for it is a few lines of code that make the verification more correct, there is no other differences to a 0.16.2 node. There is no way it can force you to do or not do anything.
The fix is also available for every affected major version - 0.14 and 0.15 branches. Segwit was added in 0.13 branch, which itself is not affected. So, any node old enough to not have segwit also does not have the bug.
On the second piece of disinfo there, segwit can't be forced on you. It's a new transaction format that exists on it's own, and the old style transactions *are still supported and would always be*. That's the whole point of it being a soft fork. You can avoid it with any node version by simply not using it.
On the third piece of disinfo, segwit is not something you need to avoid. But that's a whole other discussion.
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:54:37
AFAIK the reindexing does not require any download unless you run a pruned node (if your data directory is hundreds of Gb, then you aren't), it would just go through the already downloaded chain and build an index of all transactions.

Nope, all it would take is a prolonged internet fragmentation. Disconnect USA from the rest of the world for a day, reconnect, and there will be carnage. Break the internet into several large blocks, and Bitcoin is going to be set back years, if it ever recovers.
A global consensus network can only work if there is a single instance of globality.
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:57:10
@_date: 2018-09-27 07:20:33
Not too high - the cost of the attack is mining one block, which will ultimately be deemed invalid. The result, by now, is some chaos and temporary value drop. Cashing out the double spent coins would be difficult, since you don't know which exchanges, if any, are still unpatched. The attack would be very obvious and unless it's highly anonymous, it would be tracked back and burn your reputation, if not more.
So, it would cost 12.5 BTC and odds of keeping the gains are low.

The actual size as of today is 197 Gb, including all the indexes. Expect it to grow at up to 100 Gb per year.
If you are using it as a wallet, make sure the machine is secure and you got a firewall (i.e. a router) between it and the raw internet.
For LN node, you will benefit from having an ability to receive incoming connections (open port 9735). Your node should be online most of the time to be a good routing target for others.
Be aware that having a node makes you a target in some places. If Bitcoin is banned in your country, don't run a node without a VPN.

That would be unusably bad. If you can't pay less than a dollar and fees are in the hundreds, it's no longer usable for anything.
And i don't see a hardfork to increase the resolution ever happening.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:39:16
Hm, if LN fails, how would having larger blocks alone help? Increase the block size 10x, popularity increases 10x, and you get the same fee problem - it does not fundamentally solve anything.
On the other hand, if LN works, then increasing the block size 10x would get the fees down, since the increase of popularity would flow into LN.
Which is why it seems to me that using LTC and other LN-compatible chains make more sense in the short term for evening out the load, while BTC is taking a shot at scaling with LN, new signature schemes and so on.
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:23:50
I still don't get how UASF was relevant in any way. I remember doing the thing - install the node software that would reject blocks that don't signal bit 1. I also remember that only a few percent of nodes did that, none of which were of any mining or economical significance.
And as far as i understand things, the net result on Aug 1 2017 would have been that these few percent of nodes would have forked off and seized up for lack of hashpower, while the larger honeybadger of Bitcoin would have continued on without caring.
How was that supposed to have any effect on the Segwith activation back then?
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:26:01
It absolutely did work... Months ago, when it first came up, and i don't quite remember how it went back then.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:36:00
Not talking about Bitcoin vs Bcash, that's a long-closed and obvious part.
What i mean is the notion that a few percent of UASF nodes can claim they forced a change when all they did were setting themselves on a suicide course that isn't even a kamikaze one.
If there was a large percentage, that would have constituted a bluff capable of delivering the carnage. If there was a supermajority, it would have been plain consensus. But a few percent of random nodes is just noise.
Pretending that this noise was relevant is disinformative in the same spirit as the kinds of FUD people shoot down here is.
@_date: 2018-08-03 01:16:59
Okay, that's pure BS.
Specifically, UASF was only supposed to enforce signalling of bit 1, from which it would have taken weeks before actual segwit activation.
By the point the fork happens it would be a classic Satoshi consensus - longest chain wins. Meaning that either more than half the miners switch to mine the UASF chain and the old chain dies, or the UASF chain dies with near-zero miners on it. It's a metastable fork that can not last and would have been disastrous if there were more than a few percent of UASF nodes.
So if 3 happened, then the UASF chain would have been effectively stillborn. It didn't have EDA like bcash, so it would have taken months before a difficulty adjustment and/or segwit activation.
Also, if you consider 5 plausible, then you have zero understanding of what things are and what everyone's agendas were.

There is such a thing as a change of mind. Sometimes as we age we get smarter, happen to do the research, realise our past mistakes. Ideally, any opinion you acquired more than two years ago must be held suspect and open to review.

Hm, i was thinking more about long term wealth preservation than any sort of immediate utility in a crisis. Bitcoin is built on top of a new and rather fragile infrastructure, which can conceivably be rendered inoperable by events far less than a worldwide disaster. 
Simple one can be near-war tensions permanently fragmenting the internet across many blocks and borders. A bit less likely would be the backdoors in modern CPUs leaking and being used to destroy a large portion of computers, also fragmenting the internet as well as killing the majority of nodes. A different sort of an event would be a CME strong enough to knock out the power for a large fraction of the world.
In many scenarios we have technological regress and/or economic collapse without necessarily having a shortage of food and water, followed by a recovery. Once things get back to normal, Bitcoin would be a thing of a past or a bunch of half-dead forks of questionable value and utility, while gold would maintain something close to it's previous value.

Funny thing is to try to look at it from an outsider perspective.
Take Uber, for example. For most people a taxi is an emergency service. You need to get to the airport at 3 AM. You need to get home after your car broke down. You need to get somewhere quickly but you just finished the fifth beer.
So you look at Uber and see random people playing a game on a cellphone. Would a random person playing a game be playing it at 3 AM? Certainly not. Would a random person playing a game arrive where you are in a timely manner and would know how to get to where you need to go? Of course not. After all they are not taxis, they are not professionals who were screened and trained to go this job. And thus your natural conclusion would be that Uber is some weird and useless fad.
Now try looking the same way at cash and Bitcoin. For most people money just work and got a government behind it, while Bitcoin is some useless fluff on the internet.
TL;DR: There is still a long road ahead...

Sadly, i'm not making this up. I've used Monero before, and still use it occasionally. It's far from being a shitcoin.

There is a company called Blockstream which rents bandwidth on several TV broadcast satellites and use it to broadcast Bitcoin blocks.

Downside is that they only broadcast the last 24 hours of blocks, so you still need to do the initial sync normally.

@_date: 2019-03-10 17:05:27


That's not entirely correct:
A. You are still a contributing part of the network if you don't allow incoming connections, only difference is that other nodes won't be able to initiate a connection to you. Otherwise the data exchange remains the same.
B. Your IP still gets broadcast each time your node connects to a peer, regardless of whether you can receive incoming connections or not. You need to explicitly forbid this in your node config.
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:07:26


Pretty much. It's main goal is to cut out the large bandwidth taken by blocks, letting people with slow or capped internet connections run full nodes.
You would still want to have a regular connection, however, to be able to broadcast transactions and to cross-check the stream against the rest of the network (headers are enough to do this) to avoid relying on a central point of failure (the satellitte's node).
AFAIK there is no significant lag.
LN does expose your IP in a similar fashion to a full node, and it's a bit more constraining at the moment since incoming channels are tied to that IP. You'd want a VPN or Tor to run that if you want to receive or route payments.

PSA: Never YOLO a Bitcoin transaction.
If you got a twinge of worry whether you got it right or not, don't go "eh, she'll be right" instead of checking it carefully one more time. Otherwise you might end up staring at a block explorer with a silent rage as money burn in front of your eyes.
Never YOLO a Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:27:04
The key word is static. In Bitcoin proper the backup is a seed you write down, put away and can used a hundred transactions later. With LN a backup had to be updated after each transaction as it is now, similar to the early Bitcoin client, necessitating cloud storage and similar solutions.
A static backup is something you write down and put away that would let you recover the channel funds even in case of a total data loss (i.e. phone flushed down the toilet). It turned out to be tricky to make, however.
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:22:50
One option would be to be paid in Bitcoin first, then spend. In that case an exchange would open a channel to you from their side (which they can do cheaply in bulk), and then you get paid over this channel and so can pay out.
Not sure about reverse liquidity opening like you described - it's not possible to do non-custodially in the current network and i'm unfamiliar with the more recent proposals. The keys could be rotated, but it would still likely require some degree of trust.
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:27:04
Sitting in USD? Are you expecting a crash to happen really soon?
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:43:57
You don't really need to close channels to cash out, especially when you have so many of them - there are services that would send you onchain BTC for LN payment. As a bonus you get to rebalance the routing channels while doing so.
I suspect a lot of channel closures are actually due to various compatibility issues and trigger-happy failsafes - i had channels close over things like fee disagreements and other node announcing channels earlier than mine expected it. The last update also screwed something up in their db handling, so i had several channels get closed over missing HTLC records.
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:30:48
Ideally, closing is not going to be needed outside of emergencies. 
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:50:49

@_date: 2018-10-02 14:55:49
It's live on mainnet and works well enough that you won't lose funds, but not well enough to be really practical.
On mobile wallet side the big waiting item is watchtowers - a way to ensure fraud-free channel operations without being constantly online. Many are waiting for them before adding support.
On the general scale, the big issue is reliability - while there are no fund loss, the amount of unsuccessful transactions is still pretty high, and there are some rather painful edge cases where HTLCs get stuck for days. In other words, when it works it works beautifully, but when it doesn't it can get ugly. This is a big obstacle for the "streaming money" use cases, i.e. things like paying 1 sat per every meter of scrolling on Reddit - 99 out of 100 transactions succeeding and one getting seriously stuck is not good enough there.

Gold is useful for many non-monetary things and is certain to remain valuable until space mining or something similar would make it less rare.
Also, gold is still a good store of value for cases of hard disasters - for all the advantages of Bitcoin it needs a functioning worldwide internet, and that is rather fragile.

Checking the key does not need hashing power, it needs elliptic curve operations.
A typical desktop CPU with a naive imple3mentation can do a 1000 of these per second. A well-optimized GPU solution can do several dozen millions per second.
A typical Ethereum farm out of 2000 GPUs would then be able to do about 80 Ga/s, only 10^11 guesses per second.
That does not even count the complexity of having to check for every derived address's balance, which would slow down the thing a lot.
In other words, mining is more profitable than this.

There are certain anti-spam features, requiring minimum output sizes, proportion of transferred values to fees and so on. I can't name all of them off the top of my head, but summarily they add up to spam cost scaling with volume, so the cost of a full-DoS attack would be at around 1-2 BTC per block.

What is the right way to do it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:34:20
One observation - a challenge is often not an attack.
The best way of making sense of a confusing notion is to challenge it, which would prompt it's proponents into describing it in details and addressing perceived weaknesses and issues. The side effect of such an approach is that it tends to offend people. Someone who is already attacked by society all the time would not react well to being questioned like this. But in technical and scientific areas this is fairly typical.
So, try to be aware of this and don't take challenges personally.

All it takes is a popular wallet adding a double spend option as a default. Suddenly 5% of all "0-conf" transactions become double spends, because why won't you use a wallet that have a 5% chance of successful double spend.
Which is why calling a signed transaction in mempool a zero-conf transaction is misleading. On the other hand, LN HTLCs are the real zero-conf transactions, since they are secure in a hostile environment.
This is not a geek club where everyone is honest, this is cryptocurrencies - in plain english, money in adversarial environment.

Well, alts don't just go down all the time. They do tend to be attached to Bitcoin by a rubber band - Bitcoin goes up, and some time later the alts that are still alive would follow, and a few would overshoot - most alts have majority of their trading volume in pairs with BTC.
Your real mistake wasn't just diversifying into alts, but doing it indiscriminately.
It's worth investing in ones that have utility, tech and/or developers behind them. Ethereum, Storj, Zcash, Monero, maybe Steem and Dash and a couple others.
I've been diversifying in the same way for a couple of years, and am at 3x the amount of BTC equivalent i put in over that time. Several of the alts combusted, but a core few with good tech kept going up. More interestingly, i'm also down about 30% if you count since May.
So, i can only advice to hold on and not sell at a loss - several ones on your list got a good chance to go up big time, and most of them would rubber-band up once Bitcoin stops growing.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:21:38
Magnitude scale. An increase of $5 is huge when the price is $10, small when it's $100 and minute when it's $1000. On a regular chart, that $5 increase would always look the same. On the logarithmic scale that $5 around $10 price would look exactly like $500 around $1000 price.
That is, on a linear scale the notches are 1, 2, 3, 4 ..., while on the logarithmic they are 1, 10, 100, 1000, ...

Right now the difficulty is too high for the price, you can make 2x as much mining BTC than mining BCH. So redirecting their hashpower to the BCH would result in a net loss, and neither would renting hashpower to mine it pay for itself since it's priced relative to BTC mining cost.

This does not look like spam - the cheap, bulk transactions are stuff like payouts to miners, wallet conglomerations and so on.
You typically see them every now and then when mempool is empty and they can be done at the cheapest rates.

They might be optional, but when you have more transactions that can fit into a block, the ones with highest fees go i first. Same if you want the money sent in 10 minutes instead of,say, a day.
There is also a mandatory minimum fee of 1000 satoshis (0.00001 BTC), which equals a minimum of about 0.02 BTC bonus to a miner. Not much now, can be a lot later.

"Store of value" tends to only be defined on the time scales of many years, and on that timescale Bitcoin have been smoothly growing in value at a rate of 330% a year over the decade. We have just recently emerged from a speculative bubble, so the price still trends downwards a bit.

In short, to own Bitcoins you need to own private keys. Each key is a 64-digit hexadecimal number, corresponding to one or two public keys (addresses). The Bitcoins you own is the sum of all transaction outputs assigned to the addresses to which you hold the private keys.
A Bitcoin wallet (better called a Bitcoin keyring, but the "wallet" name stuck) is a program that manages your keys and uses them to sign transactions. A hardware wallet is a device that does the same. An online wallet is a site that you type the private key into and it would generate transactions from it. An exchange is like a bank that gives you an IOU for your Bitcoins, and secures them on their own.
If that makes sense to you and you intend to hold on to the Bitcoins for a while, use a wallet like Electrum or a hardware wallet like Trezor. For the former, make sure the PC you use it on is secure (if it got Windows on it and you don't have a couple of decades of admin experience, then it's not).

So? To get to an ATH bitcoin would have to be in a bubble or close to one, and bubbles in bitcoin tend to happen on average every 1.5 years.

Good. An HD wallet is a seed from which all the addresses are generated, and if there were many, then it might not realise that it needs to generate more if there are gaps in their use.
Try generating a dozen new addresses. If funds start to appear, keep going until all are there.
If this still does not help, try doing a zapwallet and rescan commands to force it to refresh.

There are 16.5M Bitcoins in circulation out of a total of 21M to ever be, and the remaining 4.5M would get generated over decades. If everyone mining stopped selling the coins, that means the supply just got reduced by 25%. Not much of an effect on the price, and now miners have nothing to pay their bills with.

Ultimately, the key is just a random number and the address is just a mathematical function over that number. You can do it on paper by hand is the need is great. 
However, the odds of making a mistake that way is quite likely much higher than a chance that a random computer in qualified hands is infected by some sneaky malware capable of parsing custom scripts for Bitcoin keys, so you're better off letting just a computer do all the math for you.

If that were to become true, then Bitcoin would be dead.
A distributed set of nodes, or more precisely an ability for anyone with ambiently available hardware to verify the blockchain for themselves, is what makes Bitcoin a thing.
Mass adoption is not some deadline set by a higher being, but rather a response to technological capabilities of a system. It would, by definition, come when the system is ready for it.
Thus delaying a few years in order to find a scaling solution that does not kill the core feature of Bitcoin is a pretty darn good idea. If it fails then increasing the block size is still an option, or more likely BCH would simply be king by then.


So we have two possible bets - to bet on BCH, a known to work scaling solution with uncertain long term perspectives and an ability to deliver, at best, a curious new form of regular digital money, or to bet on BTC, a not quite certain to work scaling solution with clearly defined long term perspectives and an ability to deliver a world-changing new form of money.
I prefer to take the latter bet.

No such things on Bitcoin. Miners produce blocks and submit it to the network of thousands of nodes (anyone can run a node), each of which verify them, and if correct propagate them to their peers. Same about transactions.
If miners were to make an invalid block, it won't propagate. Thus they have no verification power.
Every node verifies everything, so there are no special validating nodes.
The whole idea is that there is no trusted 3rd parties.

It's a good guess. Three options, really:
A. Satoshi is dead, keys are lost or hidden well enough to be so. (Hal Finney is the most likely candidate to being SN, and he is dead).
B. Satoshi is alive, but lost the keys. Not likely, but in light of C is not too relevant.
C. Satoshi is alive and got the keys. In that case trying to spend or move them would instantly identify and trace him, since you can bet your bottom dollar every agency worth it's salt set up every possible tracking measure to detect and trace an origin of such a transaction. So odds of him touching these coins are rather low.
Basically only option A has a chance of the coins not being lost, if they are hidden and would be found at some latter date.

If the hash rates drop, the mining would become profitable again for the remaining miners, since they would be earning more coins now. It's a self-regulating system.

Plenty of people forgot their passwords or didn't do backups right.

Setting aside trolls and scammers, the basic argument is that everything in tech scales exponentially and so should the capacity of the blockchain.
Increasing the block size sounds like this easy and consequence-free solution to increase transaction capacity, since storage is cheap and bandwidth is cheap. To see the problems with it requires doing a bunch of research and thinking, and many people tend not to, or simply trust the people who claimed to have done so and concluded that it's not a problem.
In a sense, it's a hardware people's approach to scaling - in hardware design, specifically things like IC architecture, you can't easily change the basic structure or process, so short term improvements are typically done by increasing the numbers, like clock rate of chips, higher voltage, more cooling, better production yields, etc.

Kinda. Wallets have patterns of use, so if you withdrawn money from an exchange (KYC AML link to you) to a fresh wallet, then many of your spendings and incomes would be easily traced to you. Reusing addresses would just make the job easier.
If you are getting paid in BTC, however, things are getting a bit harder - once out of a predictable wallet the tracing meets a combinatorial explosion. You'd still be able to track back by linking your purchases back to you, but it's harder to figure out how much total money you have.

Batching isn't going to have much of an effect at scale. None of the base layer solution would, actually - a blockchain is only as strong as it's weakest node, and no reasonable public-grade computer can process a worldwide amount of transactions. Many vendors saw that, and quietly or openly dropped support. A lot of adoption have shrunk due to that scaling uncertainty.
To really scale we need something else, something that scales more like e-mail where doubling the node count doubles the capacity. LN is one such solution, and it's still at the early stages. If it or some other scaling solution succeeds, then we will quite likely see the adoption go up again.
Then, looking back at the graph years later we will see an average of 2x the adoption per year, give or take a few dips.
That's the sum total of my argument. I'm not trying to deny the existence of current down trends or spread hope.

It's worth exploring. Near-instant transactions at no cost from a wallet app on your phone that you can use to buy a variety of stuff online (from cellphone refills to Steam games and Amazon gift cards). To me it feels like Bitcoin of the old days, quick and free and easy.
Do note that it's still kinda raw in the user experience, however. Setting it up tend to be fiddly, and the current protocol does not support one-transaction mixing of onchain and LN payments.
Long term value? Currently the onchain fees are near zero, so you can experiment and set things up at nearly no cost. So if you set things up now, then once the fees start to go up again as the hype builds up you would already have access to cheap transactions instead of having to experiment and set up at cost during the hype.

When demand is higher than the supply the price goes up until it reaches tghe point where enough demand drops to match the available supply.

Read the article i posted then. It's non-technical and explains these things really well, on real examples of several blockchains.


That's a whole lot of contradictions of basic definitions. What do you mean by "sidechains"? There are none so far or in near-term planning.
If you mean Lightning Network, then it's a second layer solution, essentially routing and aggregation layer for Bitcoin transactions. It's live now, and fees are paid to people running it's nodes, roughly on a 0.001 sat per sat sent scale.


Sure, but most of them require cooperation of bitter enemies on a global scale, rather than one company or government trying things.


You seem to be under impression that developers have any sort of power over where the development is going, and under impression that these developers are few in number and uniform in their ideas.
Also, what conflict of interest do you see there? Both are working on making Bitcoin better and more usable.


No. It's a case of one part's success making the other part's success bigger, for both parts.
In other words, there are no scenarios where success of LN would hurt Bitcoin or success of Bitcoin would hurt LN.

And verify, most importantly, so a CPU resource is needed too.
The problem is that Bitcoin does not scale the same way e-mail does. 
In e-mail doubling the computers on the network doubles the capacity. A million times the computers in the world, a million times more e-mail can be handled.
In Bitcoin, doubling the amount of computers on the network does not change the capacity. Add a million nodes, and the capacity stays the same.
In order to double the capacity on chain you need to double the system requirements of *every* node. This is a qualitatively different kind of scaling.
So, if we were targetting large scale adoption in 2 years with only on chain scaling, the capacity would have to be increased by a factor of 20, that is the system requirements of every node in the network is now 20x as high. But computers would only get about 2x better. So 90% of the nodes fall off the network.
In 2 more years the adoption goes even higher, and the capacity would have to be increased 10x more. Now only large datacenters can handle the load of running a node.
2 more years pass, and the adoption tries to increase even further, but it can not - the system requirements would have hit the limit of moore's law and can now scale no faster than 2x every two years. So the fees would explode and/or the whole thing would just stop working from overload.
Unconstrained requirements increase won't politely keep it's distance from the hardware power's growth curve, but rather it would race towards it until they slam into each other.
TL;DR: E-mail is as strong as the sum of all nodes that do run it, Bitcoin is as strong as the weakest node that can run it.

And yet, in the first world countries people are used to things like tapping a plastic card to a PoS terminal to pay, taking a total of 3 seconds before they move on with their day. Or to send money between each other by sending an SMS to a bank processing number, taking a total of 20 seconds.
Compared to THAT, Bitcoin is rather lousy. Only LN is even close to that kind of ease of use.

Bitcoin appears to grow along an exponential regression curve, and we just emerged from a popped bubble along it. So the price is likely to drift down a bit more, then start drifting back up again. I'd expect another bubble/bull run Q1 2019 at the earliest.
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:44:00


Thing is, if the resource usage is not artificially constrained it won't just politely keep it's distance from the curve of Moore's law. Rather it would go up until they slams into each other, excluding most people on the way.
In other words, it is true that today's smartphone can run what were the supercomputer's tasks 20 years ago, but the problem is that it can't run the supercomputer grade tasks of today. These scaled at the same pace as the hardware.


That i can agree with.


I was referring to the base layer's future being clearly defined, thus allowing one to use it as a reliable foundation to build layers on top of.
Lightning itself looks promising and well engineered, but is yet to survive the test of time and real world. If it's future was certain, then there would have been no bets to make.

If you hodl the abyss, the abyss also hodls you.
In other words, if you will be hurt enough to be scared should your investment sink beneath the waves never to recover, then you have invested more than you can afford to lose.
Don't be scared, however. Bear markets are these magical times when people can work on building things without getting constantly distracted by all the noise of a bull in the ATH shop.
Things are being made, progress is happening, Bitcoin is getting better and is set to reclaim it's lost ground in the near future.

Should be linear, i think. However, it is unlikely to be the real bottleneck - at 10Gb blocks your UTXO set would be proportionally enormous, so the verification times would be dominated by IO latencies of database access.

Not much sense, but i'll try to fill in the blanks and guess.
So, let's say you have a (testnet) transaction that takes a UTXO number 0 of TXID 3957b153eb3513b96c533a04ea29569415f13e7af742e9fad2895fc1b299da69 (worth 527961 sats), and gives 1300000 to 2NBMQpiPKh1pvPgBMbAq1RceV6wVhQGoj2f, change (100000) to moKcUjY7qEEbRXRhvH3GyfAgMs6vx6chr3, and a 100 sat fee. Here it is, broken down:
    ----Header, new format----
    02000000 00 01
    
    ----Inputs----

    ----Witness data----
    02  &lt;-- Not a count, but a type of data
     473044  &lt;-- signature header (DER)
      0220 78f961b4f9c1232b44a298311aa5dc43c0fc567a3f2187d1c95cbe9e2e0aab19  &lt;-- R

    ----Rest of TX----
    00000000  &lt;-- locktime
This will have:
txid:  18ba1080bd8905a56cb8eb352b28cbc91946f691df888dbc053e38e67a04d0a5
wtxid: 4b48c93d591db06f3a9b22b31b37bc96ec7d776ef64283f21c0d284fdd0e13f5
How do we calculate these? The WTXID is the equivalent of doing the old TXID, and is produced by hashing the whole transaction.
TXID is the legacy-style id, and is obtained by hashing only 01000000 (old header), inputs, outputs and locktime, essentially constructing an old-style transaction.
So, replace header and skip witness data.
Does that make sense to you, and is that what you was asking for?

About one to ten millisatoshi per satoshi sent, for small amounts. The largest i sent was about 0.004 BTC, and the fee was 588 sat. On the other side, a 6900 sat sent paid 7 sat fee.

It's not that simple. Scaling only by block size increase is a death spiral in the long term, so the less it is done the better.
Here is some detailed writeup on the matter, with Ethereum as an example (they currently are on the way of doom due to unconstrainde block size scaling): 
Working on the second layer is happening regardless, btw. It's simply progress.


What sort of threats? Bitcoin is not something that can be threatened by a company, or even by major governments. It's open source software and everyone have a clear choice of what changes to accept and not, so anything malevolent would simply not propagate.

Bitconnect is worth $0.4 now, which can be rounded down to zero considering it was worth $400 before the scam ended. If you were to think of crypto as a scam and a pyramid scheme, then you'd naturally expect it to pop and drop to near-zero.

Not the best graph, since it starts a year ago, at the peak of the ICO boom, and ends today in the middle of a bear market. You need to zoom way out to see the effects i'm talking about.
I do agree that what i'm talking about is strictly historical data and does not necessarily predict the future. I.e. if LN fails for some reason and nothing else comes up, we might very well be seeing the end days of Bitcoin.

Multiplying amount by price (aka market cap) is a rather lousy metric - if you try to buy a lot, the price will go up, if you try to sell a lot the price will go down.
That is, if you bought a billion $ worth of Bitcoin, the market cap would grow by more than $1bn.
Even if you take it at face value, $100bn is tiny even for a local currency. And Bitcoin is a global asset class.
So, i'd say the sky is the limit as far as price is concerned.

That's an odd perspective. Do you expect the people that foresaw the limits of the design of trains to wait until the trainwrecks start happening en masse before fixing the problem, or to work on the solution to be able to fix the trains before the wrecks happen even at the inconvenience of current operations?
Because Bitcoin is a long term thing. Very long term. Quick fixes and immediate-benefit-at-catastrophic-latter-costs types of solutions are not for this space. You have to plan ten moves in advance, lay down groundwork and roll out important updates that enable latter things way before the problems are supposed to appear or these latter things are finished.

I don't think $3k is enough. It would make a lot of individual miners quit, but the supermajority of the hashpower is at big industrial locations, which have way cheaper power prices. And it's not a threshold or a linear process - the lower it goes, the cheaper it is per BTC to mine, so it would have to keep dropping.
The danger is that if enough miners drop off, the hashrate would drop low enough that single entities would have access to enough equipment to pull off 51% attacks - the hardware is not going to vanish, it is just switched off.
See Bcash, for example - they use the same equipment as Bitcoin and got 10% of it's hashrate, so any of our miners can switch over for a moment, pull off a 51% attack and go back. It would be the same here, only with "switch on, switch off".

The two are not mutually exclusive. The price volatility would go down as market cap goes up, so a few decades from now it would be about as steady as gold.
Coinbase like companies are exchanges and custodians, they aren't going anywhere any time soon. As long as there is a need to exchange between fiat and Bitcoin there would be exchanges, and centralised ones are more efficient in a quiet economy. As long as the generations of today live there would be custodians, banks, managing their coins since that is easy and familiar.

Sigh. Try to actually use Lightning before claiming such ideal case figures.
In practice it tends to take several seconds to send a lightning transaction these days, since a lot of routing info constantly gets stale. The only way to tell a stale channel from a live one is to try routing through it and get an error back, so it takes many attempts to find a live route.
I'd say we are in the high dozens to low hundreds of tx/sec now on LN, with a capacity to do 10x to 100x that, which is nowhere near the millions you claim.

If the coins are sent, then your wallet would show an incoming unconfirmed transaction at once. Or you could type your address you gave them into a block explorer and see the transaction there.

It's kind of a valid question, despite being asked by a scammer.
Would LN be able to absorb enough of the hype to let the fees stay sane? What sort of new failure modes would we see under high fee conditions? Eventually, what would we do when the price goes high enough to make even the minimum fee (286 sat?) too expensive?

Problem is, BTCPay is great to receive Bitcoin, and that's it. A merchant is then left with a bunch of what they see as useless weird internet money, and they have bills to pay.

Kinda yes, but that's not an easy attack. The way the network works now, first one to transmit gets to make the transaction, and the latter ones would be rejected, so they will have to have both a quantum computer and a large part of hashpower to override this weak consensus.

I'm in Russia proper.
Yes, housing used to be assigned to you, and private ownership was only legalized in late 80s. But the real fun started in early 90s where they made it so anyone can privatize a place they live in, for free but within some limits, and all the communal property started flowing into people's hands. It wasn't that fast - i think i read something like 50% of it got privatized by 2000, but the program kept being extended and is still ongoing. Everyone was (and still is) registered to a specific place by a central database, so proof and documentation wasn't a problem.
Interesting enough, around 2000 is also when mortgages became legal, and a few years later the property prices started to climb really fast - $2k for a 3 room apartment in late 90s, $15k for a one room apartment in 2001-ish, $100k for a 3 room apartment in 2005. I suspect it got more to do with lack of supply as the new generation grew up and started trying to move out, however. Loans still weren't a big thing by the time 2008 happened, so it wasn't that much of an event here and acted more as vaccination against mortgages - stories of people getting burned are still circulating as warnings that you shouldn't take one, and property prices had been slowly going down ever since.
TL;DR: Look up privatization.


Hm, i would have expected them to have a similar state registration database. If that got lost, then there is little one can do to prove anything, and blockchains are not going to help in any way there.

Oh, certainly. I don't see it crossing such a psychological barrier quietly - the first time it reaches $1M would likely be the peak of a bubble. People would be buying like mad, in full FOMO mode, completely oblivious to history and common sense.

I'm still confused why Uber is a thing. I do, however, come from a place with well-developed public transit, and a taxi for me is some luxury/emergency service.
It might have displaced taxis in places where taxis are important, but Uber's prices are still an order of magnitude higher than a bus or a subway. So, to really make a difference it would have to compete with that, rather than with taxis.
Similar thing with Bitcoin - it might be able to compete with online payments and displace them, but there are still orders of magnitude to go before it can come even close to competing with cash.

The blockchain itself is the only real source there. Google "blockchain parsing tools" for making it easy.
Be aware that there is no such concept as a "wallet" in Bitcoin, what users have are key rings made out of unrelated keys. There are heuristics to determine which keys belong to the same entity, but they are not too precise and modern software tend to actively obfuscate these links.
However, as a first order approximation you can build your graph to represent individual address balances, and it should be both easy and somewhat meaningful.

It sounds like you are missing a few concepts.
Bitcoin is not a company and not a balance. It does not have stocks.
Bitcoin is a currency, best described as a digital version of gold - fixed supply, personal ownership, no third parties.
So, buying it would be like buying USD, for example - you got $1000 for 1290 CAD today, and 3 months down the line you still have $1000, but it's now worth, say, 1200 CAD.
Same with Bitcoin - you get 0.1 BTC for 516 CAD today, and 3 months later you'd still own 0.1 BTC, but it would cost, say, 600 CAD. Or it could cost 400 CAD, since it's an open market and no one can guarantee you a growth and profit.

Historically, alts lagged behind BTC's bull market - once the rally stops people would try to "diversify", taking the prices up.
Might not happen this time, however - i.e. last time avos was strong with ETH and it looked promising, nowadays it's highly uncertain. LTC is basically a second-tier testnet for BTC, they are extremely similar in code. It tends to stay around the same price in BTC terms, so i'd expect it to track BTC with some lag.
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:24:01

Go to  , and look at the transaction density.

@_date: 2019-02-23 18:01:16
What do you mean by "account"? Is it something on a site somewhere? Is it something in software?
If you want to be done with Bitcoin, sold all of it and want to "close" it, then there is nothing there to close. Just forget it existed and move on, there won't be any things, entities or fees hanging behind.
If you want to erase your transaction history from past uses of Bitcoin, then that's literally impossible - it is stored on hundreds of thousands of computers across the world in the most immutable form possible, secured by 2% of the world's energy consumption.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:35:41
Well, how much do you need to sell to stay afloat (that is, with a roof over your head and all the necessities), per month, in percentage of your total stash?
If it's something around 1% a month, then just sell it - do the math, at 1% a month you'd be at 78% of your initial hoard in 2 years (an average plausible time before the ATH would be reached again).
At 0.5% monthly you'd be at 88%.
At 2% monthly you'd be at 61%.
At 3% monthly you'd be at 48%.
All of that beats being homeless, while not putting much of a dent into your long term state.
If it's more than a few percent a month, then you'd have to face some hard choices. Are you willing and able to be homeless and survive like that for years on hope of brighter future? Most people wont be able to, even if they think they are. You might not even be able to retain your keys in that situation, making the whole exercise pointless.
I got friends who were burned by the dot com bubble, it took them 15 years to get back on their feet after the companies went below the waves never to recover. It might be a good idea to own your earlier decision, start over and concentrate on staying afloat.
Yes, you will have regrets either way - i sold at $50, only to get a much better job a month later and see the price go to $1000 6 month later.

@_date: 2017-11-27 01:30:07
Hm? I don't think that's the most likely scenario - by now no one is taking the forks seriously.
What can be a threat is that Bitcoin is a big juicy target, and there are many attacks that can delay it's development, while other cryptos often maintain a low profile.
Imagine that the UASF failed, the agreement on the BIP91 never got reached or in some other way the SegWit debate was still ongoing and continued on and on. It's quite conceivable that some other crypto would have taken the niche by the end of next year, purely on technological superiority and well-timed PR. Ethereum could have done it, if it wasn't so shoddily built. IOTA might have been it as well, if it's designer didn't have a boner for Soviet computers.
It's not completely inconceivable that something like that would repeat, given a perfect storm.

It wasn't that apparent back then. Take satellite phones, for example. When Iridium was planned, it sounded ridiculous to plant a cell tower every few miles all over the surface of the planet, so the future was obviously in satellite phones available anywhere in the world.
By the time it launched, however, the tower planting was in full swing, and the coverage on cell phones was already nowhere nearly as bad as it used to be, and they didn't require you to have a clear view of the sky as a sat phone would.
A bit too slow and a bit too late, and the market was gone.

A. Partial use - ZCash allows unhidden transactions as well, which make hidden ones stand out. Moenro hides them ll, so you can't tell if someone has something to hide or not merely by the fact they used a hidden tx.
B. Trusted setup. It's impossible to prove if it was actually secured or not, and there appear to be theoretically possible attack vectors emerging these days. Monero, while not perfectly untraceable, does not require trust.

1 or 3, since 2 is a common scam.
3 is simple and straightforward, zero maintenance, accounting or running costs.
1 is essentially continuously buying Bitcoin given an initial investment and running costs. At $100k scale there most likely would also be rent and commercial power connection involved. Over a long period of time this could produce more coins than if you just bought them, but there are also continuous running costs and maintenance. 
Thing to note is that mining revenue is going to drop off over time - look up the difficulty over the last years, so if your brand new miners are making X coins today, then might very well be making X/3 coins in a year. Fortunately, the ASICs are already banging against the technology limits, so massive jumps in difficulty are no longer likely, but the steady growth is not going anywhere.
Another thing to research is taxes - if you would be selling the produce of your mining to cover the costs, then taxes would apply, probably at higher rates than long term capital gains of simply buying coins.
With all that in mind, do the math and consider your ability and willingness to see it through over the years.

Think about all the kinds of passwords and password systems you ever used, write them all down, look for patterns in them.
Then, write a script that would brute-force all the permutations.
I.e. if you tend to use a password made out of a date, a word and a symbol, make a script that goes through your favorite dates, a dictionary and a list of symbols mixed up in various order - that would take much less time than full brute-force.
I have successfully recovered my password for a 100 LTC wallet that way, despite only being able to remember thinking "here is a cool way of making good passwords!" as i made that wallet.

Fun fact, back when Russia went from 2G directly to 4G in 2008 or so i was really looking forward to having a portable TV in the shape of a smartphone. Finally bought one. Fast internet on a phone was rather amazing, and an ability to watch literal TV on the train was too... 
For about a day. It got old really fast, and it was a better part of a decade before i noticed streaming services again and figured out the idea was a bit before it's time back then. In retrospect, the connection was still rather flakey, the video compression was rather bad and it was literally TV where you had no choice what to watch.
The tech improved over the years, and something that used to be a borderline stupid idea mutated into something that is widely normal.
Can't help but notice a few parallels with Bitcoin here.

Mining is equivalent to buying an X amount of BTC for price Y, with it being paid out to you over time Z.
Y is the price of equipment plus running expenses. Z is the time the equipment produce more than it costs to run as the difficulty grows, typically on the order of a year, X is the BTC output over that time.
Comparing to buying Bitcoin (or buying equipment with Bitcoin, which is equivalent), the payoff would typically happen after 1 or 2 years, depending on your electricity costs.
Certainly, in fiat terms you would return your investment in a month or two during bull market, or in a year during bear market, but to get return in BTC itself you would have to wait much longer, and you have to be in the upper 50% by energy efficiency.
This relation does not depend on price of Bitcoin, speed of price increase/decrease and so on - so far as coin's difficulty is correlated with it's price (true for any mature coin), this will hold true.

2010 Came across an article called "Bitcoin: Nerd toys or galactic credits?"
Looked it up, downloaded, mined a few hundred (on a CPU, with a "generate" button in the wallet), forgot about it.
2011 Noticed Bitcoin hit $1. Paid a dozen BTC to refill a phone. "This is so cool!". Forgot about it.
Mid-2013 Noticed Bitcoin approaches $200. Figured out exchanges, sent coins to MtGox, tried to sell, price tumbled down, order never went through. Calmed down for a few days, price stabilized around $50. Fuck it. Sold. Spent a few months trying to get the money out, they eventually asked for 5% fee to transfer. Agreed, got the money, was happy.
Late 2013 Watch Bitcoin climb to $1000. Regret. All the regret. Eventually forgot about it.
Mid-2017 Finally read the whitepaper and done some research on just WHAT Bitcoin is. Regret x 100.

It was more of an analogy than an actual description, but here in Russia the government is quite literally planning to have a kill switch for the external internet connections. As a side effect it would disconnect the whole region from Bitcoin and might even cause various disruptions outside. At such level it would indeed be a losing battle.
However, consider what would happen if the example were to get contagious. Countries or blocks of them build disconnects, ways to isolate their internal networks from the rest of it. Russia because of the "we are a nation under siege" politics, USA because "Build a Digital Wall against Russian hackers!", European Union because USA did so, China because China, etc.
Then things happen, the connections are cut, and suddenly the internet is fragmented into several blocks. Suddenly there is no longer a single network and single consensus. If the connections were to reappear a few days later, most of the world's transactions would be wiped out in a mother of all reorgs by whichever  isolated chain happens to be the longest.
A global internet fragmentation event is not too hard to imagine, and it would devastate Bitcoin really quickly whether it's the intended goal or a side effect.

One confirmation tends to be enough for everyday use. It means that the transaction is in a block, and lacking hardcore ongoing shenanigans, direct attack against you by miners or 1-in-50000 chance of natural reorg at just the right fee threshold, the transaction is already final.
Basically, each additional confirmation increases the odds of finality (and cost of attack), with the recommended 6 being equivalent to odds low enough you can bet millions of dollars without worry on them.
And yes, BitPay is a terrible choice.

@_date: 2019-12-01 10:38:24
Ok, looked around and done some math. TL;DR: Odds are bad.
On a single 6-GPU mining rig you can crack a 6 symbol password of given description in about 4 days. 7 symbols in about a year, 8 symbols in a 100 years.
One such rig costs about $500 in power to run for a year. So, to be done in a year with 7 symbols you'd have to invest $500 runtime cost, with 8 symbols - $50k, with 9 symbols - $5 million.
Most password generators don't even have an option for a password shorter than 8 symbols, so $50k is about the lower margin of how much this would cost in just electricity.
At 0.9375 BTC per password, you aren't likely to break even on the deal unless you already have a 600 GPU mining farm and Bitcoin goes parabolic in the near future. Otherwise, you'd make more money just mining.

Check the mempool stats here, especially the lower graph: 
That's how many transactions are pending right now, and their fee levels.
If the graph is flapping around in the breeze somewhere near zero, then any fee would get you in the nearest block.
If you see congestion, zoom out a bit - if it's been there for a while, odds are low fees are going to take a while and you should pick something near the current 1 Mb fee level. If not, it should take a few hours at any fee. 
Zoom out to about 2 years ago to see what the worst that could happen looks like. If it looks like this again, expect month of wait time at lowest fees.

What wallets/nodes and use cases?
I've been using Eclair for about a year, every now and then a payment would fail several times in a row. Even rarer, it would get stuck indefinitely (in the old days that needed channel close/open to recover from, these days it typically expires in an hour). At least once i had a channel that would suck routing in like a black hole and always fail. It all adds up to anxious sense of wonder what would break next, which used to be compounded by not knowing what the wallet was doing back before they added status reports a month ago.
On the node side of things, c-lightning had been fairly stable and reliable, and is typically my backup payment route. But "SSH into a server from a phone" is not a very fast backup plan, so i still don't like the idea of having to pay via LN in time critical places.
@_date: 2019-04-07 00:02:28
The problem is not how well it works, the problem is what happens when it does not. I find it to be quite an anxiety fest because there are 3 options:
1. It works nice and often quick.
2. It takes ~30 sec and fails to find a live route.
3. Repeat 2 a few times, and a payment might gets stuck indefinitely.
Now, 3 happens rarely and most of the hard cases happened in the early days, but it still does happen. When it happens, you are basically locked out of your funds for either minutes or days. The result is that every time i need to make a timely LN transaction it's an anxiety spike.

$50 levels are more of a propaganda factoid than any real fees, what was common is fees in the $1-$10 range at the peak of the winter hype.
But in any case, fixed block limit at the current level is not optional - the primary feature of Bitcoin is it's censorship resistance and trustlessness. Even now with about 2 Mb block size limit the bandwidth requirements are quite oppressive, limiting nodes to first world countries and/or financially well off people. Raising it further would quickly price most people out of being able to run their own node and verify their own money, thus making Bitcoin literally meaningless.
That's why it's a hard problem - a scaling solution must be found within the constraints on node system requirements that enables use of ambiently available hardware and connections.

@_date: 2019-04-07 02:01:08


AFAIK that's not how it works. LN security model requires an ability to settle a channel in the court of the blockchain, so if fees are higher than the channel size the settlement won't be possible. This would open it up to various forms of abuse and lock-ins and would require people to trust their peers, which is far from ideal.
However, none of these exploits i can think of are profitable and things would remain functional, so it's not impossible that it would find a way.

Might not be enough - they came together and banned drugs, at little to no positive effect.
@_date: 2019-04-07 01:53:55
Perhaps. I don't remember having to pay double-digit fees, but then again i could afford to time things out and optimize. One thing is certain - the fees went off the charts, and Bitcoin was close to unusable.
Thing is, that's not what i argue with. High and/or unpredictable fees would certainly harm Bitcoin. What i argue is that raising the system requirements would be worse while not really solving anything permanently. A blockchain is a broadcast network, it is as strong as the weakest allowable node. Double the requirements, double the capacity. Ten times the use, ten times the bandwidth. Look at Ethereum to see where that road would lead - it's pretty much impossible to verify their whole blockchain on any hardware now, and while they argue it's ok for them because for them only the current state matters, in Bitcoin that is not so.
Simply speaking, that way lays certain doom. On the other hand, with fixed system requirements the base layer remains secure and verifiable, even if it would be unusable every other year. From this starting point there are options. None of them are certain to succeed, but that is still better than options that are certain-to-fail.

In a miner chip you don't need that level of perfection. A fault most often means that a few of the  hashing units won't work, reducing the total hashrate slightly. It's made out of redundancy.
So they don't need anywhere near as perfected a 7nm process as Intel would need.

Read up on public key cryptography and digital signatures, specifically ECDSA.
In short, a public key is mathematically derived from the private key, and a private key can be used to sign a message. "Sign" means generate a mathematical proof that a certain message have been produced by the owner of the private key of a certain public key. This is secure because of the underlying mathematics being irreversible, i.e. multiplying to large integer numbers is trivial, but finding which two integers were multiplied to get a particular product is absurdly difficult.

Difficulty keeps going up, so the same equipment produces less coin for the same expense.
Same can work in reverse - if the price drops low enough, the least profitable miners would start to fall off the grid, the difficulty drops and the cost of mining drops with it.
So there is no long term floor to Bitcoin price.

Blocks are made based on rules that all nodes agree upon. One of these rules is that the block reward - new coins created - is halved every 210000 blocks, or about 4 years. It started at 50 BTC per block, currently it's 12.5 BTC, by about 2140 it would be exactly 0. This is known as an asymptotic function, and the number it approaches is just under 21 million.
Lost coins have no bearing on this process, so effectively there would be quite a bit less than 21M BTC available in the long run.

Sure, but we already had an increase 2 years ago and are quite a bit ahead of the tech growth curve. I don't see another increase being beneficial this decade, and likely for a big part of the next one.


The minority in question tend to be the very people for whom Bitcoin can have the most impact, however. Increasing system requirements at anything close to the global rate of growth would only work to ensure they stay permanently priced out.

To be honest, the kind of advertisements don't actually matter. I appreciate your effort and understand that you want to get paid one way or another, but advertisement is, without going too deep into a discussion, a form of evil. The sooner it disappear as a concept, the better.
Interestingly enough, this is a problem Bitcoin could solve. Look at yalls.org - it's a demo site where reading anything requires you to pay some testnet coin via lightning. Direct micropayment from the consumer to the creator. It's rather clunky right now, but once that part is solved it can be a practical morally sound alternative to advertisement revenue.
If you are feeling adventurous you can even try to implement a similar system as an alternative to whitelisting - lightning is starting to grow fast on the mainnet already.

Depends wildly on your cost of living. Here in Russia the average income is $3k per year, and you can survive for a third of that. So set a target of $10k per year for a luxurious life, and you would need about $1M to cover an extended lifespan and a few emergencies.
That's about 100 BTC at current prices, about 10 BTC at pessimitic expectations and under 1 BTC at optinmistic expectations.
Now move to California, USA. So far as i heard, if you make $100k a year you are barely above the powerty line. So, set a target of $1M per year for a luxurious life, and the same numbers become 10k BTC, 1k BTC at 100 BTC.
As i said, it's very relative.

Two facets to this.
USA is about to wake up in a few hours. Imagine that the markets are taking a plunge starting from the morning. It's on the news. Imagine being someone who bought Bitcoin some time back, but have no stocks. Either you'd go and sell "while it's still valuable" since you have no idea it's something else, or you would hope it to be a safe haven, look at it, see it falling, and then sell a bit later, seeing your expectations fail. You would be thinking about paying the bills, changes to the debt, future retirement vanishing and so on, not about this vague internet money thingy. If you have stocks or a trader, what would you sell first - well known stocks that would surely bouce back, or that speculative, weird new Bitcoin thing that have been going down for months now?
The second facet is, it's insanely easier to sell than to buy. It takes weeks or months to buy if you never done this before, but selling takes 10 minutes, give or take bank wire speed (which is not really relevant in case of a crash, the exchange rate would tank regardless). By the time people who wanted to flee the crash into Bitcoin can reach it, everything would already be done and dusted.
So i expect Bitcoin to crash hard if there is any large stock market crash, and as a result it would get a lot of negative press "dispelling the illusion of safe haven" which would break things even more.
Very few people comprehend what decentralised currency means and what makes it valuable, the rest would treat it as yet another asset and yet another industry, and so it would behave like one.
At best it would take a generation and some heavy crashes for it to be understood, at worst it would go the route of the internet, becoming pseudo-decentralized thingy or an oddity like Tor that is used by a minority everyone is suspicious of.

It took Facebook how long to get that many users? A decade plus? I doubt Bitcoin is going to grow much faster than that.
Bitcoin is like the internet - it always fails to scale in the moment, and as long as it continues failing to scale again and again and again over the decades, we are good.
More precisely, problems are getting solved as they come. Block size increase is a nuclear option level solution, since it greatly impacts the network security. So far it was only been done once, and i don't expect another one until all the other options (signature aggregations, lightning network itself, channel batching, etc) are exhausted and there is no way forward without it.

It's the same as getting burned in a pyramid scheme back in school, the lesson sticks well if you take care to think it through and assign the blame to the only part that you have an ability to change - yourself.

At a minimum, basic cryptography should be taught in schools, smartphones or similar devices should become either paper-and-pen common or be issued to everyone, and a generation or two should die out for the novelty resistance to be dissipated.
Seeing that it took about 20 years from public proliferation of the internet to the point where you can do basic state operations online and Bitcoin is about 5 years in the public, i'd say it would take 10-15 years.

Bots work on short-term patterns (seconds to hours), which are quite predictable.
Long term patterns are not.
It's like the weather - you can predict with great accuracy that it would rain tonight, with some accuracy that there might be a storm tomorrow, and with only historical expectations that there will be no snow next summer. Sure, global warming is still there and it would get warmer and warmer, but this does not necessarily prevent a sudden summer snowstorm.

Cashed out most of it not long before MtGox crashed. They weren't processing withdrawals already, but for a "small fee" of 5% they sent mine through. ~30 BTC sold for $3000 or so total. That felt like a lot of money, considering that i got the BTC for nothing in 2010, and was a final push for me to quit the job i had at the time, moving on to a much better one.
Sadly, a few months later i was staring at a graph reaching towards $1000/BTC while sitting at a job that pays over $3000 *per month*, and contemplating that life-changing decision i made a few months earlier.

What sort of thing can allow people to "compete fairly in the ASIC area"?
The nature of micromanufacturing is such that the cutting edge does not scale down in price, so even if someone was to make a "chip printer" for hobby-level ICs it would still stay orders of magnitude behind the industrial processes. I can't imagine anything that would allow small players to enter the ASIC business on a competitive level.

The price of mining one bitcoin is estimated to be in range of $3k-$4k, that's the closest thing to a practical bottom we have. Even if we go below that, futures markets will let miners to sustain operation for some time.

1 is the old name for nuclear reactors. Early on it was promised that there will be a reactor in every home, give or take a car. 6 was a cornerstone promise back in USSR.
The point isn's so much to list only things that never happened or are impossible, but to list the promises that didn't pan out. 
Sure fusion is possible, but it was just around the corner for decades and still is. Sure videochatting is a thing, but not at the scale it was imagined in the 90s - people got into texting instead. Sure we had supersonic passenger jets, but they turned out to be uneconomic.

Trading (that is, buy and hold) tends to be more profitable than mining, especially for people who aren't technical.
However, if you already got the hardware, then your ROI time is around zero and mining would quickly be profitable too (and a good excuse to learn things).

Conceptually that's what you need to do, but if there are auto-replay nodes (which happened in ETH/ETC fork), then it's not very reliable and bound to timing (That is, first tx you send would propagate to both networks before you could send the other one, so while you won't be hurt you would still fail to succeed). You need to enforce a difference between the two.

It's kinda like weather forecasts. The short-term (seconds-minutes-maybe hours) market movements have distinct patterns to them and are predictable enough that high-speed trading bots are a huge business.
Medium term is kinda vague, there are still patterns, but it's more of a gamble. You have to account for many external factors like tone of the news, you have to deal with recursive feedback and so on. And it would still only take some billionaire yapping on the news to throw all your predictions out of the window.
Long term is pure guesswork, that essentially boils down to a binary choice of "moon vs zero".

Currently it takes 1.5 minutes to download the full gossip data set, and that would scale more or less linearly with channel count. This could be problematic for mobile wallets, which typically don't stay online all the time and so need to re-sync periodically or suffer ever-increasing routing failure rates.
In regular full-time online operation that's not a problem, since the amount of actual updates is tiny, and it would be orders of magnitude before that gets overwhelmed.
Source routing itself is much less of a problem than it is portrayed, but is unlikely to scale to millions of channels.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:31:19
"Might" is quite a bet with that much money. And even if you do, you still need to get home, find the backup, type it into some wallet, make a new wallet, move the funds. It would take some time, all of which would be available for the pickpocket to do their thing.

The problem with routing being aware of capacity is that the LN gossip protocol does not include the data. You need to get it from the blockchain.
As a matter of fact, it does not even include the full TXID of the funding transaction, but rather just a block_number:tx_number_in_it:output_number point, which makes it extra hard for light wallets like Eclair to determine the capacity - you can't just fetch a transaction over most common APIs using that info.
It's still rather rough around the edges, sadly.

The difficulty is too high to mine Bitcoin on a GPU. It was so since 2013, and by now you would be getting exactly nothing on a gaming rig. To mine Bitcoin you need ASICs, specialized processors that do the mining's task, and these are pricey and do nothing else.

Ah, that's a nice place to be at.
In case you forgot by now, for regular folks $250k is about as much money as one might hope to accumulate after a lifetime of working and no extra expenses. Managed languages and a few months of testing is nowhere nearly enough to to even consider trusting that kind of money to, much less on someone else's computer.
So if one did do that, it broadcasts a fairly distinct message - that you have so much money, most likely in the form of easy-to-steal crypto, that you won't be hurt or even seriously inconvenienced by losing $250k.
In other words, it marks them as a juicy target - it's not the safety of the node that is worth worrying about, but the safety of their own person.

Uh, no. There is no floating point in any Bitcoin calculations - it's all done with 64bit integers. Internally, it's all in satoshis.

Yes, now it is safe. The S2X is expected around Nov 18th, and you should take care closer to that time (days away) and after it.

Lightning. And no, it's not profitable - routing fees are aptly described as "unfairly cheap", so you'd earn a few cents equivalent per week or so.
More precisely, typical routing fees are on the order of 1 sat per 10k sats routed, so you'd need to route 0.01 BTC per every cent of earnings.

They certainly are there for good, at least until something way better comes along.

Yep, it can be converted to USD or whatever else. It's effectively a foreign currency that is foreign in every country.
In this context it would be best to replace "Bitcoin" with "Money" - "Someone who has a lot of money could invest theirs into a film". So the problem is not so much a technical one as it is a social one - finding the said someone willing to invest. Using Bitcoin can make it a bit more frictionless and allow you to reach out to people globally, but you still need to find said people.

If you don't plan on trading, then it would be safer to keep your own keys - Coinbase is rather questionable as far as the 2X fork goes, and you might end up on the wrong side of it.
Now, storing your own keys is kind of like having your own gold at home - it's your responsibility to keep them safe. If stored on a computer, be aware that Windows machines are permeable to all sorts of malware. 
If you don't have much BTC (in your terms), you can store it in a (secured and backed up) wallet on your computer. If you got a lot, get a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger Nano). 
If you are willing to get an understanding how Bitcoin works, then you would be able to safely handle a paper wallet, essentially the private keys printed as an encrypted QR code on a piece of paper. These are good for long-term storage, but are tricky to use.

In that case it would make all the sense in the world to start over with a brand new identity.
There is exactly nothing to be gained from trying to present as Satoshi again, if you are legit.

0-conf is possible. It's called Lightning Network, and it works by routed exchange of signed but not broadcast Bitcoin transactions. These need no confirmations, since they only get broadcast in case of a conflict or settlement, so the system is secure.
The "0-conf" of the sort found in plain Bitcoin and Bcash is not actually 0-conf transactions, they are *unconfirmed* transactions, and as such essentially not secure in any significant sense.

Sigh. Having "coins on LN" means having a UTXO on Bitcoin blockchain that you have keys for.
It's not some special token or IOU, it's literally real Bitcoins in a smart contract UTXO for which both parties have keys giving them access proportional to the channel's distribution.
Also, if fees get that high then Bitcoin would have failed long before then. Contrary to FUD, scaling on chain is mandatory for LN to work and is not getting omitted.

A fork is when one side enforces one set of rules starting from block X, and the other side enforces the other set of rules.
If it's unplanned, like Ethereum/ETC where transaction format was unchanged, then a transaction "in progress", that is in mempool, would likely occur on both of them.
If it's well planned, like Bitcoin/BCH where transaction format was changed by BCH side, then a transaction in progress would be invalid on the forked off side, so you don't have to worry about anything.
If a transaction is already confirmed by the time a fork occurs, then it would end up on both sides regardless of changes.

Right now every change is being broadcast across the network (Gossip protocol, BOLT 7), so nodes know where the tracks are at every moment. With that knowledge a route gets built and a train is fired, going one track segment at a time. If the tracks disappeared, the train would bounce back to origin and another route would be tried. There is no case where the train would vanish with the tracks - either the channel is closed after an HTLC passes it, or it would close before it reaches it and won't be attempted.
There are two problems with this.
One, a node have to be online all the time to monitor changes or have to spend a minute downloading the network state on each start. Plenty of channels sit there unchanged for a while, but over days enough changes would accumulate to make the stale network data almost useless.
The second problem is that current implementations don't handle nodes vanishing mid-flight all that well, the case where the station disappears while the train is at it, rather than just the tracks. In that case your money can get stuck for days in the time locks. It's quite rare, but still a problem to be solved.

In theory, you should have a good chance to recover a wallet - encryption is a recent thing (2012?), and many people didn't use it anyway since odds of forgetting the password used to be higher than odds of getting hacked.

ISPs blocking are not a thing for LN - network state is propagated within the network itself, similar to what Bitcoin does, so you don't need to connect to every node in order to know about them.
It look to me that they don't prune stale channels - ones that haven't been updated for longer than two weeks. That would be consistent with somewhat inflated stats. This does not necessarily make them wrong - stale channel pruning is a "MAY do" level policy.

To do a context-free coin split you would have to use nlocktime fields after the chains got a sufficiently large separation, and to broadcast transactions to different chains at once.

Mempool is a decentralised ephemeral construct, each node has it's own. All you need to scam with an unconfirmed transaction is to make sure the seller's node mempool sees the good transaction and some miner node's mempool sees the bad transaction.
Only when tx has been included in a block is it verified by all nodes and is actually secure.

Bitcoin is not some guaranteed-to-get-rich scheme, but rather a volatile new technology that still tends to grow. It might conceivably stay at the current order of magnitude of price for decades, or it could go up into millions of $ per coin in the coming year, there is no way to tell.

Well, Satoshi was shortsighted. He committed many failures to comprehend exponential scaling, typical of humans. Like he thought that mining won't exceed 4 Gh/s by much, or that 8 decimal points of scaling would be enough. So we are left with a task of building on top of that and trying to improve it.
There are options, however.
Second layer like LN can already process transactions in 1/1000th of sats. Fractional parts can't be practically settled on chain, but settlement is not supposed to happen often enough for this to be a total show stopper. 
On the base layer, we might have to do a hard fork eventually, so it stands to reason to enlarge the scale when it happens.
Without a hard fork, there might be some clever soft fork solution. I've heard of probabilistic settlements, for example.
TL;DR: USD/sat parity isn't going to happen for decades (that's $100M/BTC), and there are options being worked on that allow less-than-one-sat payments.

Consider e-mail. It is sent from sender to receiver across several relays. If you double the number of computers using it, the capacity doubles.
Consider Bitcoin. Everything is broadcast to and verified by every node. If you double the number of computers using it, the capacity stays the same.
For a blockchain's capacity to double you need to double the system requirements of a computer running it, rather than a number of computers. 
Simply speaking, a blockchain is as strong as it's weakest node.
This is a hard-limited scaling path, and long before hitting the absolute limits we would go out of reach of regular people - no reasonable computer can handle a world full of transactions, and without that decentralization would be essentially murdered.
Consider Lightning Network. In it payments are sent from sender to receiver across several relays. If you double the number of computers using it, the capacity doubles.
Quite obviously, the latter would be able to scale by a bucket of orders of magnitude more than a plain blockchain.
Most of the rest of things BCH supporters say are false or misleading - LN is as secure as Bitcoin, since it IS Bitcoin transactions. It would remain decentralized because in it centralization is incompatible with scaling. There are challenges to surmount, but they are on the engineering level, not on conceptual one.
Security risks of an LN node is broadly similar to the ones of a Bitcoin node, plus the extra toll of it being a hot wallet, minus the concerns of Bitcoin's unencrypted protocol.
A node should have at least two channels to benefit the network and have better privacy, but there is nothing terribly bad about having only one.
Routing is not part of the BOLT standard for the same reason it's not part of TCP/IP protocol - it's a separate problem on a separate level, and can be (and better be) solved in many ways.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:34:16
Not really.
On one hand, you run a hot wallet on an AWS instance of known type in a known region with a known IP, with enough money in it to be worth the time investment of trying to exploit a few known and/or unknown vulnerabilities, since it's likely feasible to get access to the same physical machine your VM is running on.
On the other hand, it's way way easier to get away with stealing crypto than with stealing physical things, and crooks are getting up to speed on that -  Since you casually risk that much money it would imply to them that you have way more, and they know your name and approximate location.
TL;DR: Please be careful.

Market cap does not mean that there is exactly that much money in there. It's just the total possible amount of Bitcoins multiplied by current price.
All it would take to get the price that high is if some billionaire decided to buy a few 100k of coins - all the coins for sale would get rapidly exhausted and the price will shot up unconstrained, and would likely linger there for a while, supported by the extreme FOMO that would follow.

"What is a Bitcoin full-node?", "-A wallet that stores the whole blockchain on the machine it is installed on"
That's not correct. The defining property of a full node is that it verifies everything and propagates valid transactions and blocks on the network. It might not even store the whole chain to do that (but need to process all of it initially).
On the contrary, a wallet coupled with a block explorer would store the whole chain, but won't be a full node since it does not verify and does not propagate.

Not exactly. If you have a change address that have less than ~0.00075 BTC (150 bytes*500 sat/byte), then that change is worthless.

Hm, AFAIK the wallet is compatible all the way back to 2012-ish and 0.7.0. If not, another option would be to install an older version and use it instead.
Not sure about ordering - each time there is a transaction, the change is sent to a new address. With regular use this could produce an impressive list of them. I don't think the API calls would show completely unused ones, so all there is should be all you had. I had at one point extracted a key from a moderately used wallet, and the list wasn't particularly long.

No, Segwit by itself is an unrelated protocol update that separates the signatures from the transactions in block storage, thus fixing transaction malleability problem (which prevents efficient implementation of many second level scaling solutions).
The way it is implemented to be backwards-compatible also causes an effective block size increase to about 1.8Mb, since the signatures would be stored in an area that is not counted towards the limit.
Block size increase is a completely separate thing, and the 2x proposal was supposed to increase it to 2Mb, giving us effectively 3.6Mb blocks, not 14.4Mb ones this code is trying to do.

If you sell, you are protected against a case of total Bitcoin failure. This is not very likely.
If you hold (hodl), then you are protected against the whole forkstorm, and would emerge with same or greater value on hands once it blows over. This option is good in case of Bitcoin staying valuable and/or growing. Which is likely, in one form or another.
You won't "double your money", since the sum of values of the forks would be equal or below the equivalent pre-fork value. In the long term, one would emerge victorious and the rest would be 10 to infinity times cheaper.

As a rule of thumb, calculate the tx size like that:
* Base size is 10 bytes
* For each input add 148 bytes
* For each P2PKH output (starts with 1) add 34 bytes
* For each P2SH output (starts with 3) add 32 bytes
Then, determine the fee rate (in satoshi per byte, satoshi=0.00000001 BTC).
The  shows how congested the network is, so pick the fee based on which ones disappear at the top of each block.
Another, somewhat broken, site is  , it gives good times during congestions.

Please step back from an inflamed opinion and do some research.
In btc1 code, the logic for bit 4 signaling is identical to BIP91. Which is, upon activation, to:
A. Signal SegWit over bit 1.
B. Reject blocks that won't signal it via bit 1.
So, once BIP91 activates, we will have a chain made up of 80%+ of prior hashrate that is signaling real SegWit and rejecting the other 20%. 100% segwit signaling, activation in 4 weeks.
And since (hopefully) no one but miners are crazy enough to use btc1 code, that will be the end of it and no meaningful hard fork in november.

It's more along the lines of why "smart contract" is a misnomer, as well as the what fundamental qualities blockchains has that make them meaningful.
Honestly, i'm having troubles thinking about practical applications as well. As a programmer i understand the concept and it's capabilities, but interfacing that with the real world is where all the open questions are.

Sounds about right.
Another edge case i forgot to mention is that older (2009-2012ish), vanitygen and a few other odd types of addresses can be uncompressed, in which case the size of the input would be 180 instead of 148.
On a paper wallet, it's compressed if private key starts with K or L, and uncompressed if it starts with 5. 
So if you are thus unlucky, the size would be 1940.

Coinbase is not a wallet, it's a bank. They can assign whatever fees they want.
Bitcoin itself does have fees as well, which act as a priority indicator. The faster you want the money to get transferred, the higher the fee should be. If there aren't many transactions, the fee would be low regardless. Is the network is choked full, then the largest-fee transactions would be completed first.
The fee goes to the miners, the ones who create blocks. In technical terms, the fee is the difference between total value of inputs and total value of outputs. If you haven't dug that deep yet, just consider it as a transaction parameter.
Decentralization is not about fees, really. it's about censorship resistance. The core value of Bitcoin is that you can send or receive money, and no force can prevent that. For this property to hold, the network should be scattered all over the world in equal manner. If Bitcoin becomes centralized it would be just a shitty version of Paypal, and Paypal is better at being Paypal than Bitcoin.

It's a one-way street. The mathematics are such that computing the public key (the address) given the private key is trivial, while computing the private key given the address is effectively impossible. Keyword is "public key cryptography".
So, you generate a private key offline using a random number generator and that's your wallet. The only case when the addresses get repeated is if your random number generator is bad.

@_date: 2017-07-02 14:07:11
TL;DR: It's an 8 Mb hardfork disguised as a 2Mb one, and it is set to activate after any Segwit activation method, even if the 2x proposal fails. That is, the Jihan camp can boycott Segwit part and still get their hardfork when it activates by other means.

336 is the activation period for BIP91, 1000 is for BIP141. Included for completeness and perspective.
I don't think there are enough blocks left in the current period to activate it, so it won't go up in it. After that it would be as you described - give or take some luck, squeezing or one extra pool.

I still don't get what you have in mind.
As it is, 2009 is 0 Hz and mid-2017 is 11 KHz. The big peak of where most of the coins are is moving up the scale, corresponding to the ever-increasing pitch.
You can also hear powerline-like hum from the Satoshi's stash left in 2009 and various noises from other large addresses being left behind.

Beliefs are irrelevant in such cases.
Here is the Ethereum price: 
Here is the ETC price: 
Notice how they stayed close to 10:1 relationship all the time.
True, ETC went up to $2, and thus 5:1, briefly after the fork in a pump-and-dump, but then settled back to $1 range.
Similar might happen with Bitcoin forks - there would be pumps and dumps of the minority chains, and a shrewd trader can win on them, but you won't just automatically double your money.

Here is a nice flowchart for it: 
In short - the NYA "segwit2x" is made out of BIP91 and 2xHF. The former would activate segwit nicely and defuse the BIP148 forkbomb. Then, in november, there might be a battle over the latter.

On the technical side, you should be looking for a file called wallet.dat on a computer, or for a piece of paper/file that has 12 to 24 random words. To access bitcoin you need a key, and that key is held by the owner, and looks like that.
It might be password protected, in which case that's it. But it often isn't.
If they find something like that, best to hold on to it, get educated on how these things work and then decide what to do with it.

For an actual company like Google, they would have to show the shareholders a way to make profit out of what would be a lot of very expensive (half-a-million BTC or 1.5-2 billion USD in a rough estimate) shenanigans, and it would mark them as absolute evil in an instant, so it's quite unlikely.

I'm trying to wrap my head around why you say it's a lot of effort for a small gain. It sounds like a few hours of effort spent per person, and as you said there are people who would have sent them 1 BTC or more, which translates to hundreds if not thousands of $ per hour. 
That's one hell of an income. Even your case of $150 sounds like well above minimum wage.

I don't get it. Why would a node have to share hardware with e-commerce software or with checkout places? The nodes generate invoices and can send them whereever needed over secure channels, i.e. to a PoS terminal. The payment would then arrive from some random direction of the internet to the node, which can then inform whatever processing backend you have of a successful transaction.
I don't see what kind of architecture are you talking about and what is it that is "hardwired".

The "HODL" things you hear? That's the key word for long term investment. Long term 2+ years at least, decade on average. If you believe in the tech, then that's the time scales you should look at not at short term price motions and boom-bust cycle.
That said, try this: Imagine that instead of buying BTC you took the money and burned it. All you have now is ashes in a bottle. How does that make you feel? Are you desperate to get them back? Is there now a pressing need for cash? In short, was it something you could afford to lose? If not, if you really need the money, do sell.
From the sound of it, you aren't in any such desperate need, since you haven't missed the money over a year. If so, it makes a lot of sense to keep on holding - the internet wasn't built in a day, and markets do go down as well as up.

Your best bet is to get a good grasp of the tech involved, to have an intuitive understanding on why and when storing coins on exchanges is bad or good (IOUs, past exchange hacks, difficulties of securing a wallet yourself, malware if you use Windows, etc), what happens when a chain is split (where are the coins "stored", confirmation times, replay attacks, 51% and delayed block attacks, etc), what is SegWit and what it's effects are ("transaction malleability", "lightning network", ECDSA in general) and so on. Look up Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split ("Dao Hack"), and what the inter-chain dynamics and attacks were back then - something similar might happen here as well in the worst case.
Understand that without developers a cryptocurrency is dead and without economic use a cryptocurrency is dead. Coins with active development teams have historically done much better than coins with active moral or political stands but few active developers.
TL;DR: A good strategy would be to make a cold wallet, secure it, invest as much as you can afford to lose, hide the wallet and it's copies in safe places and forget about it for some years. The coins would weather the storm just fine that way, and you won't be tempted to try to sell or play the markets.

First, the value of Bitcoin is in censorship resistance. The larger the blocks are, the harder it is to run a full node. The harder it is to run a node, the less nodes there are.
Get the blocks big enough (you yield once, you yield every time), and the nodes would only exist in big datacenters, easily manipulated.
At that point Bitcoin would turn into a shitty PayPal clone, and PayPal is better that Bitcoin at being PayPal.
Second, increasing block size does not solve any scaling problems. It only offer linear growth, while Bitcoin must grow exponentially if it is to consume things like money. For exponential growth you need off-chain solutions.

Moscow, Russia. In the big city, a decent apartment can be on the order of $100k, a house with a plot of land an hour away would be $10k-$30k. Get to St Petersburg, and it's half the price. Get to a provincial city, and it's even less (but so are the incomes, Moscow averages $6k, good IT job pays $20-30k here).
Mortgages were only made legal around 1999, and went out of fashion quickly in 2008, so the prices had been slowly deflating since then. However, you'd still realistically need one to be able to afford a place.
$30k would last for decades in the countryside on a diet of ramen and depression, but if you live in a city and have to pay rent it wouldn't last past a couple of years.

Remember the "change my mind guy behind the desk" meme? To alter Bitcoin, you need to convince about 100 thousand of them, many of which would be paying attention and alerting the rest of any shenanigans noticed.


An idea proposed would get discussed and worked out, if it got some merit it would be presented as a BIP (  ), that would been open to review and discussion for a while, and if everyone agree it's a good idea the code would be written and offered to the above mentioned 100k node owners.

Thing is, there aren't that many different things to "vote" for there. Either the pool is honest and supports your preferred rule set or not.


Yep, that was the original idea. Unfortunately, Satoshi didn't have a good feel for exponential growth, so his initial design didn't survive even the modest scaling in many ways.
Ethereum tried the hardest to get back to that idea, but even their 15 sec, ASIC-resistant blocks failed at scale to provide pool-less mining after a while.
It's just PoW logistics - either you drown in transactions/blocks or you scale way out of range of acceptable timeframes for PoW reward for individual.

Maybe, maybe not, since these are different use cases.
Bitcoin is a UTXO design, which makes it inefficient for having a contract-style operation on top.
Ethereum, on the other hand, is a state database design, which is optimized for smart contract style operation.
A killer app would have been a way to make secure inter-operation between the two (kind of how RSK is supposed to work with it's own blockchain pegged to Bitcoin), which is a rather difficult problem at this stage since neither were designed for it.
We'll see, i guess.

If you invest, invest for the long haul (known here as HODL). Odds are good that Bitcoin would survive the scaling war one way or another, and it would continue to grow in value over the years. So long as you don't move your coins no potential forks and perturbations would affect them. Read up on the technology - the whole thing is charmingly simple once you understand the ideas behind a hash function, a digital signature and an old spam reduction thingy called hashcash.
In short, if you can afford it you should. Don't expect to make a profit near-time (that is, don't invest what you can't afford to miss for a few years just in hopes of doubling it over a week), don't be scared of the price dropping for some time (look at the whole price graph over the decade - it does some crazy ups and downs, but general trend is up).

Basically if someone was to sell enough to wipe out the whole order book on an exchange it can drop the price there to arbitrary low number for a few seconds.

That's not easily predictable, since we are talking about a situation decades from now.
Mining is likely to be an ambient activity by then, embedded into water heaters and warming blankets, profit from it being a product price reduction trick rather than a break even endeavor. To 51% attack *that* you'd need to outpace the world's consumer product economy or be able to hack everything down to the last smart kettle.
Bitcoin might also be costing millions of dollars apiece by then, making even tiny fees worth the miner's while. Then the cost of 51% attack would remain high as well.
We might also see completely unexpected problems and completely unexpected solutions to then over that kind of time frame. It's longer than modern internet have been around, for example.

What you describe is pretty much how a mining pool works, only without clogging the chain with millions of mining transactions each block.
The pools are not that much of a problem, really, since they can't cheat - little to no trust is involved and everything can still be verified. 
The problem is where single entities like ASIC manufacturers pretend to be pools while running it all by themselves, which could accumulate a significant share of hashrate.
However that problem is also getting solved over time - we are past the peak centralization of mining by now. The chips are close to the best silicon processes known now, and can no longer scale exponentially in performance, making miners last longer and making it harder and harder for a single entity to acquire enough hardware.

Far from full coverage, no way to have your node contribute to the network, no way to broadcast transactions.

@_date: 2018-12-10 03:03:51
Think of it as a method for large scale aggregation of microtransactions.
Instead of broadcasting your transaction to everyone, you fund smart contracts with peers once and transact by exchanging and routing signed transactions that spend this contract's outputs. These transactions are not broadcast to the blockchain unless settlement is required.
At no point do you take off, sell, exchange or in any other way lose control of your coins, it all happens on top of and within the rules of Bitcoin.

They do orbit the Earth, but these are located at such an altitude that it takes them 24 hours to do an orbit, thus making them appear to stay in one place over the surface of the planet.
It's called a geostationary orbit and it lets a single satellite cover most of a hemisphere 24/7. The drawback is that they are very far away, so you need a large dish antenna to receive and even larger one to transmit.
For comparison, GPS/GLONASS and Iridium networks are in lower orbits, and to achieve the same 24/7 coverage they need 33/26 and 72 satellites respectively. On the plus side, the receiver is just a chip in a phone.

Also, i feel like SegWit is going to make this harder - iterating through signatures allow you to change txid without changing the content of the transaction, while with it you would have to alter the transaction data itself in some way, i.e. by varying the fee.

Kinda. A CME can't really knock out more than one hemisphere, and is only really a threat to cheap ground return electrical grids of the sort they have in North America. It's going to wreak havoc, but not send us to stone age. At least nowhere near all of us.
Bitcoin would only be affected if there would be large-block internet fragmentation, i.e. if all communications between the americas and eurasia were to be cut.

You might be joking, but i talked to people working on Bitcoin regulations in Russia, and the general idea is to work with the technology while exonerating the state, rather than trying to ban it.

Had a similar problem with early Litecoin wallet. Ended up recreating the conditions under which i made that wallet as close as i could, meditating at it for some time to get back to the state of mind i should have had as i set the password, then writing a brute-forcer to go through all the potential password schemes i could think of after all of that. Success was had.

On the technical side, check Bitcoin Core changelogs. 
In short:
-Segwit update went live in 2017 allowing for 2-3x the tx capacity, new address format and a new subset of smart contracts.
-The latter enabled things like Lightning Network, which is a peer-to-peer aggregation of microtransactions. It went live a year ago. 
-Standards have been drawn for Schnorr signatures, but they are not live yet.
-There was a lot of work on private transactions, but these have to be launched all at once to be of use and are not live yet.
-The chain is approaching 200Gb in size, and runs at capacity all the time, so you need about 13 Gb of data per month in order to run a node.
-ASIC miners are approaching a plateau, having reached the 7-15 nm chip range and the Moore's law limits with them. No more "10x better miner in 6 months" bs, which means it's now conceivable that we might see infrastructure-scale mining projects soon (i.e. household radiator-shaped miners and mining water heaters).
Price-wise, there have been another speculative bubble fueled by ICOs on Ethereum and all the related noise. It popped a year ago and things had been quiet since then. We are in the "working in peace" phase of the boom-bust cycle right now.
Along with the bubble there have been a gross overload of on-chain transaction capacity, with fees spiking to $20-$40/tx in Dec 2017, which prompted many of the bigger businesses like Valve to drop Bitcoin payment support.
On politics side:
-ETFs and like are still a month away, like they were back in 2013.
-Most recent scare story is how Bitcoin mining would boil the oceans, based on clueless extrapolation of it's energy use and relation to transaction count.
-A few old-timey scammer got together and launched an altcoin called "Bitcoin Cash", capitalizing on people not understanding the broadcast nature of Bitcoin network and trying to sell it as Bitcoin to newcomers. They made some noise back in late 2017, but had little traction and are chewing each other's throats these days.
-Governments are getting wise to the game, i.e. attempts are made to blacklist Iran's Bitcoin addresses as part of the sanctions package
-Not sure when that happened, but in USA every Bitcoin transaction is now a capital gains tax taxable event. In general, most countries have figured out how they would or wont tax Bitcoin by now
That's most of the things that come to mind.

Being from a country with a median income of about $2k-$4k A YEAR, i tend to disagree.
Here in Moscow you can buy (no mortgages) a nice apartment in a good location for about $100-$150k, with maintenance and utilities cost of about $1500 a year. Plus $500 a year for food and necessities mean that all your survival needs are covered by $2k a year, leaving you with $8k of disposable income. Which is kinda hard to spend without being wasteful.
Still, $330k won't be enough to retire completely, but it would let you forget about having to work for money for a while, hopefully giving you time and peace of mind to work for your own interests and start generating income off of it.

Actually, it's 109 bytes per transaction, including signature (which is 65 bytes on it's own and does not contain an explicit public key thanks to some neat ECC math).
To transmit that transaction, you also need to send only these 109 bytes, besides the stuff like encrypted channel framing.
So i don't see where you are getting the 1000 bytes figure from.

There are no local warehouses for Amazon in Russia, so it's an international delivery, which rarely takes less than a month regardless of how much you pay. That assuming the customs lets things through - i tried getting a Kindle a few years ago, and it was refused entry because it contained a cryptographic device (a wifi module). Had to get one via China. In general, having things delivered within a few days, much less hours, is largely unheard here even for local online stores.
So, Amazon is essentially an obscure UK book store around here. Been buying books from them a couple of times a year before getting a kindle.

Satoshi didn't anticipate a lot of things. He was surprised when mining went to GPUs and FPGAs, he didn't expect prices to go high enough that 8 decimal point division would not be enough, he expected the network to scale slowly enough that block size increases in line with bandwidth grow would be enough, he expected SPV to work fine along with a network of fully validating datacenters, he didn't anticipate Snowden's reveals and strong need for privacy and so on.
In the end, he was quite obviously human with all the human flaws and a bad sense for exponential growth, and it shows in his original design. Fortunately, he wasn't working on it alone and people have picked up the idea and kept improving on it over the last decade, trying to make that original promise work.
Lightning Network is a way to aggregate microtransactions at scale on Bitcoin, it's an open standard designed by a collaboration of developers, with several compatible implementations currently live. Satoshi was no longer around to comment on it, but he did mention something similar might happen one day early on.
Blockstream made Liquid, a trusted-party side chain for quick liquidity transfer between things like exchanges, it's not related to Lightning Network.

Yes, a wallet is a set of keys. It does not matter how many ones you have - if you use the same keyphrase on the PC you would create a wallet that got access to the same coins. The two won't interere with each other.
Be aware that it might not be particularly secure - if you lose your phone or get your PC stolen, you will lose it all, while having separate wallets with separate backups lets you only lose a part of the whole.
Also, right now the network have decongested and the fees are quite small - a good window of opportunity to move assets around at low cost.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:48:24
Sadly, wallets are encrypted with some real security. When i was brute-forcing my Litecoins, it did about a password *per second*, since the algorithm is designed in such a way as to take a lot of time per try, exactly to prevent brute-forcing.
So, anything over 3-4 symbols is essentially un-bruteforceable. You'll need a dictionary attack instead, based on the password generation schemes and ideas typically used by the person who made the password.

Fundamentally it's not a problem and would be equivalent to a certain deflation rate. The divisibility limit can be easily fixed (well, segwit-grade "easy") by changing the value field to 256 bits from the current 64 bits, and on it goes gown the ladder of orders of magnitude.

There is no such thing as "blockchain technology", it's a bit of technobabble invented by Vitalik Buterin to undermine Bitcoin.
In practice there is maybe 4 other cryptocurrencies that are actually working well, and 1-2 of them that are meaningfully secure. The rest is noise, speculations, copycats, scams, tokens, you name it.
As a result, most of these are listed and traded in terms of BTC, so when BTC goes up and down their "USD prices" follow the curve.

Something to the effect of "no one cares" on the casual user level.
A lot of business got scared away by the initial claims of banning, but by 2016 you can freely buy and sell BTC again.
Honestly, i don't know what sort of reaction would there be if i were to, for example, try to sell a dozen BTC and file a honest income tax report.

On A, anyone can make arbitrary amount of copies of any person. If we would still have jobs, then everyone would "pirate" people and exploit them, rather than "hire" anyone. On the other hand, identity becomes a loose concept since you are now a class of people composed out of a set of closely related copies of yourself rather than a single entity. This might not be bad in itself, but there is one small step from that to an undifferentiated hivemind, which is unlikely to be fun.
On homomorphic encryption, i think i read that it was proven to be impossible in a general case. At least in Ethereum it's considered a major open problem - how do you make a smart contract that would contain private code and not show that code to anyone looking at it. 
In any case, there are no practical solutions to it yet, and it won't prevent the hackers from leaking encryption keys along with people or the lawmakers from making laws that whichever enforcing powers there would be would enforce.

Hm, a standard way of getting k is to derive it from the message hash and private key (known as RFC 6979). So for any set of key and message there would always be a unique k. What i did is to then add a counter to it. The only way this can result in k reuse is if i were to send the same exact transaction twice, which won't be accepted by the network in any case.
