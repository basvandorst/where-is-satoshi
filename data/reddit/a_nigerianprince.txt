Well I started mining a couple of days ago, I calculated winnings of $1 per day... I don't think it's worth it for the effort I'm putting my gpu through, besides it already gets pretty hot if I'm gaming or something...
I did look at some mining rigs to purchase with a friend, but BTC is worth about half of what it was worth when I looked at those, and it was only yesterday.

Heh I don't think I'd sell if I were you. Of course I'm not sitting on 5 BTC. In fact, nevermind, I must have one of the less trust inspiring usernames in reddit.

Bitcoins are nigerian princes wet dreams.
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:22:26
That sounds like a dare.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:54:00
Nigerian princehood is a state of mind friend.

Hey guy, I was here before you. Why you steppin' on my turf?
@_date: 2013-05-06 08:51:17
ridiculous. thanks to guys like you, bitcoin users are coming off as spoiled brats who absolutely have to get their way or else...
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:29:50
Yeah, I think that's the way to go. The sooner we start looking at this as an actual payment method instead of a get rich scheme, the better.
*edit* or what whollyhemp said
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:41:40
No more giving the D, now it's all about the BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:21:15
Nice. That image looks like the wet dream of the nigerian princes of tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:54
I bought some today, a tiny amount yes, but I'm interested in trying out btc in actual purchases... I don't make enough money to actually invest in this, but the concept is interesting nonetheless.
That said, people are going nuts today...
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:08:55
I think that's for GMP, op linked MGMP
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:24:49
Are bitcoins still regarded as an easy way to get rich? Turning 1 BTC into 1000 probably isn't the right question.
Hey I could be wrong though, still new around here.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:42:00
You guys can actually login? I have sms authentication also so...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:02
Hey man, be happy your part of something new and exciting ;) I know what you mean though.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:28:47
Will do :)
@_date: 2013-04-26 11:08:20
What's next? They apologize.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:27:29
[I don't know anything anymore](
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:15:52
That's nice to hear. Around here people are partying like it's 1929
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:09:15
Congratulations mate. Just started reading about bitcoins recently, it's inspiring when you read stuff like this. Best of luck to you.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:23:45
You guys wonder why people don't take you serious...
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:09:11
Makes you feel small
@_date: 2013-04-20 11:23:35
In Latvia you can no eat bitcoin. But eat potato you can. But no potato in Latvia.

That movie may or may not have been based on me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:02:06
Well guess who isn't going to receive the opportunity to become a millionaire.
Yeah Gary that's you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:35:03
I'm sorry for that, it was probably my cousin.
