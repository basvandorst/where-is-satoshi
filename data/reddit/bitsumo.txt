Hi, have you heard of [BitSumo]( We've been operating since June and are able to fill that void!

Yes, the operator is based in Bolivia. Is there any reason other than racism why this would be a problem through?
BitSumo has been operating since June and have successfully processed many orders. Some customers have left comments in this [bitcointalk thread]( if you'd like to read about their experiences.

I get what you are saying about corruption, but this is bitcoin we're talking about. Bitcoinica was registered as a financial service provider in New Zealand (the country ranked number 1 on the list you linked) and that didn't exactly end well, Bitcoin Savings and Trust was based in U.S., so was BitSpend. I am yet to see any bitcoin scams come out of Somalia, North Korea, or Afghanistan (the countries ranked bottom equal).
But yes, trust is very important in business. Especially bitcoin based business. Trust in BitSumo is growing as more customers share their positive experiences. Only a small proportion of customers leave any kind of public feedback (that's ok, they are allowed anonymity), you can see some in the BitSumo thread on [bitcointalk]( or even a few comments on this submission. :)
The operator of BitSumo also owns butter-bot.com ([bitcointalk thread]( he definitely has proven trust and reliability.

Challenge accepted! ;)
Over at [BitSumo.com]( we charge only 2.5%, plus $3 per order. all4btc.com may be slightly cheaper for smaller orders, however we guarantee order processing within 24 hours (it's usually a lot faster), forward you tracking details (when available from merchant), and are able to process high order volumes.

Thanks for the mention. Our fee structure is indeed more favourable for more expensive orders (just over $100) compared to all4btc. However we feel our speedy processing and ability for customers to track their order makes up for the slightly increased fees in smaller orders.
Since the closure of BitSpend, sales have been increasing rapidly (we've had a recent round of financing to enable us to keep up with demand) but we're always looking to introduce new customers to our service. I might make a submission similar to this to spread the word to :)
