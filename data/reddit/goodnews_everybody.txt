Either you're someone who's actually involved in trading Bitcoin in some capacity, or I probably don't need to hear your Bitcoin investing advice.
Or let me say the same about something else: Either you're someone who's actually involved in trading stocks in some capacity, or I probably don't need to hear your stock investing advice.
If you're at the point of "I don't trust the entire bitcoin ecosystem", then I don't think you understand it well enough to give qualified analysis on its long term investment potential. And yes, there are plenty of people who don't trust the stock market, either.
As an example, when someone compares Bitcoin to the tulip craze. I understand the economic example they're making, but there are some very real differences between Bitcoins and tulips. If you can't identify them, I won't consider your opinion on the subject valid.
Now, if someone showed up on this thread who had fully examined their options for short selling and come to the conclusion that the current marketplaces are inherently too risky, I would love that. It'd be an excellent comment. Instead, just read what people have written below...
They're not interested in Bitcoin as an investment or anything else. They're only interested in as a place where they can come and troll and act superior, then I assume disappear if they're ever proven wrong. That's not someone I'm going to be taking investing advice from.

If you've ever shopped at Target, they lost your data and you're at risk of ID theft. As a result, they're offering to pay for 1 year of credit monitoring and insurance for every customer they've ever had.
Since the insurance covers you no matter the source of the ID theft, it'll also cover you against theft from MtGox, your personal computer being hacked, your physical wallet being stolen, etc.
In short: if you qualify for it, your identity was already lost by Target. So sign up for the free protection they're offering.

Didn't this most recent conflict start when 3 Israeli teenagers were killed by Hamas?
The key distinction between Israel and Hamas for me is this: If Hamas had the ability, they would kill every Jewish person on the planet. It's part of their mission statement.
But even though Israel does have the ability to kill every Palestinian, they aren't. 
Rather than exclusively shelling the territory from aircraft and drones, Israel is sending troops at great risk of harm to themselves to execute surgical strikes against Hamas militants and weapons depots. The reason they're putting boots on the ground is solely to minimize civilian casualties.

You can invest in companies that make money through Bitcoin, as long as you feel that they will be able to apply their business model to any cryptocoin.
@_date: 2014-07-23 09:24:49
It's not about how many casualties you've suffered and trying to keep your enemies casualties under that number, but about the military advantage gained by taking out the hostage taker.
If the hostage taker has his finger on a button that will cause millions of deaths and by killing him you've stopped him from following through, then 4 civilian casualties is a very small number in comparison to the lives you've saved (I'm assuming you tried to avoid harming the civilians and were simply unable to or there was no other way).
Unfortunately, I don't think the public really has enough information about the situation on the ground to determine whether the number of civilian losses is large or small in comparison to the cost of not hitting those targets.
However, we do know for sure that the use of human shields in warfare is a war crime, and on that basis we can say that Hamas is violating international law during the course of this conflict, and the international community should demand that their leaders be brought to justice before an international tribunal or war court.

That's pretty much the system as it is.
Lets say someone purchases a television from Best Buy using a stolen credit card, what happens is BB ships out the TV, then a week or so later the credit card network informs them that the transaction was fraudulent and they will not be receiving any money from that sale.
The consumer who held the card isn't liable for that loss, but neither is the credit card network. So who's left holding the bag for the cost of that television? Best Buy.
If, on the other hand, the credit card companies devised a technological way to prevent fraud, the whole situation could've been avoided and the only loser would be the criminal who won't get their "free" TV.
Edit: Clarity.

I wouldn't have down voted you for this. There are plenty of banks that don't suck so much, and credit unions are a pretty great option, too.
The only reason why shitty banks like BofA and WellsFargo continue to exist is because most consumers don't shop their bank accounts. They go with whomever is convenient or has the best commercials and never compare their options.
I tell people all the time about Fidelity and they're shocked by what you get with their accounts. No minimums, no monthly fees, free use of any ATM anywhere (they refund any fees you're charged), free checks, free debit card, they pay interest on your balance, free app check depositing, free self-funded overdraft, 2% unlimited cash back on everything with their credit card, and they're also a full service broker. Sign up is completely online and, from what I can remember, was extremely fast and easy.
Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever paid a fee to them for anything other than standard investment stuff (for purchasing stock or holding mutual funds, etc).

The reason there's so much collateral is because Hamas is storing weapons under schools and hospitals. So no matter what kind of conflict goes on around those weapons, there are going to be massive civilian casualties.
This is, of course, what Hamas wants. They're willing to see their children killed in order to win a media victory. As a father, I'm sure that repulses you more than anything else about this conflict. Imagine your own government placing your child in the line of fire, letting them be killed, then broadcasting footage of their dead body on TV to drum up support for their political goals. It's atrocious.
It should also be noted that Hamas is specifically targeting civilians in their strikes on Israel, rather than seeking out military targets. In contrast to Israel, which is trying to get at the weapons hid behind civilians.
@_date: 2014-07-23 07:20:47
I'm sorry, but if you put your children in front of your weapons at a time of war and they end up dead, you killed them.
I don't think Israel wants to kill children, and they certainly aren't happy about it with the negative attention it brings them. They'd much rather have this be a fight against terrorists and not kids.
But that's why Hamas is putting their children in the line of fire in the first place, because they're clearly benefiting from the outcry over their deaths. You yourself are less likely to support an aid organization that supports Israel because of it, and by doing that you're giving Hamas a win and reinforcing their tactics of using children as human shields.

The much more likely reality: An ISP like Comcast whitelists their own video streaming service for unlimited bandwidth while asking unaffordable high rates of competing services. This would guarantee the success of their internal ventures, but would dramatically stifle competition and innovation.
A truly open economy is one in which every member has equal opportunity for success. Businesses flourish or fail based on their own merits: how efficiently they operate, how desirable their product or service, etc.
But our economy is now largely online. To allow a corporation like Comcast to dictate which enterprises should be allowed to succeed and which are doomed to fail in the digital realm would be a tremendous assault on the free market.
It would be similar to allowing the electric company to pick and choose which businesses can receive electricity, or to charge significantly different rates to different companies arbitrarily. Or to allow them to provide free electricity to the Italian restaurant they happen to own while charging enormous rates to the other Italian restaurants in town.
Of course, this wouldn't be so much of an issue if we had any real choice in ISPs, but for most Americans there are only one or two ISPs providing service in their area. They may not be able to take their business elsewhere.

That would explain the huge fee discrepancy between Xapo and Elliptic (a London based insured Bitcoin vault).
Xapo charges .12% of the deposit per year. With a 10 BTC deposit, that's .012 BTC per year.
Elliptic charges 2% of the liability limit per year. With a 10 BTC deposit (assuming a liability limit that covers it all), that's .2 BTC per year.
At the current rate, here are the costs of storing 10 BTC with both:
- Xapo: $7.60 per year.
- Elliptic: $126.88 per year.
That's a huge difference. Coupled with the copious spelling and grammatical errors on their site, I'm thinking they might not be as safe as they're purporting.

Swap out the USB memory sticks for M-DISCs and make sure your paper backups are printed on acid-free (sometimes called archival) paper.
An M-DISC is a DVD on which your data was engraved in a "rock-like" layer. It's far more durable than a normal DVD, standing up to heat, moisture, and time better than any other digital storage medium you'll be able to get your hands on. Estimates are that they'll last 1,000 years without data loss.
And the best part is that they're cheap. You'll need a special M-DISC compatible burner, which should only be about $25 on Amazon, and 10 blank discs, which will run you about $30. Total price: $55.
In short, they're head-and-shoulders above a USB thumb drive for data archival, especially if you're concerned with things like long-term bit rot or the potential for data loss due to natural disaster.
Note: They now offer Blu-Ray M-DISCs. They're more expensive than DVD M-DISCs and if all you're using it for is a Bitcoin wallet, you certainly won't need the extra space. So purchase accordingly.

So if I walk into a bookstore and walk out with a book I didn't pay for, that's theft. But if I bypass Amazon's payment restrictions and get an ebook I didn't pay for, that's not theft?
Or rather, if a store is offering me a free physical book provided I watch a 30 second video ad, and I take the book and leave without watching the ad, that's theft? But if they offered an eBook after watching an ad and I bypassed the ad, that's not theft?

Because then they'd have to cover the loss instead of the retailer, which means increasing their fees to compensate, which means less retailers would accept their card, which means they'd have to increase fees further, which means less retailers would accept their card, and repeat until they're out of business.
The only workable solution is for them to develop technology that completely prevents fraud before it happens. But that would cost them money, probably more money than the current cost of fraud to them. It's a cost/benefit thing.

I disagree. I think the person giving the criticism matters immensely, at least when it comes to the level of detail and factual support I'd require of that criticism.
If tomorrow Satoshi Nakamoto himself sent a somehow-verified tweet saying "There's a problem with Bitcoin that can't be fixed and it'll have to be completely scrapped", I'd sell all of my coins.
But if Professor Bitcorn published a 50,000 page well-researched, annotated treatise detailing what he claims is an unfixable problem within Bitcoin, I'd probably ignore it.
All OP did was demonstrate some typos and name variants. That's not what I'd call a well reasoned technical criticism of DNS, a system which works extremely well at making web browsing possible for everyday use, or OneName, which works the same way.
So if he has any expertise in making financial products either consumer friendly or more secure, that'd help the credibility of his prediction. 
Or he could find something substantiating his belief that fat fingers will be a problem in digital financial transactions; maybe a study on the number of PayPal users who've accidentally sent money to the wrong merchant because of typos (though I suspect that rarely occurs, if ever).

Well, it's certainly not as secure as a truly random 64 byte key, but is it secure in the sense that it would be impractical for someone to brute force it?
If my computer can process one password every 2.5 minutes, then I would only be able to guess 210,240 potential passwords per year. With 95 possibilities for each character in the password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters), a 15 character password has 4.6e+29 possibilities.
So if you follow the math through, and assume that I only need to guess 50% of the possible passwords before finding the right one, it would take my computer 1.1e+24 years to stumble upon the hash of a 15 character password run through this script.
However, I'm wondering if there isn't a way to compute the hashes far more quickly than my CPU can, like with an ASIC, FPGA, or just GPU? That would change the math.
Edit: Well, damn. This math is only accurate if the salt is known by the attacker. With an unknown salt, as is likely, it would take significantly longer than 1.1e+24 years to brute force discover one of these keys.

It limits their liability separate from a loss backed by their insurance policy. 
If your insured coins are lost or stolen, their insurance reimburses you for the loss, but Xapo itself is only liable for damages equal to what you've paid them in fees.
So let's say you've store some Bitcoins with Xapo. You have 10 BTC in their insured vault and 1 BTC in their wallet for easy spending. Then Xapo gets hacked and loses everything.
The company Xapo insured their vaults with will reimburse you for the 10 BTC you've lost from your vault. But as for the other 1 BTC you had in their wallet, well, that you'd have to sue for and may be limited by what they've put in their TOS.
That is my understanding of things, but if someone gets it better, please correct me.

More like: a guy attacked you, then took a hostage. He keeps firing at you. Eventually he'll hit you and he's not stopping. So you try to kill him without killing the hostage but fail and the hostage ends up dead along with the guy. You tried to avoid the hostage, but weren't able to.
If it were me, I'm sure I'd feel the guilt of that for the rest of my life. But only because I wasn't skilled enough to avoid harming the hostage. Since the alternative would've been my death, I'd know that I was justified in defending myself. And I'd take comfort in the fact that this guy is not going to kill anyone or take anyone else hostage again.
So to carry this metaphor through, you'd just want Israel to let themselves get shot up instead of mounting a defense against those you admit are war criminals to protect the lives of the people the war criminals have put in harm's way? 
That's a nice philosophy, but a quick way to find yourself dead and your nation destroyed in an armed conflict with a determined enemy hell bent on your genocide.

That's not really what happened here. PBKDF2 is secure, I didn't write it myself.
The salt simply adds entropy, and ensures that passwords are of sufficient length. It also limits the usefulness of rainbow tables, so that if someone had precomputed password hashes with a given salt, that list would have to be completely recomputed for any new salts.
If you were storing user passwords in a database, ideally each account would have a different salt. But that's almost certainly what would happen with this program. Each person who downloads it is supposed to pick a salt for themselves. That salt only applies to their account, and baring some extreme misfortune, is most likely unique to them.
But a salt isn't some complicated, mystical thing. It's really just an extra string added on to the password. So if you have a 15 character password, and a 5 character salt, you really have a 20 character password that gets put through the algorithm.
Ultimately all of Bitcoin is vulnerable to what you're alluding to: ultra-fast computers of the future that can blow through encryption like it's nothing. 
Take a look at Armory. Each wallet is based off a single seed that is just a chain of random dictionary words. But there are enough words, and enough possible words in the dictionary, that any seed is essentially unguessable with today's technology. 
But sure, with a fast enough computer, you could run through each combination of dictionary words until you've found every Armory wallet in existence.
However, a computer fast enough to do that is many, many, many years away. And likewise, a computer fast enough to compute 20 million PBKDF2 hashes in the time it currently takes to compute 1 SHA-256 hash (about 1 50 millionth of a second) is also many, many, many years away.
Now, let's talk SHA-256 vs PBKDF2...
If you had a completely random 10 character password and I was trying to guess it, would I be more likely to guess the password if I could try 1 potential password per minute, or 50 million potential passwords per second?
Well, I would be much more likely to find your password if I could guess 50 million times per second. 
And thanks in part to Bitcoin mining (which is really just the computation of SHA-256 hashes), there is hardware out there than can compute SHA-256 even faster than that. So given the choice, why use only 1 iteration of SHA-256?
But this is silly, really. Of course you're going to be safer with millions of iterations and a more complex algorithm than you'd be without. Just put in a random string, exactly like you'd do with SHA-256 alone, and enjoy the bonus security.

Quantum entanglement. Here's my armchair physics explanation:
When two subatomic particles are entangled, their rotations oppose. One spins one way, the other spins the other way.
The cool thing is that if you change the direction of rotation of one entangled particle, it's partner will instantaneously switch rotation to stay opposed no matter what the physical distance is between them. It could be a few meters or millions of light years.
This phenomenon can be used to transmit binary information instantaneously across any distance.

You could make a poor-man's deterministic wallet by simply appending an incrementing number to your seed.
So your first address would use "correct horse battery staple 1".
Your second address would use "correct horse battery staple 2".
Your third address would use "correct horse battery staple 3".
And repeat. That way you can generate an infinite number of addresses from a single seed.

Better idea: If you personally don't want to view ads, then don't bitch about it and don't steal content. Simply stop visiting websites that make money with ads.

Don't betting chips obviate those issues? 
Like, you walk into a casino and say "Give me $100 in chips". And they say "Ok, that'll be X BTC at the current exchange rate". You exchange BTC for chips and head off to make your wagers.
When you cash out, you show up with your chips, let's say you did well and you've now got $200 in chips, and you say "Here's my $200 in chips, give me $200 worth of BTC for them." They give you X BTC at whatever the exchange is then, and you go about the rest of your day.

Israel can't "not play", since that would mean getting hit by rockets every day. If Hamas launches attacks against Israel, Israel has to retaliate to defend its citizens.

I've had my Coinbase account emptied when they somehow allowed my API key to be compromised (I'd never used it or copied it out off their site).
They denied it was their fault and I eventually gave up since it was only about $500 worth.
But a week or two afterwards, they emailed me to say they were admitting they might've been at fault and would refund the stolen BTC.
Whether you're ok with storing BTC in Coinbase depends on whether you'd be ok with this story happening to you.
Note: Since the time when this happened, they've really beefed up security and moved the API keys to an OAuth, permissions based system.

I agree with it being less safe than fiat. But only as a temporary problem.
If you want to protect traditional cash from theft, put it in a bank. Even if the bank goes bankrupt, FDIC will reimburse your loss.
But nothing with that level of simplicity currently exists for Bitcoin. You have to really understand what you're doing to keep it safe. For the vast majority of people, this means Bitcoin is riskier to store than fiat currency.
My own efforts to secure BTC prove this to me. I almost never think of the security of my fiat currency, but my Bitcoins are stored behind a complex online/offline setup that involved me purchasing a second computer. Sure, I could've printed an offline wallet without buying a new computer, but doing that safely requires creating a boot drive from a USB key and starting up with that... This is all too completed for the mainstream user.
And I can't even count how many times I've seen someone post on this subreddit after losing BTC to a random change address withdrawing from a paper wallet, or to have their balance emptied by a Chrome extension (or some other malware)... And that's what happening to us, a tech-savvy community of Bitcoin enthusiasts!
So while I'm a huge Bitcoin supporter, this is definitely a drawback to Bitcoin. But it's one that I suspect will be remedied in time as new companies and services come online.
Edit: I hope the down votes on this are just bots. Otherwise, would someone care to correct me?
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:13:20
Or just open  in a browser tab and let it run.
Every 10 seconds it'll generate and check a random Bitcoin address to see if it has any BTC stored in it.
It's entirely JavaScript based so you can audit the code and see that nothing is sent off your computer if you "win", and the only outgoing connection in the code is made to blockchain.info's API to query the address' balance.
Of course, you won't ever find an address with coins, the odds are so remote. But at least you won't have spent any money on an ASIC.
@_date: 2014-06-15 07:23:29
It seems your issue is simply a lack of willpower. Specifically, you do not have the willpower to hold your coins.
So turn that weakness into a strength.
Put your private keys somewhere that would require willpower to access: somewhere geographically inconvenient for you would work, provided that place is also secure. 
One option might be a safe deposit box at a branch of your bank that is several hours away (if they let you). If you want to avoid banks, you might consider a private vault.
Heck, you could even rent a PO Box somewhere far away from your home, mail the private key there, and just pay the bills on the box for the next 7 years without ever taking the mail out.
Likewise, a public storage place might have something small for document storage. I encourage you to explore your options.
If you choose something like a bank or PO Box, you'll certainly know about it ahead of time in the event they shut down, and you can just move your private keys somewhere else at that point. Or better yet, store multiple copies in several locations for redundancy.
(Maybe needless to say, but encrypting your private keys before storage is recommended.)
The advantage here is that if you really need your coins to the point where you'll drive many hours to get them, you have that option. But at the same time, you'll be less subject to impulsive withdraws because of that drive. And if you ever do head out one night to retrieve your keys, you'll have plenty of time to think about the wisdoms of your actions before arrival.

I've seen this before. It means they just started using CloudFlare and are making use of their SSL feature.
Unless they provide an SSL certificate of their own, they'll be assigned one by CloudFlare.
Either to save money or resources, CloudFlare assign multiple domains to the same SSL certificate.
Typically, this means CloudFlare will add new sites on to existing certificates.
In this case, CloudFlare has started serving the certificate before updating it with bitcoinwisdom's domain. This produces the error.
However, the error will disappear as soon as CloudFlare updates the certificate.
If you want to, you can probably use the site without a problem. (Assuming it's a genuine CloudFlare certificate.)

You can almost certainly get a secured Visa credit card, even with a truly awful credit score. 
With a secured card, you have to put up a certain amount of money as collateral, which then becomes your credit limit.
So if you give them $100 as collateral, you'll get a Visa credit card with a $100 limit. 
As a bonus, always paying that card's bill on time is a great way to rebuild your credit score.
Just Google "visa secured credit card" to find one.

I'm sure I'll get no love for this comment, but I can tell you how to become a millionaire with a pretty high probability.
Invest $300 a month in the stock market for 40 years. That's it.
The total out of pocket capital you'd invested would only be $144,000, but if you average an 8% interest rate and reinvest your proceeds, your investments would be worth slightly more than $1 million at the end of the 40 years.
8% is the approximate average long term return of the S&amp;amp;P 500.
If you have any money beyond the $300 a month you can spare, invest that in Bitcoin.
Edit: I should also mention that you can make these investments inside an IRA or 401k and your contributions will be tax deductible, lowering your current taxes and saving you even more money.

Well, there's a legal definition of caveat emptor that I was trying to bring out.
In the US, if you pay someone $100 for a cell phone, and the phone you receive doesn't run as smoothly as you thought it would, you have no legal recourse against the seller. You can't sue because "caveat emptor". You should've tried the phone in person before purchasing.
However, if you pay someone $100 for a cell phone and they never deliver it, that's fraud. You can take that person to court and they can not use caveat emptor as a defense.

That said, it typically takes several days for the money to transfer out of your bank and into the exchange. During that time, the bank can cancel the transaction if you notify them it is fraudulent.

Ads also pay to create the content you're viewing. To illustrate the point, let's extend your logic to other businesses...
Let's say I want a new television. 
But giving my credit card number to a retailer is dangerous. I could end up the victim of fraud. (Because not everywhere takes BTC yet.)
And it takes time to go through the payment process. I've gotta swipe my card and sign the receipt. That's annoying.
And if I wanted to also buy lunch, that's a second transaction I've gotta make, signing the receipt and risking my personal info. 
If I could but my TV and lunch in a bundle I'd do it. But otherwise it's just too much of a hassle.
Instead, I'll just use some code that let's me walk out of the electronics store with my new TV without paying for it. And then I'll use the same code at the restaurant later and grab some food for free, too.
Now, do you see the problem with your logic? It's not a clever way to improve the web browsing experience, it's theft.
If you don't like ads, your option is to stop reading websites that display them. If enough people agree with you and do the same, sites will have to develop new revenue models.
But blocking ads and reading the content anyway is theft, as clearly as walking into a bookstore and walking out with a book you didn't pay for.
Edit: Capitalization.

Your comment would've been better without that last line.
Generally speaking, people are more swayed by arguments than insults.
Even if your argument is a good one, throw in an unnecessary gibe at the end and you've more than likely lost the people you're trying to convince.
What are you, an idiot?
[See, this comment would probably be more effective at convincing you without the unnecessary last line gibe.]

I'm just going to throw this out there...
My Coinbase account was hacked. According to Coinbase, someone emptied it by initiating a transaction with my API key.
Since I'd never used the API key anywhere, or even copied it out of the website, I knew there had to have been a breach at Coinbase. As you can imagine, they denied it and blamed me.
I had pretty much written the coins off as a loss when, a couple weeks later, I got an email from someone at Coinbase informing me that they had discovered the hack probably was their fault with an offer to reimburse me for the lost BTC.
So in the end, they did the right thing. And without me having to threaten a lawsuit or protest in front of their offices. 
Since that event, I've noticed Coinbase has really stepped up their security. For example, requiring 2-factor for ANY transaction out of your account is an amazing new feature and should be mandatory.
I still use Coinbase to purchase BTC, and as a hot wallet for smaller amounts, but the bulk of my coins are stored in an online/offline Armory setup. 
Once you've lost coins in a heist, your opinions tends to shift towards eliminating essentially all risk of remote theft.

Well, you should spell check the Xapo website. Here's a list of spelling or grammar problems I've found (taken from a post I made yesterday):
This doesn't end in a period and says 'mayority'.


In this, 'transaction' should be plural.


This sentence uses the word 'you' twice when it should've used 'your', and 'error' should be plural to match 'actions'.


And this one wouldn't even pass a spell check.


Of course, if you were writing a personal cooking blog, none of this would matter. But you're asking people to trust you with their hard earned money. If there are that many careless mistakes visible to the user, how many careless mistakes have you made that we can't see?

That's what I'm doing, by taking in to consideration any relevant experience he may or may not have that might inform his argument.
I'd more readily accept the arguments of a Nobel laureate physicist on the nature of gravity than some guy who has an opinion on the subject.
And this particular guy's opinion is that Bitcoin addresses are better than aliases because it's too easy to fall for spoofing or make typos. And by his own example and logical extension, IP addresses are better than domain names because it's too easy to fall for domain spoofing or make typos.
However, that's crap. Bitcoin is a system for humans to use, much like DNS. And humans find it easier to remember and accurately type google.com than 123.42.2.11. When was the last time you visited a site on its naked IP? But if you only have a technical background with no business experience, the importance of that might be lost.
Of course, this alludes to an easy way to weed out weak or incomplete rationales: examine whether someone making an argument is qualified to make that argument. If not, they've probably missed something important in their line of reasoning.

@_date: 2013-12-15 11:03:36

@_date: 2013-12-15 10:50:55
Nope. I had the API key enabled, I suppose for some future project that I can't remember and never did, but never used one of the apps.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:55:25
Cool. I'm agent-free.

Wow, thanks. Looks like I have some homework...
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:19:34
This. Just because an app has access to the API, does not mean they should have access to transfer money out of our account. 
Twitter has a nice mechanism where you have to login to your account and specifically authorize an app to access your data. Coinbase could and should implement something similar.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:24:42
Mac only. :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:27:30
If that's so, it's pretty irresponsible of them not to warn people to disable the API key until the vulnerability is fixed.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:49:11
I'm pretty sure it was displayed when it was created.
Looks like all modern browsers may cache HTTPS content, unless told by the server not to: 
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:41:13
Only too happy to help, I guess... But I'm pretty satisfied with their response. I don't really know how they could've handled it better. Though it would be nice if enabling the API key wasn't such a huge security hole. I wont be turning that back on! But I will continue using them to buy/sell. The bulk of my coins will remain elsewhere.

Never logged in with anything but my home Mac. And keyloggers are out as the API key is not something I've ever typed. Nor could it have been lifted from my computer, as it was never stored on my computer. It's a mystery...
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:03:55
Never made it public, used it for anything, started working on anything with it, put it in Github, etc. I never even copied it out of Coinbase.

@_date: 2013-12-15 20:28:39
I know, but I have no other explanation. I did a Spotlight search for the (now disabled) API key, which would've found it if it was anywhere on my system (in an email, txt file, source code, etc.), and nothing was returned. And I've never accessed the account from any other machine.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:59:46
That would be a much simpler explanation. But Coinbase states the hacker got in through the API, and the only place the API key was stored was Coinbase's servers. I never used it with anything or even copied it out of the site.
My passwords remain secure, including my Coinbase password which was not used in an attempt to login to Coinbase (if it had been, I would've received an SMS with a 2-factor code).
I was also not the victim of a phishing attack. The only relatively recent email I received from Coinbase with a link pointed directly to Coinbase (was not masked or shortened in any way), and was sent to me *after* the theft, informing me of the BTC that had been transferred out of my account.
Additionally, a few other users have posted in this thread with similar experiences: a hacker got in through the API. That leads me to believe the vulnerability is server-side.
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:53:03
Which paper wallet is most reputable? I know Coinbase can generate them, but, well...
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:15:19
The API key never went anywhere, and I never did anything with it. I just figured that, since it's essentially a long "randomly" generated string, there'd be no harm in enabling it for a future project. After all, guessing the API key would be like guessing a secure password: difficult.
So I think there must be some critical weakness to the API keys... maybe they're predictable in some way.
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:54:04
Coinbase confirmed: it was hacked through the API.
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:42:01
Thanks. I disabled the API key. I never enabled auto login and have only logged in through my home desktop. But if they had access to that, then they would've had access to my full wallet and could've done a lot more damage.
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:22:33
Yes, though I did not enable it myself. Must be the default... It does say "No applications have been granted access."
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:29:34
Good questions to ask. But yeah, it's the real Coinbase. HTTPS identity verified and has all the correct history and payment info.

@_date: 2013-12-15 10:47:13
Still... how would they get the API key? Brute force?
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:12:29
Same thing. I don't specifically remember turning it on, but that seems like something I would do, and it was enabled... I do know that I never used it with anything or copied it out of the site.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:29:34
That's the million dollar question.
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:56:59
Looks like I had the API key enabled, but I've never used it for anything and kind of forgot about it. I suppose they may have guessed the key, but that doesn't seem plausible to me... (though I could be totally wrong about that)
