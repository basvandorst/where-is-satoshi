I wouldn't say that - there are examples where very sophisticated attacks could be traced. Symantec did it with stuxnet in 2010. Well at least they got a hold of a communication with the command and control servers. I'm just saying it's not completely impossible.

Everything comes at a price. You forget one thing tho. 
WU has one big cost factor, that outweighs all the other costs involved. Namely to maintain an infrastructure to transfer actual money. The model I described would be based on this new thing where you can store and transfer value, basically for free. You've probably heard about it, it's called Bitcoin.

this. While the Bitcoin community sat in the corner, weeping over being goxed the Dogecoin community did a tremendous job in marketing itself and thus cryptocurrencies as a whole.

A bank gives you a loan of say 10K (of money which they don't even have - they just increade a number in your account). Then you have to pay it back **plus** the interest. Now the bank actually has the original 10K **plus** the interest you paid.
interest creates money out of thin air and therefore is a flawed concept.

@_date: 2014-09-30 13:40:54
a high market cap will inevitably lead to higher prices. It can't work otherwise. It's just not possible.
just a simple and quite conservative math example:
PayPal has 152 million customers ([source]( Let's say 10% of those cutomers will use BTC in the future = 15 Million people worldwide.
Let's say every customer (BTC user) has only 2USD in BTC in their wallets = 30 Million USD.
If there are max 21 Million coins that means BTC has to be worth at least around 1.40USD if every single coin is mined and no coin was lost ever. (30 Million USD / 21 Million BTC)
This is a **very** conservative calculation.
* *If* Bitcoin gets mass-adopted there will be a lot more people using it then just 15 million people
* People will have by average more than just 2 USD in their wallets
* lots of coins are probably lost forever (HD failures etc)
* the last coin will be mined in 2140

Now all you need to do is found a company, get a really devout Muslim as a spokesman, advertise heavily in the Middle East and put up a remittance service that comes with your business model of storing wealth (include the fact that it can't be shut down by Israel or the U.S.).
Put up customized Robocoins in Arabic all over the Middle East and also advertise in countries where Muslims usually live outside Asia, like Europe and the U.S. 
You'll probably need a few million dollar to start and you should definitely have a cultural and law advisor from the countries you want to start in.

If you transfer a Website from one host to another and it doesnt arrive in the other host thats usually not a problem. Thats different with money, so thats not a very good comparison. There needs to ne some sort of regulation if you want to protect people from being goxxed in the future. Without regulation its only a matter of time till Goxx 2.0. people here see regulation as something bad for bitcoin, when its actually possible to protect users from fraud, if done right. Write your congress man a letter. Explain what kind of regulation you think bitcoin needs. Thats what will help bitcoin. Not libertarian fantasies about replacing fiat.

Be it simple things as the stupid windows EOL difference (LF+CR in opposition to LF) or the non existent support for tar or missing built in hashing algorithms, the terrible command line etc etc on windows...

Well, actually the question is, what do you think a global payment system is worth and what market cap it must have to work. 
Of course you have to make certain assumptions. But it's not about making perfect predictions but to get a feel for the order of magnitude (like a brain teaser where you have to tell a job interviewer how many golf balls would fit into a Smart)
This little to do with bitcoin itself. I'm not trying to evangelize - I'm  sceptic towards certain aspects myself (for example the cryptographic algorithms used in the long term). Sorry if I came across as trying to evangelize.

this will need time. German here, we had a money reform (DM to EUR) about 10 years ago. The first year or so, you calculate how the prices where in DM, but you get used to the new value over time. I say it can work. Also I kinda find this "Dogecoin is stupid" thing not expedient. When crypto currencies go down, they will *all* go down (and the government will probably come up with a badly done rip off "cryptocurrency" that is terribly flawed and will be an embarrassing fail)
But if cryptocurrencies will succeed (which I deeply believe), we will all succeed (at least like the first 5 currencies or so). So why the hostility? I find Dogecoin hilarious and I love it.

Don't know if you're serious or just trolling... Assuming you're serious: Erm, nope. In fact, the blockchain can be considered a distributed database, containing only a ledger.
The integrity and security comes from its architecture, full nodes and miners. WU has to maintain their infrastructure, including security with "classic" means of IT. They need to have extensive book keeping, data centers, admins, offices and actual stores in every country they serve. 
Do you really think a highly automated system like the one I proposed couldn't easily outperform *that*?
