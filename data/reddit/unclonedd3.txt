You can't take a loss on something if you bought it again 30 days before or after the sale. In that case, it's considered a wash sale and you have to hold off on claiming the loss until you sell the other BTC you bought in that period.

It's a like-item exchange just like trading Apple stock for Microsoft stock is a like-item exchange. Hint: no, it's not in any way a like-item exchange.

IRS: "No problem, buddy. You can take $3,000 loss per year. Enjoy!"

What is an example of "using Bitcoin to invest in the things that they usually use fiat for"?

For what it's worth, I am a tax accountant in public practice. I understand that those statements may  be confusing, but consider what it says:


Income tax is not the same as the gift tax, which is filed on a separate return. So while you will not owe any more or less income tax by making a gift over the annual exclusion, you still may have to file and pay the gift tax on another form.

The small volume of bitcoin means the global price can tank by half with just one truly wealthy person selling a little bit.

Who said you downside your house? You owned property in a place where the market heated up. You could upgrade to a nicer and larger pad elsewhere out of town and keep a chunk of change.

There is no tax on buying a pina colada in mexico with bitcoins. The tax is on realizing a capital gain. So it doesn't matter if it is stock, commodities, or bitcoins. If you realize a gain by getting more than your cost in an exchange, you generally have a capital gain. That's why the other example I gave is relevant, even if you didn't think that's what you were talking about.

It is in nobody's best interest for everyone to hold. If everyone holds, nobody realizes any gains and you might as well hold some rocks from your driveway. It's in everyone's interest for a currency to be used as a currency. As long as a majority of the holdings are speculative investments rather than any real-world use, bitcoin is highly subject to heavy losses.

Aside from any tax implications, bitcoins are definitely not a commodity by definition. Just look it up. It needs to have some actual real-world purpose. Bitcoins are a medium of exchange, so they are currency by definition.

Posts like this (OP) make me laugh. Some people think they are so damn smart because they bought a couple bitcoins. Why didn't you sell your clothes for more since you knew all along? You could have gotten 200 BTC for a pair of Levi's not too long ago.

Is success a high exchange rate between the US dollar or is success facilitated trades between users? It seems that bitcoin's advocates are more interested in making money off a bigger fool.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:06:01


This crash is evidence that bitcoin has not been adopted in a meaningful way and a huge majority of the holders are just speculators hoping for a bigger fool to come along. I hope for bitcoin or something similar to become a viable currency, but it definitely not currency primarily now.
We don't need some new fundamental shift to occur to crash it. The fundamental error is that the price was too high, so nothing new has to happen for the price to come back down.

If selling appreciated assets offshore made it tax-free then wouldn't everyone do that and never pay tax? Policy is mostly set for the more common scenarios, which doesn't include buying a pina colada in mexico with bitcoins. So of course some highly unusual transactions will have odd tax implications.
A US citizen's income can be taxable back home even if they move to another country for years or for life. The IRS does generally give credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, however.

Your loss is limited to your basis though. So if you bought at $10 and lost it at $1,000, you still only claim $10 of loss. If you want to claim you paid $100,000 for BTC that were later lost, you may be asked to prove it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:53:58


Not true at all. The market price is a quote of what you can expect to buy or sell one bitcoin for. If you 1,000 BTC when the price is $1,000, you could reasonably value it at $1million, but the fact is that you will lose 20%+ if you give a market order to sell it all at once.
Your BTC being worth X dollars does not mean X has been "paid in" either. Again, that's a market price. Only a relatively small volume of trading gives these market prices. A few trades at $1,000 does not mean $1,000 was given for every outstanding coin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:56:33


By that reasoning, nobody should be holding bitcoins as investments at all. All you are doing is hoping to profit from others. You can't have both. You want to buy bitcoins cheap, but then when things go bad, everyone should just hold theirs so you can get out unscathed. Pretty funny.

If I offered you $100,000 two years from now for one pair of jeans from your closet you wouldn't take the offer? You are either stupid or don't believe that I will pay. My point is that people who didn't pay didn't really "know" and they sure as hell aren't "experts" for buying two bitcoins.

Yes, that is the true causal relationship, but it is utter nonsense that has nothing to do with the real world. It would be nice if everyone just shared a bank account and there was plenty to go around, wouldn't it?

The IRS won't know. If you want to report it, it would be a similar outcome to selling it for cash state-side.


Buying goods with bitcoin does result in you realizing capital gains. If you paid $10 for a bitcoin and buy a TV with a fair market value of $500 on craigslist, you have a $490 capital gain.
I'm not getting into the employment issue without charging for my time researching that one!


The person who receives them will continue to carry your basis. If you bought 1 BTC for $10 and gift it, the donee will realize a gain or loss based on what they sell it for minus that same $10 basis you had. If you gift a large value, you may be required to file a [gift tax return](

You're the first person to use the word investment. And selling it on retirement to a place where prices haven't risen nearly as much works.

If someone pays $1000 for 1 bitcoin, it absolutely does not mean that every bitcoin in existence was bought for $1000. 
Of course the dollars don't disappear, but the willingness of anyone top give you the same dollars again can.

A commodity has an actual use. Bitcoin it's a currency, even though it isn't widely accepted.
