Banks absolutely can and will create a redeemable token for bitcoin.
It won't be worth as much.

In that case the bank would have to borrow money to cover it, or use another depositor's funds, or both. If there was a run on the bank they wouldn't be able to do that fast enough; collapse. But, runs are rare enough that they only have to keep 10% in reserves for people withdrawing.
Also note that the final borrowers have 8.1btc, but owe 8.1btc. 8.1 - 8.1 = 0. It's not extra money it's just with someone else temporarily. It's with new owners.
...what I mean to say is that it *could* work on the blockchain, because there isn't actually any btc being created; it's being "switcherood". Depositors would have to trust the banks, which goes against the entire fucking purpose [sigh], but there's nothing to stop people actually doing that.

Dude, that was Mt. Gox. That was "the end" of bitcoin. That was huge.
Are you telling me that there are a whole bunch of traders thinking it was a pattern, and they are making trades based on that?

Because in the crypto space bitcoin is too big to fail. The entire crypto market will come down with it. Sure, there'll still be cryptocurrency but it won't be going mainstream.

You've moved the goalposts from technology, to man-made technology, and now to brands.
Bitcoin is no more a brand that TCP or email. It's a protocol. Nobody owns it.

But we don't live in a world with multiple currencies. We all live in a locality that uses a local currency. If you're Jason fucking Bourne you might occasionally use three currencies.
The reason large regions like countries or unions use one currency is because it's a fucking pain in the ass to use more than one. Nobody decided to do this, *everybody* decided to do this.
Using multiple currencies for daily transactions is like going back to the barter system where we have to keep track of how many chickens for a goat, and how many goats for a sheep, and how many sheep for a haircut and so on and on and on. 
This is literally how money came about; a single unit of exchange to make life easier.

It's a very common misconception. It should be in there with flat earthers.




Look, you can trace the coins through the example you gave above. There are not 18.1, there are 10. Go count them.
Or run it through the same process without using a bank. Physical objects only.
Person A says to Person B "Can you look after this $10 for me?" He gives them 10x $1 coins. C asks B "Hey, can I borrow $5?". B replies "Well... I'm supposed to look after this for A, but they won't be needing it until the end of the week. Can you give it back by Thursday? With interest?". B gives C 5 coins.
There are *clearly* no more than 10 coins in circulation. And yet you are asking me to understand that A has 10, and B has 5 = 15. Somehow Person B has just "created money".
Alternately you can "uncreate money" too:

Look, I'm genuinely interested in iOTA because it is at least quite different to bitcoin, but...


Let's be honest, that doesn't happen very often, does it.


Not sure where you live but we've had all that for a decade, or more. With fiat. Australia is 99% cashless. [My shopping centre carpark reads number plates]( and charges (or not) automatically. Ditto all the toll roads.


Oh, I know. I work for one. Doing just that. But they're all in-house. Owned.


I have to totally agree with you here.

That's a great magic trick, but...
Bank 1 has 1btc.
Bank 2 has 0.9btc.
Borrowers have 8.1btc.
= 10btc
Notice that the first borrower there *does not have* their 9btc. It is on loan. Term deposit.
People can *owe* bitcoin just fine. It doesn't need to exist.

What if I need to borrow btc to buy a house? Or start a business? 
Is there anywhere that has a load of other people's btc just sitting in their accounts, doing nothing? ^CoinBase
Remember how banks worked before everything went digital? When everything was cash? Bitcoin is digital cash. There's no reason a bank couldn't use bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't *require* a bank, but it doesn't prevent a bank. And banks can be quite useful, if I need to borrow bitcoin to buy a house for example.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:43:19


You absolutely can and there are. The yen, the euro...
And often the US dollar has competed in countries where it is not even the local currency, beating out the weaker currency. Russia early 90s for example.
Ditto many other fiat currencies now and historically.




Yep, but I'd argue the competitors are weak. The market cap of them all combined is less than bitcoin. Bitcoin as a currency is far stronger than any or even all of them, which keeps it a far stronger currency, ad nauseum. The criticism you aim at bitcoin is far, far greater for the altcoins (combined)!
For a competitor to challenge bitcoin it can't be just better, it has to be *a lot* better to even begin to chip at bitcoins first mover advantage, network effect, and even stability. Bitcoin is the least volatile of the cryptocurrencies.


Look, *nobody* knows what will happen with bitcoin in the future, but that is a reasonable scenario.
I have my own opinion, and that is that while a stronger currency is entering the space and devouring value/wealth/whatever from all other currencies, and thereby going up in value very fast, *of course* nobody is going to be using it as a currency; they are all going to hodl (which creates even further scarcity).
On top of this it is still very early days. The beginning of the "early adopter" phase. Perhaps. There are a number of vendors accepting bitcoin, but let's face it fuck all (far less for the altcoins, even combined). It is pure speculation because what else couid it be?
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:52:03
Yeah. OK. That illustrates it pretty well actually. And Mt Gox was *before* that run. Really.  : \

@_date: 2017-10-03 05:27:49


This is, arguably, the point of "total saturation". The value of btc against, say, household goods is now stable. People will stop hoarding it and start using it, and only it.
Or, it goes up again. There have been years when it hasn't gone up.

Fractional Reserve would work with bitcoin. The thing with bitcoin is you don't *have to* use a bank, it's digital cash, but there's *nothing stopping* banks using bitcoin and people using bitcoin banks.
Seriously, just look at Coinbase.


Anything above 10%. It actually happens from time-to-time.


I completely understand you, but you're double counting some of the money; it can't *actually* be with two people at once; time division.


Bitcoin *can be* just numbers on a screen too. Again, just look at Coinbase and how it's being used by most account holders. Do they *really* have their bitcoin? Who knows?
If Coinbase notices that 80% of the funds never leave Coinbase they could come the the same conclusion any bank ever did; "Hey, we should make this bitcoin work for us and the owners of said bitcoin."
So, for an interest rate of 5% for leaving your coins on Coinbase, thus ensuring even more people will leave their coins on Coinbase, they can "safely" lend out, say 50% of total holdings at 7%, making a 2% haircut.
You see where this is going already, right? Blah-blah-blah; fractional reserves with bitcoin.
Now, being that bitcoin is what it is you can see that fractional reserve does not make money. Money actually comes from further up the chain by the way; it *is* made/invented; we agree on that. 
If I have my money in Coinbase earning interest then *I don't actually have it*. Whoever they've lent it to actually has it. I have an IOU for *n* btc, and ~~the bank~~ Coinbase has an IOU from the debtor.
It all balances to 0.
If you and I walk into a shop and I have $100, and you have $0, and there's something we want to buy for $190, I can't lend you $90 and then we can afford it.
What you're missing is that the money is split *across time*. It's the same amount of money in the economy, and the same coin is with different people at different times.
Fiat *is* just made up, but it's not by banks. (stay away from youtube)
