So if I buy some quadcopters, hook controllers with camera up to their control boards, and program the controllers to have the quadcopters wait outside your dwelling and attack you when you step outside, it's all right because they're autonomous?
Let's see, I predict that your first objection will be, "Those aren't autonomous, you programmed them to do that!"  And my response will be, "The hacker put code on the DAO blockchain which programmed the DAO to transfer funds.  You say that's ok, therefore so is what I did."
Anyway, your move, cupcake.  How do you escape my swarm of autonomous quadcopter death machines without violating the sanctity of their autonomy?

The way to convert BTC to GBTC is very simple:
1. Take your BTC to Coinbase
2. Go through Coinbase's ridiculous AML/KYC nonsense and wait for them to give you USD, assuming they don't just lock your coins up and tell you to fuck off
3. Withdraw your USD from Coinbase if they'll let you
4. Go to a brokerage company, such as Schwab or E*Trade or whatever
5. Open an account with the brokerage
6. Deposit your USD in the brokerage account
7. Put in a buy order for the ridiculously overpriced GBTC
8. Get your order filled
9. Sell your GBTC
tl;dr: BTC and GBTC are two different things and not directly convertible

Where are you getting that from?  His Wiki entry avoids politics, other than him moving to Canada to avoid the draft and to take a lot of drugs;  one interview has him stating that he tries to avoid politics in his books;  however, his books are nearly all class-segregated -- extremely wealthy corporatists vs. down-and-out street trash -- and generally show the corporatists in an extremely bad light as degenerates and vicious predators.  This fits far more with a left-wing worldview than a "libertarian utopian" worldview.

I don't see why.  TWTR has never made a profit and has no path to profitability.  Source: CNN
They have survived this long because they let everyone use their service for free, and their investors are willing to see money poured down the toilet in the name of some day making a profit.
But, as with most such fast-money startups, their numbers are mostly faked and their metrics are a joke.
Some media company might buy them and continue to operate them at a loss just for control over what people see, but that's a political/cultural propaganda war thing, not a business investment.

The Gatewood video is outdated.  The kiosk's prompts at Family Mart have changed;  they now ask for a password instead of a birth date.  Also, your phone must be a local number so that it can receive an SMS from the exchange.  Lastly, you cannot simply send the BTC you've purchased to some address;   the exchange requires you to enter an SMS verification code (sent to your phone) when using their wallet software (on their website) to send funds to other addresses.

You could dump half of it, in which case you'll have your money back and maybe some day be able to afford a car.  You wouldn't get the really hot bitches, but you could at least get a few chicks drunk enough to be able to get blowies in the alley behind the pub.  Maybe even two chicks at once.

Except that under an inflationary system, you have to consider that $100 in the hand today is worth more than $110 a few years down the line, because inflation erodes the value of money.  That $110 in an inflationary system only has the purchasing power of $95.  You just fool yourself into believing you made money (and the government helps you in fooling yourself by taxing away 40% of the difference, yay!).
You're pretending that the dollar value is static in an inflationary system.  It isn't.  If it were, the gold coins (aka "pet rocks" or "outmoded relics") my grandparents gave me wouldn't have gone up in value by 500% in the last twenty years.

Look, I'm not saying that the comparison between Bitcoin and TWTR is a valid one.  It obviously isn't.
But TWTR is just another dogshit "we'll make billions some day!" company, just like Oxygen.com, Pets.com, Excite.com, and thousands of other dot.com 1.0 companies -- the only difference is that Twitter came along when "Web 2.0 -- this time it's social!" was a meme.  Well, those are going to crash and burn too.  Not too far off IMHO, considering the "we're in a recession now!" flashing warning lights going off.
Outfits like Facebook and Google, on the other hand, have figured out how to monetize their users through data mining and advertising.  As much as I hate Facebook, they will probably survive.  Twitter?  Reddit?  Probably not so much.

But then how do you deal with trainwrecks like EBay, where buyers routinely ship empty boxes back to sellers when claiming "merchandise not as advertised" or "was broken on arrival"?
How do you deal with "Licensee shall use its best reasonable efforts to market Product within Territory"?
These things end up being judgment calls that, in real contracts, are decided by going to trial before a judge and jury -- or by binding arbitration before a panel of experienced commercial arbiters -- where a bunch of humans try to decide whether the Licensee really did use "best reasonable efforts" such as advertising, promotions, putting merchandise in visible places in stores, and so on to market the Product.  Or where some EBay customer support drone in India simply marks off a checkbox (labeled in Hindi) saying (loose translation) "seller bitched, who the fuck cares, we sure don't, fuck him over in favor of the buyer".

I'm browsing on a Pi 2, and it is frustratingly slow, runs out of memory quickly, and the browser crashes whenever someone posts a huge image (e.g., Earthporn).
Pi 3 is only 50% faster, which would still suck, and the amount of heat it throws off is enough to boil water for making tea.  The CPU exceeds 100C in minutes even without stressing the CPU.  In a constrained space with poor ventilation, like a laptop, this tends to melt the plastic parts.
Sure, you could build an ARM laptop.  Most users won't put up with such a crappy experience.

Ask yourself where all of this information was stored.  My guess is that whichever computer it is on has been backdoored, and your hacker has scanned through every email, webpage, your porn collection, diary, and bank account information.
Contact all of your institutions -- credit cards, banks, everything -- and make sure your accounts are all locked down.
Get a Raspberry Pi and keep it offline.  Generate your keys on that.  Transfer bitcoin to the clean addresses.
