BTW, at the ATM you can buy / sell Bitcoin, E T H, L T C, and some lying shitcoin I've never heard of called Bcash.
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:24:29
I'll stick with my BT thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:09:45
Any other impossible questions you would like to ask?  Such as, why are we here?   Why Batwoman?  What happened to Star Wars?

They may be downvoting because they suspect a shill ...
@_date: 2019-12-25 12:07:43
Yeah, I know the difference, and have a few dozen X M R.  I'm not a noob.
Merry Xmas
@_date: 2019-12-24 13:16:10
I love your creativity with spelling.
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:40:53
Er.  My brain hurts now.

I'm not up with the new Ledgers - but what I generally do - with anything from a nuclear power core to a washing machine - is follow the advice given by the manufacturer.
Yeh, I know: I'm such a bore.

Good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-26 12:24:05
So when did you sell all your crypto :)
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:16:57
Thx for completing that for me.
My cleaners/assistants: Brie Larson and Batwoman would normally approve; but suspect you may be mansplaining.

Ref: 2.
How would you know which phone network provider the target was using?  
Who would you contact within that company, and how would you approach them with your offer?
Assuming that this employee is dishonest - which is a big if - do you think they would commit a serious crime for you for 100 bucks?
Would she/he have access to individual's details?  Would he/she know how to change them?  Or even know how to 'port'?
I recommend you build yourself a concrete bunker, stock up with water and canned food, disconnect from the internet, and stay in there.

Why would something meaningless like your post, and empty of any thought or consideration, be fun?
@_date: 2019-12-31 08:39:28
Got it.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:41:30
Or maybe just flag down a passing UAP and get an alien to do all this stuff for you?
You're right - the possibilities are endless.
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:08:22
Crikey.  That was a bit earnest.  Heh :)
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:05:23
Really?  My wife tells me to get on with another job while I'm waiting.
@_date: 2019-12-24 13:15:36
I am triggered by your sexist comment.  I will enrol at a university to find a safe space and calm down.
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:12:46
Chrap.  I'll be dead in 50 years.  :)

0.32 BTC is worth over 2000 USD - I suggest you proceed with great caution Grasshopper.
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:26:18
Every single time I have traded a small percentage of my BTC for alts, I have regretted it.  Thank God I never traded more than 5%.  It is simply not worth it.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:04:35
Ho ho!  What a chancer.
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:38:38
Downvote the comment telling us not to upvote the daily!  er ..
@_date: 2019-12-26 11:13:36
Back where it ought to be and deserves to be: like before all these lying shitcoins appeared.  People have finally learnt though.
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:21:47


Hang on, that's over 4 dollars, unless the aliens have been fucking with my calculator again.
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:40:31
I'm looking for BcashBtrash. 
Where's he gone?
Legendary in non-legendary circles here in New England.

If you look at Bitcoin's performance over the past month, it is crapping and dumping on the rest.  
I love to see RogerCoin being teabagged, but it is with some regret that I personally own a small proportion of other coins - they are failing.
Ho ho!  Never mind!
Good for Bitcoin.
I see great things ahead.
(PC approved: Brie and Batwoman endorse this post.)
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:21:34
Don't forget the demand for RogerCoin - i.e. lying Bcash - from confused people who think it is Bitcoin.  
Nice work Rog., but even you have to admit that the lying is gradually failing.  
Give up Sir!  (and when I write sir, I don't mean it.)
@_date: 2019-12-27 23:12:00
That is why real Bitcoin has so much value.
So sorry Roger ...

Easter eggs arrived in my local store today.  I know, because they were laughing about it.
@_date: 2019-12-27 21:50:49
X M R is underpriced.

I don't even get a touché from her unless I decorate all day.
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:30:18
There's a tiny 24 hour store near me in my large city.  
They never close, even open today (hoorah!)
They've had a Bitcoin ATM installed!  This is not an upmarket part of town, and a pretty run down shop.  But here's a state of the art ATM.
I'll get a photo next time I'm in.

Something to do with religion.  I wish people would leave religion out of Xmas and Easter.  I don't know when that nonsense started.  Hip hip!
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:56:59
If that made sense, I would reply, so I won't.
@_date: 2019-12-26 11:41:12
Based on no evidence whatsoever, I'm inclined to completely agree with you.  It will be a blinding year.
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:56:40
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:35:10
I think he meant where do you sell your Bcash to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-24 13:41:22
Hi mate.  It's me.  Polar bear collection is looking good.  They call it an aurora you know.
