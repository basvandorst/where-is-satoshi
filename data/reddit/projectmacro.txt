Regulation? Bitcoin would be dead for me if that happened.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:54:14
Most people are quite barbaric these days. =(
Why can't we be gentler?
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:35:04
This. A thousand times.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:39:52
Let's agree to disagree, Bear. This clearly isn't going anywhere. 
See ya!
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:48:07
People agreeing or not with me is not the problem. If someone is a christian, and doesn't like homosexuals, I don't have a problem with that. They're free to do as they please.
However, if they try to attack homosexuals legally, that's a problem. I may not agree with religion, but I would never, ever, pass a law to make their beliefs illegal. Freedom comes first, for everyone, not only for those who I agree with.
Yes... If one is against stoning of women in the Middle East, the most intelligent thing is to move to a more decent country. It's irrational to wait for your society to change. They probably won't, at least in your lifetime. 
But that still isn't just. The evil ones should be the ones to be punished, not the good ones. In the same way, gay people shouldn't have to leave India just because religious groups decided to make their views obligatory for everyone else. That's called oppression.


Is that the kind of person you are? Well, that's really a shame, buddy... I don't feel like continuing this conversation any longer. =/
I hope you're a troll. You can't be that evil haha. See ya!
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:50:22
If he was the only one involved, I'd like to think that he would've done just as you said.
But there were thousands of people, regular people, just users of the website, the vast majority of them good people, who would get harassed badly if he decided to spearhead the cause. He couldn't make this decision without considering their lives as well.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:59:33
Where can I find more people who think like you do? It's quite lonely to have no one to talk to about stuff like that.
Libertarians? Anarcho-capitalists? o/
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:11:58
Homosexuality is now illegal in India. Would you tell gay people there the same thing?
"I agree that people should go to bed with whoever they want... As long as they're willing to pay the price of being arrested and jailed. Whether you believe this particular law is 'immoral' or 'unjust' is beside the point. Point being, breaking the law is illegal, and therefore punishable by arrest, fines, and/or prison.
That sounds quite horrible, man... =/
Stupid laws should be broken. That's the rational and human thing to do, I believe... There are women being stoned to death in the Middle East now thanks to some 'Law'. Would you say to these women they're being treated fairly...?
Morals come first. The Law must be in accordance with them. That's what I think, at least... &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:29:26
Take me out of that "we". Chalie Shrem is apparently a good guy... I don't give a damn if he has making it easier for people to buy drugs online. They should be free to do so anyway! It makes the streets safer for everyone, also.
I suppose he's got libertarian or anarcho-capitalism leanings. I don't really have a problem with that at all. It's more people like him what we actually need these days.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:00:38
If this guy threatened him and the Silk Road users, then yes, it was his fault and murder was the only solution for this particular case.
Ross was only doing what was more rational, again, in this particular case.
He had only two choices:
1) Let the blackmailer ruin thousands of lives, and send innocent people who were trading goods in peace to rape cages;
2) Kill him in order to protect everyone.
In a civilized world, he would just sue this guy. But thanks to the government, he wouldn't be able to do so. Violence was the only option.
Do no mistake who the real enemy is. Drug Black Markets my be illegal, but they're not immoral. People should be free to do whatever they want with their own bodies.
Nothing is wrong with me. I'm just trying to look at the situation through a different angle... 
Most people are too simple-minded. Yes, he tried to kill a guy. He had to do it in order to save tons of people, and this was his only option since the government made it impossible for him to sue the blackmailer... Murder was his only resort in this situation.
"But... But... He tried to get someone killed!"
Don't the circumstances that led him to make this decision matter...? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:19:21
I can't believe people here are down-voting you. What the hell is wrong with you guys? I thought most here were libertarians. =/

Let's agree to disagree then. This isn't going anywhere, bear.
See ya, dude.

In the full transcript.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:07:46
Please tell me if this is a valid comparison:
Gay people are constantly jailed and hanged in places where homosexuality is illegal. Are they 'criminals' regardless of what I think?
Little girls can't even build lemonade stands in front of their homes now in some US cities. Is it right? "It's the Law, obey it."?
If the Law is wrong, we must fight it. If we accept that we are criminals, they win.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:14:56
namdlev, you've got nothing to worry about! These are relevant:
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:40:33
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:57:25
Why can't people understand this? Why can't I find humans who follow that line of reasoning?
It's depressing to see people here on the Bitcoin subreddit being so mindless. I thought the purpose of the coin was fighting for Freedom. =/
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:41:33
Yes, we still don't need regulation.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:16:40
No, you are wrong. It's not a stupid accusation.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:51:19
I thought Bitcoin's biggest selling point was that it was a great tool for people to fight for their freedoms. Even Satoshi Nakamoto himself had libertarian leanings, right? 
People should be free to buy drugs. It's even better when they buy their stuff online! This only makes the streets safer for everyone.
The people on the Bitcoin Foundation, and most libertarians, would rather give up on Bitcoin than support heavy regulation, even if that somehow made the price soar. If people are in it just because of the profit, no matter the means, Bitcoin probably won't last long.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:01:02
Making a difference is not my purpose. I just like to think about stuff like that.
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:29:50
I guess the point is fighting for what's just, under a libertarian morality. 
If fighting for Liberty is illegal, then let's break the law. There's a town around here where is was illegal for people to sell red meat on sundays... Then, the People created a black market for red meat. xD
I only support laws that were proved to be rationally true and necessary. = )

@_date: 2014-09-09 03:30:33
Hello, guys!
Can someone help me out here? I just searched for blockchain on Google, and the very first result seems quite suspicious to me with that double 'i'.
Is this the real deal? If it's not, why would it appear as a Google Ad? Could my PC be infected or something? =/
I just opened it, and it does look quite broken. Some images are missing, and some of the links don't do anything...
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:55:26
Evil people, that's why... =/
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:24:16
Yes, going to jail was a possibility. An unfortunate one, of course, since his service should not be considered illegal in the first place.
If these "other people" were the ones who initiated the aggression on what they knew was a situation devoid of any sort of possible legal action, then yes, murder, unfortunately, becomes a valid possibility. If they didn't initiate any sort of aggression, however, there's no rational reason for killing them.
He wasn't wrong to attempt to kill someone under these particular circumstances. Morality isn't absolute, values are contextual. They dependend on the context of a given situation.
Again, I don't think it's important to take note of the security level of the website. I'm not sure if this is a valid comparison but here it goes: my house has no security system whatsoever. If someone breaks in and robs me, does it matter how protected I was? The important part is that I was robbed, right?
Why would he need to suffer? He was leading the website in peace, all was good, until someone came and threatened to expose everyone. This is the one person who should be punished, and the punishment was murder, unfortunately, as lawyers couldn't help in this situation.
To go from a drug dealer to a murderer is a step down? Most drug dealers would rather solve their differences though the Justice System instead of risking their lives through violence... They're not the ones at fault here, it's the government.
Silk Road was a noble idea, considering how perverse and immoral this failed War on Drugs is. He's a hero, in a sense.
See ya dude! I got a lot to think about this. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:16:33
You are right. There's absolutely no excuse for him not hiring better professionals. If he knew they wouldn't be able to get the job done, he should've done that ages ago.
I'm not sure if what they did was criminal though. If these problems are just the result of incompetence, should we involve the government with this? I really can't see any legal punishment being necessary in this case. 
There was no guarantee for the users that we would get our coins back in case they got lost thanks to incompetence. If he did provide such 'insurance' for us, then yes, legal action would be proper. 
...Or maybe one of my premises is flawed. I still need to think more about this.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:55:26
I suppose you're right. 
We must make sure our 'illicit' associations are better hidden, then. Away from important public personalities.
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:11:10
Excuse me, what...?
How did you arrive at that conclusion? Where did I say anything like that?
God, this is hard.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:00:07


That's the root of the problem. The individual comes first, not the collective.
If the majority votes and wins on an issue, it doesn't make the issue right. What determines if the issue is right or not, is rationality.
Gay people in India are the victims. They shouldn't need to leave their country or families. The true villains is their society, for allowing such law to pass.
If we disagree on that, there's no point in continuing this conversation. I'm a libertarian. o/
On which side are you on? = )
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:17:51
It will only get worse from now on. -_-
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:13:36
It's a shame most people won't really understand that. Your comment couldn't be any more rational! = )
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:03:57
It's not disrespectful. Peaceful drug dealers and homosexuals are both groups of good people.
You're the one being disrespectful to drug users. Let them be.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:50:01
I don't think raping justly-jailed people is ever justified, also. Even if the person is a child molester or something.
Sorry if what I wrote wasn't clear enough. 
And thanks for pointing that out to me. = )
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:51:07
Those who deal with drugs would rather do business in a peaceful manner, in general. The government won't allow them to do so, unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:01:35
You are absolutely right.
I lost a bit more of my faith in humanity when I saw how many upvotes that guy got... 
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:56:45
Maybe I should rephrase that.
Yes, he's being 'justly' jailed for breaking the law.
However, the law he broke isn't rational or moral, as people should be free to use whatever drugs they want. It's not just to be jailed for something like that.
It's like, being jailed for being gay in India, now that homosexuality is illegal. Would you call these people criminals? Would you say they are being 'justly jailed', because that's what the Law says?
Irrational and immoral laws should be fought. Unfortunately, most people will just hear that he's a 'criminal' and stop there. They are too quick to judge. A guy with no criminal records up until now, part of the Bitcoin Foundation, a guy who's on the same team as us and should be getting support... But then people see him being called a 'criminal', just for engaging in some sort of victimless crime, and they quickly turn their backs. That's what the government wants.
If they make Bitcoin illegal, we should stand up for each other. The general public will just call us 'criminals' for still using Bitcoin, but we'll know we are the true victims in the process.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:44:13
I'm just saying that morality is different from something being legal or not.
Being gay is not immoral. If the Law makes homosexuality illegal, it still doesn't make it immoral.
In the same way:
Using-Buying-Selling drugs is not immoral. If the Law makes it illegal, it still doesn't make it immoral.
@_date: 2014-04-22 04:46:55
Yes, also harmless. People should be free to do whatever the hell they want with their own bodies.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:12:50
Apparently he's not the evil guy everyone was painting him. He really doesn't look like the kind of guy who would steal millions of dollars...
He was making money honestly, after all. He's just incompetent.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:57:31
Do you consider the people who were selling/buying drugs at Silk Road criminals?
I don't. And this makes a whole lot of difference to me, Antartic.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:26:23
I'm not blaming the victims.
If a woman gets raped by walking in a dangerous place at night with provocative clothing, she's still the victim. However, any police officer would agree that she was extremely naive/stupid, at least.
There were dozens of reasons for not using MtGox. We've been saying that for ages... Yes, I feel bad so many people got screwed, but they could've avoided it by not having so much money online or by using BitStamp. BS is available in Australia, I suppose?
Again, not blaming the users. I just think you were naive. 
If Gox manages to get out of this hole, if they recover the coins somehow, please never do business with them again. That's all.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:09:47
People should take responsibility for their actions. Why not use Bitstamp or another exchange?
MtGox started in a neighborhood card shop, for Christ's sake. Of course they weren't ready to run an international business of this kind. 
Those who want him dead just don't want to take the blame for being stupid with their choice of exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:24:16
How did I miss that. Thanks for the links, Jrmrjnck!
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:57:48
He looks kinda depressed to me...
I would too, if my small business grew way too fast and I didn't have the competence to run it responsibly on an international scale. 
If he knew he wasn't able to get the job done though, he should've hired better professionals ages ago, in respect for his customers.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:16:28
His business started from a neighborhood card shop. They weren't ready to run an international business of this kind.
I feel kinda bad for the guy, actually. If someone murders him, that's because they don't want to take the blame for being stupid with their own choice of exchange.
Those who lost millions should take responsibility for their actions. Having that much money online, really?
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:03:37
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:34:12
I'm trying to see this whole situation under a different light. 
It bothers me how people just hear "Ross tried to get someone killed" and then quickly make up their minds about the situation. I think it's important to learn of the circumstances that led him to make that decision...
If I killed a guy, does this mean I'm in the wrong?
There's not enough information... What if I killed a serial killer? Or the guy who tried to rape my wife? Or the blackmailer who was threatening to send me and the thousands of people at Silk Road to rape cages?
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:23:22
I was naive, I guess. There aren't that many libertarians around anyway... =(
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:37:01
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:52:15
No, nothing. As I said, this isn't going anywhere.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:23:20
I can't stand scum like you. What if it were you there instead of him? Being unjustly jailed?
I don't give a damn if people are buying drugs online. They should be free to do so. This makes the streets safer for everyone, also.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:20:11
Maybe I will, someday. Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-01-28 05:23:26
Sad and true. =/
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:03:10
He tried to have someone murdered in order to protect the thousands of SilkRoad users (and their families) who were depending on him.
The one who initiated the aggression was the blackmailer. He threatened to send Ross and everyone else on the website to rape cages.
What would you do in that kind of situation? Thanks to the government, he wouldn't be able to sue the guy. Violence is the only option when the government makes stuff illegal, unfortunately. =/
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:01:40
I missed ya, To The Moon Guy! Go Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:18:25
Sarcasm? xD
I should've posted the link haha.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:57:23
I suppose he was out of options.
I mean, when you're running a service which is considered illegal by the government, and some guy blackmails you and your thousands of clients, what can you reasonably do?
He wasn't able to sue the guy legally. In these cases violence is the only option, right? The one who initiated the aggression was the blackmailer, of course, as he was threatening to send Ross and thousands of people to rape cages.
That's a hard decision to make, by I would've done the same thing. If I had all the people using my website depending on me (and their families), would I just let some guy go and destroy their lives? For just trading some products which should not even be illegal in the first place?
The government is the one at fault here. By making drugs illegal, violence tends to be the only option to solve conflicts, instead of lawyers. =/
That's what I think so far, anyway...
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:46:17
It makes me a bit sad to know that. 
I wonder if these people would support heavy Bitcoin regulations by the governments in case that could, somehow, make the price soar. 
Bitcoin's decentralized nature is actually the biggest selling point to me. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:18:08
Well, that makes sense. In nature, if a population of animals grows fast and there isn't enough resources for everyone, they will engage in violence and start killing each other for food/sexual partners. Disease spreads, all sorts of problems... 
Many will die, and then the population will get stable again.
In places with some sort of birth control, violence decreases because of that. Why do parents have a kid if they KNOW they aren't able to provide this kid with a dignified childhood? That's absurd! No kid deserves that. 
First, you fight for your place in the world, get a job (bad or good), start saving money... And then, if you're sure that your kid won't starve, have one if needed. It's that simple. It also doesn't make sense to steal from the responsible parents, through taxes, to give our money to these irresponsible ones. =/
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:46:26
Fine. It's not harmless.
In the same way, I wouldn't say that eating fast food is harmless. People should be free to eat whatever they want though.
Liberty comes first.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:28:16
Drug dealers and buyers are as criminal as gay people are in Uganda.
So, not criminal at all.
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:38:46
Yes, murder can be acceptable sometimes. 
Like, killing a guy in order to save the life of a family member. Or, in Ross' case, killing a blackmailer in order to save the lives of thousands of people.
If it were just to "cover his ass'', then yes, I would say you're right. 
He had tons of people, great people, who would be harassed by the government like real criminals if the blackmailer succeed though. 
What would you do in such a situation?
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:33:31
To me it's quite simple:
If this guy threatened to expose him and the users, then killing him would be the only option. If there were no threats, then killing the guy would be absolutely wrong!
Does it really matter that he made tons of mistakes? I mean, if his service was a lot better protected, and he still got exploited, would that make a difference?
The 'exploiter' is the one in the wrong, no matter how well protected his victim was.
Does it matter that it was was actually a setup? He only made the decision of hiring a killer because he thought the threats were very real.
I suppose, yes. If you start something like that, you gotta have balls. I wouldn't say it in the way you put it though. Like, if you are gay in Uganda, should you ''be prepared for jail or suicide?'' If a gay person goes to jail there, I feel really bad. I don't think "If you're gay in Uganda, then you should be willing to suffer the punishment.'' No! The punishment is immoral, come on! Fuck the government!
Or something like that. My mind is a mess. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:55:17
Not much.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:08:10
Wise decision, really. That would be way too risky. xD
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:16:47
