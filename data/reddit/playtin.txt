The big negatives are all those scam sites. Just look at the recent coinbet scam ( Those operators clearly just try to pull off a get rich quick scheme, since they don't even own any bankroll to cover a winning player. The question is how should a player distinguish a honest site from a scam site.
But I agree with Stunna, all those things that we in the Bitcoin world take for granted, like instant deposits and withdrawals, provably fair and so on are completely unheard of in the fiat gambling world and a huge competitive advantage.

Actually this is off-topic, but anyway: After running a profitable business for more than a year, a lot of our friends and even others where constantly asking to participate. So eventually we added a scale-up method without anybody losing the current steady profit stream. This is why we are selling bankroll shares instead of company shares. And we added big hurdles to prevent too much investments to ensure that we can grow the revenue along with the investments.

Since more than a year we have a login-with-your-bitcoin-wallet feature at our site. Sadly it is not used that much.
A more comfortable process like the one described in this paper could hopefully improve adoption of this.

What a huge waste of time and money. Really sad.

Buying more BTC is always a good strategy

No need to regret anything, just buy now. Bitcoin is still at its infancy

Yes, no fees :-)

Care to explain why and about what?
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:16:10
Do you mean this one?
It is from here:

Sorry for the late reply.
Any combination of 12 numbers has the same probability as every other combination of 12 numbers. Even a sequence of 12 times a '0' has the same probability. I know this is not what our human intuition tells us, but that is a mathematical fact.
Provably fair mean you can prove it yourself. Just click the ✔ button and the verify dialog will be visible. There is a link in there revealing the whole process. You can even put your own text into the "client secret" field which will be used for the next play.

They don't take Bitcoin for payment

We are doing both, automatic mixing of deposits/withdrawals and off chain transactions.
It is possible to send funds (currently Bitcoin and Litecoin) from one account to another account using anonymous unique account IDs.
The Bitcoin/Litecoin address is only used for deposits. Withdrawals can come from any address. You can't play SD from our wallet, fortunately we have a few better replacements ;-)

SecondLife destroyed itself. L$ is a centralized concept, absolutly no difference to PayPal$. And then one day LindenLabs decided that they no longer want gambling on their site and thus the end of SL begun. SL has become an excellent example how centralized dictatorship will destroy freedom and the economy. Full disclosure: we run a Bitcoin casino and so we are maybe a tiny little bit biased

Getting free BTC for writing a bot and posting it is definitely +EV ;-)

We have already donated to CoinJoin ;-) Hopefully it will be implemented soon.
Well, there is no need for us to steal your coins. We have a very well working business model and the wallet is basically a byproduct.

It looks that they sent a prototype to a developer - or did I get this wrong?

Theymos will double your donation:

I mentioned 12 because you wrote about 10+2 rolls. Of course every number has always the same probability - every roll is completely independent from all the others. For each single play the server generates a server secret (which cannot be changes since we tell you hash), and the user specifies a client secret (a random one will be generated if you dont specify your own). Both secrets together are used to shuffle the numbers. The final number is the top number of the stack. The actual shuffling is a result of the the server secret and the client secret. The server does not know what the client secret will be, it does not know what your bets will be, and the server secret can no longer be changed - cheating is impossible.

Just don't let a bad day get you down. There is a reason why it is called gambling. One day you lose, next day you win!

We use this on our  site. It is used only by a small minority, so it seems that this is too much hassle for the average user.

I see. So BFL is now in the ASIC prototype hosting business? :)

I guess you are right. Look at this link
 - It is Bruce Wagners site
