Oops I was confused with Ethereum classic (ETC). Thank you kind sir.

There you go:  
It is an airdropped crypto, trading at Poloniex and other sites.

No joke there. So far we had Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and recently the snapshot for Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) was taken. I am not sure whether the latter is already actively trading, or only BCD futures.
Also, each BTC (and LTC and DOGE) owner was gifted CLAM in 2014.

Belgium, I suppose?

For most 'regular people' there is no clear advantage for using BTC for these small transactions.
I have been waiting for bigger blocks or other scaling solutions for over 2 years. There is only so much patience one can have.

It indeed does not mean allot. Interest might be higher than before, but do not base your trading on this. It is far from being actually approved, and living up to it's hype.
I would be more interested in seeing the results for:
'Short bitcoin ETF' versus 'Buy bitcoin ETF'
in a few weeks time.

I agree. When you read his earliest posts this becomes quite clear. He bootstrapped the network, and probably deliberately restricted his own access to these early mined bitcoin. 
Maybe a way to protect himself against human greed? Remove the temptation to do something stupid? We might never know for sure.

Indeed. People made fun of him for buying those 'overpriced' coins. To be honest, at that time it was a really bad deal considering the ensuing bear market.  I hope he held on to them though!

Indeed, the light client only takes up about 300 MB and is fully synced within 10 minutes! :) 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:18:44
About 5-10 minutes with the light client ;)

Bitcoin: about 300.000 transactions a day
Ethereum: about 150.000 transactions a day, or about where BTC was one year ago.
Rootstock is just wishful thinking for the moment, no? I was not impressed by their presentation at consensus. 
And inflation will be drastically reduced when switching to PoS.

Anyone has another source for this? Cannot find this online.

You mean like ERC20 tokens in Ethereum?
