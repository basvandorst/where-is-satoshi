Hey there from the second I heard about Microsoft accepting Bitcoin I was so excited about this news that I bought 3 games and 12 month xbl gold with Bitcoin to encourage others to use Bitcoin as well. :)

So because your AV says 0 threat it means your PC is secure? Most virus are not detectable by AVs or Firewalls, I could say that pretty my much over 99% of virus/malware are NOT detectable by Anti Virus. I don't have an anti virus myself, I check my PC manually because that way I can find those Virus that anti virus cant. Also your e-mail could be compromise, 2FA does NOT mean you are secure at all, it just means you have 2 layer of protection rather than one.

I am in Italy, sorry did not mean state as country, but I meant that I am not very wealthy to afford it :(

You are very generous person man, I agree with what you are doing. I wish I had bitcoins to tip people with but unfortunately my current state does not let me :(

Thats something you really dont need to know.

No sorry, this thread is not meant for that.
This thread is meant for people to tell if they have received any money back from Cavirtex.
