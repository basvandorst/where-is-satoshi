No, locked means you can't send Bitcoins (it will ask you for the password to unlock), but see incoming transactions.
I'm afraid you sent it to the wrong address... Could you maybe show a screenshot of your Bitcoin-Qt where it displays the address you sent the coins to (you can black out the address for privacy, I just want to make sure it's an address that belongs to your wallet)?

Looking at Localbitcoins I would say there is definitely demand at 5% if the transaction is quick, secure and anonymous.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:42:51
Nope, all properly coded clients should be able to detect double spends, so that the second (or third etc) attempt will fail.
There is only one way to do a successful double spend
- Create transaction A that sends 1 Bitcoin to an address owned by you and start mining to create a block containing this transaction, but don't send it out to the network
- Create double spend transaction B paying Starbucks and send it out to the network
- Release your block as fast as possible
The only problem is, you can not predict when the block will be found, so you'd essentially have to wait for a message from your mining rig at Starbucks and then jump up to do the transaction. It might still fail if somebody else finds a block in the meantime.
If you consider the block reward of $20k currently, the coffee is not worth the effort.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:12:45
Well you should be able to safely remove some packages (you might have things like OpenOffice installed) and you could do optimizations such as reducing the disk space reserved for the root user in you file system.
However the more long-term solution is probably to migrate. 
On the other hand especially if you are in a well-covered area maybe it's not even neccessary to run so many nodes. Mine is not heavily loaded here in Germany...
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:10:24
If your client is secure, using a public wireless should not be too much of a problem, since you can get VPN services for Bitcoins or even connect to your home network via VPN.

Strange indeed, never saw this error before.

Well, how does this put Localbitcoins in trouble? Every user has to respect their local laws of course.
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:11:49
I'd always use both methods and split the funds.
While both blockchain.info and a paper wallet appear to be pretty safe, something can happen in both cases, but still you'd lose only half of your money instead of all.
Depending on the amount you have I'd probably create several paper wallets and store a little locally and maybe on on an exchange like Coinbase considering you might want to put some of your coins to use.
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:32:15
Ok, no need to worry then, the money is still in your multibit wallet. Just reset the blockchain, your balance should then be accurate and you can send it again if you want.

@_date: 2014-04-24 09:22:38
While I accept your opinion your arguments seem to indicate you don't understand some key points here.
1) The bus card example is very misleading, because it can only be used for one single purpose - using buses. Did you ever see anyone trade a bus card for food or some other item of value? That's what makes a currency.
2) Since all coins I know can be split into tiny fractions it does not matter how much "one coin" is worth. You can run around with a Dogecoin wallet worth $20 as well as a Bitcoin wallet worth the same amount. 
3) In the short-term spending a currency makes its value drop as opposed to hoarding it as a commodity (as long as this does not trigger a higher monetary supply as in paper currencies).
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:06:13
Should be perfectly enough. It will even go down: 
Check your transaction on blockchain.info, it shows an estimate how long it will need to confirm.

1) Yes, most reliable providers are Bitpay and Coinbase
2) There are many secure and easy ways, either you accept Bitcoin directly or you integrate Bitpay or Coinbase and can choose whether you want to keep Bitcoin or USD.
3) Either you have the prices in fiat and adjust the BTC price constantly by using an API e.g. the Bitpay API or you adjust your BTC prices daily and take a certain risk if BTC rates change.

Yeah, unconfirmed reward should be (almost) real time on Slush's pool. It takes 100 confirmations (less than a day) to fully confirm.
You have to consider though that the pool only does payouts of at least 0.01 Bitcoins, so you'll never get anything this way.
Edit: I highly doubt you will *ever* reach the 0.01 payout treshold with 11 MHash/s.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:32:04
Right. It does not really matter to Bitcoin as a currency though apart from driving prices up because it becomes more scarce.
Since Bitcoin is divisible even 1 BTC would be enough for the world economy, you would just have very small numbers (like you'd be rich owning 0.0001 BTC)

If you mean the newly minted coins for every block, this is still public. Just click on any block listed on blockchain.info and have a look at the first transaction - that's the address the newly minted coins go to.
I suppose that's what you call "starting point" for a coin right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:23:42
That was not my intention, sorry if it sounds this way. Considering the title I just thought I'd share, since I'm really happy with it (even though I know it has limitations).

I am seeing trouble and I would not advise anyone to invest all money into stocks/bonds but it's a matter of risk and reward.
If the financial system crashes again (would not be the first time) Bitcoin might go up, but owning Bitcoin is still extremely risky. The market is still small and even if crypto succeeds it might not be Bitcoin.

That's strange then. However keep in mind that the algorithm Blockchain uses to determine the priority is not the same, that miners use!
I've seen several "high priority" transactions on Blockchain that had little fees and very little amounts of BTC transferred, causing miners to not treat them with high priority.

According to Bitcoinity the highest trades on Kraken were for 506 € on March 4th. That means your trailing stop loss should have been set to 506 - 10% = 455 €. 
It's not absolutely accurate, but I don't see this not working in general.
I'd assume Kraken does not take the absolutely highest point if there was not enough volume at that point. Maybe they also take some sort of average (maybe like a 1 hour average or so) to adjust the trailing stop loss.
Edit: TL;DR: For me it seems to have worked as expected.

There is the "official" Bitcoin client from the core developers over at Bitcoin.org, but also most other clients are open source. Because the protocol is just rules defined in the client(s) I would consider it to be open source as well.
About Bitcoin addresses there is just the convention that they have to have a certain length and start with 1 (multi signature addresses start with 3 as an exception).
There is an algorithm defined to calculate private keys and derive the public key. Nobody checks it, so it's theoretically possible to generate an address, that is already being used (even though that chance is astronomically small).
Hope everything is correct and it helps :)

Well the transaction is created by the script in your browser, if there is a connection problem it might not be transmitted to the network.

Depends where you are going, just do a little research before.
E.g. Istanbul apparently has an ATM that changes your leftover money to Bitcoin when you leave the county. Buenos Aires offers a lot of different things that accept Bitcoin.
I think [Coinmap]( would be a good start :)
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:01:09
Well it's .7EUR/mbtc on *gox*, the exchanges that give you the euros immediately (like Kraken) are &lt;.6EUR/mbtc right now, so there is only a little premium that Bitpay takes.
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:53:56
Be careful please, mining comes with different risks than just owning Bitcoins.
In my opinion it is impossible to calculate a break even on mining contracts, because you never know how reliable/honest your provider is and how the difficulty develops.
Just imagine the price rises by another 5-10x like last year - mining capacity would likely grow too and your fixed hashrate is worth nothing anymore...
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:45:44
So why did it take so long?
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:12:02
While I think you are right about the media, let's not focus on the price too much. As long as innovation is happening and more businesses start accepting it the price will rise automatically. What needs to happen first is a growing userbase, trust and stability.
Edit: Btw it would be foolish to sell now as the price will likely go up :)

Blockchain is just wrong, your [tx]( is already confirmed!
Always be careful with trusting Blockchain, it really has a few problems recently.
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:30:47
Sometimes it's not properly broadcast in the network. Especially if you sent the transaction from a blockchain wallet it might be "stuck" in their systems and not included by a miner. Apparently Blockchain has implemented a workaround now, that emits a resend when a high priority transaction has not been included in a few subsequent blocks. You could however manually resend the transaction in this case.

I would start buying flights with BTC since there are not many local merchants it might be worth a try to change some Bitcoin to local currency using LocalBitcoins if you're brave enough.
Hopefully there are a couple more merchants by the end of the year though.
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:13:52
Of course, but you have to distinguish between talking about the BTC economy (where of course spending is important) and the BTC price which is based on supply and demand.
When I spend the coins I hoarded for years that's great for the BTC economy, but will lower the price.
If you do the full circle of buying BTC to spend them you help the BTC economy, but in sum you don't affect the price.

Oh just one more thing about public and private addresses: there is a mathematical function to derive the public address from a private key as I said, but that function is not reversable. That means you can give me your public address and I can not spend your Bitcoins, but if you give me your private address I can and I will also know your public address.

Assuming 0,20 € per kWh you are telling us the Antminer S1 can live with 100 Watts (0.66 Watts/GH) - the official figure is 1.9 so the pencil mod you mentioned would increase its efficiency by almost 300%.

How fast was your computer or more importantly your internet connection 10 years ago? My connection was almost 1000 times slower. Also Bitcoin developers are working on compressing the blockchain, which would reduce its size quite dramatically. I guess the technical advances will solve that problem and even if not you can still use a light client.
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:09:21
Blockchain.info apparently had very few nodes connected a few days ago, so your transactions didn't propagate across the network.
I just rebroadcasted your transactions and they already have one confirmation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:34:26
Well, I guess there is enough proof that a huge amount of Mt. Gox Bitcoins were moved very recently, so either they are still in their control or they have been stolen recently.

There is no special search for Bitcoin because all restaurants listed there accept is at far as I know.
Of course they don't accept it directly, but Lieferservice.de takes your Bitcoins, converts them to Euros and pays them (minus a fee) to the restaurant. This way they (the restaurants) don't even notice whether you paid in Bitcoin or not.

While I agree it's a good idea to have a plain private key, my point was the seed allows you to recover your Bitcoins in 20 years for sure.

No, otherwise people would already try to append their transactions to other transactions before relaying them for privacy reasons (NSA might believe all inputs belong to the same person).

Isn't one of Bitcoins' advantages the possibility to hide it very well? Could probably lead us to a much fairer system of taxation where you pay taxes when you spend money and maybe also for using services your government provides (e.g. transportation). If we find a way to tackle income inequality as well we'll have a perfectly lean, fair and efficient system :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:46:24
Addresses are not registered anywhere like a bank account. If you uninstall MultiBit and delete your wallet file you just lose access to that address. If somebody sends Bitcoins there they will be lost forever as nobody will ever find the matching private key.

Depends on the client. Bitcoin-Qt generates 100 change addresses in advance, so if you make a backup and lose your wallet 20 transactions afterwards, you still have all the change addresses included. If you made 200 transactions you will likely lose coins.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:39:09

Wow, I'm not sure why I should provide that amount of data - there are reliable exchanges that require less and do not charge 5% on top.

If you want to cash out you can give him an exchange address as well. If you tell us where you are we might be able to recommend a trustworthy exchange.
If you set up a local wallet use one, that does not need to download the blockchain, e.g. Multibit and make sure to backup your wallet before receiving any funds!

Update: Had the same problem. I sent money to them but used a completely different reference number. I did not want to bother them by opening a ticket so I just waited and the money hit my account just one day later as usual :)
(I guess this worked because I sent money in from this bank account earlier so they linked it to me)

While many early-adopters recommend Bitstamp I am convinced the best choice at the moment is [Kraken](
They have lower volume and might be less suited for daytrading or trading big volumes, but for a start they are far better because compared to Bitstamp they offer:
- lower fees (0.2 % instead of 0.5 %)
- almost instant signup (takes like 10 minutes)
- no need to upload identity documents for normal volumes
- bank transfers to their German bank from within SEPA zone are incredibly fast (less than 24 hours mostly between working days)

Congrats! What are you going to do with it?
@_date: 2014-01-22 14:36:32

@_date: 2014-01-30 21:19:11
Ok, but if the transactions wasn't sent obviously your balance shouldn't change. Did you look up the address containing your balance or is it split among multiple addresses?
My guess for the 0.1 "lost" BTC is that Multibit hasn't completely synchronized with the blockchain and is missing a few transfers, so the balance is incorrect.

@_date: 2014-05-19 16:17:20
Well, faucets only cost you time, small-scale mining typically costs you more in hardware and electricity than you get in Bitcoin.
So realistically, since you can buy very small amounts if you don't want to risk a lot of (fiat-)money I would go this path to get a few coins.
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:30:02
I think it's almost impossible to legally operate an ATM in Germany, because you would need a very expensive license as a money transmitting business or something like that.

Well dumping for USD is no problem at all, the only difficult thing is getting a payout via legacy banking. Most exchanges require verification for that, which can take some time.
So you should keep the funds safe (e.g. trezor if you are not experienced enough to create paper/multisig wallet) and sign up for an exchange. When you want to sell you just transfer to the exchange (takes like 30 minutes) and you're done.

They will increasingly get money from transaction fees. As the network will process an ever increasing number of transactions, that does not mean that the individual fees have to increase a lot in order to provide enough incentive for miners.

What's the purpose of this thread?
The owners of that atm are obviously aware of the issue and when they say convenience for users is worth more than a little less risk I think we should accept their decision.
Basically this is what every business accepting credit cards does, they accept the risk of chargebacks for the convenience of accepting cc and possibly generating more revenue.

Welcome :) You should probably have posted in the subreddit, but I am still happy to help you here.
1) The unique thing about Bitcoin is that everybody can generate as many addresses as he/she wants. There is no one who could stop you from doing that and there is no beaurocracy/fees when you create an address.
2) However the "old" financial systems as bank accounts and credit cards are highly regulated and require a lot of paperwork. Because Bitcoin exchanges need to cooperate with banks, so that they can get your fiat money in and out they have no choice but to verify who you are.
Depending on where you are Coinbase, Kraken or Bitstamp are the reliable exchanges that get recommended. There are many regular smaller exchanges though, if you live outside of North America or Europe.
3) Most exchanges have a minimum amount of Bitcoins you have to withdraw, like 0.1 Bitcoin or less. Check their TOS before if you want to trade buy a very small amount.
Well reliable exchanges cost money operating so they have to take a certain percentage. You can however buy Bitcoin from anyone that has them, without any fees.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:32:27
Oh cool, could you elaborate a little bit or provide a link how it works technically?

Blocking incoming traffic is not even a feature, but a characteristic of every router.
Because you have one public IP but several devices behind the router, you can request something from the internet (e.g. a webpage) and the router remembers the request, so that he can route the answer to the correct device. When someone asks your IP for a part of the blockchain (incoming traffic on port 8333) your router does not know which device can answer.
You can however tell your router to route all incoming traffic on port 8333 to the computer running bitcoin-qt and assuming you have to firewall software on your computer blocking that, you will start helping the Bitcoin network.
See [this thread](
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:22:50
It's called cost-averaging, because some buys are at lower and some are at higher prices, but in the end you'll have a pretty average "buy price".

Apparently they are running an old bitcoin client that could not cope with a pretty big block. I.e. the block was rejected by blockchain.info and since all following blocks depend on it their site does not accept any new blocks.

I think it's not a binary question of whether we should have banks or not, its rather what kind of regulation and power is necessary.
It appears to me you think about banks mainly as an entity that stores your money (securely).
However there is much more to it e.g. small countries/companies are completely dependent on a banking system (currently) dominated by the U.S. which harms economic freedom and development by high fees and limitations (like PayPal not allowing European consumers to buy things from Cuba because it's forbidden to do so in the U.S.)

I'm not sure about Coinjar, but that's what I would expect as well. I have payed at least five times at a bar / café with the Android Bitcoin Wallet from Andreas Schildbach and it *never* took more than five seconds, usually less (even though I sometimes had a pretty slow internet connection using Edge).
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:28:11
I've seen this a couple of times when a block was published just a few seconds after another block. My guess is the transactions that second miner was including just happened to be mined by the person before him and in the meantime there have not been any new transactions to include (since it takes some computing power to create a complete block template miners might actually update the contents just a few times per minute)

Sure, but that's the current state. Since you reload the code from their page every time you use it, they could just embed a little addition, that sends your password over to them.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:55:57
You could override this transaction with another one that has a fee if it should not confirm eventually.
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:21:17
I guess everyone who owns Bitcoins at the moment knows the risk and already deals with it somehow. Also if people know your return procedure before how can they blame you for that?
Just give a small discount for Bitcoin payments (I'd say 1% is enough) and then customers can decide whether that's incentive enough to accept the risks :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:57:10
Coinsfortech looks promising. Let us know what you chose in the end please :)
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:59:28
Yeah, it's just strange that they turn down a customer (in the end they would make money with your interest payments) and thereby proving the need for a better system, where people can not just be refused basic banking services.

You mean how long does it take to buy Bitcoin at an ATM? Usually less than a minute, it's really instant.

Get a paywall.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:26:30
Right, but the point here is that the Bitcoin bank would likely not know that much about you.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:18:57
Me too, I'm positively surprised :)
I'm not sure whether that's selective perception, but it feels as if Germany is really big in terms of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:47:43
I think it should work the same way as Bitcoin tickets (e.g. for the [Btc1k Party]( often do.
You just include a private key qr code, so basically a paperwallet. When the prescription is redeemed you have to give either the qr code or the private key directly to the pharmacist. He then checks whether there is a balance (can be a very tiny amount) on it that comes from the doctor's address and transfers that balance out - now the prescription is not valid anymore :)

What about Kraken or Bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:50:06
There's a slight possibility your computer has already been identified by malware altering your random number generation, so your keys might be vulnerable even though generated offline.
Apart from that please make sure to have sufficient backups (e.g. printout stored in different locations.)
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:09:59
I would just try other tools, e.g. import that address to Blockchain.org or Multibit and try to spend from there (with a fee attached).
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:00:44
Maybe the reason why Bitstamp just switched back to requiring 6 confirmations instead of only 3 before deposits are credited to the account?
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:26:52
Why are/were you using BIPS when you keep the coins anyway instead of just accepting Bitcoins directly?
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:02:02
No risk no fun :)
First payout is through now, so it's not a simple scam at least.
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:32:19
I don't think its about requiring that information.
If you had a Bitcoin bank you could easily execute transfers privately (your own wallet) that you don't want them to know about. Even if you would use them like you use a bank today, they might not know you donated to, let's say "Wikileaks", because they just see a Bitcoin address and not a uniquely identifiable bank account number.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:55:48
I also think e4btc is somewhat fishy, but since they get EUR from Bitpay they have no incentive/reason to react to falling or rising BTC prices.
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:47:20
I'm always wondering why paypal is even allowed on localbitcoins.
How do you report them?
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:08:29
That's exactly the point. Why should you give away your complete identity to Bitstamp to trade for 0.5% fees, when you can do the same thing more conveniently at Kraken for only 0.2% :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:10:42
Sounds like malware.
@_date: 2014-06-05 10:54:38
There are only a few in Palma, according to [Coinmap](
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:43:46
I would consider Bitstamp and Kraken the safest and most sophisticated exchanges. Maybe Vault of Satoshi as well if you're in Canada.
For security you might want to buy a low amount first and experiment a bit and then buy a larger sum and split it to multiple exchanges / wallets (such as Blockchain.info , Bitalo.com or paper wallets).
@_date: 2014-04-30 14:56:15
You made a pretty simple mistake.
There is 39,136 kW used constantly, but that is 39,136 kWh per hour, not per second. So the actual power cost is 3600 times lower than your calculated.
- Electricity cost: 3,913.6$ per hour
- Bitcoins mined: 150 per hour = 67,500$ reward
This makes sense considering many people are running old hardware or paying more for electricity.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:06:54
Still I think buying low and selling high is actually good for Bitcoin, because if everyone did it perfectly right (which is of course impossible) we'll have zero volatility.
On the other hand I think you're right about the fact that it's better to buy something with it then sell. BTW Bitpay claims its [rates]( are better than what you get to sell for on any other exchange and it seems to be true most of the time.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:27:47
 you can still just export the private key from Bitcoin-Qt and head over to another client if you want. But please before you do anything, make sure to back up your wallet.dat
@_date: 2014-10-01 09:15:49
You just deleted the blockchain, so Bitcoin-Qt does not know how many you have. Wait for it to re-download and your balance should be restored.
Before the download is completed I would not recommend to try to restore any backup or at least make sure you backup the *current* wallet.dat as well just in case.
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:22:48
At least they include a lot of transactions now. I'd rather like you to rant about DiscusFish.

Can we buy the book using Bitcoin somewhere?
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:07:49
That sounds almost impossible. I could only think of contacting a reputable Localbitcoins seller and mail him cash.
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:27:12
Well for example if you have 2 Bitcoins on your phone you can just sent several pre-signed transactions to that service (like for 2 Bitcoins, for 1.9 Bitcoins etc) and the service would look up the balance and use the closest matching transaction so *most* of your coins would be safe. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:40:38
If you're not afraid of verification requirements, I can only recommend Kraken. Signup is pretty quick and you can send money without any added costs using SEPA payments. They usually arrive in your account within 24 hours.

@_date: 2014-05-05 14:55:47
Have checked out your store repeatedly, but the prices were always like 20% higher than from other reputable shops and while I do not need a BTC discount, I am not willing to pay a premium for the possibility to spend some Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:43:14
Well looks like two deposits have been made after this post, so we just have to wait what happens to see whether it works. Naturally the operator can stop it at any time and just take the remaining balance.
Will give it a try soon if it turns out to work.

Just "spam" transactions that will likely never confirm. Don't worry, has been addressed here before. Just search this reddit.
@_date: 2014-05-05 12:58:00
Usually you can verify the balance (only needs public key) without peeling the sticker (which reveals the private key).

At least it doesn't look like phishing. What could anyone make out of this data?
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:30:44
Nope, people can still send/receive money with their wallets (except Blockchain.info) and there is no main server.
Alternatives to Blockchain.info are blockr.io and blockexplorer.com.
Saying Bitcoin is down because Blockchain.info is not reachable is like saying the U.S. Dollar stopped working because the Citibank website is down.
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:20:32
Sounds like your in Argentina, right?
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:11:02
If there is a little green tick on the status bar of Bitcoin-Qt you are fully synced.
Generally there are no different send and receive addresses, but you can generate new addresses of any transfer you receive to maintain anonymity in Bitcoin-Qt.
It is possible to only use a single address like for a paper wallet. Some clients to this, but if someone does a transaction with you, he can track all your other transactions, so that's not the best option probably.
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:49:08

If someone has control over your device(s) why should he disable your logout button instead of just stealing your funds?
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:15:14
That's what I was afraid you'd done.
The addresses tab is like an address book. You can save addresses from others, like friends to send Bitcoins to.
Since you must have created this entry "mining", where did you get that address you pasted there? 
If you made that address up somehow the coins are gone...
Next time please make sure to send payments to one of your addresses in the "receive" tab. These will never get deleted from your wallet, so you can use them as often as you want.

In Europe you can get a Level 2 verified account at [Kraken]( in less than 10 minutes. Bank withdrawals take less than 24 hours on weekdays and their fee is 0.2%, so a lot better than Bitstamp/Coinbase/Bitpay. You can only withdraw EUR though, not USD.

I still don't understand for example why Dogecoin is better. You claim more people are spending it, which might only be true relative to how many own dogecoin, cause that's a lot less than for bitcoin.
Also how can dogecoin be a better currency when it's accepted by a lot fewer merchants? Can I buy a flight for dogecoin?

While I think you're right about taking financial advise in terms of serious investing from strangers here or anywhere else, it's also a little too general to just assume nobody here as experience outside Bitcoin.
The financial system in the Western World definitely is not perfect, but simply calling all stocks/bonds "fucked up" is nonsense as well. There are functioning companies with good business models whose stocks or bonds are worth buying from a value investment point of view.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:15:50
I'm on your side. I am surprised anyone is selling for PayPal, but I'd consider your risk pretty low.
Maybe you should try to include your BTC address in the Paypal checkout, so that the merchant can not claim to have sent the BTC to an address you provided, which is not.

Assuming you're using Bitcoin-Qt the only way is to export your private key using the debug window and importing it into a light client such as Multibit where you can spend it immediately.
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:41:56
How is Localbitcoins different? You still have to trust them with your money and for a potentially longer timeframe, since you can likely not trade as instantly as with a "real" exchange.

I don't agree with that. If you'd ask people to vote on Central Bank Policy I guess the outcome would not be what is currently done, so you have a difference between what people want and what actually happens. That means they do _not_ have control, not even indirectly.

Either it is really simple or the people at Slush are just much more competent than the whole Bitcoin core team then.
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:43:07
Well this mail is from 2015 and in the Hongkong agreement afaik the core team promised to publish block-size increase hard-fork code. Has not happened yet and it really shouldn't be difficult.
It seems to me this is mainly an issue of what one believes their true intentions are since what they posted can be laid out to support multiple options.
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:19:44
Well please show us the opposite. 
Just look at the mempool right now - the fact that the core team does not even seem to think about a "temporary" blocksize increase (e.g. to get Bitcoin back to a working state until SegWit has been activated / people have been convinced to use it) worries me.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:19:00

The article is from April 2014. As long as you / someone else here doesn't have any additional information I would say the informational value is zero.
We don't know how much of these 200k coins has been spent/liquidated already and since Kraken is now onboard with organizing the distribution of the remaining coins to the creditors I'd expect them to pay back Bitcoin for most creditors.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:16:33
This is a blatant lie. Even if you send BTC to the BCH address, it will show up correctly (as BTC).
@_date: 2015-08-21 10:01:44
True. Even though I'd like to add some perspective - 200k coins are currently mined every two months. If those are liquidated, there will be selling pressure, but I think it will be bearable.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:21:29
Are you sure? I think Bitcoin-Qt does. Even if it doesn't it should give you a txid and you could use the debug window and the command getrawtransaction to get the transaction, then broadcast using any other software or [Blockchain.info](

Probably at some point someone will try and report that it does indeed work :)
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:50:22
Maybe try Destinia.com. I figured they often even have better prices.

Regarding your analogy - did Gold fail because hoarding/trading it was made illegal in the 1930s?
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:14:05
Why not give it a try? Risking downvotes != risking death ;)

what about spending an individual input? I have a wallet with many inputs, that are not yet linked and would like to use a few of them individually.
I have tried to do that manually by sending exactly the amount + fees that is in one output, but a different output was chosen (even though I verified the sum of the actual transaction did match the one input exactly).
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:12:06
Unless you update the pre-signed transaction after every manual transfer out of the cold wallet. This way you can be sure all inputs you know at that point will still be spendable before the next manual withdrawal. Of course deposits made after the pre-signing will not be included.

@_date: 2015-10-07 18:50:59
While I agree, that setting this parameter is a good idea and helps secure the network, it does not seem to be helpful in this particular situation, right?
Fees seem to be higher than 1 satoshi / byte even...
Looks like someone's got some coins to spend.
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:02:10
You'll have to create a new transaction I suppose. Do you have a backup seed (usually 12 words)? If yes try to import that seed into another wallet and you should see the entire balance and be able to spend your coins.
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:07:38
Thanks, looks like I didn't do the math properly...
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:45:38
I understand that by kicking out "random" txs it would also kick out "regular" transactions. What I don't get is why it should keep the spam. Please explain.

So now one can even make money selling a private key to an address than once contained a high BTC balance to the Dragons Den?
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:55:38
Yeah but then, he already gets a similar/higher amount of money than he would on a basic income don't you think?
I'm afraid people would stop donating at all and think "well he has the basic income so he'll survive".
In my opinion the point here is not him starving, but the fact that millions of people use his software without appreciating it (financially) at all. I bet many of them use comparatively expensive hardware and could easily afford to donate a few bucks.
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:41:55
Well Bitcoin-Qt is open source. I could just let my trojan check for Bitcoin-Qt and if it finds it replace the binary with my slightly changed version that either directly sends the coins to me once the wallet is unlocked or just sends me the wallet.dat + the password.
This way it does not matter how you input your password.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:33:16
[Using their API](
I think they made it too complicated though. You have to set up a http or https server that serves that address as well.
Either you already do and have to publish that adress there (maybe you just don't want to do that because that page is accessed by a lot of people) or you don't and for the *chance* to win a few USD it's overkill imho.
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:02:10
Well you could always sell e.g. at Bitfinex so no one will now it's you. I would never want to depend on an entity like them to hold a significant amount of money though (you'd have to wait until the price crashes and you rebuy BTC)...
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:04:05
There are also mainly positive quotes to be found on [Wikiquote]( Maybe we can add some more critical ones like from Krugman!
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:53:26
I think this is a theoretical issue.
I don't think the FBI has many restrictions about how to force him to release the passwords...

"Bitcoin may charge a fee" - could someone please ask the CEO of Bitcoin to clarify this?
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:59:25
But if they offered Bitcoin payment with slightly less fees they'd drive their profits even more, since they could keep all of it!
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:27:19
Oh - you're probably right! Sorry I missed that...
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:47:07
I think using Wau also has a main advantage for German citizens (such as me). Since they are a kind of "charity" donations to them are tax-deductable. So I can roughly donate 133% of what I intended to give while only paying 100%.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:52:50
At least Wau Holland is definitely trustworthy. It's a registered charity that has been active around such topics for a while. They have been the payment processor of WikiLeaks after Paypal and CC companies were stopped dealing with them. Also donations to them are tax-deductable in Germany because of the charity status.
However I'm not saying that rules out any possibility of them losing the key to that address...
@_date: 2015-10-31 11:29:49
Thanks for your reply. Maybe it would be less work to display which inputs will be used for a given transaction? Would already allow for some control (e.g. making sure certain inputs will not be mixed)
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:54:12
Yeah and open the firewall, regularly install security updates for apache, allocate more RAM...
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:17:47
Ryanair would make so much sense. They could offer even more competitive pricing and/or improve their profit margin with extremely limited risk/effort imho :)
Also you're kind of forced to book directly if you want to fly with them, the only resellers accepting Bitcoin charge you more than Ryanair charges including the credit card processing fee :( So a way to pay with BTC without losing money in the process would be awesome.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:57:00
At least for a guy as technically versed as the GPG developer :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:43:26
Well, I guess most people here (like me) are enthusiasts, so we like to spend our coins. It is pretty convenient to just quickly check coinmap.org every now and then, especially when you travel somewhere.
I would not buy stuff I do not need just to support Bitcoin, but why not try a café/restaurant/bar that accepts it? I actually discovered some nice places this way.
I would also buy some framed photography if I came across a piece I like, but would probably not buy that online.
So I guess no matter what you're selling, if there is a demand for it a (growing) part of your potential customers should like the option to pay with Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:33:22
It really depends on how paranoid you are and on how many coins you have.
For example I like the Android Wallet from Andreas Schildbach and since I have a backup I would store maybe up to 1 BTC on it. Of course you should have a decent lockscreen security and ideally encrypt your device. However I consider it quite unlikely nowadays that if you lose your phone someone will extract the wallet file from a locked device before you can transfer the coins to another address. That person would have to know you have Bitcoins on it.
For travelling a web wallet would probably a good idea, too unless you have a secure laptop.
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:45:19
Sure! Try Cryptothrift and Coingig!
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:28:06
There's so much more to buy with Bitcoin and take some fees away from Visa and the others. Just head over to coinmap.org :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:29:51
No address and not even a possibility to contact you? Looks phishy to me, even though I think it is legit.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:33:14
You have a pretty cool gf :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:53:22
How can you be too young to buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:27:45
Well it might be possible to restore the wallet file if the SD card was not overwritten, but the public key (wallet address) will only show you the balance, but not grant access to it.
Edit: try [photorec]( if your bitcoin balance was worth any effort
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:56:26
Nope, their IT is centralized and mostly outsourced. However some things like account blacklists might be editable by each local group.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:20:06
If you were using Andreas Schildbach's Android Wallet afaik there's no import mechanism, so you have to copy the wallet file to a computer and grab the private key. You can then use Mt. Gox, Blockchain.info or a local Bitcoin client to import the key and regain access to your bitcoins.
For the future I'd recommend doing a backup with Titanium Backup. This way you can restore the balance back to the Android Wallet (but you have to keep the backup file safe because anyone that has access to it including most apps on your smartphone can steal your coins).
Edit: typos
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:05:55
I'm pretty happy with namecheap.com
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:33:26
Great, glad that it helped. No need for a tip btw, I still have my Android Wallet and got a good backup :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:27:18
Well, this has been posted just 30 minutes before! Sorry op, but please downvote everyone.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:05:11
The address coinbase shows you is just for incoming transactions. Apart from that they store your coins internally, the benefit for you is anonymity for anyone without internal access to their systems. So if you send me some bitcoins, it will come from one or many addresses they own, but that do not belong to dedicated users.
No need to worry about your balance though. If you want to truly have control over your coins move them to a local wallet, but make sure to back up the keys before you do so.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:37:18
Which is better than the BTC logo, because it provides additional information. I guess most people are looking for food on Coinmap, so it should be clearly distinguishable from other things like online shops.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:19:35
I'd say it's pretty simple: If something is well-known and established it takes something a lot better or very good marketing to be a real competition.
Right now Bitcoin gains traction, trust and popularity every day, so either something a lot better is developed (I don't see that currently, but it might happen) or someone takes a lot of effort to push a similar system with a different name.
So it *would* be absolutely possible in my opinion for e.g. the U.S. government to fork Bitcoin, rename it and push it by accepting it for taxes and stuff and encouraging businesses to accept it.
The likelihood of this scenario - who knows.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:50:41
The situation has not changed at all in the last couple of weeks. Bitcoin is an incredible technology and looks very promising.
Consequently investing in Bitcoin can be very profitable, but is incredibly risky. If you thought about this before you have invested some money you would not miss too much. In this case hold on for at least a few months and you will very likely not regret this decision.
Maybe you should also get more involved by talking merchants into accepting Bitcoin, helping people here on reddit or something else.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:04:56
Well I actually had some little problems with them, but their service is absolutely great. They always got back to me in less than 10h and fixed the problems first try all the time.
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:48:03
Just wait until the package maintainer releases an update. 0.8.6 does not fix any critical bugs for Linux so it should not be a problem for you to wait a few days.
If you want to be cutting edge just install it directly from Bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:34:41
Where's this?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:55:51
Sell them for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:07:08
Sure, the price is absolutely irrelevant, since I'm buying back the Bitcoins I spend.
I will not decide whether to eat out based on the BTC price and when I'm at a place that takes it I will of course pay with Bitcoin!
But I have to admit I (unknowingly) did all my christmas shopping early, so I profited from the higher prices :)
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:19:50
It depends a lot on what your requirements are.
I like the blockchain.info wallet, as it is open source and apparently pretty secure. However I would not store great amounts of money there.
If you're using an exchange that you trust you might also leave some coins with them, you should just be aware of the risks, since you do not have control over your coins there and you might be more tempted to sell (and lose money long term) if there's a crash.
