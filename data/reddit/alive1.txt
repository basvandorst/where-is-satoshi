I see it as bitcoin has paved the way for doge, to make it easier. For me it's not either-or. I hold and believe in both

I'm not saying you're wrong, but... I've heard your argument being used against Bitcoin verbatim.

Hey I bought some bitcoin back in may, just spent about $50 on localbitcoins. havent regretted it. You're not too late at least put in a little cash (money that would go on candy or beers anyway) in it so you wont be kicking yourself in a years time.

If you you wanted somewhere to live you can could take those apples and say hey, i'll brew a you some kickass cider with these apples but I need a place to stay and brew what do you think?

I don't really know. I mean to me that image does not represent bitcoin that well except for some very specific cases of it. I'm just talking about *apples* man.

I am against artificial restrictions yes.

After reading a lot of the responses here I think it sort of does a decent job of equating 'monetary exchange' or 'banking' to free apples. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:40:16
Apples are free.

I'd buy a rolls royce for about $1000. That's what a rolls royce is worth to me right now.

Worthless for selling, yeah.
They're still delicious and tasty, and can be used to provide nutrition or apple juice or cider with a little more work.
It's just that everyone has access to the apples now instead of restricting the supply artificially. Everyone can now eat apples instead of having to buy them. Everyone can have an apple instead of just the ones who can afford them.
"worth" is so subjective.
