I am investing in bitcoin later on tonight for the first time. I was looking to do it through coinbase. Thanks so much for the post

There was a post or ama recently where a redditor claimed that he sold his for 200,000 if I'm remembering correctly.

I could see that. People can't talk politics on Reddit without getting pissed off or it devolving into "libtards", "Nazis" and all that shit.

As far as I could tell, personally, he's into tighter borders. He's against the current immigration "crisis" that's happening in Europe and a good amount of people are saying it's because he's racist despite what the immigration is actually causing to the area. It depends on who you speak to though. 
I'm assuming that's why he thinks he's a "bellend" because that's the most popular response so I could be wrong. I'm also American, so the only thing I have to go by on the immigration issue in Europe is a bipartisan media. You probably know more about all that then I do.

I find myself wondering this too. I ask my parents who were raised in the 50's and 60's and they said it wasn't this bad but who knows. Maybe it's advancements in communications and media like the internet

You can't rationally disinclude the left for the same. I'm sure the far right lies. I know for a fact the right does. And the moderates. And the left as well as the far left. Saying the far right lies doesn't tell me much.
All I'm saying is we don't know all that much considering the left and right lie about everything all the time. Politics

Can I afford a GPU now? I've been building a computer for a month and the last piece I need is the GPU. The computer has been done (minus the GPU) for 3 weeks lmao. I have no one to blame but myself, I guess, seeing as I support the cryptocurreny movement
