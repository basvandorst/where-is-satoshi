Using the acronym 'opsec' is poor opsec, as it betrays the fact that you have a need to know about opsec.  Use ['strategery']( instead.  Now that I've admitted to having knowledge of counter-intelligence, I'll just sit here and wait for the authorities to arrest me for being a Russian spy.

I'm not that strong on Andreas trivia, but I learned many years ago while writing fraud detection software for a company with millions of subscribers - there are very distinct classes of people that emerge out of a large enough population.

Sure, only smart contracts can remove the requirement of trust from activities more complex than simple transactions.  So while you don't need smart contracts to "automate rent payments", you do if you don't want to trust a financial institution to do it, or whatever legal framework which is required to compel the financial institution to make you whole if they should fail to make payments, or... recurse down that train of thought however far you'd like.
It isn't a matter of what was impossible is now possible with smart contracts, it is a matter for what impractical is now practical.  You technically could build a space shuttle with only carpentry tools, but you wouldn't want to.  Smart contracts are just better tools.

That would be the most straight forward implementation, but not the only way to do it.  Instead of getting into that I think I see a much more obvious example to point to: "but I just don't see a niche."  Payment channels through the LN.  As somebody who, many years ago, actively traded on the forex and various other traditional exchanges - it is plain to see that counterparty risk is eliminated between components of wallstreet.  That is a tremendous speedup and cost reduction that would otherwise be impossible without smart contracts.
I guess I take my perspective as a programmer for granted when it comes to the fallibility of real world contracts and business activities, compared to the guaranteed outcomes in the abstract world of mathematics.  There is so much slack in meatspace to be taken up by a trustless and predictable alternative method.

Obviously not.  He declared their problems to be on their banking partner's end, but to make that statement truthfully he would have had to of taken a look at their backoffice.

Him knowing their tech situation, then going on camera and saying "The present problems are related to banks" is a form of lie called 'dissimulation'.

Not really anything specific, as it would require me to give more information about my former employer than I'd like - sorry.  Generally speaking, people in aggregate are incredibly predictable and when they identify a weak point in the system - they pounce... Through a great deal of simulation and backtesting I found that it was more profitable to cut folks out as soon as they display the slightest aberration in behavior (compared to the norm).  Also, your antifraud guys should be paying for themselves - if they can't quantify savings then you need to get rid of them.  I know that sounds like business 101, but more often than not management often looks at security and loss prevention differently.
If you really want to know more about this stuff, there are a ton of academic papers written on the subject - the more interesting ones are usually related to the telecommunication industry.

Yes, and the choice of reduced utility as well.  See how that works?

It would be safer for you to just turned off you computer and stare at the wall.

That is what I hear every time somebody trots out an altcoin.

If such advice is commonly followed then bitcoin cat burglars will start targeting people who don't mention 'opsec', because they'll know that you know that they know...


Yes it is.  As everybody knows, nobody can lie on the internet - so if somebody wants to invest their time in tracking me down and expose themselves to the risk of arrest... as I told the terrorists in Iraq: bring 'em on.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:43:13


lol, logic.  Earlier you hinted at being a "security nerd", I wonder - because you seem to struggle with some incredibly simple game theory that is organic to the world of security.  Risk vs reward (or more accurately in this case: utility).  leaked personal info (or lied, no way to know) in order to make his point, because presumably in his estimate, the risk of that information being used against his interests are incredibly small.  You obviously judge the utility to be of lower value than the risk, likely because you overestimate the risk.  You don't have to take it personally, you just disagree about a couple of risk and value estimates.

@_date: 2018-01-02 03:55:22


I suppose that depends on how you define "need" in this context.  You can always qualify the need to a finer level of granularity in order to answer in the affirmative.  For example: do you need smart contracts in order to provide insurance policies?  No.  Do you need smart contracts in order to provide insurance policies at the lowest possible cost and the fastest possible settlement time?  Yes.  Add in some oracles, maybe mix in some web of trust, and you've got contracts that can respond to real world events.  Just think of how simple farm related insurance contracts would be.


I totally disagree, I think that we're looking at something that will bring such a tremendous economic advantage that it is pretty close to being an event horizon - a point beyond which prediction becomes incredibly hard.  Like somebody in the 60s wondering about the business value of home PCs and the internet.  I understand that this all sounds like some pie in the sky gushing, but consider this: the massive shift in the economic value of the internet was when it went from statically served pages for human consumption to exposed API where machines could directly interact with one-another's services.  We're seeing something similar with money now, and it is incredibly exciting to consider the possibilities of software agents operating independent of meatspace business and finance constraints.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:07:19
I'm reminded of a 60 Minutes segment from many years ago when they were interviewing early Google employees.  They were asked about how their lives have changed following the massive valuation of the company's stock, what sort of extravagant gifts have they got themselves, that sort of thing.  One engineer said that he threw away all of his old socks and bought new socks of the same size and color, so that he'd never have to search for mating pairs again... I imagine Andreas will do something along the same lines.

OK, as such a person - what do you think the ideal price is?  Are we above that price?  No?  Then don't worry about it.
You should only be worried if you are in fact not in it for "the core principals", but instead in for a quick return.  In that case, good luck trying to time the market, but I'll tell you up front - you'll fail and lose money.  I say this as a guy involved in bitcoin, since the single digits, purely for political reasons.

I just went through this - only waited 8 hours though.  After I submitted another transaction, using the change address of the prior unconfirmed transaction as the source - and increasing the fee to the going rate, both confirmed on the next block.

Also, while I can't imagine stealing from my own family, I'd prefer to not even have the possibility of being tempted to do so.  But in the end I just said fuck it and threw a note in an encrypted volume, pallets of toasters don't come cheap.

No, don't do that.  You use the change address of your prior unconfirmed transaction as the source - sending the balance to a new address in your control.  If you don't know what a change address is then you should totally ignore everything I've just said - it is pretty far off the beaten path for most users... as is manually setting the mining fee.

Yeah, like how they did with [illegal numbers]( that totally worked.  Anybody else remember when the US succeeded in preventing the spread of [strong cryptography]( that it viewed as a national security risk?


You've got that backwards, the cryptoanarchists were here in the beginning - but have been largely replaced by people who simply want a slightly improved world, not a radically changed one.  I can't remember the last time I saw a serious cypherpunk argument here, it was quite common years ago and it certainly isn't what is drawing people in now days.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:08:20


Well in that case you aren't describing law, because you are talking about a world without objective fact.


Again, there do exist cryptographic algorithms that perfectly conceal the identities of users.  But even if that were not true, your logic is completely broken: just replace in your question the concept of cryptography with "legislation".  It then becomes clear that law isn't what protects against the use of force, it is simply the lack of will.  You know what doesn't yield to force?  Crypto :)

I agree, I think he just chickened out - hell, [he wrote about M-PESA]( several years before that interview took place.  So he knew that a currency can function outside of government control.  So I disagree with you about any other potential interpretation because the question was pretty simple: 'people think this might be the next big thing, what do you think?'
As far as state intervention in the future... I don't put a great deal of weight on it, the states can either accelerate adoption or slow it - but they can't stop it.  There will be a tremendous need for an uncontrolled crypto currency in the very near future, when autonomous software agents become common.  Their integration with meat space will be a huge chokepoint and it would be insane to expect them to render service and depend on payment that can be halted or otherwise interfered with.

Also, don't listen to the hyper conservative old money types.  If you are young and you aren't living hand to mouth: you should be taking the financial risks now that you can't take later in life.  Ask yourself how much you think the entire bitcoin ecosystem will be worth by the time you plan on taking profit and invest accordingly.  The run up in price is simply a large amount of moneyed individuals and organizations judging the future value of bitcoin to be much higher than what it is presently priced at by the sellers who either need the fiat now or suspect that the price is where it should be at.

Oh wait, maybe don't sell... as you don't seem to be aware of the the concept of the future :)  Seriously, consider the way finance works in general - it is all future based.  While I would love to see bitcoin technologically advance at the same pace of the speculative price increase... that basically never happens for large projects.  You know that company stock prices swing based on projected revenue right?
Yes, there is a downside to unsophisticated speculators getting involved - volatility.  But there is an upside, shovel salesmen.

I'm not, not even in the most charitable light.  If you care to elaborate then I'm sure you'll get a point by point rebuttal.


I wonder where you believe the price should be at and what the justification for that evaluation is.

It sounds like you're new here - this sentiment long predates the get rich quick types.  Just look at the [genesis block](
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:39:04
Do not buy bitcoin with the intent to get rich quick... you'll find it stressful and you'll end up having your financial decisions ruled by emotion instead of logic.  Ask yourself if you actually understand what bitcoin is, if you don't - you have a lot of reading ahead of you.  Once you've done that, consider the long term effects of bitcoin - what is now possible that otherwise wouldn't be.  Estimate the value of all the wonderful things you've just imaged and all the existing inefficiency eliminated.  Ask yourself if the current price is above or below that estimate.  Act accordingly.

You better rethink that position now and save yourself a major disappointment in the future.  I got involved when bitcoin was in the single digits and I have no doubt that many of my coins are counted among the so-called lost coins in stories that go around every once and a while.  I had a nice big round number in mind for when I'd consider myself a wealthy man - even had a little song picked out to celebrate the occasion ([Peter Gabriel - Big Time](  Well when we blew through that number a while ago I didn't feel any different, so I doubled the figure - which was again blown through.  I'm actually feeling worse now than I did several years ago... seriously considering overseas volunteer work now - if that doesn't make me happy then I'm truly fucked.

Well below ideal, like so far below ideal that I don't even bother coming up with a dollar value.  I'll tell you how I'll know when we hit a logical value: when software agents are common and actively using the blockchain.  We are very close to a point where software is written and set free to conduct business on its own, I'm not talking about self aware AI or trading bots - I'm talking about something in between the two.  These agents will be free to pay their own physical world costs (hosting, equipment purchase and rental, taxes and business license fees, etc), pay for contract software developers to improve whatever success metric they converge on, and collect revenue for products created and services rendered.  These agents will be a massive economic boom, but what currency will they work in?  Certainly not one that can be interfered with in meat space...
This is just one killer app for bitcoin, one of the more obvious ones.  I couldn't care any less about people buying fancy coffee with a bitcoin app on their iPhone.  I want to see the settlement apparatus cut out of finance like the vestigial organ it is.  I want to see currency manipulation between trading states made impossible.  I want to see the rollback of a wasteful consumer economy fueled by purposeful inflation, the great theft and transfer of wealth from the bottom directly to the top.
We aren't even close to the correct price for bitcoin, it allows so much that would otherwise be impossible.
*edit*: thank you anonymous gilder of gilditude, first gilding I've gotten in all my years on reddit.  That actually really worries me - is my comment that informative on r/Bitcoin?  Because if that is the case, I might need to actually make an effort to discuss this sort of thing more frequently here - all this bubble talk strikes me as disconcertingly shortsighted and firmly rooted in a misunderstanding of bitcoin's fundamental properties.

You have succeeded in dragging us pretty far off the original point though.  Cryptography requires no legal protection, when implemented correctly, because it relies on the nature of the universe instead of the laws of man for protection.

Yup, but definitely not in a way that you've done for years as a developer on *nix.  Check out those makefiles, I can't express how maddening it is as programmer who lives in the terminal to have to develop on Windows.  In my case it worked out this way: try to trick Windows into being less terrible by using Cygwin... give up on that due to all the impossible to debug problems that introduces, repeat with Mingw.  Try to write the majority of your code in your home OS, leaving the GUI crap for Windows tooling, find that the majority of your time is spent trying to knit those things together.  Learn that WIN32 is absolutely insane and that Microsoft isn't kidding about how much they don't want anybody to use it.  Throw in the towel and embrace the suck of VC++, dedicate yourself to doing it the Windows way - feel dirty.
Obviously Hal could have been a much more stubborn developer than I, but after I was forced to abandon my development environment and my build tools - my code was nowhere near as clean as it would normally be.  I've seen this happen with other developers who are forced into Windows development - at some point they just stop trying to be C programmers.

I certainly don't hold it against anybody when they want to make short term gains, but we aren't talking about the same thing in this case.  Backtest your strategy over any prior point in bitcoin's history.  That is what I'm talking about, there are a lot of folks who regret their short-sighted thinking.  So when I say "That is yet to be seen", I'm talking about opportunity cost - when instead of simply going long, one eaks out small gains from swing trading.


And yet our interaction began with you talking about tulip mania, which is the clearest possible indicator that you lack a fundamental understanding of the topic under discussion.  If you'd like we can revisit that.  My analysis is based on ~~observation~~ participation in the BTC markets since 2012.  My first couple of years involved a great deal of trading, always long, using leveraged margin and arbitrage between exchanges and pairs.  I've also developed a lot of software within the bitcoin ecosystem.  So I'm very familiar with both the tech side and the economic side of bitcoin.  Furthermore, the "therefore it has value to me" part of your statement... if you can't articulate your rationale - then your really need to reconsider your actual understanding.  While a doctor's opinion on a medical procedure is supported by "analysis" and "knowledge" (simply put: experience), he can clearly explain how he arrived at the conclusion without an appeal to authority.  Just go through my post history if you want to see what my opinion is based on, or if you'd like I can directly address specific technical/economic/political concerns.  All you've provided in the way of rationale is "Read about Tulipmania in XVII century", and again, we can revisit how silly a comparison that is.


Wow, now you are just being dishonest.  When did I ever deem a retraction "impossible"?  When I pointed to the 8 year history of bitcoin I couldn't have made it any more clear I was speaking from a long term perspective... if you want to declare some sort of victory for calling a retraction then go for it, congrats - but don't lie about it and say that it was "deemed impossible" by me.  I actually took a little over 30k in profit, to round out taxes, at 18.8k.  I was well aware of the coming retraction, but where we part ways is my long position (which makes it very important to time a bottom) vs your short term swing trading (which doesn't have a re-entrance strategy).  If you know of a way to share gdax trading history safely, like with metatrader public feeds, I'd be happy to back that up with evidence.


I've got plenty of patience, I've been long for 5 years and not only survived multiple downturns - but expanded my position on the backs of those shorting.  Just remember, you declared "...it is over, it will not reach new high. At least in a few years."  If you are interested in further discussion, I'm open to it, but you will need to actually start providing rationale - or it is unlikely to go anywhere beyond dick waving.

Strangely enough I came because of the economics and stayed because of the tech.  Not the economics in the sense of 'get rich quick', but from the Austrian economics angle.  After reading the white paper and going through the code I quickly realized that in a world of software agents, meat space money will be a huge problem.  Bitcoin is leaning very hard into the world we are about to enter.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:39:40


That is yet to be seen, lots of people in the past have thought themselves clever for fully liquidating their position in the hope that they'll find a bottom - only to see a very fast reverse.  Even more people forget how badly they fuck themselves in making it impossible to take advantage of long term capital gains tax rates, which becomes pretty important when you start counting things in 'millions'.


Everybody is entitled to an opinion, so long as you know that you've only provided a completely unsupported opinion.

This was sort of a head-scratcher for me, if you were really concerned then you'd have checked my user activity.  Had you done that you'd have seen me looking for tax advice on reducing exposure for a million dollar short term capital gain a months before your attempt at a taunt.

@_date: 2017-11-27 07:48:40
Your third point actually addresses your first point.  The state intentionally inflates currency, reducing the purchasing power of those who save.  This newly created money is injected into the economy at the very top through interest free loans to financial institutions, who really don't need or deserve it.  This drives unsophisticated investors to simply throw money at Wall-street in the hopes that they can, at the very least, protect their purchasing power.

Bitcoin was explicitly created to address the political issues: ["The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"](

While Ron Paul is an interesting politician, a more helpful place to direct people is the actual birthplace of bitcoin: [the cypherpunks](  That is actually how I got into it back in the day and I'm not sure how well I would have survived the insanity of the last several years without a firm political foundation.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:13:21
I'm not talking about just the bitcointalk forums, I'm talking about the usenet newsgroups that long preceded bitcointalk - that would necessarily precede bitcointalk in order to be the "actual birthplace of bitcoin".  Very few people understand these people's contribution to the world in not only political ideas but also major strategic wins, we utterly destroyed Clinton's attempts to fuck up the world with the [clipper chip]( and the concept of [weaponized encryption](  Ron Paul, for a long time (still?), couldn't even bring himself to call bitcoin "money" - he provides a very weak basis of understanding the goals and long term impact of bitcoin because his association to it is purely motivated by convenience.  I say this as a guy who generally likes Paul and voted for him - if e-gold was still around he'd be talking that up and badmouthing bitcoin.

I certainly wouldn't have considered myself an early adopter several years ago, but I guess I'm the old man here.  I got in at single digits, actually spent a whole lot of bitcoin in support of the community - I remember paying a guy 3 or 4 btc for a digital download of his techno album.  I also kept buying and trading for a year or so, one of my favorite pass times was forcing margin calls on the weakhands.  I got into it for political reasons, Crypto-anarchism, and I've maintained my holdings for the same reason - also, the taxes for taking profit would be insane... when I get out of bitcoin, I'll have to not be a US citizen (unless the state gets it shit together).

Yes, it transfers wealth quite directly from the bottom to the top.  The wealthy have a lot more resources at their disposal to not only protect their wealth from government action, but to profit off of it.  Not even considering the much lower relative cost of accountants and financial advisors to the wealthy, there is regulation that expressly forbids nonwealthy people from participating in parts of the market: [Accredited investor](


lol, "using" it for what?  Blindly pumping it into the stock market in order to guard against said "encouraging" or wasting it on consumer crap because why the hell not?  If the Fed stopped inflating our currency then there would be a very perceivable change in our economy, but it would be a net positive in my estimation - though the Chinese manufacturers of rubber dog shit and McDonald's toys might disagree.


I've not mentioned government spending.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:25:51


US financial regulation and practices pretty much touch the lives of every living person on Earth.  I wish this were not the case, but it is.


I'd be very surprised to learn that this is actually true in practice.  On paper, with the structuring of tax brackets, it might appear true - but that isn't looking at the entire picture.  Consider the massive relative difference in burden between the wealthy and non-wealthy for the costs of essential products, all of which are subject to inflation.


Oh boy, are we about to discuss minimum wage laws?  First let us step back and see how far from the original topic we are: you asked what impact a world with only bitcoin would have, then you said that the problems I pointed out are only due to "government policy"... you know that bitcoin sidesteps "government policy" right?
