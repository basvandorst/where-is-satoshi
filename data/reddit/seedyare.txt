admittedly I haven't read all the replies, but its all great being able to buy/hold Bitcoin but there's no point in being sent Bitcoin unless there's some shops that are accepting? 
Wouldn't it be worthwhile finding and publicising these retail stores?

At the time of posting almost £5,000 ($8,400 / €6,000) has been donated of this 'worthless' currency!
Or are you referring to USD Fiat in which he will receive the donation in?

Even if you knew the identities of the hackers, North Korea doesn't extradite its own i'm sure.

China has a lot of wealth leaving their country in corrupt officials siphoning billions and fleeing to the west. 
Maybe this is why they are prohibiting BTC? Easy to move the money

Am I the only one cynical enough to think 'OP is a blatant employee of this place'
Edit: just checked out OP posting history and always in coin so doubtful is an employee.

I don't think its a theory, I think its a reality. 
There's rumour that a DDOS was used on Silk Road 2, along with the recaptcha image flaw. 
I wouldn't have been surprised if agencies tried anything and everything at their disposal to uncover the top tier of hidden services. 
(And after re-reading my earlier comment, wanted to say i'm infact pro-Tor and not anti-tor, unfortunately there's a lot of bad press about Tor rather than the better side of it..)

I think you need to ask in and the answer is probably every government agency tasked with Child Protective Services, Narcotics agency along with regular cops who need to protect against hitmen and fake ID's.. then there's just the botnet herders, skiddies, rival marketplace owners and others.
tldr; there's a number of people and agencies that would benefit from DDOS'ing Tor.
