I have no idea how to avoid having them, but avoiding posting them seems pretty simple IMO. Like, there's no one out there who wouldn't have bought bitcoin at 100$, knowing what we know now.

But the donation has nothing to do with basic income. It's just a handout to poor people.

Everyone in this thread: "**I regret not buying them when they were low so I could sell them now that they're high**"
Great comments guys, keep them coming.

40 extremely impoverished villages, right? That's still not UBI. UBI is giving money to everyone, rich and poor, not just the poor.

I assume you've tried recovering it? A format can be recovered.

The article has nothing to do with UBI. It's just a handout to poor people.

I'm not complaining about the people thinking bitcoin is going to continue rising, I'm complaining about the ones who come in here saying "Man I wish I had bought when they were 100$ so I could be a millionaire now" the comment is so pointless, and there's like at least 100 of them in this thread.

Interest. The more people who find bitcoin interesting, and believe that it's a superior currency, the more it will be worth. Demand, basically. And with loads of banks/exchanges/companies starting to support bitcoin, it's only going to grow bigger.

Where's a good place to do this? It seems overly complicated. I got a wallet at blockchain, then I need an account at a trading site, and an account at some unknown cashu site, to pay the trading site, and then transfer from trading site to wallet.. Isn't there a simpeler way then you live in europe?

No you haven't.

Any like that, but without having to meet and pay in person? I'm trying to avoid hassle, not create it Haha

There's not a single bitcoin seller in my country. And I'm not really a big fan of having to go to an atm, and then meet up with some guy somewhere.. I prefer the paypal/credit card way. There must be some site like wirvox.. but not wirvox.
