Coinbase Commerce is in fact P2P. The merchants hold their own private keys, and actually receive cryptocurrency rather than some sort of construction wherein the crypto is instantly exchanged for fiat.
Also, you don't need to have a Coinbase account to use Coinbase Commerce :)

There's also  - a Bitcoin Marketplace for digital goods. It launched last week but looks very promising.
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:29:53
You can add [Coinmall]( to that list :)
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:06:37
Expect something big to be announced within 24H :)
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:50:51
In a sense, yes. CoinMall is much more advanced (more features, scalable, more secure, built from the ground up) compared to Bitify (few features, built on Wordpress, high fees).

Hey there, this is a PoC to show how easy it is to buy a product on CoinMall. We took the whitepaper as an example :)
The bigger picture is that anyone can list any digital product on CoinMall, it's sort of a hybrid between Shopify and eBay.
Example: Let's say you've written an eBook and want to sell it for Bitcoin, you can conveniently do so through CoinMall. The marketplace isn't limited to eBooks either, you can sell pretty much any digital product that comes to mind. License codes, game keys, gift cards, software, pictures - you name it

Best case scenario: You're being used as a middleman in a money-laundering scheme and you make 10%, whilst taking all the risk/heat.
Worst case scenario: You're getting ripped off. Once you send the Bitcoin, the money sent to your bank account will be refunded to the 'associate/customer' and you'll have lost whatever the amount is you sent him in Bitcoin
Either way: Do not proceed. This is a scam.

IIRC blockchain.io was obtained by Paymium right before they did their ICO, so the lawsuit was because users confused the .io project with the .info/.com project. 
It's very likely Paymium was well aware of the possible (profitable) confusion that came with the domain name, but they decided to go ahead with it anyway.

- Why haven't you incorporated your business? I don't feel safe using a service which hasn't even incorporated.
- Why are you advertising on hacking forums? (quick Google search shows you are). I don't like the idea of selling digital goods with the risk of law enforcement shutting it down because hackers might have been selling illegal stuff on the same platform. Is this why you haven't registered the business?
- It seems like your previous domain was sellnow.io, what happened to it?
I might have used Rocketr if it wasn't for the above. I'll continue investigating.

Thanks for the explanation. It does make sense now that you've explained it.
I strongly urge you to incorporate as soon as you can since that's the first thing a seller looks at. I'd personally be much more inclined to register and start selling.
Good luck with your venture, I hope you and your partner succeed :)

Your coins are quite safe on Blockchain.info, just make sure to save the recovery phrase (can be found when logged in and going to: settings -&gt; security -&gt; wallet recovery phrase) in case anything ever goes wrong.
If and when 2X split occurs, you can cash out the 2X coins by deriving your private keys from the security phrase you backed up and sell the 2X coins if you wish to do so. I've personally done so with my Bitcoin Cash when that fork occurred.

The article the tweet refers to is actually pretty good advice. 
They're warning people of companies who abuse the current ICO hype to scam many people from their hard-earned money (and in a way, help legitimate ICO's and cryptocurrencies in general). +1 to SEC for this.
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:11:53
I had a similar issue when cashing out my bcash, perhaps I could help you with that. Alternatively you could wait for blockchain.info to implement bcash support (which is supposedly coming soon), but then you run the risk of bcash being massively dumped on exchanges, resulting in less money you could cash out.
-  - Look at the post by 'bitpump', it has 5 steps and will result in you obtaining your bcash :)

Yes, that's normal since Electrum uses/connects to servers which have the Bitcoin Blockchain indexed :)

Try to add HTTPS before the link. So: 
If it doesn't work, clear your cache and cookies and try again, the error should disappear if all is well.

Have you tried ViaBTC's transaction acceleration tool? It's free to use (but could be unavailable depending on the amount of requests they're getting).
Another option is using btc.com's pushtx, but I haven't tried that one personally.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:25:09
Seems resolved now :)
