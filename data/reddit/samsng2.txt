But it had a good reason to drop at thia time: the incoming fork  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:04:49
So why waiting for LN if block size increase can help Bitcoin now ?  
I mean since months we are waiting for LN as the miracilous solution. And this solution needs bigger blocks. Why waiting for LN to increase block size as it will be mandatory anyway ?  
  
The one he is talking about is LN  
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:30:08
If those coins move one day the market wish crash  
It means a million BTC will be suddently "not lost"  
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:12:25
Ok thanks I see better  
So actually there is one side of Bitcoin that believe everhthing should achieved on 1 layer (bch) and an other side who believe we need several layers to scale (btc)  
If its correct no need to answer me ;)  
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:10:11
Thanks a lot for this, I didn't know about most  
There are so many informations about bitcoin it's sometimes hard to really understand what's going on    
Have a nice day ;)  
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:45:50
Ahah nop thanks i had BTC for years as I told you  
Is it necessary to write useless comments and saying nothing interesting ?  
Because you wrote so far several comments saying nothing but trying to appear superior  
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:25:51
So what's the main reason in your opinion ?  
The difficulty to reach a conscensus within the Bitcoin ecosystem ?
  
About the downsides I guess you are talking about centralisation ?  
But i think about Moore's law then. What about it ?  
And anyway a block size increase will happen with LN as it is mandatory so what's the point of not doing it now ?  
I mean you criticize a block size increase (and its effects) and at the same time you praise a solution with a block size increase. That's what I dont understand  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:57
This lack of fungibility is a weakness for Bitcoin  
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:33:29
Ok my bad  
Thanks for the insight  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:36:38
Its going up too fast
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:25:06
I believe he doesnt have the priate keys any more and use those Bitcoin as a canary for the network  
If those coins move it mean Bitcoin is hacked
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:58:57
Thanks ;)  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:07:45
Is there a consensus about not increasing the block size ?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:31:07
+ a million BTC will suddently flow in the market and will not be lost anymore
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:26:48
No bigger blocks ;)  
"It does this by splitting the transaction into two segments, removing the unlocking signature ("witness" data) from the original portion and appending it as a separate structure at the end.[The original section would continue to hold the sender and receiver data, and the new "witness" structure would contain scripts and signatures. The original data segment would be counted normally, but the "witness" segment would, in effect, be counted as a quarter of its real size."
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:36:03
Ahah typical, i'm a r/btc guy now  
Actually no. But a Bitcoin user since a long time  
And I remember sending transactions within 10-30minutes with a maximum of 1$ fee  
But now ? I fixed 10$ fees, then increased my fee to 15$ and to 17$ to make through. It took me 24h as I was expecting each time it would have been processed. And i know how to read the mempool and calculate my fees  
And please, I want to learn so at least give me an insight about what I should learn/look for to understand why keeping 1mb blocks is the way to go  
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:04:48
I don't think off-chains transactionas are good according to the whitepaper  
The goal written in it is to allow people to don't use companies to transfer funds to each others because it works on a "trust" model  
If we use offchains transaction that's basically what we do, no ?  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:10:22
Honestly, who would make a donatipn if it cost them 10$ at least in fees ?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:46
This lack of fungibility is a weakness for Bitcoin  
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:56:20
There is no problem i have seen this "war" going on for a few months and I understand what you mean  
So don't worry it's fine.  
I guess that to understand more about the layers I should look further about the lightning network ?  
If you can just gibe me some names to google i would appreciate ;)  
 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:23:11
My personal point of view is that those BTC are like a canary  
We know the adresses, we know that Satoshi mined them.  
I believe he destroyed the keys to access to this wallet.  
So if one day those coins move it will mean that Bitcoin and its security has been hacked  
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:00:59
That's true  
Could you just quickly tell me why you tell me this ? I see what you mean but not how it applies to Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:33:46
I could also ask you why not using the blockchain for every dougnut ? Why not according to you ?  
  
It is 2 different visions of Bitcoin here  
  
I believe everything should be on the blockchain. Because without blockchain we are using the trust model and thus need to rely on private companies.  
Actually both ideas are good because they both help Bitcoin to be more useful. I just don't trust companies when it comes to "help Bitcoin working better"  
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:11:21
Thanks  
I already heard of those, definitly gonna give a look  
I'm quite lost now with the 2 ideologies of bitcoin  
Offchain transaction here and only chain transaction you know where  
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:20:09
The man gave you thre advice  
Successful coins are the one who work and are used by people  
The biggest users of cryptos were (and are?) deepweb markets  
And Monero is the ideal coin for it  
+ It's the only fungible crypto - which is an obligatory aspect for a currency
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:05:08
Anyway,  
Segwit is implemented for this very exact reason: to increase block weight and allow more transactions per block (thus lower transactions fees if the amount of transaction stays the same as now)  
Why this solution is good but not an increase in block max size ?  
You could argue it is because one needs an hard fork and not the second one  
That's true and it is so far the main reason I think  
  
And honestly, Bitcoin is so wide that I lack of knowledge on several aspects, so I would like you to tell me about which precise knowledges/aspects of Bitcoin you are talking about. I may need to educate myself more  
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:41:52
Even though I disagree with you for the 1st part because of:  
Miners centralisation and Moore's law, thanks for the second part.  
When you say we have 0.7mb block space we are not using, are you talking about block size we could save up with Segwit and schnorr signatures ? Or do you think about something else I missed ?  
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:25:23
Instead of telling me to educate myself like a r/imverysmart please give me some insights  
And don't put me in a case please, Im a Bitcoin user and I linke to debate on Reddit and think critically ,and when I think about Bitcoin I don't see how can 1mb blocks be a logical futur for Bitcoin  
As I told you I don't need r/btc to realize that the network can't be used nowadays as it was several months ago before the hype. Transaction time and fees (in satoshi/bytes) increased a lot, no need to have special skills to see it  
In your opinion the best solution (LN) requires the same technical changes as I'm talking about, so I don't understand why we disagree  
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:22:18
Honestly even thoigh i turn this problem in all the possible the ways I still don't understand how this is supposed to be a better thing than bigger blocks to allow very cheap and fast transactions  
  
I really don't see what's the selling point of LN when you could do without it ?  
  
Please enlight me guys, I'm somehow lost with why LN is a great thing for BTC  
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:07:36
Ok thanks i understand what you mean i have to admit it makes sens  
  
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:07:57
Its only a bus company  
  
Not that much a big company
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:51:35
Same here  
Edit: waited 8hours and it went ok
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:39:51
19€ of fees ???  
You wanted to be included in the next block I guess
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:34:33
There are for sure around 1 million of satochi's BTC when he mined. Otherwise the other number someone gave you are the numbers that are usually floating around
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:47:15
If you want the bus to catch 100k$ keep explaining nicely to people why it is the futur ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:44:18
Same here  
If the service isn't better i will give a try somewhere else and ifbit's better, move definitly from Kraken  
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:27:22
He starts to get really angry around 36:00
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:52:53
No i disagree  
You should explain to rhem what is blockchain, bitcoin and the crypto world  but rhen tell them to see by themselves what it truly is and decide if it worth a try   
If they are truly interested they will talk moreabout it to you and probably will do it on their own, if not they will not talk about it to you  
But at least moree people are aware of it  
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:26:39
Big if true
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:06:32
I think that 50,k$ per BTC at the top is reasonable in the ten next years
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:59:38
Hello guys  
I just wonder if most of the big miners don't mine Bitcoin anymore and suddently, what does it mean for Bitcoin ?  
Will it be able to properly work or blocks will take too much time to validate ?  
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:46:30
Please don't write such horror stories here  
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:22:50
Ah I didn't realized I changed my claim, my bad, that's what I had in mind since the beggining      
I thought it was supposed to make Bitcoin usable again as block size are the problem and limit tx/s thus increase fees  
I understood people were waiting for LN as the thing to solve bitcoin scalability. So if it isn't going to change that much, any idea of what is the good solution ? I really don't see anything else then the original idea of increasing block size each x blocks  
Even though SW and Schnor are good technologies I don't think it will solve anything if we keep 1mb blocks  
I want BTC to succeed but I don't understand why do we need a trust-nodel instead of the revolutionnary ability to exchange value without intermediaries 
 
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:28:11
Can't believe I see this  
Few weeks ago the mempool was always very busy
@_date: 2018-03-03 11:54:39
I mean, isn't LN praised as THE solution to solve BTC block size limit ?  (With Schnor and SW I agree but still)  
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:26:50
Just suscribed
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:29:51
I belive that a blockchain of a few Tb isn't a problem  
First 4Tb HDD are around 120$ - 130$ so it's not that expensive, especially if you are into BTC since a while  
Plus I dont think SW and Schnorr will solve the problem at all  
The best they can do is increasing the number of transaction, but can't even double it, so they aren't long term solution neither  
LN is a joke for anyone into Bitcoin for a while too. It's the total opposite of why BTC was created for - a trust model  
  
We both know that BTC usage was limitated because of it's fees and time for conformatipn, because blocks were full  
  
I don't see what else you can do rather that increase the block size to really improve BTC  
I'm not for a strong increase. But i like the Satoshi first idea- increasing blocksize every x blocks (+ Schnor and SW of course). According to Moore's law it should be fine  
  
Only relying on SW and schnor signature is not healthy for BTC. I belive we should increase block size little by little at the same time with SW and Scnor. Because the excuse of: let's not increase block size at all before we develop every other solution that might take years to achieve, is counter-productive to me because it still limits BTC possibilities a lot. And why not doing this instead of promoting the LN ? 
Edit: i just share my opinion and might be wrong on some aspects. Feel free to correct me
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:45:37
It looks so cool  
Well done ;)
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:18:32
It did, but not because of lack of interest  
Edit: no arguments back, so you downvote, classy
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:32:15
Ahh thanks ! ;)  
I don't have that much anyway :p  
I was just wondering that it must be quite complicated to cashout that much
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:48:27
Europe, why?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:15:59
"It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed," Dimon said  
The guy knows his subject... How do you even close Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:46:33
I guess that he didn't tink about ASIC miner at that time and thought that mining would be performed by CPU and GPU
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:46:54
You part of the club now :)  
Welcome :D
I would advise you to secure well your seed and do don't keep your wallet n your main computer. And use yoir wallet the less you can to avoid mistakes.  
You just have to hodl now and sell when you believe that you earn enough  
Good luck !  
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:48:14
Thanks for the link, it's interesting
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:30:55
Why would you say they are irrational ?  
And aren't blockstream arrogant too by claiming they have all the solutions ?   
Edit: at least reply me 
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:38:50
Kraken is Ok for that
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:50:50
Im thinking about the 4th  
If BCH keep going down I think it will be a good idea to buy some and to sellaround the fork  
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:19:38
Now how do you cashout in fiat 1 million $ of bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:26:29
Even though I agree withthis vision of Bitcoin I believe the Satoshi solution was better. Increasing block size every x blocks. Because we all know that block size limited the amount of transactipn and thus increased the fees and thus limited the usability of Bitcoin (i paid +15$ in fees for a 48h long transaction) and I know it makes many people reluctant 
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:29:14
I highly doubt that  
Most people on r/Bitcoin are uneducated about BCH and BTC   
You feel like there is a bigger commuity because it's what the noob go for, Bitcoin not Bitcoin Cash  
Edit: prove me wrong. Go in the street and ask for BTC and BCH and rhe sifferences. Everyone knows Bitcoin but not BCH or why it was created
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:03:19
Could develop a little bit please?  
Because of the halving of coins reward?
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:58:24
Quantum ?
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:44:00
Yes my bad, I didn't remembered this oart of the whitepaper
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:10:16
Satoshi also said many other things, especially about block size  
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:25:05
Looks like a good time to buy some alts
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:14:37
Yeah especially if you want to convince people to go into bitcoin you don't need donation, the value you hodl will increase by itself if they join
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:41:27
He it burst at ten years and keep increasing that way we are all good :)
