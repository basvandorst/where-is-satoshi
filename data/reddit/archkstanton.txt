I'm pretty interested to see what it's like to get a changetip.  Thanks and merry Christmas.

Yeah.  That's the one that was listed.  It looks liked they removed it sometime between April 18 and 25.

The ones I can think of are Celery, Circle, Snapcard, and LocalBitcoins.

I would check BitcoinAverage ( to check the lowest price on various exchanges.  The problem is the cost of getting USD into the exchange. Usually it's the cost of the wire transfer. 
As far as instant exchanges are concerned the cheapest would either be Coinbase or Circle, but you would most likely pay a markup because the risk the exchange is taking on.

I would guess $500. RemindMe! 4 months

You don't need a bank account for either of them, just a credit or debit card.
For Trucoin, you need to login to one of your social networking sites in order to verify your identity.

Nice to sell buying and selling integrated in Copay.  Does anyone know why BitPay doesn't directly sell Bitcoin to customers ala Coinbase, considering they must receive a lot of Bitcoin from merchants?

Unfortunately, we are still the point where companies are worried about getting sued, which makes KYC necessary.  The only way I know of to avoid that, yet still use a credit card, is to use some type of third party service, such as [Purse.io]( or [Brawker](
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:26:13
[Circle.com]( is probably the best way right now, however some credit cards do bill it as a cash advanace.  When I tried it, it went through as a normal credit card purchase.
[Trucoin]( is another option as well.  I haven't used them yet, but they are pretty reputable.  It only works in certain states though, so you would have to check before signing up.

They go through the effort of making it look legit and they spell it "BitCoin".  I don't understand.
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:21:02
Do you support USD?
@_date: 2015-10-28 00:03:17
Yeah. Your best option like someone said would be to try recovery software. 
When I demonstrate how Bitcoin works, I usually use a small amount less than $10 and let them keep it.

What service did you use to get your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:49:29
Is there anywhere to buy them with a credit card?
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:08:03
Just broke $250.

I like that design.  How can I get it as a hoodie?
