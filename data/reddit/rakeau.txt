I'm in the same situation: Looking to buy a few to hold indefinitely, and just wishing I got into it years ago!
If you're having trouble wrapping your head around the concept, a little tip: Try not to think about Bitcoin addresses. While you -can- re-use a single address to send and receive all your funds, it's a bad idea from a security and privacy perspective. You're meant to use a new address for every transaction.
So think of a wallet as being two things:
* As a concept, a 'wallet' is a collection of coins you receive. With a real wallet you put bank notes and coins inside, with a Bitcoin wallet, you put in the "data" pertaining to each coin. Or put another way, a wallet is like a bank statement. Every time you receive money, you add that transaction to your statement, as well as the details you need in order to spend it later (private key, public key, bitcoin address)
* As an implementation, a Wallet is a piece of software which performs the above functions:
-- It 'remembers' your transactions, as you make and receive them, and the relevant details so that they can be spent later
-- It can sign transactions when you want to spend/transfer Bitcoin and send that to the network
-- It can generate new addresses for you to give out in order to receive bitcoin.
In a sense, using a Bitcoin wallet is sort of like running a business. When a business wants to get paid for providing a good or service, they generate an invoice with a unique number, which you send off for that person to pay, and then records and tracks it. Likewise, a Bitcoin wallet generates an address for each receiving transaction, records and tracks it. The only place this data exists is within your wallet, hence being so important to back it up and guard it.
Once I wrapped my head around this concept, it made understanding and using it simpler. Though I'm still learning tbh!

The only similarity I see here is that OPEC and the many of the major miners are effectively cartels. BU loves harping on about how they're being true to Satoshi's words, citing the Bitcoin whitepaper as their gospel, but I doubt the intention was ever for a few select individuals or coordinated pools to control such huge percentages of hashpower. Yet here are these people funnelling huge money to have as much hash power as possible. and banding together to ensure as much dominance over the network as possible.

It suggests you can? &gt;&gt;

Also getting this. Reverting to 2.9.3 for now.

What I want to know is, given that SegWit inherently makes AsicBoost ineffective (and thus why these people are opposing it), are their proposals of BU and Flexible Transactions "compatible" with AsicBoost?

Yeah, saw that, but my complaint about the speaker still stands ;D
Thanks tho!

Completely unwatchable. Even at 0.75, 0.5 playback, it's a slur and I'm at a complete loss as to what he's talking about.
