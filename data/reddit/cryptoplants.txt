Haha, I agree! I did a week or so ago, and just asked if she had heard about it. She said no, and then I said I would bring her a reference to read up on it.
I've been hiding from her since then...

Another thought: It might benefit the wider acceptance of the currency if we started socializing the value in terms of 0.001 BTC ("mbit", or what have you).
This is closer to the value of 1 USD (at the moment). Using this denomination would be much easier to communicate, as a person wouldn't have to multiply or divide an amount by 1000 on the fly to get a sense of how much value they are sending or receiving.
If you're bullish on BTC, you might agree that it is inevitable that most transactions will not be in the value of whole bitcoins (thousands of USD). Given that optimistic viewpoint, why not start referencing the smaller denominations of BTC now?

Ah, I see. I should pay more attention to the other exchanges!

It almost seems as if The LA Times has an agenda by trashing Bitcoin. Are they hoping that it goes away? lol
