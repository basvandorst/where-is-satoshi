- redditor for 0 days - post about P2P pooling
To be honest this doesn't sound smart, I'd rather trust a single post by bitcoin expert, than 10 posts by a single user making multiple accounts.

it's been like this for 4 or 5 years now, it's (one of the thousands) anti tax evasion law.
recently they proposed to lower the limit to 500€, but it wasn't accepted.

8 out of (77+8+8+8-77/77) is exactly 8%! 
it's because of the math!

yes, at the moment you can't even pay with cash if the amount is &gt;=1000€

I'm not sure if this is related, but consider the fact that in Italy, for EVERY transaction &gt;=1000€, the government has a way to check your identity.
So if for example you go buy clothes  for 1500€, you can't pay with cash, but you have to use wire transfer, credit card, or whatever proves your identity, and the seller's identity.

The 2nd point of the amendment says that for transactions bigger than 1000€ (~1.4 BTC) you have to prove the identity of the owner of the sender's wallet.
The 3rd point says that in 6 months (if the laws becomes effective), there will be a meeting between the Ministry of Economy and Finances and Banca d'Italia (the central bank of Italy, part of the European system of central banks) to define the methods of identity verification.......
Good luck Italy! (and I'm italian)

Can someone care to explain why this comment is so downvoted? 
I'm fairly new and I'd like to understand.
