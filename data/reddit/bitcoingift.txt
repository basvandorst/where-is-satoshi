Thank you! Opendime looks interesting. Although I only see in packs of three, maybe I can look into this later. Paper wallet may be the best for now. I think he'll be more excited at the Bitcoin than how to store them at first :)

Thank you! That's a very good idea for him until he learns more :)

My son is just 13 and has been talking about Bitcoin for a while now and ever since last week when it has been in the news so much, I would like to get him some as a Christmas gift. I'd like to get him excited and in the habit of practicing good finance early on. Of course I hope it will do well and turn out to be a good investment for him, but also I'd like to give him something he would be the most excited for.
I've done alot of research but still I have just a few questions.
- The wallet should be store locally? Is there a certain kind of hard drive I should use? Is SSD safer? I don't want him to lose it to a failure. I would like to use Coinbase to buy and then transfer it if possible.
- How much should I worry about fees? I don't have much of a budget for this and I have seen some posts talking about fees eating a lot of bitcoin. I can only budget $25 for this and I've seen posts talking about $17 fees. Is that for larger transactions only? I see lots of talk about fees changing depending on platform.
Thank you for any help I receive. This forum has been extremely good to learn this to make the best decision.
