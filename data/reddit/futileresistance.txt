From their AMA, they explained that they'll most likely use Moolah.io to handle transactions, as Moolah is already meeting finCEN compliance.

That sounds fun! If no one here is interested, make a post on the dogecoin subreddit with more info. They'd totally sponsor you over there.

I think they're going to be doing a post and an AMA on the dogecoin subreddit today. Hopefully we can see some videos/images of the actual working ATM.

Hopefully something like Outernet works out. Pretty sure Google was working on something similar, can't remember what it was called though.

It's because people pay $20 for .01 btc, say they never recieve it, get their money back and keep the btc. If ebay could offer escrow it would be fantastic.

They probably use standard ACH payments to transfer money between banks. So yeah, always at least 3 days minimum.

A cooperative advertising effort would be really interesting. Maybe the foundations can work together.

Super majority is a term for more than 50%. Passing a constitutional amendment in the US requires a super majority for example (2/3rds of congress or 3/4 states).

What about decentralized exchange tokens that pay 50% of the fees on the exchange to token holders? If the exchange grows you get higher payouts.
One DEX that does that is cryptobridge, but there may be quite a few that follow that model in the future.
I'd like to see decentralized marketplaces adopt something similar too. Create a token and have a small fee on sales that gets distributed to token holders, it seems like a good way to generate a grassroots advertisement system into a decentralized organization.
