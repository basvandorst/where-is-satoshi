The goal exchange rate for Bircoin is a wise and old question. Alas, winds whisper of prophecy, as foretold by an ancient seer of days hence past.
What is this prophecy say you? It was but low moon on this calm and starry night, whilst children slumber and wives slept tight. The seer gazed up at the stars shining bright, HODLing tight those Bitcoin he bought. Something happened and thus he thought; of how the corn could fly so high, then from this he wondered why; and from such a prophecy born. “$1m BTC else penis be torn.”.

Chill. It’s not a Ponzi scheme; it’s a tax evasion scheme.

Wish I had the time to type such a long post, then I wouldn’t waste it for persuading others of my beliefs on reddit either way.
