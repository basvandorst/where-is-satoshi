AsicMiner is deploying a planned total of 200TH in the coming month. In the meantime, people are throwing money to them in order to get their Erupter Blades and USB Mining sticks. Don't forget that all those advance bitcoins add up to the dividends, too.
They are very good at delivering what they promise and are the biggest innovators in the bitcoin mining industry. Timing your securities buys and sells is important, and of course it is a risky environment, as everything in bitcoinland is. AsicMiner business model is a race against the clock, obviously (and they know it), but I wouldn't call investing in them "retarded".
But of course a) I am a shareholder, b) I bought my shares at 60% of their current price and c) I am a naturally enthusiastic person :D

Even if he doesn't know a thing about bitcoin, in this particular case your dad is right.
There is a queue of ~15,000 people waiting to receive their Butterfly Labs device before you. BFL have proven to be totally unreliable in keeping their word and schedule, and by the time (if ever) you get your miner, it will be late to turn a profit. 
At this point, in my opinion is way safer to buy [ASICMiner shares]( Here's an old saying for when you explain this to your old man: *"In a gold rush, some people dig for gold, and some people sell shovels."* ASICMiner being the proverbial shovel merchants.
The share price will probably go up in the medium term, and you will see your investment appreciate in the coming months. Set a target ROI and then sell your shares back. In the meantime, you will collect dividends from the company's earnings (both sales and mining).
Keep in mind that bitcoin mining is a race against the clock for everyone involved -no matter how big- and at some point in the future your shares will be worthless. Stay up to date, read the forums, question every opinion, be an informed man. Timing and a cool head are everything in Bitcoinland.
And of course 1) don't invest more than you can afford to lose and 2) never, ever take financial advice from strangers on the Internet ;)
EDIT: clarity.

Think of it as if they have negative value. You will spend bitcoins that you'll never get back. Buying 0.5 BTC today is a better investment than buying one of these.

Yes, but it is also a matter of *perceived* ease, advantages and risks. You're fighting against the establishment. My dad (for example) already knows how the world banking system works and accepts its associated risks because banking is mainstream and everybody already sees the whole picture. Similarly, I see myself teaching my dad to use Paypal and explaining in detail how it works.
Of course, Paypal and the banking system are incredibly complex systems but their ***interfaces*** are standard, proven and have been progressively refined and optimized for the general public during more than a decade. There's a carefully woven veil isolating the tool from its noise. If that makes any sense.
I mean, we redditors don't usually see this but... for the average person even getting to use Reddit feels obscure, complex and intimidating the first times, compared to -let's say- using a smartphone. Now try to explain how Bitcoin works, how to stay up to date in the Bitcoin world of today to a 60 year-old!

When the *sabotage* as you're calling it nets you money, the logical thing to do is to run some calculations and try to figure out what's best for your company in terms of income.
Mt.Gox has had plenty of time to put a leash on the bots. It hasn't, nor has it ever showed any public interest in doing so. Conclusion: they have ran the calculations and the bots stay. 
If you don't like it, don't use Mt.Gox. The fact that you're still using their platform is solid proof that their strategy is working.

There are a few things missing in your brief.
* Measures of the final banner (in pixels)
* Whether it should be pure imagery (such as a background) or have words in it. If that's the case, what words.
* Some style hints. Photography? Collage? Illustration? If you can't think of anything, try to focus instead in what you *don't* want, and state it.
* a rough idea on what the new design will be like (you want something that blends in and complements your website design, not an out-of-place, alien item floating around)
* a deadline
Also, 1 bitcoin is probably a low bounty if you're looking for something good and unique. An experienced freelance designer hourly rate is around $40/hr. You're asking for creative work, not some run-off-the-mill cheesy Flash banner. Doing good creative work requires not only "Photoshop time" but a good deal of thinking, trial and error, time spent communicating with your client, etcetera. You usually get what you pay for.

I've been thinking about buying Asicminer-pt shares too, but a quick calculation (based on the latest dividends) averages some 8-10 months until ROI. Then again, it is possible that the recent speedy developments in the Bitcoin world have made me an impatient investor. I think Asicminer's operating model is really interesting, but the current price of 0.7 BTC per share seems a bit too high for such a slow return.
Care to shed some light on my short-sightedness? What are your reasons to think that buying shares will be a sound investment in the long term?

I love bullet points so there it goes: 
* Only ~0.015 of this week's dividend is from mining. The other ~0.023 is from hardware sells.
* ASICMiner has now about ~22% of the network hashing power. Using your own logic, there's still about 2x space to grow.
* Even if some of the competition comes online this summer (Avalon, BFL, 100TH), there's still about 180TH to be deployed in order to keep the mining power steady.
* ASICMiner is currently working on 2nd generation ASIC chips, and (at least at the moment) they have a flawless technical and operational record.
I'm not saying they're the business to end all business, but they have proven (and excelled) themselves on every chance they've had. Every other player in this field still has, by comparison, a lot to prove.

My $0.02:
1. Even with AsicMiner being a BTC-based enterprise, they need to pay for electricity, equipment, salaries, maintenance and new hardware in fiat. A low usdbtc ratio is bad for their cash flow.
2. A crash scares shareholders, too. In times of great instability, you need to be nimble in order to minimize losses. The securities market is illiquid, meaning that you can't buy and sell quickly and you are very vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market. Some AsicMiner shareholders have decided to realize what gains they had and grab some BTC in hand. And some of them will cash out in $ while BTC is around $90-100.

Every BTCT.co ASICMiner share ownership is backed up by a contract between [Burnside]( (BTCT's owner and passthrough operator) and Friedcat (ASICMiner's CEO). If the exchange closes, Burnside will send Friedcat a list with your username, e-mail and Bitcoin address in order for you to get your dividends directly as a direct shareholder.
At least that's what's supposed to happen. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

You should't invest in anything more than you can't afford to lose. 
It's OK to be bullish about bitcoin but, as of today, thinking that your money is safer in BTC than in a bank is delusional. You can get burned badly. 
Rule of thumb: if you're losing even one hour of sleep on an investment, you're too exposed.

Sure! I hope you're right, there needs to be more competition. Mt.Gox are too big to fall right now.
But still the only reason why Mt.Gox is bot's paradise is because it's popular, hence there's liquidity, hence it offers the best potential returns. If Buttercoin prospers and gets half as popular as Mt.Gox is today, you can bet the bots will start moving there too.
And correct me if I'm wrong but an open source trading engine offers an excellent chance for trading bot developers to fine-tune their little beasts...

I'm no newbie to Bitcoin, but I'm just starting to wrap my head around ASICminer and mining shares in general. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but at the current pps of G.ASICMINER-PT and dividend [average]( (~0.05 BTC per share per month) it will be about 7-8 months until you start recouping your investment. Isn't that a bit... slow? I mean, of course BTC could go up, but then again they're offering 400,000 shares. More shares means less dividends for everybody, and with Avalon/BFL ASICs hitting the market in the next months, the BTC mining capability of ASICMINER-PT will sharply decrease. It just doesn't look very promising at a first glance.
What I'm I missing? Thanks in advance.

The previous dividend was ~0.036 btc/share. The next dividend is expected to be about ~0.013 btc/share. You can check what the expected dividend is [here](
Also, there's a probable extra profit from selling some USB miners that are [already shipping]( (an extra 0.0025 btc/share).
In my opinion, AsicMiner is going to be much more than the sum of its mining potential. But then again, I'm a shareholder.

Optimistic as I am, the ingredients for Bitcoin to go mainstream are still far from present. The process of buying/selling is zero straightforward for the newcomer or non tech-savvy user.
And 90% of the people doesn't even know what Wordpress is. The day Amazon accepts Bitcoin, that's mainstream. The day you can trade/buy/sell Bitcoins as easily as you use Paypal or your bank account, that's mainstream. The day my dad comes and tells me about Bitcoin... you get the idea.

I've met with two distinctly different attitudes from women whom I've talked about Bitcoin.
- "I don't get it, it's a scam, I work a LOT to earn my [fiat]. You're playing with fire and will get burned."
- "Sounds interesting, I will look into it." (buys BTC 48 hrs later)
