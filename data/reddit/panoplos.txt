Hope you get your funds recovered. I am so glad I avoided CEX.io last year after reading several bad reviews. Why are so many British organizations so dodgy?

“alien citizen”?! You mean non-US citizen? If this is what you mean, then I am thoroughly confused why you think someone who is not a US citizen and doesn’t reside in the US could possibly be taxed by them. If you mean that you are a US citizen living abroad, then it is a different story.

There more I hear of Wall Street “analysts” calling for massive multiples on BTC in such short time, the more I think they are shorting the futures.

His name is actually James Altucher, and he is not 18.
But yes, he’s now a “genius” on the subject after buying Bitcoin on CoinBase late 2017...

Super job!! Someone with an actual product in crypto and making money from it without an ICO. Rare, indeed.

Everything at once because on a lot of the high-volume exchanges most alts are priced in terms of BTC/ETH/XRP, etc. People get anxious about the whole lot when they see the leaders dropping hard.

Funny you say that because it was genetic algorithm driven probabilistic models that I have running that drew my attention to USDT oddities.

He says that users of the system should heed "buyer beware" and "not depend on the government to protect them." So, does this mean he agrees to social mob rule and would not take issue with the mob exacting their revenge on the nefarious actors in the form of the guillotine?
Ultra libertarians/anarcho-capitalists  are idealistic until it is their own personal livelihood or even lives on the line. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:01
Well, I noticed odd patterns in USDT trading few days ago, so decided to liquidate 90% of holdings into fiat just in case. Most likely lucky, but the concern is real.

Cramer also said Lehman Brothers was a safe investment before they went BK.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:30:04
This is spot on and something I have been trying to educate people with little knowledge of formal economics about. The key word, which you left out, is elasticity. No growth economy (which the global economy is) can rely on a deflationary, inelastic currency; thus the shift away from gold-backed money to fiat. That being said, Bitcoin is an ideal store of value, much more so than gold due to its trust-less, distributed and secure nature. If you cite valuation swings as an issue, gold has had similar swings throughout history. Bitcoin is still coming of age, and there is a lot of money to be made by manipulating sentiment around it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:30:56
It certainly occurs, but look at economic growth and poverty rates since dropping the gold standard and the implementation of standard property rights and collateral. The change is significant. Again, read the book.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:59:49
The only problem I am seeing is that everyone has this thinking during the crypto boom, and now everyone and their dog are selling picks and shovels with very few actually prospecting. Just go to any blockchain meetup and you will see 80% of the people attending are in the blockchain “services” industry, consulting for or managing ICOs, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:26:02

Guy needs to change his name to Peter Shaft, because that is what he has been doing to his "investors". Guy's a moron.
"The seller of the house immediately converted the Bitcoins to dollars."
How can you come away from that with the conclusion the transaction didn't happen in BTC? If you buy a house with gold and the seller immediately turns around and converts the gold to Rubles, it still means you bought the house with gold. This level of illogic should make *all* his "investors" redeem what money they have left with him right now!
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:58:46
Guy looks and speaks like a Floridian. Intellectual midget with little actual education underpinning his passion. Should lay off the coke, too.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:33:34
Most likely an exchange bug in their wallet management code.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:49:55
Well, if the bug is serious, it could mean that exchange will go bankrupt—someone could just exploit it and empty their wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:20:14
Downvoted for misleading title.

At this point at these these clowns are colluding to create more forks as they know the market will value the forks to some degree and ramp the original even more. It is the new Central Bank money printing scam.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:39:21
No. They have wallets with enormous amounts of BTC that they transfer from, so a bug in the code could have allowed you to double spend, for instance if you did so before their preferred confirmation level. Which exchange, and what was the exact procedure?
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:05:05
If the second tx exhausts your BTC, and the first transaction is well low in the stack of transactions, it’s possible.

No, he chases candles, then prays to God when it crashes against him to recover. He said his problem was that he was greedy by not taking gains, when in reality he was emotional and mentally frozen so he couldn’t cut his losses when they were small.
Do the math, no matter what your winning trade %, if you hold all your losses to 90%, your account will trend to $0.

First thing I do when I am wake up in the morning is check the price of the USD—
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:27:38
Wrong. It is the fact that people realize that idiots will buy the forked coin. It is essentially free money.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:52:55
With Segwit, people witnessed the market valuing BCH up to $1K. With so much more of the industry backing 2X, people are anticipating it will also carry a high value. The Bitcoin whales are playing this game well—enriching themselves on the idiocy of the masses.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:32:29
Sorry, but that is ugly!
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:58:24
Do the math. If S2X is valued at half of BTC, you are making money even if BTC falls 49%, which is unlikely given there is still a strong backing by the BTC camp.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:46:27
Means Mercatox wallet code is fucked, and yes you got someone else’s bitcoin, but the exchange own some of it, so most likely they will just eat the cost.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:03:31
No, I am saying the opposite.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:51:06
That is the sun (日), and the moon (月) on the left.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:18:31
In this scenario, you own both coins. People are referencing the Segwit split, which was free money.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:09:51
Woz is talking about Bitcoin and blockchain in general, not about ICOs. This guy is right, most will blow up, and I still cannot believe that people buying them call themselves “investors.”
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:02:54
This is exactly what they want, and you are all fools if you think differently. They got just enough people to “support” S2X that was necessary for “the market” to put a high value on the forked coin, essentially minting free money for themselves as idiots buy their shitcoins from them. Why is BCH still &gt;$300 (hit $1K at one point), yet no real service anywhere actually accepts it. It is all a ruse and you are all rubes for playing into it. Call a spade a spade and a crook a crook. Wall Street’s got nothing on these guys...
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:16:20
Yeah, instead this community is rewarding people who spent a week or two on a white paper with tens to hundreds of millions in free money (no obligations attached).
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:59:12
Which is exactly what is happening right now in ICO land. I think this article is more about ICOs than anything.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:57:44
Yeah, I read that as an explanation of ICO tokens.
