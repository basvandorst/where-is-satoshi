am I understanding it right and we'll be able to integrate all of these mechanisms into Bitcoin and take advantage of all of them without leaving anything out? I guess it's a more of a technical question rather than whether or not it will actually happen

dis dude is telling me to not check prices for a MONTH! I barely go for an hour without checking
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:45:26
what is the difference between LN and SegWit? or are they both parts of the same mechanism?
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:12:29
your best course of action is to spend a day looking into different coins and make a decision yourself. Don't listen to anyone 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:44:31
where do you watch stuff like that?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:30:20
ok so I'm trying to do that and I got to the point where it says I need to create a LN channel to buy a Blockaccino. What's my next step? How do I create a channel?

so what about opening an offshore account for these purposes? I know nothing about it but from what I see in the news, it seems to be the most popular way to get your money untaxed. 
just thinking out loud

My prayers go to people who bought their first bitcoin/satoshi at $19k and sold at $9.5k out of panic during the dip
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:11:37
I'm still very ignorant of all these technologies and starting to learn - are all of these different options it's a pick your poison kind of a deal or can they be put together to create a single efficient layer for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:40:25
can someone please ELI5 what this means for us (bitcoin users)?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:37
I second this. Any idea what it's going to take to run a node?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:39:24
can you please elaborate on the tax aspect?  I'm pretty new to btc. Am I going to have to file my btc purchases in the tax declaration?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:13:08
Thanks for explaining! Might be a dumb question but are they tracking btc wallets to ensure taxation or how does it work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:24
Houston, we are going down!

I hope no person invests in anything (not just crypto) to the point where suicidal thoughts might start making sense.  If you or anyone you know throwing everything they have into bitcoin, please talk some sense into them and advise against such investment.
the "don't invest recklessly" post is there for a reason

If it blows on the 10th, I'm buying in at low. bitcoin is too young to fail if it ever fails
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:34:28
Thanks for the elaborated answer! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:15:59
so, trying to bring it down to the fiat level
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:55
What a fucking rollercoaster!! HODLLLL
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:47:56
It wasn't addressed to you actually, sorry if it sounded so. It was just a thought out loud
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:30:35
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:41:13
I'm being torn apart between buying in today and waiting until the 10th/18th to see if it dips and then buy low
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:10:32
If I bought in at $2 and 2 months later got out at $2 (in other words, no gain/loss) - do I still have to pay tax?
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:31:28
lol you guys are crazy
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:57:28
couldn't put it in a better way
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:27:02
Didn't laugh about that comment while laughing at some meme
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:43:39
do you have a website?
