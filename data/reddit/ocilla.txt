I see, so when will it be fully implemented, is it even close??
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:17:56
I keep seeing good news about lightning network and now this but the price keeps going down lol what gives?
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:01:35
At least it almost brings us back to using the Vegeta memes, almost there 9k����
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:15:13
So what does this mean for bitcoin? I keep seeing these posts about lightning network testnet/mainnet. Can someone explain how it will help bitcoin and why so many people are eagerly awaiting it please?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:28:53
Agree 100%, what the hell is going on with these people acting like they don’t have brains of their own
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:38:55
So what, this is just wallstreets game now with this futures bs and bitcoin will never go back up past 20K because of the rich elite??
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:44:46
Robinhood is great, i use it for stocks and will also use it for crypto when available.
If anyone needs a Robinhood promo code for a free stock during sign up, message me!

This is HUGE! Hopefully we see a bullrun soon����

Now i can finally order hookers using bitcoin!����
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:16:31
Well no argument there lol i just meant in terms of electricity, internet and public transport. That type of thing is not included in taxes but for infrastructure and roads, tax is needed. Also, just for the record i think that the health bill pays OVER 100% of the cost associated with treatment considering they charge over a thousand dollars for just a bag of IV and a few hours of stay in a bed lol a lot of those “treatments” are a robbery.��
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:00:09
You guys seriously think btc will crash 80% even with the adoption rate we have today and all these institutions jumping on board? That’s crazy, no way that would happen but if you’re scared then sell now. Someone else will buy the btc you sold.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:22:01
True that bro����

you can say that about anything in life, there will always be more....
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:19:15
There will never be “only sellers”...the lower it gets, the more people jump in that were sitting and waiting on the sidelines for a price drop.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:16
Ya you should sell now, someone else will buy everything you’re willing to sell��

Approximately when will Lightning Network be fully implemented?
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:00:33
He pays for electricity, internet, healthcare, and public transport outside of income taxes...it’s not like those things are free just because people pay taxes.

@_date: 2017-12-09 07:32:08
Don’t worry about it man, you’ll learn more as you invest more. It could’ve been much worse, some people lose over 10 BTC to rookie mistakes, you’ll be fine!

Keep it on coinbase or GDAX.

Welp, i guess someone is going to end up eating their left nut��
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:47:22
Exactly, everyone saying  to not keep them on Coinbase does not know what they are talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:01:16
Anything can happen, what do you think will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:02:59
Get lost kid, just sell your BTC and buy BCH. Go lose your money clown.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:45:55
There is nothing wrong with keeping your coins on coinbase, they will split them for you.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:25:27
It already does? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:38:00
Did you forget i can see your history also? “Adidas ultra boost”, “4chan”, come out the closet already kid.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:40:26
You think BCH is gonna overtake BTC? Hilarious, you should do stand up.������
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:03
I love it, BTC to the mooon! Lol i took your guys advice and bought when it was about $4200 and HODLed, you guys are the best, cheers!
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:26:18
Thanks, i was just wondering if i sell it on Bittrex though, that’s the exchange i use. I don’t use or understand nodes/full nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:13:42
Lmfaoo i’ve been thinking the same thing all day. HODL strong, BTC will overcome!!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:01:20
Yeah you’re right kid, you should just sell your $100 worth of BTC now so you can take the optimum amount of profit. You’re mommy won’t give you any allowance for another week, Sean. Cash out so that you can have money for video games, 4chan boy.
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:22:23
And same goes for if you have your coins on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:47:20
How do you short a cryptocurrency? Genuine question btw lol i want to try it
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:52:18
I bet 8K before S2X fork
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:24:54
Don’t worry, the vets aren’t selling. They now better. HODL!!

Anyone know what cryptos will be supported by the crypto-fiat pairing on Binance?
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:18:03
The sun �� 
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:47:48
What do you mean? It’s an upgrade that many people have been waiting for so you would think it would drive the price up a bit
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:30:41
I believe they used to be except in the last few months that changed. It can go back to being that way though but who knows.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:21:10
I know that...it’s new to coinbase, the biggest exchange of them all. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:01:40
Any word on when it will be fully implemented?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:15:01
Wait, this is a serious post? you said you were “only able to achieve” a 35-40% loss lmao i thought it was sarcasm because i would not consider that an achievement...but congrats?
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:22:17
Anyone know specifically what cryptos will be  crypto-fiat pairings will be supported by Binance?
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:49:59
Lmao thanks man, what was that for?��
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:14:41
I’m not new and none of what you said is true.
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:03:59
What is Bakkt? I keep seeing this and was wondering.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:02:00
Well, they don’t explicitly say “exchanging of one virtual currencies to another” because the word “exchange” sums that up, so they can just say “exchange of virtual currencies” because that implies the same thing lol but i can understand your perspective also.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:59:40
I’ll either sink with the ship or go to the moon with the rocket, but until then i will hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:13:09
You don’t need to prove anything and you don’t care about what people on Reddit think. You can say anything or be anyone on the internet. You can even make up a pointless lie about shorting bitcoin to make money off of people who are hodling to make yourself feel better. Guess what...nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:21:56
I see, yes finally a logical answer lol. I would def buy more btc before the HF. That makes sense����
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:18:21
What is Bakkt? Been out of the loop for awhile
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:10:40
Is this an inside joke on this subreddit?? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:32:18
Nice, i agree lol hopefully LN gets released soon and helps it shoot up
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:35:24
If you don't like the question then don't answer it you douche. Kick rocks.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:00:38
Can someone ELI5 Segwit please?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:34:36
Yes, but what i’m trying to say is i think we should be higher than 4 weeks ago.  What has to happen to make it shoot back up? I’m asking for everyone’s opinion btw, just want to have a discussion about it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:36:50
I would also love to be proven wrong and i am not by any means trying to promote taxation of switch protocols but “exchanging of virtual currencies” literally means changing one crypto for another, hence the word “exchange”.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:17:22
What do you guys think, bull run incoming or not?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:22:46
Yeah right...you shorted bitcoin and you’re profiting off it. And i’m guessing you can’t provide us with any proof of this claim, right?����
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:04
I know there have been dips like before but were you expecting this much? I’m honestly asking and i will keep hodling and sink with the ship if i have to. It just seemed like everything was going good and then this happend lol
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:50:46
Me too, when are you guys going to move your BYC to coinbase??
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:43:24
What will happen to my BTC in November? Will it increase or decrease in value?
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:41:03
Lol unlimited ammo?
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:11:53
You really took the time to make such a long and dumb post like that? You got took much free time, my man.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:11:07
How about a hardware wallet? You can keep using the same address without risk right??
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:08:25
I agree but i’m just not sure if the IRS does lol greedy bastards.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:05:06
No, they do not.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:28:36
Too late man lol fork happend earlier than planned
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:19:37
Thanks for nothing tool����
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:04:03
Same. If the ship sinks, it will take me down with it. If it flys to the moon, it will take me with it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:03:59
No, you sure did not. That does not answer the question that was asked. "In a wallet" is not an exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:09:28
Lol you do? You sound like a child to me. i need to do something? Learn the concept of answering a question, you know, like a normal person.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:41:19
No, you clearly did not, you dipshit. That's why you keep insisting that he put his money in a wallet, even though that was never the question. Well, now you do know that putting your coins in an exchange is not a bad thing. If you want to know more just feel free to ask, my advice is free.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:15:47
I was wondering the same thing lol some people say that it’s not even in beta testing yet and others say it works fine and is already on mainnet. I don’t think they know what they are talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:00:55
Lol but i got the BCH coins during that hardfork while the coins were on bittrex. I guess what i'm asking is if i leave BTC on bittrex or coinbase, will i get the free coins?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:59:13
I need to read at a different speed? Lmao nice comeback, you told me to read at a different speed after i told you to read at a different speed. You're second comment makes absolutely no sense, "your talk of school says a lot more about your distance from it than me" also, your grammar tells a different story....what a dipshit, kick rocks kid��
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:02:58
Lmao i was about to say the same...”south korea confirmed they will not ban cryptocurrency” we got it the first 10 times this was posted.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:19:47
Nah i don't think so, i think you're just naturally a dumb-ass. You don't have to try too hard to "talk at me" like a dumb-ass.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:32:50
I was thinking the same thing
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:03:55
Also littered with a bunch of dumbasses who tried to "control their private keys" and lost their seeds or still had no idea what they were doing. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:40:31
Do you still get the free coins if it's on a wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:21:09
What a dumb comment...how would people adapt then, to make bitcoin popular and accepted? If someone has a question, you should try to give an answer, like a normal human.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:19:04
I heard you? Meaning what....
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:40:19
I like Bittrex
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:30:47
I have this same question.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:33:46
It says that it will pay the BGOLD dividend but then it goes on to say that it will "do it's best" to make a wallet for BGOLD i believe. So is it setup to pay the BGOLD dividend immediately or no??
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:05:10
Lol terrible ass community. Just criticizes people instead of trying to help right?
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:03:37
Lol what? Rain does not directly effect cryptocurrency...that was a bad correlation. Segwit implemented on coinbase SHOULD have had a positive impact but i guess it’s too late.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:17:49
I'm also curious about this.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:43:54
Now you’re changing your statement about shorting....I care about your lie?? Lol you wish
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:49:09
I think GDAX will do it if Coinbase does it, same company.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:08:47
This is not necessarily true... i bad BTC stored on Bittrex and got credited with BCH right away during the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:35:51
No, you did not give an answer,.The question was what exchange is best to use? All you did is insist he control his private keys and put it on a wallet. A wallet is not an exchange, so you did not answer the question. Lol i just don't get people like you. You should try to give helpful information to make people understand bitcoin so they can adopt it. If they don't the price won't keep going up, but you already knew that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:03:41
Once again,...and read this slowly....You told him to keep it "in a wallet" you didn't tell him what exchange to keep it in, as was asked. You did not answer the question. I'm guessing you struggled a lot in school.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:28:28
Ohh ok thanks for that, yeah i will move to a hardware/paper wallet soon but i haven't done it yet. It gets annoying when the answer to any question is "don't leave your coins on an exchange" haha.I left my BTC on bittrex during the august fork and received my BCH dividends immediately so it is situationly useful.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:14:48
Better question...where were all YOU clowns when BTC was at 20K??��
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:18:54
Ohh i see, lol sounds tough. Thanks for the write up.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:31:16
Lol BTC dammit
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:12:14
You might get it from coinbase we have to wait and see. It won't be anytime soon though, maybe in january or later.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:08:34
Thanks guys
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:34:50
What are some of the ridiculous laws? Lol i’m genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:29:48
At least i know that storing my bitcoin on an exchange is not a bad thing as long as you know what you're doing and how to take the right security measures. You're a dumb-ass though, so you'd end up doing it wrong and getting hacked.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:18:20
Haha no problem. so like electrum, trezor, or a paper wallet that supports it? But isn't it too late to do that??
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:07:36
Bitcoin cash network??
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:10:01
...Or you could've just gave a simple answer instead of wasting time on a comment like that.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:49:19
What do you guys mean by "backup" like just writing down your private keys in multiple safe places??
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:05:08
Lol thanks man, BGD sounds good too.  ���� 
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:31:18
Well i said “ to make it shoot BACK up” if you’re going to look that closely to the context....meaning it was much higher than it is now and i wanted to know what has to happen to make it go BACK up.
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:21:24
So what event do you guys think has to happen or will happen to make btc shoot back up?
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:02:03
What is proof of keys day and what happens if you don’t hold your private keys?
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:13:11
Great answer, thanks.
