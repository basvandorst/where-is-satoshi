Here is my take on the anonymity part. 
It's not anonymous and never was. 
Just a quick comment on privacy: since the blockchain is a public ledger, if someone identifies your public key, they could see any transactions you've done on that address. That is one of the reasons for using a new address for every deposit and spend.

This is a pet peeve of mine as well.  
As an operator, I benefit from my transparency regarding the fees and ID requirements. I'm also very available to my customers via text and phone if necessary. 
As far as the downtime, My ATM has issues that I'm unable to control. The ATM is very sensitive to internet inconsistency and I do my best to reset the ATM as quick as possible. This is usually within 15min of being made aware of the issue. 
We operators also have problems keeping bitcoin in stock since many are bootstrapping their business, having banking issues and/or experiencing an explosion in volume growth. 
Creating a way to make customers aware of ATM status is a problem that is technologically fixable but we need the manufacturers to provide the functionality. CoinATMradar does have an API but I don't believe it was designed to work as a heartbeat/in stock communicator for the ATMs. 
This thread is great for bringing awareness to the issue. Thanks to the OP and commenters.

Call it whatever you want the industry will move forward with a meaningful definition. 
I'm curious though. How are you defining an account? If it has anything to do with setting up an account with the manufacturer/operator to sign into the device, that seems pretty meaningless. It's the wallet that is being used to source bitcoins sold, or deposit bitcoins bought, it's the wallet that is the account. And that "Account" isn't tied to any manufacturer or Operator. Which means you can use that "Account" at a bi-directional, or uni-directional ATM. Good day, Sir.

You would be considered a money transmitter at the Federal Level and likely the State level but you should ask a lawyer. This is not something you want to get wrong. You'll have to invest in an AML program which is a business rules and procedures that define how your business will comply with the Bank Secrecy Act etc.

Scuby22, A lot of people are asking about this. Like some of the others have said, accepting debit cards does not change the money transmitter status. I do however think that we will be able to launch ATMs in the US this year. 
An AML/KYC product is being developed that will integrate with the many of the ATM/Kiosk products on the market. This will make the operators life much easier. If you (or anyone else who is curious about being an operator) wants to discuss more (via phone or email), I'm happy to help.

This sounds like a horrible idea. 
**Shrem:** The biggest challenge to starting a Bitcoin business is banking. When we can get bank accounts, they get shut down without notice! 
**Banker:** We're afraid of the fallout from banking Bitcoin businesses that don't follow proper AML standards. I'm not gonna say any names but there was a high profile Bitcoin company whose CEO was *charged* with willfully failing to prevent money laundering. Needless to say, we lost a lot of confidence after that.

@_date: 2014-08-18 13:55:39
You guessed wrong. 
I'll spell out why operators require ID for as little as $1, but if you care to be educated on Bitcoin ATM regulation in the US, do some more reading. 
The operator needs to report if a buyer exceeds $10,000 in one day. Another thing they look for and must report on is structuring which is when someone is deliberately limiting their transactions over sever days to avoid the $10,000 per day report.  
As an operator, I have no idea how many transactions and to what amounts a user will do in the future. Since the reporting requirements span multiple transactions, even multiple days, operators collect identity at lower dollar amounts. The first amount may be for $20, but let's say 10 more occur that add up to a total of $10,020 dollars. An operator would not have been able to catch that if they started collecting info at $10,000 or even $1,000. 
If an operator wants to risk it and go with a low friction AML strategy, they are likely to do so without being banked. Banks are going to want to see an operator's AML policy before choosing to do business with them. If they see your policy as weak, you don't get a bank account. Without a bank account, you can't wire dollars to the exchange where you replenish your inventory of bitcoins. That means you're limiting your access to bitcoin inventory which usually means higher prices.

Depending on what country you're in, you may or may not have to verify identity. So that can reduce friction to new buyers if they don't have to verify. 
Beyond that though, another point of friction is connecting bank and credit card accounts. That takes a number of days to complete. 
Another point of friction is moving money into an exchange account or Coinbase USD wallet for example. That takes a number of days. 
Perhaps you want convert from bitcoin directly to cash. You would use a Bitcoin ATM. 
Once Bitcoin ATMs exist on both sides of a strong remittance path, people can send money to their family members who can receive it in their local currency.

Read the definition. It is meaningless to make the distinciton you are making. All of them are ATMs. Some uni-directional, some bi-directional. 
The only reason this is an issue is because some are falling for the marketing spin that one of the device manufactures is putting on the definition. They want to differentiate themselves by trying to play down the importance of the other products on the market and single themselves out as the only manufacturer who is making "True ATMs". They are now using that marking spin to try and claim they are the first to launch in Austin based on a technicality. They would like you to think and will claim via headlines that they have launched the first "True" ATM is the US b/c th others are vending machines. This is all marketing spin BS.

There is no secret about my intent to operate Bitcoin ATMs in Atlanta. It would seem to be in my best interest to call it a vending machine if that would get me through the loophole, right? Only it has nothing to do with what you call it, but how it operates. I've lost interest discussion to be honest. So I'll make one more point and we'll see how this plays out in the future. 
It's an Automated Teller Machine. It can perform financial transactions without an attendant. That is the key factor here. Just as Bitcoin has expanded the context of Currency, Asset class, and payment network, the arrival of Bitcoin ATMs has expanded the context of ATMs. You now have traditional ATM, those that are centered around providing cash to people, and Bitcoin ATMs, those that are centered around providing bitcoins to people.

If you mean the KYC requirements then yes. Some countries don't require it and so it's less of a hassle to use the machines. 
If you mean poor user experience, the only ATM that has a reputation of having a poor user experience is Robocoin. It seems like they're trying to clean that op though based on the news of them removing the palm scanner.

You're right, Biometric is NOT required by US AML laws. I believe Robocoin uses Bio to uniquely link a customer to an account. So while bio may be included in an ATM Operators AML Program (The document that outlines how a business will comply with the Bank Secrecy Act(BSA)), there are other ways to uniquely identify customers. Use one of those other identification methods in your AML program, and the problem of biometrics being linked is gone. You will still have to share your identity with the ATM operator though and they will have to verify that you are who you say you are. 
Robocoin and all the other Bitcoin ATM manufacturers don't have their asses on the line. They are not at risk of braking the law. **It's the Operators of the ATMs with that risk.** So the incentive to provide AML tools in an ATM product is to appeal to Operators who want to operate Bitcoin ATMs legally in the US or other nations that require AML.

I'm not sure about specifics in NC, but typically banks are regulated as banks, not money transmitters. Of course, banks have to comply with AML laws anyway.

We got lucky and were contacted by someone who has lots of space in the Airport. It can be $15-20K to just install the ATM depending on if they need to run power to the location or not. Besides that monthly fees to the company we rent the space from would have us in the hole monthly.

This. Biometrics is not required for KYC in the US or anywhere else that I know of. It's used to link a person to the identity details that they provided during sign up. 
I think it's a bit of overkill and it turns off traditional Bitcoiners. That doesn't seem to matter since it doesn't look like their target is Bitcoiners.

HSMs can create, encrypt, and store the private keys. They also have very advanced random number generators to create the keys with. So imagine sending a "signing" request to an HSM. unsigned components of a bitcoin transaction are sent to the HSM along with the ID of the private key that needs to sign them. The HSM is programmed to accept those components, go get the key, decrypt it, sign the message and send the signed bitcoin components back out in a response. 
The keys never see the light of day and the rules are so strict around it that the only thing that gets in and out are those signed and unsigned components.  
@_date: 2014-04-22 11:50:32

It's important to add that all ATM operators have to register as money transmitters at the federal level. So while NM has no money transmitter laws, the federal law still applies. Which means they have to have an AML program. That is why he has to attend the device and log the activity manually. So the one in NM is legal, no grey zone.

Depends on the state your in (if you're talking about the US). Besides that, no matter what you do, you're a money transmitter in the eyes of the federal government (FinCEN) which means you have to comply with the Banks Secrecy Act and do KYC and AML.

Mind maps are a great way of organizing information. I came across this one today. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:21:09
My professional opinion as a 12 year veteran of the traditional payment processing industry and POS expert is that restaurant owners need to start to show interest in Bitcoin functionality integration to their POS manufacturers. There are many people developing POS systems from scratch and offering solutions that are add-ons (non-integrated) to existing payment systems. This approach is not going to work long term. It will only appeal to the most hardcore owners who will put up with the consequences of a non-integrated solution. 
**Integrated solutions vs stand-beside solutions**
The comparison here is not a contest. If a merchant has an existing POS system like [Hot Sauce]( it's going to be a huge pain in the ass to train employees to use the additional payment system when accepting Bitcoin Payments and to settle the books at the end of the night. Where before they print out the reports from the single POS system, now they must print out from both and reconcile them. 
**New POS systems/manufacturers or existing?**
POS manufacturers have been at this for many years. The lessons learned from being in the industry are invaluable. They understand the merchant's needs and they know from experience what works, and what doesn't.  We don't need to re-invent the wheel. If the only value add your POS brings to the table is the ability to accept payments in Bitcoin, the lifespan of that product is very limited. 
We'll soon see the [Hot Sauces]( of the world integrate support with something as simple as printing a QR code on the receipt. Once we get there, the dominoes will fall. Imagine the impact of a restaurant owner being able to just "enable" Bitcoin support just to experiment with it with no risk at all. 
**My suggestion to owners who want to accept Bitcoin as payment?**
There are only 3 ways that a POS manufacturer will make changes like this. 1) They have to due to a mandate. 2) A BIG customer or *MANY customers are asking for it.* 3) Someone just outright pays the development costs. Start reaching out to your POS manufacturer and ask for Bitcoin Support. Encourage your peers to do the same.

@_date: 2014-08-13 14:12:53
I feel it's important to share with any readers who may be considering this, why it is such a bad compliance strategy. 
As a part of registering with FinCEN (Licenses happen at the state level, Fed level is just registration) you have to attest to your business having a written AML program. An AML program that complies with the Bank Secrecy Act ([BSA]( If your AML program is not documented you're out of compliance. Limiting to $500 (and ultimately the balance of the inventory) as a control to detect suspicious activity is one way to make it less likely that a single user will exceed the $10,000/day rule is a particularly bad strategy as it aims to avoid reporting and record retention requirements.  Behavioral patterns are also to be used as a way of detecting money laundering. Something you cannot do unless you know your customer ([KYC](

I don't think this terminology is really meaningful. 
If you think of them as uni-directional and bi-directional, you have the same with traditional ATMs. Most ATMs I see are uni-directional, they only dispense cash. Bank owned ATMs are more often bi-directional but mostly it's just a cash drop, not a bill acceptor. My position is that they are all ATMs. Some are bi, some uni-directional.

If you were an inside guy, probably could. If you were hacking in and had to figure out all the conditions that you needed to get right to do that, you would have to test and experiment which could be detected. So it would be a race against the clock at that point.

Money Transmitters have to have a CIP (Customer Information Policy). This policy outlines the data points that they collect from each customer in effort to know their customers. So If the payment card details are one of the data points on their CIP then that would explain the reason she provided.

Might as well just get a tablet and run one of the micro-merchant apps like [Blockchain Merchant]( or [Coinbase "Point of Sale"]( 
These stand beside solutions are at best usable for business owners who are also Bitcoiners. All the other business owners are going to expect all payments to be integrated into the same system. Why? Employee training, consolidated reporting, counter top space, and hardware costs. Most of all because it is the industry standard that they have come to expect in POS products.

So can a company identify a transaction as a stealth transaction without the ability to identify the destination address or are stealth transactions completely unidentifiable?

Keep in mind that the petroleum payment industry is based on auth/completion transaction sets. This is so you can get authorized to pump fuel, fill up, then the completion gives the final total. What happens when you can't to auth completions? You have to prepay. Prepay means you cant fill up unless you're really good and take the time to calculate how much fuel you can need to fill up. So Bitcoin in the petro industry means two things. 1) the inconvenience of prepaying. 2) customers not filling up which costs the gas stations sales volume. 
The auth/completion gap also comes into play at restaurants and bars. The protocol will need to be updated to support a solution to this and it's not an easy solution.

Good start but a lot of empty space on the screen. Is that how big the touch screen will be?
The "thank you for using..." screen, text with with the transaction details, it's pretty small and seems more appropriate on a receipt. The URL is of no use since no one will remember it. 
On the first screen, i would rather see "Sell Bitcoins" than "Cash Out". Bitcoin ATM is not a casino.
What is "Transfer Bitcoins" on the screen with the $60 withdrawal? Is it a withdrawal or transfer? mingling the functions seems out of place. 
No screens for a user to identify and enroll themselves or sign in under that identity?

As an MSB, they have an AML policy. It sounds like part of their AML policy is to get more information when certain conditions are met. If they are audited, they will be able to pull out the data and say "look, see we are following our policy in practice". 
So compiling is absolutely part of compliance, but so is confidentiality. Your data will likely gather dust unless your activity crosses into the behavior that they have to report, or your account is randomly chosen for an audit. Anyone having access to the data will be under a confidentiality agreement.

I'm finishing up a blog on this right now but here is the TL;DR. 
Any business that accepts electronic payments is going to expect this new electronic payment to be accepted through the same device that they use to accept credit/debit payments, whether that be a full integrated POS system or a stand-beside terminal. This is the industry standard and it's standard for a reason. Usability is the main reason, but merchants are very sensitive to any hardware they have to buy to facilitate electronic payments. Why are they sensitive? Because they have been getting fucked by electronic payments for all this time and they've already spent several hundred dollars on the equipment they have for credit/debit card payments. 
The product in the video could only be a success for merchants who never have accepted credit/debit card payments and have no intention to do so in the future. 
It is a great proof of concept for the payment protocol (BIP70) though.

Calling something an ATM doesn't mean it is treated that way by the law. It's how the thing operates and what it's purpose is that matters. The government already has authority over them. In the US, Bitcoin (whatever you want to call them) operators are money transmitters. They are required to comply with the bank secrecy act. That won't change unless FinCEN decides so.

I don't presume to know the details of their AML programs or reasoning of Coinbase or Circle, but I can share some possible reasons for the difference. 
There is a lot of room within the law for a business to determine what their AML program will consist of. So you can't compare two companies and say "Ah Ha!, one does this and the other doesn't so that means it's not a legal obligation." They are legally obligated to have an AML program and follow that program to a T. But the most likely the push toward these more intrusive monitoring policies is to satisfy their banking partners. Without their banking relationships, the business is done. This risk management plain and simple. 
So why the difference? Perhaps Circle's bank has not pushed for this level of KYC. Perhaps they are implementing it now. Something I am very curious about though is, how long do they follow those transactions? How many address movements (or hops) do they follow the coins purchased on their platform?

I'm not sure about what gets reported to the IRS but your bank is supposed to file a SAR (suspicious activity report) with FinCEN if deposit amounts total over $10k per day. If those deposits are out of nowhere, that will seem especially suspicious to them. That doesn't mean your going to get a knock at your door though. Go read up on the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). 
Also, if someone deposits in amounts under $10k to avoid that threshold, that is called Structuring.  The idea there is, if this person has more than $10k to deposit over 2 days, it's possible he/she had the whole amount but just split it across two days to avoid the SAR. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:59:40
The FinCEN ruling as Money Transmitter is still in play and the banks are going to want to see a good AML/KYC program as well. So identification requirements still apply. What isn't there is the State auditing you several times a year and dropping by at random to make sure you're doing everything right. No surety bond requirements either. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:15:55
I feel it's important to share with any readers who may be considering the Magg0tt approach, why it is such a bad compliance strategy. 
As a part of registering with FinCEN (Licenses happen at the state level, Fed level is just registration) you have to attest to your business having a written AML program. An AML program that complies with the Bank Secrecy Act ([BSA]( If your AML program is not documented you're out of compliance. Limiting to $500 (and ultimately the balance of the inventory) as a control to detect suspicious activity is one way to make it less likely that a single user will exceed the $10,000/day rule is a particularly bad strategy as it aims to avoid reporting and record retention requirements.  Behavioral patterns are also to be used as a way of detecting money laundering. Something you cannot do unless you know your customer ([KYC](

Bitcoin is not about anonymity. How could Bitcoin with all it's privacy issues in the blockchain be about anonymity? Psudonymity is a side effect of the Bitcoin technology.


Bitcoin is about decentralization and consensus. Anonymity clouds the conversation around Bitcoin to it's detriment. Privacy is important and I think the KYC thing creates issues around that, but KYC is not undoing some virtue of Bitcoin.

Great things are just around the corner though as I'll be launching a new company and getting some ATMs out there in the public very soon.

Uni-directional ATM operators are money transmitters at the federal level. No changing that unless FinCEN changes their stance (not likely).  
State, it depends on how the state law reads and in some cases, there is no state money transmitter laws at all (like in New Mexico).

In the blog, I'm talking about integration of bitcoin payments directly in the merchants existing POS, rather than add a second one. Wallet integration is not covered although my assumption is that any bitcoin wallet can be used. Which is as it should be.

The IRS ruling is meaningless in this context.
For the purposes of lessening the regulatory burden on Bitcoin ATM operators, when done right, Operators are not burdened by the state regulation. **That does not mean that the Federal AML/KYC burden is also relieved.** No matter what happens at the state level, and at the IRS, unless FinCEN changes their position, ATM operators in the US will have to identify their customers. Beyond that, of course, the banks still require AML/KYC from the Operators and that will likely not change.

Location is something I thought would be the hard part but it's really not if you get local publicity about  your intention. The retailers will come to you if they know about it. 
I would say, first research what kind of funding you need and the regulatory requirements of your location. That will likely involve getting a lawyer and a BSA/AML expert in your area.

In the state of CA, Bitcoin ATMs are not money transmitters. Online exchanges are. Coinbase would also be excluded as a money transmitter with regard to the state of CA.
This has no impact on the federal position of Bitcoin sellers being money transmitters.
Still reviewing to make sure I'm reading this right. seems a little too good to be true but would be in line with the Texas guidance.
It is worth noting that I'm not a lawyer and I may have to retract this after speaking to mine. Also, this bill does not clearly define crytpo-currency or Virtual currency as the Texas guidance did. It seems the biggest thing they wanted to change was the fact that if I pay a bill to an agent of a payee, and my obligation to the payee is satisfied at that point, that is not money transmission. 
As a commenter said below that i didn't specify is bitcoin or any other crypto is not mentioned. **Also, this bill is not law yet.**
@_date: 2014-08-26 19:09:34
Texas is still the most reasonable so far as they differentiate between an exchange that holds customer funds and a Bitcoin ATM which acts more like a currency exchange if they are selling directly from their inventory of bitcoin.

A few reasons...
1) it's hard to convince people to change their old ways.
2) In an effort to maintain dominance, the Credit Card brands and banks aren't playing nicely.
 
3) As a result, as a merchant, you either support one wallet or the other. This adds to the adoption problem.
Ideally, we could choose a wallet, connect our account to it, use it at any location that accepts NFC payments. The industry has made a clusterfuck out of it though.

Genesis1 also has bi-directional capabilities. 
While I agree with your reasoning, the market pressure is on buying BTC. Operating a bi-directional ATM/Kiosk ties up cash in a business that is already burdened with a huge amount of float. Once the market starts to normalize and more people are looking for a way to cash out small* amounts of BTC, the demand for bi-directional operation will make more sense. 
*people who want to cash out thousands of dollars of BTC will likely use an exchange or broker who will deposit into a bank account rather than walk away from a device with stacks of cash.

@_date: 2015-01-26 21:41:12
If you're running a business like a Bitcoin ATM operator for example, your bank and or investors may have a preference for a licensed exchange due to a perception of lower risk. Most state MT licenses have capital requirements and other measures to ensure that they have the ability to cover the funds they are holding on a user's behalf.  I have a hard time beliving that a US based exchange would operate long without at least registering as a money transmitter with FinCEN. 
On a side note, there is no license for Federal (FinCEN)  money transmitters. It's a registration. States license, feds have registration.

We're selective about who we discuss that with but I will say that Atlanta is a strong market and we have the lowest fees in the out of all the ATMs in the state of GA. 
But generally, this type of business can and is often profitable for operators. One of the biggest factors though is banking. Without it, operators have to pay 5% or more just to get their cash back into an exchange. With banking, they can wire to an exchange and get spot price. That is why the fees are so high. Once we (the industry) can get stable bank accounts and you have competition in a single market, the fees will fall.

No. After the fork, the difficulty of the chain will be will be less volatile. 
So instead of the profitability of BCH dropping from 1.5x to 1, the profitability might drop to 1.2x.
That would result in some or all the miners remaining on the BCH chain. Of course all the while, the BTC chain is crawling, fees are rising, value is dropping.  
Edit: No difficulty adjustment is happening when the fork takes place. A change is being made to the algorithm that adjusts the difficulty.

Thank you! 
This guy has no idea what he's talking about. If you are dealing with fiat in an exchange, banks will be involved. Why? Because if I want to be a profitable Bitcoin ATM I need to get coins at a good price. I can't do that without having a bank account so I can send USD to exchanges. The other option is working with some kind of LBC dealer which becomes very risky and very expensive. Also hardly reliable. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:01:49
Check out my blog on Bitcoin ATM regulation and compliance. If you're not aware, Bitcoin ATM operators have quite a bit of work to do on the back side of ATM operation. If you're more interested in having an ATM in your location, you should work with an ATM operator who will partner with you to host their ATM at your location.

That fee was likely for the currency exchange.

BTC will have to fork to fix difficulty adjustment to accommodate a world where it has to fight with BCH for hashpower, or hardfork to change POW.

The live person depends on if it's part of your AML program or if your ATM needs attendance for technical reasons. 
Lamassu ATMs tend to lock up from time to time. So it's very annoying to have to go reset it. Mine recently sat locked up for the weekend while I was away in Chicago. FML.
That is the only ATM I have personal experience with but I have most of the options and their specs listed here...

Why are you being such a dick? I do nothing but help people who are curious about Bitcoin ATM operation. See those blogs and that website up there? Shit tons of help for anyone willing to read them and trust me, people read the shit out of them and they're very grateful for gaining the knowledge that cost me months and thousands. 
So you're butthurt because I didn't answer a question that I have no business answering? Did you see the story about the ATM in New Jersey? Take a look at the photos. Ever seen that ATM before? Probably not because it's soon to be released. I'm not in a position to discuss the product release but I think It would be helpful to know that there is an option on the horizon that is worth looking into. 
P.S. Fuck off

Lamassu has designed the remote software update procedure so they only lamassu can trigger the device to pull a code update. If you take out the tablet, then configure it to allow remote connections, you can upload an update file and manually trigger the update procedure. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:30:19
Assuming you're using a smartphone to take the picture, yes. This is because the image of the QR is backlit. If you just print out the QR then it's less likely to be read by the ATM. 
It also depends on the ATM. The above is true for an optical (camera) based reader vs a bar-code scanner type reader.

Who said I wasn't supposed to talk about the ATM? I just said I couldn't talk about the release. Definitely a poor choice of words since I don't know when It will be released. The fact remains that a new product on the horizon is relevant to the threads where I mentioned it. 


I regret adding the hashtag about enforcements to that post so thanks for giving me the opportunity to say that. But even if I'm a dick as you insinuate, being a dick and being helpful to those curious about getting into the ATM business are not mutually exclusive. I've helped hundreds of people with their interest in Bitcoin ATM operation. I dare say far more times than I come across as "100% dick" on the internet.

Is your question about blockchain analysis/tracing transactions back to someone or identity disclosure? 
AML/KYC is very broad and I take that to mean identity disclosure among other things. If your question is about tracing transactions on LN, I'm not qualified to answer that. My thoughts on that comment are; I would want to know what he/she specifically means by AML/KYC.

Lamassu devices are great for users, not so great for operators. Their back end functionality is very limited. It does take a large investment if you want to do it right. Check out my blog for info on AML/KYC. I'm happy to discuss more over PM or email.  
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:08:29
Send me your info and I'll put it on [
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:59:09
If a service provider who transacts on LN wants to require your ID info to participate in a transaction, you'll have to choose to disclose or find another service provider who doesn't have those requirements.
AML/KYC is done at entry and exit points, not by snooping traffic as a route participant.

Of course PCI doesn't apply to bitcoin companies. Who says they do?
The part that you're wrong about is that in most cases, it's not the retailer who needs to be PCI compliant, it's the payments system. Most retailer use a 3rd party payment system, that is designed in a way to keep them of scope for PCI requirements. 
Years ago if you had an integrated payments system where payment card data was stored in-flight within the retailer's network then they would be in scope of PCI but the payment services providers have gotten smarter and architected the systems so that the payment card data never even enters the retailer network. 
Of course there are exceptions with huge companies who build and maintain their own payment system. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:41:47


You're comment was written poorly.

At Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose, one of the booths had some booth babes. The whole thing backfired because no one was going to their booth. It was just awkward. There was no expectation of having any meaningful interaction with the models whether about product, Bitcoin, or anything else that beautiful women in suggestive outfits might bring to mind in a single bitcoiner. They were basically there to scam people into the booth.

If you operated a Lamassu you'd know that while server software updates are not a problem, only Lamassu can push software updates to the *machines*. Not even the operators can do that without disassembling the ATM to remove the tablet then using a linux box to connect to the tablet via USB cable, then SSH into the tablet. And to do that you have to request the password from Lamassu.

Keep a target dollar value in your hot wallet and sell from there. Setup the ATM to buy from an exchange as you sell. Then occasionally move the newly purchased coins from the exchange to the hot wallet. Since you buy at the same time you sell, volatility is not a problem.

Dispenser capacity: hardly anyone sells bitcoin to ATMs so you don't have to worry about the dispenser capacity for a while. Having two means you can dispense two denominations. Demand for selling bitcoin to the machine is so low right now, its not even worth anymore discussion. Recyclers with a few notes for each denomination would likely meet your needs. The big difference is if you want your bills dispensed one at a time or in a stack like you get from traditional ATMs. 
As far as how a bill validator works, check this video for info on how the one in the lamassu works.

* Bill acceptor - accepts bills from users who buy bitcoins from the ATM and stacks them in the stacker (cash box). This is the minimum a Bitcoin ATM needs.
* Bill recycler - This is an alternate to a bill acceptor. It both accepts bills to be stacked in the cash box as well as holds bills that can be dispensed one at a time (recycled).
* Bill Dispenser - This is what typical ATMs have. An operator stocks these cash boxes with whatever amount they think is necessary and those bills are dispensed when users sell bitcoin to the ATM. 
* Float - This represents all the money that is tied up in the process of keeping bitcoin and cash available in the ATM.
To have a recycler and a dispenser is a bit redundant. Typically ATMs have either or. You must be looking at the [GeneralBytes BATMThree]( since it can be ordered with all three. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:32:09
Customer service is a benefit. Will the exchange send it right away? If the buyer doesnt get the coin in the wallet soon after, is it the exchanges fault or is it a confirmation issue. If they have issues with confirmations, you'll be able to see that through your own wallet rather than depending on the exchange. I have my ATM sell from the wallet, buy from the exchange, then I back fill the wallet periodically. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:03:09

Sorry but you don't sound like an expert on AML. Bare minimum AML policies qualifies as all three. There is a lot of wiggle room within an AML policy and weaker your policy is the more constrained your banking capabilities will be. As a side note, Money Orders are monitored very closely.

Thanks for the clarification but I don't know if I would use those words. 
They acquired the ATM network (ATMs + relationships/agreements with locations) which is what I was using LibertyTeller to refer to. They didn't become libertyX (publicly) until the in store purchasing stuff went live. So right or wrong, I think of their previous ATM operation/network as LibertyTeller which is why said it the way I did.

Not likely to be at better prices and a fixed point in space is not necessarily a problem.

Exchanges like CampBX are a dying breed. You won't find any more US based exchanges with such lax KYC policies. In fact, if you do it's more than likely a scam.

Robocoin is the worst fail in Bitcoin ATMs. Bitcoin ATM operators need to comply with AML laws but there should be a balance between that and user experience.
My ATM operates like this...
* Press start
* type phone number
(new users) pick the amount of Bitcoin you want to purchase per day
* phone only = up to $100
* plus first/last name = up to $500
* plus address = up to $1000
* Or ID scan = up to $10k

Most in the US now require at least a phone with text support be typed in followed by typing the one time password that is texted to that number. It's also intended that the phone belong to the person buying the bitcoins. Without a smartphone, yes. Without a cell phone, depends.

There is no requirement for the terminal to host any other payment method (e.g., credit card) or for a CC processor to even be involved (this, of course, may depend on your PSP). The Bitcoin solution works stand-alone.
This would only be viewed as a benefit by someone who has no idea what a merchant expects when adding a payment method to their business.

But these challenges of working with PSPs don't always exist. The reason it's a problem here is because they are working with a stand beside payment terminal, meaning, it's not integrated into the POS (although it can be). 
The home run would be to integrate with a POS system (the computer part of the payments tech) instead of the device where a PIN is typed (the PIN Pad). That way, they can support bitcoin payments without the need to work with PSPs at all. They would however have to work with a POS manufacturer.

Very interesting. Here are a few points.
1) I like the idea of an operator earning money as an escrow, but I wonder how many of his/her own sales would be cannibalized in the process.
2) There is a significant distinction between a Bitcoin business that holds customer funds and one that does not. In most states in the US, those that do not hold customer funds are not considered money transmitters by the state. So in some cases, being an escrow ATM opens you up to more regulation than being just a Bitcoin ATM. 
3) Cash recycling ATMs are very expensive and due to the number of moving parts, require more maintinance. There are some that recycle 40 or 60 bills of a single denomination but that is not likely to be enough to operate perpetually without refilling.

That is a really good point. the way they have written this, they could actually regulate anything as a money transmitter if they wanted to.
(11) "Money transmission" means to engage in the business of selling or issuing payment instruments, **selling or issuing stored value,** or receiving money or monetary value for transmission to a location within or outside the United States.

Someone has to take all the cash and put it into or out of the banking system. How do they turn their bitcoin into dollars in the bank? If they have a bunch of dollars, how do they get it to an exchange to buy bitcoin? It's not so simple which is why they spend the money they do on vaults and trucks. Don't you think an industry with hundreds of millions would do things a better way if they could?
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:51:51
They probably do it to avoid KYC. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:13:54


and this


Are two different use case but are both "holding" funds because there are 3 parties. Turn it into two parties where a Bitcoin ATM sells from their inventory to a buyer and that is not money transmission in most states. 3 parties and you're now in control of value as it changes hands.

Good point. I didn't explain why I don't think it's that impressive and based on the article, it seems we are aligned. Here is where I'm not impressed. 
TL;DR They allude to the device being able to be used as the single point of electronic payments (both cards and bitcoins) which is technically possible, but realistically they have just ported their check out app to a traditional payments terminal and left it to the merchants to ask their PSP to support it. 


This statement tells me that the realistic use of this device is to provide a terminal that only accepts bitcoin payments. This is because in order for this device to be used for card transactions with PINs, the PIN debit key (the key that encrypts the PIN for the debit/check card) would have to be injected into the devices by the Payment Service Provider (PSP)(or 3rd party of their behalf). Bitpay is putting less focus on working with PSPs than it is on being a one stop shop for a payments industry device with software to allow bitcoin payments. 


Here is a gotcha which means it's probably very expensive to purchase one of these for the sole purpose of accepting bitcoin payments. 


So here we have the actual value proposition of the device. BitPay check out app on a traditional payments terminal. 
In order for a merchant to use this device as their single point of electronic payment acceptance, BitPay needs to build relationships with PSPs and work toward getting their app installed on the device when it's ordered from the PSP (PIN debit key already injected).

(11) "Money transmission" means to engage in the business of selling or issuing payment instruments, selling or issuing **stored value**, or receiving money or monetary value for transmission to a location within or outside the United States.

You can't make up your own context here. 
The "electronic record" wording is in the context of "monetary value", not value as you define or even how it's commonly defined around the world. "Monetary value" is defined in the legislation ( "Monetary value" means a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money) and it has nothing to do with how much something is worth or if it's value fluctuates.

Atlanta Bitcoin here: 
This weekend at the Crypto-currency Con was a great success. 
I'm going to try and answer all the questions from this thread in one post.
Q: Is this an ATM really?
A: I would rather call it a dispenser or something similar but people are able to identify with the term and "Bitcoin ATM" has taken off with the masses. Overall, I think the conversation about "It is an ATM? What is this if not an ATM?" is a productive one and there may be a regulatory or legal reason to stick with one over the other.
Q: Does it spit out physical Bitcoins?
A: No.
Q: Does it print a receipt?
A: There is no receipt either. If there ever is a receipt it will not have a private key. It will simply identify the amount in, percentage, conversion rate, and to address.
Q:What does this "ATM" Do exactly?
A: Cash in, BTC out (to QR scanned wallet address).
Q: Can it also convert Bitcoin to Cash?
A: No. This is solving the problem of obtaining BTC and much more cost effective than those that do both.
Q: Where do the Bitcoins come from?
A: The device can be configured to pull from a hosted wallet or an exchange. If coins are not in the exchange based wallet, It can buy on the fly and deliver. It is very configurable with other hybrid options.
Q: How much is the fee?
A: The fee is based on a percentage which is configurable. We demoed it at 3%. The fee will depend on the market.
Q: What about regulation?
A: We have hired a great team to work on this. It will not be deployed until I'm all set with my local and federal 
**The Machine**
Q: Can this be used outdoors?
A: Indoor Only.
Q: How is it secured, can someone just walk off with it?
A: It's very heavy. Probably weighs more than coolcityboy :) It will be mounted/bolted to a steal stand, then bolted to the concrete floor. Just like typical ATMs.
Re: Physical ATM Security.
A: This thing is a beast. Very strong outside and vault inside. A very pro job with top components. I'll let Lamassu share any further comments if they wish.
**When, where, I want one too!**
Q: When can we expect to see these in the wild?
A: Targeting late November.
Q: Where will you install the first one?
A: In Atlanta, location not disclosed yet.
Q: Is there a list of locations?
A: There will be on our website as we deploy. I'm trying to talk Localbitcoins.com into building in Bitcoin "ATM" 
functionality. Please help by telling them you want to see ATMs listed!
Q: I have a business in Atlanta and I'm interested in hosting one.
A: Fantastic! Contact me via PM or the website/email.
Q: How can I franchise these?
A: PM to discuss.
Q: Are you looking for investors?
A: Contact me via PM or the website/email.
I'm happy to answer any more questions. 
Thanks for reading!

Yep, Bitpay. They absorb the risk of the fluctuating market. If you want $100 for the invoice, you will get $100 in your bank account. 
Their invoice code will check the current price and present the invoice amount in Bitcoin to the payee. The payee will have a window of time to pay the invoice for the amount of coin that was quoted.

@_date: 2013-12-05 13:08:48
Also, there is no Interest generated from Bitcoin just by owning it. It's not like money in a bank where the bank loans it out and pays you interest. It grows in value.  So if you wanted to extract some of that increased value, you would have to sell some of the coins. When you do that, now you're gaining less as the price rises. Do that again and again and you're investment yield less and less and you eventually spend all your coins.
