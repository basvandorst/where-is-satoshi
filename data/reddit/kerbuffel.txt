Holy shit, I knew western union was ripping people off but those fees are insane.
I'm curious what they're long term plan is for utilizing cryptocurrencies. Even if bitcoin was more volatile than it already is, it would still be better than using western union; I can't see them sticking around without major changes to their business model.

How was this a review of security? Maybe solvency. I think this is just theater to make people feel better after mtgox.

This would actually be bigger for me. I don't normally get parking tickets; I do normally find myself not having any change on me for the meters.
Of course, most cities are moving away from change-fed parking meters to kiosks that support credit cards. Bitcoin won't be able to help with those when they break.

Exactly, and the risk is low. While the article showcases an "everyday small business owner", the fact is you're probably not going to have the irs size your accounts.

Dell accepts bit coin. That's the joke. :)

At the time it was the second highest comment, and that's about as far I got before I closed the tab. :|

I think this is a perfect example of why this subreddit is known for having an attitude problem. That statement adds nothing to your reply except to make someone that wants to adopt bitcoin feel dumb. Why would you want to do that?

Are you willing to root it? If not, Nexus.

Yeah, that comment doesn't even make sense. There's no other html there, anyone that is going in there to add information won't need it pointed out to then where to paste it.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:50:19
Is anyone actually doing that? I haven't been paying really close attention but I haven't been seeing any positive posts about mtgox.
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:10:36
Yeah, that was the first thing I thought. The second was "why is this a video at all?" Would name more sense for this information to be in a normal web page.

I disagree, all assuming malice does is get people worked up. If it truly is fraud, an investigation will reveal that.

This is the best advice in the thread.

Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence.

I don't have the link handy, but there was an article a while back about how immigrants were using bitcoin to send money back home instead of using western union or similar services. I think this is just going to harm people sending money to their parents, children, or other people for legitimate purposes, and not stop anyone from money laundering. 
And since those people that have legitimate reasons to send money, they'll need to change methods; they may very well switch to sending money via bitcoin.
I doubt Chase is only doing this to prevent people from moving to bitcoin, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't at least a factor. And all it's going to do is send more people to using the currency.

This is my thought exactly. While it' great they had someone come in and prove that their books look good right now, there are _so many_ things that could go wrong in a million other different places.

Or, you know, living in an apartment. While I don't share the OP's concern and have had packages of all shape and size delivered to my home address, I've never _had_ to have an item delivered to my apartment if I would've preferred to remain anonymous. 
I actually have a PO Box now for other reasons, so I haven't had anything delivered to my home in years.

There are lots of reasons to run a node in a cloud service. If nothing else, most cloud providers offer a free tier, so you can basically run a node for free and learn more about bitcoin that way and contribute to the network vs an SPV wallet.

I think when the point you're trying to make is "everything becomes an internet based technology" the word "natural" is not a good choice. :P I'd go with "logical" or "intelligent."  Or just drop the adjective entirely.

I'm not aware of any AWS outage that affected more than one of their regions. I'd be curious if there's a way to determine what region these instances are running in, and see if they are evenly distributed. 
My assumption would be no -- the default region is us-east-1, which most people I've talked to run in.

If I were to come up to you and offer you a handful of shiny rocks and tell you it's magic rock money that it's worth two pizzas, but you've never really heard of magic rock money and there's no way for me to turn said rocks into actual money, would you give me two pizzas?
Probably not. That was what the situation was like when this dude got the pizzas. Only a few people had even heard of bitcoin, and there wasn't any easy way to buy or sell bitcoin online. So while the ticker may say it was worth a few cents, that only counts if you could find someone to buy it off you for that price. Which you couldn't.
Now, say I tell you my pile of rocks is worth $250, _ten times_ what a pizza is worth. And while you can't now, in a little while you'll be able to turn those rocks into cash, maybe even for _a hundred times_ what a pizza is worth! 
Well. You  _still_ probably wouldn't give me two pizzas. But there's more gullible people out there than you that could be convinced that it's a deal worth making. And that's what happened here: the dude pulled a fast one of the pizza place. Sure, with hindsight it seems like the guy wasted his bitcoin. But in 2010, it was a novelty -- "hey guys I ran this program on my computer for a couple weeks and look, I got the pizza guy to trade me two pies for it! What a scam!" 
You can't look at the beginning of bitcoin and compare it to now. There's a ton of infrastructure around it, whole companies built to support it. Back in 2010, everyone was making fun of that pizza place for making the deal; today everyone is making fun of the guy for losing out on millions of dollars.

Right now, it's just "chip and no pin." It's actually just super frustrating, because the chip process takes 10x longer than swiping, and there is zero security benefit.

Not even the front anymore. One of my newer credit cards only has my name on the front, and then all the information on the back.

I recently moved to Detroit, and pretty much every time I use my card I am asked for ID. I thought it was just because I was hitting up corner stores and such, but even at the Targets and Walgreens they will ask. 
My wallet is out anyway, so it's not that big of a deal, and saves them a ton of headache down the line.

I agree. I ended up just finding a dude on localbitcoin but it did feel somewhat like a drug deal.
