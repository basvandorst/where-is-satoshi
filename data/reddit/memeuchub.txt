Wouldn't have Satoshi been Bitcoin's first billionaire? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:09:21
never seen this one
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:21:40
Thought this was a parody...
I still think this is just a rogue employee trying to promote btc; the bucket looks poorly photoshopped.

Why would you go here? It's more of a gimmick. They'll charge obscene exchange rates.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:47:50
This, probably. It's very similar to people choosing to receive their salaries in bitcoin - it's more of a breakthrough rather than a convenience.

Sorry, just reading this reply. This is the right mentality!

$100 to $83.50 in 90 days.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:40:26
Until, of course, people learn of Ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:03:00
That's the problem with becoming mainstream. Remember: *most people aren't smart.*
@_date: 2018-08-05 09:34:15
What an insight! 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:38:06
Yup. Just like the World Trade Center and Lehman Brothers!
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:07:42
...but do have $55M.
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:23:39
Reaching levels unseen since January 2019!

Thank you for the gold kind mogul!

Really? It must've been a large, representative sample - surely? China's such a large country, surely they needed a sample of atleast 10 - 20,000 - including enough people from China's rural agricultural provinces? 
I have a feeling this is just a sample of 100 people they interviewed on the streets of Shanghai.

Of course, although it doesn't really require much insight to predict it.

As soon as banks are backed into a corner - they'll lobby the government and where will BTC go? Regulated to the bottom of the depths of hell.
The current Treasury Sec worked at Goldman. The last worked at Citi. The one before him? A MD at a private equity firm in NY. Before him? Goldman.

Sure. My great grandfather's $1 is worth $0.05. But my great grandfather's hourly wage of $1 doesn't remain at $1, does it?

This is actually taken from his reddit AMA, and has very little significance. It's almost like saying: "There will be another significant school shooting in the United States - it's a certainty."

I rather have him return the untraceable amount of Bitcoin that I lost 4 years ago, regardless of millions of others also being in the same boat! /s
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:41:27
It also has huge potential to go down!
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:47:07
Precisely. Bitcoin may disappear - let's face it. Blockchain itself will survive and flourish forever.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:16:07
Sure. It won't poof out of existence; most things digital never do. I just see alternatives making better use of blockchain's capabilities.
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:54:13
Play it safe. 35% - 45% BTC,  25% - 35% Monero, 20% Ether, and whatever you have left you can pump into like NEO or something.

Sure, the ones the size of rooms. Although that wasn't available to the common folk or firms. We're assuming that it took the computer 14 years from widespread availability to widespread adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:45:17
We can pool cash together to purchase the domain

The "Internet" in its modern form wasn't publicly available until the late 1980's / early 1990's. There's no point counting from the time it was available in some private research facility, right?
Also, the first office computers really took off in the 1970's - 80's. Seeing the number of firms that quickly adopted it, especially in the financial sector - I wouldn't be surprised if 50 million workers alone used the computer by the mid 80's.
