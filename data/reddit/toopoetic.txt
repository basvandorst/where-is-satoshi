bitcoin people can make any headline suddenly about bitcoin.

Installed and purchased a sticker for 5 dollars with shipping within like 10 mins. Not bad at all. Might want to translate the "Contract Details" from code though.

People can do as they please and I'm allowed to judge them by their actions. I'm also not 24 and do not live in the Midwest anymore but thanks for the creep.
Similar to you living on crypto subreddits but you hate their origin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:37:45
Eh? Someone stupid enough to invest solely off the word of a co-worker sowed their own fate.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:41:44
Luckily we have ways to test such things.

Feel free to donate your wealth where ever you see fit.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:51:34
No. I already told you that I'm supporting your save the homless and feed the hungry fund.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:16:44
It's your fund,  you get chose whatever name you see fit.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:49:57
Really making a positive change in the community I see! Thanks good sir!
Waiting on your poverty pineapple fund! Consider me your first backer!

Don't worry, he's an '*eternal student*' so I'd imagine he will learn from his mistakes and be a better Faketoshi in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:34:52
And by vendor you mean everything is priced up by 2% so you the consumer actually are in the end paying the fees.

Any chance of uploading the transcript to a website that doesn't require an account for PDF download?
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:14:21
Serious question. 
Where does the defense come up with his argument. Does he ask Ross what actually happened or just try to poke holes in the prosecution based off of the charges and evidence they present?
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:50:49
Agree to disagree I suppose.
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:51:41
People love to think that it's as simple as having money to begin with. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:42:53
Sorry if I was misspoke. I meant like pretrial or outside of the courtroom. I assume he actually met Ulbricht and talked a bit before the trial, no?
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:04:35
Can I borrow some tin foil or are you all out after making all those hats?

And you're living in a pipe dream. Also it's publicly, community college must not teach spelling.
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:52:28
LOL wut, not comparable at all.
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:32:00
No offense but I feel like we should really break the link to the scam website in the OP. I don't feel like it's smart to post a working hyperlink to a known scamming website, even in a post alerting about it.
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:15:11
I like swiftkey but I'm a dragger so it might not suit your needs.
@_date: 2017-01-01 14:03:00
And bitcoin is worth infinite times since the date of creation /s
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:03:15
So switching from android to ios made you put an 'a' in publicly? Or are you saying that ios has a spellcheck that corrected publicly to publicaly?
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:12:36
Switch up your keyboard. There are plenty of non default keyboards that are better and will assist you in not slaughtering words.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:00:33
Yeah, bitcoin isn't ready for them yet though.

We're not. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:47:56


The bitcoin community is a total meme of itself haha
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:47:50
Love this kind of content. This is what this sub needs. Quality content. The best content.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:48:44
Can we break the links to possibly malicious pages please? Not sure why we're doing this scammers work for them and spreading the message.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:38:18
I know you'll hate me for this but can we get a source that isn't russia today? Maybe multiple sources to back each other up?
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:46:22
Yeah.... OR it's not.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:34:46
Was just trying to stick to the criteria you set when starting this thread.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:53:34
Probably direct off the CIA assembly line! /s

Satoshi is like some untouchable deity to you.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:51:36
Got any evidence for that? I'd love an article or two that would back up your position that "This is a staged coup by Western intelligence against Maduro"
Also, when you say 'western intelligence' can you be more specific on exactly which countries you think are responsible for this?
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:02:14
Definitely a fair assumption. I guess I just don't like leaving the possibility there. Sorry I came off kind of rude.
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:14:24


Nothing that was done under the 'satoshi' name amounts to anything this impressive.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:48:15
You don't deserve to post on reddit. Your computer came at the expense of others.
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:53:42
Mind blown. You're so right.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:36:55
This thread lol
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:41:41
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:23:32
Turn your computer off. Your computer has nothing to do with the transaction being confirmed. I would really suggest learning more about bitcoin before you move on, you seem to be lacking key information.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:37:03


I forgot the part where people chopped their hand off to make the processor board. Oh wait...
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:33:05
I bet you anything this article makes tons more than his average article. You all aren't helping. Don't feed the troll.
@_date: 2016-09-20 20:51:10
Why would I pay for youtube red. It's way to close in price to something like netflix for the average quality of video.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:45:37


Acting as if though all systems can be exploited to the same degree with the same amount of effort is just naive.
@_date: 2016-09-23 19:54:46
Sounds like you live your life with all your eggs in 1 basket. Hopefully everything works out for you.
@_date: 2016-09-10 13:32:47
Bitcoin is considered a commodity. So clearly not.
@_date: 2016-09-18 13:14:39
depending on how you get paid.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:49:04


No trans allowed in my shop! /s
@_date: 2016-09-23 20:04:12
Now go clean your room. If you really think speculation isn't the largest thing driving the bitcoin price though...
@_date: 2016-09-09 18:54:08
Since when is bitcoin a currency?
@_date: 2016-09-15 20:50:37
So... who is the donor? You still don't know.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:37:13
You think they stole the bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-09-23 19:52:18


@_date: 2019-01-21 18:27:59
Automatic monthly payments is why patreon is attractive. If your donators have to remember to donate each month your donation totals will drop drastically.
@_date: 2016-09-15 20:59:17

Don't worry open bazaar has already replaced ebay /s
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:49:24
He's got many issues. That's just 1 of them.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:35:53


See you in prison next time you speed. You must not know what came before bitcoin because this all easily could be illegal. But I guess you wouldn't be here then.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:32:51
came here to say this. Good job sir.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:45:06
Don't regret the desk. I got one a couple years ago and it was a game changer.

When your life is threatened.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:33:57
Too bad we couldn't like use our head to come to a logical conclusion.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:23:38
It's his second time making this claim. In my opinion it's somewhat understandable to be annoyed that he's made the claim again and still is yet to provide proof that he should easily be able to do if he's satoshi.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:23:27


It's called sensationalism. Journalists wrote all kinds of BS about silk road. If you ask anyone who actually was on the website those rules existed and were followed.
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:53:13
If that were true anti politics anti big bank Bernie would be supreme leader of the world.

Yeah how dare he not believe. HAVE SOME FAITH PETER!!

Damn, you're salty. I'll make sure to include you in my next joke.

You know nothing Jon Snow.
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:21:13
If openbazaar is decentralized, effectively cutting out the middle man. How would developing this software stand to make them money? Aren't they the middlemen in the standard example such as ebay?
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:07:09
esports seems pretty popular among those interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:39:29
he can't.
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:30:28
At least he can keep those sick promo pics. His PR team really should have done more with those. I mean the one where hes writing on a glass board. My god if that isn't satoshi I don't know who is.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:59:13
Assange where?
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:08:16
The talk linked says 


too bad Craig's Alma mater has no record of him ever being a student there...
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:45:50
Because the burden of proof is on him. He's the one making claims.
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:16:39


Except you know, the people supporting/voting for him.
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:18:29
The access he doesn't have? Awesome!
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:04:39


So this whole situation is unrealistic? Are we all in a dream? Because it seems like someone had the confidence to pull off this heist in the first place...
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:27:34
the original paper wasn't written in LaTeX and it wasn't uploaded to arXiv. pdfinfo says


and the fonts Century Schoolbook, Times New Roman, Arial, Courier don't make me think otherwise.
You can tell this by the poor typographic detail (for example, contrast how the letters 'fi' are typeset, and the spacing in the equations). Not to mention the pdf metadata.
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:21:14
Good concept. Making them different lengths seems kind of bad though. Would allow the attacker to effectively know when they are being duped by a duress account.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:56:38
Too busy with his pitch lol
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:40:42


what kind of services?
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:37:14
The whitepaper was NOT typeset in LaTeX - it was typeset in OpenOffice.org.
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:32:06


What allegations did he prove false?
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:37:13
The joke was not made for your enjoyment. I actually got more amusement out of the fact that it went over your head.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:30:38
Selling drugs, hacking and money laundering is punished harsher than murder. Seems logical.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:26:20
So you mean I'd pay for services when I actually use them? Sounds like a terrible system.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:52:38
Just because you have that opinion of him doesn't mean he's not a scammer.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:23:41
teach me senpai
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:23:13
And by that same merit if he is Satoshi you'd think he might send out a signed message or move some early coins. My opinion is that the real Satoshi had/has no desire to be the face of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:54:50
Lol can't take a joke?
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:09:07
Honestly if that's how its going to work the whole system is a joke. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:51:16
Why. He doesn't even use them? No need to give him commit rights he wont be using.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:31:48
I thought rights were something you are given, or expected to have. Not something that you have to claim or take.
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:12:16
Yeah, I guess I just have a hard time imagining how ebay would make money if they weren't taking a percentage.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:41:01
Odd that it took you this long to realize but ok!
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:57:15
Sounds like a great way to not move on with your life and instead cause yourself grief. Just cut your losses and live a happier life.
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:41:03


It's actually nothing like that. Terrible comparison.
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:48:05
So what does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:20:24


Those people destroyed their own lives.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:34:25
If he doesn't can you and other premature believers apologize and reimburse us for the time we have to spend refuting your stupid "proof"
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:24:11
They admitted to using sql injects to get to the server.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:42:05
truth, didn't realize this until I had a teacher with that last name. Now I hear it all the time.
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:05:43
What does snowden have to say about bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:37:44
It's hilarious that bitcoin people are here supporting a company holding someones funds unless he reveals exactly where the money came from. Shows how mainstream bitcoin actually is. Things weren't always like this, the prevailing attitude of the average bitcoin user is clearly quite different.
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:07:08
What if 10 people own that 1 satoshi? What do you split if there is nothing left?
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:55:13
Thanks man. You seem to be on a roll today. Keep up the good work chimp.
@_date: 2019-05-01 01:21:20


I asked for a source to learn about the information you are yelling at me for not knowing. How in the world is that me defending talking points? I asked a question to gain more knowledge and educate myself. This is ridiculous, I'm not sure why I'm even defending myself.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:32:04
Personally I would prioritize by # of social media followers. Bad press can run a company a lot more than $200,000.

Be sure to repeat this when they keep bothering  you about their losses.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:35:11
Great. So now your parents are interested because they think it will gain in value. Have fun explaining where their investment went if things take a dump.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:26:33
Ok??? That's the utility?
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:41:10
Because surely the cops are trolling the darknet looking for small time consumers.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:08:12


based almost entirely on speculation. 
Stocks which also deal with heavy speculation are also able to be "traded" for any currency in the world.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:28:13
HELLO MOTO
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:33:42
Personally I would prioritize by # of social media followers. Bad press can run a company a lot more than $200,000.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:44:21
Uh it's clearly still speculation. Unless you think bitcoin actually has utility..
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:12:35


Except you do...?
If you could buy/sell drugs with no risk then why aren't you doing it? Sounds like a money printing machine.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:05:23
Explain to me how

@_date: 2017-06-01 21:11:16
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:19:20
And as always, the concept of lowest hanging fruit is all you need to worry about if you're the average consumer.
