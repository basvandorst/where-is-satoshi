It's not about the size of the doge in the fight, it's about the size of the fight in the doge.

Buy the dip

Because they’re buying illegal drugs maybe. Personally I think sending btc is just as simple as using paypal or a debit card.

Most of the reputable coins have an all time high that’s about 3x the current price, I think this is how crypto is meant to be. It cant be a bull market all the time.

Cool now send me some bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:31:14
Lmao no you shouldnt feel bad, rules and regulations dont actually make something legit we just percieve it that way
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:18:44
Even if it went down to 5k I still wouldnt be nervous but that’s just me

Well said OP. I’m not sweating this.

Seems legit

Lmfao everyone was convinced that it couldnt fall below 6k and now that it has everyone has a crazy prediction for a new bottom. It just shows how stupid this reddit community actually is, myself included. None of us know shit!

Yea unfortunately I have to wait till friday to get my value off of coinbase, but I have a hardware wallet on standby

Pure speculation :)

My fam thinks crypto is fake internet nerd money, they dont deserve my btc

Long term holding will generate profits if the price keeps going up
Selling your btc at a high price and then buying again when the price dips down can make you even more money if you make good trades
