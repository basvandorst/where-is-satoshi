yeah seems to be back now, slow at first, but all seems well.

This has worked perfectly. Every 24hr period since I have seen max connections as high as 28 (20 in 8 out) and a max of 12gb uploaded data.

Awesome, thanks for the quick replies.
I've set the maxconnections to 28 and uploadtarget to 12500 which is roughly half of what they were both before, so I'll see how that goes over next few days.

Or instead of cashing out, you could come pay my business a visit  - we take bitcoins don't you know!

Many thanks for the kind comments, I'm glad you received your order so quickly, and that you're happy with it most of all!!
Yes you are right about the volatility of Bitcoin being a possible problem in the future, we are looking at integrating a Bitcoin payment button very soon, just need to get my head around it! 
I've looked at Litecoin, and I can say that it's something for the future! :)

I wish we stocked some mens trousers too!! :)
Unfortunately the organic, fairtrade sector is still pretty small for men, and the few companies there are will not supply us until we get a bit bigger, and others just have too big minimum wholesale order for us to buy from.
This will change soon enough, but for now, sorry we couldn't supply you with some trousers! :)

For my company I've simply set up a purchase order for each customer, and then put the payment option as Bitcoin.  It's not the difficult really, but like the others have said, you need to do more reading, as I don't think you fully understand Bitcoin as yet!

Hey BitcoinWife!
Yes the US delivery fee includes Hawaii, as it's included in the US states, and isn't a separate country! :)

Just wanted to say a massive Thank You to everyone who has ordered from our business wanting to pay via Bitcoins!
All orders have been dispatched and should be arriving on your doorsteps in a matter of days.
