The idea is for default wallet functionality to be:
1. Broadcast with underestimate fee.
2. If tx does not confirm, rebroadcast with higher fee.
3. Repeat step 2 until tx confirms or maximum acceptable fee is reached.
So we are reducing fees to the minimum the market truly accepts because of step 1.

This client by (AdamISZ) has a much more reliable sendpayment than the original joinmarket client as well.

That doesn't follow. 
Like I said it is maybe a 30% space increase over the next year. Even if you got all of that today there would still be a backlog of course.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:08:47
I expect on chain fees to continue to grow indefinitely. LN transaction fees are another matter though.
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:45:55
Even simply 2 transactions total. Start first transaction at 50% of current suggested fee. If first tx doesn't confirm after 3 blocks then rebroadcast at 100% current suggested fee.
If many wallets did this it would reduce fees for everyone.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:17:59
Ok well the long term and more complex idea is for wallets to implement a minimum fee system that takes advantage of replace-by-fee. [A similar or the same idea is mentioned here.](
Basically your wallet sends a minimum fee and if your transaction doesn't confirm then you re-send using a higher fee using replace-by-fee.
By doing this you would force those fake bids you mentioned out of the market (lest the fake bidders lose money).
You also get a real minimum fee paid as sometimes your transaction does confirm before you resend with RBF at a higher fee.
Mining fees start at a minimum and bid up over time to a user defined (or wallet auto-chosen) maximum fee, producing a more efficient and transparent fee market.
In a world where we use Lightning, RBF sends to a lightning channel removes the problem of someone having to wait for your confirm and not wanting to see an RBF transaction from you (since no one needs to trust your 0-conf transaction).

I did overlook hardware wallets. This is still solvable of course, but you are right.
It is a matter of building a wallet that has feature "auto magic fee bumping transactions" and then it is separately up to Trezor to implement support for wallets that use magic-bumping, so that the Trezor only asks for permission once.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:59:51
If that is happening then we could harm those miners by setting fees  below the average transaction fee, causing those fake bidders to pay fees that they didn't really want to pay, to other miners.

Transactions such as the ones that joinmarket makes are reduced in size by about 20-30%, according to the biggest joinmarket code contributor.
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:47:07
It needs to be an automated process where the wallet rebroadcasts with a higher fee after x time, until the tx confirms. Not something the user needs to monitor and spend time on.
This allows the wallet to start with a very low fee, and find the minimum needed fee to get a confirm.

There were unfazed people who held (and lost) millions on MtGox.
Currently you don't own any bitcoins, you just own Coinbase-Bitcoin-IOUs.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:41:32


Not true. RBF rebroadcasting solves this by starting with a too low fee and then increasing and rebroadcasting the tx until it confirms.
Doesn't require predicting the future.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:24:00
I agree except for:


As long as they are not in a logical order then you are secure.
If you are forming sentences though then you are drastically reducing the search space and you are going to have a bad time.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:31:46
It seems like you both said the same thing to me so far. I guess you think that LN wont reduce fees and confirmation times. Though I don't think you said that, so I'm just guessing.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:12:18
So it appears that you two agree then.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:46:39


Then they should RBF rebroadcast the transaction with a higher fee if it doesn't confirm after 1 block passes.
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:31:18


Not true. Their power is limited by the client software that validates blocks that miners broadcast.


This is not true. Bitcoin client software would reject blocks that included a transaction that spent illegally like that.
Miners having less power only strengthens your other points though :)

My point is that you should think for yourself, not mindlessly become comfortable because of the decision of some friend.
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:45:11


It can be solved using RBF rebroadcasting.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:28:39
It is an effective increase in transaction space. And it was claimed many times to be this. 
Widespread use of segwit transactions will provide up to effectively about 90% larger block size (but realistically I expect maybe only 30% more in a year or so).
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:56:15
Oh, really? I remember sendpayment.py (with around 3 makers joined in the transaction) on original joinmarket often not completing for me and it being much better in your fork, but maybe that is a coincidence or something that has been fixed since then in original joinmarket.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:25:34


And if another miner mines your transactions then you pay them a butt load of fees, or if your fees paid were low then other miners don't mine your transactions and you didn't impact the network.
If all miners are doing this then we would be able to tell by seeing either many low fee transactions being mined or by seeing many transactions not visible in our mempools getting into blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:54:32
Yes but in that case:


@_date: 2017-08-28 01:42:41


You don't need to ask the user about rebroadcasting when you do it. The transaction you rebroadcast either confirms or doesn't, it isn't like you can lose funds or anything.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:44:24


I wasn't talking about mining software, I was talking about client wallet software.
Users software will reject a block if miners use rules that dont follow what their client agrees with. This is what causes a hard fork, and is the reason that BCH and BTC require different clients. And is the reason a miner can't just include a transaction that spends coins that they don't have the keys to.

You can't make a GPU only algo. You can create an ASIC for any algo, if you spend the resources needed to do so.

The link he gave doesn't appear to show that. How did you come to that conclusion?
I see from his link that there are 1675 addresses that hold 40% of the coins. Keep in mind that some of those addresses are exchange addresses that hold coins owned by tens of thousands of people. And some of those addresses may not even be active anymore (lost private key or owner is dead, etc).

I don't understand why so many people recommend breadwallet. I have had many bad experiences with new users trying this for the first time.
The main issue is that it only connects to 3 nodes and gets sandbox attacked easily, stopping your transaction from getting broadcast. This is a rare problem usually (but only has to happen to a new user once to destroy their trust), and it is a common problem if you use a public VPN.
A secondary issue with breadwallet is that it has a huge privacy problem in that it leaks your balance to the nodes it connects to, for everyone to see.
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:39:43
Can't tell if you are joking.
- We will never run out of addresses.
- You can't sell addresses since no one would want an address that someone else knows the private key to.

In version 1. They fixed that in version 2.
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:24:56
He didn't.
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:22:08
What he means is that Jihan is preventing Segwit, which would increase transaction space.

Are you not the one that added "THANKS_BLOCKSTREAM" to the post URL?
I assumed at first that you were writing it sarcastically (like "Thanks Obama!") but then you said "Credit where credit's due" so now I have no idea what your opinion actually is here.
