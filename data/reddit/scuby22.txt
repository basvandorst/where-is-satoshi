My friend just had a baby, I wanted to give his son a gift of bitcoins that he would get on his 18th birthday.  What is the best long term way to give someone bitcoins?

If I create a paper wallet with bip38 encryption, is there any chance that I won't be able to easily decrypt it later (say 10-20 years) because software will not be able to import/validate because the encryption will have moved to a newer standard?

It's because the government views bitcoins as money - therefore, the regulatory agencies that control money want to impose their regulations.

He's clearly taken more ~~bribes~~ campaign contributions from the ~~coal~~ mining industry than the financial sector.  He should be embracing 21st century "mining" and supporting the bitcoin miners.

"Trivial to perform" - how would someone easily do this?  It seems like an awful lot of effort to double spend for a bottle of soda.  Is there an easier way I'm missing?

Funny enough... there was a bitcoin meetup in Afghanistan in July 2013... maybe the cab drivers in Kabul will join in soon:

If you give to a charity and they take it as USD (through bitpay, etc) then the value is easy.  If you gave to a charity and they accepted it as bitcoin, the value needs to be fixed to the exact moment in time when you gave it to them, right?  Otherwise you're getting involved in deduction arbitrage.

Firstrust is not a rinky dink bank, [Richard Green]( CEO and Owner of the bank is a billionaire, minority owner of the [Philadelphia Eagles]( (NFL Football Team), and a major force in Philadelphia.  Most of Firstrust's banking comes from real estate transactions and commercial banking, not the personal banking.  
They are an entrepreneurial bank that has done very well in the past decades.  I think the bitcoin community should be working to turn banks like this around (in the short term) to help bitcoin growth and new users. 
Either with a phone call or a letter, I think you should say something like this:
Dear Firstrust,
I'm in receipt of your letter dated December 2, 2013; Re: Account Activity.  I am a customer of Coinbase.com's currency conversion services.  Coinbase.com is currently one of the major US providers of converting US dollars into the Bitcoin currency.
Bitcoins are a growing digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services all over the world.  Coinbase and Bitcoins are both rapidly growing and providing their users with new and exciting ways to use, control, and spend their own money.
Recently, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently praised digital currencies like the Bitcoin to the Senate.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts predict Bitcoin, will become a "major means of payment for e-commerce" and a "serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers."  Here in Philadelphia, in our own backyard, a real estate company is accepting Bitcoins as payment on property (
I have been a customer in good standing with Firstrust and want to continue my business with Firstrust.  However, I would like free use of my money and purchases, if we cannot find common ground on this matter, I will be forced to find a new banking partner.  It is possible that I may be the first Firstrust customer to utilize Bitcoins, I assure you, it is a growing market in your customer base.  I urge Firstrust to learn about Bitcoin, and reconsider your stance regarding my purchases.
