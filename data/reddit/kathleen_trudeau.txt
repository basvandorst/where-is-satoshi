Insider trading is a non-crime

Why would you need fast and cheap transactions if both BTC and BCASH are used mostly for speculations?

There is lots of development on Ethereum blockchain. That makes significant difference.

So no source.

I don't like their Javascript like languages, blockchain rollbacks and the fact it is used primarily for speculations at the moment.

A false statement. Only idiots invest all their money into one class of assets. Everyone else diversifies. Rich people don't put all their money in stocks, gold, property, etc.

You are funny. What do you know about me and my investments to make any statements of this sort? Fuck off.

I am not rich and I diversify.

But no one uses it. It had a dead cat bounce because of Korean speculators recently.

No one speaks about real use of cryptos anymore. People don't give shit about applications it is all about moon, hodl, etc.
For instance, why ETC reached almost $20 few hours ago? People just look for 'undervalued' currencies and buy them then sell. Rinse and repeat.
Ethereum has one fiasco after another. Bitcoin is practically useless for making purchases. No one cares about Monero, ZCash and Ripple which are good pieces of technology. 
Before people would speak about crypto adoption and use in real life. Now it is all about price fluctuations.

I am not a racist. Because I don't judge what people deserve based on their skin color or genitals. However, that's not the case with the liberals in Canada.
I used to be homophobic, but I've been for more than a decade clean.

I don't have any respect for Roger Ver and other bcash people, but going to the meeting with the government and nagging about competing technology is so immature. Also it doesn't help credibility of cryptos.

LOL.

Reminds me classic car bubble. The technology cannot be used for its original purpose. Its going up together with alt coins which are even worse in terms of the practical use. 50 billions dollars pumped into crypto currencies market by speculators, people are buying just because they don't want to be left out. 
Creatores, miners and exchanges reap huge profits. I hope you don't invest more than you are ok loosing.

So how this eliminates merchant fraud?
