I joined the crypto currency craze in March but did enough research to realize that if BFL ever shipped, you'd be waaaaaaaaay to far down the line to brake even in your investment.  
GPU scrypt coins is where its at now.

This has been my exact question for the past two weeks now that I've finally paid attention to Bitcoins...I'm looking at it just as a hobby...little extra "cash" each month that I might use to pay for web hosting and what not. Kicking myself for not paying attention back in 2011 or so when they first hit my radar.
For now I'm hoping things will go well with litecoins as they were built to resist hardware advances and I'll still mine that.  Might deal with mining contacts as well too see how those work out.  
As time goes on those of us who simply used what we had lying around to mine will likely stop when GPUs aren't cutting it and leave the game up to the ASICs...  That'll "thin the herd" and those willing to invest in entry level ASICs (which might be a second generation by then) could still see profits over time.  I'd be happy with a break even at 6 months even.

They did mention (perhaps in an edit) that its a 5 GH/s.  Even so their lack of real research shows when he says
*"So most of the people who shelled out the $274 it costs for one of these systems back in June are still waiting."*
Anybody who's been following this BFL fiasco knows they were 149 for that model back in June then jumped in price in the past few weeks on the onset of their added press for shipping a handful of units.
That company is just shady as can be.
