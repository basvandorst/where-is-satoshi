in order to successfully sell it, someone has to buy it lol.. obviously people are buying BTC right now so it does some odd.  From what I hear, Coinbase doesn't have the best customer service, though.  Give it until morning to see if it goes through

Nothing, because Bitcoin isn't going to be used as a day-to-day currency.  It's more of a commodity now, anyway (like gold).  Smaller currencies that less resemble a commodity like ETH or LTC will more likely be used on things like groceries.

I guess it’s still up in the air at the moment but nobody is going to ask for 0.000001 BTC for a coffee lol and processing time and fees are basically nonexistent with LTC and ETH
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:47:45
I agree.  It's not a currency anymore.  It's a commodity (like gold)

Coinbase (the easiest to use.. download the mobile app!), GDAX, Bittrex, Poloniex
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:13:43
Yeah.  Were they implemented yet?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:14:58
Lol yeah, people should be killed for putting money into a coin that they believe in.  Good thing I just sold and profited 10x what I put into Ripple while you probably bought bitcoin at an all time high you dumbfuck

Lol dogecoin is the biggest pump and dump alt coin out there
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:09:09
What? Lol.. I transferred bitcoin from Coinbase to Poloniex to buy an altcoin and was charged $32 to move $310 worth of BTC.  The fees are absurdly high and there are way better coins now that are faster and cheaper.  Bitcoin’s tech is becoming obsolete.  Confused how that relates to turning $50 into a million

Coin Ticker and Coin Market Cap

Lol you are ignorant if you think Ripple is a sl”shit coin”.  Bitcoin’s fees and long transaction times will cause it’s intrinsic value to become under $10k.  Ripple actually has a purpose and solves a problem

Bc you need a powerful enough GPU to be able to mine, and even then it’s tough.  Bitcoin mining is basically a competition
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:24:45
$0, unless the engineers somehow fix the ridiculous fees and long transaction times
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:04:47
Yeah :( Different exchanges have different prices but it’s the only one I found when I first got into crypto so I have my portfolio in there already 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:06:15
Yeah, it can.  But it won’t lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:54:56
neeeeeeddddd pretty please!!!!!!

you’ll be sleeping for some time
