You are just crazy and a victim of your paranoid world in which only friend and enemy exist. Guys like you are the enemy of a free society and the death of every project, because they drown the flow of thought with their narrow view of the world. There is nothing in the world of any time that made the world a better place when people of your mindset have been in any kind of charge. People like you are the reason why bitcoin is about to fail. But yeah, project it to me or Roger or whoever. 
You know, **I wrote an article about Lightning, and now rbtc is embarassed about my lightning shilling**. But yeah, try to make me an enemy because I entertain freedom of mind. 
Goodbye. Once I found you interesting.Now you are just a poor pathetic fanatic.

Are you accusing me of getting money to post here?

Sorry. Going to rbitcoin and complaing about c*** [1] after your comment on a blog of bitcoin-dot-com was manually approved *is* a stroke of dignity, if you'd know or not. Now you know. 
[1] guess why your comment showed up four hours after you submitted it? Which word did trigger the delay?

We misunderstood. With [1] I meant your comment HERE. I just get an information 4 hours after you submitted it, which means it was manually approved. This is done by a list of keywords, and now guess what keyword triggered it?
This adds to the irony of your post.

Thank you Bruce!

Oh, now it is allowed to talk about the c-word?
Hehe, every news website has an automated system selecting which comments need to be manuelly approved. You really need to be dispaired to call this "cens..."
I can't believe it. Get some dignity.

As I said, it is standard for most blogs to have a manual approval of comments. Thanks to trolls and briganeers. Did you excuse by the bitcoincotdom-stuff for your wrong accusation?
Ah, I guess no, as you don't understand the difference between comment approvals on a magazine and massive c*** on a public forum.
