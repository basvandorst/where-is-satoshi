I am serious about donating.  I need to learn how to safely send bitcoins.  Receiving them is rather easy. :)  I'm going to download [electrum]( and get started.  Who is matching the donations?  Are you guys a registered non-profit?
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:41:14
I know, I'm flipping here, plus Auburn won on a miracle.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:33:42
It wasn't and I am blown away!  I thought maybe a few would notice and send a bit or two.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:49:54
Anymore I receive I will donate to Sean's Outpost.
I'm putting an end to this madness!

Thanks, I'll look into it.  I generated the vanity wallet offline.  Super paranoid about some keylogger on any PC that's ever touched the internet.  Now the trick is to make good on my word without screwing this up!

Never in my life have I been so famous.  I guess this is my 15 minutes worth!!!!  What does vote brigaded mean?
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:41:03
I'm tipping Daniel and donating to [Sean](
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:38:46
I'm flipping speechless!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:26:23
Auburn just won, I'm taking my sign to Toomer's corner!!!!

 I'm paying taxes.  It's the right thing to do whether or not I get caught. And if/when I get Dox, IRS will PWN me.

I'm blown away by your generosity. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:31:45
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:22:41
That was a throwaway.  I've lost the password on that one.  This is a throwaway as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:32:25
Nope, anymore I get I am donating to feed the homeless.  I'll send it Tuesday when I get my breath back!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:22:30
I'm blown away!
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:30:17
Thanks DanielTaylor!  I love you, in a we're just friends kinda way!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:48:25
Not really.  I think the big money rolled in because I said that.  Now it will go to a good cause.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:11:01
It's gonna be big, I think. :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:33:48
My mom will not hear about this!
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:27:23
Thank you, I'm still floored by all this.  Now off to learn how to send bitcoins.  Rx'ing is easy! :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:44:18
I'm flattered.  My wife called me a nerd.  She doesn't know about the 22 BTC yet!
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:38:42
I know, right?  Fight the power!  But, I could get into some serious hot water if I getted dox'ed and IRS comes knocking.  As soon as I send the money to Sean, taxable event for Uncle $am.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:01:47
Top 10 bitcoin post ... I'm blushing now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:39:45
It's legit and I am floored by the outpouring!
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:24:55
Blown away!
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:33:02
It was to me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:43:25
Still a taxable event.  
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:14:48
I'm glad I didn't pick the "to the moon guy"!  :P
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:34:34
What game are you developing?
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:43:57
Thanks!  I so didn't expect this to take off.  I thought, if I get lucky, someone will send me a bit or two as a gag!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:22:55
Just called my dad to share the good news!  I told him its the power of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:07:56
Not a bitcoin millionaire.  I read about bitcoins on Slashdot couple years back, did nothing.  April 2013 bubble had me take a second look.  Bought a bitcoin in July for $101 to get my feet wet and see what all the talk was about.  Watched it grow rapidly and thought about the sign as a joke not thinking it would work.  from Europe used GIMP to decode the blurry image.  He's getting a tip to an address he PM'ed me.  I'll be making a donation to Sean's Outpost as soon as I can work out all the tax implications.   Hopefully before Monday when the matching offer ends.  In the mean time, someone told me I need to learn how to use Electrum.  That's next on my radar.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:37:16
I plan on sending two transactions.  One to Sean's Post, one to Daniel Taylor.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:10:44
I made it with a vanity generator on an offline computer.  I have the public and private key.  No software is currently managing the wallet and its not online anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:04:12
I thought that statement would cool things down, but "its like adding gasoline to a flame."  
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:47:32
Exactly, but my net income just went up $26000!  My FIL is a tax guru, we'll discuss.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:28:22
DanielTaylor rocks my world!  I wasn't sure it was going to be clear enough!!!!    I love that man!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:34:18
It wasn't supposed to take off like this!!!  
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:39:02
I rolled Toomer's corner after I threw out my voice!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:07:46
It is.  I had no idea it would take off like this.  First, I wasn't even sure that the code would be scannable.  2nd, I was too far away from the Game Day cameras.  I worked my way to 5th row back and lined myself between the talking heads of Corso and &lt;someone I don't know&gt;.   Thanks again!!!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:01:40
I really don't need anymore!
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:17:05
I'm still learning how to use bitcoins, I've read horror stories about changes wallets.  I used a vanity bitcoin wallet generator 
I was blown away by the outpouring!  Donation to DanielTaylor and Seans Outpost as soon as I learn how to send bitcoins safely!  I heard you had to spend all the bitcoins out of a wallet?!
Edit: And I haven't the slightest clue regarding the tax implications!
