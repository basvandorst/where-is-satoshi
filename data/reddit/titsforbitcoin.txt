Hello Giszmo, do you mind explaining how the tipping fucntion was broken? If you were signed in with credits you should be able to tip - if you like you can just let us know your username and Coinbase transaction confirmation number and we will happily investigate this issue for you...
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:31:04
we have deleted this model.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:19:58
hi guys - we are migrating from boobsforbitcoin.com to our new site at titsforbitcoin.com - we already have dozens of girlsgonebitcoin girls signed up, we are just in process of migrating them to the new site so stay tuned ;)
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:35:06
you might like our site  ;)

This is the reason the tip button was greyed out and you could not chat, whilst you can see the models as a guest, you cannot chat as a guest.
One does not simply walk into Mordor

in fact there is a 0.05 BTC referral fee for anybody who succesfully refers a new cam girl to  visit the site for more details
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:50:47
were you logged in? did you have credits?
@_date: 2014-01-13 17:21:49
Yes BTC transaction  - apologies for poorly composed title. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:16:59
For the record - we decided to remove this cam from the site, due to a few user complaints. We will shower girls in public rooms with the BTC that was collected so all users benefit
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:30:19
we launched  not long ago :)
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:16:03
thanks turbo, quite worrying - tiny transactions are quick, then big ones, not so. Not fun!
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:01:27
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:37:52
All models have now been paid.
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:30:51
Our camgirls don't even have to be online to receive their anonymous tips either. Amazing! We think this is probably a first in the cam world
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:11:13
There is no way to ask them.
I see no mention of this on their website. How long is long? We have payments to make and cam girls to pay.
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:44:19
Currently taking submissions for new names. Post them here. :)
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:46:55
Thanks for the positive feedback! We are continually adding new girls so make sure to check back - they do need to sleep sometimes though ;)
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:01:14
Hi Paige - we have now updated the payment system so that it is now automatic - no need for users to submit an email or username anymore.
We do recommend they keep a copy of their confirmation number.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:01:03
we are investigating this claim and will take appropriate action
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:55:18
yes, thats right it is completely anonymous! 
@_date: 2014-02-05 12:56:24
So with this mind-set we should ban cash as well?
Or has cash never been used to fund a drug deal that ended in an overdose?
A very sad story, but Bitcoin is not the problem. The laws are the problem.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:04:09
For the record our Coinbase payment finally went through - thank you Coinbase.
We are going to send payments through on a Sunday to ensure this hold-up will not affect us in the future.
Thanks for your patience. We will begin model payouts starting immediately.
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:18:35
We apologise for the double post. Will not happen again. We have set up an advertising campaign with Reddit. Thanks
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:28:17
BellaCandi is now live anyway ;)
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:14:14
Perhaps they should remove "will be confirmed in about 1 hour " from their site then.
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:14:33
all existing models keep 100% earnt Bitcoin until 2015 (must be registered prior to todays date).
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:19:05
strip4bit.com is nothing like us :)
We will only have verified cam girls, we remove fake cams from the site immediately, as we did today.
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:39:53
No, you do not have to be a female to be a model, all are welcome :)
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:15:47
actually we do - the girls submit photos much like girlsgonebitcoin - we are working to make this tighter.
@_date: 2014-11-09 03:51:05
Whilst we do use Coinbase for BTC transactions we have never had a problem.
Of course that is not the way to approach it just because our past says we have never had a problem.
If I were you, I would wait until at least 3 confirmations if you are concerned. 
Then if the confirmations fail, simply deduct the credit amount from your relevant users account.
For those that are interested you can see how it works at titsforbitcoin.com [NSFW]

 - 100% of our cam girl live streams are purchased with Bitcoin. We are also the most secure Bitcoin cam girl site on earth. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:07:01
You are correct, that site has been around for a while, its catered more to professional studio cam girls and takes a hefty fee from the girls - our site at titsforbitcoin.com sends 100% of the Bitcoin to the girls at the moment, and we are catering more to the girlsgonebitcoin type girl - the girl next door so to speak ;)
@_date: 2014-01-11 11:49:24
For the record we have been receiving feedback from our users on all of the cam girls - any suspected fake cams are reported to us very quickly and investigated and dealt with just as quick - we will not put up with fake cams on our site, ever.
Thanks for all of your suggestions and ideas to help continue make our service even better. We have taken it all on board and are making appropriate changes.
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:25:05
We are only a few weeks old - check back later.
Sometimes there are 4 girls online, sometimes there are none, but we are growing :)
Plenty of girls from GGBC do shows with us regularly
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:32:31
There is always this risk with any cam site - we will be monitoring the situation closely and take the appropriate action.
In the meantime it would be best to only tip models with a gallery thumbnail, as these photos can only be submitted using a physical webcam, for this very purpose, and these girls are 100% verified.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:07:33
can you provide the link to the MFC cam please?
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:37:51
great to hear jake - keep mentioning it to those mfc girls ;)
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:31:56
oh im sorry. i must have read the text on their site that reads "will be confirmed in about 1 hour "
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:44:32
That is correct, you need to be logged in and have purchased credits in order to tip a girl. You can chat with the girl for free though, unlike other sites.
Flash media streaming is expensive - we have 1000s of connections a day and need to maintain the site, hosting, advertising. So I am sorry to hear that this service is not for you.
In any case, a user that does purchase credits to tip models can have a 100% refund of unused credits at anytime, no questions asked.
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:21:53
Our users definitely enjoyed your shows AnabelleLeigh, see you again soon hopefully :)
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:13:13
Thanks - we have been in contact - Coinbase have replied and the transaction has gone through. Thank you Coinbase and everyone that made suggestions here.
@_date: 2014-01-11 13:42:16
This was the submission (NSFW)
