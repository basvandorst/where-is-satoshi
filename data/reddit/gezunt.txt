You start off with fake flawed english and then end up with perfect English.  You didn’t even try to keep up the act.

It clearly says they leveraged their partners like bitfinex during that period of time.
And of course you’re a buttcoin user.  Jesus.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:22:44
Another buttcoin user to rescue the conspiracy.  You people are shit.

Why would a bank need to know about your political leanings?

Who is attacking gold?

Where can I read about what they log?
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:55:29
Open terminal.app and type 
ls /var/log

I have no reason to and if I did have a reason the last thing I would want to do is mix my coins with a bunch of other people who also have a reason to mix their coins.

Check /var/log for a file called prey.log

“No one” get the fuck out of here with this contrived bullshit.
@_date: 2019-10-01 10:53:35
It’s a typo.  It should be “ourselves”.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:44:48
If it’s not confirmed it’s not spent.

That guy does nothing but talk shit.

Bitcoin will never be over.  Supply and demand dictates that the price will increase over time.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:23:38
It makes no sense to do an on chain transaction for Coinbase to Coinbase transactions and the 72 hour wait has nothing to do with solvency.
@_date: 2019-12-05 10:15:33
That’s not double spending.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:50:31
You are not intelligent.

Even if he doesn’t he has started the UBI discussion and it’s not going away.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:53:29
You never answered my question.  You deflected with bs.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:39:27
Sure attack me for pointing out the flaws in your dumb conspiracy theory.  Get a life.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:09:21
Bitmain should hire english speakers for its advertising.
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:45:10
One of your major arguments is that Coinbase to Coinbase transactions are off chain.  So explain why it would make any sense for them to do it on chain.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:23:22
Things like price and hashrate are reflections of its overall success.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:43:36
You need to be an adult to buy bitcoin.

He can use XMR.to for the conversion there is no kyc.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:04:55
I measure it in profit and customer loyalty and I’ve seen no evidence of either.  Just the fact that you didn’t mention the company name and we all knew who you were talking about should show you the negative impact they’ve had on this space.  The devs are focusing on other layers for scaling and bitpay can compile their own shit if they don’t like it.  We literally would not miss them if they closed shop.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:56:56
Are you talking about bitpay?  A company that has removed choice.  A company I haven’t heard a positive word about in years.  A company that should be compiling their own binaries anyway.  
How are you measuring their “success”?  Do they publish financial statements somewhere?
@_date: 2019-09-28 07:20:09
This is sexist.
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:52:41
If you use XMR.to for the XMR to BTC conversion there is no kyc.
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:39:24
No one uses it.  You still have the choice and if you’re planning to accept payments you should be doing everything possible to secure your shit and removing trust, like compiling your own binaries.  I bought wow classic gold the other day using my own wallet and it went great.
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:44:32
People aren’t buying and selling bitcoin on bakkt, they are betting on what the price will be.

Forever?
