“Not even proper English.” That is not a complete sentence and also not proper English lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:31:52
Still not shocking

Tell that to people in Zimbabwe

Just wanted to point out, “shocking” and “big fucking taxes” = your normal income tax

Your original comment just sounded like a teenager looking at his first pay stub

Interesting, so btc is deflationary?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:25:12
Just a billionaire flexing his nuts and being a dick
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:40:20
short term gains tax is the same rate as your normal income tax

Someone here apparently cares about $250 lol.
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:02:23
250 bitcoins or $250? For it to turn into 300k it’s either have to go down 98% or up 1,200x, respectively. That’d be either $1,200 a coin or $18M haha so retarded every way you look at it.

When you start combining volitility, momentum, and trends of the different coins to trade between 3 coins in a second and come out the other end with a .2% gain, I’m stoked. It’s like investing mixed with roulette mixed with lighting bets and crack. I love it

Eating up this bullshit most likely

Yeah, The Bureua of Engraving and printing isn’t a government entity. /s

Every asset class down 18% against BTC. Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:48:41
But then playing stupid always works. Didn’t warren buffet get away with the “I didn’t know I couldn’t do that” defense?
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:59:28
So like... doing meth, but just every once in a while?

This was is why owning stock in companies that buy politicians is where it’s at. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:57:55
The bureau of printing and engraving prints the money
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:39:34
So Bitcoin got short squeezed?
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:36:59
No, you just need a checkbook. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 06:22:01


I’m assuming by price you mean interest rate. Getting better interest rate from a bank vs dealership is almost guaranteed in the US.


Which is why the dealership didn’t run a credit check, the bank did.
I see zero reasons for BTC being necessary to make buying a car easier. OP is most likely slightly autistic. Calling his bank and doing a wire transfer was also a possible solution but that didn’t occur to him. Apparently he thinks wire transfers are only possible with BTC.

When you buy a car and put a down payment down, you’re also getting credit. Since you’re putting a down payment down means that they’ve extended you some type of credit. If you secured an auto loan from a bank you’d be paying for the whole car at once and owing the bank. This means the car dealership ran a credit check on you. They will take a check. We’re not talking about buying a soda at a gas station. I just bought a car last year and wrote a check for the down payment. It was fine and I was able to use my money when I needed it.
