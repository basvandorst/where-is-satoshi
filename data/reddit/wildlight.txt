Bitcoin will inflate for like 150 years nefore it reaches its full supply.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:30:59
So whos transactions would i route?
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:13:15
How ironic.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:11:09
Wow, thats cool. So ill only need to open one channel though right? Like with my exchange, and then what they just pay me a fee every time i send a transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:45:40
Pretty sure you should think of it the other way around. Its like depositing cash into your checking account from the block chain, only with the privilege of paying only $15 or higher fee every time you do so.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:08:46
Wow thats such a good idea, its perfect, cant believe anyome ever thought wed need a block larger then 1mb. I got an idea, what if once transaction fees are so low on bitcoin because no one even uses its blockchain anymore we just pay users to put a transaction on the blockchain. Just a really small amount, but then we can really laugh at those bcash idiots claiming their fees are so low when we have negative fees.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:36:09
You actually were the one that contradicted yourself. If high fees is really what miners care about, then core is what they should mine. Fees are almost non existent on bitcoin cash, so there must be other incentives for miners then just being able to extract the highest fee possible oer transaction. Like transaction volume and block size, or maybe just overall functionality.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:05:17
Theres virtually no fees on bitcoin cash, so im not sure how you can argue that miners support bch because they wanted higher fees. If you're concerned with collecting higher fees backing core as a miner would be the way to go.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:31:54
Well it works, on top if that all the same scaling solutions being developed for core will also be able to work for cash. Theres really now down side to 8mb blocks, it should scale easily for a few years and allow other scaling solutions to be developed in the mean time, and its not such a huge block size if you really think thats a big issue that it will be impossible to handle. The most important thing is that its ability to function exists even as its development continues. Its funny that people act as though supporting bigger blocks by pointing out the white paper is some kind of stubborn uncompromising position based on ideology, when its actually just the practical and most elegant approach, it just also happens to line up with satoshi's origiinal concept, but thats because he actually thought this all out really well.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:44:20
Well theres an argument against segwit as well, just like the block block size. I think the key argument against segwit is how it impacts miners. While, fast cheap along with happy miners seems like a pretty good win win all around. But youre right thats certainly an obstacle to creating off chain scaling solutions, luckily theres now time to come up with solutions without depending on a congested network.

At this point it seems like moving forward as consumers there must be a demand to be able to independently audit our funds deposited on any exchange at anytime. Anything less should be considered unacceptable.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:09:06
I don't think they bother to tell when you make a transaction. If you make a purchase what is the point of informing you that you did so? If your account is set to notify you when your transaction is complete and that is not happening then yes, that is an issue. Wait and see if you get a notification when the BTC is deposited to your account and test if it works when you withdraw them. The transaction should still show up in your history on your account as soon as you place an order and a hacker would have a hard time breaking into your account, placing an order, waiting for it to clear and withdrawing the money without you noticing. As long as you have 2FA and deposit/withdraw confirmations set up. If you have a strong password and you don't keep your bitcoins on coinbase for very long there's little to fear.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:11:24
I'd say its more of a case people are to invested to speak truthfully. I'm mostly talking about this ridiculous posts of Chinese rumors. But even news like neo and bee I just can't read anything without having to being so skeptical that I write it off.

I'm wondering if DAO's can find a way to comply with state laws or if they will simply have to bypass the existing system again. Maybe people will have warmed up to the idea by the time they are available.
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:20:54
there's @_date: 2014-04-29 06:59:56
It seems possible DAOs could find a way to be fully compliant with current laws, if the up front costs meeting compliance can be sorted out. Maybe they could start out in something like shipping, or warranties. If they can prove to be effective there the model could eventually expand into other things till it can hit large markets like healthcare or vehicle insurance.

I started at square negative 10 with him. I moved into my first apartment in 2008 and since then I've watched the cost of living nearly double. Mainly food and rent. Maybe I noticed these things more because my dad's business tanked and my parents lost their house but honestly you'd have to be pretty privileged to not notice. If you can understand the fundamentals of bitcoin and you can't see why it is potentially so valuable it probably is because of privilege.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:49:23
I see your point and I appreciate your prospective. I think its really all in good fun and harmless as long as some of us stay grounded. One of the things about bitcoin is we are all in this together, maintaining an optimistic outlook helps us all reinforce the collective delusion that our money has value which is the key to success. Since money is nothing more than an abstraction or an illusion of wealth it only works as long as we all collectively agree agree that it does. We are bankers, all of us and we want everyone to be bankers with us. 
I disagree that no one would spend their bitcoins as the price rises, as we all understand spending them is critical to a health ecosystem. The value will rise as growth increases and we have all the room in the world to grow. Of course we must all do our due diligence and support our fledgling economy. Success for any of us is success for all, this is a mutual endeavor for us all.
Now at the same time it is important that we also maintain a rational, sceptical and objective outlook at the same time. Therefore it is just as important to have those of us like your self reminding us that this is not a game and that we must not forget the stakes. So continue to be be smart and careful and help keep us grounded, but there is no reason we cannot at the same time enjoy our success and reinforce the collective delusion that gives our money its value.

@_date: 2014-02-25 07:20:52
Absolutely right. We must demand transparency and the ability to audit the funds stored on any exchange or other bitcoin service. Connivence can not be an excuse to not use the most secure services that give us the most control over our money. Is that not why most of us are here anyways, too have control over our money, Mt.Gox is not different that banks or government taking advantage of us, let this be a lesson learned.

I see gyft has wholefoods on their site, but I don't want to buy the premium shop there, I'm looking for something like safeway, costco, or vons, even trader joe's would be useful. I'd spend bitcoins on a weekly basis if I could get that option. I don't have anything like a computer or tablet I want to part with bitcoins for right.
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:19:18
I'm not really worried about getting notifications when an order is placed, I want to know when the money hits my account though so I can withdraw it as quickly as possible, and I also want a confirmation when money leaves my account. Neither of those have been an issue though. I can check my bank account to make sure I placed a transaction if I wanted to.

You're your own bank with bitcoin, if you want to make money you have to put it to work and pick your own investments. This is a high risk investment if you want a safe return sell your bitcoins and put the cash in a savings account. I'm not sure you'll really be making any money though because the low interest in a savings account is pretty much offset by inflation.

What is wrong with organizing? Why can a group of Developers and experts get together to address these issues in a way that helps the media get the store right and people don't have to not know what's going on with their money. You are not thinking long term here, bitcoin is going to be successful because it is transparent and empowering, increasing that is only helpful. Organization within the industry is bitcoin running on its own, its naturally what's going to happen, it can either be people organizing to exploit others and co opt whatever they can or to increase transparency and access for everyone.

@_date: 2014-03-10 08:33:04
What we need is an accessible way for people to produce an income. Since mining didn't work out the way it was intended originally the creation of bitcoins is fairly centralized which makes the only way for most to get their hands on them is through buying them. What we need is a really low barrier to entry service people can provide and accept bitcoins through.
My thought is a decentralized rideshare application kind of like lyft or uber. Rideshares are already very disruptive in their industries a bitcoin rideshare with no central third party would be very much in the spirit of bitcoin and would give anyone with a vehicle anywhere in the world the opportunity to make a bitcoin income.
I'm sure there are other services like this that could generate completely new business models that can bypass most of the old economy. This idea seems pretty solid to me though. I wish I had the skills to start turning it into an open source project.

@_date: 2014-02-09 14:49:35
I find the security of my money very valuable. the interesting thing is that because competition for mining is so high but the demand for miners is also very high theres a huge incentive for anyone to find a valuable use for miners and divert their efforts to some other purpose, so your issue will resolve itself as soon as its marketable. In the future miners will be used for what ever is the most profitable purpose which of course will be whatever is most valuable to society or the owner of the hardware. its totally possible their use could be completely decentralized and the owner might not even know for what purpose his/her hardware is being used for, just that the miner is computing whichever task ordered was the most profitable the moment it was finished its previous task.
i think it is possible other industries like 3d printing or shipping/transportation (particularly if shipping and transportation are automated) will wind up working the same way, this is much easier to do because of blockchain technology.
another thing to consider is that tradition banks take quite a lot of resources to operate as well. not just hardware and electricity. bitcoin has the long term advantage that the electricity of mining can eventually be converted to mainly self sufficient solar sources and have practically zero impact, a traditional bank could never reduce its consumption of resources that low.

Well hopefully decentralized exchanges become available sooner than later but I think there will be assurance with fully auditable exchanges in the near future. It is already the direction things seem to be headed. With that there will also soon be more options available like the growing ATM market. I do think that it is very important that people do not choose convenience over security, transparency and control over their money. Is that not why bitcoin is superior to the current banking system?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:12:50
There's certainly better alternatives. It is bazzar people were still using it long before they halted withdrawals. Absolutely no one should place convenience over security, transparency and control over their money. An exchange is not a safe place to store money, it is for exchanging no one should be using them as a wallet. Bitcoin is a way to have more control over your money, giving up that control by storing it on an exchange only gives the opportunity for someone else to lose your money. Isn't that why we are removing out money from the current system, to have more control and be safe from manipulation?

I still find it difficult to spend bitcoin on the things I'd like, I'm not interested in buying frivolous electronics, or furniture though I could dump all my bitcoins on those things, I'm more interested in supplementing my regular expenses with my gains and increasinly converting more of my income into bitcoin month to month. I'm also going to be really cautious about doing that, but so far the trouble has been being able to spend them where I'd like to so I'm likely to mainly hold untill I can do so and only make very small purchases over time. I thinknits possible with a few years it could be as convienet as anything else to use at which point I won't have the issues I do now.

The market cap is arbitrary and doesn't really matter. Its just an indicator used to make a valuation, it doesn't actually reflect the total value of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:35:27
If you ignore all of the negative aspects for a moment and focus on the fact that Bitcoin lets you make a transaction to anywhere in the world in a matter of seconds for a tiny fraction of what it costs today with no third party, and no ability for anyone to stop you from making that transaction. Then consider that all its shortcomings today are in no way permeant because its just software that can continuously be improved as needed, ask yourself what kind of potential does that tool have? The ability to send any amount of money anywhere, to anyone, instantly, for very little cost with out the fear that anyone for any reason can prevent your transaction from taking place. 
It doesn't matter if right now its risky, not user friendly, or has an unclear value. All those problems are finite and at its core Bitcoin has the potential to solve not only its own short comings but many of those of our current financial system. The technology exists its not going anywhere, so if it has any real potential to change things on a global scale do you want to be figuring it out as the main stream adopts it or would you rather be ahead of the curve and adapt is it evolve from its beginning?

I don't really trust any of the insiders in any way right now, but we don't know what they may or may not know, So we'll just have to wait and see if someone tells us something. There's supposed to be an update from blockchain at 7:00 AM. Don't know the time zone.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:29:35
Crypto currencies are all written in open source code, that is for the sake of transparency, no one wants to store their money in a system that they can't see the way it works and can't be audited, hence the demand for bitcoin in the first place. We know how secure bitcoin is because the code has be reviewed hundreds or thousands of time, anyone can look at it. Same is true for other crypto currencies, anyone that didn't use open source code would not be trusted. Because of this features built into other currencies can easily be adapted if useful and valuable enough. it still possible for some feature to never be compatible with bitcoin, say a coin with permanent inflation built into it, bitcoin is deflationary it couldn't adopt that feature.
Ethereum as i understand it, which admittedly is not that well, has features bitcoin cannot have, mainly it has a scripting language built into it that allows anyone to program autonomous contracts of any complexity right into its block chain. However the way it works is include fees into most of the interactions on the block chain, where as bitcoin can process transaction with zero fees. i may be incorrect here. because of the heavier use of fees over time storing money on ethereum is likely to cost more than the zero cost of storing your bitcoins.
I don't care to rationalize my speculative view that I believe the price will continue go up, but i do believe we are likely within 2 months of another dramatic increase in value if the price follows its historical trend. I do not think the price is as tied to news events as many seem to assume, however the recent mtgox fiasco most certainly has had a big impact on the price, we have yet to see if that money is gone or going to come back quickly.
I think it is important to note that in the US most of the demand has been met for now, until regulatory concerns are further addressed there's a lot of people waiting for a signal to indicate how much risk they are taking. the earliest adopters are already in more or less. Overstock and Tigerdirect didn't affect the price significantly because they aren't holding any bitcoins right now, they did however indicate that bitcoin users are a very valuable market demographic to seek after which did not go unnoticed by competitors. I think there's still a ways to before the general public is using bitcoin for general purposes. but there are two thing to look out for with merchant adaption.
1. merchants will target bitcoin users trying to find what products the ones with disposable incomes will part with their bitcoins for. this is a giant pool of money enthusiasts will happily give away if given the right opportunity.
2. There a number of people looking to convert as many of their expenses into bitcoin transactions, bill pay, gasoline, groceries, transportation, these kind of services will attract a niche market if they can find those consumers an provide them with these kind of services. This will be more recurring long term valuable customers.
Other than that the biggest potential market right now that is likely to be the remittance market, bitcoin does for free what wester union charges some people 7-12% by allowing workers to sending money home to their   families while working in another country. This is billions and billions of dollars in value and as of yet there's not a quality service to make it available to those who would benefit from this service, but it is being developed.
There's many more services being produced that will continue to push adaption, bitcoin has a long way to go, regulatory concerns may slow it, but as long as the technology is welcomed anywhere it can develop pretty much everywhere. pushing the innovation out a country will only benefit the countries that embrace it.

Bad news is something else because for whatever reason people can start to panic. I know I don't suddenly have extra room in my budget to buy every time I read something that sounds like further validation of something I'm already invested in.

Since I believe the long term potential is a more robust and efficient system with much less overhead than what is used now, deflation aside I'd still expect to save money in the long run.

I wouldn't want to speculate how probable or appropriate this would be, but because the blockchain is a public ledger it could be possible to do an in depth audit of where the coins have gone and put the network up to a vote to administer justice by resting the stolen coins to those whom they were stolen from. 51% of the network would decide. Again I am not saying this is the way to go, but it would be an interesting experiment and possibly have some rather interesting prospects for the future of the network.

I'm not saying nothing should change, I'm just stating thats what it is right now. Your bitcoin wallet is not insured, and you cannot appeal to a third party to refund a transaction. I'm not blaming the user, I'm just saying thats what it is, so don't treat your money like someone else is going to protect if for you, with bitcoin it is your job to protect your own money and investments, the coding doesn't give a fuck how anyone feels about it.

I think you need to present better evidence that Andreas' association with N&amp;B as an 'advisor' was anything more than just that before you start making any kind of accusations or demanding he defend himself.

I'm not saying Uber should integrate bitcoin, lyft already kind of supports paying with bitcoin through gyft. I'm suggesting a decentralized rideshare service designed to function with bitcoin. Of course the design might be more complicated, but there could be a transparent or pseudo anonymous reputation service. the handling of disputes could be solved in a number of ways, I think possibly insurance could be the solution, of course that would require an additional service to exist before hand. 
So how about a decentralized insurance market that is bought per ride? when a customer orders a ride it could include an insurance policy and the collateral for the insurance could be crowd sourced. People hoarding their bitcoins could put up their money as collateral in the event of an accident and collect fees as long as the cost averaging was marketable it seems like it could work well. The policies  could be written and offered by the arbitrators and sold to the driver who would factor the cost into their own rate. 
What ever polices serve both the customer and the driver best would be whats marketable. Customers might preference drivers using certain policies, but drivers would be in control of the policy they choose to use. If the insurance polices we backed by crowd funding and investors could pool money to fund them so you could put in whatever amount you want and get a proportional return it should encourage prices to be as low as possible while still making a return for investors.
certainly thats not a perfect idea, but it seems possible and if it is I can't wait for it to exist.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:06:05
I believe we are likely still in some kind of speculative bubble but a rather long term one that will remain till the ecosystem evolves. At the point if bitcoin is adopted as a currency and regularly traded the price will find its way to what the market dictates and then the price will rise as the economy grows. It all depends on how it is used and how much. If bitcoin takes over the majority of the remittance market for instance, I can't imagine the price staying at these levels.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:56:08
So if I want to bet on the price increasing in say a 10 year span is that going to work here?

Remember,  bitcoin is still in development. If the right features are implemented and adopted the issues the platform faces now can be adverted. If bitcoin is successfully regulated and controled by goverments than the demand for a supierior technology should drive the development. Decentalization is going to be very hard to crush at this point but it certainly isn't a sure thing. The development of bitcoin the the moment doesn't seem as focused on increasing anonymity and decentralizarion as it should.

The biggest issue for any competing currency is that bitcoin has much much more development already on higher layers it is going to be difficult for any currency even with a fundamentally superior protocol to over take it, plus most features added in spin off currencies could easily be absorbed by bitcoin if popular enough.
There's say ethereum, which in many respects sound like it could be far superiorly more advanced than bitcoin in terms of making development and application of uses much easier and broader, but even that has the flaw a much more complex fee system and could not be as sound of a store of value in the future.
People have yet to accept that bitcoin's price per unit it totally arbitrary it doesn't matter if its $1, $10, $800 or $600,000, what ever the value per unit it has just as much practical application, the number of people as this point hold and using any amount of bitcoin is completely insignificant. if bitcoin's market cap even ever can compare to ebay its going to be valued much much higher than current levels but that still doesn't matter that its real value is the ability to send it instantly anywhere.
Its not the US that is going to benefit from bitcoin, it is the rest of the world, like when much of the developing leapfrogged past using personal computers to smartphone, the billions of people who don't have access to bank accounts will never need one and start using cryptocurrencies instead, this will connect them with the rest of the world's economy in ways that were impossible 5 years ago and protect them from massive inflation rates those people won't care if bitcoin can inflate in value or not as long as it protects their money's value enough that they can store it.

Free markets operate on greed, thats the nature of things. creating decentralized market solutions can mitigate that. With mutually agreed upon and beneficial rules hardcoded into markets people can remain greedy but operate under fair rules.
There's several possibilities for how decentralized exchanges could work, I'm no expert, but I think likely the best option is a network of decentralized bitcoin ATMs where buyers and sellers can make a transaction online and complete it at an exchange, the ATMs owner collects a small fee. The only real difficulty with decentralized exchanges is that cash is not really designed for such a system.

Ive heard of some concepts for this idea, not sure how well they could work, but for instance you could make a virtual placeholder for the value of any fiat currency tired to its exchange rate. so you could trade BTC for bitUSD, it would require some kind of autonomous escrow where if you aren't just trading but want cash back for your BTC you'd likely have to meet in person or have a way to verify a bank transfer or wire to place before they could receive your BTC. Of course bitcoins are completely capable of being used in a system like this, its the archaic fiat currencies that have technical issues, digital to digital exchanges are about as easy as anything else with cryptocurrencies.

It would require the owner of the ATM being involved in the transaction as they would need to be responsible for keep it stocked with cash. If it were localized where buyer and seller must use the same ATM it might be more manageable but less efficient.

Its unfortunate, but start ups dealing with rapidly scaling customer bases dealing with brand new technology can have trouble keeping with customer service requests, its nice that they on top of regular customer service have people covering social media sites, 2, 3, 4 hours is really not a long time, people go home for the day to spend time with their families and sleep. try calling comcast customer service sometime if you want to see negligence. banks can afford to have 24/7 customer service because they are huge institutions, but look at their shitty hours. try to be realistic.

Its pretty simple to realize that bitcoin if can expand its market cap the value will rise. I have not heard any argument I can think of why that would not happen. Why wouldn't the value increase with the market cap? I you don't think bitcoin is ever going to be larger than a $10-20 billion industry how do you expect it to change anything. I think $100-500 billion is not particularly unrealistic, and depending on how things develop it could be radically higher than.

They operate on the ability to collect fees, and having control to manage transaction off the blockchain is faster and takes the load off the blockchain as well. Maybe there is a way to work that while they can remain profitable. It is important as users we become very conscious consumers. An organized block of customers that will quickly move their money to the service providers implementing the best practices could help push competition to create the options we need.

What about protection from inflation? Maybe in some countries 2-6% inflation rates is worth it. What about counties with 20%, 40% inflation?

I want to see a blockchain service combined with a rideshare service like lyft, enable a rideshare application that removes the third party and is as open as bitcoin to users.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:25:34
Being able to process transactions with bitcoins on a service like lyft would be vastly differant then a decentralized peer to peer ride share application that uses a blockchain to process and varify transactions. Your argument is like saying "why would you use a bitcoin when a bank can process transactions and store your money for you?" Clearly there is a demend to eliminate trusted third parties for processing transactions and the reduction in fees that come with it. 
A distributed rideshare service would be of great value at this stage of development for the bitcoin economy because it would open th market up for a practical service and would let anyone with a vehicle start earning bitcoins. With proper implimention it could be the foundation of a highly automated distrbution system for transporting goods if adapted for trucking, air travel or shipping by sea.
Lyft simply accepting bitcoins as payment does not solve the issue that lyft is a third party between the customer and service provider and raising prices to sopve a problem that is now absolete, eliminating the need for that third party is exactly what the blockchain is capable,  we just need creative ways to impliment it. Maybe there is a technical reason this would not work, but if its possible this is exactly the kind of services that should be created to back up the bitcoin economy.

This is exactly how I've come to understand bitcoin. Its not the bitcoins that are inherently valuable, it is the blockchain, it bitcoin is a share in the blockchain, is there's value to the blockchain it will be reflected in its shares.
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:41:51
It would probably have to have its own blockchain, and coin. It would be mined like btc and would be the credit accepted by drivers, drivers could resell it for btc or whatever currency they prefer. On top of the blockchain the protocol would have to match drivers and customers together from gps info and a decent rating system. Unlike lyft, drivers could be able to set their own rates.
