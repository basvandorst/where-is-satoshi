Not necessarily, many entities could be interested on running LN nodes and opening channels for their users paying for it:
- Breadwallet could be interested on running a node, then each time a user installed bread, the company would open a channel between the user and Breadwallet’s node automatically with no cost for the user.
- Amazon could be interested on opening channels for it’s users, included with amazon prime offering payments to amazon with no fee at all.
- NGOs could be interested too in order to collect small fees to pay their activisms.
- Microsoft could be interested too, Coinbase, Bitpay to be used with Copay
- But still many individuals all over the world could be interested on running nodes to earn with a kind of POS
It seems to me something as the likes of ARK’s DPOS (delegated proof of stake). In the end, users would choose to open a channel with the node that offers the best conditions, and this channel could last forever.

Why should the btc return to the exchange? If you paid the scamer and then try to close the channel unfortunately the scamer gets the money as it would have been in an onchain payment to the scamer

LN channel included
Only this month 39,90€
Sounds not bad!
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:45:24
Mmh I’m not sure to understand you. If you have a channel with your exchange and you trade with someone that let’s say is 5 steps away from you, if the scammer closes the channel to his benefit the only part afected is the person or node connected to the scammer.

Bitfinex was hacked once and in the end it wasn’t so bad. I think if this tether thing explodes and Bitfinex disapears (unlikely in my opinion) there will be a big plunge as always and then a recover.
There also was fear that a collapse of bitconnect would bring chaos to the whole crypto space but as we have seen nothing really dramatic happened.

People in first world countries tend to think the whole world is first world. Your arguments are only valid there but remember that other countries have hyperinflation, have a really difficult access to banking or credit cards and so on. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that those few people around you are a valid and representative sample of the world’s population.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:56:54
I don’t really know what to think but the question is, why would they do that? Why destroy a working bussiness and open the door of a really complicated path?
Imagine for a moment that M. Karpeles took himself all the money out of mtgox, was it worth it? I mean, law suits, thousands of people looking at him, looking at mtgox addresses to see where the money goes... It’s not worth it, destroying a really profitable business as it is an exchange to then face such a destiny, I don’t see it, buy I might be wrong, who knows..
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:01:31
Yes that’s right. I think in the and people will need to choose wether they want a free channel tied to their identity or pay for it and stay fully anonymous. And I think most people, the kind of people that only uses Internet for facebook, whatsapp and web, will choose a free channel but the important thing here is that both options should be available and I think they will be.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:17:23
Regarding the on chain transaction fees to open a channel, I can imagine LN nodes offering opening channels with users for free (that’s nodes will pay for the onchain fee) with the goal of having all those users as “customers”, I mean all those users would use this node as the first step in the route of a lightning transaction. As these channels could last forever, nodes would earn really tiny fees for those users forever. This mecanism would incentivate nodes to offer channel openings for free, just to get as much users as possible in order to earn a tiny but perpetual income from users.
What do you think?
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:55:33
Nice, just one single thing to add:
- Top up a channel: if you use fiat to top up it will likely be done without onchain transaction considering your exchange will probably have a LN channel
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:15:33
I think is because segwit alone would not produce such a big drop in transaction fees and it probably would not last too much time. LN will not only bring really tiny fees but instant payments and a really higher limit in terms of tps and all this could open the door to a lot of new big players forcing old players to update or die.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:36:22
I think I understand your point but correct me if I am wrong. You mean an individual could open thousands of these free channels with the node making the node go out of money?
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:22:02
I think it will not take years, once one or a few exchanges or one or a few wallets implement it, all the rest should run if they want to stay competitive. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:29:24
You are totally right, I think many people could reach the bitcoin world opening directly a lightning channel ignoring completely what an onchain transaction is. There will probably be interest on node owners and exchanges like coinbase on opening users channels at no cost for users covering losses and even earning money by future transaction fees (at even 1sat/tx).
That makes the problem of paying onchain tx fees for opening/closing channels something to not really worry about.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:54:08
Syncing with the blockchain was ok but then got stuck on “Discovering nodes (seen 0 channels)”. Was able to receive funds via onchain tx. The app is on testnet not mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:12:00
It only runs on testnet so no risk at all

I am the developer of Beewallet for Uphold.
Uphold is great and having it in my phone with Beewallet makes it powerful.
I use to have both, bitcoin and euros in my cards. I usually spend euros but sometimes when bitcoin value is much higher than the price I paid, I spend bitcoin too.
Mostly I use it with my friends when we go out and somebody pays for somebody else. It's great to transfer money from phone to phone so easy.
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:37:34
If a wallet developer inserts a backdoor in his software and his goal is to scam people, be sure he will publish the code of his "open source" software WITHOUT including the backdoor. Don't take me wrong, I love open source code but when we talk about downloading software from an app store, being open source is totally useless from a security point of view. So if you are telling somebody to not use a wallet because of not being open source, you should also tell him to download an open source alternative, review the code and compile it, because just downloading it from the store will not work.
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:56:00
It still works as a bitcoin wallet if you did not switch to a fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:49:59
Well, while Gemini is an exchange, Beewallet is more intended to work with wallets. I don't know if integrating Gemini to offer just it's wallet features would be useful..

As the developer of Beewallet for iPhone I can say that Venezuela has recently entered the top 5 countries to download the app. It makes sense, let's see if that trend continues and other latinamerican countries join.

How is open source helping you if you then have to download a binary from an app store which could have been compilated using another source code? Unless you review and compile all the software you use, something I doubt, a little bit of trust is always needed. Is all your smartphone's hardware and software open source? I don't think so.

In Beewallet (an Uphold client) I implemented this way: you go to your fiat card, ie USD, you tap "Request Money" and then introduce the amount in USD, a QR code is shown with the corresponding amount in bitcoin but when someone pays you, you "receive" and store the amount in USD. Thats possible because of Uphold fiat cards.
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:37:32

Maybe you are looking for netki, a centralized service to resolve names into bitcoin addresses. Really easy to memorize names as emails.
There also is Onename, a decentralized id platform that lets you store your own bicoin address. We integrated Onename on Beewallet for iphone as a contact feature, feel free to try it out.

You do not need a piece of paper and it does not need to be empty, you just need your bitcoin address (empty or not) somewhere in your phone to copy/paste it when needed.

In the past I used Circle and Coinbase, both usefull for less experienced users but in the last few months I ve been using Uphold, also easy if you want to introduce youserlf to bitcoin. Once you get some knowledge you can decide to move funds to a sw or hw wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:36:39
There is no difference between carrying five qr codes printed in five pieces of paper and carrying those same public keys in your phone. There is no security concern on storing public keys in your phone. With 5 empty public keys in your phone you can transfer funds to your cold storage at home or security box the exact same way you will do reading a qr code from a piece of paper.

We would like to build the "email client" for bitcoin hosted wallets. An app to manage all them, in a really easy way, as email clients do with gmail, yahoo, outlook... with the ease of a simply horizontal scroll to switch between them, making easy transferring funds from a wallet to the others, and sending/receiving money to other bitcoin users.
We know not everybody here feels confortable with hosted wallets but actually they have their use cases and represent an important entry point for new users. This is an app for people feeling confortable with hosted wallets. Please feel free to give some feedback and feel free to suggest what hosted wallet you would like to see integrated in a new version.

I think you cannot analyze how the economy will be with bitcoin as a main currency considering that the entire economy system will stay as it is. In our economic system as it is now we need inflation and debt, that's the fuel today. Bitcoin cannot work with this economic system, the hole system and people will need to switch to something really different. To bring an example, many people will say that's not true but, nowadays money is one of the most important things in everybody's life, many people could change their hole life in order to have more money. Well, maybe one day people will switch their mind and realize that money is nothing else than a tool and what really has value, what people should be obsessed of is time, we all have a limited time and that's the only thing priceless. Answer me a question please. If I need a car and money is not a problem because as you said I can buy a focus today or a ferrari the next year, why should I wait a hole year? Why should I loose a year of my life wich is the most valuable thing I have? To drive faster? It's not worth it.
With such a simple change in mind a deflationary system will work without problems, I buy now because I need it now, because if I buy the next year one of my limited 80-85 years of life will be gone forever.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:08:34
I agree with the idea of forks being good for bitcoin. That's how evolution works: spontaneous variation + natural selection. Forks will bring a lot of try and fail thus improving the implementations that really work so opposing to a fork is really narrow minded.
@_date: 2016-12-11 12:07:48
The other day I was trying the "new Circle". I realized that as a bitcoin wallet it was full functional, only lacking of buy/sell functionality. Could Circle fit the needs of a hosted wallet?
Also I wanted to know, what does happen when switching to a Fiat currency within the app, is it possible to switch back to bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:40:41
You can use Uphold, I like it, you can buy with credit card. I developed Beewallet, a mobile client for Uphold and Coinbase, you can try that too ;)
@_date: 2016-12-25 12:47:52
Yes you can still have your bitcoins there. I think it should be as safe as it was previously.
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:30:10
Just send it to one of your Coinbase addresses. Circle still works as a bitcoin wallet so you should not have problems doing so.

This app merges in one single place Bitreserve with Spanish Bit2Me service. Cash withdrawal service offered by Bit2Me is only available in Spain inside the app. Send/receive/pay with QR code from or to Bitreserve cards are available worldwide.
To load other Bitreserve's cards just slide your finger above the balance.
Many things have to be fixed ie: showing balance always in euro. Please give me time to fix these issues and feel free to send feedback. A new version will be released soon.
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:56:05
I developed a mobile (iOS) app for Bitreserve named Beewallet. I also integrated Bit2Me service into the app so now in Spain, with Beewallet you can have your funds in euros and withdraw it on normal ATMs thanks to Bit2Me in app integration. You don't need a bank account anymore with this.
You can try Beewallet as a worldwide Bitreserve client: 
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:14:17
I am actually in talks with Bitwala to integrate SEPA. I will explore Cashila to consider it's integration too.
Any other suggestion will be welcome.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:22:55

Beewallet for iphone developer here. Many people do not like hosted wallets, but actually they are the biggest and easiest entry point for new people to bitcoin.
Beewallet is a an iphone client for two of those hosted wallets, Coinbase and Uphold. The goal is to make things as easy as possible and produce something that almost anybody can use.
The last development we want to introduce on Beewallet is something we called Sentinel and which one of it's goals is to make things much easier. Puting it into an example: imagine you are using Coinbase and you want to send money to a friend using it's email address as a recipient but you do not know wether he has an account at Coinbase or Uphold (more hosted wallets will be added in the future), then Sentinel takes care of your transaction to make sure to route money to the right service (Coinbase or Uphold). In the mean time transaction gets dispatched off chain making it instant and avoiding the payment of the network fee. I thing such things make life easier to newcomers.
This feature is ready in a beta release, if you or anybody wants to try it out just pm your email to send you back an invite to test the beta.
@_date: 2017-04-29 11:35:44
Never had problems with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-04-02 23:57:44
Well, Coinbase was paying your transacción fees until a few days, the fees that you were supposed to pay. Just because they stopped paying it does not make them "Fucking thieves". You should feel grateful for not paying miners fees all this time.
@_date: 2016-02-04 11:17:15
Thank you very much for your continous feedback, it's very much appreciated. 
Regarding the second issue, we fixed it. When you stay on the send or receive screen, now exhanged value is updated every time the exchange rate is, that is every 30 seconds. Is that enough for you or do you still need to see the exchange rate?
@_date: 2016-02-04 11:24:35
Please excuse me because I made a mistake, this update still does not fix this issue but other minor issues. Expect it in a few days.

Had problems with them, at the time the trade engine wasn't working properly, I submitted several tickets and after a month they answered with apologizes saying that the platform wasn't working well due to a huge amount of new users, I replied something like "Ok, but are you giving my lost 100€ back?" And they never ever replied to this. My conclusion, with kraken everything goes well until something goes wrong. In my case they had a really serious technical issue that made me loose 100€.

2. Regarding the ability to specify from which card the bitcoins have to come from when paying for something, consider that you always operate with the card you are using in that moment. I meen, if you go to USD card, then you send/receive from/to USD card. If you want to send from gold card just go to gold card and tap "Send Bitcoins", money will be sent from gold card. The same applies when receiving money, first you have to go to the card you want to receive to and then tap "Request Payment".
I hope you find this helpful.
Thanks again for your Feedback.

Spending should not be motivated by the quality of the currency and it’s properties, spending should be motivated by real needs. Once people realize that time is much more valuable than money they will stop postponing buys and will start leaving their lives as it should be.

There is “balance app”. I tried it a few months ago and didn’t get it to work, i even don’t know if it works on testnet or mainnet, there is few information about the app. By the way, you won’t find it typing “balance app” on the search box but “balance lightning”, don’t know why, or you can find it here 
Please if you get it to work properly comment here, in order we all become aware of this on iOS.

If you are creating it on a mac you can just download ubuntu or the distro of your choice and create a bootable usb stick with unetbootin. You can even leave free space inside to store permanent data.
If you are using windows I don't know.

Hi A new release of beewallet is available. You can now switch between favorite/non favorite cards with double tap on balance. Hope that helps you.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:10:51
Yes, another bullshit of a wikileaks wannabe user.

I can agree that being dead is maybe better for bitcoin and the community, but definitely it's not the best for Satoshi himself. That was my point and my sadness. I don't want to know who Satoshi is, but I will probably feel better knowing he is there, observing his creation, how his gift evolves and becomes something powerful for everybody all around the world. He just deserves it. Thank you Satoshi.

They don't but you can spend bitcoin on amazon.co.uk via Purse, wasn't that your question?
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:31:40
Hi There is a new update available for beewallet. As I said before, you can now switch between favorite/non favorite cards with double tap  on balance. I hope that helps you.

Uphold is a hosted wallet for fiat and crypto currencies, you just need to go to uphold.com and sign up to use it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:27:29
Yes quite good and easy to use
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:13:38
This is what it is, you like it or not and OP is not an idiot for posting it. If you don't like just go away.

I pay taxes for all my incomes, I pay taxes for having a car and I pay taxes for having a house. When my money goes to paypal, I have already paid taxes for it. If all your income is in form of BTC then BTC has a lot to do with taxes.
If you get paid in BTC as you said and you are not paying taxes then to me you are not different than a thieve. I am guessing you use roads, airports, you like to see some light in the street when you walk in the night. These are things that need taxes to work.
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:18:28
If that can help at Beewallet for iOS we added a feature allowing USD 0,06 fee transactions from Coinbase to Uphold and viceversa. Going to add more wallets to this feature in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:51:08
So you are always telling people you live on bitcoin since 2015, you get paid in bitcoin, you pay bills, groceries and every single thing in bitcoin and you are not tracked? Who is paying taxes for you then? Do you pay taxes with bitcoin? Anonymously?
There are always some inconsistencies on your stories.

This release (1.4) integrates Cashila and fixes some bugs. Now integrated services are: Bit2Me, Living Room of Satoshi and Cashila. Still working to add other powerful services in future releases.
note: I've noticed a crash in some devices when trying to use photo camera to pay with QR code. For now this can be solved allowing Beewallet access to camera in Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Camera, I will fix this in a future release.
Please don't hesitate to give any feedback.

Could you link to the product? I am looking for something cheap, a mini itx like machine, but this one feels pretty good.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:45:29
Absolutely, I like FreeBSD as the perfect compromise between security, stability and performance. 
Regarding OSX vs Windows I definitely feel more secure under OSX.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:09:19
Sorry this was an answer to a bitcoin_yoda comment, I will move it.
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:53:55
Yes, you can spend/receive funds from/to any Uphold fiat or bitcoin card. Just scroll horizontally to a specific card to operate (send/receive) with that card.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:41:57
Was there 2 years ago. I can remember all those "visa accepted here" all around Bali but in the end no one actually accepted visa or they accepted it charging a fee to customers. Would like to see "Bitcoin accepted here" instead, I guess there wouldn't be the fee problem.
Nice anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:08:12
Maybe you are legit but this does not mean  fair. You are letting other people pay for the things you use. If you think you are supporting everything via VAT, flight tickets... you are wrong. And for the school, well I guess when you go to a hospital you expect to find doctors and nurses. If your house or room goes into fire you expect a fireman to come to the rescue... if any of this happens in 20-30 years from now, those doctors, nurses, firemans are now going to school, the same school that you think you are not supposed to support because you do not have children. Can you figure out to live in a 100% illiterate society.
Some people around here are kind of bipolar, they say they are here for the good of everybody, to fight the injustices of the world, of the monetary system but then you figure out that they are just tax evaders, looking after themselves and they don't give a shit for anybody around them.
Summarizing, you are in the US, one of the most advanced countries, you take the good of being there but you refuse to support it, that's kind of parasitic. If you don't like whatever the government makes with your taxes (I can understand it) just work for changing things or go to another country but not paying the things you are supposed to pay because other people are paying for you is definitely not fair with them.
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:33:37
You are right nobody talks about Bitcoin Wallet but actually is one of the most downloaded Android wallets, who knows..
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:17:18
Oh so you are making direct contributions to hospitals, schools, roads, airports, seaports, etc.. ?
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:57:03
Yes, you seem to have some personal problem with Uphold, always looking for someone posting about them and quickly replying with your list of threads, but you do not realize that many of these threads have positive comments inside so I guess you have not even read the staff you post.
If that helps to other less grumpy people, I have an account with them since they were Bitreserve and never had a problem
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:01:09
There are better ways than bitcoin to keep anonymous on such an attack so I guess yes. Don't know if the attack is to control bitcoin's price or hurt it's reputation but my opinion here is that bitcoin is not a mean but a target in this attack.
It has been said several times in this sub, every time bitcoin goes up in such a way something "strange" happens. Too many times to be just coincidence.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:36:01
I can't understand why people keep thinking "it's me or you". Why should we stop ethereum? Why not all together? That's not a contest, just pick the coin you like the most and let others do whatever they want. This hole crypto thing is about freedom but your are asking to do the war with those that do not think like you. You know why? Because you are here only to make quick money, that's all.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:59:05
Cool! Thanks.
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:33:25
I am trying to help coinbase to fix what I think could be an issue but in the same time I would like to know if other users are experiencing the same because if it's not a coinbase issue then is a bank issue. I've been able to make purchases of bitcoin from a linked bank account but they never got the money from my bank account. That's all.
And yes, I contacted coinbase support directly, waiting for an answer.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:48:34
Well, as the developer of Beewallet (iOS client for Coinbase and Uphold) I saw a 4x or more increase in the number of downloads so this claim is definitely possible to me.
I am sure other wallets saw same sort of increases.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:07:12
I prefer Coinbase because their mobile app is better but xapo is a good wallet too. Maybe xapo support is more responsive. I think Blockchain is not a custodial wallet anymore and this is good if you want to take care of your own money instead of delegating.
If you choose Coinbase and you have an iPhone you can try Beewallet app (works with Coinbase) which I developed myself.
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:30:10
Hi bitcoinfinder, a new release of Beewallet with Cashila integration is now available for download. I hope you like it.

Those places have done for bitcoin much more than you could do in a hundred lifes posting day and night on reddit.
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:41:49
The issue is now fixed and as far as I know a small number of users where experiencing the same issue but it seems no one reported it. I asked for the white hat reward program but got no reply.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:28:11
I like FreeBSD, OpenBSD is also a good one.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:38:03
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:59:19
Thank you for the feedback.
1. 2FA is supported, it really doesn't depend on Beewallet, Uphold manages the process of 2FA, if you activate it you should get asked for the 2FA code.
2. You are totally right, I should implement a way to switch between a scroll with all the cards and a scroll with only favorite cards. Maybe with double tap to switch between both options. I will try to add it in the next release.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:19:44
Had a similar issue a month or so ago. I opened a couple of tickets with support but never got a reply. Then suddenly, after I was attempting to close it day after day, one morning I woke up and my position was magically closed. Since that I don't trust Kraken anymore, I lost 100€ in the process and still waiting for a reply.
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:43:20
Is it a customized machine? What is the hw and the case? Looks nice!
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:03:08
I don't think it's possible on Coinbase, go with gdax.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:53:08
I do not really know Espers, is it an alt coin?
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:54:59
Well, coinbase is one of the biggest hosted wallets and they are probably helping to grow the user base of the whole bitcoin ecosystem as an entry point for new users. I think a multi wallet client should definitely support it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:09:46
Yes, that's true if you want a good level of security, using a bootable usb linux distro, unplugging Internet and so on, the process is much more cumbersome with paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:19:59
Not really. OP said the private key would have been encrypted via PGP. Even if sender's or recipient's email login is compromised the private key is safe so the answer is yes, it is safe as long as the recipient's PGP key is not compromised. That's what PGP is for, provides security when using an untrusted or compromised channel.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:53:15
I am having really serious problems with Kraken and support is not responding. I would suggest gdax or bitstamp instead.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:02:55
5gb is not a little it's 4999 Mb more than actual size, they are asking 1Mb increase, yes, less than a floppy disk.
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:10:19
Mmh no, it is not
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:01:13
They talk about sending money like euros and receiving it like yen but isn't it just a bitcoin wallet like many others showing the balance in local currencies?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:53:43
Yes I would like to know too. It's not clear in the info around.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:13:41
Do you mean that if you choose USD the balance is actually kept in USD? How do they do that not being a custodial wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:47:19
What's the point of a hardware wallet for long storage? You still need to keep the seed in a paper or something, at this point the hw does not matter any more but just the paper with the seed. Isn't this after all the same as having a paper wallet? Just asking, not trolling. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:11:14
Destinia.com is still accepting bitcoin. You can change the currency in the top right corner in the homepage.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:23:03
Yes, it's a well known site here in Spain and one of the first bitcoin supporters but I guess it's not so known in other countries. Enjoy it ;)
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:52:22
Thank you for spending time on your reply. I appreciate your comment. I agree with you that many people here do not accept hosted wallets, but I hope others do. As I stated I think hosted wallets have an important role in the ecosystem so let's create synergies.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:36:50
But doing this would mean that minimum exchange fee should be at least greater than miners fee to be able to send the second transaction. Kind of strange.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:18:56
Maybe they lock accounts via coinapult but then the user would loose control over private keys, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:32:36
I wouldn't recomend it, the system doesn't seem stable under huge demand. I opened a position a few weeks ago with a closing condition of +0,5€ and the position instantly closed at -20€ aprox. There was a really strange behaviour with the FIFO, the position closed at my previous day closing condition. Later this day the system opened very strange positions on my behalf and staid kind of locked, I wasn't able to close those strange positions for the next 2 weeks. I submitted 2 tickets with all kind of details, and still waiting, I have plenty of screenshots. The strange positions just disapeared a couple of days ago.
Because of the positions closing at a wrong condition the first day I lost 100€.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:54:49
Have you tried to hold your balance in USD to see if balance remains stable?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:29:24
I think people prefer avoiding sign up processes and logins. Is your idea achievable without login? Would be much better.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:29:07
I submitted a ticket too 3 or 4 days ago and no answer. Their system acted on it's own cancelling orders and opening positions on my account, really strange.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:38:43
You are welcome!
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:44:38
Do you know what consensus is? You win a little and you give a little, the non sense here is staying as "is 100% like me or nothing". It's been very hard to get here, do not sabotage it. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:03:38
I have a similar situation with money locked in. Fortunately not a big amount but somebody in my situation with big money inside and a need to withdraw would be very frustrated.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:33:45
It's been a long time since I last visited destinia.com and now because of my comment I quickly checked the site. I think it deserves a few words. It should be an example of how a bitcoin integration should be. 
1. Easy to select mBTC as currency from the homepage
2. Prices listed in mBTC
3. Payment experience? Can anybody add some comments here?
It's really cool seeing prices listed in mBTC.
