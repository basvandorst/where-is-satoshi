:) I think one can diversify away from Bitcoin, e.g. PPC/peercoin seems to be a nice and stable PoS-hybrid. I think in there future there will be need for a coin that has smaller transaction sizes / a need blockchain organization. It's just another gamble, less diversifying in the traditional "investment" sense.

Thanks, I did not know that.

You are full of shit. Too stupid to read the technical papers?

Why are you measuring the price in fiat, when they're mostly traded against BTC? Litecoin has traded up as much as 0.1 LTC/BTC historically, so this is not anything new we are seeing. You could as well claim that the fiat price of Bitcoin is a bubble and the altcoins just correct and stayed on a reasonable level :D

This article might give you some insight into the alternative cyptocurrencies:

Screw them. Be happy you found out they're not real friends and move on. Europe and even the Netherlands has tons of nice humans, not only that kind of money hungry dirt. I had to cut ties with an ugly leech I used to consider a friend, and it feels great.

Otherwise, do you math: what's the average order size, how much is a keychain in % of that (or of the average profit of an order)? Do you have a flat 25% profit margin on your products, or will the promotion hurt you financially?
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:27:01
No, it is not completely analogous to a stock. The stock entitles you to ownership of something associated to the stock, possibly gives you voting rights and a share of the profits. You *can* own a stock for purposes of speculation (contrary to investing) and only do that only to buy cheap and sell higher. Owing bitcoin entitles you to nothing more than just the bitcoins you own, that's it. So I still maintain the point of view that just owning a currency to sell it later/profit from its higher buying power later is not *investing in* something.

Oh, I know that the type of work does not really matter (as long as it is a trapdoor/one way function under sufficient hardness assumptions). 
I'm talking about the long run, since we are talking about making bets on the future of payment systems and currencies. A PoW/PoS-hybrid with the same hashing power as bitcoin is more secure than just bitcoin's PoW. A system with an potentially infinite coin supply but adaptable rate to hand them out (e.g. netcoin) might also appeal to more people in the long run, time will tell. 
It is still a type of betting on the adoption of digital currencies/payment systems and therefore diversifies your portfolio less than e.g. buying real estate, but it's still diversification.
You just need to keep the ratios right...And sure, you can easily lose a bet to a 51% attack, it happened often enough...but there's always a risk involved.

First of all, that doesn't make Mastercoin a scam, even if it had a flawed target to work towards. Secondly, the Mastercoin protocol does not necessarily promise pegging to a real good?
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:39:57
They can impose other limits on their block sizes ;) But yeah, it won't help if they can't make up their mind. I think bitcoin will react in time.

Well, some altcoins add a proof of state, which for sure is a security benefit. I'm not sure if I really like the centralization of Bitcoin mining. So some coins like Yacoin


might indeed provide some long term benefits in addition. Netcoin has a voting system to adjust PoS minting rewards, which is also an interesting concept.
When talking about protocols on top of a blockchain, like Mastercoin, bloat might be an issue and an altcoin might be useful as a vehicle.
Maybe read the altcoin section of 


if you think that confirmation speed and scrypt vs sha is the only thing altcoins can bring to the table.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:09:03
There are some reasons to use other coins, ranging from PoS or PoS/PoW hybrid schemes instead of SHA256 PoW, faster confirmation and block times, voting rights on PoS proofs and stuff.
Bitcoin is big and its network effect is huge, but some coins are more than just boring clones and improve on the prototype framework that the bitcoin protocol provides.

I think it is hard to supplement the running network with new features without fighting for a consensus; personally I wouldn't mind if Bitcoin added a PoS to increase network security. 
If you ask specifically for Primecoin, then I'd say that it is a nice proof of concept, but the prime number chains do not provide a real benefit for the coin user (as PoS might) and moreover, the chains are of very little/limited use in academia either.
Of course, I see where this is going. Litecoin for sure is diversification, as is any of the other coins too. The question is, of course, whether it is a good choice to diversify. On the other hand, diversification mostly serves to mitigate and limit risk, not to maximize profit in general. So some users of other cryptocurrencies might even expect their investment to go bust.

Oh, sorry, I didn't pay attention to the user name :)

I think that with a market cap of more than 2 billion, a few people more or less selling or buying won't even matter.

I like this. Check out the planet instrument guys!

There is still no intrinsic return in that endeavor attached to you just holding BTC. Your profit will come from an increased buying power associated to the bitcoins you held. That's like speculation with foreign exchange rates (except that they actually carry an interest rate, c.f. carry trades). You are short USD and long BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:02:55
Some altcoins have new features and might be interesting, read at 


what the new features and drawbacks are.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:40:20
Who uses it? Isn't BTC the common symbol for it?
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:28:04
Depending on what definition of "investing" you use, buying and holding bitcoins is pure speculation - even if held long term. 


So you are not out for interest, share of profit by putting money into an endeavor, but only in for an increased demand vs offers. That might be one of the problems you have with @_date: 2013-11-28 07:02:04
We will all just switch to an altcoin of our choosing instead.

For a one time event, a free keychain is reasonable. But otherwise repeat customers will feel stupid about their 15 keychains, at least I'd do that.
