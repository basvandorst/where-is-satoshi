Because he still owns bitcoin.com and that’s where probably 90% of new users end up when doing research. He pumps his own scamcoin on there saying that btrash is “recommended” whatever that means. Doesn’t say by who or why. The whole time it pushes people towards buying a coin that is different than the one they set out to buy in the first place. That’s a scam and it’s not going to stop if we turn a blind eye. I agree, it gets him free publicity. However, by spreading the information that he is a known scammer, hopefully some newcomers will hear this and not fall for his tricks.

If you’re saying that with inflation eventually that number will fall under the entire worlds GDP, you’re probably right. That’s not going to be any time soon. But it doesn’t matter if the entire world switched to crypto and fucked off fiat. Sure it would increase in value, but 112.49 *billion* dollars? Not gonna happen. And this is coming from a long time and hard core Bitcoin supporter. If youre going to be in a market you need to be realistic about things. Don’t lie to yourself or others. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:58:57
112.5 B is what the “projected” 1000x increase would make it. If it sounds ridiculous to you, that’s because it is.

Find me one company that has bigger market share than the GWP and I’ll admit that I’m wrong. But no, you can’t have a market cap of $200 T with only $4T, that statement alone is ridiculous. It’s akin to saying “I have 4 apples in this basket, which means I have 200 apples in this basket. That’s dumb and also not how market share works. It’s how much it would cost to buy up all the shares.

@_date: 2018-09-14 00:00:03
Then you’re an idiot. 1000x is not realistic. It would mean the crypto market has more market share than the entire world market. The GDP of the entire planet right now wouldn’t match a 1000x increase in the crypto market. Maybe stop reading articles from people who stand to benefit from your deception? Take a step back and see what he has to gain by giving false confidence to the market.
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:04:01
If you want to blindly state that while you pray for a moon, sure. If that gives you the encouragement you need to hold on, great. But it’s not fiscally or morally responsible. Anyone who says this 1000x price increase is possible let alone likely is spreading misinformation regardless of intent. The reason this guy said that is because it instills false confidence in the market. That’s very, very good for him. For both his business and his holdings. Now I’m not bashing bitcoin here. I think there are some serious long term gains to be had. But that’s from my own digging that I’ve done. If you look at the math, you’ll find that 1000x isn’t possible. If you want 1000x go buy some alt that’s worth pennies. Hope it moons. But with Bitcoin, we’re well past that stage. You missed the boat on that one, should have invested ten years ago.

So what happens if there isn’t enough money in the room to buy all the apples? Those apples can’t be valued higher than the total capital available.

Sure, not all of it would be liquid. About 2/3 of the worlds GDP (GWP) is basically made up numbers. Only 1/3 of that is physical assets. So if we’re talking in terms of *liquid* assets, let’s cut the GWP by 2/3 for reference. Now lets make the similar assumption that 1/3 of Bitcoin is actively traded, which I would say is more than reasonable. Now the GWP is roughly $78 trillion in nominal terms. So let’s divide that by 3 and we get the actual dollars/assets in existence. We get $26 T. 1/3 of this guys projected 1000x increase is $37.5 T. That’s still 1/3 bigger than the entire collection of assets across the whole planet. How can anyone look at that and say it’s realistic? That would mean that the world would need to be trading 1.5x the value in Bitcoin than all the assets in the entire world, including Bitcoin. That’s impossible according to physics. If someone would like to show how it’s possible to spend more money than is in existence, please show me how. Seems like a useful skill to have.

When you see an article on here, it’s to manipulate the market. If it’s bad news, they’re probably short selling. If it’s good news, they probably just bought in. Don’t take these articles at face value, do your own research.
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:54:25
Well then he’s a fucking idiot. If that were to happen then crypto would be worth more than the entire worlds GDP. I hope I don’t have to explain why that’s not possible.
@_date: 2018-09-14 00:07:21
That’s not how market cap works. Market cap is basically how much money it would take to buy up a whole of something. So for a company with 1000 stocks @ $10 a stock would have a market cap of $10000. Now take the number of Bitcoin in circulation and multiply that by the cost per coin. That’s your market cap. At the time of writing this the market cap is about $112.49 B. Now that x1000 would be $112,490,000,000,000. To state that that is likely let alone possible is a ludicrous misdirection. This guy just lost all credibility in my eyes.
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:55:44
1000x gains would mean that business (crypto) is worth more than the entire worlds GDP, which is not possible.

This is more of a proof of concept than anything. The hashes you could get with even a million light bulbs is around what you’d get with one dedicated machine.
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:57:35
You need to realize that a 1000x jump in crypto price would mean there isn’t enough money on earth to buy it all. Obviously that’s impossible. Stop listening to people with a stake in the coin, they’re just trying to sell you more to make their stake more valuable.

I think most of those issues are solved by having three keys, any two of which open your wallet. You hold two and give one to a lawyer or other trustworthy person. You can give one to your family, that way if you die they can talk to your lawyer, present the death certificate, and open your wallet. It helps if you lose a key as well. Still doesn’t fix the problem *completely* but as with all forms of money it’s on you to do your due diligence.

Y’all are dumb if you believe the banks actually said that. This is obviously propaganda trying to get people to buy coins so the price goes up.

Probably not until the next generation starts using currency. Having grown up around it, Bitcoin will be easier for them to use/understand than most people alive now. That’s when the real adoption happens baby.

It shows how worthwhile it is to mine a certain coin, so it’s actually a great metric for how a coin is doing. Basically it means there’s so few people using the coin that it’s not profitable to validate transactions on the blockchain. When a coin has inherent value, people are going to use it and that attracts miners. Low hashrate is a symptom of low value.

You still have control though. The lawyer can’t do anything with your portfolio unless you give him another key. It’s not completely trustless, but it’s the best thing we’ve got atm. Doesn’t even have to be a lawyer, could just be a spouse or a friend. You could also make a dead mans switch that will send the remaining key/keys to your family after it’s triggered.

Honestly though there are shills all over this sub. I wish I had the context to see who’s right. The fact that the response is the bitcoin equivalent of pointing out someone’s grammar mistakes makes me think the user was avoiding the point. Many politicians do that. They avoid the question by talking about something else. Just a friendly reminder to always think for yourself and do your own research. Don’t trust anyone here. Most people are trying to influence you. Some users have bots that spam good news or fud to manipulate other users. Some play on your fomo to get you to buy in before a crash. I’m running on at this point so I’ll wrap it up. Like I said, just remember to have a healthy skepticism about this subreddiy (and any other source of information.)
