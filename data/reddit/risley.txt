Serious question, you only pay taxes on what you pull out right?   The actual profit.  
You put money in, buy 0.1 BTC, value goes up and so it’s worth more.   You don’t pay taxes on the profit until you convert it back to dollars by selling it on the exchange.  
Is this correct?  Or do you need to self report what you invested in and that nothing has been withdrawn?

@_date: 2017-12-01 12:24:00
Here’s my question, how much would someone have to invest for someone to make serious money if bitcoin explodes in value?   Seems like you need a lot of full bitcoins, not fractions which I’m sure more people own.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:03
hahaaaaa BOI YISSS
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:47:17
Another bit of 10-30.  No reason to rush.  You never know what will happen and this investment can have crazy swings.  In all honesty it’s about how much I’m comfortable losing.  Sure I could lose money if it climbs dramatically, but at the time I’m only comfortable losing my 10-30 dollars.  I prefer to be conservative a bit.  I mean, we already lost the chance to buy whole BTC when it was cheap, so now it’s just slow and steady.  Much like putting money in an IRA.  And think about all the people who don’t know shit about BTC.  You are still getting in when the vast amount of the pop is clueless. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:16:12
Yeah but the cost of taking them off can be a bit steep as well.  I made a tiny buy (like 30 bucks) the other day and I see that if I transfer them to a wallet (like electrum) then you have to pay a fee.  There is a point where the cost of transfer is significant since the number of bitcoin is so small.  At what point do people feel comfortable about leaving in an exchange or coinbase before they know they should withdraw?

If coinbase won’t send my BTC bc “not valid BTC address” error, can I send it to GDAX and then send it to wallet from GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:19:58
Why is this bad?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:39:51
Same.  I remember reading about bitcoins and wanted to start mining just to do it.  I didn’t bc I was lazy.  Nothing more.  Then I thought I’d buy some years ago bc just to have some.  I didn’t bc I was lazy.  Nothing more.  Then early this year, I thought I’d buy in bc it’s time.  I installed electrum and stored my seed in the filing cabinet.  Then I didn’t do anything else, just bought more video games and did nothing else.  Bc I’m lazy.  Now I look back and just get mad.  But fuck it.  It’s done. I bought like 25 bucks of bitcoin the other day bc enough is enough.  It’s true, if you have the money and can safely invest, trust your gut and do not be lazy like me.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:09

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:39:31
Well that makes sense.  Transferring one coin for another (BTC to Dollars, or BTC to ETC, or BTC to LTC), its the same thing.  You are transferring "gains" of one currency for another.  But if you just buy BTC, and transfer it to a wallet, you didnt actually gain anything.  The BTC can increase in value, but you arent cashing it out. Just storing it.  So I'd think you dont have to report that.

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:29
Holy shit thank you.  I tried asking this question a week ago bc in my mind I couldn’t make up how you knew which coin was traded for the other.  I viewed as one big pot that was pooled and from that you traded for an alt coin.  
In my case, I bought ETH over several times and then one day traded it for XRP.  I kept going back to what particular amount of ETH was traded for XRP, bc the amount of profit differed depending on how far back the purchase was.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:20:57
This is what kills me.  I wanted to play around with this at 1K, but then i was just lazy and didnt do anything.  I finally bought some tiny amount and hope its not terribly late at this point (i think it is).

So like-kind transactions make sense but simply buying BTC doesn’t create a tax situation unless you *sell* to claim your profit.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:12:13
Exactly.  At this stage it’s gambling.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:37:03
Is this because every bitcoin transaction is recorded as part of the block chain? So if you have the seed, it can basically pull out what value you have?

Here's what I still dont get, there appears to be many other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin.  Why are there so many?  Surely a handful is most reasonable.  Is it just the tech behind how they are kept from being hacked?  Or how they are mined?  What gives any one of them more of an edge over the other?
If there is some massive review that can go over this, and actually inform on why youd buy into litecoin versus bitcoin (aside from the lower cost), I'd love to read it.

The Shadow knows!
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:42:27
Precisely.  You can’t look at this with such rose tinted glasses.  Just look at all the *other coins* out there RIGHT NOW.  most are worth dollars to fractions of a dollar.  Anyone got an idea which one is next to grow?   By next year one could presumably climb to 10,000 bucks, and we’d all be here again.  Just make the best educated guess that can be done safely with your financial level.  And if you score big, that’s great.  If not, it’s just life.  There will always be another investment opportunity.  You just have to do the work, do the research, and wisely play what you can when you can.  If that doesn’t suit you, just be like the rest of us and get a normal job and save.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:52:17
Makes me question, why don’t people just buy like 10 coins each of these super cheap coins?  No harm if you lose it and then it’s nice if it takes off. The CoinCap app lists like 1000 coins.

No they didn’t.  They thought it was made up.  They still think it’s made up.  They are helpless and selfish to boot.

How is it insecurely? Are you saying if someone just hacks exodus then they can take the coins whereas if you use a ledger or paper wallet, no one can access them?
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:20:33
This is the part thats confusing to me.  If I have my 12 word password, how do I not have my keys?  Arent the coins stored on my computer?
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:17:19
Lmao on that salt for not getting a card before the boom
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:25:36
So then where do you store it? I have no idea about bitcoins but I'd like to buy one. How do I do this?
