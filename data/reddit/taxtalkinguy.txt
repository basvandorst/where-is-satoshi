This is NOT correct.  The FBAR must be filed to report foreign accounts, whether the foreign account holds currency or property.  For example, you must file an FBAR to report a foreign brokerage account that holds securities.

Actually, it doesn't really matter whether MtGox is a financial institution.  A financial account includes, but is not limited to, a securities, brokerage, savings, demand, checking, deposit, time deposit, or other account maintained with a financial institution **(or other person performing the services of a financial institution)**.

You have it almost exactly correct.  It's not just fiat in a foreign financial institution that must be reported.  It's ownership of a foreign financial account, whether that account holds fiat or stock or bitcoins or stuffed hummingbirds or gold or whatever.

This is not the case at all.
The FBAR must be filed by U.S. persons with over $10k in one or more "foreign financial accounts."  A foreign financial account includes a bank account and a brokerage account, but the language defining the term is broad enough to potentially include things like an account at MtGox (or other non-U.S. bitcoin exchange) used to hold Bitcoin.  
Whether an account at MtGox is included in the term "foreign financial account" is currently unclear, and this article does not change that score.  The article only says that Bitcoin itself is not reportable--it doesn't say anything about whether an account at MtGox is reportable.

You may want to discuss with an attorney first.  The IRS could pounce on you for penalties depending on your facts.

You are correct that I am correct.  :)

That's not quite right, either.
You must file an FBAR if you have a foreign financial account and the value of the account is over US$10,000 in any year.  The issue here is whether a MtGox account is a foreign financial account, not whether bitcoin is currency or property.
You are not required to report Brazilian real estate whether held directly or in an entity.  You would be required to report it if held through a foreign financial account (I'm not sure how that would work exactly--maybe a foreign brokerage account that holds stock of an entity that holds Brazilian real estate).
Note that there is a completely separate tax reporting requirement called IRS Form 8938, which requires you to report specified foreign financial assets if they are over a certain amount (which amount depends on your situation).  For purposes of that form, you are exactly correct that you do not need to report real property held directly but do need to report real property held through an entity.

The issue here is whether a MtGox account is considered a foreign financial account, not whether bitcoin is considered currency or property.  (The last question is irrelevant for FBAR purposes--taxpayers must report foreign financial accounts, and those include both accounts that hold currency and accounts that hold property.)  
So, stated another way, if you take the OP's view of the situation, then you should file an FBAR to report your MtGox account even if you only held bitcoin in the account (as long as the value of the bitcoin was over $10,000 at any point in the year).

Great post, I won't weigh in on whether one is required to or should file an FBAR if they had a MtGox account--OP is much more versed than me on the ins and outs of that issue.
I'll just add that I am also a tax attorney, and I have a website that allows people to file an FBAR with attorney review for only $49--it's

No problem--you must file an FBAR to report a foreign financial account, whether that foreign financial account holds currency or property.  Stated another way, it doesn't matter whether bitcoin is currency or property (for IRS purposes or under FinCEN regulations)--what matters is whether a MtGox account is a foreign financial account.  Our esteemed OP takes the position that it is, and I've taken no position since I have not fully researched the issue.
