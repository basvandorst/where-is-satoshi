Sorry, but would you care to cite where you got this from? Any facts or analysis or numbers you run to reach this conclusion?
Last time I checked you need majority (51%), the higher the majority the safer it becomes. You can always use the majority hashpower to produce empty blocks on the minority chain.

Nobody can force users to follow anything. In fact, as part of bitcoin's design someone could create a fork at any time. Then they could do what you just said and have a PoW change to keep it alive. Everyone that has bitcoin now, would have bitcoin on the fork and can do whatever they want with both of their coins.
If you don't want to change your mind that is fine, but please use  correct arguments.

I would love to hear the answer to this question. @_date: 2017-02-25 17:34:33
I understand the ETH split and also the risks involved with a HF so I will proceed to illustrate you, even though won't understand reason as you are probably paid to support your position. People might still read this post and see why the risk of splitting are lower than people like you make it seem and how the comparison with the ETH split is not fair.
ETH retargets difficulty with every block, so it was economically viable for miners to keep mining in ETC. In bitcoin, difficulty retargeting times are much longer , making the low hashrate chain be the shortest chain and with longer confirmation times.
The minority chain could always change the code to set a new difficulty and some protection mechanisms to keep the minority chain going. However, that could be done at any time. The risk of a chain split with some modifications to keep the smaller chain alive aren't higher or lower with a HF. All that is needed is some motivator (i.e. controversial change, HF or SegWit)

You are using a lot of conjecture in your reply. Also ad hominem attacks and finally inciting FUD without base.
Although long, your reply does not actually provide a proper response to the arguments given, which are simple yet true.
1. Bitcoin could split at any time, it was even suggested here on r/bitcoin a couple weeks ago with changing PoW to fire miners. This if done, would lead to a split as miners wouldn't just simply just keep mining with their version of bitcoin.
2. ETH and BTC protocols ARE different, specially in difficulty retargeting, but since you cannot argue against this you went on this huge tangent.

Imagine a distant future were we are very close to having computer power able to crack private keys. 
At that point, we will have to update Bitcoin. Users will gradually move all of their coins to the new, updated, more secure addresses until only the coins to which no one has the private keys remain on the "old" addresses. At that point a the bitcoin crackers emerge. Entities that focus their computer power on retrieving old bitcoins that no-one else could claim ownership of.

If you want to hard-fork and keep bitcoin with current PoW you HAVE to have majority hashpower.
If you want to create a new coin that has the bitcoin ledger as a starting point then hashpower is irrelevant, however this is likely that the new coin would have a low value (i.e: see all the alts that are out there).

A HF is not risky with &gt;95% support as SegWit requires. If the real fear is bitcoin splitting and there being two chains, that could happen anytime.

@_date: 2017-03-19 01:20:19
Bitcoin is decentralized so there should be no Core, neither a monopoly on who decides what gets added or not to the protocol. One example of this is SegWit, where both a malleability fix and a block increase were bundled together. Doing this introduced politics into bitcoin, saying if you want one, you have to agree to the other.
The alternative is doing them one by one, i.e. let's see if the network wants to raise blocksize, and once that is settled decide if the network wants a malleability fix.
This was proposed in the past by other implementations, but once they gained traction, there was a meeting with Miners and Core developers (Politics again) that blocked the effort. The situation we are right now is Bitcoin being what it is supposed to be and breaking away from politics.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:41:06
This statement is a phallacy. You can't say Bitcoin value is decentralization and a SINGLE group of developers.
You could say:
Bitcoin's real value is in its decentralization, it's immutability and the fact that you can choose which developers code to run. (which is true in the current situation)
Hashpower itself might not be part of the value, but actually the cost of attacking the network is. With a CPU algorithm, an attacker could easily rent computer power to overtake the network. Part of bitcoin's value is that a CPU attack would be insanely expensive,  attacking it would require a huge investment in specialized hardware (ASICS) at which point you will be better of using it to mine and make money.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:33:07
All of th advantages you say are true for a malleability fix. However, it should be your decision if you want to use a channel or a regular Bitcoin transaction to move your coins. With current status (full blocks+high fees) you are FORCED to choose between paying a high price (sometimes even more than you want to move) or using a channel (if we had a malleability fix)
With larger blocks, you would have the option to choose.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:42:08
The fact that you are saying commandeer means there is a leader. Which in Bitcoin there shouldn't be as it's decentralized.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:58:35
The reason a democratic node voting mechanism was not included in bitcoin is because this metric can be very easily sybill attacked. This was contemplated in the conception of bitcoin and that is why decision power was given to hashpower.
Hashpower is an investment in the network and in order for that to be profitable it should make decisions that favor an increase of price for bitcoin. Hence, hashpower is controlled by the ACTUAL market (**money** not nodes). 
So instead of UASF a split would work better and the actual market will decide. If people don't want to risk picking a side, they will have coins on both chains.
Other coin that has smart contracting went through a a split situation and the main chain has been 5-10x more valuable than the minority chain. Just recently this increased, where the main chain had a 2x price rise that was not seen with the minority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:56:51
People choose to run the software, but defining people and majority is the problem. Would you use nodes? exchanges? voting with bitcoins?
Bitcoin was designed to decide with hashpower. Hashpower cannot be faked and miners will follow the economy if they are truly profit driven.
All other methods can be faked. You can pay for people to speak on reddit and forums. You can create fake users to vote. You can vote with bitcoins then move to a new address and vote again (or in the opposite case, if the software tracks moved bitcoin, lose your vote because someone voted earlier) and you can fire up thousands of nodes overnight.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:30:30


That is not true. All digital goods, i.e. downloading software has an infinite supply yet you pay for them.


See above answer.


2nd layer provides a lot of advantages, i.e. can have faster confirmation times, can be used for other "services" other than bitcoin i.e. notarizing, keeping track of ownership, yet provide the validity of the robust bitcoin infrastructure. This merits on their own, should be a market for 2nd layer transactions, keeping a blocksize limits only forces things that could be done on-chain, off-chain.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:15:06
Ending up with BU won't do any bad to you or the network. The only "disadvantage" is that the fix to transaction malleability would be late (which is not a priority right now).
I guess your position comes from the fear that has been instigated in this forum but think about for a second:
-Miners have invested MILLIONS of dollars in their equipment, and it is very likely they wont get their money back if bitcoin price drops. They have done their research and chosen a side.
-In the worst case scenario, a fork, YOU can choose to sit the fight out. You would end up with your coins in both chains and then see which is the one that thrives. Just make sure you have control over your private keys.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:48:49
Replying again because somehow my reply doesn't show up when I logout... Surprise...
The drop in price is not necessarily about BU or Core, is about the event of a hardfork. This has happened in the past in other coins, however price is way higher now on the majority chain.

You are completely right on that. Problem is, how do we set the price? Specially if networks, equipment, etc has changed.

Not on the free market called BitTorrent, so yeah, thanks for making my point.
If your point was true, all software companies would be out of business. You can use BitTorrent or Pay, both have advantages disadvantages and you are able to choose. Same should be true for on chain vs layer2.


All that is good, right?
All that is done by SegWit.
My oposition is to SegWit as a soft-fork. There is no argument on either side against SegWit as a hard-fork with a 2MB block increase, yet Core fails to provide this. This should at least make you question why? Then if you look at core developers, some have a conflict of interest with a company that provides layer2 software.

The biggest precedent is the whitepaper. Everyone that has bought bitcoin from the start knew the rules (Assuming they read the whitepaper). Just recently, some people decided to try and change these rules since they didn't suit their agenda. However, Bitcoin was designed around hashpower, so the only way to go against the majority of hashpower is to change PoW.
People are free to change between cryptocurrencies, so it is in the miners best interest to not do anything to drive a lot of users out of bitcoin, that means not imposing onto their users. In this case, something HAS to be done, be it SegWit or increasing blocksize and its getting defined right now by miners.
There is a lot of buzz right now and a hard-fork sounds painful but with the majority of hashpower the hard-fork would be smoother than you think, because as I said earlier bitcoin is designed around hashpower. 
I will give some examples:
Once the majority hard-forks, that chain will become the longest (more hashpower = faster blocks).
The less hashpower miners are left with the dilemma of hard-forking again to readjust difficulty or to wait forever for their blocks to confirm.
If they readjust difficulty, miners from the larger chain could just switch back and kill the short chain with their majority hashpower.
That leaves changing PoW as the only option. If that happens, then miners that were supporting the minority chain, might as well just mine the majority chain so they can get something out of their hardware.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:58:17
I was referring to market, which would set its price based on costs in addition to supply and demand.
There is no need to set a BIP for a free market, all you have to do is raise the blocksize limit while at the same time releasing fully working 2nd layer solutions, then people will decide which one to use and which option is worth their price.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:55:02
Introducing SegWit as a soft-fork required SegWit transactions to be labeled as anyone-can-spend transactions to unupgraded nodes/miners. This is an attack vector that requires widespread consensus to diminish risk.

In the real world, people can exchange between different cryptocurrencies as they would between two chains. Just now, go to Poloniex, Gemini, Coinbase, etc and you can do it.
It is in the miners best interest to keep the price of bitcoin high to increase their returns.  When they choose to hardfork they do it with that in mind. Rationale for forking could be simple, blocks are full all we have to do is increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:29:06
I think you are focusing a lot on the reddit discussion which I don't really trust. As an example, if you go to r/BitcoinMarkets, people are generally indifferent about BU/Core. I think the "reddit support" is a lot of noise on both sides.  
There is no need for polarizing debate, BU does not have any intention of becoming the default client. Core can always modify their codebase to be compatible with a larger blockchain, just like BU is compatible with the current blockchain. Truth is, there should be no default client.
If people are going to go on a ego run and sell all their coins if a larger block is produced and accepted, I'm sure there is also people that will be eager to buy in if bitcoin's capacity is increased and confirmation times are reduced, and specially if bitcoin survives the hard fork. If people are indifferent and don't want to risk it they can always just sit it out, they will have coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:52:47
Exactly, you had to focus on the CD. Keeping the blocksize is like not allowing people to sell flash drives. Gives no options to use it. The price of the CD is not only defined by CD supply and demand but also by pricing of direct/indirect competitors.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:05:29
I am a BU supporter and I love this!
We have operated under maxblocksize for so long, (even at a point where we didn't have it) that raising the blocksize would probably be safe. I think there will also be patched versions of Core that would allow running on the new network safely.
As far as UASF, this is just full circle to be what bitcoin was designed to work around. People realize this and is nothing but a sybil attack. It would end up in miners forking off the main network for some time, loosing revenue until they revert back.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:23:30
Sell the rumor buy the news.
There is a possibility of a hard-fork happening, that possibility is now priced in. Since a hard-fork brings uncertainity, price will go down the closer we get to a hard fork. By the time the hardfork happens there possibly could be no drop and then one coin will absorb the value of the other.
That is why the faster we hard-fork the better it would be in the long run for bitcoin.

Is someone going to talk about the elephant in the room?
Part of bitcoin genius is that even if all miners colluded they could keep you from spending your coins but could not take them.
SegWit was introduced as a soft-fork by using a hack that ultimately, would allow all miners to actually gain access to users coins.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:25:04
You won't get it activated. There is currently about 16% network hashrate signaling for a different implementation that does not at all support SegWit, however it does solve current issues with stuck transactions and high fees.
Even if miners pushes through with 51%, that won't be enough, since SegWit used a "hack" that makes SegWit transactions visible to unupgraded nodes, it would be possible for miners to get SegWit activated, then signal it back and take those coins. That is why its threshold was set to 95%
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:33:13
You can think what you want, Im just reporting what the current state of signaling is.
You are just adjusting the numbers to fit your narrative.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:17:02


Where do you get that from? To get an incrase in blocksize (which would solve the fee and stuck transactions problems) all that is needed is to merge the code and begin signaling see how long it takes. Heck, there are even implementations that have already done this.
This will then give a good more than 18 months to develop a hardfork version of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:15:02
If what we want is a increasing blocksize, we should do that!
With a 95% activation threshold a hard-fork poses no risk.
The misinformation is because at the moment SegWit was introduced, Core developers such as claimed bitcoin didn't need a blocksize increase, but fixing transaction malleability was a more urgent matter.

@_date: 2017-01-08 18:10:56
Yes, that is pretty much what I meant, they can mine on the minority chain until the big block is produced. After a big block is produced and backed with more than 51% of hashpower producing bigger blocks the "lazy miners" will have to switch client to be on the majority chain. Now remember that bitcoin difficulty adjustment is every two weeks and since you have less hashpower on the minority chain this will be the shortest chain and with long time to produce blocks
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:02:22
From your perspective you get silence. People actually answer them and then the posts that support it get deleted. This sub is an  echo chamber. Proof of that echo chamber behavior is current SegWit signaling. Miners have actually looked into both sides of the SegWit discussion and picked a side, however the reason why they picked not signaling to SegWit would get deleted from this sub.

The longest chain is going to be bitcoin. You can justify and say all you want but people aren't going to put $14B worth of money in something that takes 40 minutes to settle.
Such a change of PoW has been suggested before, I agree that people that support SegWit should do it. Current miners stay on the no-segwit-as-a-soft-fork chain. I will for sure like to have my money secured by the amount of hashpower bitcoin has. Not sure what you think.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:34:10
Its not about contentious or not. The problem with ethereum was its fast difficulty adjustment. That allowed it for people to keep the leftover chain alive.
In bitcoin since the difficulty adjustment takes weeks, a correctly timed fork (right after the difficulty adjustment) would cause the leftover chain to take forever to produce new blocks (due to less hashing power with equal difficulty) and would leave that chain obsolete.
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:28:38
Bitcoin can still get the benefits of SegWit, they have been proposed as a hard fork and I think the code is already out there (mentioned by Luke-Jr). 
A lot of people support (its even in Core's roadmap, vaguely though) SegWit now, block increase later... So the other way around or simultaneously should not be a problem. This solution would not be as complex as the introduction of SegWit as a soft fork.
The only reason not to do it would be that a hard fork would require a blocksize increase with it, and some people seem to vigorously oppose raising this limit. It is very hard to justify hard forking without increasing the blocksize. 
If they are both introduced (SW hard fork and block size increase), there should be no opposition since that is where the division is. People that support SegWit agree with the "blocksize increase" it delivers and the people that are not supporting SegWit is because it's implementation as a soft-fork, they do support the features it delivers.

I would be a really small fraction of what you call "the market" which is what ultimately governs bitcoin.

That is a very valid point. However, a moderate size increase could still be run by most, probably you too. With a moderate increase you would get both benefits, a decent fee and your own security. As far as fees, the average has doubled in the last 7 months ( It will only take a couple of doublings (which could occur more frequently everytime) to make it unfeasible.

Most of ETH protocol upgrades are done through hard forks. SegWit would be much better (and probably backed up by most miners) if it was introduced as a hard fork. Core's resistance to Hard Forks makes updating the protocol hard.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I don't see why people are excited about SegWit as a soft fork. I believe a hard fork would have been better yet here we are.

Whoever disagrees with the views of this sub is delusional to the people here. First fuck Coinbase, now fuck Circle, you guys are going fuck yourselves out of the majority chain. If SegWits current adoption rate is not a wake up call, then I guess nothing will wake you up.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:13:14
Exactly! But if bitcoin is only used for high value transactions (which people with limited resources could not afford), low resource people won't care about the "good of the network". Same goes for safety of LN nodes. It's like donating to a millionaire...
@_date: 2016-11-23 00:10:57
Approximately 10% of the network is currently mining with BU. Is that enough testing?
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:36:11
Sure, but let's do it the other way around. First HF to 2x and then activate SegWit
@_date: 2016-11-06 21:23:26
There is no reason to oppose the 1MB to 2MB block size increase, however the push to keep the block size as 1MB has been so hard (to the point of introducing SegWit as a soft-fork) it lead me to suspect ulterior motives. Then I found that Blockstream's told its investors that bitcoin COULD NOT scale, and their business model relies on providing an option for increase of capacity. Evidence:
In addition to this, the discussion in this forum is not fair as the censorship is organized in such a way that it aligns with Blockstreams business model (coincidentally or not) having no open discussion about any other scaling alternatives, yet allowing posts that sayhard-forks are bad. As an example, despite other implementations of bitcoin being banned from this sub, classifying them as alts on moderation policy, this sub allowed posts about ETC, referring to it as a failed hard fork. Also, when the safe hard fork strategy was introduced, which would allow a better introduction of Segregated Witness taking care of the risks associated with a hard fork, it was also not shown in this sub.

According to Luke-Jr, core developer there is no rush. So we could certainly do your option A. Source:

Just look at the current vote for it. Miners are people that have invested millions and also made millions from mining. I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem for them to hire a technical consultant before making the decision in case they need to be informed about the decision.
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:23:06
Very decent post and great language. My concern is that it is a major change to the code (including new addresses), I am not the only one, had it been such a good update it would have activated by now (i.e: CSV). 
SW as a soft fork plays tricks in the network and its introduction as a hard fork was a hack. If the network cared so much about fixing malleability a hard-fork would have been introduced and activated by now.
@_date: 2016-12-03 19:15:10
Honey, segwit is more of a change than BU. It has been posted here somewhere too, that BU is 99% of core's code.
@_date: 2016-12-03 19:26:10
People that have low resources on the network don't update because they can't, it will be struggle to go higher either because it is not possible (bad internet providers) or can't afford it. 
Do you think these people with low resources are going to keep their nodes up just so LN hubs can benefit? or so that some high value transactions can be settled on the blockchain? (If they could afford either of the two, they probably could update their node)
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:06:27
I wouldn't go as to say it is a virus. Keeping code that has been tested thoroughly is an advantage, modifications can make it better or worse. 
For me "updating" Bitcoin with SegWit is like the update from Windows XP to Vista... Major changes, the intentions were good, but the huge amount of changes had bad effects.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:34:56
The fact that SegWit Transactions were not included in Bitcoin Core, shows that Bitcoin Core does not care about the regular user.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:40:20
The problem is you panic bought, In contrast I bought BCH 11 days ago at $600 and I am at a 66% gain, more than if I had stayed with Bitcoin.
I also hold BTC to hedge, but what happened a few days ago were for sure some good warning shots.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:35:16
Such a great argument, redditor for 2 weeks! Sound logic too!
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:52:18
Your argument does not make sense because of 2 reasons:
1. SegWit was set to activate way before the NYA, so it was ready even before the plan was set in motion to activate it.
1. Core was not preparing for replay protection, they wanted S2X to add it and not modify Core. There was no intention of Core adding replay protection

Until everyone in the Buy/Hold room decides its their price to quit, then everyone is going to rush for the doors but truth is, not everyone is getting out.
However, if your gym has actually usable machines, there are more people that are going to stay there working out. There is no reason why you can't have both.

Here are some examples:
To add to that, there is always a remaining value, which is the *true* value that was created, in my example, the workout machines. The problem is that Bitcoin stopped creating those machines a while ago. As a store of value, only derivatives have been created (i.e. trading products) around Bitcoin but its usability has not.

People trade things in and out of fiat all the time (i.e. Houses, stocks, goods, etc). Given that fiat is inflationary, then things like homes are deflationary and people still sell them.
I believe by the time Bitcoin is the main means of exchange, the deflation will be minimal that people won't care.

Joke and dissenting opinions aside, that is actually very good advise. I did upvote your comment
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:12:35
The reason dragonslayer won't work has been discussed in rBTC enough to show that if a lot of miners switch to mining Bitcoin Cash, the difficulty will adjust to make it less profitable than Bitcoin.
The DAA adjustment was the best thing to happen to both coins, BCH gets 10 minutes blocks and no miners abusing its inflation and BTC does not get the crazy backlogs it used to.
If there is going to be a flip on hashpower is going to be fueled by the markets, which is how it should be.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:01:11
I don't think you even have to do a UASF for covertasicboost. Miners at disadvantage, i.e. BitFury will signal for it and it would allow seeing if that is the true reason for other miners opposing SegWit.

Indeed. As a founding member of BU, a couple data points (not to toot my own horn here, simply because it demonstrates the timeline):
I joined reddit exactly because I smelled some bullshit on the MBSL. This is my very first reddit submission. Nov, 19th 2013.
Title: "The blocksize limit - time for another look?"
You can confirm by clicking on my user page and then submissions.
I sensed no need to become involved in 'the Bitcoin community' (other than to own coins) before that.
After all the anti-XT and anti-bigger-blocks propaganda on rBitcoin back then, I wrote a draft BIP together with Aug 17th, 2015
That draft BIP contains the essence of what is now BU's blocksize model. And in there, I even quote people who had that idea earlier on the Bitcoin-Dev-ML!
All well before any mention of ASICBOOST anywhere. All well before the current mining landscape. All well before BU's inception even.
And BU's inception is long before any major miner signalled BU.
The claim that BU came out of nowhere as a "set-up by the Chinese miners to block Bitcoin's progress" is just ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:19:14
There is so much wrong with this, it is not fair to the users:
Avoid a chain split: A hard-fork with majority support won't split the chain. Minority chain would get attacked into oblivion.
Upgraded non-upgraded wallets can transact seamlessly: SPVs won't have a problem with a blocksize increase. Also, all  services would have to do is upgrade their node (They could even do it to Core with a blocksize patch)
Requires upgrade to ful node to maintain security and backward compatible with old nodes: They are both checked for SegWit which means SegWit will be insecure since it would allow old nodes to run.
80-90%- support? Miners? How did you come to this number?
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:51:44
He is wrong though. If the chain forks, minority chain will have SegWit, which disables ASICBOOST. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:16:00




You'd have to be an idiot not include a fix for malleability and quadratic sighash in the second hard fork.


If this was the case, this is also a problem with SegWit as it is proposed right now. I think sidechains will take care of transactions at these point so it won't be needed.
Yeah but I guess soft-fork are definitely easier, just look at SegWit for example. /s
@_date: 2017-04-02 00:46:19
Aaaand BU is at 51%!
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:02:59
You can't just say a hard-fork in ethereum is the same as a hard fork in bitcoin. Ethereum adjust difficulty every block whereas bitcoin does every 2016 blocks. This leads to the minority chain not only to have slower time to produce new blocks, but also will take longer to adjust the difficulty. This will in result lead to people taking forever to transact in minority chain, if you can't move your bitcoins, is as if you didnt have them.
Nonsense. Segwit is secure since it can't happen before overwhelming support. Old nodes will still work and can upgrade on their own time frame to **regain** full security.
You say regain full security, that means it is lost at some point.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:17:59
I think miners should be making political decisions because they are the most invested in Bitcoin.
Economic nodes although they make a sense have a couple pitfalls: 1. How do you become an economic node and what would the criteria be? If its high then big companies will be in control, leaving smaller companies. If its low, it becomes simple to sybil attack. It has the additional caveat that it is not anonymous.
If you make it just a matter of money traded (i.e. for exchanges) they could just fake volume) or if its a matter of size and money invested, what is to keep an entity (i.e. Government) to invest $200M to get "voting" rights.
Although ASICBOOST is unfair to other miners, does it really compromise the safety of the network? The real answer comes organically if the fix is proposed to the miners to vote:
Case A: All miners signal for it and it gets integrated as fast as other soft-fork proposals (i.e. P2SH). This although doesn't prove they didn't use it, shows that they will not use it in the future.
Case B: All but the miners that are suspected of using ASICBOOST signal it. They are "outed" hence despite they can use it, people now know this is happening. This would then lead to people to actually "decide with their money" and move price up, down, sideways accordingly. If price moves down, miner will be in a situiation where it is in best interest to stop using it. See case A.
This might seem like a lot of time, but that is the way changes to something as robust for bitcoin will take. I know it seems like something urgent, but if they are actually using it, they have been using it since at before June 2016 when someone brought it up on reddit and the network is still running fine.
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:55:45
LOL. They have been biased towards Core and that is known. The fact that a proposition of boycott once someone disagrees is immediately brought up show the lack of maturity of this sub
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:53:13
The thing is, no modification would be needed. Those companies could quickly run a patched version of Bitcoin Core that allows large blocksize and continue in the main chain.

If they bought ethereum with what they sold, they would be at a profit with their ETH and ETC combined.
