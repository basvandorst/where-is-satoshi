I think this may play out similar to bcash as long as they implement replay protection. But I think it will die faster as once the price starts crashing anyone who would be buying b2x coins has probably already bought bcash. Could be more free coins to dump let's just hope it doesn't hurt the overall price of btc

OB support the B2X hostile takeover attempt of bitcoin so I strongly recommend not using them
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:29:39
Bitcoin had some miners holding up segwit. Also they have done such a good job the network and price has grown huge. OB doesn't have this problem as no one uses it. Haha just some friendly banter keep up the good work it's actually a great idea hopefully you guys can pull it off, Amir did a good job for guys well done forking DM

This is copy paste from  sums it up fairly well:








@_date: 2017-08-26 06:22:13
OB support the B2X attempted takeover of Bitcoin and should be avoided. They forked from a good idea but the developers are incompetent so it will likely fail.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:11:39
As segwit was held up by some miners lightning hasn't been able to be tested on mainnet yet. Once segwit activates you will probably see more info on this in the coming weeks
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:47:00


Thats funny cause the OB devs seem to give core a lot of shit for not rushing things like hard forks ;)
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:34:26
I did say not to reference the HK agreement for those reasons and also it was also not measurable...
I think a lot of those users you mention (me being one of them) dont want the blocksize increase because they dont think it will be needed if we implement segwit. But at some point if the network keeps growing maybe it will?
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:41:17
If the network needs it once segwit is implemented then I also think it should be increased.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:36:59
Go fuck your mum if u want fuck ;)
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:50:58
The problem is some people don’t seem to trust some of the core devs (I don’t get why but anyway). That’s why I thought it might be a good idea if some of the core devs made a clear, easily understood, measurable plan to fix the network if its still broken after segwit. The plan should include measurable things like in the example I used in the original post (dates, transaction times, fees).   may explain why this isn't possible and I’m fine with that as my knowledge is limited but thought it was worth a discussion

Anyone who doesn't like the way xapo supports 2X should use and recommend  this is how users show we have power. 2X clearly does not have user or developer consensus, it doesn't even have industry consensus  Although a lot of miners are signalling NYA they will mine the most profitable chain. Lets see how many users buy 2X coins backed by 1 old tier 3 developer and a few CEO's. Be ready to dump 2X coins before it crashes to nothing.

@_date: 2017-09-10 06:29:17
A lot of the OB devs support the NYA 2x attempted removal of core and Bitcoin takeover. I recommend NOT supporting them or any other company that supports the NYA. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:10:33
 are the business and contact details I recommend contacting to let them know 2X does not have user support

@_date: 2017-10-26 13:04:58
That's a bet I'm willing to take. I dumped bch asap and made a very nice profit before it crashed, will be doing the same with 2X.
My point was though that people don't need hash power to dump 2X that will crash the price like what happened with bch.
How long are miners going to mine 2X if it's less than btc? Hint: check how fast they abandon bch.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:44:08
Agreed. The point is any miner can assign hash to core and not be breaking the NYA agreement
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:09:42
A better way to fight against 2X is be ready to split and dump your S2X coins asap. Money to be made if your fast enough before it crashes like bcash
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:20:10
90% of the hash power is signalling that they are ready to support 2X. This does **not** mean the will or have to exclusively mine the 2X chain. If they mine the core chain they can still point some hash at the 2X and not be breaking the NYA. Not that NYA was a contract or binding agreement anyway
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:43:40
I have a trezor and they said they will provide a guide to splitting.
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:57:55
I'm a hodler so I hadn't looked into it but their statement sounded fair especially for DCG company  I guess my point was anyone against 2X should boycott those companies and look for and recommend alternatives
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:03:01
Agreed. And when they do they are actually not breaking the agreement. Be prepared to dump your 2X coins asap before it crashes like bcash continues to
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:02:45
Signalling means very little e.g miners are signalling NYA and segwit on bcash
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:34:37
I won't be doing futures as I don't like having money on an exchange for that long and at the current price it's not worth the risk. I'll wait till fork, il be surprised if 2X is valued more than current futures but it's less risky. I also think btc will spike up before the split
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:41:15
Split and sell b2x asap before it crashes.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:47:35
They don't have to do anything as the agreement was not a contract. If the they want to stick to the agreement they must point **some** hash at b2x but definitely not all hash
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:51:11
There are ways but not easy without replay protection. Depends how u store your coins I use a trezor so hopefully they have a tool or tutorial to split when it get closer
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:19:09
Why would miners point all their hash at the 2X chain? Signalling just means they ready to support NYA, is does NOT mean the will point 100% of their hash at 2X. There was nothing public in the NYA saying all hash must be pointed at the 2X chain and if there it has been broken with bcash

He said on Twitter "It will be removed next time we restart our pool server". 
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:44:27
Maybe I have this wrong but if I wanna dump my 2X coins why do I need to transact on the 1X chain? Price is supply and demand on an exchange. 2X will have lots of supply and no demand imo hence the price will crash?
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:15:01
Yep, you are correct re-reading. They only need to activate.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:11:02
If its under $10000 and you purchase something for personal use you dont pay CGT but over you do. If purchase was over a year ago you also get 50% discount. Hopefully someone else has some cool way of getting out of paying tax like an offshore company haha but I dont know of any way

Well played sir, this not over you head at all haha ;)

@_date: 2017-05-14 20:34:51
Replace debate with disagreement then... Maybe relax a bit mate :) both sides are so hostile and hell bent on their side winning we are getting nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:45:54
Props for trying to help resolve this scaling debate but maybe not both at the same time. Maybe if a dev put in a bip to increase the blocksize after segwit is active after x time and if fees are over x amount and transactions are longer that x then increase the blocksize. It could help some of the big block camp to jump on the segwit side cause if it doesn't fix the issue they will get the big blocks they want.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:22:25
Confidence in this fork is at an all time high  /s
@_date: 2017-05-01 07:07:05
Haha ease up mate, maybe if both sides where not so quick to snap at everyone we wouldn't be in this mess. I definitely worded it wrong and didnt explain what I trying to well at all as I'm neither an academic or developer so my understanding and vocabulary is limited. I'll try again:


@_date: 2017-05-29 11:29:11
I dont know enough technically to comment but I really hope both sides get on board and we finally have a scaling solution. The extremists on both sides will probably both hate this but I doubt it will be worse than the standoff we have now. Let make bitcoin great again woo haha :)
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:46:51
Sounds like good way forward and safest way to get segwit BUT I think the 2mb increase should only happen if needed. For example in 12 months after segwit network activation if the average transaction fee is above x and confirmation time is longer than y we then increase to 2mb.
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:28:51
A **few** users **may** have asked but no data was collected showing who asked for what so this is meaningless. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:15:24
Except none of those companies asked thier users. The 5.1 billion USD and 20.5 million wallets does not belong to companies it belongs to the users who did not sign any agreement
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:30:37
Yeah hopefully this works, its definitely not perfect and I would have liked the 2mb hf only implemented if needed and with more dev/test time. But it's definitely better than where we are now. 
I like the idea of a UASF just not confident in BIP148 without major exchanges/wallets on board. So I'm throwing my support being this as I think it has the best chance. Thanks to all the Devs helping with this
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:05:43
I'll follow what I think the best scaling solution is and whats best for Bitcoin. Doesn't have to be core but what I saw on the segwit2x GitHub made me realise it probably would be.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:56:43
Good stuff if I'm ever back that way Il drop in for sure
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:30:14
Agreed, just some Devs are saying 6 months is a bit rushed for a hf as there is no code or testing yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:09:39
We both know a 20mb hf is not gonna happen in 12 months but if your actually serious we can make a friendly 1btc bet? Like I already said I like the idea of UASF and I think it's having a simular affect it did in litcoin and we are gonna get the best tested peer reviewed scaling solution Segwit, but it might come as segwit2x.
