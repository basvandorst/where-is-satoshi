Apparently this guy has never read "Cracking The Code" By Peter Hendrickson, the first American to successfully file his taxes with the IRS without paying a single penny in federal tax, medicare or Social Security. Since then over 11 million dollars in tax revenue has been *LEGALLY* claimed back by Americans who have educated themselves by reading "Cracking the Code", the book that uncovers the largest scam and biggest shame to every American living.
NOT A SINGLE PENNY GAINED FROM BITCOIN IS TAXABLE UNDER UNITED STATES LAW OR CONSTITUTION. Nor is the money you are paid for working your private sector (non federal) job!!! Thats the MAJORITY of you people!!! Only federal employee's are legally obligated to pay their taxes, so people read up and educate yourself on the scam called the IRS that is stealing every American's money and putting it into the pocketbooks of politicians who are trying hard as possible to completely ruin this country war by war.
You can download the book there and liberate yourself and NEVER PAY A PENNY OF TAX AGAIN.
You can also see the bulletin board where people have posted their tax returns and gotten 100% of their money back from the IRS, in accordance to US LAW!
Do your American duty and support your constitution, not corrupt systems and politicians! 
I will never pay a CENT to my government again. They will NOT use my money to start wars and murder innocent people over resources politics and money.
The ENTIRE purpose of bitcoin is the transfer of wealth from large and corrupt organizations (cough government) into THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE. This book is ALL ABOUT what bitcoiners try to strive for!!! PREACH!
