This page only talks about social media accounts, not their website. If their website was hacked and they said so in their webpage, you are lucky. Get a lawyer.

Congratulations for that beautiful work.
I would say Bitcoin is designed to provide financial independence creating a worldwide electronic money with no central banks, free from inflation.
Independent = Decentralized
Deflation = 21 m cap.
If you say "Bitcoin is designed to let you store, send, and receive money without any banks or credit card companies."  you will have to explain why most people is still using Coinbase et all to " store, send, and receive money ".

Bitcoin is **open** source and nobody forces you to use it. Period.

Are there any rules to vote/select/change those three? How is that process held?

So if I use a LN wallet on, lets say, a mobile phone where all those channel transactions are kept, and then I lose the phone... I guess I'll need to keep my own backup of those transactions to recover them, is that right? Same thing if I use desktop and then change to a mobile or online wallet?

How are balances securely kept if not in the blockchain?

I'm not asking that, I'm very happy with Core devs.

So who decides who is the owner? An exchange? LBC customer service? So, tell me again, what is the blockchain for?

Hey that should be a question. Bitcoin is not here to provide cashflow for miners. Mining is a very dinamic business, and Bitcoin will always provide them the largest income.

What is this torch thing? Should I pay to that address to vote for who is geting the torch next? What if I want to vote someone else?

Thank you, I'll check Ray Dalio's ebook first.

I mean a book or web site by a well known and respected economist who addresses the obvious concerns brought by free printing loads of money without an stronger economy  backing that new money put into circulation.

Thanks. Can you recommend a mainstream source where all this process is explained in detail? Really want to know what they say about how this game ends up.

With what does the ECB pay those bonds? Freshly printed money? I guess they first need to have some assets to back the new money , or can they print at will?

This post leading r/bitcoin today is proof that we have reached the bottom. Time to buy.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:09:04
Thank you, this is exactly what I was looking for.

Get over it. You guys lost that debate more than one year ago, and you already have your shitcoin (now scamcoin). Enjoy it and leave us alone.
@_date: 2019-04-04 04:41:44


No. Never worked.
Just tell them not to buy bc it's not for everyone.

Learn about 2FA. Do some some small transactions to learn and get confidence, then send your bitcoins to a hardware wallet like Trezor if you own more than $1,000 in bitcoin.

I'm indirectly involved. Some guy is accusing a friend of unethical behavior because an unidentified guy used his network to do a trade. I'm helping him find out who it was.

WTF is this? Ohh they have a 'whitepaper' and their own tradeable ERC20 (Ethereum) token and try to extend their business to become a "financial third party", just what Bitcoin is trying to avoid. Uninstalling.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:26:32
Also BitPay could use a backwards compatible request for wallets not supporting BIP70. See here: 
Don't know why they are not doing it.
