Ok so if it goes up 50% in 8 days, I am guaranteed purchase rate from today correct?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:07:08
True true. But what is this wall I see everyone mentioning?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:26:51
What if I’m just going to buy and hold about $1,000 worth? Can I just purchase through Coinbase and leave it there?

Purchased $200 of Bitcoin yesterday for the first time. Thinking about purchasing $500 more now. But I pay via my bank account and it says it’ll take up to 8 days to show in my Coinbase account. Is there anything I need to worry about with the long lag time?

Yeah I’m just looking to hold onto them for awhile. 
How long does it take to transfer the funds as USD?

I just bought a small amount of Bitcoin today from Coinbase for the first time. I keep reading to make sure to transfer to your wallet..what does this mean? Do I need to do something else after purchase? Anything else I need to do to make sure my investment is secure??

What if I’m just going to buy and hold about $1,000 worth? Can I just purchase through Coinbase and leave it there? Does Coinbase purchase automatically go to a wallet?

Thanks all!

So what would you recommend I do?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:00:41
Bought under $200 worth today. But thinking about buying $800 more. Should I transfer to a wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:00:53
Knew I should have bought more when it was 16K couple days ago. Should I go ahead and buy now or do you guys see a dip coming again??
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:32
Yeah I misread and thought they said Coinbase instead of Bitcoin. 
I understand that’s the risk with any type of stocks, etc. I’m thinking maybe I’ll wait til it drops back to 16K since everyone seems to think a small correction is coming. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:39:01
Why is that??

What does everyone think about LTC? Bought $100 worth earlier today. Thinking of buying some more. 
I’m new to the whole crypto scene. Do you foresee this being anything like BTC?
