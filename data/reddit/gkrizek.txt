I bought 2 at $990, think about how I feel!

I haven't seen their commercials lately probably because I don't watch a whole lot of TV. But I can definitely agree with what you are saying. Their CEO said on TV that they are really trying to tap into the Bitcoin part of the market and see what it can really do. They are really driving hard for that part of the market and definitely use it for marketing as well. I feel like their CEO is also one of those people that really wants to see bitcoin expand and be used more so he really wants to show off that they are a huge company that is accepting it.

Awesome! We share a Cakeday then! Congrats!

I have learned so much too. They are a great organization in my eyes. I have donated to them 2 years in a row and they are always incredibly grateful for donations.
Yeah it can be hard to find at times. They also accept the most Altcoins I have ever seen someone accept.

Who is Bitcoin?  The Foundation? or just a random twitter account you saw?

I bought 2 at about 990$ and yes I still hold them. I'm still confident that the price will be much higher than that eventually. I'm not sure how long. Could be years could be months. No one really knows so why not just hang onto them

Thank you!!

Is this the same as installing Ubuntu on a flash drive and creating the wallet on there and never connecting to the internet?
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:16:55
Haha I like your thinking. I don't even care to learn how to trace coins.
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:35:35
Great to see a BIG company backing it. I'm not a huge Google fan. Would be concerned with security for me and my information.

I figured it was just a waiting game for something like this to happen to Gox. I would never use them because I have only heard bad things from my friends and now this. I have never gotten the sense that they actually care about their customers. I have always had a feeling they haven't been honest throughout. Gox should not be held to the standard that they are. They were once the place to go, but now, I would recommend them to anyone. No matter what.

I get what your saying and I agree that I don't like exchanges having that info either but it's more about the fact that PayPal handles more than just buying something. And for me, they haven't done a good job with keeping up with their responsibilities lately. I used to love using them but it's gone downhill. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:48:56
Shit, I'll take some
@_date: 2014-01-17 05:55:59
How are they going to move all these coins with no Private Key?
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:23:39
I agree completely. I almost want to consult the Tor Project on what they think about this. I would think that most phones would not get a very fast speeds and would seriously hurt the network. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:20:36
I completely agree with you. I have always preached that it is a long term deal that can have huge benefits, not a get rich quick scheme. I'm just saying that because it's so new it is very volatile. so in order to get the most bang for your buck buy them at low prices. This won't be a factor in the future but for now it helps consumers who buy on Overstock and things like that. People need to stop thinking of it as quick money to make. Bitcoin is a Network first and a Currency second.

Thank you!!!

Most of these seem like just misunderstandings. A few legit but most is just no understanding things
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:00:36
I'm not saying it should replace PayPal. PayPal has it's place. The fact that it's anonymous and can't be reversed should make users feel a lot better. You can do what you want without being tracked by Big Brother and you can't get screwed out of a lot of money from some scumbag. They can't be double spent. That is an advantage to it, you aren't able to spend them in more than one place. Do you understand the protocol of this technology? Paper money is still the most used currency for fraud and criminal activities. The companies aren't riding a fad. They are taping into a new and emerging market and don't even hold the bitcoins. They are simply responding to customer wants.
With more adaptation and tools, this will be just as easy for the average joe as PayPal. There isn't anything too crazy about it but it can be a little scary for some people. With things like the Target incident, people have a thousand reasons to stop using credit cards. I don't see a whole lot of advantages to credit cards over bitcoin. Especially comparing the positives and negatives of both things.
If there is something superior to replace bitcoin I can't wait for that! I couldn't imagine something better or more secure.  I don't really see anything being more practical. In our day and age, what is more practical than being able to send a secure form of money from your phone instantly without using a separate service to handle your money.

Hopefully this is the last straw for Gox. Maybe people will finally see how terrible they are after this.

I agree that Erowid's "look" needs some work and hasn't changed much. Nonetheless, their research and knowledge is incredibly useful. They are a vital source of information, especially for the coming future.

I wish something like that would come to my school. I would be that asshole that asks him questions he can't answer or ones that destroy his point.

isn't this in violation of the copyright for Yelp's logo? It's producing their branding without their consent?

As of this morning this has been blocked by the judge.
He will not be making an appearance in this trial.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:03:58
Didn't answer my question. If they are as obvious as you say you could give at least 2 examples on the spot.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:11:03
I think this is fairly good thing for Bitcoin in the public eye but theres definitely some things that bother me about it too. Specifically in this episode, Matt says "BODYSLAM by China". Thats too over the top, China sure didn't help bitcoin but it wasn't what I would call a body slam. It was a setback that is being resolved and will be fixed. It obviously affected the market but I feel like our ups and downs in price are because of stuff like that. People overplaying whats really going on and freaking people out. It just throws things off even farther. When he talks about the price fluctuating he references one exchange for the high and a second exchange for the low. I see that as incorrect reporting because each exchange has different price. It makes bitcoins seem even more volatile than they already are. (which we all know is very volatile!)
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:38:17
You have missed the point entirely. The amount of money is irrelevant. I was making a point that if you aren't responsible and safe with your money it will get taken. Whether your money is in USD, BTC, EU,Chickens or Cats.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:50:44
Thanks for the input!  I don't want to sound sketchy with this because I will definitely follow through and its not some kind of scam. I put an approximate number on it now for somewhat of a goal. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:48:44
Yeah I can agree with that.
It does seem like a lot but like you said. I'm leaving it up to the internet to decide what goes on my body. Scary thought. It definitely can be reached with enough really small contributions. Not sure yet! Depends on the design selected and where it would fit best and so on... 
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:22:36
I can definitely agree with this!  Never trust anything from MSM. Just frustrating to see sometimes. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:29:53
Just voicing my opinion, If I didn't think I was right I wouldn't believe it. Sure there are smarter people, but facts are facts. If you get those wrong then it doesn't matter how smart you are. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:31:56
When you reference the man losing 2.8 BTC, this can be done so easily with money as well. If I leave $100 on a table at Starbucks and get up to order something else there's a chance someone will take my money. It all comes down to being responsible with your money and keeping it secured. Any kind of money, no matter the currency can be lost so easily if you don't guard it and if you aren't responsible with it. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:20:17
Look dude I'm all for criticism on everything. Specifically, in that article there are legitamet criticisms. I can definitely see the points and the backing behind it. But there are definitely some incorrect statements in that article and I have seen that a lot lately. I respect criticism but hate incorrect facts
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:52:14
Alright, in your opinion what is the biggest "fact" spread on this subreddit that isn't true?
