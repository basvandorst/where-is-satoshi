It's possible with a hard fork.

Discussed elsewhere in this thread: some ad-hoc method, requiring consensus. Then the hard fork lives or dies, depending on how the community feels about it.

You haven't lost anything, assuming you still have access to your breadwallet private keys.

Please clarify exactly what "taking possession" means.

So everyone who owned 1 BTC on Nov 24, 2017 will be taxed on $61 of income, for the Bitcoin Diamond fork? The Winklevosses, with their alleged 120,000 BTC, are not happy about this.
I heard different advice in an interview with a tax attorney and a CPA - they recommend assuming a value of 0 at time of fork. Check out it:

You don't even need to create your own bogus fork, others have done it for you:
I just looked at Bitcoin Diamond on coinmarketcap.com. Hard fork on Nov 24, with an initial price of $61. Suppose you're a Winklevoss, with 120,000 BTC. You just received $7.3 million of taxable income! Expect to pay, let's say, 30% on that, or $2.2 million. Ok, but today, BCD is worth $9.99, and you have $1.2 million worth. Not even enough to pay your 2017 taxes with - assuming you can figure out how to sell BCD.

I've just read the IRS guidance ( I've read section Q-7 several times, and I'm unable to convince myself that it agrees with your point of view. Though you're right that they never mention "trading coins" or "switching protocols",  their phrase "exchanging of virtual currency" seems to mean the same thing. Prove me wrong, please!

How does the question of like-kind come in here? In a hard fork, there's no exchange; it's more of a grant. Like the calf example.

I think this question deserves more attention. It affects people who did no trading whatsoever. I think the IRS considers the coins received at the time of fork to be taxable income. Determining the value of those coins may be difficult. But someone who acquired, say, Bitcoin-cash might owe tax on that event, and given today's prices, be unable to sell enough of that Bitcoin-cash to cover their 2017 taxes. And yes, they could declare a loss for 2018, but that's limited to $3000 per year.

I think there's a flaw in this line of reasoning. If you realized gains on cryptocurrency in 2017, perhaps you owe additional taxes on that gain and your other income. When I'm in that situation, I file just before the deadline.

The crash was good. My non-technical family members have stopped asking me for hot tips on cryptocurrency "investing". At least for the moment.

I can't tell if *you're* being serious or not (I'm just kidding).
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:18:54
Treat it just as you would a stock sale, where you bought high and sold low. You bought 0.1 BTC for $2000, and sold it for $1000; your loss is ($2000 - $1000) = $1000, so you have a $1000 short-term capital loss.
Sounds like coinbase's 1099 isn't very helpful.

2018 to have even more hard forks than 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:04:31
The amount claimed as income, and initially taxed, is the cost basis. You pay capital gains (or claim a capital loss) on the difference between your sale price and the cost basis.
