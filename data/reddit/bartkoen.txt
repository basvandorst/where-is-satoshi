At least two possibilities:
1. As mentioned in the article, he might have bought it through gray markets, but falsely claims partnership with SGI for whatever reason (impressing investors? tax fraud?)
2. He had **a** supercomputer, not necessarily TOP500 worthy. A rackful of SGI blades would cost under $1M. It would be enough for students, but for SGI that would be just business as usual not worthy of special mentions.

That's for a 100 TFLOPS. His C01N claims theoretical peak of 4470 TFLOPS. 44*$700k would give about $30M for the hardware itself, not accounting for all the housing and infrastructure costs.

What's a 21 Inc "chip" and what could it do that can't be done by the brains of any IoT device?

I thought we were talking about *ignoring* ads? That's not quite the same thing as blocking them, I assure you.
Ignoring ads still gives site owners those precious impressions and helps keep things free. Blocking them generally doesn't.

Many more people use "general purpose insecure devices" without hardware wallets for Bitcoin, and it seems to work just fine for them. Isn't "too insecure" a little bit alarmist here?
Trezor also doesn't cost $300, and even assuming you'd pay that much for pre-installation, nowhere in 21's materials are there mentions of 21's Chip being anything more than miner. In fact, only mention of "security" I found is in context of potential insecurity of running remotely accessible services. Where do your claims of it being more secure come from?
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:27:39
That's actually "21 things to build with any computer, Internet access and 21 Inc.'s services account".
Did anyone figure out why they need you to buy this "devkit" instead of just signing up for SDK?

(Almost) no one runs ad campaigns on their own, everyone uses ad networks for advertisement. In context of Internet, you can only meaningfully speak about such ad networks as legitimate or not.
Even legitimate ad networks fall victim to malvertisements all the time - just google for "yahoo ads malware" for a few examples, including some very recent ones.

I said, "selling ... recompiled". Not "telling people to recompile". Most people know how to download and install programs.
That's the point, if the chip is not required, you don't need *any* special hardware. If it *is* required, this device will live exactly long enough for someone to launch an open alternative (note: "open" as in "openly available", not necessarily "free" or "open source").

I have some BTC. I also have an RPi2 serving files and doing some small chores around my house. What is it do you think I won't be able to do with my setup after I get my hands on their software when it's released?
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:35:39
Yeah, and they'll feel cheated when it "runs out of juice" as difficulty raises, and to add insult to injury they find out "convenient" meant basically paying double the price for each Bitcoin on top of price of the miner.
Consumer mining like this was way too expensive for a long time already, and will be way too expensive until difficulty flat-lines. Until then, whatever small miner they provide for convenience will not last and will have to be replaced somewhere in 6 mo-1 year range. Is replacing the miner chip convenient for mainstream persons?
Unless using 21 Inc's services *requires* buying this device, it will be like buying $20 bottled water to water your plants.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:01:07
Its only valid purpose is being $400 license to use 21's software. You could've saved $200 if they'd just sell it separately.
All hardware parts can be emulated by software both for service and client developers.
This hardware is also obviously not something you would integrate anywhere. More than that - you don't need a "Bitcoin chip" to access Bitcoin network. You only need CPU and network access for that, and any device smart enough to be called a part of IoT will already have those. If you want your IoT gadget to use 21 Inc's micropayments, you only need software libraries.
A mining hub that "charges up" other devices in your household with Bitcoin, especially small devices like smartphones, could be a part of such BTC micropayments fueled future. But, again, this is not something you need if you want to develop and prototype today.
TL;DR: just give me the APIs to play around with, dammit.

This isn't Yahoo's business practice, this is Yahoo's (piss poor) security practice. Yahoo is not an innocent bystander here. Would you go to a McDonalds if there was a hundred recent cases of salmonella linked directly to them and just go "this isn't their business practice to poison customers; are you saying we should just eliminate the fast food restaurants?"
Online ads are an infection vector least dependent on the user and with widest reach. After I heard of yesterday's Imgur malware problems, I just stopped visiting them for a while, but infected Yahoo ad makes half of the Internet a minefield. Which site I visit uses their ads? Which one will drop me a fresh 0-day exploit? Guess! Or stop using Internet! Or block the Yahoo Ads, your choice.

Do you have a Bitcoin wallet on your PC and/or phone? Did you need to add any "small devices" to do that, or were they already good enough to access Bitcoin network?

This is buying a second PC just for the sake of using eBay, packaged with an overpriced and outdated prepaid Internet plan, for convenience.
Both PC and Macs are general purpose devices. Apple's hardware and software are also pretty unique. This one has a single purpose and doesn't provide anything that wouldn't be possible by a purely software upgrade to any existing computer. Remember, "it's not a miner"?
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:48:22
Developer wouldn't need, and actually wouldn't *want* Bitcoin for development. Why would you stick real money in while you're not finished debugging your stuff? Developers just need a testnet that can virtually pay as much as needed to the service they debug.
There's nothing in this hardware that couldn't be provided to developer by a software mock-up.
PS: To start developing for Apple you only need Apple ID, publishing is not free though. Developing for Android doesn't even require having any Android devices or a Google account.

First bullet point in Amazon listing:










Yeah, why would anyone think you can actually mine with it?

Do they have "Potentially Unwanted Apps" category? If they do - yes, miscategorizing like that isn't nice at all. If they don't - description of what trojans do is correct. If they usually see Bitcoin miners as a part of a trojan package, there's *some* logic to what they did.
AV companies usually try to trump up the danger in their press releases about new found threats in the wild, not in help pages. Consider this: you were running their antivirus and got this. If you know what a Bitcoin miner is, they've just lost a customer, if you don't - you are most likely actually infected with a mining trojan. There's no sense for them to do this maliciously, just incompetently. Where do they put things like TOR or VNC, I wonder, or do they just skip them?
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:38:12
Or you can ask for some coins from testnet faucets, or a new testnet can be spun up.
This is as rational of a fear as "That is until the fan fails and mining ASIC bursts in flames. Then you may have to wait a while until replacement arrives"
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:50:03
It's obviously a template page generated for everything in the threats database.


Bit about "these kinds of threats called Trojan Horses" corroborates that.
This kind of pages served as "find out more" are frustrating in their lack of actual information (just try finding out what some trojan you found does and stores on your PC on any AV soft vendor's site!), but not malicious as you seem to imply.
@_date: 2015-09-23 22:42:53
Developers, innovators, prototypers and integrators only need the software part of this package, modified to use a testnet instead of livenet.

Oh, ok. Second part of my comment still stands. Unlike ignoring, too many blockers might make chumps less disposed to pay for your browsing habits.

Hardware wallets DO provide an added bit of functionality, nice, but not crucial. So far, nothing 21 said or shown points to this being included, though.
So, you're saying this is Trezor, at double or triple the price, and also 21 forgot to even hint at this feature anywhere in their product pages?
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:10:20
Why do they need an ASIC and in what way, software or hardware, does it have to be compatible? Does the ASIC in this rig look like something you'd integrate into anything portable?
I thought it was pretty clearly established, even by 21 Inc themselves, that mining is just a secondary function there to let microtransactions get mined for a trickle of BTC in exchange. If you want to mine in that pool, you only need to know the network protocol their pool uses.
But the important part of this is 21 Inc's network used to facilitate publishing, operation and discovery of those micropayment services. Unless 21 gates the access to it with some sort of proprietary hardware DRM, all you need is any CPU and TCP/IP stack.
If they do use such a DRM, I don't think you have much of a leeway in your custom rigs, anyways, and the future of their services is questionable. I really doubt they'd follow this route.

Until we get to real AI and machine self-ownership, there will be a human owning them who can go to an exchange or a meatspace bitcoin dealer etc. and provide the machine with Bitcoin. Setting up recurring payment to your machines' wallets and an alert on cash running low should not be a problem, especially if you can make a single device or service manage payments for the rest of your net.
Any fixed mining chip will be obsoleted, so you're looking at (a) effectively buying Bitcoin way over market price and (b) having to replace either the chip or whole device when mining not only falls behind electricity prices but stops providing enough satoshis for the services your machine needs to purchase.
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:02:49
... At which point it becomes $50 Raspberry Pi 2, $350 license to use 21's software and a small space heater.
If the chip is unnecessary, whole package can be replaced by selling the software recompiled for other OSes and/or subscription to their service.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:01:29
Their site was recently updated and they explain it [here](
TL;DR: they seem to position off-chain transactions through 21.co's service as primary, with on-chain as option and payment channel-type payments in the works.
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:53:13
But this is *not* efficient. At all. Any improvements in energy efficiency will be incorporated by big mining pools as well. Small devices where you'd want micropayments the most will never be able to compete.
The only realistic hardware plan is a mining hub in one or two big, always-on devices with good heat dissipation. All the other devices only need software and small doses of Bitcoin provided ~~by the hub~~ by any means to obtain Bitcoin. ^(If this kind of micropayments gets popular, that'd make a nice market for prepaid Bitcoin cards, for example.)
This device could be a prototype of such hub, but it definitely is not something a developer needs.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:15:56
Internet of things already separates devices in multiple roles, with simpler, smaller devices bound together and controlled by smarter ones. A new role, payment hub, externally loaded with BTC, would make a lot more sense than a mining chip in every device.
Smaller devices will need Bitcoin infusion to get anything useful done, in any case. With constantly growing difficulty, such chip is an embodiment of planned obsolescence and convenience tax, pretty big one at that.
It sounds really ambivalent: on one hand, he believes in Bitcoin being used in every facet of life AND at the same time, procuring Bitcoin is an inconvenience. You can already get your wages paid in Bitcoin, FFS. If Bitcoin is to be so prevalent, it will already be on people's credit cards and in prepaid cards on every gas station.
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:58:49


Wut. That's exactly how it was done for years until appearance of ASIC miners, and that's how you can still do it to **develop** stuff using testnet.
