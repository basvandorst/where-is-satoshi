These things have been gone over time and again. If you still haven't heard or disagree with the answers to these questions, then I *don't* think you should get involved in bitcoins right now. It doesn't sound like the right fit for you. Wait until bitcoin is mature and stable: you won't make a speculative profit but you'll be safe.

People who can use bitcoin want people who can't use bitcoin to become able to use bitcoin, so that bitcoin grows.

If you fail to report income you made from illegal activities, it is a separate crime that you can be charged with. The feds could not get enough evidence to convict Al Capone of illegal activities, but they did get enough to prove that he made income that he did not report. 
Potentially the same thing could happen if someone, for example, sold drugs for bitcoins, then exchanged the bitcoins for dollars, then failed to report the dollars as income on their tax forms. Even if the prosecutor couldn't prove the drug deal went down, if he could prove the exchange to dollars happened he could pin the person with failure to report income.

Well also the cycles are changing all the time. You could set up a temporary cashless cycle but as soon as someone wanted out you'd need to redo everything.

True, it is a removal of potential effect, rather than a direct effect as with the seller. Nevertheless, I'd argue that future prices would still be different than if the miner had held onto his coins.

Sorry, how does this work? How do you know they don't have a bank account with a completely different entity? That seems to be the issue you're taking with anonymous bitcoin: that even if they show you their private account, you still don't know if they have other private accounts. But surely the same is true with cash accounts. I mean, they could be stuffing the cash into a sack in the back room for all you know.

Well, that's true if the only thing you care about is the exchange rate of bitcoin. But in terms of a healthy bitcoin economy, new merchants is definitely a good thing.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:43:56
It affects the price because the buyer who would have bought on the exchange--raising the price--is now buying off-exchange. Doing a transaction off the exchange removes *both* the seller and the buyer, not just the seller.

I know past performance doesn't guarantee future results, etc., but if you look at a [logarithmic chart]( of bitcoin value, there's a very regular periodicity to the bubbles. *If* (a big if) that trend continues, we are near the bottom of a dip between bubbles, and would expect to see another bubble in June and July.

Sure, but hopefully those payment processors will also be cryptographically secure. I'm always floored by how easy it is to get away with credit card fraud.

It's possible this is just to explicitly clarify that it is legal. Alternative currencies have always been on shaky legal ground.

Did you read the post? This is a bitcoin advocate looking for ideas, not a detractor.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:16:40
If 3600 coins sold on the marketplace daily would depress the price, those same coins sold "off the marketplace" (whatever that means) would do the same. The demand on the marketplace is affected by the total demand: someone who is able to buy "off the marketplace" is someone who isn't buying on it. Therefore your premise must be incorrect: the mining rate wouldn't change the price because it *already* affects the price.

That could be true for $100k but not for $10m. If you've got 50btc, there's no realistic way to spend even half of those on actual consumption. Now you'd probably diversify, but I wouldn't be surprised if some people held on to double-digits.

As I understood it we weren’t talking about someone somewhere but the same people who originally defrauded him.
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:26:10
Should he, though? If he did his previous job well and didn't get paid (the pension), why not get paid for not doing this one well? That way it equals out (not really, because he shouldn't have to work at all, but at least it brings it closer to equal).
@_date: 2019-11-17 16:28:24
I’m pretty sure the actual reason is because you came across as saying he would owe some ethical responsibility to those who defrauded him.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:04:39
I think it’s just this general attitude that people deserve whatever mistreatment they get and ignoring the extreme imbalance of power between the corporations and the employees that’s rubbing people the wrong way. People have realized that you get nothing, literally nothing from loyalty to companies, and they will do whatever unethical thing they can to exploit you to the fullest. So there’s really no reason to go to any extra effort beyond whatever you need to do to fool them into thinking you’re doing your job. 
The fact that you seem to be attacking the worker while ignoring the bad conduct of the companies seems hypocritical and undercuts any ethical credibility of your arguments. The main problem in employment is not that employees aren’t doing their jobs well. It’s that companies are exploiting their employees. Until you solve that issue any argument you make in favor of companies is ethically and rhetorically empty.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:39:10
So you’d hold him to ethical standards but you don’t care if corporations do unethical things to him.

Yes, but they require you to trust the escrow service itself not to simply abscond with your money. With a third-party transaction, the third party would not have access to the money, they would only be able to give it to either A or B.

We already do that, actually. It's just done on an edge and really small so it's not noticable.
@_date: 2011-05-17 19:03:34
The main problem is that right now there aren't very many things you can buy with bitcoins. So their primary value is in exchanging them to dollars.
This store would help solve that, even if there's an implied dollar value, because the transactions are actually carried out entirely by bitcoin (in my understanding). Presumably as more of these open up, the importance of the dollar value will be reduced and they can start simply listing bitcoin prices, making them entirely divorced from dollars.
@_date: 2011-05-27 23:05:04

Personally, I wrote a program that runs my miner as a screensaver, although that prevents it from running when you're doing non-gaming stuff as well. But there's really no way to automatically "prioritize" your GPU so that it runs as much as possible but doesn't take performance from other applications. You have to compromise on either not making the most of your mining or doing it manually.
@_date: 2011-05-17 18:48:02
Well, at 10 billion population, that's enough for everyone to have on the order of 10,000 distinct units of value. That does seem low (10,000 pennies is only $100) but it could work. It would probably have been better to have a few orders of magnitude of leeway, though.

But people have been talking about a bubble for months now, and with bitcoin's volatility you'd expect it to have popped by now...
@_date: 2011-06-01 22:22:12
The problem is that it isn't useless. It's used to establish the cryptographic security that is the basis of the currency. If we were just making people spin their computer cycles, then yes, it would be easy to repurpose that to run folding or something, but the work that miners are doing is actually very specific and it would be quite difficult to come up with an application that would do both with the same computations.
@_date: 2011-06-09 06:18:29
What the currency market did was allow a bunch of new people who had never heard of bitcoins, can't or don't know how to mine, and don't have easily available goods or services to offer to get in on the bitcoin economy, building activity and publicity. That means that people who *are* able to accept bitcoins for their goods and services now have an actual market to sell to, rather than just a few nerds (OK, it's probably still mostly nerds, but at least there's a lot more of them). It's true that we're going through a period of major instability, but it's also a period of major growth, and hopefully when things settle down, that will result in a much larger economy which will allow us to bootstrap much more quickly and easily. The lifeblood of a currency is having a lot of people who accept it, and now we are starting to have a lot of people interested.

Personally, I think bitcoins are overvalued right now, but I plan on keeping my bitcoins even if there is a "burst", because my confidence in the currency isn't based on speculation but on the inherent value of a cryptographically strong decentralized online currency.
All my BTC so far is from mining anyway, so it's not like I stand to lose a big investment.

@_date: 2011-06-15 21:24:39
You're right, but I think it's much easier to determine C and B (or C and A, if you're B) aren't in cahoots than it is to ensure C won't just take the money.
I feel like established escrow services based on holding your money for you are too centralized and powerful; they're basically banks.
@_date: 2011-07-15 20:16:46
Well, basically it's used for everything. This is the actual code that gets stored in transaction blocks. It's like Assembly code for bitcoin. Right now, though, most (all?) clients just hardcode a few simple transaction types like the standard transfer and the block generation. I haven't looked at your client code, so I don't know exactly how you do it, but somewhere in your code or a library is the code to actually create and send a transaction, and this script is in there.
Allowing arbitrary scripts--in other words, allowing the user to create their own transaction types--would allow for more complex transactions like a transfer of funds that required a third party to sign off before the transfer was completed, or encrypting data within the transaction. Or even group transfers that required each member to contribute a certain amount before it would actually transfer the money. Basically, whatever you can imagine.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:10:45
This is the main problem I see with bitcoin at the moment. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 06:22:48
Most bitcoin transactions take several minutes at least to propogate through the net, especially if you're not including a transaction fee (which I doubt MtGox is). Nevertheless, unless someone is specifically targeting your transaction, it's pretty much guaranteed to go through as soon as it's sent, the waiting is just for the confirmation. It can't be reversed once done.

With this, your computer will start mining automatically whenever you're not using it, and stop when you come back. Of course, that would be silly for dedicated rigs, but I thought it would be helpful to "casual" miners who also use their computer for other stuff.

These were the first two comments to this thread.
@_date: 2011-07-15 19:25:31
Cool, thanks. It's pretty obscure, not even the official client really supports it (though the network is set up to allow it). But I consider it extremely useful--almost vital--for the future of bitcoin in actual business transactions.
@_date: 2011-06-08 21:56:36
I don't really care what you call it. But it would only be a bad thing if the people buying bitcoins lose all their money. If bitcoins go on to be a successful currency, everybody's happy.
To expand on that, there are two models bitcoins could follow right now. The first is the one you're afraid of, which goes like this: bitcoin founders get a bunch of people to give them money in exchange for (intrinsically) worthless items on the expectation that they will be able to turn around and sell those items for more money later. However, once the founders get their money, the items lose all value and all the latecomers lose everything. So basically the founders got a bunch of money for nothing. That's bad.
The second model is like this: bitcoin founders create a bunch of items that *do* have some intrinsic value, as if they were producing widgets in a factory. They sell those items to other people. However, because those items have value, the people didn't give their money for nothing. They get to use the items they bought. That's good.
The difference between the two models is whether you believe bitcoins have intrinsic value or are just a basis for speculation. Personally, I believe they do: they are useful in decentralized, pseudononymous online transactions. Thus, I think the people paying money to the founders are getting what they want: items that can be safely and easily traded online. If you don't believe that, then you should certainly not be putting any money into speculation. It remains to be seen which of us is right.

@_date: 2011-06-08 01:00:18
Well, if you had any bitcoins, they have approximately gained 30x in value over the last two months. So, for example, if I had $25 worth of bitcoins two months ago, and simply held onto them, I could now sell them for roughly $750 if I wished.

It will suffer the same problems as trying to break into the "social networking website" business: in order to succeed, what's important isn't the product, it's the community. Bitcoin now has by far the most established community, so unless everyone suddenly decides they don't like bitcoin anymore (which, to be fair, is possible if something *really* cool comes along, like Facebook vs Myspace), it's gonna be a steep uphill battle for any new challengers.
@_date: 2011-06-08 16:23:55

I did a similar napkin calculation for dollars and came up with something in the same general order of magnitude, so that sounds about right. If bitcoin takes off, it's definitely going to go way up in value due to the simple fact that there's only 21 million (less, now) to go around.
@_date: 2011-06-15 23:02:49
If you're in a pool, you don't have to have a beast rig to make a profit. You may not pull in much, but as long as your profit is positive, it's worth while. Even if you only make 0.1 BTC per day, that's worth $2, which is probably more than the electricity you use. Plus, of course, if you think BTC value is on it's way up then you could totally clean up. Back when bitcoins were worth under $1, mining was barely profitable, but if you kept your coins from back then you'd have a huge profit.
@_date: 2011-06-10 21:44:52
Regardless of what regulations they put in place on exchanges, you can still go hand someone some cash and have them send you some bitcoins. So I don't think this changes their fundamental nature, it just means the government is gonna try to regulate the big markets instead of cracking down on the currency itself. That's probably a good thing.
@_date: 2011-05-17 18:36:22
I've wondered about that myself. Bitcoin data is already taking up about 300 MB for me; with the expanding economy, that volume is only going to increase exponentially, in my understanding.
Maybe the protocol can be updated to include some kind of storage distribution scheme that allows for multiple redundancy but doesn't require every user to store the whole data set.
@_date: 2011-06-08 06:02:53

C (I assume that's who you mean) would probably get a fee in a separate transaction.
Also, having the third-party transaction like this *is* (paradoxically) an attempt at minimizing the man in the middle. Without such a transaction, if you want to do escrow-type transactions you have to just send your money to the man in the middle and he can do whatever he wants with it. Third-party transactions limit what C can do.
@_date: 2011-06-08 01:23:15
You're not, this is a bubble and it will crash. However, bitcoins on the whole do have a value as a distributed electronic currency. I wouldn't encourage speculation on the hope that bitcoins will continue to increase in value, but I would encourage modest adoption of the currency for the purpose of making easy and secure transactions online. Sort of like some people trade dollars and yen and euros on currency markets, but a lot more people simply use them for daily transactions.

I think this is a terminology issue. The question seems to be: a loss compared to *what*? If it's based on his decision to invest in bitcoins, then it's compared to what he had before investing. If it's based on his decision not to cash out at the peak, then it's compared to the $1500 richer he could have been.
Personally, I'd say the primary decision he made was whether to invest or not in the first place, since the decision on when to cash out is basically unpredictable. He could just as easily see a *gain* of $1500 over current values by choosing not to cash out until/if bitcoins get up to $50. Since there's really no way to know what the future holds in such a volatile market, treating temporary fluctuations as gains and losses really doesn't help anyone make decisions. So it makes more sense to measure "true" gains and losses relative to the initial decision to invest.
@_date: 2011-06-02 06:42:00
It shows basically what you'd see running the program from the command line. In the case of most mining programs, that's a hashes per second plus any accepted/rejected blocks.
@_date: 2011-06-09 06:39:09
How much do you know about hashing? Basically, a hash function takes a number and returns what looks like a totally random other number (but it's the same output every time you feed it the same input). Now, Bitcoin uses these these input-output pairs to "sign" transaction blocks, because you can only create the output number from the hash if you know the input number (there's no way to work backwards from an output number to find the input number that would produce it). Specifically, Bitcoin looks for output numbers with a certain number of zeros in front (this is an easy way to make sure very few output numbers match their criteria; they can also vary how many zeros they want to make it more or less difficult). So basically your computer is feeding input numbers, one after one, into the hash function to see if any of them produces an output with a bunch of zeros in front. If it does, you send the input number to the bitcoin network to secure a transaction block with, and the bitcoin network credits you 50BTC for your work.
Pooled mining, by the way, works by having you send the pool server all your hash pairs that have a certain number of zeros that is *less* than the number required for bitcoin (the server also ensures that all the miners are working on different sections of input numbers so that they don't duplicate each others' work). The pool server then sorts through all the pairs returned to see if any of them has enough zeros to be a bitcoin block hash, and if so it distributes the 50BTC reward among the miners based on how many hash pairs they each turned in.

I have set it up to run as a screensaver on my computer, so it doesn't slow it down when I'm using it. I used to do about 0.8 bitcoins per day but with the current explosion I'm doing more like 0.3.

That's what I assumed as well. He has about 3k btc, which is worth $400k on today's market.
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:22:51
That $30-60 trillion figure is probably based on M1 (includes checking accounts) or M2 (includes all bank accounts), whereas bitcoin is essentially an M0 currency (only hard cash). The worldwide total for M0 seems to be [about $5 trillion]( meaning if every country switched exclusively to btc each would be worth about $250k. Now you can see why the $200k figure starts looking unlikely in the foreseeable future. Having bitcoin account for just one percent of total world currency value would be an astounding success, but would only give it a value of about $2.5k. Right now we can posit that it accounts for about 0.03% of that figure.

Yes, but given the legal and political history surrounding "bad data" issues, that is not likely to be an effective defense.

The number is practically meaningless, but what *would* be worthwhile is figuring out *why* the exchanges that fail do so. Is it DDoSes? Hacking (not the same thing)? Closed bank accounts? Criminal charges? Couldn't make a profit? Etc. If we know what's causing exchanges to fail, we can work on exchanges that will be resilient to those challenges.
The article seems to indicate that hacking is the primary cause, which makes me think all we really need is more secure programming, which is essentially a solved problem in the financial sector already. I have multiple accounts with fiat money that I can access online, with no fear that they will be hacked and the money stolen. So all we need is for people to use the same best practices on bitcoin exchanges that are already in use by banks and processors like Paypal.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:44:40

There's a major effective difference, in that it encourages more merchants to accept bitcoins. The reason merchants currently just sell their bitcoins for dollars is that the economy hasn't yet reached the critical mass where the merchants can spend bitcoins on the stuff they need, completing the economic loop. The way that will happen is by encouraging more merchants to accept bitcoin, and we're back to the beginning.
So yes, every bitcoin purchase that isn't just a direct exchange for fiat money is bringing us one step closer to a fully-functional economy that doesn't rely on fiat exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:02:59
Diversify. They each have strengths and weaknesses. One of the strengths of bitcoin is that there are now many places (and more every day) that accept bitcoins as direct payment, whereas with gold you will have to sell it for fiat before you can buy things. However, one of its current weaknesses is its uncertainty and volatility (although gold is pretty volatile itself right now). By diversifying, you get some of the strengths of each while mitigating some of the weaknesses. It's a way to combat high volatility, especially.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:50:08

@_date: 2013-04-09 00:46:03
Fair enough. It's certainly possible that bitcoins will be overtaken by a superior currency. But I think one of the current advantages it has is that it's the oldest and most widely-known. That won't prevent it from being superseded, but it means the process will be slow and public, giving ample opportunity to switch currencies for anyone "in the know" (as we early adopters certainly are).

I would argue the opposite, actually: it leads to an entitlement mentality. There are some jobs that just aren't fun to do no matter how you dress them up. But somebody has to do them. So we pay people enough money to compensate them for the unpleasant experience. If everyone took the view that you should only do jobs you would enjoy without compensation, some necessary jobs wouldn't get done.

Except if you tell someone that his bitcoins are "unstealable" and then they get stolen, he's never going to use them again. Whereas if you emphasize they're just like cash--which can easily be stolen if you don't secure it--and they get stolen, he might blame it on chance or his habits and keep using them.
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:03:36
So would you say that ordinary people shouldn't ever have more than a couple hundred USD worth of bitcoin? One of the reasons cash being insecure is not a problem is that most people don't have a significant portion of their wealth in it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:17:25
The problem with that is that we get the same problem we currently have with denominating things in bitcoins, only the other way around.
People are generally comfortable denominating things in values from about 0.01 to 9999. Anything outside that range requires extra mental effort.
Right now, if you want to buy something for $5, that's 0.007 btc. It's starting to get uncomfortable. However, if we were to switch to satoshi, then that same transaction would be 714,000 stc, which is even *more* uncomfortable. Millibitcoins, on the other hand, would give 7 mbc, just right. 
Even if bitcoins blew up again to, say, $5k, one mbc would be $5. $5 would be 0.001 btc, and 100,000 stc, with the same problems as before. Satoshi only become usable when bitcoin goes up into the $100k range, which at this point is pretty speculative.
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:17:29
Doesn't make much sense to me. "Bitcoin will increase in value, leading to hoarding, leading to a decrease in value." OK, and won't the decrease in value lead to spending? Sounds like that's a problem that fixes itself.
@_date: 2013-05-07 21:34:39
You're thinking about the absolute difficulty, which is a totally different thing (also incredibly difficult, but that's another story). What actually matters is the *relative* difficulty between hashing private keys vs. hashing blocks compared to the relative expected value of each. Right now that difference is about 1 x 10^60 (actually slightly higher). Let's say that we're in some unforeseeable future where you only get 1 satoshi for hashing a block. Then hashing the private key on an account containing all the bitcoins in the world would be 2 x 10^15 times as rewarding as hashing a block. That means that in order for switching to hashing that account to be worthwhile, the difficulty (roughly an approximation of the world's total mining power) would have to be 5 x 10^44 times as high as it is now. If the network grew at a rate double that of Moore's Law (2x every 1.5 years), it would take ~~223~~ 111 years to reach that point. 
Remember, this is the best case scenario where you can recover all ~20 million bitcoins versus earning a single satoshi. In reality, the block reward is unlikely to fall below about a millionth of the average account at most, *and* it would increase (and the block difficulty would fall) if people started switching their mining rigs over to private key hashing. This also assumes we don't see it coming and switch over to SHA-512 or something. It also assumes you can get away without being caught.

This guy has a weird definition of ownership. He seems to think that if someone stronger than you can take something away, you don't own it. It is a "might makes right" theory of property. However, such a definition (in addition to being ethically repugnant) doesn't seem very useful to me since everything (even life) could theoretically be taken away from anyone, thus it can be reasoned that no one really owns anything.
I would propose that ownership is actually based on a claim to authority that makes it unethical for others to take your property away (or tell you what to do with it) even if they are physically able to do so. Under such a definition, it's actually possible for you to be the current owner of something but lose it in the future due to your actions (or lack thereof) in a completely unrelated area such as not paying taxes or murdering someone. In those cases your actions in other areas demonstrate that you don't have the ethical authority for others to respect your claim on the property. I think this is more in line with how most people think and act toward ownership, and thus is a more useful definition.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:44:56
I'd need to see some source on that. As far as I'm aware, you can call yourself a currency exchanger, comply with all the regulations, and then never complete a single transaction and you're still perfectly legal. It's only the other way--doing exchanges without complying--that's illegal.

@_date: 2013-04-09 20:05:17
True, but as the number of people holding bitcoins increases, so does the *potential* economy size. Also the publicity gets the interest of businesses who want to accept bitcoin payments. Once the deflationary spiral slows, people will be looking to unload (read "spend") their bitcoins, and the economy will hopefully pick up. Of course, this is all theoretical because it's never happened before, but it makes sense to me. Even with the admittedly crazy current deflation, there is a fair bit of spending going on; I can only imagine how much that will increase if the value stops skyrocketing.
In my napkin calculations, the lower limit for the exchange rate of a semi-saturated healthy bitcoin market is about $500 (based on established online exchanges like Amazon and Paypal), so even if we're currently in a speculative bubble, it's not unreasonable to expect the economy to catch up before any huge crashes. I doubt we'll see sub-$20 rates again.

They will eventually have to do something with the bitcoins they exchange for dollars. Most likely, they will sell them on exchanges themselves. Regardless, it acts as an accelerant on the bitcoin economy, as both bitcoins and goods are changing hands in the transactions.

@_date: 2013-11-20 18:23:43


No it's not. Let's say a government somehow manages to get their hands on all but 1000 of the 21 million bitcoins. Each of those 1000 bitcoins can be split into 100 million "satoshi", for a total of 100 billion units. That's not ideal--the minimum unit might then be worth 10 or 25 cents, making it hard to do microtransactions--but still completely usable. And that's just with the current implementation. There's nothing to prevent someone rewriting the protocol to allow microsatoshi or something.
The only thing trying to "corner the market" on bitcoin does is spend lots of money and drive up the value.

Bitcoin **IS** a product. It's just as much a product as a Western Union money order is. People buy it in order to facilitate online transactions. I'm tired of people trying to introduce some arbitrary distinction between "productive" companies and bitcoin. Bitcoin is useful and has an inherent value beyond speculation. If you don't see that, then you don't actually understand bitcoin; you're just like the people who mindlessly buy in because they see the price rising and want to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:53:28
The price would shoot way, way up. Everyone talking about thousands per bitcoin would turn out to be huge pessimists. Millions or more. The bank would then have the vast majority of liquid bitcoins (ie. those that can actually be traded, others being lost or saved by people who can't/won't trade). Then either people will start using 0.0000001 bitcoins as their units of exchange, or bitcoin will fail. However, all those people who sold to the bank would be super rich, so someone would just start another bitcoin protocol virtually identical, and it would all happen again.

Not really, try switching to &gt; .001. The vast majority of addresses in the original chart were used once and discarded with zero balance; they don't correspond to people.

You can't, not securely. Bitcoins were never intended to be an offline currency, nor were they intended to be your sole store of liquid wealth. They are for secure, distributed online transactions. They fill a niche that dollars can't, and dollars fill a niche that bitcoins can't.

Well, funny you should say that. A "bit" *was* actually a colloquialism referring to money: it was an eighth of a dollar (a "piece of eight"). Hence the old "Shave and a haircut: two bits". My guess is that most people would actually relate to that usage or just the general idea of a bit being a small piece, rather than the binary digit "nerdy" meaning.

The law isn't like programming or math. It's not a set of absolute rules that are either followed or not in a binary value. It depends on "fuzzy" concepts like intentions and spirit of the law, and each case requires a separate opinion. That's why we have courts with judges and juries instead of simply feeding the data into a computer or something.
Your argument here amounts to "Mt. Gox was following the letter of the law until the ruling, therefore they should have been given leeway to comply after it." But you're ignoring that they weren't following the spirit of the law: even before the ruling clarified it, it's pretty clear that Mt. Gox *was* running a currency exchange by *our* definition. We all know that bitcoin is a currency, and Mt. Gox is an exchange. Even before the ruling, when it wasn't explicit that the law applied to them, common sense implied it *should* have. But Mt. Gox tried to use a loophole to get out of it, gambling that the government would use a strict interpretation. So then why should FinCEN have to give them the benefit of the doubt as though they were legitimately blindsided by the concept?

When you mine a hash, you essentially get a random number. Let's pretend it's a random number between zero and 1000. If you get a number less than, say, 20, you "win". Now, when the difficulty increases, the target number goes down. So now you have to get a number less than 18 to win. Since there are fewer numbers between 0 and 18 than there are between 0 and 20, it's less likely you'll get one.

This is simplistic, real investments don't look like sine waves. They look chaotic. They're unpredictable. You don't know if the current low/high is an actual limit or just a bulge/dip in a larger trend. There are only two ways to make money on an investment: be better at researching and knowing what affects your investments than most other investors (watch out for Dunning-Kruger), or stick with a safe bet for the long haul.

I think you missed the main point of my comment. The question is not whether it is *ethical* for someone to take something from you, but whether it still counts as *ownership* on your part of what was taken. Your point in the article appeared to be that you can't "truly" own something if it can be taken from you (e.g. for non-payment of taxes). 
I contend that you *can* own something that can (ethically or not) be taken from you, because it's not the bare fact of your ability to hold it that gives you ownership, but rather your *authority* to do so, based on your interactions with others. You make a claim of ownership on something and then society decides whether that claim is valid (they will help you protect that claim) or not (they will protect whoever they believe deserves it from *you*). The fact that you have to pay taxes on your land doesn't mean you don't own it, it simply means that society has placed a condition on their acceptance of your claim to ownership.

I believe escrow is actually built into the bitcoin protocol, it's just not supported by any clients/miners (or wasn't when I looked into it a long time ago). Basically, you can specify multi-party transactions, that only complete (or refund) if confirmed by a certain number of parties. So you send the money to your recipient, but put the escrow service as a signer. Then the recipient can see the transaction, but only gets the money when the escrow service signs off.

In bitcoin, there are addresses and private keys. If you have a private key, it is very easy to figure out the address associated with it. But if you have an address, it's very hard (basically impossible) to figure out the private key associated with it. You can send bitcoins to an address, but you can't take bitcoins out of an address unless you have the private key.
A "brain wallet" is thinking up your own private key using normal words (e.g. "purple monkey dishwasher") and figuring out which address goes with that private key. Then you send bitcoins to that address, and when you want to spend them you just use the private key you memorized.
Brain wallets are a bad idea because it's a lot easier to guess something that someone else thought up than to guess a totally random private key like "914B8u3LZ56N5P8M79t8".

If it starts becoming a widely accepted currency, you very well could. Instead of "cashing out", you would just using the bitcoin directly to buy stuff. And when you get paid you can either get it directly in bitcoin or convert the bulk of it to bitcoin. You could conceivably go the rest of your life without ever converting another satoshi to dollars and still receive the rewards of investing in bitcoin.

To explore this more fully, let's say every person on earth generates a million new addresses every millisecond. Then it would take 6.6 billion billion millenia (that's right, a billion times a billion times a thousand years) to run out. It would take 600 trillion millenia before you had a 0.01% chance of generating a duplicate address. 
It would take something like 4 trillion years before *any one* of the 2.5 billion billion addresses you'd generate in your lifetime had a 0.01% chance of being a duplicate.

On  mining for a private key would be *much, much* harder than mining for a block. How much harder? Well, the hash target is (in hexadecimal): 1DE940000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
That means that any hash found that's less than that number is a successful block. Which means there are about that many possible blocks to be found. If you were to search for a private key, however, you would be looking for a *single* hash match (in other words, the equivalent target would be 1). Even if you were looking for all addresses that had a significant amount in them, you'd only knock a couple of digits off the ratio between the two numbers.

OK, fair enough. I think that people like you who think governments should not have monetary power but should have other forms of power represent a minority in this subreddit, though. In my experience, most people who believe governments shouldn't have monetary power do so from an ideological perspective that governments should have as little power as possible in general. Thus I think it makes sense that people who are interested in bitcoins are likely to be interested in other anti-government subreddits. It's not intended to make a unified statement about the beliefs of those who frequent this subreddit but simply to provide convenience to the majority.
That said, I don't feel strongly about the issue and would understand if the links were taken down so as not to mislead.

Bitcoin is not left or right wing, but it is fundamentally anti-government in that it aims to take away some of the power that governments have over the money supply. Thus it makes sense to list some other subreddits that are fundamentally anti-government. I'd be in favor of adding in some left-leaning anti-government subreddits if you can suggest a few.

It's only optimal if he's right. The optimal strategy is to buy just before it goes up and sell just before it goes down, but that would require prescience.

Only if its popularity of use is *also* growing. A high but steady popularity of use will not counteract an expanding supply; indeed, that's exactly why existing currencies inflate. And of course since the economy itself is limited in size, any expanding currency will eventually begin to inflate as use becomes saturated. The only way to permanently prevent inflation is to limit the total amount of currency available.
However, your other point still holds: that Satoshi could have chosen a different release schedule such that only a few coins were released at the beginning, and more were released as its popularity expanded. There are two reasons I've heard for why he chose otherwise. The first is that a base amount needed to get into circulation quickly so that there was enough for people to actually use. The second was to encourage adoption. He wanted people to feel an urge to get in early, so that the bitcoin economy would grow to a usable size. The only thing worse than a currency held mostly by a few people is a currency in which nothing is for sale. So basically in order to "jump start" the bitcoin economy, there had to be advantages for people who bought in quickly; otherwise bitcoin would still be a couple of nerds tipping each other.

Bitcoins aren't actually stored as floating point numbers; they're stored as integer numbers of "satoshi", where 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 bitcoin (1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshi). The current way we show bitcoin numbers is just for aesthetics, and can easily be changed: we could say 1 satoshi = 0.00001 "neobitcoin", meaning a neobitcoin would be worth roughly 13 cents. Currently a satoshi is worth 0.00013 cents, and current bitcoins would have to increase in value to over a million dollars before a satoshi was worth more than one cent, so there's plenty of room for growth.

If a single satoshi was worth ten US cents (arguably the limit for spendability in 2013 dollars), the total value of all bitcoins in existence would be $210 trillion. That is roughly the sum total of all wealth on earth, and 200 times as much as there are US dollars in circulation.

I'm pretty sure you misunderstood his question. He's asking why isn't Satoshi spending any bitcoin right now, by pretending that he inherited them from the real Satoshi.
My answer would be that obviously Satoshi places a high priority on his privacy, and doing that would still give him too much association with the Satoshi identity for comfort.

True, in a sense, but currencies *always* start out as a false monopoly, because *someone* has to decide who gets the currency when it's first issued. For US Dollars, that someone is the Fed. For bitcoin, it's the miners. I actually think the bitcoin system is about as fair as you can make it while maintaining some measure of value.
