They could have the oxygen sensor put the readings directly on the block chain, and then the emissions control unit could read them from the block chain (everyone else could, too, you wouldn't even need to go in for smog checks).
If your emissions were too high, your car could be programmed to pay an extra emissions fee in BTC.
This would work for odometers, too - every .1 mile (or kilometer) your odometer would put another marker on the block chain, so you'd never be able to "roll back" an odometer, because a record of your mileage would be stored on computers all over the world. You could even put GPS coordinates in there, too, so that everyone would know where everyone else is (or, at least, their car) all of the time. 
Same thing with those blood sugar meters for diabetics, and blood pressure readers - blockchain! Then your doctor could just pull your stats right off the blockchain, you wouldn't even have to go to the doctor in person any more. They could write you a blockchain prescription that you'd pick up at the pharmacy, but only after you paid with BTC, which your insurance company would pick up from the blockchain and reimburse you automatically, except for your deductible/copay. 
Also, we don't need the Congressional Record any more, we'll just put anything that anyone in Congress says right on the block chain. Same thing with transcripts for trials and public meetings - blockchain! Blockchain!
In the future, kids won't have report cards, the teachers will put their grades on the blockchain in near realtime, so parents can just pull up a report on their smartphone at lunch and see if little Johnny did well on his spelling test after that big glass of kale juice at breakfast. 
When you go out to eat, you don't even need to order any more, you just pay right on the blockchain, and put your order in the menu field - then the kitchen can see exactly who ordered exactly what and in what order, so everyone gets their food in the order they paid for it, and there's no running out on the check. Tips would also be on the blockchain, which would replace Yelp! - instead of having ratings, you could just see how big the tips were for a particular restaurant/server. 
Blockchain! Blockchain all of the things!

You send .01, .1, or 1 BTC (depending on how strong your ownership claim is) to a special address - 
and in the message field, put your name in brackets and the asset description in braces:

1. Find someone with 1 BTC.
2. Give them $.
3. They send you 1 BTC.
4. Profit!

I have some basic emergency supplies/preparations, but BTC is one of the first things that will stop working, not one of the last things. I have silver coins, ammunition, toilet paper, water, and MRE's in case SHTF.

You seem to be having trouble distinguishing between what's allowed, what's possible, and what's a good idea.

"Casualty loss" is the term you're looking for; the IRS is quite familiar with all sorts of catastrophes that happen to people, including fraud, mismanagement, shitty investments, and everything else.
No, it doesn't get you a free pass, but it might give you a deduction to offset other gains.

I can't find anything on the BitPay site that says they waive fees for nonprofits/charitable orgs. I found a discussion of a press release from Coinbase saying they're waiving fees for 501(c) charities, but the link for the press release now returns a 404 error.

Settle down. People lose records. You may need to get a good tax attorney to help you, but don't assume everything is lost before it even begins.

Yeah, but that assumes that conversion to/from BTC is free, which isn't true. 
Someday if we're all getting paid in BTC and it's possible to pay for many things with BTC, then conversion costs won't be important; until then, this is comparing two things that aren't alike.
If I want to give $100 to a random charity and they use a typical merchant processor, they'll get $97.50 or thereabouts in their bank account, for a discount rate of approx .025. 
I just sent myself a $100 USD invoice with Bitpay - that turns out to be 0.297619 BTC. If I use the cheapest seller on localbitcoins.com who accepts cash deposits, I need to pay that guy   $105.23 USD in order to get the right amount of BTC - and then Bitpay is going to keep 1% of the payment, so the charity will actually get 0.29464281 BTC; at Bitpay's current exchange rate, that's 100.11 USD, for an overall discount rate of .04865, which is worse than most credit card merchant processors.
