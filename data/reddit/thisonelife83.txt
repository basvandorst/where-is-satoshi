I’ve never sold, only bought. Even as recently as last week

I'm not fluent in futures but have been putting in some late hours doing my homework. I am very familiar with options.
Are there different strike prices per se? Will futures contracts be at $9k, $15k, $16k, $20k...etc? Or is a futures contract just that I will trade the value at the expiration date no matter what at the spot price?
Are both parties buyers? And one price is negative? Or is there a buyer and a seller?
Besides the margin that is put up by both buyers/sellers that is settled in cash daily, is there a cost to enter into a contract? Can I be in a futures contract for 3 hours only? Where can I see the price of a futures contract, or do I just choose the side I am entering on and hope it moves directionally the way I chose?
I am curious of the exact mechanics of a typical trade.
For a stock option I can pay for the right, but not obligation, to purchase a stock at a particular strike price. Say I buy an AAPL option for Dec19 with a strike price of $180 and I pay $2.45 for one option ($245). Is this similar to a futures contract. They expire at the end of the month right? I'm assuming there is some time premium for entering into a contract three months away.
Basically can you explain a futures contract from the perspective of a buyer that thinks the price of BTC will continue higher by January 31st?

If you are buying short futures you likely would not enter today, thus preventing volume. You would likely wait for a run higher before entering. When we get those beautiful swings you will probably see the futures volume spike.

Those people insisting on shorting this will be in for some trouble ahead when the price steadily melts higher. 
If the large institutional investors and whales have accumulated a lot of BTC they wouldn't be selling today, but rather they would dump on the Final Settlement Date. They would likely not be buying any  short contracts today, but would wait for some runs higher before entering a position. 
With all of the hype, the volume of the futures so far has been minimal. It will be interesting to see if the contract volume increases rapidly.

Shorts will enter the futures market when there are quick price increases of BTC. Think of it as the opposite of buying the dip; sell the pop.
They will also enter when they think the price is unsustainable or they are about to sell off their BTC to drive the price down. This is probably the best strategy. Buy BTC now at $16k, wait for run higher to $18k, buy tons of short contracts then, sell off your BTC to cause BTC price decline, and finally sell your short contracts for max gains.

One CBOE contract is one BTC, one CME contract will be 5 BTC. Same term periods of expiring each month.

Thanks for sharing

You owe taxes, short term so it's like income, long term gets special rate treatment. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:44:56
This is the correct strategy, but you also need willing buyers to step in during the sell off. I assume there were large investors purchasing BTC, they will purposely try to everything on future expiry dates and reap massive gains from their contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:28:59
Yeah, otherwise the price wouldn't be going up so quickly
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:18:42
Yep ^^

XBT is the term for like BTC to USD. F, G, H correspond to months or something, not sure what the 8 is

That is specific to those banks only, If you trade futures on TD ameritrade then by all means you should have access to this as well.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:41:22
I think the same way. This is my sentiment at least. Buy now at $16k, buy short futures, sell BTC near expiry at $18K to drive price down, sell your futures you bought previously.

This Houston metro flood is the biggest story of the upcoming week. The damage is going to be off the charts. 
Give now to the American Red Cross, this could be a huge humanitarian crisis developing.
Text 'Harvey' to 90999 to donate $10 to the Red Cross.

Whomever thinks the dollar will be replaced by BTC in two years is delusional
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:55
Not complicated, just like reporting a stock transaction.
List needed:
1. Security type (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc) sometimes you need the quantity as well
2. Purchase Date
3. Purchase Price total
4. Sale date
5. Sale price total

These are settled in USD daily aren’t they?

I was attempting to explain BTC to my wife and came to difficult things I did not understand. Could the US government ban BTC? Could they block all of the domains like Coinbase and make bank transfers and credit card purchases of BTC illegal? Would this have a real impact, or is it easy to circumvent or impossible to block effectively.
That is kind of how the US government shut down online poker in 2011/2012, don't recall the year.

Pretty small chance.

I’m a CPA, I don’t mind what you’re buying/selling/making. If you keep good records and have it on spreadsheets or pdf summaries it shouldn’t cost that much. I’d expect 400-600 for a basic tax return with BTC trading, a few brokerage statements, W2, a few 1099s, etc. State taxes might be another 100-200 depending how complicated they are and if you have itemized deductions.
