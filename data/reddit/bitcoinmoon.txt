ok sure, fair point and let's not devolve to an argument. ASICs are a factor, that gave for instance BTCGuild, and GHASH.io the potential to do some devious things if they desired with even ~30% there are some edge cases. The difference there is we're applying ASICs in a fair manner, and ideally access is fair and open to many actors. As we've seen especially with the price melt down, mining has gotten more distributed. However, of course we put faith in the community that miners would use their powers for good.
However, in my point there is a more complex way of causing disruption for financial gain, despite the 51% calculation. Here's an excerpt
"Observe, however, that a smart strategy for an attacker would be to continuously
employ selfish mining attacks, and upon success combine them with
a double spending attack. Technically, this can be done by regularly engaging
in public transactions, while always hiding a conflicting one in the attacker’s
secret blocks. There is always some probability that by the time a successful
selfish mining attack has ended, the payment receiver has already accepted the
payment, which additionally results in a successful double spending.
To summarize, the existence of a miner for which selfish mining is at least as
profitable as honest mining fundamentally undermines the security of payments,
as this attacker bears no cost for continuously attempting to double spending,
and it eventually must succeed. Similarly, an attacker that cannot profit from
selfish mining alone, might be profitable in the long run if it combines it with
double spending, which potentially has grave implications on the profit threshold."

Ok so bytecoin  was pre-mined I get it. What may be missing from this is if they did receive a large profit they may have needed a way to justify it on taxes, so having some traditional entities would make it easier to handle money.

I would say there's a business opportunity here.
yelp has a businesses that accept bitcoin.
I can't find anyone using this, there isn't a drill down in the filters, but you can find reviews mentioning bitcoin
Honestly I use gyft sometimes to make it simple.
What I would recommend is picking up the Groupon card:
You can buy it with Bitcoin then there's tons of local stuff you can use.
Ok this isn't directly spending Bitcoin I get it.

A bit harsh but I'm guessing that's your style.
OPs examples are more on the idealistic, anarchistic side and not grounded so much in terms of Bitcoin as a currency or payment mechanism. 
* It's like cash to FIAT in a bank account. However, cash you can't really send, so Bitcoin has that going for it. Similar to cash you can keep it in your own personal wallet, so unless your wallet is confiscated/stolen (even though hopefully you have encryption) you have ownership.
* It's highly volatile and for the beginner hedging and management of funds can be difficult so as a store of value FIAT is far more stable, in developed countries because there is demand.
* OP_Codes, so semi-programmable money, multi-sig
* low transaction fees

Being a nice guy, doesn't mean he's good for business. There's lots of nice guys and when I have spoken with him on a conversational level he's easy to talk to. However, I have never really gotten a direct answer about a core flaw, or direct ownership of responsibility in my conversations, and personally don't use Bitfinex because I prefer better UI and it always lagged for me. A lot of people swear by it, and that's geat. To each his own.

seconded, they have an easy interface to add most bank accounts more efficiently. If coinbase exchange is available in your area what you can do is deposit directly to your USD account. Then by the time your money has transferred buy on the exchange to skip their upsell. This is also good because you know right when your USD gets in that you'll be getting the right amount in terms of BTC conversion, especially if you plan to spend quickly say just getting discount on purse.
**Warning**: Don't use it to move funds to and from less legitimate "businesses". I recommend Coinbase as a place to buy and store it somewhere else like Bitgo, or wallet although they do offer a "vault" option where you can mange your own keys.

They have some new system where you can log into your bank account directly. It took forever to load for me and I don't know if it's fully functional. There is a back up where you do a small micro-transaction like a few cents and verify it. Might try that instead. I think they're still ironing out the bugs on that new system.

The combination of potentially supplying their Bitcoin code to the DEA, the emails that Mark Karpeles got directly, one somewhat threatening from Carl Mark Force of the DEA, the fact they had/have accounts at Mt. Gox, and Kraken, and they pretty much loathe Bitcoin, and supply hacking tools to a huge amount of agencies. Now does that mean anything, I don't know, but even the mention of, should I release where he is, is ominous. Sure we're looking at loose connections, but has there been anything solid to come out of the investigation to date? Call it what you like, a joke, an aside, coincidence, I don't know. I'll try and put something more in depth together, but there's 1000s of emails on Bitcoin alone.

First kudos on an excellent username.
* no to a computer got in through bitcoin 
* sure it's possible you have a virus, malware whatever but regardless just try to get it working
* you should be able to copy the data from the location where your electrum wallet is stored, and open it on another computer through electrum, just so you don't remove original. Note I mention a separate computer just to ease your worries about malware
* spv clients have been having some issues, delayed block, forks, at least last time i tried, so you might try exporting the private key and loading it in to a full client, or if it's just temporary use maybe blockchain.info wallet.

Allow security researchers to predict the likelihood that a piece of code, company or application will be exploited. Give users a more wide net of warnings beyond just virus definitions, and an extension could actually be built to warn the potential security threat level. Can also allow people to rank likelihood of scam.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:27:46

@_date: 2015-09-22 05:28:19
On a basic level yes, if they enforce that you can only use specific algorithms, and sha256 is not allowed. I am confused by their statement of storage of unencrypted data, because for Bitcoin the private keys are in a sense plain text, but still a piece of an encryption scheme. A bit meta for my taste...

It is wild speculation for sure, but I guess that's part of what makes Bitcoin fun, the fact that there are less rules and exchange owners can just share their opinion.
I respect your point. Definitely this is wild speculation, but people hoping/waiting for the price to go up really has little impact, unless they would be active sellers in the market. A significant price rise, unless we count the possible tampering at Mt. Gox as an unexpected event, will come with reason especially because the previous collapse would make investors second guess themselves. The block halving is a fair speculation point for price, really at this point we don't know what moves the market besides speculation. I see block halving similar to a stock publishing earnings statements, it's the only core event we can expect in Bitcoin itself.

Just going to point this out, but the web of trust extension  (no association just a user) flags all the MMM domains I visited as suspicious. It's useful to avoid scams, malware etc, and also report things you don't like. Especially when heavily browsing and bitcoining.

tl;dr for 12 BTC you might mount the phone file system and look for any hope.
I suppose it's feasible, that if the old wallet config could be swapped out with the current, well you could be in luck. Ideally mycellium didn't over write that, so what you could try is swapping it out with the current, I don't know the exact names, but you can probably figure it out once you're there. The current app uses 12-word seed HD wallet, you should have written down/stored safe these words. According to this post, it's not worth trying to brute force: 
**Android**: 
Basic: 
Advanced: 
**iOS**: This seems a good utility, claims you can view app sandbox data:   otherwise you need to jailbreak without wiping data. dyor
**also from mycelium [faq]( 
"All your keys, addresses and address book entries will be retained when you upgrade your app. The tab previously named «Keys» has been renamed to «Accounts.» Your old bitcoin addresses will become single address accounts, and you can continue to use them as before. We do advise that you switch to new HD accounts, though. You will also see your first empty HD account, which you can start using right away.", "Swipe to the Accounts tab on the left. If you have more than one account, you can select your receiving account by pressing to highlight it."

* bitcoin price decline was not due to this most likely, it was a natural recapitulation of the previous rise, you can't expect to be parabolic. I suspect if we hold here, we'll retest higher highs, remember we've just partially recovered from an epicly long bear trend.
