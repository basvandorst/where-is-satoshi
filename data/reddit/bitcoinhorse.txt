Clarification - Mr Smith just Pumped 1 kWh into the Grid so my Smart Meter Just Told me that he did that and I got billed 8 cent that kWh, 2kms down the Road I am Mining and paid 8 cents for that kWh of Power in accordance with the contract with the Lines company, boom saved 15 cents over Standard Power Rates.

Hi my name is Kurt Hoffmann and I want to Intrigue you.
Using New Zealand as a Case Example hear this out.
Houses that have Solar Panels on their Roofs sell power back to the Grid for 8c Per kWh.
To buy Power from the Local Power Company costs 25c per kWh.
Why not sign a Contract with the Lines Company to Use that 8c worth of kWh that the Solar/Wind Household is pumping into the Grid to Mine your Bitcoins/Ethereum.
So in effect you are buying at the Site for 8c Rather than 25c per kWH for Traditionally Generated Power. This would surely give Incentive to the Small Global Population that Generates Grid Tie Electricity to receive more for their Investment and Environmentally Pro Active Endeavour.
Australia, and the Mid South of the USA are large Solar Producing Countries if a City had 10,000 Renewable Homes that would cater 65% power Savings to any Risk Takers out there who want to Mine on a Factory Scale.
- Pro Tips
Hit up the Solar Forums and Offer Household Owners a Better Power Rate
Sign a Deal with the Lines Company that Services a Region to Buy the power at X rate and Receive the Power on their Grid at given X rate.
Bring down Monopolistic Practices in your Area by starting a Competitive Market
Do your bit to Encourage Renewables and bring down Global Warming.
There are Smart Meters out there that are interfaced with your Home Network to report back power being fed into the grid. (Why not Encrypt the amount of Power being Fed back into the Grid and just bill the Power Companies for what they owe you!)
Enjoy and please talk about this Idea.
