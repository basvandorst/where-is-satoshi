For your last point, I can get all of my money back spent fraudulently with my card's "private key" and be given a new one no problem. This is actually also a plus on the "pull system" you mentioned. Security from my own stupidity or bad luck.

My only fee with PNC is $7/mo when I'm under a certain dollar amount.

Just to note, the current $300 AMD card is the R9 280X (ref: [Gigabyte R9 280X]( which is equivalent to ~5% more power than their old HD 7970 GHz Edition because of it's newer core (XTL or XT3 compared to XT2, ref: [Vendors Update R9 280X]( which can give around ~700 megahashes. Just nitpicking!

If Stephen Hawking raped somebody I still think he'd still be credible in the science world. They're completely irrelevant.

ESEA, a monthly-paid service for CS:GO, has a kernel-level anti-cheat driver and people still manage to get through it. Wallhacks, aimbots, silent aiming, spinbotting, triggerbotting, and some more cheats.

The issue is the difficulty in making it comfy. 99% of the market doesn't want to fiddle with text files and have to reload to see a change. They want a nice GUI where clicking something has instant results.

Intel Insider is a feature, a form of [HDCP]( on their CPUs starting with their Sandy Bridge lineup. I don't quite know what programs really use it but I know any program directly scraping pixel data for screenshots (Windows screenshot function) won't be able to access video pixels that use II without the encryption keys.

The CPU still has to send and recieve data from the NIC to load and show pages. They can just translate the instructions used into actions and data.
Intel already has DRM on their processors that black out screenshots of videos in a certain program.
