In the beginning precious metals were used as a means of value transfer. Because it took time and effort to find , excavate and purify these rare metals .. they held a universal value as everyone saw them as precious. 
And as banks came along , they offered for people to keep their gold in the bank as it was heavy and cumbersome in exchange for a Paper IOU certificate from the bank stating that this person holds 100$ worth of gold in the bank. The Certificate/Receipt is itself worthless without something backing it up other than itself. Now the bank can print as many times the amount of certificates it wants despite how much gold it holds because the bank is accountable only to itself. This is nature of all the Fiat paper money that we use worldwide, each currency is backed by other foreign currencies thus being essentially worthless but since as a society we have agreed to value a piece of paper it creates artificial value.

American Express is digging it's own grave.

Value is correlated with the amount of "Belief" right now because the crypto market is still in its infancy (market is driven by pure speculation). Technology changes and values change accordingly , when there comes a crypto project that does all the things that Bitcoin does plus additional features (most alt coins) and gets the necessary exposure. Tables will turn in no time. Visa/Mastercard/PayPal are not fast or cheap , there's an entire infrastructure built just for the means of payment processing. 
Payment processing is just one aspect of cryptocurrencies, speed and high number of transactions are desirable but that's not why cryptocurrencies have gotten the rep they have . It's the transparency , decentralization (not having to rely on a third person to trust your money with) aspect of crypto which has attracted attention. I think you should revisit the basics of cryptocurrencies to get a better understanding of  what it's advantages are over centralized payment systems.

The devs basically proved everyone investing in B2X that they don't have any say in this , we the devs can change things completely even at the last minute so you better think twice before trusting us with your money. And guess what this fork is still seems likely to happen regardless

So you're saying it's alright for the government to make up false accusations and charge anyone living within the borders of the country ? Going so far as to asking other countries to help squander the personal rights and liberties of a person. If it can happen to one , it can happen to everyone.

Ah the irony of it all ,the  crypto community is slowly transforming into a digital wall street.

From the looks of it , certainly not.

It seems the propaganda is working , everyone dislikes Julian Assange ! 
You fucking idiots , he is the one person in the whole world who has released information and data regarding what is happening behind closed doors in the highest levels of corporations and government, and has never had to retract any statements.
"Wikileaks has a track record of 100% accuracy", this statement alone is unmatched in the field of Journalism. No other organisation/agency in our modern times has been this immensely credible.
He is the reason we even know about the android and apple device backdoors. There are just too many things to mention here which bring to light what our governments are upto. This will be the end of true journalism if Assange doesn't make it through this.
All he's done is told the truth , now if the government doesn't like you telling the truth, you're fucked. Just like he is ! Remember , If it can happen to one of us , then it can happen to all of us. The smallest minority is the individual. Most people dont even know what contributions he's made through WikiLeaks to our collective human society. Everyone now just reads the title, maybe half the article and now they have an opinion on someone they just read a biased article about.

Only the government stresses the narrative that the people are too dumb and need to be "Protected". Its a way of controlling the flow of information and keeping the masses in check. The authorities commit crimes every day but are exempted because they're the authorities , does that make it just? No it does not. 
So it's all right if the government burned their own documents to avoid disclosure of its bloody past where they have funnelled billions of dollars and planned attacks on their own people . But it's a crime if someone helps in exposing this tyranny and crime against humanity.

When something starts to climb , you'll be saying Crypto is alive , bull and bear seasons happen and its very normal to for the market to cycle between the two.

Make an account in coinigy and add your trading account in there..  It'll give you not only your investment portfolio but also graphs to have a visual representation ... Why am I suggesting a ready made platform than your way of noting and updating things...  Is you'll be able to spend more time on analyzing charts than having to worry about updating your profile every time you make a trade...  When you make a lot of trades this method will become unfeasible...  Good Luck ��

Glad you found it useful,  it does take a bit getting used to.

Of course the Chinese wouldnt FUD Bitcoin in any way,  have you taken a look at their giant mining farms (owned by people and companies who also happen to be members of CCP) ...  Denying bitcoin at this point would be like shooting at your own feet...  They like the amount of control they have over bitcoin mining,  that's the whole point

Dont worry about missing the bottom,  just worry about buying when you "know"  its going up...  You'll know its a bottom when there's a tremendous sell off in a short amount of time (even if it bounces back eventually)  that's the window of opportunity where you'll definitely make a profit if you buy..  When you see such a sell off happening put your orders reasonably low,  catching spikes is very rewarding if successful..  If that doesn't happen simply buy(during the sell off)  and wait :)

Nope dont think so,  wait for it to hit a bottom (which could take weeks)
