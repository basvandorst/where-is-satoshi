Anybody else still waiting on payments from Blockstream? I've been shilling SegWit nonstop for the past 2 months and I'm owed for around 200 accounts worth.
Edit: Guys I'm serious they stopped responding to my emails

But don't let any of this pesky """FUD""" get you down. It's time to dump your life savings into bitcoin. Twitter demands it.

Yes, though she used less blunt words. "My child likes to embellish the truth" is a softer way to say that she thinks he's a narcissist and has always been one.

Maybe, if they didn't want to be made fun of, they shouldn't be so hilariously incompetent at trying to perform a power grab on a technology valued at billions of dollars while shirking the opinions of the team of people who have been developing it for years.

This ageism hatred is disgusting and you've fallen victim to the "blame the boomers" meme reddit purports as the answer to all of your problems.

An attack on the Bitcoin network by creating a very large amount of transactions at very low fees in order to push the average fee for "normal" users up. To do this, large amounts of BTC is moved between wallets controlled by the same entity, as you can see with the "fee walls" visualized in the graphs.
It's speculated that it's being done to create a narrative that Bitcoin is broken and doesn't work, especially since it began around the time that Bitcoin Unlimited was being argued about. [Schnorr Signatures]( (to punish spam) and SegWit (for off-chain scaling) are the two main proposals to help counteract this kind of attack, although these are still being argued about for political reasons.
I think you know all of this though, considering you keep spamming the same question and FUDing every time the topic comes up.

It's definitely easier to view the EEA as a corporate-sponsored R&amp;D team, but that's only sorta true. EEA member work goes upstream via EIPs. This gives more capabilities to the Ethereum/ETH core and to people who can't/don't want to run their own chains.
The EEA's usage of the public chain is not a guarantee, although a scenario where private chains are confirmed by a public chain isn't impossible. Either way, Ethereum won't see a platform-level use case outside of tokens and "a store of value" for many years.
