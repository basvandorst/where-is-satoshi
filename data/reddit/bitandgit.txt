Both great companies. I use SurfEasy's USB stick for traveling.

Am I the only one who finds this creepy as much as I find it cool?

B is for better and for bitcoin.

Can't tell if this was intended as humor or not. I hope that it was - that would reflect better on your critical thinking capabilities.

Someone needs to straighten out the BF's marketing team. They are dumb as bricks.

SO much yes!

Looks like the bitcoin part of the audio may have been cut and pasted though. Angry employee possibly? It may be legit, just may not be too.

Can't you just be a quiet capitalist? Vote with your dollar, no need to make a fuss about it and troll this post up.

Not when the 49% has guns and a monopoly on law enforcement.

I have the most confidence in OB, least in ethereum.

The C is not capitalized for goodness sake! Props on the animation though.

Looks like MasterCard didn't like them telling the truth. I screen capped this close to the time of the original post. MasterCard probably called them up and yelled at their support staff. Bullies. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:38:44
Yep, sounds about right. What else is new ;-)

Can we please just have moderate all the things?

Regardless of what political side of the fence you are on, that title is pretty amazing. History is being made all around us.

Idk, I think the government is a little too incompetent to pull that off without some really big loose ends showing. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:58:56
why so serious?

This partnership gives all of those big companies the ability to essentially just "turn on" bitcoin payments in their Adyen preferences. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for many big companies who don't want to deal with the hassle of bitcoin sales going through a different service/accounting system. Jagex is the first Adyen customer to actually "flip on" bitcoin payments. Now all we need to do is wait for all the other companies to catch on. I think this is huge progress. Less people are asking "what is bitcoin?" and more are asking "what's the big deal with bitcoin?". Once people/companies understand that, we will see much bigger moves faster.

I think this is going to be one of the best projects to come out of Bitcoin. These guys are working their butts off too: 
Donate if you can. We need this tech!

Hmmmmmm, what other things has Coinbase prioritized over marketing? 
- Securing a huge round of funding
- Creating Vault
- Toshi
- Opening an Exchange
- Jumping through the legal hoops to open that exchange
Maybe you can take your great marketing ideas and use them with your own company, which I'm assuming you have given your expertise on the subject. Let us know the ROI.

As long as there are nodes running, it can't be taken down.
