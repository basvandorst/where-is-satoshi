I know, I was just being silly really. But I'd tell them to go fuck themselves anyway. They can explain it to a judge. I doubt they'd do that to me though. Pretty sure they will only pick on certain people, ones that dont spend a lot with them.

It *is* possible to spend btc instantly, isn't it? Like in a shop rather than online

Why would a bank care if you pay tax? Hsbc doesn't mind cartel money.
Banks don't like btc. It's obvious why.

Hope they close my account so I don't have to pay my loan back.

The majority? Oh no. Whatever will I do? 
Luckily, it doesn't seem to matter what Joe schmoe thinks. Would be nice though.

Yet the price keeps rising. Every system is attacked. I'm stunned at the price. Thought it'd be 700 for few weeks at least.
Looks like currently the only thing that matters is Asia. China sold al theirs. Luckily their neighbours seem to have bought it all.

The very reason Japan has bought all the bitcoins is cos their currency is devaluing.
One of the reason their currency is devaluing is cos *our* (the west) currencies are devaluing...
I'm thinking buy. I'm thinking the price right now is possibly the biggest sign I've seen. Like, it's obvious isn't it? Or am I missing something?
It can't be banned, and there's only a finite amount? Even if it's not insure by our governments, oh well. I guess they won't be needing a slice :-)
And don't tell me those legit business who are accepting btc right now etc etc

And then pay themselves a bonus of course, with our money.  Then refuse to loan to small business etc.
We could go on, but what's the point, eh ;-)
I actually had an argument with someone who fucked me over with a meeting at HSBC I travelled to.  "No wonder you went bankrupt".
"No we didn't".
"The bailout".
"That wasn't us".
Face -&gt; palm.  Didn't even get onto the cartel money laundering.
This is a true story and that was a business manager I was talking to.  Crossed the road straight into NatWest.
Dunno why I bothered with HSBC.  Had an account with them for a decade, and closed it when they cancelled my cards for no reason when I was on holiday.  Had them write out a cheque when I got back and they asked why.  I fucking lost it with them cos they didn't even have the decency to apogise.
Annnnnd breathe!  lol
This is why I'm pro fraud against banks.

This in a nutshell. It must succeed. 
Banks act like they do you a favour. We're the ones earning those fuckers their money and they act like we owe them something. They actually owe US (British tax payer here).
If you know how to secure your btc, it's more secure than a bank. Banks go bust, as do countries.

Yeah. The only time it's crashed properly in the last 2 years was last xmas when that exchange was compromised I think.  Apart from that minor dips have correlated to minor news, but as time passes value increases.
Literally, what is the biggest threat to btc? I don't know enough about it? I can't see investors all jumping ship to another gravy train. That'd just be a bunch of pyramid schemes. 
Is it the transaction speed that's the biggest issue? If so, that's more of an issue for spending. Itd be a shame, but not the end of the world. 
But what if another coin came along and was more accessable? I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is btc far enough ahead of competition to make it safe from competition?

Why are you saying that like I don't know? That was precisely the point I was making :-/ *you* were the one saying it had something to do with business, I.e. tax I presumed
@_date: 2017-03-12 06:45:36
Sorry, what do you mean by malleability? I googled it but don't follow in the context. This is no way my expertise                            
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:14:05
I think *this* price is the biggest fucking sign there's ever been
