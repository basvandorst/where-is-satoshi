What practical reasons are there that Bitcoin goes down in January? Then recovers.

Serious question. Since when have people started looking at investing in terms of hours? not weeks, months, years? It’s like people have gone insane with no perspective.

How many people are waiting until after Tax season to pull their gains?

If you have a couple million dollars why are you not investing in Bitcoin? You can single handily sink or raise a market. Free money.

Let’s be honest. Anything after 4-5 thousand has been hype. 
There are a lot  of people who invested because they thought like Ponzi people it will go up forever. And there were articles during that hype which said it would go up to 50 or 100,000. 
So now the ceiling is 13,000 to 16,000. And every time it dips the ceiling gets lower. 
This is a really really slow crash that will end at around 1,000$. At that point it can recover some and get real investors, not hype train people.

I have a feeling Bitcoin and MySpace will be synonymous very very soon.

Heard an interview with a guy that said Bitcoin miners are more interested in making money than improving transaction times. And the Technology is first but much better and faster alternatives are on the way, ultimately killing Bitcoin in the long term.

Do you disagree with the statement that there are better faster alternatives out there?

So me being stupid of Crypto taxes did my taxes through Cointracker and saw my cost basis was 300,000. I freaked out and thought I had to pay taxes on that and I’d have to pay 20-30 grand. I soon saw the light with the help of H&amp;R Block.

If Bitcoin goes below 1,000 that’s a real bargain.
