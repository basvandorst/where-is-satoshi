I have been actively trading since early this year, going in I had a lot of losses, I was given capital from family that I have then used to trade(with much better results) this happened over a bunch of exchanges, for a long time I did not keep track of my trades. I have withdrawn a handful of times for rather small sums and added more fiat along the way as well(it's about 90% money in and 10% of that sum has been withdrawn). I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to taxes I just know that I should do everything legit as I'm in this for longevity.

That's my plan, I would just like help in doing this from someone that does it.

The FDIC can protect you a if it's only a few of you that require it. If the bank collapsed and we all needed a bailout per FDIC they do not have the capitol to back it up. It's a similar game the bank plays. Everything is fine till were all screaming for it.

The incentive could be to destroy trust in crypto, could it not? I dont think this will happen just thought it could be a valid incentive for SWIM
