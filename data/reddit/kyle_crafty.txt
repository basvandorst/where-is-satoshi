Are you worried about bitcoin price decline affecting your profits in an unwanted way?

Still hard to buy things when the value drops though.

Ah that makes sense! Thanks :)

Very informative. Thank you :)

It's still worth more than yesterday.

That was perfect.

I purchased 0.04 at a point where they were worth $650. When you say normal would it be the "normal" as seen in [this picture]( or the "return to mean" value? Just curious. Not looking for a quick buck but I only recently realized how anxiety educing this is and would like to know where I can guesstimate when I can break even. Albiet I can afford to lose it, I'd still rather not.

Not to mention it's dropped 300 dollars in an hour.

On my birthday a few years back a girl named Daniel Loftus (I believe) had a jetski collision and is only now starting to show signs of recovery. It's been over 3 years.

How much of an impact does such a transaction have?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:31:18
Respectable disclaimer. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:37:14
Seriously. I only had 27 bucks to spare and put myself down for less than 0.05 =\
