 We've achieved voluntary trade so we're done? 
What about the laws that shift wealth one way or the other? Are those allowed in your reality? Or should trade not be governed.

In society people have a say on what is right or wrong. 
Ultimately, it doesn't matter, no. But the context they're discussing isn't ultimate reality, it's society. Where opinions are a necessity. 
It could be argued if people were closer to the truth, it wouldn't matter. In the meantime, don't you think it's wise to shape society away from greed and fear? 
Or is discussion just off limits.

Everything we invest in is based on speculation.  I just bought a house.  It’s supposed to be one of the safest bets, but if the economy tanks, or if a big government change destroys this place, if our local industries slow down, the house is worth less.  Even a savings account interest is betting against inflation. 
 So what do ya do?

Even if it doesn’t go to zero, if it’s worth a quarter as much that’s a significant loss on investment.
I’m living in a rural area, btw, so there is the chance of it becoming a ghost town.  And it’s  waterfront property so the climate will have a say over the decades.  But that’s besides the point.
If you can’t see some people don’t mind more risk for a higher reward, then there’s really no sense saying anything.   You’re clearly not the type to invest in volatile or unproven stocks. That cool, but other people are more willing.  Some strike it big, some don’t. 
That’s it.

Oh shit, that's interesting.  Thanks for the thought

I guess that's the issue, I'm not sure most  people want change.   Get a couple trusted anchors to speak about how the coin is going to cause the next apocalypse and you've got an army that will kill to keep things the same.   I'm jaded.

How would selling the coins be risky?

Why not buy the bitcoin on coin base?
I'm Canadian and was gonna buy $1000 with my credit card, since even with the 4% fee it was well below the cost of Canadianbitcoins.com

I was on the train (and still am going to invest $1000), thinking it would become mainstream, but last night I realized the government and banks would never be on board without tracking.  I'm less optimistic now, but still going to gamble.
