His original claim was that he paid 40% to the "corrupt" US Government. He does not.

The problem with that logic is that your assumption of fairness is that "he makes more, so he should give less in percentage because he gives more in total".
You seem to not consider that by making more, he also gets to keep a lot more. 
We have a progressive tax system because someone working for $12/hour for 2080 hours a year only makes $24960. After rent, bills, and food, what does that leave a person?
A person making $50/hour makes $104,000, and pay a progressively higher share because not only can they afford to take care of necessities, they can also afford luxury goods and spend money on things they don't need. Even with a higher tax (or hell, even a $0 tax for person making 25K), it's still fair. The person making $25K spends all of their money into the economy. They have no choice. You start taxing them, and they have to chose between food and rent. Food over rent? Lose your home. Lose your job. Now they are on the social net, or even worse off. 
No thanks, I'd rather pay "more", while having more, living comfortably, and not have those less well off come after me for having more.
Edit: because this comes up every time in these conversations. If the guy making 25K is not paying any tax at all on his 25K, neither am I! Our progressive system has tiers, it's not on your total income. We all pay the same tax on the same amount of money, but if you make even more, the next bracket is taxed at a higher rate, and then the bracket after that goes up a bit as well. This is why, even when someone is in the highest tax bracket, their effective tax rate is lower.

Ah yes, the "free market does it better" argument. 
Because the free market is out for public interest, and not profits. 
Get fucked. I'm done. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:28
You're full of shit. I'm in the top 6/7% range, and the taxes we pay are nowhere near what you claim. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:34
IIRC, that's just about the taxable income I had last year. Of course it doesn't include things like write offs, retirement, etc, but yes, roughly 130K. 
And yes, we can add in all possible taxes, but the original post talked about the Federal government, and only after being called out did he start rolling in property, sales, tobacco, alcohol, gas, state, etc etc taxes to make his 40% point. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:14:00
Which isn't what you said in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:42


FEDERAL, and LOCAL and STATE, and SPECIFIC taxes are not the same, in the context of your sentence. 
Dear fucking god, can you just not admit that you said a bullshit statement, and move on? YOU.DO.NOT.PAY.40% to the feds.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:11:51
Sure. We'll just raise sales tax to 40%. 
How do you think we'll pay for anything? Defense? Safety nets? Roads? 
You think you'll have a good life if there are no roads, and you can't travel faster than 10MPH on your bicycle or horse to get to work? How's that going to work out for your income potential?
Taxes are opportunity cost. 
I could pay less taxes in my home country. And I could make a fraction of what I earn now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:55
IL, just shy of 5%. 
Has zero fuck all to do with his assumption of 40% FEDERAL tax: 


@_date: 2017-12-08 16:14:14
Yes, that's how percentages work. The bigger the pot, the more numbers are pulled by the same percentage. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:00:42
Account doesn't check out - 2 days old. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:57
Look at his post: 


He was claiming to pay 40% to the feds. He does not. You do not. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:47:09
He wasn't originally. Why is that so hard to understand? State gov and local gov has little to do with the US Gov in the context he used.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:16
And I don't think anyone disagrees that some people pay that much. Here was his statement: 


He was claiming to pay that much to the feds. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:34:08
Nah, you'd just redefine the discussion, and make it appear to be what you meant. It's cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:40:19
Honestly seems backward, but the rich make the rules.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:40
Wut? IL Income Tax is 4.95%. The fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:18:36
If he actually made that much (he said he doesn't), and he actually paid that much, then the first line advice makes sense: get a better CPA. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:49:34
Sure, and if we count my retirement savings, rainy day savings, food budget, and living expenses, I'm out 90% of my money!
We originally talked Federal, Medicare/aid, SSI and state income tax. At the 6/7% mark, I'm at about 24/25% if I remember last years numbers accurately. That's a far shot from 40%
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:03:52
You pay close to 33% in state income tax as you do in federal? WTF are you on about?
Also, if I include my utilities, my food, savings, and entertainment budget, I'm taxed at over 90%!!!!!!!111!!!!!WTF!!!!11!!
Are you fucking serious? Everyone pays sales tax. Property tax is something you can control. So is fucking state tax if you really hate it. Alcohol taxes? Luxury taxes? Are you fucking kidding me? 
You start a conversation about Federal government, and now try to weasel out by counting every fucking tax, fee, and toll you might have to pay during the year? 


I'm taxed more than 40% of my income to pay for the massive corruption.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:12:00
Not much I can advise on that front. Taxation is a thing. No way to avoid it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:05:17
And at 6/7%, It was 24/25%. The difference between you and me, and you and 1%, and then someone at 9/10% is almost insane. 
So I ran the numbers, supposedly based on 2016 household income data:








@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:33
Are we just going to ignore the first sentence?


@_date: 2017-12-08 19:22:59
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:44:29
Absolutely. Just not to the feds.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:49:21
Are you mentally challenged? Without roads, that target doesn't fucking get built. Restocking the shelves? Forget about it. 
Roads is a simplistic look at taxes, but hey, roads, since the time of Rome have driven civilization. Without roads you're just a potato farmer in area A, and I'm a carrot farmer in area B, without a chance to ever communicate.

Gates foundation is an epic fail? Are you fucking delusional or stupid?
