It's as if we should be able to downvote posts that are stupid instead of wasting your own time commenting on them!
Reddit sucks

If Bitcoin is going to become a currency, it needs to support $3 hamburgers too.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:00:21
Sure you can! Nothing is preventing laws from being passed that ban Bitcoin except human will. 
It was a common meme that you can't stop the internet, that it treats censorship like damage and routes around it. Except that, for all intents and purposes, China has already done exactly that with their great firewall of China. I'll be fair, it's not a perfect solution and nothing ever is, but it is rather effective, especially when combined with the power of the state.
Laws that ban activity, such as drug abuse and prostitution, do not completely stop the activity that they work against. But they do reduce and alter that activity significantly.

Is there evidence that this is happening to any significant degree?

When it was trading at $6250 I told an associate that now is an excellent time to buy and that it would probably hit $10k within about month or two. Man, I am KICKING myself for not taking my own advice...
On a good note, I figure it's probably time to buy in another 2 weeks.

Really? What part of credit cards suck? What other form of currency can you carry in your wallet, thousands of dollars worth, and still have access to it even when you lose your wallet? What form of currency translate instantly, just about anywhere in the world?
Simply by using my credit card, I have earned an international trip abroad, with virtually no fees. 
There are real problems with fiat currency, but let's not pretend that something is what it isn't!
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:36:24
Oh bother. FDIC and stuff. This is stupid propaganda.
If my credit card number get stolen, I am reimbursed. It has happened to me more than once. If I lose my Bitcoin, I am simply screwed, there is no recourse, except to never make that mistake. 
Look guys, Bitcoin is cool and all, but let's not pretend that there are issues with fiat currency that really don't exist okay?
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:28:12


... Which is better than being screwed, period. As I stated, it's happened to me twice and was easily resolved at no cost to me. 


This is kind of irrelevant. OP mentioned money on "deposit", not investments. 


As a business owner, this is not atypical.

Odd that I'm seeing this message only now... 


Sorta. Not really. At least, not with gold. It's supply has been very steady. 


But, as it's currently used bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, infinitely divisible. So there is no real limitation to the "amount" of bitcoin. 
Further, since the velocity of financial transfers is effectively immediate, there's nothing tying value to bitcoin. A single penny could conceivably sustain the US economy if its velocity is high enough. 


Don't forget blowing coke. 


This is far from certain. For example, Monero has far better privacy built in fundamentally. Ethereum has contracts and even embedded software in the blockchain. Depending on market needs, these could easily be "deal killers" for Bitcoin. 
Further, Bitcoins are not superior in all ways. They are natively slow for transfers. There are over a million owned by Satoshi. You can't recover stolen bitcoins. They are sensitive to &gt; 50% attacks. and so on.

Sorry, but you're wrong. We're not talking about a parabola, but an exponent. And the reality of any exponential function is that it does not matter when you examine it, it has the same, fractal property of starting with what appears to be a flat line, and then sharply rising towards the right end. 
The only thing that changes is the scale of the graph. See for yourself: put a 1 in cell a1, then make the cell below it twice it's previous (=a1*2) Copy the 2nd cell down 10 cells in Excel. Make a line graph. See how the slope changes? Now, copy another 10 and make a graph. Looks about the same, doesn't it? 
In economies, [exponential growth is so consistent that it can actually be used to identify bullshit information.]( 
Since bitcoin is perfectly fungible and not based on any real world limitation other than the number of unmined coins, its maximum value could be written as something like: 


At some point, it becomes feasible to brute force private keys but I think we're still at least a few orders of magnitude away from that. 
EDIT: Oops, wrong math formula. I've corrected my exercise to demonstrate [exponential growth](

Gold isn't currency because there isn't enough of it. It couldn't grow to encompass the world's economy. 


There. Fixed that for you.

So you aren't a people?
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:51:51


Ha ha ha!


Sure it does! Try running an economy with 5 $1 bills sometime. 


This statement is completely unsupported. Commodities like gold have been tried for centuries as currency, and are prone to boom/bust cycles, hoarding, and deflationary spirals. Well managed fiat currencies can avoid many of these pitfalls.


The idea of storing wealth in money is itself a problem. Money is useful for *moving* wealth around, but if too much wealth is stored in money, it becomes a commodity rather than a currency. Having too much wealth "stored" in money causes the economy to slow down and contributes to economic recessions. 


I like to store my wealth in assets that return on investment. Historically, commodities that are fixed in supply, like gold and silver, are terrible investments.

Part of the problem of understanding currency, money, and related terms is that they are used differently by different people. 


If you could suggest what I might be lacking an understanding in, that would be highly appreciated. Otherwise, this statement lacks value and I am forced to ignore it. 


Without the understanding that you imply, this statement seems absurd. Any commodity can be in a bubble and be over valued based on speculation. Bitcoins themselves lack any value whatsoever, they are literally just numbers that happen to be hard to figure out. Like the fiat currency so often criticized here, their *only* value is that which we ascribe to them, and that value can be raised temporarily through speculation. 
But I won't do the same to you. To understand the concerns about people saving value too much in money vs other assets, you need only understand the implications of [monetary velocity]( 
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:49:43


Yep. 


I think you missed the word "only" in my question. Yes, it's true that increasing supply will generally lower the price of the commodity in question. But it's equally obvious (to me) that it's not the only factor. 


Wait, you really think that *increased supply* is the only factor that caused the housing bubble to collapse? 


No, it doesn't address the boom/bust cycle of the price of gold at all.

Hey, thanks for pointing out that, in fact, my math formula was wrong. 
I'll stand behind the rest of my *ahem* long-winded drivel. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:17:56
Wait, are you of the mindset that the only reason a bubble "pops" is because of increased supply? That demand can't temporarily raise the price for a commodity beyond sustainability?
Is that all you got?!
Even in the example given of gold, there is a clear boom/bust cycles of the historic price of gold, despite it never having a significant increase in supply.
