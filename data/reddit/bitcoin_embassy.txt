Confirming this, the very same happened to a business nearby. Once we helped them change the configuration in Bitpay, the transaction was confirmed almost immediately.

Let's keep it civil while we agree on "Beer" becoming another Bitcoin unit name :)

We'll drop them a line and try to find out.

This is not exactly fresh news - Bitcoin donations are accepted since March this year - but we wanted to share it as a reminder of an important project to support.
When discussing how to increase the security of your Bitcoin installation and general, GNU/Linux (and in general aiming at using 100% free software) is often cited as an important way to achieve and maintain better practices.
Trisquel is a derivative of Ubuntu, based on the 12.04 LTS version, while removing the non-free software components in Ubuntu.

Confirmed. If you're looking for a good excuse to come to Montreal, we're happy to provide it :)
Keep an eye on our [website]( for the next events, we also use [EventBrite](

Of course, but where's the fun in that? And we love Reddit's use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:22:03
Using bitcoinaverage.com API (including its options to ignore Mt Gox) would also seem logical .
Proper support for l10n is also important. We could help with French and Spanish.
We are planning a workshop about Bitcoin integration in WordPress, let us know if/when this happens.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:29:37
Every single friendly, objective and constructive suggestion counts. If you use other free open source projects, consider writing them a short note, filing a bug report about this or participating in existing discussions about accepting Bitcoin for donations.

I smell opportunity. Setup a local exchange, on that table :)

It's not enough to be "open source". You also need to be using a free software license approved by the [Open source inititaive](
This guarantees essential freedoms, including freedom to share, modify, examine the source code and use the results without any restrictions.
