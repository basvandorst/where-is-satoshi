This is where credit cards actually have an advantage over bitcoin. With a credit card you can file a dispute. The dispute will get lost in Microsoft's bureaucratic wasteland and they won't try to fight it. Iv had to do it before with them.

I like the idea of an immutable main chain and side chains for transactions that need to be quick, like buying coffee
@_date: 2016-08-20 05:18:13
Would also buy

Its actually pretty easy to just memorize a 12 word seed. Run over it in your head every now and then and make sure you can recover periodically.

There is actually a way to prove you destroyed a coin. But yea most lost coins can't be proven to be lost.

If the software or computer you're using to sweep the paper wallet is insecure the BIP password for the other wallets could be compromised. But that alone is not enough for a hacker to sweep them.

 doesn't use entirely qr codes but for generating addresses and transferring public keys

Did they fix the bug where the prices were NaN on Mac?
@_date: 2016-11-06 22:28:30
I'm glad I could help
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:31:30
Is anyone sick of winning yet?
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:05:06
yup sell now before it goes to zero

Make Bitcoin great again!

I'm waiting for bitcore to upgrade since my node runs on it.
Edit:

That’s not mathematically possible without your private keys. The transaction can not be tampered with once it’s signed. They could try to block the transaction entirely but then people would start using tor or VPNs.

Bitcoin is doing exactly what its supposed to, it's resisting change. This is the main property that gives it value. If you need to use a coin that has centralized decision making and is easier to change we have altcoins for that. The fact that this debate has gone on for so long with nothing to show actually increases my confidence in Bitcoin.
Reddit's algorithm incentivizes hysteria which is convincing people the sky is falling. In reality the "problems" you are hearing about are actually strengths
@_date: 2016-09-01 15:05:57
That saying we have about private keys applies equally well to gold.

you can download it on any podcast player

Wouldn't you want to use Bitcoin at those times since all the buy orders would cause a spike in the price, increasing bitcoin's purchasing power.

Their options for deposits are awesome, you can deposit to a list of addresses or just give them your bip32 xpub. That's why I switched from coinbase autobuy. The UX on the site could use some help though
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:12:57
I prefer 1000 bits
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:15:35
Would not recommend copay, multiple people have experienced a bug where the transaction gets duplicated and sends the coins twice. Luckily for me the person I sent to twice was nice enough to send it back. The devs refused to look into it.
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:11:31
Thanks! here's my node if you're interested

I'm using Intel NUC NUC5CPYH. After you add ram and hard drive it will be around $200 but it blows raspberry pi out of the water in performance and you can also use it as a 4K media box.

Im using ubuntu server 14.04. If you have the same model I don't recommend using 16.04 or anything based off it as there are known issues. I had to learn the hard way.  
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:42:07
Everybody knows 10k is moon
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:37:55
Ill definitely do that going forward. Didn't think it would be necessary since I'm the only dev but it would be nice to keep the master clean for situations like this
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:08:35
Thanks, its been a good learning experience. Next im gonna try auto depositing with bitwage since they let you setup a list of addresses to send to. Im in the process of switching from coinbase.

Trezor has the save caveats as any software. When you use it you are trusting a third party to not steal your money. If they were hacked or decided to be malicious they could add code to the update that drains your funds. Stuff like that happens all the time. Anybody who thinks it's impossible is kidding themselves.
@_date: 2016-07-05 23:53:31
Lots of BIPs are non protocol related
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:53:03
I made something that might be just what your talking about. Using it as cold storage on a raspberry pi.  If you clone it you might want to go back a commit since I'm in the middle of adding support for multiple BIP44 accounts
@_date: 2013-06-03 21:25:20
Just wondering but did you mean to say USD/BTC since increasing BTC/USD would mean decreasing value of bitcoins
