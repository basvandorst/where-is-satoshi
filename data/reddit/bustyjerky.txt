Moving the transaction over to the computer that's offline for signing, you'd use a USB device or something? You're connecting something that was connected to an online computer into an offline one, unless I'm missing something?

Did they go to an invalid wallet or to an actual real used wallet?

When you want to spend some Bitcoins from the cold storage, you have to reconstruct the entire key and put it into an Internet enabled computer right? At that point, even to spend a small amount of BTC, you'd have to transfer all your coins away to another cold storage wallet as well as the transfer you want to make, since that private key is now compromised?
As soon as you connect it to a computer, it becomes vulnerable right?

I'm not sure what the major exchanges are wondering. That was my first query.
Bitstamp is using a local Slovanian bank it seems. I'm guessing the other big ones are using LHV Bank in Estonia, since that seems to be pretty accepting of cryptocurrency. I'm not aware of any banks being used in Western or more "traditional" countries, like the US or UK.

Yeah, so you think Richmond and Surrey are expensive places to live?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:09:49
It's not *that* expensive lol.
You can also live in the areas real close to it which are cheap as fuck.

Common sense is your argument for claiming any kind of online monetary tipping requires the operator to do KYC... Fuck this sub has went downhill.
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:59:55
Why is reddit not doing KYC then? Or heck, any kind of service that has gifting/tipping support.
Do you have a source for this legal opinion?

The only people that give Twitter money are advertisers. Twitter does not sell anything to consumers directly. Twitter accepting Bitcoin for advertisements would barely affect the Bitcoin price.
Valve accepting Bitcoin for Steam games was far more noteworthy, and even that barely had an impact on price.

You can't even tip people with normal currency right now. There isn't a Twitter gold or something. And I doubt Twitter would be interested in adding such a feature, it would not be suitable on Twitter imo. It kinda goes against what the platform is.


AML/KYC would probably not apply here. Not everything crypto requires AML/KYC. Most laws (in most jurisdictions, few exceptions like some US states) relating to AML/KYC don't even force the regulation of crypto as well. Crypto companies generally do it optionally, meeting general laws for financial activities (1) to be prepared when lawmakers do properly regulate crypto; (2) to actually prevent money laundering and fraud activities on their platform. Most exchanges are *not* legally obligated to be doing KYC. They opt into being regulated. Certain activities do have required regulation, like holding fiat customer funds. That's true of the last time I talked to a lawyer about this.
And most companies doing KYC/AML do it because they are financial exchanges or "e-money transmitters". This would be more comparable to reddit gold - you don't see reddit doing KYC.

Few problems here. This sub probably won’t like it since half the people like to live in an alternate reality and accepting problems will devalue their investment but:
1.	All the aforementioned startups provide a useful value to society. We actively use Uber and Airbnb. Bitcoin has no productive uses currently. Most merchants don’t accept it, volatility makes it impractical, transactions can’t be confirmed quickly, only investors find value in it.
2.	Bitcoin lost all that value, which many seem to forget
3.	The aforementioned startups kept their gains they made. Bitcoin didn’t.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:42:29
They kept their stock market gains. Bitcoin didn’t. Their revenues and profits are immaterial. You can’t “invest” in the profit of a company, hence that is clearly not the metric being compared here. You invest in stocks, and in that sense they remain profitable.
On the second part, you’re correct. But people will be willing to keep it afloat for quite a while now. They have quite a lot of opportunity to turn a profit. But at least that’s a real challenge with real value to people in the meantime. Cryptocurrency is just a form of wealth redistribution.
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:22:48
It might never be profitable, it doesn’t matter. Spotify is the same. They provide value to our society, to hundreds of millions of people across the globe daily, hourly even.

These groups don't want to kill Bitcoin...
That's absolute nonsense. Banks themselves have invested in it for private investors (whilst publicly maintaining an aggressive policy). If governments wanted to kill Bitcoin, they would've already.
These groups are generally supportive towards cryptocurrencies, especially governments.

I always wonder what Satoshi would think of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies today and if they're living true to his vision and goals.
The big daddy of them all and nobody even knows who the guy is.

It sucks that immediately after on r/coinbase everyone kept blaming Coinbase even after their statement that Visa did it. After Visa preliminary denied it, people race to say Coinbase was bullshitting.
Coinbase may have shit support and be hard as fuck to work with, but they don't have a reputation of scamming, and they've generally been OK transparent.
I think it was a bit poor of the community to immediately race to keep blaming Coinbase.
Glad it's sorted now, though.

Cryptocurrencies, more than any other asset, are associated with current news. Most the people here (and more-so in have some vested interest in cryptos.
When price dies, they get a bit worried really. They get caught up in HODL and circlejerk optimism in attempts to cause the price to increase, again.
Bad news doesn't really end up circulating as much because of its effect on the price. If it does inevitably circulate, people try to cook up something positive with it.
Cryptocurrency communities in general end up being pretty shit for this reason. People have too much vested interest to engage in more honest discussions. Bitcoin in early days before all the price hype and the traders had a great community. Some altcoins had great communities before popularity hit and traders took over the active discussion.
To some extent, a no-trade-discussion subreddit would be useful, and all trade shit and memes are posted to another sub. Nano achieved this with success, separating trading discussion and focused discussion.

He's answered most questions.
He's not going to go against the advice of his lawyers just to satisfy some fucking redditors.
Publicity stunt... He can legally get away with billions out of this.

I am breathlessly hoping bitcoin can survive this stealthy accumulation attack.
Do you even know what you're talking about? Do you realise what you're saying?
People like this would *LITERALLY* be incurring *MAJOR* financial losses to do some bullshit like that. They'd be losing at best massive potential market income and at worst losing out massively on their investment and the difference between that and the market price.
They have a **FAR** greater interest in retaining the integrity of their funds than you do. And even if they did decide to dump the coins for a low cost, it's not the end of the world, some guy just wasted tends/hundreds of millions (or more), while the rest of the network faces some period of uncertainty but probably recovers with more coins in circulation.
