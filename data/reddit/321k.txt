I would also love an invite!

Based on that graph you really can't say one way or the other, but I think it's an interesting proposition. If we would assume that there is a causal relationship, one could build a trading strategy based on things like the number of tweets or the amount of Google searches. A granger-causality test would add some weight to that idea.

And if the relationship holds true, today's Google Trends data is a pretty strong sell signal 
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:12:00
Are you saying that an improvement in those factors lead to an increase in the price?

I downloaded Bitcoin price data for 1.4.2012-31.3.2013 and assembled daily Google searches for Bitcoin for the same time period. This is the scatterplot of the two. 90% of the variation in the Bitcoin price is explained by search volume on Google Trends, which is pretty impressive.
Research on the correlation between Google Trends data and stock prices have found correlations between volatility and searches. But to see this direct relationship between actual prices and searches is pretty stunning.
Does this mean that an increase in searches indicates a price increase? It might of course very well be the other way around, that increasing Bitcoin prices lead to more attention.

I'd love to see a list of those fundamentals.

It would be interesting to see what the correlation between number of tweets and price is as well. I haven't found any service offering time series data for Twitter keywords though.

The causation is probably the other way around. The increasing prices for Bitcoins are driving interest.

How much of the current appreciation is speculative, and how much is because of people using bitcoins to do business? I haven't seen any data on the size of the bitcoin economy (not just the nominal value of the currency) so it's hard to know. All I can say is that the price chart suggest speculative buying. The very fact that its value is so volatile makes it kind of hard to use for paying bills. Just today the value has increased almost 10%.

On the other hand, the price of all financial assets fluctuate. If we assume that the market for Bitcoins is somewhat efficient, the price should follow a random walk. Thinking that the price of any asset subjected to randomness will just go up and never down is rather optimistic.

As a European, I would not recommend a monetary union where there isn't already a political union. And the concept of a global currency implies a mandatory use of said currency. Otherwise the system is no different from what we have today.

I'm not convinced that adoption is driving the price. The past year the price has gone up 2800%. I find it hard to believe that all that is due to any of the factors you list. In fact, such a volatile price reduces it's usefulness as a store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. 
When the price goes down, it's not going to be because it has stopped having useful properties. Rather is will be a speculative bubble coming to an end.

That's an interesting thought. I haven't seen any data on it, but it would make for a pretty strong trading strategy. The search volume is going down, but the price is still increasing very rapidly. It will be interesting to see if this means that the market will cool down now.
