What said. 
If you live in Germany for more than 6 consecutive months, you pay all of your tax there, and since you can't be double-taxed, you can safely sell your bitcoins.
Here's the list of countries that have a no-double-taxing agreement with Germany: 
If you have enough bitcoins for it to become worthwhile, I advise you to see a professional to confirm all of this and not spend half a year in Germany on the word of an internet stranger.

Bitcoin exchanges can't have UK accounts (e. g. Bitstamp has its HQ in London but bank in Slovenia), so there can't be instant transfer of money to the exchange. But that can happen with local bitcoins.

Can you expand? What do you mean "via simply constructed channel that must traverse a hub"? How do you see the attack working?
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:46:51
Well, let's say you have bitcoin in 1000 addresses that you want to consolidate into 1 address.
You have 2 options:
- 1 huge transaction, with 1000 inputs and 1 output
- 1000 small transactions, with 1 input and 1 output each
Both are essentially the same transaction, but the first one is slightly more efficient (and a lot more should Schnorr signatures be implemented). If in a block there are 1000 other, non-segwit transactions, then:
- With the one huge transaction, the percentage of segwit transactions in the block is 0.1%
- With the 1000 less efficient ones, the percentage of segwit transactions in the block is 50%
Intuitively, the second option shows a lot more "adoption", since 50% of transactions are segwit! But in reality, the first option is obviously better for the network (and the one doing the transactions).
That's why the percentage of the number of transactions is not really a suitable metric. But the percentage of witness data in the block is similar in both cases, making it a more suitable metric.

Have you experienced any scammers? I hear some horror stories about LocalBitcoins, and the risks seem to be the same here.
For example someone could decide to fulfill the wire transfer only if the price increases after he made the buy order, or they decide to claw back the sepa withdrawal claiming fraud...
How is trust managed on bisq?
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:06:43
No, not if the withdrawal is made from a consolidated address.
The best approach for exchanges is still to consolidate when fees are down and process withdrawals from those consolidated addresses, but the difference between that &amp; processing withdrawals by withdrawing from unconsolidated addresses (and consolidating them at the same time) is not so huge anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:42:43
You can easily see when you're moving btc, just check your address on an explorer and you see the transaction. Bitstamp and Poloniex both do transaction batching.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:16:46
Segwit makes signature data in segwit cheaper (1/4th the cost), by allowing blocks to contains more bytes of signature data. Theorically, if a transaction was made up of only signature data it could be 4MB. By allowing more signature bytes, it sort of reduces the space the signature data takes (sort of...). Segwit has a lot of other advantages, enabling Lightning for example.
Schnorr signatures reduce the size of signature data, which can be huge when consolidating received bitcoins from multiple addresses into one. This time it's a real reduction in size, and it also makes consolidating transactions a lot cheaper.

My prediction at the beginning of the year was that the current situation would remain for a while, between 6 months &amp; 1 year and a half while growing pains are sorted out, and it would take off after that.

Spend 6 month &amp; 1 day in germany, sell your bitcoins (that you got at least a year before), 0 tax!
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:15:54
Well they have like 50k or even 100k signups / day.
I understand your feeling though. There was a problem with my verification process and I had an answer like a month and a half later. All good now however.

In Germany it's currency if you hold it for more than a year before converting it back to €, no taxes.
In France it's like stocks, if you have more € at the end of the year you pay taxes, so you can convert back to crypto before year ends to avoid paying those taxes.
I don't know about other countries, what countries are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:45:56
There's other improvements in the works that could help increase the number of transactions like schnorr signatures.
You could always increase block size now as a stopgap measure, but then when there's another congestion, will you say "let's just increase the blocksize again" indefinitely? That will kill any motivation big actors like coinbase have to implement the protocol changes like schnorr signature and segwit, and we'd end up with an inefficient network.
Segwit is only at 10% usage now, blame major entities that don't implement it for the congestion instead of the core devs.

To add to that, the mempool can be seen [here]( and 20+ sat/byte transactions are consistently mined (corresponding to less than 20 cents even for non segwit transactions).

This is really great technology, but I hope it adapts to bitcoin and not the other way around - I don't want protocol changes or block size increases blocked because of this technology.

Will being able to download the UTXO commitment set end that debate once for all? Or will the core client still need to download the whole blockchain before being functional?
I don't understand Luke's position. As I understand from the blockstream satellite press release, being able to download the UTXO set and having it confirmed in blocks by miners is a plan for the future. Even if it takes a few years (2, 3?) to come to fruition, the network can tolerate a node taking longer to fully sync up in the meanwhile. It doesn't justify reducing block size, a big change, for something that will get fixed in the short to mid term.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:49:56
The 8kB/s translate to 4.8 MB for 10 minutes. Considering blocks are capped to 4MB (including unsigned data) and likely to reach that with segwit transaction, a future block size increase (eg 2x) would make the system not functional.


There should be more concrete plans, even without a block size increase the maximum capacity of the system is dangerously close to Bitcoin's max block size (again, including header data such as segwit's signatures).

The thing is that bitcoin merchants need to give each client a different address to know who's paid. They can't use the same receiving address for everyone. So $1000 of profits split into 20 different addresses and you get huge fees when grouping them to send them to cold storage, regardless of the wallet used.

I did send a small amount to my segwit address and then sent it through to another segwit address to confirm it was working properly and I could withdraw funds from exchanges in the future to that address directly.
(Using bitcoin-qt, "addwitnessaddress &lt;non-segwit address&gt;" in the commandline window to generate segwit addresses)

Because they \*listen\* on an open port. It's the technical term. They listen for incoming connections.
All nodes are two-way nodes, but there can't be a connection between two non-listening nodes. Starting from a certain ratio of listening nodes / non-listening nodes, the non-listening nodes are becoming a burden on the listening nodes (we see something like 8 outgoing connections and 104 incoming connections).
It'd be great if a p2p protocol (like torrent, skype, webrtc etc) was used, where a brief intervention by a third party would make the connection between two non-listening nodes possible, it'd make the network a lot more homogeneous.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:47:24
I'm not sure of the fact that Facebook Coin cannot be open. It can basically be a different USDT. Tether issues and redeems USDT, but anyone can transact it. In a similar manner, Facebook could be a bank that issues and redeems tokens, but with free flow of tokens between users.
I at least hope that their project has some real technological achievements (scaling, speed...) to justify a separate network when they could just use an existing network like Ethereum with ERC-20 tokens.

The funding is nice, but what can be the business model justifying that investment? There are no ads, there is no premium features and they make a point of privacy so they won't sell data.
There is also this found on their website:


The only product that can deliver some returns is the upcoming DOJO, but I don't see that supporting a company. I really like the ideas of wallets like Samourai and Wasabi, but I can't trust them with my bitcoin without knowing about their business model and where they expect to earn money.

Well first GDAX (same company) is less expensive.
Second, withdrawal fee is usually 1mBTC (= 4.5$) except polo for which it's 0.1 mBTC, or Gemini for which it's free ([and GDAX too?]( It's not a percentage cost.
@_date: 2016-10-10 09:17:12
Doesn't segwit already remove signatures from the 1MB limit? Wouldn't that make the gain on signature size from schnorr signatures irrelevant?
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:33:55
You can either keep it all and sell all the bitcoin cash for bitcoin after the fork. Or you can put it on an excahnge (like Poloniex) and lend it at 3% or more. If the loan is taken the corresponding btc won't be split into bitcoin cash but it's still a nice interest rate.
Bitcoin cash is [around 350$]( in the future market, so you'll increase your BTC by more than 10%. Much better and safer than taking such a risk.

Coins aren't subject to VAT. The tax is on capital gains only. 
If you buy 500$ of coins and sell them for 1000$ later, you will pay 30% of (1000-500)$, so 150$, and keep 850$ for yourself.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:32:07
The only advice I can give is cost-averaging, buying a small amount each day or each week. I do believe the price is going to shoot up after segwit truly activates (two weeks from now), but that's only speculation. Maybe you should buy small amounts now and increase your stake significantly if the price goes down.
You don't want to be [that guy]( Moreover if you buy before Aug 1 and get your coins split into bitcoin cash, it is equivalent to buying under 2500$.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:50:13
All prices in Europe are displayed VAT-included. If you buy a new PC, its price is going to be displayed 1200€. Not a 1000€ price tag and 200€ more at checkout. Nobody thinks as VAT as an extra in the price, it's just part of the product.
Even if you insist on counting VAT as a tax, it has nothing to do with bitcoin. You would pay it either way, it's not an extra tax on crypto.
And the tax is 30% of profits. Not 60%. If you only have crypto profits, then yea, you'd need to cash out 1714€ to buy a 1200€ computer (which you insist is really 1000€, but w/e).

Because what bitcoin needs is practical uses like running a full node on a smartphone, or chain pruning so you don't have to use 300GB of hard drive. At the moment this is just a fancy gadget and resources could be better spent elsewhere.

It seems that it can be run in pruned mode (5GB instead of 256GB of storage needed) and that's great. Although it seems it can't import wallets in that mode, and there are probably caveats like battery usage. Anyway, that's still amazing, and I was wrong on that point.

Bitfinex, Poloniex and Kraken support the split. So does moving them to your own wallet (or an online one that supports it).
Gemini said that [they will try]( but there is no guarantee.
