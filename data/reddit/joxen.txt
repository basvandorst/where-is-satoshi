No fees, no charge backs.
Not a real merchant, but I do have a "hobby" in trading with game economies (TF2, CS:GO) and I've made a few thousand from it. Paypal's screwed me over A LOT with chargebacks, and the fees are huge for anyone sending outside of the US.

So if I decide to store my multibit "blablabla.wallet" on a flash drive for 10 years, in the future, I can open it with any bitcoin client? /s
I'm not looking to have ONE copy of a wallet in ONE format, I'm trying to NOT have all my eggs in one basket by having ONE copy of a wallet in ALL available formats...


Do paper wallets have a lower chance of becoming obsolete than [insert wallet format here]? Besides that, I've heard of the problems with physical access and that thing where you don't receive change back unless you specify an address, etc., and I don't really want to have physical, unencrypted money just lying around in my house.

Their address should send to the same wallet, no?

Takes 2 months to do.

So- I guess the answer is, I have to choose a file format to keep my wallet in, and pray that it's still going to be supported in 10 years.
Really no alternative? ;_;

So if I keep bitcoins in my .wallet file and multibit is no longer supported in 2020, I'm fucking screwed? Great.


Same thing, how do I convert from .electrum to .dat or .wallet? Why aren't there converting utilities for this shit?

I made a new bitstamp account purely for the purpose of testing this fake website. I logged into the legit bitstamp and it showed me my acct ID at the top right, which is normal.
Then I logged in to the fake one, and it somehow had the account ID even without me logging in manually.

Sell it on ebay/amazon and see if you can get 80% of your investment back...
Definitely a better choice than trying to get ROI by mining.

Can it be practically guaranteed that [file format] will be compatible with [bitcoin network in 10 years] through [potentially obsolete bitcoin client in 10 years], though?

So- for maximum compability- and minimal risk of losing bitcoins due to the network changing- I should just extract the private keys themselves and encrypt *that*. Got it.

The site's still online.
BUT LOG OUT OF BITSTAMP, CLEAR ALL COOKIES, AND HIT UP YOUR VPN BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

The rest of your post is just rambling against the prices that speculators create. Speculators always come and go in waves, and cause bubbles. People that buy at the top of bubbles almost never are really in it for the bitcoin, they're in it for the investment.
People that are truly interested in bitcoin tend to wait out the few months and buy it at the actual market price and use it in day-to-day buying.
