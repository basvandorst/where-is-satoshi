Trust is built on honesty.

No. I have missed this enormous upside. I thought about buying on the last pull back and didn't have the money. Now, I'm not sure I can justify buying it now at is total market value.

I am not fear mongering, I am trying to sincere in understanding and investing in something. However, if you can't take those questions I question its value, especially at these levels.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:06:21
I see the value in it, for sure. And the international appeal. I just think Bitcoin inherent value is overdone and bitcoin itself has unaddressed problems.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:09:45
Ok. Thanks

I invest a lot in companies and stocks. I have thought about getting in, however, I'm struggling with Bitcoin. I've bought 1 ethereum, because I like the value of the system. Bitcoin just seems a bit antiquated to me as far as the tech goes. Isn't even Litecoin better?

I want to make a coin called buttcoin :P

Or could lose everything. This reminds me of jargon with religion. The one true coin, the one true God. I don't believe in God anymore and I invested so much of my early life to it, four years in the seminary, and getting a theology masters, only to become an atheist. Yes, I see the value in blockchain and I see it as a real technology, however, I'm not sure I could be convinced that bitcoin has persistent inherent value if it solely relies on faith.

I actually want to invest, but am having a hard time agreeing with Bitcoin's value at these levels. And have genuine concerns and questions.

Ad hominem remarks now added to the list.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:10:10
I hear ya.

We don't have hyperinflation. It's also hard to say that zero inflation is good. There are benefits of inflation. Also isn't the scarcity of bitcoin completed annihilated by forks and the infinite amount of cryptos that can simply be created? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:00:46
just shows the ridiculousness of it all.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:00:32
lol, kinda :P Haven't heard of it till now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:04:47
No I had genuine questions before that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:10:33
I agree, but I started off without that attitude.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:02:47
Yes, but if anyone can print crypto by simply coming up with their own coin, then it's like everyone has access to a printing press from currency and it devalues everything. I get the fiat and network aspect. It just takes a lot of faith and I don't have that much faith in anything right now. I've been burned by things like that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:11:42
Maybe it is to the few people that own it?

Coinbase seriously rips you off with fees. I'm new to this but  omg! They get you on the fees, and then you buy retail which is like $100 off the asking price sometimes. This then inflates the price of Bitcoin even further. I see why people are saying this is a bubble.
