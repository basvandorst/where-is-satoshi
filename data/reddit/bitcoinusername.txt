The chances of all those happening at the same time are pretty slim.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:25:48
So you need to watch the mempool for old states being broadcast, is this right?  
And if so can't you just collude with a miner to include the old state in a block without sending the transaction to the mempool?
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:46:26
Coinbase is still using legacy addresses so even if you withdraw to a segwit address you won't benefit from fee reduction which happens only for segwit-segwit transactions. The complaints are about Coinbase still using legacy for receiving/outgoing transfers.

If we assume that LN will bring some amount of centralization its not like its the end of it all. We would still implement other scaling solutions and even a block size increase is not out of the question.  
In the end the path of least resistance will win.

There is no such thing as a free lunch.  
Stop chasing dragons, nobody is going to give you free money. Cloud mining is a scam prying on people bad at math.  
If you want to make big money you need to put in hard work and take big risks (or win the lotto, which is highly unlikely)
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:25:53
Yes it is possible. The exchange would simply send from their LN wallet to yours.

He did not say so in the whitepaper but in a forum post.  
Bitcoin also plans to increase the block size when all other solutions are maxed out.  
Although Satoshi was a genius, he was not a god so sticking by his words is kinda cultish.

Once a transaction is sent to the network you don't have the option to cancel it, it will be canceled when its dropped from the network which should happen in two weeks.

The link I provided you is the link to the Bitcoin Core repository and the parameter DEFAULT_MEMPOOL_EXPIRY defines after how many hours a transaction is dropped from the mempool. 336 hours aka 14 days.  
Thus your knowledge that the latest release of Bitcoin Core drops transactions after 2-3 days is proved otherwise by verifiable facts.

So much sense, so much wow!

That will be a major blow to all cryptocurrencies. If Bitcoin fails whos to say the new coin will not fail? Who is going to trust their wealth to an asset that was proved to fail once? Bitcoin is valuable because it has not yet failed, if it does the show is over.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:17:32
Small fee transactions is the last thing that its going to implemented in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is money and we don't care for peanuts.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:56:03


you're a tl;dr
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:10:39
Bitcoin is just math not personal opinions. Given that, do you know how many transactions are dropped from the mempool?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:31:34
Because if we concentrate power someone is gonna size it up and use it for evil things.

I agree. However consider their pov, they just found out about this thing called Bitcoin they see the prices going up and down $1k a day they freak out and not enough time to find out whats about. Just want to get on the hype train.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:17:22
Thats not what I'm talking about. If you're selling Bitcoin you need to do your homework and chose a trustworthy exchange.  
What I'm saying is shady exchanges exist because people don't do their due diligence.  
  
Edit: MtGox was known to be shady 9 months before the collapse but people just wouldn't listen, greed blinded them  
We have a similar case with one of the top exchanges that ripped people off several times and its expected to implode, yet people still blindly send them money.

When you chose to blindly trust a business because instead of doing your homework you prefer someone else does it for you how are you responsible?  
The whole world is build around stealing and enslaving the uneducated no matter the currency. Bitcoin gives you the option to free yourself but for that you have to learn not to trust everything you read on the internet.

The chosen way to scale Bitcoin is using secondary layers. The fees on chain will probably never get lower quite the contrary however solutions like LN are being worked on and they will bring cheaper fees.

You are correct.

You should run that in console or with bitcoin-cli depending if you use gui or not.  
Run this only on addresses with no funds, you can then send funds to the address starting with 3 and voila you now have funds in a segwit address which you can use to spend.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:40:58
Its no assumption. Thats the meaning of no regulation.

Now, you are just spouting nonsense. Not that it wasn't obvious that you're just a shill from the get go. Whats the pay like?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:01:22
miner reward = block reward + fees  
when block reward goes to zero the only reward are the fees. If we were to have an unlimited blocksize there would be no incentive to pay fees so we would have no miners. Given that the block size is limited we are assured theres always going to be fees and by modifying the block size we can control the miner reward.

The new paradigm Bitcoin is proposing is a new way of organizing ourselves where each individual is an autonomous party and the government arises from consensus with no central source of power up for grabs.  
Obviously as with any new paradigm and we humans being change adverse it is hard to see what this new world would look like. Beware of the Stockholm syndrome.

The block space is a scarce resource due to it being limited. This way people have to bid for block space with higher fees. We can use this limit to regulate the miner reward when the block reward goes to zero.

The environment is a problem because of our reckless spending. In a deflationary currency you're incentivised to think twice before spending money on useless shit.  Realize that Bitcoin proposes a paradigm shift and you're trying to see how old things are going to be done in the new world. Well, they're not going to be done the old way thats for sure. If you want to start a company and your idea is really good sure you will find investors but we will no longer throw money at things and hope it sticks.

Moving coins from one wallet to another is a transaction and you have to pay the fee, same for splitting. (You don't really need to split though, just send the amount you want to the exchange and the remaining will be sent to a change address in your wallet)

You are debunking OPs post using the current state of Bitcoin disregarding, and I'm not going to assume malicious intent here, that Bitcoin is in continuous development and not considered finished or ready for mass adoption. Bitcoin has been "debunked" by all sorts of people since its inception and time and time again Bitcoin made those specialists the laughing stock.
 &gt;Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? "What is Bitcoin" "how does Bitcoin work" "How do I get a bitcoin" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can "buy in".  
  
When the internet first appeared nobody thought my grandma  would be able to use an email account.  Any new technology and as complex as Bitcoin takes time till its simplified for everyone. But bitcoin is easy to use and understand now for all technically inclined people willing to spend a few hours studying it.
  


  
Things you do not understand are indeed scary. The problems you mention like lost coins and noname wallet exploits are not Bitcoin problems just as a robbed bank is not a problem of the fiat currency. 
  


  
Banks get hacked all the time due to technical problems (you are not affected due to insurance) however over the course of the history bank accounts were robbed by the state and you should be concerned as we have recent examples. Just because it didn't happen to you dosen't mean it won't.  


  
A 1 million dollar transfer from US to China costs $0.50, never in the entire history has there been something so cheap. The lightning network has no technical trade-offs but given that is even more complex than Bitcoin which seems hard for you to grasp I have doubts regarding your ability of passing such judgments.   
 &gt; Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!  
  
Thats funny because people have bought pizzas with Bitcoin and while currently its not cheap given a scaling solution being implemented they will again.  


 
Also true its the fact that the US dollar other currencies are going down every day. You are right that Bitcoin has no assurances because "no assurance" is better than being sure of being slowly robbed.  
  


  
You are right that if something as new as Bitcoin is not used by now by the entire world as a measure of unit it means it never will. /s  


  
You really hit the nail on the head with this one. By the time your scenario happens none of Bitcoin's difficulties would've been solved. /s
  
  
  
  
  
  
Whats funny is that you are the type of people OP warns about. You did a very poor job at hiding your incompetence with such a big wall of text which I'm sure everyone read and understood.

Transactions between Coinbase users are not recorded on the blockchain either (this are off-chain)  but depend on a centralized 3rd party.

24h is a too small time frame. Thats like saying we need to build bigger drainage pipes just because its raining today.
As evidenced by historical data  this occurrences are temporary and due to the fact that they get flushed from mempool at the same time, which is not natural, one can reasonably suspect they are malicious.  
Coincidentally, or not, everytime the mempool is full we get a swarm of users arguing for bigger blocks although the situation does not affect transactions by the same factor. Even the low fee transactions get confirmed when the mempool is "full".  
Blocksize increase is a scientific decision and it takes more "evidence" than that.

Bitcoin is still a new and experimental project. The scaling problem is one never solved before and we welcome any technical solution backed by real science. None has been able to provide it except big mouths on reddit.  
Andreas does a good explanation of the problem   
Bitcoin is not trying to beat other cryptocurrencies because it is the first and none of them has solved the real problems. A lot of them pretend to have solved it but none of them proved it in real world scenarios. If you are investing in untested solutions I wish you good luck just make sure you understand the technical part.  
Spam transactions do not pay anything because they are low fee transactions which never get confirmed. They are there just to fill the mempool and back up the narrative of people trying to sell us big blocks.  
As seen [here]( and explained [here](  the size of mempool is used as a scarecrow for the masses.

ofcourse s2x has not been a corporate takeover attempt lead by Barry whom is just a sock puppet of Jihan, one kid that is so overwhelmed by his success that sees himself as the savior of Bitcoin. They had tremendous community support like 8 men in suits and the collaboration of a very competent programmer.  
I'm eager to hear what you think BCH brings new to the table, what is its reason to exist? Or maybe you are not aware that it was created by the same Jihan and heavly promoted by another Bitcoin messiah like Roger Ver.  


Oh! but it does. Bitcoin is set to remove the middle man and that is all this successful business men are. They do not care about Bitcoin, they only care about their own pockets and control cause thats what money does to you.  
And then, here you are with your rhetoric trying to rewrite history knowing very well that often times people are misinformed and they tend to forget easy. Unfortunately for you Bitcoin has already defeated s2x, bch and soon Bitpay.

It is correct that not every user has to run the Bitcoin software and that already happens with light clients and 3rd party services but that does not imply that nodes need to be run only by miners. Satoshi got a few things wrong in the whitepaper, are you really following the whitepaper to the letter or just selectively?

Liquid was announced several years ago, the only people that did not know about it were the ones that did not care. As its said: the devil is always in the details. When you rely on slogans for understanding a situation you're just scratching the surface and everything seems simple: thats what happens in politics, religion and all areas were people are too busy to learn the facts and just want to be spoon fed. Fortunately so far Bitcoin has been resistant to the propaganda machine, but the FUD is not going to stop. Education is the only way forward.

It doesn't, every service is legit till it runs with your money.

Look at it the other way: it is a smart move taking funds from Jihad and use it for Bitcoin development. Bcash and Bitmain will be history. Thanks Bcash for the extra Bitcoin, thanks Jihad for digging your own grave.

Except that transaction costs are not calculated in Kwh. The banking system uses the same amount of resources even if they process 1tps or 50k tps. An airplane uses about the same amout of fuel for 1 passenger or 300.  
The energy cost of Bitcoin is not related to the number of transactions just as the energy cost of the internet is not related to the number of packets that go through it.

Thats exactly the reason why it will succeed. Bitcoin does not need your approval.

autoscaling is possible because the server farm is already live and using energy and because the internet is already functioning and because all those things below the fancy term autoscaling work without you realizing whats underneath.  In cloud computing you pay for what you use but go ahead setup a cluster farm in your own basement and see what its all about.  
It took over 60 years to make the internet work as it is today yet it comes easy to you because you were born into it and everything seems so simple because everything has been abstracted so you can touch your phone and things happen without you ever realizing whats going on all over the internet so you can see a picture of a cat.  
Bitcoin's scaling problems are problems that have never been solved before in the entire history of humanity, yet here you come and you think you got it.

Bitcoin removes the need for beliefs one way or another
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:10:39
Thats not what consensus is in Bitcoin. It needs to be close to 99% for that to happen. In a scenario of 60% wanting something else a currency split happens and two new currencies are born. People will decide which one will call Bitcoin but this blockchain will survive with the other 40%.  
The 60% cannot force the remaining 40% to go their way. Cryptocurrencies are voluntary.

This does not come to show that Bitcoin will succeed but that authority figures can be wrong. Think about that next time you believe what someone says just because of his position or profession.

None of those are Bitcoin's fault.

The difficulties in seeing this through is because you're trying to solve today's problems in a Bitcoin world. However Bitcoin is a paradigm shift and though it will have problems of its own they won't be the same problems we have now.  
In a Bitcoin world we wouldn't have the over consumption problem we have now and we probably would not even need ev because oil would be managed unwastefully. Tesla would be possible because good ideas will always get capital. Its just we would be more careful with what we invest in.

Bitcoin does not exist in a void. Those are "experts" that were wrong. Think about that next time you blindly believe whats being fed to you.

Bitcoin succeeds despite regulation. The rich dodge tax even if you're not ok with it so how are you going to regulate Bitcoin if you can't regulate the rich?

Porn has become so mainstream that is no longer the leading innovator.

Its none of your concern what other people need. It is every man's right to have as much currency as he pleases.  
You're not poor because other people have more money. You're poor because you're unskilled and sit your ass on the couch the whole day.
