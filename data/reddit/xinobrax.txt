Starts now...:

This crazy guy reimplemented the Bitcoin protocol back in 2011 ( and started the Bitcoin standardisation procedure (
So...I think he knows exactly what he's doing.
@_date: 2014-09-13 11:06:45
This one by the Khan Academy is even more in depth:

Well...actually I know a lot about BTC...and I'm sure that Andreas knows even more than me. I think he's a genius. I just don't like the term "expert". Whenever I see a so called "expert" in the news, I know for sure that the guy has no idea what he's talking about.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:21:14
Nope...how does it feel?
@_date: 2014-10-15 09:11:54
Actually you are the one who's trolling. Go to the Piratebay and search for it like everybody else...
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:03:34
He's definitly not a racist...why do you write such bullshit?
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:39:04
You seem crazy...without a balanced viewpoint. Think about it... (use any Elvis song as the background track)
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:45:32
This is just another positive comment.
@_date: 2014-11-27 13:20:27
So....you just made a new account for this post? I'm gonna trust you!
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:12:06
Ok, it's over now. This was a very very interesting discussion! A single guy just did, what the whole Bitcoin Foundation was unable to do within the past few months.
Thank you Andreas! 
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:25:41
This Reddit post IS the link ;) Just click on it...
@_date: 2014-09-15 07:53:21
Congrats! But I don't like the term "expert" :P
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:15:33
You can't use any card without a middleman...so...what's the point?
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:10:13

@_date: 2014-10-06 05:05:06
It's not a P2P system. It's based on credit cards...so it's actually more like the opposite...however they call it.
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:07:10
Btw, Switzerland has its own Bitcoin Subreddit: 
@_date: 2014-05-21 00:24:14
I follow his feed....so...I know for sure that there's not a single racist post....maybe because he's not a racist.
@_date: 2014-09-25 11:34:28
Sure, but it sounds like all the other cards won't work in the US, so this already is as low as possible. I think we all agree, that we shouldn't use any cards or middlemen at all....but that's not the topic ;)
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:43:08
You can order a [Skrill Prepaid Master Card]( and send BTC to the Skrill account using [VirWox]( ;)
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:17:01
Here's the recorded version: 
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:16:12
The recorded version is already on the website ;)
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:07:54
It's not even a real chat...it's just...well...chaos. The people over at CNN should watch Russia Today...maybe they could learn a few things...
@_date: 2014-10-16 07:39:10
Hey Sherlock, you're missing the point.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:26:13
What about...no? Please stay on topic. Maybe you're smart; like mad dumbass troll smart.
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:11:19
It's kinda like calling a private bank "Federal" Reserve....
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:25:14
lol, don't take me serious ;) I like the idea.
@_date: 2015-05-05 11:30:20
Ich heten abgholt :P
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:17:34
Your name should be dumbass
@_date: 2014-05-20 11:00:24
The first? Have you never heard of the [cryptex card](
However, there's no reason to use a debit card. Prepaid cards are much better and they've been around for more than 3 years now. Check [Skrill]( [XMLGold]( or [OKPay](
Btw, I use [VirWox]( to load my Skrill prepaid card with Bitcoins. Works like a charm, fees are low. So...why should anyone use a debit card instead?
@_date: 2015-05-08 11:11:30
It's not because we already know the answer. He does accept Bitcoins and knows how to use them. That's why I posted it...

This video has already been posted two months ago....but since it's Andreas it might be worth the repost...
@_date: 2014-09-18 09:37:33
lol? Isch doch eh nix los...
@_date: 2014-05-20 10:31:36
That's bullshit lol. Try to find a source for your stupid claim...
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:05:50
Similar background but nope...try again...

Calling it a conspiracy theory is like saying "yeah it's true and now shut up" these days...

Well, it's Larry Summers. It's hard not to fall asleep while he speaks. However, his words are very important for many big investors...

As far as I know there's no Reddit rule depending replies on own comments. But I'll stop it, people don't get what I'm saying anyways.
Using Tails is like screaming "Hey look at me, I'm doing something secret". It makes no sense to me at all...

You know, a few years ago people said the same thing about money creation...and then Satoshi came along. The "lobbying" by Andreas Antonopoulos seems to be much more efficient than everything the Bitcoin Foundation has done so far in this direction. We don't need any centralisation...what we need are experts with passion...and they are all over the place in this community.
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:26:35
Another downvote without a comment? Well then, let all the idiots use Tails...why not.
I guess we have no idea what we've been doing during the past 20 years.


@_date: 2015-04-02 16:58:18
Tails is a joke or a honeypot...people should use a BSD derivate instead...or a Kali...or simply a widespread dirstro like Ubuntu or Mint. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:20:41
Yes they do, but shipping usually takes a few weeks...
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:36:46
Who's downvoting this? Do you really think that using TOR on Tails is more secure than using it on an OpenBSD? Really? lol...
@_date: 2015-03-29 16:08:01
Yeah...I don't know why everyone is pushing the other one. I was 2 minutes faster XD

And this is how i made it:
1. Make an animation in Adobe After Effects
2. Export the frames
3. Make QR-Codes out of each frame using VisualQRC
4. Animate the frames in Adobe After Effects
