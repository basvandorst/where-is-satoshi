The important part to remember here is that there are no business owners behind bitcoin. Some anonymous japanese person or persons created the protocol. The easiest way to explain its' decentralized nature goes something like this:
New bitcoins are created to reward people for participating in an acitivty called mining which is the same activity that keeps track of all of the bitcoin transactions. There's a lot more to how to the system works but that is the piece that causes it to be decentralized.

It only ever had one real use that made it better than existing payment systems, buying illegal things online but it lost a lot of that market-share to volatility. Although since bitcoin isn't nearly as anonymous as people like to think it was never perfect for that use either.

Vendors know who the buyers are but the default settings on silk road have funds in escrow until delivery. Cancelling returns the funds. Escrow is hedged by default though unless the seller turns it off, when it's on nobody loses even if the vendor cancels the order.

To be honest, I think the only reason bitcoins didn't crash further was because Mt. Gox got overloaded. We've got a ways to go yet, I'll be surprised if we don't make it to $40-$50.

Yup, SR got in the game early enough that hedging made them a pile of extra money on bitcoins way up and they have followed through and ponied up when the value of bitcoins drops. It's funny how well run that site is considering what it is.

Out of curiosity, what on earth made you think that after tripling in price in a week or two the price could only go up? That actually makes no sense, nothings price should move that quickly.

I like your style, and I certainly won't argue with you about the idea that legal prostitution is a drastically different beast when it comes to safety for all parties.
I will make this observation though, it is likely (unlike my last post I actually don't have any data to back this up) that any country that legalizes prostitution would also have looser sexual norms and as a result the data would become extremely difficult to untangle.
I'll recommend the book to you that I always think of when talking about this sort of thing, not because I think you need the education but because I think you'd find it interesting, [The Wisdom of Whores]( worth noting you can read the whole book through the look inside link if you have a handy device for it. It's a really fascinating book on HIV because it a lot of evidence based policy suggestions that fly straight in the face of conventional thinking, something I think you'd appreciate.

Even more than that, most orders on silkroad are hedged. This means that if the seller cancels an order when bitcoins are on the way up silkroad eats the profits and return a same value number of bitcoins to the person buying things. If bitcoins are on the way down when your order is canceled you get more bitcoins back then you put in.
For a silk road user who only buys as many bitcoins as they need at a time there is almost no risk in the fluctuations.

So the only real problem with single men paying for sex is that prostitutes make great centers for the spread of if STI's. In the case of HIV specifically you are never more contagious than shortly after you get it so prostitutes can be outright dangerous.
Amusingly, cultures with more restrictive sexual norms have significantly higher rates of HIV transmission due in large part to the fact that more men visit prostitutes since they can't reasonably get sex for free. In countries with where men can get sex for free prostitutes get bored and STI's lose one of their strongest avenues for infection.

This is truth.

During the crash the exchange rate was still too high on SR for a bit. They changed it to some other index pretty quickly though. SR really does have its shit together, weird as that is. I suppose if your money came during the crash it would suck, but you would have had to be an asshole buyer (or not understand how things work) to finalize during that time.

That's just stupid, if you FE and the price crashes any significant bit more the seller has no good reason to honor your order. Only make orders that are hedged right now, protects both you and the seller with downward volatility.

The really messed up thing about this though is that orders on SR are hedged by default. People got mad at sellers who did this because they turned that option off to make more money as the value of bitcoins rose and then were unwilling to bite the bullet when the value dropped.
Of course, I think any buyer who made an unhedged order when bitcoins were clearly rising in value much too quickly was a fool because it really wouldn't make sense for sellers to be willing to take a loss.
