Signature works in the US because no one checks and it's not even asked for most of the time. It's checked way more often and is required for pretty much every transaction outside the country though. Also, some unattended machines won't accept US cards because there's no PIN. I think our cards should have gotten a PIN at least on a secondary basis if only to ensure compatibility.

Yes, but our credit and debit cards are finally kinda catching up. "Kinda" because [the cardholder's still going to be verified with a signature]( and not a PIN (with a few exceptions).


Not quite. In order to be able to clone one you'd need to get the private keys inside the chip somehow. No one has been able to do so to date (and even if they could, it's a lot more difficult than just hacking some online store or cloning the magstripe). That said, chip does have some security vulnerabilities but they're either the result of badly programmed credit card terminals or require the physical card to pull off.


[I'd say it did work, at least for in-person fraud]( (Chart is for the UK.) There was a spike in counterfeit fraud but it did start going down again as other countries implemented chip as well. Online fraud was never supposed to be solved with chip, so there are other solutions like 3D Secure that are being rolled out now.

It's not because of Apple Pay. Visa/MasterCard rules permit not asking for a signature if the transaction's under $25/$50 (I forget which). Amex is similar. Of course, it all depends on the merchant too. I guarantee you'll get the same results by swiping at these places.
There's also something in the EMV specs that the iPhone can send over in theory that will eliminate signature/PIN altogether for credit cards but it's not right now; they won't really be able to until the [US chip card migration]( is farther along.

The headline makes it seem like all of them are shunning it when in reality [it's a group of companies headed by Walmart]( Their app is [also a security and privacy nightmare](

Chip not being adopted is more of a case of it not being worth the money to banks (well, [until recently anyway]( I'd be interested to hear more about this patent thing.

[Technically chip and signature]( but still, chip is coming finally!

The NFC thing has been getting better though. I wouldn't be surprised if it was accepted at the majority of places in a couple of years.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:29:18
Wait, when did chip start working at Target? I thought the only major retailers with it turned on right now are Home Depot and Walmart.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:24:21
Walmart and Home Depot have working readers and [there might be a smaller business near you with them too](
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:29:59
I'm betting most will turn on nearly simultaneously around October, but we'll see.

I haven't used either but if they work the same as Google Wallet it takes 1-2 business days to transfer to/from the service itself. Transfers between users within the service are effectively instant though; the recipient doesn't have to wait for any auto-replenishment/transfer to happen into the sender's account. That is, if your balance is $0 and you send $20 to someone, the service temporarily covers that amount for you so that the recipient can get their balance credited for that amount immediately (and auto-initiates a $20 transfer from your bank account into the service so it can get paid back).
The main problem (if one considers it a problem) is that you have to sign up for a third party service.

PayPal takes longer I think and it's geared more towards people buying things from sellers rather than person to person money transfers.
Also, not sure about other banks but BofA [seems to have something like that]( in their app. No idea if it's instant.

I find that I get a better rate by using a card (even at an ATM) than by exchanging cash at a money changing booth or bank. There are cards that don't have fees when you use them abroad (e.g. Capital One's credit cards or a Charles Schwab bank account/debit card if you don't want a credit card).
Also there are at least a few countries now where cash use is extremely uncommon so a card of some sort will come in handy.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:52:28
I have chips on my cards but barely anywhere to use them so far.
@_date: 2015-07-27 00:05:33
Actually, they're going to be used in the US eventually lest businesses be liable for fraud. [More info](@_date: 2015-04-05 03:32:46
[Badly implemented card terminals are at least partly to blame](

A lot of places are finally upgrading their stuff because of the [upcoming liability shift for chip]( Tap isn't officially supported by a lot of places yet even though it's "turned on" but I've had good luck with Apple Pay most of the time. Tapping definitely would have been a lot more difficult to do a year ago though.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:26:43
It used to be on the cards but banks got rid of it when they started adding chip. Seems like they'd rather we use stuff like Apple Pay if we want to use contactless. OTOH for those who still have the contactless cards, acceptance has gotten a whole ton better (it was never good before).
@_date: 2015-04-17 14:24:31
The liability goes to the merchant if they don't support chip and they swipe a chip card. I'm pretty sure tap isn't affected by that but I'd have to go find the card brand rules again and look that up.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:37:09
It'll still cut down on card cloning but it doesn't help in the case where your card gets pickpocketed or something like that. The downside is that some places outside the US will have trouble with most of the cards they're issuing but as long as the card itself has a PIN that probably won't be an issue. ([details here](

Europe (where OP is presumably from), Canada and Australia seem to be on the ball with NFC payments. It's America that's behind.
@_date: 2015-11-16 23:51:37
Retailers being unhappy with fees isn't exactly a new thing. What bugs me is that they managed to get massive concessions put into law, yet it's apparently not enough for them. Concessions such as being allowed to charge extra for card use and imposing minimums for using cards, not to mention a very low cap on the amount that can be charged to run a debit card. If they're that unhappy, why not take advantage of the stuff they helped get put into law? Or even go as far as to become debit/cash only like Arco and a few others?
Seriously, I don't think retailers in any other country have complained nearly as much about fees as American ones yet have seemingly done little about the situation even when given tons of new tools to steer people towards cheaper forms of payment.
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:51:01
It's actually built into the terminal now instead of there being an external antenna. [Example video]( from someone who used Google Wallet at Panera Bread, who was one of the initial Apple Pay retailers.
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:14:45
What I've always wondered is why cards can't have 2-3 separate card numbers:
1. Magstripe card number (will auto-decline for card not present transactions)
2. Chip/contactless card number (will also auto-decline just like  Could probably be the same number as  without affecting security.
3. Embossed card number on the front (will auto-decline for everything but card not present)
If issuers did that then if there was another Target style breach, crooks wouldn't be able to use the numbers online either. And definitely can't produce counterfeit cards once EMV becomes widespread.

[At least in the US Costco is selling EMV terminals for $99](
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:33:38
One problem is terminals that [don't use random numbers that are actually random]( That's hardly the fault of the EMV specification.
The CVM downgrade attack is irreverent in countries that have adopted chip and signature, like [the US](And that still requires the physical card anyway. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:28:32
Except banks in the US used to issue those cards and stopped because everyone still swiped them instead of tapping. They probably wouldn't have even considered giving NFC/contactless another chance had Apple Pay not come out.
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:48:22
We are at least a decade out from that, if ever. [Chip and signature (not chip and PIN) in the US]( will make sure that NFC isn't accepted nearly everywhere that it could be. Why have a customer accessible reader when almost no one will have to enter a PIN? For a smaller business, that's a really unnecessary expense unless they accept debit cards.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:46:24
Don't they already keep track of PINs so you can do a cash advance?
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:42:09
Actually, the CC companies do absorb the fraud costs. [Which is why they're finally working towards adopting chip in the US](@_date: 2015-03-10 20:27:00
So the liability for the amount of the transaction has typically always been on a party other than the merchant. EMV changes that. 


MasterCard’s liability shift, which takes effect October 1, 2015. This liability shift
directly affects acquirers and issuers as it pertains to counterfeit fraud. This means
that the party, either the issuer or merchant, who does not support EMV, assumes
liability for counterfeit card transactions. In addition, MasterCard supports a
liability shift for lost, stolen, and never received or issued (NRI) cards to the party
that does not support PIN as a cardholder verification method. If neither party
supports PIN, only the counterfeit liability shift rules apply. The liability shift does
not apply to Automated Fuel Dispensers (AFDs) until October 1, 2017.
Also, from 


Let’s refresh our memory when it comes to who is liable to pay for fraud. For fraud that occurs in the card-present world, the card association typically picks up the costs for fraud. However the merchant will still have some associated costs that are not covered by this. These include the costs to process an order, to handle the charge-back, the shipping costs, etc. The merchant will also have to pay a charge-back fee.

Set/reset the PINs via the bank's website. Unlike in other countries we don't actually need to store the PIN on the cards.
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:11:42
OTOH any bank worth a damn would probably see the brute force attempt and lock the card after the first couple of failures.
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:57:37
Eventually. My experience seems to be that they turn on the NFC part of the new equipment right away but not the chip part. Perhaps they're all [waiting for October]( because they don't really need to until then. (Doesn't explain why Walmart turned theirs on last year though.)
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:43:31
So far I've been seeing more places that support NFC than support chip.
