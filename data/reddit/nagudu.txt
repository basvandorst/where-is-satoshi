I felt awful when it dipped from $1,000 down to $200 or so and I didn't buy any. And now I have no money to spend :(

It is 11.9% in the US. I likewise feel bad when I see people doing this at my local Walmart, when there are half a dozen banks in town that will do this free for any members or for a generally much smaller flat fee for non-members.

CNBC is the same one that ran this headline news story last year:
# **Bitcoin headed to $100,000 in 2018, says analyst who predicted last year's price rise**

Although in doing so you'll lose 12% just on the cash exchange fee, then another 4+% on the bitcoin transaction.

But when you change the "1 Year" dropdown to "All Time" it still seems pretty great.
