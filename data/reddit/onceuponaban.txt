For the record, this is the exact reason there is unrest over the EU flag at the FR/DE overlap.

It's actually the Eiffel Tower.
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:21:49
Not anymore that's for sure, as their flag is being attacked from multiple directions.

You'll notice that the German flag has a lot more space than that. We're also running out of space to expand there as we're going to collide with the Void soon. We will expand both ways either way, and it will probably be better for both of our groups if it happens without conflict.

I don't think it's that specific, mostly old national rivalry.

The black border as it is currently drawn would probably be okay, however there is still conflict over the color of the area that is outside that border.

This conflicts with our plans for the French flag, would [this]( be okay?
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:39:19
Again, this is needless conflict.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:03:41
I'd suggest moving to the left **by a lot**. If you look at France's flag, you'll notice there is some green in it because of a r/all assault, due to [this]( thread. Most of the counter-proposals involve putting flags to the left of our flag. *Right where you currently are.*
~~In fact, the patch of red creeping up on your logo is probably the beginning of a Spanish flag, as planned by the German place Discord server.~~
EDIT: Actually, no, it's apparently not related to the Germans.

And for added hilarity, a thread from has screwed things up with a proposal that no one on any coordinated discord server wants. So now we're basically fighting the hivemind because of Europe. Insert witty reference to current events here.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:17:08
See, that is needless conflict. Would [this]( be okay?
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:45:59
I can assure you that the issue has been brought up over and over on all relevant Discord servers.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:40:34
Tell that to the German who not only have an even bigger flag but also overwrote ours.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:36:02
Sorry, but this won't happen. Our expansion will continue with or without your cooperation. We could accept larger borders than [what has been previously set]( but you're not getting the full square.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:56:54
What goes around comes around. They will wake up eventually, and if Place is still up by then all of this will have been for naught.

Hello. I come from and you guys seem to lack an instant messaging service to coordinate over this so I'm posting here (If I'm mistaken, could you give me the adress?).
We are expanding south but do not plan to overwrite the Bitcoin logo. We are losing pixels due to the contested area between the flag and your logo. Is there some sort of agreement we could come to?
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:02:10
Don't say I didn't warn you guys :\^)
EDIT: Relevant [post](
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:07:29
Do you guys really want to make his pants a three-way struggle? :\^)
