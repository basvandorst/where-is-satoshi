that's awesome dude. When did you sell?

That's great!
Install the dogecoin-qt wallet - I can't link the download site right now as I'm at work. Just google it. 
Launch it once then close it. 
Then I believe it will create a folder called Dogecoin in C:\Program Files (x86) or in AppData not sure where. Just search Dogecoin in Windows and find the folder. 
Delete the wallet.dat in there and replace with your one you found.
Make sure to *copy* the one you found from it's original location, not cut, you don't want to lose it! That's your coins!
Then launch the dogecoin-qt client again and wait forever for it to sync (the blockchain is large.)
Good luck and let me know how many you ended up having!

Yeah dude .. go try and find your wallet.
I remember mining for MONTHS back in the day using so much power costs and finally getting to 350,000 Dogecoin and calling it quits. Back then they were worth like $190 so I decided to hold.
Fast forward to 2 days ago I fire up the wallet for shits and gigs and they're worth fucking $1400 CAD
Fast forward to today and they're worth fucking $1696 !!!
I really don't know what to do ..

That's 200 bucks Canadian! Not bad. 
Yeah, it's huge. You can always check your address on the blockchain to see its balance. 
Once the blockchain is fully downloaded you can move to the Multidoge client which syncs pretty much instantly. See for more info. Happy dogecoining!

I have 0.128, why do you want that specific amount?
