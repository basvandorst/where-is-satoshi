Check out our new site, we are helping to connect bitcoin with bands.

Thanks for the feedback. Yes, we only have a few videos up for testing purposes and we will have an actual front end when we have the full release. I just gave you content creator access, re log in and click your name, you should see an upload link now. 
We ask that you only upload SD and not HD at this time, try and keep them shorter, like under 7 minutes (exceptions can be made) and price them low to encourage testing. 
Thanks again!

Not at this stage but that is an interesting idea. What we will have is the option to go and find a creator, tell them about the platform, load up their videos for them and you could receive whatever percentage you negotiate with them.

Give it a try now. Log in again and click your name on the top right, you should see an option there.

Did you get approved? If not, what is your user name on the site?

If your goal is to receive content provided by corporate committees, and you enjoy sitting through sales pitches, you are correct.
If you enjoy supporting creators you enjoy and want to see them compensated fairly as opposed to paying mega corporations and wall street, use watchmybit.com

You do realize you are complaining about a half of a penny per view? Such profits!
