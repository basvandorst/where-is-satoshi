In the release they gave a date and time that their system was hacked. My funds disappeared at that exact time..... My 2fa was active although afterwards would not let me log in and I had to reset it.... Which took a week or so and then realised my funds were gone. I had several emails at that time ie login emails and one to say API had been enabled. I find it a pretty big coincidence that all my funds go missing inside a 2 minute time frame that binance announced they were hacked..... Doesn't phishing require you to login to steal the login details? I hadn't logged into my account since the 29th Jan as I was away.... Surely all of this is no coincidence?

Look good? It wasn't disabled I said it wouldn't work. Ie when I tried to enter the 6 digit code it wouldn't accept it anymore. So I had to reset. I'll post up some pictures when I get home tonight. How would posting any of this make me look good? How would I pull a swifty on binance? Your a half wit mate!! If i knew the answer I wouldn't be posting it on here!! So my suggestion is of you don't know maybe go annoy someone else!! If there is no solution then there is no solution sad for me but would be remiss of me not to ask when I have lost thousands of dollars. Typical know all fuck wit.. Your arguenent about being coincidental is exactly what I am saying.... Can't be a coincidence. I'll post pictures tonight

To what?

It was google authentication 2fa not SMS message. After hack the google authentication did not work anymore and I had to reset the whole thing which took about a week. Considering I hadn't been on my computer for 2 months before the hack how did they get my email password etc and login details? To phish an account they steal your login. To change API settings you have to verify from email.... Considering its my account I probably have a fair idea of what was active and what wasn't.... And you're saying that it's pure coincidence that all this happened right in a 2 minute time frame that binance themselves released the time.....
