hahaha np im used to it , but i try to learn =] 
and i never said u should buy right now, i said to hold what u got, i guess i shoulda point it out. obviously i can see it going lower but selling now is just not right, imo again.

its funny but without these "newbs" the price won't be what it is. not gonna give details but i know a few ppl who have invested over 100k+ just to make profit, not cause they understand / care bout the tech behind it. im sure theres Thousends of ppl like that, who invest just to make profit and its fine. without them mass adoption will never happen.

what? what does "support" means?

litecoin? it is currently 41$ from what i can see?
should i drop 300$ there? i've never heard of that coin before so im wondering
might be a fun time trying to do it with a cheap coin this time instead of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:51:19
aight ty! sounds interesting =D
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:09:27
can you really see bitcoin crashing tho? the hype is just too strong, i can't see it going below 5000$ ever again. (but then again im new to this, so let me know if u think otherwise).
