As someone who has been on LocalBitcoins since near the beginning, the advice to only trade with users with 100+ trades should only apply to purely online trades. I know that isn't what the OP was asking but for all the cash traders, that amount of trades is hard to get as each trade is met person to person.Here's my profile that would be affected by this advice  is my profile if you want to see an example High rep but &lt;100 trades profile.
Localbitcoins has been my favorite way to trade bitcoin for almost 2 years now and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and more anonymous bitcoin trade. Anybody feel free to PM me if you have any questions on how to buy/sell on LocalBitcoins as I really would love to see the economy on this site grow.

Hello I'm tolan77 the trader that is being talked about here.
My price is definitely insane I do realize that and I really don't like it myself either, however I do this full time to pay for my living expenses while pursusing my double major and try to preemptively pay off as much student loans as possible.  With the volatility like it is and gift cards being as hard to get your money back out of as they can be. I have to charge high rates to insure it's worth my time and that my bills get paid. I have tried my best to lower my rates but every time I do a bubble or a burst of a bubble timed at the wrong time  in my gift card trading screws me over. I deal with USD as infrequently possible as I decided to join the experiment first hand and have lived the last 3yrs of my life making my living purely in bitcoin so while on paper it seems like an easy dollar profit, with volatility of bitcoin and volatility of gift cards it can get pretty chaotic and hazy when calculating my real profit when making bitcoin.
Also since I allow my traders to remain anonymous if they wish, I have the added risk of taking anonymous gift cards that I have to account for in my pricing. I have to do extensive scam prevention since, as you said, there is a ton of shady people out there and a good 1% of traders I've dealt with try to scam me with stolen gift cards (haven't had any on paxful yet though)  and I have to be very careful not to accept those. There is no other trading method online that allows you to purchase bitcoin anonymously other than my service that I know of.
I have been doing these p2p trades for 3 yrs with a perfect 100% rep on localbitcoins and I work hard to maintain that level of feedback everywhere I go.
I have also been part of the bitcoin community since 2012 with a perfect rep on bitcoin talk. Though I haven't been there in awhile and it looks like the rep system is no longer around.
While I can understand the complaints for being pricey I really don't like being called a scammer when I go out of my way to be as fair and honest with the people who trade with me as I can.

You don't understand. They don't update the protocol and then everybody is instantly updated. Everyone has a choice whether to upgrade or not. The recent fork debacle was caused by a lot of miners not upgrading to the new .8 protocol so everyone had to voluntarily downgrade back to .7 If a protocol update wasn't in the best interests of bitcoin miners/users users don't have to upgrade. It only becomes the primary protocol and causes a fork when more than 51% of miners are using it. Every upgrade will have to be completely open source so if there is anything nefarious the community can hopefully recognize this and get the word out not to upgrade.

@_date: 2013-03-29 18:12:34
They cannot dilute shares they have it set to be able to add shares without vote because the passthrough allows you to add your own privately held shares to the passthrough if you'd like to trade on there. It does not 'dilute shares' because the total shares doesn't change (400,000). I think the payout is more realistic than these other crazy bitcoin stocks and personally like where ASICMINER is going. Different strokes for different folks I guess.
EDIT: An interesting sidenote. You are considered a board member of ASICMINER if you have 5000+ Shares. Every boardmember will eventually be provided an ASICMINER machine. Since the passthrough has accumulated more than enough to get a boardmember seat, it will eventually be sent an ASICMINER machine, which DeaDTerra has promised to run and include in dividends.

Looking at the most recent transaction id for what I assume is the transaction you are talking about. blockchain.info appears to report it as a double spend
Which it claims is a double spend of 
So apparently you must've tried sending twice at the same time. And since this is technically a double spend the blockchain has rejected the transaction thus why it's hanging at unconfirmed.
EDIT: I believe after thinking for more than 5 seconds this is not the probable cause for the double spend but I'm to tired to really delve deeper into the cause atm.

I've made multiple sales on localbitcoins and this has hit me pretty hard before. I usually just keep my offers a good several dollar float above current gox price and try to complete offers ASAP so both me and the customer get the rate we want. I usually honor most arrangements unless the prices goes above 3-5$ per btc over my rate, which is a partially acceptable loss to me since almost no way else gets your dollars to you that quickly. Seriously, don't see canceling a request as 'wrong' on localbitcoins if you've made the effort to meet within a resonable time and the price rapidly changes against you. It's only wrong if you have set up escrow service. The buyers can just as easily (AND DEFINITELY DO) cancel when the deal goes the other way and bitcoins drop in value. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:00:16
There's literally no reason to use Craigslist alone when there is localbitcoins.com. If a seller isn't willing to use localbitcoins as a basic escrow service for cash then it's pretty likely it's a scam.

If you post an ad you can automatically have it adjust based on mtgox price + a commision of your choosing.While to actually make sales on localbitcoins it does take money to make money you don't neccesarily HAVE to have any actual bitcoins to just place an ad, you only need them to finalize and complete a transaction. So if you want you could go ahead and place one just to gauge interest in your area and if you get a lot of offers you know it might be a decent idea to pick up some bitcoins. I would also throw a listing up on craigslist linking to your localbitcoins listing for some added publicity. However while I use localbitcoins as an easy way to convert bitcoins into ways to pay my IRL bills I think you'd have to be in a pretty populated area to consider making real money of of it. If you have any particular questions about selling on localbitcoins you can shoot me a pm and I'll try to help you out.

You can change the fee in Armory, I send &lt;.0005 btc fee transactions all the time. If you have certain small input transactions in what you're sending it will make you pay a fee. This is why armory is sweet because you can make sure you don't generate many small input transactions by using coin control to keep all your coins together.

Seems like something one could very easily do as a mathematical genius. His entire argument was based on the fact that he's looking for a man that does what some consider a life's work in 3-4 years.

The difference between this and car sales is Garr has already paid the money and agreed to the deal.This is about a refund for having to wait &gt;1yr for his spiffy new car and seeing people who ordered sooner than him get theirs first. It's also as if you paid in dollars but since the manufacturing costs was in pesos you were forced to get pesos back. Regardless of whether dollars are no worth much much more. So a refund in this case is different.

They refund you in btc, so say you bought it originally when btcs were $12 dollars apiece and it costs 1200$ so you paid 100btc. If you asked for a refund today, they would give you ~26btc due to the market rate being almost 4x more expensive.Thus why I said you get screwed

Trendsetter37 has got it mostly right. Bitspend is great! They do more than just internet items as long as it's a checkout that accepts a credit card and can be logged into bitspend will do it. As an experiment I've gotten them to pay for a bunch of weird things so it never hurts to try to ask them to pay for something.Though technically bitspend to me is counted as converting to fiat since they technically spend fiat. I've never tried the bitcurex debit card but I've done btc-moneypak-debit card before.

Today I bought some brake pads for my mustang using bitspend and I was honestly astounded by how fast they got my invoice up and the order in. There was a little bug in the invoice and including fixing that the entire process took only 34 minutes from sending the initial order form to having my tracking number for my package. I have to say so far so good this service is damn excellent and I will most definitely be back. 
Edit: I know they used to do everything by hand but they discussed having an automatic system soon I'm wondering if they have implemented that yet. I would love to invest in this company if that would be possible in anyway as I can see them going far if they keep the same level of service.

ASICMINER is selling shares of it's company. Each share is 1/400,000th of the company. So currently with the 6TH/s they have running each share is around 15Mh/s . However these shares update as ASICMINER get's more and more hashrate. So when their planned 12TH/s goes online your shares automatically update to ~30MH per share. And asicminer has a planned 50TH farm and an eventual 200TH farm.
Also they are planning on eventually selling their boards but currently they just want to get their farm up and running.

This is my basic guess. If you forgot to include a fee with your transaction, it might be taking a lot of extra time to get included in a block if there were a ton of transactions. Miners prioritize transactions with fees. It would help if you could link us to the transactions on blockchain.info

I'm curious what method they used to tabulate this statistic. Are they taking all bitcoin transacted this year and multiplying by the current price? The Price of bitcoin for most of this year has been 5-10x less than it is now, so if they are just using total bitcoin transacted and multiplying by the current price this figure is extremely misleading. If however they actually did transact $100 million dollars in value directly to merchants that is indeed a very interesting metric and speaks a lot to the success of bitpay's business model.
