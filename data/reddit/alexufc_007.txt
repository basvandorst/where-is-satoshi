we need to keep a count of the amount of btc in these “stories”
Every week someone always writes how they got into btc like 5-6 years ago but lost it all in their computer, wallet, cleaned their hard drive, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:59:35
what you did is a panic sell (not hodL). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:43:03
wow....yeah not good soo much for coffee &amp; Burger King 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:40:32
ok thank u for the better estimate ( I was guessing on the low side) so just hoDL guys we know this thing will run it up long term 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:05:34
I read an article earlier this year(I think coin telegraph) where some finance person says if the value was matched, there would be about 1000 ounces of gold for every one btc ! so yeah roughly a million dollars for each btc I think is the projected target  
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:39:13
u gotta make a move bro,,,,chances make champions 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:02
it’s waiting for you to sell, then it’ll go to $36,000 loll 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:32
Yes! Plz Shower &amp; make an omelette breakfast then re-check it 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:56:24
Yes the train is already moving,,,,,,Q1 2018 it will easily be in the 20K-40k range 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:09:59
we need to keep a number track of these “stories”.....every week ppl post the “same” story about how their computer from 2010-2011 has 10-80 btc and they need help with access, etc, etc....
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:39:07
Get a krakken account &amp; but other alt coins....at this point btc is for adults only yeee
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:14
yeah in reality  that means we just buy more loll....btc 25-35k in January!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:12:20
yeah let’s just centralize are decentralized cryptos...
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:28:26
agreed. Just wait until we are 50k-65k per coin.
all these fud posts are just ppl who didn’t get btc loll real ppl that are holding don’t spread fud/bad vibes 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:15:10
-1 loll 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:22:16
yeah Bloomberg hating on btc oh what a shocker...loll
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:37:35
Run it up!!!! 25-30k New Year’s Eve!! Yeee 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:12:47
agreed. but later this week I will take one for the team and sell 1 btc...and then the 2018 bull run will begin!! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:08:54
I love all these weird techy random questions that pop up loll my favorite part of this community 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:14
If it was not truly valuable then Wall Street would’ve never created this “futures” thing for it.....they know the tables are turning currency is not property of the state it’s property of the people!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:42:47
Agreed....roughly 1-1.5 million coins will be “lost” due to lost keys, kriminal seizures, etc...so they will be even rarer!! $$$ all the way up 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:24:12
More like 19,500,000
you can count 1.5million +\- as lost or siezed or destroyed or lost pass codes 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:37:55
Russia &amp; other countries have mining farms 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:54:18
easily 2-3 million coins are gone for good,,,,,so in reality we are closer to the total amount of btc that will be readily available to public now &amp; in the future... just last week 200k btc (worth billions) was seized in Eastern Europe by gov officials (Bulgaria)
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:20:41
no bank gives a fresh faced 18 year old a 100k loan for college....ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:18:34
Badass brotha!! if she tells u where she got it plz come back &amp; post yeee 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:04:40
This only profitable as a whale,,,,$1000 buy ins won’t cut it anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:00:07
I’m thinking like 19.5 (+/-) million total will be a good rough estimate....it’s definitely not going to be 21 million coins anymore (too many lost/seized/etc all over). * they will be worth more then loll 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:16:28
What did you do two years ago that made you forget about sending the coins ?!?!?!? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:49:11
it’s awesome how all these ppl can at least help with the tech ideas!!! best of luck  
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:03:12
Future advice, sounds weird...but once you click on an order  &amp; it says the “error” message, immediately click it again (that’s how I’ve made it work on my side),,,,,I’ve been meaning to type this for a while every week ppl hate on krakken loll

@_date: 2017-12-23 19:09:41
hmm good question....someone could easily profit selling from multiple exchanges...loll 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:37:59
dude futures is betting it’ll be like 19K by mid January...so yeah take that info &amp; run with it yee 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:42:19
It’s not 21million....realistically it’s more like 19.5million due to some lost on paper/computers/seized/lost codes/etc...so yes even less ppl will have them 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:42:53
For the last bubble Its dropped up to 80% in the past....from like 1100 to $200. so yeah pretty much anything is game wow!

So 4K is not unreasonable....still from 1700 this spring yo 4K would be a huge profit
