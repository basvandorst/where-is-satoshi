For everyday usage more than two decimal places *are* kind of hard, because it's uncommon outside of a scientific context. And I may be culturally biased here, but in europe small drink bottles contain 0.33 liters, the height of a person may be 1.74 meters, and so on. Even non-decimals are expressed with double-digit sub-units, like a train departing at 7:23. Casually this is the most common format for many measures besides currency and it seems appropriate to conform to that.

I'm not sure what your argument is. Use µBTC and you'll never need to round anything, as two decimal places are satoshis. Call it "bits" and all problems are solved: It's a single unit with a catchy name that allows for absolute precision using the traditional amount of decimal places. You can still round it if you like, but you don't need to.

As a result the user needs to trust the merchant's conversion rate and loses the ability to casually verify the fiat amount within the wallet.

Your theory is plausible. Anyone looking to sell more than a thousand coins on spot is going to wait for a good setup and open shorts before dumping. As we're getting closer to the confluence of resistances (MA200, meme downtrend, 7,800 linear) I'd expect the dump to commence when a test of the MA200 is rejected or immediately afterwards, it's the perfect setup. On the other hand, the same play would've gone down on each of the former encounters with our beloved MA200 just as well. I fail to understand why *now* is the time to get these old coins out of storage and prepare the attempt. What were they waiting for? What is different today?


And the shorts are up by 11k BTC whereas longs dropped, so someone cash-bought 11k BTC within a few hours while being nowhere near a traditional long-entry. This is even more suspect and suggests there might not be two separate entities involved, but only one. If multiple accounts of the same entity made these trades, their net exposure hasn't changed. (Account A started with USD and cash-bought BTC; Account B started with BTC and short-hedged 100%.) The only result seems to be the manipulated margin stats: BTCUSDSHORTS appears 30% higher than it actually is. I'd read that as a weak attempt at comforting potential buyers. Not really worth the cost/risk, something's missing here.

So then anybody can buy an arbitrator account and request passport scans and selfie videos from individuals involved in bitcoin trading? This sounds even worse than the status quo.


The dispute policy clearly states that the ID process is recorded. The resulting files are extremely valuable and arbitrators might decide to keep them for selling in the future. Or they lose the data by accident while it is stored temporarily. We're talking about some of the most sensitive information people in this space have; giving it to random anonymous arbitrators who can do with it whatever they want doesn't seem like a good idea.

The *average* tx fee includes batched transactions with lots of outputs, multisig transactions, ridiculous outliers in fee estimation, and so on. It is not what people *actually pay* for their boring 1-in-2-out transactions, and totally not what they *need to pay* for quick confirmations. Stop advocating for bad metrics. [Median fees]( are somewhat closer to reality although still far from being a good approximation, they came back down to summer 2016 levels after segwit activated.

No, it isn't. That's a common misconception. The purpose of TA is to anticipate scenarios that are more likely than others; to identify the path of least resistance and entry/exit levels with a favorable risk-reward ratio. TA doesn't claim to make predictions that are *reliably correct*, it claims to provide an edge in a game of probabilities that supports being profitable *on average* over many trades. It works because human decisions are heavily biased by emotion and tend to follow the same patterns over and over again. 


There is no single technique that works reliably. Again, that's not what TA is supposed to do. Instead, there's a wide variety of techniques which can be applied to different timeframes. A confluence of signals from multiple indicators on multiple timeframes can contribute to a high-RR setup, often in conjunction with other data (like the amount and health of longs/shorts, available margin funding, premium and open interest on futures, order flow, etc). I see no harm in communicating these ideas, after all I'm just another random person on the internet. No one is going to front-run me and it's interesting to talk about stuff.


Obviously some traders beat the overall market average. I did. You can't have "everyone below average", that's not how an average works.

I honestly don't understand the end-game you have in mind. Any POW cryptocurrency that is heading towards mainstream adoption will necessarily have a high market cap and pay serious amounts of money to miners. The subsequent professionalization/centralization of mining seems unavoidable.
After a reset-by-POW-change and with the general incentives set by the system left unchanged, why do you think these dynamics will turn out differently next time? As long as there are huge profits to be made in mining, economies of scale will lead to centralization again. How exactly do you want to work around that continuously?
Then maybe you don't, because rational actors are unlikely to put their money into long-term hardware investments for mining a new POW, after the first generation of miners was *fired* when they became too professional/centralized.

This is methodically dubious at best. You're conflating two different meanings of *support*, which can be (a) *ready for it* and/or (b) *do want it*. Let me give you an example: The government announces a new tax that is to be collected after some date in the future and everyone is pretty sure it will happen. Tax software developers and accountants prepare for it so they can tell their customers this new thing is supported. That does not necessarily mean they support the tax politically and agree with its character. It's not necessarily a vote for it but may just be a reluctant "Yeah okay I'm ready, no choice anyways".
Bitcoin always held high standards for consensus and I feel the least a UASF depends on is an agreeable definition of economic majority and methodically sound survey, i.e. actually asking everyone the unambiguos question: *Do you want SWUASF?* Imagine a hypothetical entity BitcoinXY attempted to fork with ~27% hashrate support and *arguable* 70% economic support.

I agree and want to provide another way to look at the issue: Some people seem to claim governance is bad, Core doesn't have it at all, and the BU model is somewhat of a legacy authoritarian structure opposed to the fundamental nature of bitcoin. While I don't fancy BU particularly, this view appears rather naive.
The thing about governance is that it's always there as soon as multiple persons join in some endeavour. You cannot have non-governance. Even small anarchist groups (with a minimum of education) usually consider themselves self-governed as opposed to non-governed. It's futile to strive for non-governance because some form of governance is emerging anyways.
What actually happens when governance is disregarded, is that you end up with *implicit governance* which is characterized by personal relationships, inflexibility, dilution of responsibility and intransparency. As generally accepted in sociology, *explicit governance* is superior to that, as it is based on roles instead of persons, which are responsible and accountable for specific matters. As the structure of the group is well-defined it is open for change. An explicitly governed group is more transparent and accessible to the public.

There is no clear evidence so it's very much speculation. Being able to invent a narrative that matches statements about a current preference for EOM-only balance checking doesn't prove the narrative. It can be due to a variety of reasons, some of them perfectly legal, others shady but with full reserves. Until there is evidence either way I will default to assume proper operations.
I mean, what's the full story you propose? Bitfinex is one of the most profitable Bitcoin exchanges, at times they made over a million USD in fees on the BTCUSD pair alone each day. Anyways, they risk the future of their business and conspire to print a billion of fake USD to trade with and manipulate the markets. Then they manage to lose everything despite being professionals with insider information. So they start overnight borrowing a billion dollars each EOM since the beginning of 2017 in order to publish proof-of-balances over a year later?
This is pretty much a collage of the stories floating around. Needless to say I'm not convinced.

To be fair, I would assume in a dispute between a market maker with a thousand successful transactions and a freshly registered scam account, the arbitration might be over rather quickly.

3. The one-time balance check by FSS is unrelated to both of the above. It happened. Specifically for this one I have provided sources stating that the law firm chose the concrete date within a range from March to June (or later). Unless Bitfinex knew the date, which all involved parties deny, they could not have faked their balance by overnight borrowing once.

Generally I agree with what you're saying. Stock ownership is obviously concentrated among the rich and educated. However, for the american demographic, it doesn't follow that "ordinary people do not own stocks". One doesn't imply the other and in context that's worth pointing out.


I see bitcoin as basic infrastructure that many things will be built upon. As long as the core properties of the base-layer (which I personally hold in high regard) are not compromised, people shall be free to realize whatever their vision is. So while I appreciate caring about censorship-resistance, it is decidedly not a pre-condition to participate in a permissionless system.
Again, personally, there is no way I would buy into an ETF instead of holding my own keys, but people are different. Someone might know they were not holding actual BTC but still have plausible reasons to opt for an ETF. Reasons that may be similar to those held by people buying non-physical gold. I'm not promoting it as equal to actual ownership, but I am of the opinion we shouldn't disregard these decisions simply because they are not conforming to what we perceive as the spirit of bitcoin.

We're pretty much in agreement then, which doesn't surprise me considering how strongly you are upvoted in my RES.


This is worth expanding on. While I wholeheartedly approve of these examples of wealth redistribution, we may be fooling ourselves with a belief into this *as a principle* for a variety of reasons. Technically, during these sustained uptrends, wealth is redistributed from *late buyers* to *early buyers*. When the set of early buyers contains more regular people and less rich people than the set of late buyers, wealth is redistributed according to your narrative. However, we have no reliable data on the composition of these sets. I'd guess that your assumption was very likely correct for the majority of Bitcoin's existence, but it isn't fixed and could change in the future or have already done so.
We must account for strong selection bias when reviewing the examples you present. Many regular people got wealthy after they bought bitcoin early and they are eager to tell the world. At the same time many regular people lost money, too. They are just less likely to publish their story. Some kids paid for their education with bitcoin profits, others used their education funds to buy in at the top and they are not in a good place right now. On the other hand some of the elites bought in close to the bottom and may have dumped their coins onto the kids buying the top with credit card debt. Again, these actors are unlikely to announce their *positive results* around here.
I agree the wealth redistribution so far was most certainly a net positive, but it's hard to know for a fact and not guaranteed not to flip around by any means. If you got into the space primarily for this reason, you may realize at some point there's a "best before" sticker attached to it.

That's a bit like asking *"If almost nobody dies of polio, then why do we vaccinate everyone?"* and the answer is that almost nobody dies *exactly because everyone got vaccinated*. Bitcoin is stable and pretty much free of problems, because some of the world's most skillful and experienced developers are working hard to keep it that way. If we left Bitcoin as-is and stopped the maintenance and improvements, the situation would deteriorate rather quickly.


You don't need scientists working on more energy-efficient technology, while you can just consume more electricity.

The basis for solving this problem is multi-signature. For example, you can generate 3 keys of which any 2 are needed to sign a transaction and spend the funds. Average Joe can put one key into his bank vault as an emergency backup, keep the second on his phone, and leave the third to a "storage" service provider. For everyday payments Joe uses the key on his phone and authenticates against the service provider to co-sign his transactions.
This company cannot steal Joe's bitcoins as it only has one of the required two keys. And if they suddenly go out of business, Joe can still access the funds by getting his second key out of the bank vault. In case Joe's phone gets stolen, the thief cannot access the coins either, but Joe is able to retrieve them using the emergency key and the one stored with his service provider. I'm not aware of any retail app that supports this scheme yet, but business clients are already using this type of service.

Because you may want to pay for something *right now*. I like spending bitcoin because it's such a fluid process: Tap the mobile wallet icon, scan the QR code, glance over the payment request, done. In the ~7 seconds this takes I could barely *login* to Paypal. And I'll never have to deal with a blocked account or any of the crap the legacy payment processing industry is infamous for. Credit cards are a pain to use online. Just today I had a vendor debit my card twice for the same order. Annoying issues like this don't happen with bitcoin.
I'm not angered by what you say, but a little confused. Why would you prefer to type a 16 digit number, enter the expiry date, the CVV and your name to allow a counterparty debiting *whatever* from your card. Bitcoin is secure and paying just takes a few quick taps on your phone.

It's basically the same kind of futures trading that's offered by Okex and Bitmex. Their futures products are cash-settled, too, although your collateral is held in BTC instead of USD. In my understanding it is virtually impossible the CME could crash the bitcoin price as it doesn't allow naked shorting. In these futures markets there is a contract long for every contract short.
* When the futures are priced at a premium, traders will short futures and long spot to cash-and-carry until settlement.
* When the futures are priced at a discount, traders will want to long futures and short spot, but they really cannot do that in any meaningful way. They'd need to borrow actual bitcoins, which have a very limited supply and a high carrying cost.
I expect the futures to trade at a premium and arbitrage will push the spot price up. They might also trade at parity and not influence the spot price at all. If they ever trade at a discount, the possible down pressure on spot shouldn't be greater than it currently is. The only imaginable doom scenario is that a custodial holder of BTC, like one of the big exchanges, lends their customers' coins to a well-financed entity to short them. But that's probably illegal in most jurisdictions.

Essentially there is no difference.


Correct. Participants in the futures market bet against each other on the future price of bitcoin. For every bet "price will go up" there must be an equal sized bet "price will go down". As long as there is an equilibrium between bets in both directions, the futures trade at price parity to the bitcoin spot market and no real bitcoins change hands. But if more people are betting on "up" than "down", the price of the futures rises above the price of actual bitcoins and arbitrage kicks in (see my first post).


In this context the asset *is* the futures contract.

IANAL, but these are not the only options, you seem to be misunderstanding the situation. An *Abmahnung* (cease and desist) is an extrajudicial instrument, there is no court involved and you do not necessarily need legal representation. As the allegations are unfounded you can reply with a friendly variation of "gtfo" or ignore it altogether without paying anything.
OneCoin might still sue, but they could have done that in the first place anyways. There is no obligation to send an *Abmahnung* first. It's basically just a letter intended to save time and cost by avoiding judicial proceedings. And it's heavily misused to intimidate people with unfounded accusations, something the OneCoin scammers are infamous for.
I'd suggest the *coinspondent* does nothing and pays nothing. It's likely there will be no follow-up, especially after the article has been removed. Should OneCoin actually take this to court, he can come back for financial support and count on mine. It doesn't seem worth it, though, to pay for offensive action like a *Feststellungsklage* (application for declaratory judgement) at this point.

The opposite argument can be made as well: A single federal regulatory standard enables small businesses to enter the market nationwide at low compliance cost, which allows for a multitude of independent companies, competition and innovation. On the other hand, 50 different state-level regulations may lead to a market dominated by a handful of big corps, because they are the only ones who can afford the hordes of lawyers necessary to comply. A federal regulatory standard certainly looks like *less* bureaucracy from the perspective of a start-up.
With regards to decentralization we must consider the trade-offs here. Due to the cost of compliance a centralized regulatory standard might lead to an environment of "decentralized" businesses, while a decentralized regulation approach might lead to heavy corporate centralization.

No, it's not. Miners do work and prove it. Full stop. We don't need to care whether they are "honest" or "dishonest". That's the whole point of mining. For all we care they can signal S2X, S4X, S128X and XYZ simultaneously for the next five years while continuing to mine bitcoin and the network is perfectly fine. Still every miner adds to the security the same as before. Signalling is just a communications channel and while it may be confusing to receive fake messages, it's not threatening the reliability of the system in any way.

That's fine. We don't have an absolute measurement of consensus and we don't need one. By default the current rules have consensus, otherwise they wouldn't exist in the first place. To change the rules you need a new consensus that is hard or impossible to *prove* but easily *falsifiable*. Consensus for the B2X ruleset is disproven by the large amount of users, businesses and developers who actively object. Lacking a new consensus we stay with the current one. It's irrelevant whether B2X has 10% or 20% or even 60% support. All we need to observe is that there is no consensus.

Except that it didn't happen. BIP141 was activated by miner signalling before BIP148 had any effect at all on a technical level.

Segwit enforcing nodes (BIP148) went from 0% to *overwhelming* [8%]( in the past two months. And we have no idea about the share of economically important nodes. It doesn't seem particularly wise to drive full-speed through this kind of fog.

And it's not just a technical danger. If a significantly longer "legacy chain" gets re-orged into the BIP148 chain, Bitcoin has irrevocably lost its credibility for having an immutable ledger. It can happen after months of delay and unsuspecting users of the *official reference client* lose their coins. This is beyond reckless.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:13:25


So what you're saying is a minority of economically important nodes and a minority of hashrate can threaten the stability of the system by introducing a client that is more picky than the legacy one? What's stopping other people from doing the same thing then? Your whole argument is equally valid for a soft fork that doesn't relay blocks which contain certain transactions, i.e. blacklisting. It doesn't seem very mature to advocate this process of coercion-by-minority as such, just because you happen to like a specific proposal going that route.

@_date: 2017-06-03 22:36:08
Well, I agree with your implicit premise: Segwit has overwhelming support and miners shouldn't block it. They do block it though, so how do we deal with it? There are multiple options and we have to weigh their respective risks and benefits to find the most useful solution. BIP148 is a very dangerous attempt at a solution because it threatens the core value proposition of Bitcoin: Immutability. For a risk of this magnitude to be justified, *massive* benefits must be on the table. Getting segwit earlier isn't remotely enough.
In the long-term it doesn't really matter if scaling is solved a few years earlier or later and while I hate the current situation as much as you do, impatience is not a good reason to accept the BIP148 risks. Envision a future where the UASF has eventually been successful, but two weeks of "legacy" blocks were wiped out. Is getting segwit earlier really worth the media fallout about how people lost their bitcoins, the ledger not being immutable any more, parts of the userbase leaving for altcoins, etc.? Is this the way we ought to treat a project that's built to last decades, if not centuries, just because we're impatient and annoyed?
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:29:10
The UASF creates the *possibility* of coin loss for users of the stock core client. In the event of a minority-hashrate BIP148 fork, it will continue to follow the longest chain, which is the original non-segwit one. All post-split transactions on this chain will be wiped out if it ever re-orgs into the BIP148 chain, which is the stated goal of UASF proponents. The issue is neither about a hard fork nor market dilution, but loss of actual bitcoins as a result of the soft fork.
You shouldn't be posting statements like "UASF or bust" when you don't understand the implications of BIP148 in the first place.
Edit for See? This is the effect of propaganda like yours. People rally for UASF without an informed opinion and oblivious to the associated risks.

There is no majority by any available metric. 11% of nodes signal for BIP148, less than half of those are enforcing it. [Source]( One in twenty nodes enforcing UASF is not a majority. You don't change this fact by spamming reddit.
While 87% of polled entities are ready for or explicitly support segwit, only 20% do so for BIP148. [Source]( This is not a majority either. If you claim otherwise, you need to provide evidence instead of propaganda and religious reasoning.
Warning: Rant starts in 3, 2, 1...
Seriously. You are "*convinced [...] in spite of*" facts and label it an "*underdog effort*" because people sympathize with that. "*Everybody who understands Bitcoin [...] wants to see [UASF] succeed*" is an obviously false statement meant to debase anyone with a differing opinion. "*Long term holders are asking for futures markets*" to only "*buy more BIP148 coins and dump legacy [...] tokens*" is by any means not what sane people do when the outcome is undetermined. "*The only objection raised by knowledgable people is that they worry it won't succeed*" isn't actually the only objection, as trust in Bitcoin would be irrevocably damaged, if users of the official reference client on the "legacy" chain lose coins during a re-org to the BIP148 chain.
"*[G]enius software development [...] genius code [...] genius*". Here you're starting to sound like Donald Trump. Argument by repetition is a fallacy, you don't make things true by repeating how genius and magnificent you think they are. "*And real Bitcoin users know that Bitcoin dies*" is textbook propaganda, painting things black and white, imagining a vocal minority as the "real users" and everyone else is just a "fake user" by inference then? Sounds strangely familiar.
"*The support of this underdog effort will be revealed as the days draw near.*" Okay, there is zero evidence for what you claim, but a secret majority will be revealed on the day of reckoning and the BIP148 apostates will freak out and "*they will cower out of the way when it does come as the true supporters cheer*" and are elevated to heaven. What the serious fuck?
