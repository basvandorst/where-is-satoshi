Investors are less risk tolerant when interest rates are higher. Bitcoin is a very risky trade in terms of traditional finance. So my guess is that rising interest rates would be bad for Bitcoin prices if anything. I think the Fed raising rates last year was probably a contributing factor to the depth and duration of the bear market. 
However, Bitcoin is a non-correlated asset, so there's no reason to assume that it will react to rising rates exactly like the stock market does. This is especially true in a generally volatile and unpredictable financial environment.

Is it a coinbase/exchange account or a wallet you control?
If it's a wallet, 100% take those coins, they're yours and she doesn't deserve them. 
I would say the same thing if it's a coinbase account, but that's a little tricky because it's probably her email and legally hers with an organization to back that.

Do you really think that's the case? Pretty brilliant move on their part if you're right. Frankly, I'm just excited to see one of the most reputable financial publications in the world repeatedly mention bitcoin in any context. It shows me that big money is beginning to pay attention. Anyway, any press is good press right?

The stock market is so hot right now because the Fed has forced everyone out of bonds and into equities. Once rates start getting up there I think we'll see that money flowing back into fixed income instruments. But you're right, some investors looking for higher returns could move into crypto. We'll have to wait and see. In other words: hodl on.

If I had to guess, a rate hike will be bad for the Bitcoin price. Higher interest rates will cut back the supply of dollars, thus raising their price. The dollar will become relatively less inflationary, although not deflationary like Bitcoin.

The focus seems to be more on blockchain, but I don't see why someone couldn't put some application on top of bitcoin's blockchain to take advantage of its relatively strong network.

Precisely. A fully digital dollar is the final thing the Fed needs to accomplish managed hyper-inflation. 
Recession + monetization of national debt + theoretically limitless inflation = mass exodus from fiat.

One of the main rationales behind central banking was that it would take the ability to print money away from politicians who could manipulate the currency for political ends. 
Not that the banks are awesome or anything, but it will be interesting to see how a bunch of bureaucrats handle monetary policy.

Frankly, I don't have a clue what is going on with XT or the hard fork. I'm an investor who comes to THIS page for my Bitcoin-related news.
What I see here is a sincere attempt to limit the scope of discussion regarding this crucial issue.
I would like to continue to educate myself by viewing the discussions that occur here. The prospect of censorship is very worrisome because it ensures that potential participants in this technology do not have the reliable information that is necessary to adopt Bitcoin.
Please consider the effects censorship will have on new and casual users.

So you have the peak of the next cycle some time in 2020?
I always assume we won't set a new ATH until the halving, then go parabolic for about a year.

Anyone participating in transactions that require identification (e.g. Virtually the entire financial system). The normal people who haven't adopted Bitcoin because it is either too complicated or too sketchy, want this. Banks want this; it does their job with less friction, more cheaply because it's an automated, open-source version of what they already do. Governments want this; it's easier, cheaper, and faster to collect taxes whilst ensuring total AML compliance.
Crypto anarchists/libertarians, however, do not want this. And for them, there is Bitcoin.

Today I was looking at a logarithmic graph with the halvenings marked. It looks like bitcoin tends to hit about 2^5 of it's previous high each cycle. The last high was about $16,000 (average not peak) so if the pattern holds, it would put us around $525,000.
Your estimate of $250,000 is closer to 2^4 of the previous high. Do you think this is just a natural stabilization as the market grows?
Edit: here is the graph I mentioned
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:33:22
I agree. In 20 years, when the usage of blockchain in everyday life is axiomatic, $1T is a high probability. 
I guess my only concern is that much of it will move to private chains, where our only ability to reap the financial benefits of these improvements is via purchasing publicly traded stock. 
Even then, it seems quite likely private chains will interact with public ones for certain functions.

I wonder if the best way to think about bitcoin's inflation is CAGR over the lifetime of the asset. Not perfect, but better than extrapolating using current inflation rates.

From the article:
"Fidelity Chief Executive Officer Abigail Johnson has been a proponent of digital assets, setting her apart from many rivals. Under her leadership, the firm began mining Bitcoin in 2015. She’s betting the business, dubbed Fidelity Digital Assets, will appeal to Wall Street’s relatively nascent appetite for trading and safeguarding digital currencies."

In the 70s, Nixon brokered a deal with the oil exporting countries under which they would accept US dollars exclusively for their oil exports. In return, the US offered protection. Now any country importing oil needed to first sell their local currency for USD, then exchange the USD for oil. This process stimulates demand for USD via oil sales and artificially increases the value of the USD. Hence the term Petrodollar. 
Typically what happens next is the oil exporting countries (who just sold their precious oil for USD monopoly money) seek to invest their newly acquired USD. Where does one invest USD? The US of course. This is called Petrodollar recycling. 
So, US gives oil exporters monopoly money in exchange for a valuable natural resource, then they give the monopoly money right back in the form of the investments, further stimulating the American economy. 
Literally the biggest scam in history.

You were correct to call 2008 "one of the biggest" Con Jobs in history. It was only the second biggest in history. 
The biggest Con Job in history is the Petrodollar that underpins the entire global financial system.

There isn't some mysterious "other" out there called a capitalist. You and I exchanging goods and ideas freely without coercion are "capitalists". 
Capitalism gets a bad rap thanks to leftists propaganda. It's not so much a structured economic system and more the absence of a centrally planned structure. Less direction, more freedom. 
So, technically Bitcoin is a capitalist invention, but only because it was created by a free individual to add value to the lives of others. Look at how Bitcoin decentralized power, takes power from the violent monopolies and gives it to the people. Then ask yourself, "is capitalism really all bad?"
I think the the poster you're responding to is partially correct in that there will be a collapse that you need to prepare for. It will be a major inflationary event spanning years. So you can prepare by holding deflationary assets (e.g., gold, Bitcoin) that benefit from such an event.

Capitalism isn't the problem. Over-regulation by the state and manipulation of fiat currency by Central Banks is the problem. Those are literally the opposite of capitalism. 
Capitalism is merely a system of free enterprise where individuals transact voluntarily. Indeed, a much needed return to capitalism is the only way we avoid the dark ages 2.0.
