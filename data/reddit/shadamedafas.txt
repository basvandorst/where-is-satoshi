You asked "who's to say he doesn't need it?" not "who's to say he doesn't qualify for it under the current system?"

I like your posts. There needs to be a trading sub so that stuff like this doesn't get down voted by the purists.

Oh, fuck you. There are people that need that shit, asshole.

You seem to have a pretty solid understanding of how to read the charts. Happen to know of a few good resources one could go to to learn?

That's you? You, sir, are awesome.
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:21:35
You have officially 'made it rain' in this thread. I like your style, sir.

Seems you can get an Amazon gift card. You can buy most things on Amazon.

I'm with you, but different people find different things gross. The manner in which the objection was expressed was certainly rude, though.

What's the process for this? Do you need a verified account with mtgox? I've never performed a wire transfer before, and I'm entirely new to the idea of funding an exchange account.

What's the most convenient, but not necessarily the most cost-effective way to fund a MtGOX account?
