Prior to today, I'd never had reason to post to reddit in a professional capacity.

Infrastructure is presently several times previous capacity which was never overloaded previously.

EC2 is made out of hardware. :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:14:36
Which Android?

It's only for the non-logged-in and static content.  All dynamic content is served in realtime.

Of course.  But according to the blockchain, the cold storage is safe—as of this moment, right now.

Blockchain.info is responsible for those tags.

Yes, withdrawals are happening presently.

Sometimes I think about all of EC2 in this universe running in a simulation in a different one and how much RAM it must have to keep track of all of those electrons.

You missed one. :)

From the site: Trading will resume at 21:00 UTC January 9th.
That's about an hour from now.

PS: I love your username very much.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:13:52
Everyone with previous orders (which were all cancelled) were emailed prior to trading resumption, too.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:53:49
This is exactly what I meant to say, better than I said it. :)
Sorry for confusion.

Yup.  And ELB is fast (and multi-AZ redundant), too.  And there's a distributed caching CDN in front of that.

This is not a Pantera domain or email address.
Pantera's domain is panteracapital.com.
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:27:28
It doesn't look like it went out to the Pantera list - I received this at a different address than the one that Pantera has for me.
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:48:12
Another thread claims to have received it at a single-use address they used for their account on localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:46:26
There seem to be email-specific deposit addresses.
