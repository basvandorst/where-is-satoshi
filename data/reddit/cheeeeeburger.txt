Will do! I still think BTC is the way to go but need some cash now for a downpayment for a house :)

You could always mine other SHA-256 coins and exchange them for BTC. Just saying...
I played with the calc some more and you should get your initial USB miners investment (9.9 BTC) after [1.5 years]( Then it's pure profit after that but not much...like I said you can always mine other alt-coins to exchange for BTC ;)

Catch-22...only way to "replace the BTC you just spent" is to mine...without spending more fiat.

OP, could you provide source or information on building this exact setup?
I'm new to Bitcoin mining and would like a setup like this.

Could you hook up your bank account with CampBX like Coinbase? Or is it strictly money-order to fund your account.

I really want to get into mining BC and these USB miners are basically the easiest way for me to start but hearing that I'll won't make a ROI on the purchase fucking SUCKS!
Maybe I'll just buy some BC and hold them but it's won't be as fun as mining them yourselves! 
Do these USB miners really won't EVER make an ROI?!?

You can find these bad boys for .99 BTC now (group buys).
If you bought 10, (9.9 BTC), according to [this]( You should be making a ROI after 1 year. (9.62 BTC in a year)
This is if BTC price stays the same (which can be higher or lower) and I set difficulty increase to 30%/month.
You'll make ROI if you hold long enough and truly believe in BTC.
