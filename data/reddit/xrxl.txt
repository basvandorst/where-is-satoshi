Coinbase is currently producing ~60% of all bitcoin transactions
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:10:16
We know now that Coinbase produces around half of all bitcoin transactions. If they were to implement withdrawal batching and Segwit, block pressure would be a fraction of what it is now and fees would go way down for everyone, and Segwit use would go from 10% to ~60%. If blockchain.info also implemented Segwit we be over 80% Segwit use.
So no, we are not going to alter a fundamental security parameter (blocksize) just because two companies are incompetent.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:01:12
You and OP are both operating under the flawed assumption that having lots of transactions is somehow what makes a particular crypto valuable. This is backwards. When value increases, transaction volume increases because more people are moving to/from exchanges, as already explained. At the present moment, nobody really gives a shit about using crypto as a currency, they're in this game to get rich and you don't need many transactions to do that. This may change in the future if and when there is *massive* adoption of bitcoin i.e. hyperbitcoinization and price levels off and stabilizes at a high level.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:33:51


No it doesn't. What are you talking about? Using bitcoin as a currency at the time being isn't even a good idea. Why would you spend a massively appreciating asset? This is a meme from from 2013 that people are clamoring to spend bitcoin everywhere - no one really is. 99.999% of transactions are moving to/from exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:24:23
If you track the inputs back, it seems to be a lot of repeated coalescing/splitting of the same coins. I suppose exchange activity could look like this but I'm fairly skeptical.

Energy is the base currency of the universe. All value must eventually be rooted in energy, and all value on planet Earth derives from the Sun or terrestrial sources. The more direct mapping from human currency to these sources, the better. If bitcoin truly succeeds in the long term it will become value-equivalent with energy.

-blocksonly is still a full verifying node, which is a vastly different security proposition to SPV. And your real world bandwidth savings will be around 12% which is nice, but not really the game changer you seem to believe it is.

SegWitness? Oh, that's uh, damn. A way to increase transaction throughput that can be done without a hard fork? Hmm. Neat.

We could probably do it over the weekend!
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:42:05
Because you can't achieve an ouster of the core technical minds and a "governance" coup, weaken the network and make it vulnerable to attack, without a hardfork. The whole "blocksize debate" was just a smokescreen to provide impetus and justification for the hard fork.

So your characterization seems wrong. But since classic seems to care so much more about the users, I'm sure they will come up with a much better solution (along with the all-important hardfork). Can't wait to see their code!

Large miners have the incentive to make blocks as big as possible to increase the orphan rate for smaller, less well-connected miners. Giving them the power to do this with an effectively uncapped blocksize could be a disastrous move to even more mining centralization.
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:02:51
Growth at any cost and "low fees" have never been core value propositions of bitcoin. Without an endlessly inflationary coin, high fees will at some point in the future be absolutely necessary to support the security of the network. Space in a distributed ledger that is mass-distributed, trustlessly verified, and stored in perpetuity cannot come cheap, and there are no free lunches here. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant, or is intentionally spreading misinformation to suit their own agenda.
I do think that we need a little more time to build release valves such as Lightning into the system before moving toward a competitive fee market w/ a fixed (small) block size. Anything other than an extremely conservative approach to growth could cause lasting damage to the core bitcoin ethos of a censorship resistant, policy independent money.
@_date: 2016-01-29 05:50:18
According to my casual understanding of how bitcoin works, at anywhere near 80% the majority hashpower would just directly attack the minority chain, forking it into oblivion (if the proof of work is not quickly changed).
But, at less lopsided distributions, there is some amount of incentive to leave the majority coin. Whether or not it would be enough to stabilize the fork, I don't know and hope to not ever find out.

I think the supposed "fee event" would be a good test to see how the system works when in a terminal mode. We might as well go ahead and do it now. 1)

Casting my vote for segwit with 1 MB (or less) soft limit.

There is no reason to want to get rid of ASICs (not that you can really do that anyway) as they are good for security and ultimately, decentralization. The more complex the proof of work function, the more opportunities exist to find subtle optimizations that give some miners unfair advantages over others. Even with Bitcoin's simple PoW, the discovery and use of the covert asicboost optimization has had disastrous consequences for decentralization.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:40:52

It seems to me that the network is humming along quite well in spite of this onerous blocksize constraint. The transaction fees and confirmation times are still low, but miners are earning more and more in USD-denominated transaction fees per day, and the true demand for the network is being revealed. Hearn's doom and gloom scenarios have not come to pass. This to me, argues that a cap of some sort, maybe floating, if anything is *good* for the network. Which is basically all I care about.
@_date: 2016-02-06 21:40:21
The upside to the death of Moore's law is that programmers will have to create less-shitty software to remain competitive. Bloatware will die and be replaced by lean, machine-friendly alternatives since improving the throughput and efficiency of your system will become more about the software than the hardware.
Software tools and design will improve. We can finally put a bullet in the head of Java's twitching corpse, and come to terms with mark-and-sweep GC as a horribly failed experiment which should have never been used outside of scripting languages for lightweight tasks. Object oriented design and excess layers of abstraction will be strongly curtailed and used only where absolutely needed, or be replaced with more machine-friendly alternatives. I hope :)
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:00:44

If you pay the fee, it's not abuse. See? Easy. How do you get people to pay a fee? Constrain the block size. Preferably with a flexible cap, so miners can buy bigger blocks in times of high demand such that they will earn more total fees. This works better when the subsidy is low, and when we have better decentralization and on-chain scale than we have today.

Thanks for the correction. In that case, I guessed the incentive wrong, but I suppose you have some other (financial) reason to be so vehemently opposed to a fee market.

People have been saying this for years but the history of bitcoin has repeatedly shown them to be wrong. It seems massive supply shocks cannot be accurately be priced in even when known ahead of time, since the market doesn't "know" the elasticity of demand until the supply is actually restricted. It would be like being able to predict the prices of transferable machine guns going to $30k after the Hughes amendment was passed in 1986 and new supply went to zero. But maybe this will be different now that there are future markets and people are becoming more clued in that the demand for the asset is fairly inelastic.

Treating them as income doesn't make any sense to me. There are dozens of these forks and more in the future. Every time Joe Schmo decides to make a bitcoin fork, that would impose a taxable event on each and every bitcoin holder, and they would be forced to go through the laborious and risky process of splitting their coins and selling them so they can pay their taxes. That's nuts, and it won't happen.
Furthermore, these things don't even have a fair market value at the time of split because they haven't been traded yet. Suppose a coin splits on the last day of the year and briefly trades at some ridiculously high value due to limited liquidity, then crashing after New Year before you are able to sell it. I now owe some absurd amount of tax on money I never even had? Or even if you do sell it before the year ends, you couldn't write off more than 3k of the capital loss against your ordinary income IIUC.
I think the only sensible option here is to treat everything as cost basis zero, zero income, and you don't owe taxes until you actually sell the thing.

And an entity like an exchange that has access to lots of differently-sized UTXOs woudln't even need to include a change output in most cases if their coin selection was good.

Your assertion that lack of inflation will destroy the security of bitcoin is on very shaky ground and relies on several assumptions that are unlikely to hold true in bitcoin's distant non-inflationary future. I see no problems that cannot be *engineered* around.
Inflation schedule is not an engineering concern, it's an economic one. Changing inflation schedule is an economic fix for an engineering problem. Similar to increasing block size to "improve scalability".
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:50:29
I would argue that the massive volatility is a good thing. The ones who got burned and sold probably didn't understand bitcoin in the first place and they shouldn't have been buying it. They will write it off as a scam and move on with their lives, just like in 2014 and 2015. The price will continue to go down while we shed those people, but a certain percentage of people who got pulled in will "get it" and hold, which will cause price to stabilize at a higher level and sets the stage for the next cycle.

@_date: 2015-09-17 02:24:39
I disagree. My thoughts on the talk:
* He completely ignores the existence of (economically dependent) full nodes, an important check on the power of miners, which also happen to be disincentivized by large blocks
* He handwaves what happens when the block subsidy goes away, while subtly acknowledging that his math no longer works when that happens
* Implies that *2* mining pools running all of bitcoin would be an acceptable thing
The true main takeaway of the talk, for me, was the implication that IBLT are a bad idea, since they remove any existing pressure a miner might have to limit the size of their blocks.

I don't see much evidence to support your argument. Bitcoin has been becoming more centralized for years, yet we haven't seen any mass exodus to altcoins. Adoption has increased, if anything. The network effect seems plenty powerful enough to override any "natural" economic incentive towards decentralization.
I think it's much more likely that under an approach like Peter R.'s, decentralization will continue to erode, and by the time someone exploits that to attack or control the network people will be sitting around like boiled frogs wondering what happened, and it will be too late to do anything about it.

You didn't say anything worth responding to. Just the same tired noise with some italics sprinkled in. By the way, if you don't receive and validate your bitcoin transactions with your own full node on your own computer (unlikely), your opinions are quite literally null and void. But then you've already made it clear you're willing to prostrate yourself to the miners - good luck with that!

Going by your post history you seem to think we should ignore what the devs think is best and decide the technical details of the protocol (blocksize) via reddit popular opinion. I guess the voting would be the hashpower voting for segwit2x hard fork. Apologies if I got your position wrong.




...and miners should therefore decide the future of the protocol? Or are you implying something else here? The miners have the power to order transactions, that's about it


Ah ok got it, you're an altcoiner. Here in bitcoin we users actually do still have some power by running our own nodes and rejecting invalid blocks, though there have been several desperate attempts to erode that power over the past years (sound familiar?). By the way, if bitcoin becomes centralized and fails, it's game over for your altcoins as well as there will be nothing to save them from the same fate. It's bitcoin or nothing as far as I'm concerned.

And you seem to think the general public should vote on when to move the reactor control rods and how far, illustrating Szabo's argument perfectly while completely missing the point!

That's awesome man. Do you have Jihan's phone number? I'm gonna call and order a few thousand S9's right away and tell him "Dan" sent me. Also do know how I would go about saying "Fuck off, shithead" in Chinese? His english isn't as good as yours unfortunately

I think I'd rather lose my holdings altogether than transition to a new coin that starts off with the built-in cancer that is Ver and Wu's UTXO set

If this were true they would be funding core development. By and large they seem to not give a shit

I promise you that any forkcoin offered for exchange will instantly be sold into the ground. A recklessly forked coin dreamed up by a cabal of bankers and miners behind closed doors and developed by a single marginally competent dev is worth ~$0 to anyone who isn't a fucking retard. I have a feeling even the ancient ultrawhales may awaken from their slumber in such an event to make sure any ill-conceived fork meets a swift demise.

I'm afraid even just segwit activating might be enough to get Jihan double-tapped by his creditors due to loss of AB. He might be the first realworld casualty of the blockchain

Yep, one group is motivated by cypherpunk ethos to build a technology which can change the world, while the other seeks to personally enrich themselves by raping the earth as hard and as fast as they can. Put them together and you've got bitcoin!
