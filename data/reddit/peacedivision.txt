It is, only a small portion of people will benefit from it, those who saw the potential and made others buy their coins. Think about it, you can lose all your bitcoins and there is no trace, bitcoins will attract crime and i am sure in the future of bitcoins you can lose everything in a single click.

Just wait for it, you guys are so dumb... bitcoins works now cuz all idiots accept it and think they will get rich and some will get rich but in the long run bitcoin will die since hackers will keep an eye on the currency since it's too easy for them to put their hands on it. If someone puts their hands on your wallet with big chunks of money you are fucked and what about those people who die and their bitcoins gets frozen in their wallets. GG you stupid fucks !!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:41:37
You rich fuck, why would you have so much money ?
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:04:43
Money off money right ? it works when human labor is involved.
@_date: 2014-01-01 13:59:21
This is bullshit, money should be translated as "men labor" not some fucking generated coins online who nobody sweat and worked for it. The world is getting retarded. I know bitcoin would destroy banks in a way but till then we are very far.
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:49:41
No, send me 0.000000001 coins pls !
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:58:42
Honestly ? I think it's a scam, someone will figure out how to hack into the system and generate as many as bitcoins he wants or steal someone else's bitcoins. With no real tracking where the money goes you are fucked if this happens to you. Peace mother fuckers !!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:00:12
How the fuck you own so many coins you rich fuck ?
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:31:54
Human stupidity, people actually think they will get rich with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:34:54
You need to get fucked, son!
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:32:29
At least the bank gives you the money back. Got it fool ?
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:39:28
Fuck you, then you are those mother fucking guys who started it all. You probably sit on a big chunk of bitcoins and you laugh your ass off right now !
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:22:33
How stupid can you be to trust a coin that anyone can put their hands on it without trace ? God stupid fucking idiots you don't realize this coin is bullshit ?
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:26:06
Bitcoin is a "ponzi scheme". Maybe it can be used in the future but till now only early adopters benefited from it and if a hacker finds a backdoor in the system all your money will be gone in seconds. GG 
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:40:09
One more reason to not trust bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:42:05
Early adopters wants you to pay for their unrealistic price of their bitcoins who in real world is worth nothing. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:21:43
and how am i supposed to do that ? i don't have powerful pc 
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:10:17
Go ahead and kill youself you dumb fuck, why would you not give me at least 0.000001 of your bitcoins. That's what you pay for being greedy. HAHAHAA
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:39:36
Oh mathematically impossible ? That's fucking new ! How about the person who wrote the source code ? He just went off just like that ...now bitcoin is everywhere he just moved on with his life he just created bitcoin and left. LOL 
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:46:04
Just wait for it, till it collapses...if people all over the world would adopt bitcoin which will never happen, it will destroy banks and government taxes can't be payed. It sounds too good to be true. As for me i won't fall for this shit. I know what you do guys do here, you just lure in buyers to make your stupid coin more expensive, if you have no buyer you would suck.
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:01:48
Why the fuck a currency that is generated online is worth so much ? I imagine nerds who farmed the big chunks of bitcoins in the begining now are rich as fuck. How the fuck is that even possible ? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:40:02
Another level of stupidity, if someone knows you have bitcoins he will make you hand him the money with some fucking 2 phones and QR codes which will in fact simplify bitcoin theft. Thieves goes along with the technology not stay behind. The world is so retarded, if they buy drugs, illegal stuff with bitcoins they know how to take it from you also.
