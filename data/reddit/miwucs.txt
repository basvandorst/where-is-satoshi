Yeah pretty much. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin where they increased the block size to 8 megabytes. There were also plans to increase it to 2 megabytes for Bitcoin, but that was dropped. Increasing the block size only gets you so far though. To reach Visa level capacity, you would need blocks that are over one gig, which wouldn't work well. Hence layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. There might be other options, I think Ethereum is looking at "sharding", but I don't know two much about that.

In the introduction of the white paper, Satoshi mentions high fees of the conventional system: "The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-
reversible services."
It's implied that he proposes something that fixes this. So I'm with here. The point wasn't to have zero fees, but lower fees than banks/Visa.

No, increased delays and fees has nothing to do with miners being "underpowered". It's the way Bitcoin is designed: the difficulty gets adjusted so that one block gets created on average every ten minutes, and one block is at most 1 megabyte. So the network can only process 1 megabyte worth of transactions every 10 minutes. If there's more transactions waiting to be confirmed than they can fit, they'll choose those that pay higher fees. The other transactions will have to wait and hope they get included eventually. There are plans to hopefully solve this. That's what the lightning network is all about.

Yes they're still yours. It's a technical implementation detail, don't worry about it. It's like if you pay $2 with a $10 bill, you'll get back $8 in change. The Bitcoin transaction shows the $2 going to whoever you paid, and the $8 going back to you. Your wallet doesn't show the $8 because you don't care about it, you only care that you actually paid $2.
