I haved lived in Okinawa Japan, I'm not sure how I can prove it but I'll try. There is this thing called Okinawan soba that isn't found anywhere else in the world (even in mainland Japan) but shit, it is the most delicious thing ever. There is a place called pineapple park that let's you get a golf cart tour of a pineapple farm to the toon of a song in Japanese that sound like it belongs in a kids show. Okuma was the shit if you wanted to go camping. The 58 was the main rode that lead from tip to tip of the island. There is a ferris wheel on top of a mall called dragon palace that is one block away from the beach. The capital is called Naha. Is that enough to prove?

not bad. Thanks for the bits I'll do some reaserch of my own for a while and see if I'll invest my $100 into bitcoins, along with your 25 cents

Wow thanks kind stranger on the Internet. How much is 500 bits worth exactly?

The reason I just created this account I Becuse I didn't want to blow my cover on my main account. I didn't want someone like you looking at my account and discrediting my content because I'm just an "annoying little 14 year old." that is why I am using this throw away account. How ever I did not feel nessicary to announce and have to explain why this is a throw away. Why would I waste my time and other peoples time with this if it wasn't true? There are millions of things more entratianing then asking dumb questions about bitcoin pretending to be a kid who dosn't know about bitcoin. What fun is that? I am genuinely interested in investing my birthday money into bitcoins but want to know more.

So your main point is what exactly in a language I can understand?
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:48:48
Okay so is that a good thing or a bad thing? Or is it just something to look out for?

I think I already saw 20 minute video explaining the blocks and the bitcoin mining and complex mathematical codes involved in bitcoin, is that what the article explains?

So I could make purchase online without mom's credit card? Nice. I get what you are saying with the inflation and such but I don't get what you're point is. Are you saying the sooner you invest the better or what?

What if I want to use the money as bitcoins? Would things be more expensive? How do I know if a store near me accepts bitcoins? Would it be any difrent than using dollars?
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:42:47
Wait what do you mean here some to get you started?
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:04:16
Free bitcoins? Count me in!
@_date: 2014-05-13 16:06:09
Trust me, I may seem mature, but there is no way I am the slightest bit mature for any age.

I don't get it. How? I don't have a bitcoin address yet or anything. How am I suppose to have them?
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:40:32
What do you mean by cold paper wallet or cold storage? Is it something I hav to purchase?
