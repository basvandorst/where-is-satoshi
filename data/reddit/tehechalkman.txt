I live in canada and I see online poker commercials on TV, not to mention the online ads I see day after day.

I think that's just the provider. My cell company doesn't put restrictions on tethering with my iPhone except for any fees amounting from data overages. Then again, I live in canada and we have the pleasure of not having AT&amp;T in our market. THEN AGAIN, we already pay some of the most outrageous cell and internet bills in the industrialized world. So take that as you will.

The entire tech industry is one giant patent circlejerk.

I'm not sure what mind of "cult reaction" you got over at r/apple but people there are pretty level headed. I think the uncertainty over bit coin definitely has something to do with Apple having a finicky stance on it. Uncertainty meaning unclear appearances of government stances, and the unregulated and undeveloped nature of it. 
To bit coin enthusiasts it's a different story, but for a billion dollar company you have to assess what will be detrimental to your future. 
Tl;dr, not everyone at r/apple is a fanboy and YAY! Capitalism!

Westboro Baptist Church. And if you sold your bitcoins, why do you have a stake in whether Apple doesn't support Bitcoin?

True. I was definitely seriously considered the Nexus 5, but I'm really locked into the Apple ecosystem so I want with the iPhone 5S. But with apps like coinbits and coinjar, I'm not really hurting over the APParent lack of support. (Pun most definitely intended)
