**Fiat currencies** gain their value because people trust their governments, but the government prints money *as it sees fit* ("quantitative easing").
**Bitcoins** gain their value because people trust their blockchain, and the government can't print/create them.

I will again say: "naive." When a single entity can *literally create money out of nowhere*, it **doesn't matter** if the currency is debased… particularly when they are in control of the debasement. Solongas they retain real capital, it doesn't matter what the value of an inflationary didgeredoo is… **just make more of it**.
As a really-extreme example, Zimbabwe (maker of the 100TRILLION dollar banknote), is now stabilizing with citizens' use of cryptocurrencies… we're now seeing nation states **ban bitcoin** because it prevents them from creating currency out of nowhere (thereby **chipping away at the average citizens' net holdings / worth**).


Yeah, **it makes them rich**.


Sure, but why can't something like BTC (being a deflationary asset/moneysupply) **still** be used for transactions? I have worked many jobs *solely paid in bitcoin*, and have spent (and continue spending) it on purchases, **despite it being worth MORE EVERY WEEK**.
While I always advocate HODLing, I just can't see why deflation is bad in a controlled, functional digital medium.
AT THE VERY LEAST, THE FED IS WORRIED… definitely not today, but **remember how quickly the events of 2008 unfolded**: the investment banks (Lohman and Bear) **literally were clawed out by the other bloodthirsty bankers**. It was so-conspired… secret meetings to divvy up former powerhouse firms, where the ~~victims~~ former perpetrators' assets were divvied up amongst the lions.
It's a sad worldview, which I stay out of by occupying myself with high-skilled blue-collar tradework.

I will go one step further and say: **absolutely do not attempt to exchange BTC for cash / renumeration online**. 9/10 times you will never see payment… if it's a gift card most scammers will claim it was stolen, and then when you go to redeem said-gift-card you may be **arrested**.

But I've worked for a few *extremely well-off* clients — they usually have an entirely impractical sports car (usual a two-seater with 500+ horsepower and 2" ground clearance), and a daily driver to "keep the miles off" / abuse.  
This allows the owner to abuse each vehicle in its own special way =P

The one apprentice **I really appreciated** wrote me and said "I don't know how to use this so why don't you just take it back" [he ended up mailing me the paper wallet back, even though I told him I had a copy of it LOL].

My local credit union ([Provident]( - SF bay area) offers 2.01% on your CHECKING account, given that you spend $300.00 per month on their card. This only applies to the first 25k in the account, and you must have one ACH (e.g. direct deposit) per month. No other conditions apply.

PS My advice to DR's 17 year old caller would be this: if you're absolutely wanting to invest in your future at this young age, I'd take *up to* a quarter of your investable savings and put it into any one long-term strategy. So in his case, $500.00 of bitcoin. If it *truly explodes* at its current anticipations, it'll still be worth *quite a bit, then*. *Maybe* place another 25% *total* in a few Top 10 altcoins (e.g. Monero, Dash, Ripple, BitcoinCash, pure (*99.5% Au*) gold).

He casually mentioned in some clip I recently saw that it costs his current mining operations ~ "a little over a thousand dollars for each coin to generate — how much does it cost to print a dollar bill?"
Not sure that his argument has much to do with the inherent *VALUE* of something (i.e. (some) people accept cash as valuable… *most, in fact*), but that's nice to know a solid TIL about BTC.
There's an interesting graph that shows BTC's "actual network cost to process each transaction" (maybe from blockchain . org ?), and I suspect we're just now tipping in to the era/phase of Bitcoin where each origin block isn't massively taxing the value of everybody else's assets/BTC (i.e. it used to be that a $5 transaction cost the entire value of BTC worldwide more than 6x the intended amount [50 coin each block era]).

Your reasoning is highly-speculative (i.e. guesswork).  
While I no doubt agree that long term *we ain't seen NOTHIN' yet*…  
A correction is just around the corner.
Go to bitcoinity.org/markets, select "Bitfinex," sort by "2yr" on x-axis, and then click on the logarithmic scaler option (top left of graph when mouse hovers-over).
[Notice how long-term we are slowly climbing up and right]( but the blips seem to always work themselves out at the same overall growth slope.
Everything I've said above is also speculative.

I've been using bitcoin since late 2012, and it is essentially always the same. It's so interesting to note that when log'ed, the initial $32.00 (spike, many moons ago) isn't even visible. The other spikes (aside from $1200 one) are practically flat slopes at this point.
Unfortunately (go ahead and ban me mods I don't give a hoot - it's the truth) Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin very soon, and when that happens I suspect long-term growth will begin to flatten off.

Honestly, I'd go to a bank if you're dealing with a complete stranger **for any purchase** cash/BTC/check.
You may then watch the teller accept the buyer's cash (anonymously, minus the cameras) and then issue BTC-seller a cashier check immediately, thus avoiding the false cash dilemma... which has been happening!

**tl**; **dr**; don't sell family BTC, and thoroughly explain to friends that they can be left with entirely nothing (*just as with any fiat reserve*).
**PS** since this conversation, 385 -&gt; 673.00 $/BTC [which I bought @ $4/each in 2011] -- just going to throw another fire on the log, kick my feet back, and hope readjustment is for more than five bucks, each =D ... WOOHOO, that'd still be a 25% gain =D

You need to find a **lawyer**, friend. This is too much money to not handle correctly.
*Ya'll should look in to finding local sellers (if you're in one of the few markets that could support this) and sell off in say ~20 transactions of varying size/trust.*
