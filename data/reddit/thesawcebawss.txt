I'm not freaking out yet because it said I will get it within 11 days (I wasn't happy about that either) so with the holidays I'll give it a few more days. It's also my first deposit, I heard the first one takes longer??

Coinbase- and I get that coinbase sucks and all that but really whats a better choice for someone who doesn't know how to computer.

I'm not really looking to make "lot's" of money, I'm just trying to be able to make trades at times when I think it makes sense(see when it went up to 16*** a couple days ago)

I should also add that I am feeling like I want to withdraw my money as soon as I can get it back with any return. I am worried that access to the market is going to be a major issue moving forward. Its all too confusing and risky to go main stream.

So lets go 100 years in the future and all the bitcoins are mined and 10,000 people have all of them. What then?

Haha no. Like really, no. We can calculate value in things.

Im not as eloquent but I certainly agree with everything you said. Really just trying to talk myself out of buying the dip again. Im a poker player so I have a little gamble in me, but at least at poker I am a winning player. This game is no fun.

Well, that's my point, I think. If you do your homework you don't have to guess on other financial instruments.
