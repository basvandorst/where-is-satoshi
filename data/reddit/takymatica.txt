To access coins (without the use of a third party service) you must run the client on your computer (thereby running a node). Once the client if fully running (using your web browser) you connect to the local host and provide it with your privatekey which gains you access to the NXT network, blockchain, etc... 
for example once software is running use browser to connect to: 
So essentially its much different than ripple by a long stretch. It DOES have a blockchain, as far as I'm aware ripples consensus mechanism is NOT a blockchain. Furthermore to access the ripple network it seems to be that I must use their centralized (third-party) services at 
I will admit that at some point in the future it would be great to see more than 3 MGW servers

Seems to me like his concluding statement is advocating Bitcoin. Something about other people being in control of your money? Sounds like he just dissed the banks

*Here's a first: a decentralized crypto exchange. Bold claims I know. Its certainly seems to be a new concept that isn't anything like the current exchanges I'm aware of. These developments are truly quite interesting.*
From the link:
**What is MultiGateWay?**
Multigateway (MGW) is a third party service developed on top of the NXT network that allows you to move cryptocurrencies in and out of the NXT Asset Exchange, the peer-to-peer exchange that offers decentralized trading with no trading fees.
**How does MGW work?**
MGW creates a unique deposit address for your account, for each of the supported coins. When you send coins to that deposit address, MGW will deliver to your Nxt account the same quantity of coin assets to your NXT account. Coin assets can be traded in the NXT Asset Exchange like any other asset: you can buy them with NXT, sell them for NXT and send them to any other NXT user with the fast speed of the NXT network.
Similarly, MGW allows you to easily withdraw your coin assets back into your corresponding coin wallet, with the lowest withdrawal fee in the market – equivalent to the minimum transaction fee for the coin.
Every coin asset is equivalent to one coin. The coin assets are backed up by the coins deposited in MGW, stored by the three MGW servers in multiple multisignature accounts for every supported coin.
In a multisignature account, the same address has several associated private keys or signatures. This means the servers have to agree, each of them providing their signature, in order to process the coin transactions – similar way to a joint bank account. The use of multisignature accounts and independent servers is what makes MGW more secure than any traditional centralized exchange account.
**How can I use MGW?**
Multigateway is a service integrated in the SuperNET software. Multigateway is continuously being developed, and is currently in beta stage.
**Supported Coins:** Bitcoin, Litecloin, Bitcoindark, Dogecoin, Viacoin, Blackcoin, Darkcoin, Vericoin, Earthcoin, Maxcoin, Startcoin
*Looking deeper the integration with Coinomat provide exchange services with PerfectMoney, Ego Pay, OK Pay, and VISA/MASTERCARD. Ultimately this all happens within the NXT platform enabling the use of such services over a distributed network. To maintain nodes in the network many services require a very small fee, unfortunately this requires users to obtain a very small about of NXTcoins (from a centralized crypto exchange) to enable the aforementioned services.*
I'm newish here...mostly a lurker, hopefully my reddiquette is up to par ;)
Bottom line here, the NXT client is swiss army knife of crypto.

OpenBazaar isn't about drugs and other illicit activities ok!? It's about f*ckn free market economics alright.

NXT Asset Exchange combined with multigateway works rather well at the moment. Great UI too! Send your BTC to your mgwBTC address within the client and trade for NXT then Buy other assets like shortBTC or other coins within the mgw network.

From my experience it still takes 2-3 days to deposit/transfer money to my bank account. Doesn't matter wether it's PayPal, Circle, Coinbase, Amazon.. It's a limitation of the ACH banking system...and there's no way to circumvent that using a bank currently.

How is this the "first attempt" ? HIVE released a wallet months ago with 'waggle' which works great actually! Love their simple wallet. Personally the airbitz wallet is trying to do too much too fast. I like the concept of a yelp-like interface but it's much too busy for my liking at this point. No hard feelings just constructive criticism.
EDIT: I read that wrong.. It's your first attempt. Haha. Keep it up, heard you LTB podcast interview and love your spirit! 
Also, maybe there is a better way to do wallet recovery than 10 personal questions that can't be customizable? I don't know half of the answers to the suggested questions LOL. I'm tempted to just make up answers and keep them written down somewhere like a brain wallet
