This is my first job, can't expect much
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:40:09
Early retirement is a necessity for me :)
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:24:42
I don't have 5k. Started working a few weeks ago
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:53:18
Underrated suggestion
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:39:35
I've never attacked anyone, just asking why it's bad. I think I'll do the dca thing
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:32:06
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:06:03
So you suggest I should save up the money
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:04:55
Is 5k euros a big loan? Tell me more about the bakt thing, what's that about?
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:38:44
Ho creato un account su coin base, va bene lo stesso?
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:51:57
Yeah but what if the price increases?
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:32:41
I don't, but I can easily afford to pay back the loan
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:34:42
I should be able to pay it back, however, I believe I'll follow the dca strategy
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:51:33
Thank you for your wisdom

What's the difference of "gambling" with my own money
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:41:17
I still live with my parents so my expenses are next to none. I can afford spending 500 euros a month on btc. Is that good?
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:50:37
Is it a fraud in every country? Maybe it's legal in Italy lol
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:43:32
Why is that?  I would ask for 5k euros loan not fucking 70k lmao
@_date: 2019-08-19 06:37:27
This is how I understand it: buy and hold
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:02:59
I understand. This is a long term investment and unless there's a massive crash I should be fine, right?
@_date: 2019-08-19 10:08:49
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:14:21
Sounds good
