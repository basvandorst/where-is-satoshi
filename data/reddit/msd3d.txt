More posts and more exposure is a good thing. Even if it is a little annoying.

Oh man, 350 bucks I paid for the [voodoo 3dfx 3500]( TV tuner and video in was crazy technology!

Basic rule, spend what you can afford to lose, encrypt your wallet with a giant password, don't invest in currently available miners, and keep your tray table in the upright position during takeoff. It's a fun/scary trip to the moon friend, good luck.

I am a "break even-er" And still mine. I own a few BTC and hash happily at 90 GH/s and still at about 6 dollars profit a day for the last 7 months. I have been in the game since 2011 and have a petty good understanding of how the price fluctuations go. This is the calm stage with the uncertainty if it will still be a viable currency. My "Gut" prediction is that it will be in the 3k-6k (US$) range in 6 months~ So I will not sell.

If you have some bitcoin and some a-hole breaks in and steals your laptop/PC with your main storage wallet you are probably going to notice a computer is gone. The 64 key password will probably take some time to hack being the said a-hole even knows what the f* bitcoin is. In the mean time you restore your wallet (From an offsite USB) or whatever, transfer to an alternate wallet and change the encryption password.

Come on now, don't be a snarky Reddit snob. Obviously he wasn't the first. He is a new redditor check his profile. barely 2 weeks old. You should be a little kinder. Welcome to Reddit DolphinHeart.

This needs more up-votes! They got a [seizure]( order and then did not charge him with anything... Yet went through with the whole guns drawn kicking the door in an intimidation tactic to scare him and his family, and any BTC entrepreneur Who wants to be a part of a crypto currency business endeavor. This is bullshit! It's like me trading baseball cards and having the feds break down my door insisting I report my +-$.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:01:35
I don't know why this doesn't have more up votes, this is funny as Hell!

I myself was introduced by a friend very early on about Bitcoin, back when you could mine one BTC in a pool every 2-4 days, unfortunately for me I stopped at 9.35 BTC about 2 years ago. I have updated my wallet and am now worth 437 US dollars :) I will sit on them for some time and watch my 12 dollars spent in electricity grow.

Amen brother!

Like any anyone will tell you, If it's going to make you have to move back in to mom and dads if it crashes, don't do it. But if you live at home or have the extra money? Go for it! The latest DDOS attacks and the lack in value drop tell you a little something about the resilience and sheer Spartanism that is Bitcoin.

So this is only effecting the Dwolla us money transfer correct?
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:41:07
That. Or they are a big "Player" in the game and wanted to spread the word and/or wealth. Just a thought.

Yes, I have done this between 3 different PC's. Or you can find your wallet.dat file and drop it in several thumb drives like I do just to be safe. But I have a few more Bitcoins. Happy Mining :)

Dang, You can only get scones here. Crumpets sound delicious! 
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:21:26
That's 26k US current BTC price.... I would just die, be dead, kilt myself even. Poor guy.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:58:44
I just checked my 50BTC account and had 56btc, I only had .01 last I checked, I tried the payout and it said not enough bitcoins, then my real total appeared. That's 11k In USD, That would really help. But it's just a glitch.

I am 31, our first isp was Prodigy. We had a 14.4 external dial up modem on our 64 mb hd, IBM 386 . When we first logged on I noticed there was a game button on the sweet 16 bit windows 3.1, 12" brilliant 32 color display CRT monitor. Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, the rest is history. Thanks for the memory... Prodigy, I'm getting all nostalgic. But I agree, Bitcoin is here to stay because it is the next big thing. Happy mining.

I am into Bitcoin because I have been poor, don't like it, got a good job, got laid off, couldn't find another one, searched for an equivalent (Or one that paid more than unemployment) and didn't find one. Got re-hired and wish i had been mining for the last 2 1/2 years because I would be able to buy a house now. Hind sight is a bitch!
@_date: 2013-04-20 10:09:10
I like the huge transactions are, well, Huger? is that a word, I dunno. Just watched a 2000 BTC float by, 238,000 USD at current price. Crazy shits!

I have le work tomorrow so I have to got to bed. It would be nice to see another 40$ jump.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:30:48
We hit 87.70 folks! I am the proud owner of some damn spending money in BTC now.
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:44:48
Buy it in smaller amounts from various sources. If you drop a cool Mil in one go and your shit gets Stolen... You make a very happy little Chinese kid who spends his days key logging.
