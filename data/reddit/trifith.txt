If you don't control the keys, you don't control the bitcoin. By leaving your coin with a third party, you risk both the government and the third party stealing your coins. 
Of course if you do control the keys, you're the one who has to worry about safe storage.

The last halving happened in November 2012. The $250 spike was in April 2013. The $1100 spike was in November 2013. 
It wasn't priced in in advance.
The $1100 also wasn't entirely a lie, as the price took almost a year to come back down. There had to be some demand and uncertainty to keep it up that long.

Welcome to the club. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:50:27
I seem to remember the price doubling in the 6 months before the last halving, despite the largest ponzi scheme in bitcoin going belly up, then going up by a additional factor of 20 in the 6 months after the halving, followed by a crash to about 20 times the price of 6 months before the halving.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:19:04
The halving diminished supply, which drove up the price, which created hype, which drove up the price, until it peaked at 250 five months later. 
After the halving last time, the old all time high of $30 was breached in weeks.
Markets can run up on irrationality for a while. They'll correct eventually, but it can be pretty crazy for a while. 
5 months is pretty fast. Look at the dotcom bubble, and the run up before that popped. Or the housing bubble. Or any bubble, really. 
And yes, I count the 1100 bubble later, though I give fair credit for that one to Mt. Gox manipulation and the closing of SR1. It probably wouldn't have been nearly as large without those factors.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:06:53
I would imagine not bitcoin, since blockchain time is not super-accurate. I think there's an allowance for being 2 hours off in each block. A second won't matter.

@_date: 2015-12-23 04:11:33
A couple ways I can think of it happening.
* Days being destroyed is seen by the market as a sell indicator, so destroying days moves the value down.
* People value the older coins for novelty sake alone, so bid up older coins that haven't moved.

My biggest issue with all the data collection, is that the government can then get access to it, by sending a court order. 
The centralization is also a problem, in that non-state bad actors can breach the data store and learn everything too. But non-state actors have less ability to do direct harm. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:23:07
The point is that the coins can be authenticated, by tracing the transactions back to their source block. That way the blockchain can show a record that every address that spent those coins actually owned them.

A few alleged, but unproven, uncharged murder for hires that never actually killed anyone, that OpenBazaar wouldn't have, since there is nobody to order them. 
Of course, OpenBazaar is a decentralized market, so I suppose a killer for hire could use it to sell his services. But since anonymity is not built in to OpenBazaar, it seems like a dumb plan.

If I'm the only one scanning it, I don't need a QR code. I can just put the address in my address book. No need to carry it. Otherwise, how about so they can send me BTC?


Right, Sure. Do you trust the code of the electrum app? What about malware on your phone? It's a hot device. Once a key is on a hot device, it's not cold storage anymore.

Because bitcoins are non-reversible, and credit cards are reversible for up to 90 days, very, very few people are willing to take the risk of accepting credit cards for bitcoins.
If someone did, I would expect to pay a large (10-25%) premium for the option.
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:30:37


The reason to not include a QR code on the face of a credit card is that in order to make use of the QR code, somebody will need to take a photograph of the credit card. Having a photograph of the credit card face, they can read the credit card number. Having the credit card number, they can initiate a transaction against the credit card. The cardholder is then liable for the unauthorized transaction, up to the limits of the cards fraud protection. 
TL;DR Don't let people take pictures of your credit cards. QR codes on cards are dumb.

More like, the government has a monopoly on providing justice, and that is bad because monopolies lead to abuse. However, if I am in need of justice, there are no other options, so I'll use their service. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:24:00
Creating the public key is a standard part of wallet creation. You take a random 256 bit number (the private key) perform a one way mathematical operation on it, which gives you the public key. You then take a series of one way hashes of the public key, which gives you the address. 
Barring a major problem with the cryptography systems in use, you can then freely share the address (which is what this picture shows), and it is impossible to reconstruct the private key from the address. 
It should also be impossible to create the private key from the public key, but because there are fewer cryptographic steps between the public key and the private key, it is slightly more dangerous to share the public key. 
I am not aware of any instance where a public key has been used to reconstruct a private key that did not involve an improperly designed random number generator, but due to this possible risk, address re-use is discouraged.
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:50:06

Cold storage is compromised as soon as it is scanned to a hot device. It's now hot storage. Best practice is to sweep the address and destroy the key. If you want to return coins to cold storage, create a new cold storage address, with a new cold key. 
There are ways to do offline transaction signing so that you can remove coins from cold storage. Armory offers this feature. It takes two computers, one hot (online), one cold(never ever online), and a USB drive to travel between them. There was a tutorial posted on this sub a few weeks ago that goes over the details, or you can just google it.

1000 bits, @_date: 2014-10-09 16:51:11
The single biggest mistake Satoshi made was where he put the decimal place in the denomination of bitcoin. 
If he had put it where it belongs (two points up from the last digit tracked) making for 2,100,000,000,000,000.00 bitcoins, and a mining reward of 50,000,000.00 halving every four years, the psychology would have worked in favor of bitcoin adoption, and we wouldn't have this conversation every few months. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:04:31
Do you believe bitcoin will be successful long term? If so, it's still early. There will only ever by 21 million bitcoins, and there are already 7 billion people in the world. If you do the math, that's 0.003BTC/person at an even distribution. If you buy $50 (US) worth now, that's 0.090 btc, or enough for 30 people. A very good deal still IMHO

First, Nakamoto disappeared. If he returns and starts moving coins, the market will react quickly (price/purchasing power drop), and to use those coins will spread them around. Second, he has money, not capital goods, and money, no matter how valuable a unit is, is inert. As long as it sits there, it doesn't matter.
Personally, I think it far more likely that Nakamoto got hit by a bus or something equally sudden, and isn't coming back, which means those coins are lost, forever.

It depends on the vendor, and how they are taking bitcion. If they're taking via coinbase or bitpay, they should post a refund policy, as they never actually have bitcoin, and thus cannot refund them. If they take BTC directly, I would expect the bitcoin to be refunded directly. Some sites, especially sites that escrow for multiple vendors, offer an option to hedge the price, so that your refund is the same USD worth of bitcoin as it was at the time you purchased. This may be more or less.

To start, say there are 100 dollars total, and 100 people using them. The Central Bank issues 3% of the total dollar stock each year in new money (this is the feds targeted inflation rate). In year one, every person has a dollar. At the end of year one, the Central Bank issues 3 new dollars and spends them at the same price as the market had for when there were 100 dollars. As the year passes, prices increase, and a dollar is now worth the equivalent of $0.97 the year before. The central bank not only got $3 worth of 'free money', they also got to spend it before everybody adjusted their prices to the new money supply.

Okay, you have a encrypted key printed on your credit card. You also have a deposit address. You also have a credit card number. In order to safely use the deposit address you have to obscure both the key and the credit card without obscuring the deposit address. If you fail at this even once, the key you thought was cold is hot. Hot keys are more risky than cold keys. A credit card is small. It's going to be difficult to keep the storage cold, the credit card number unread, and still make any use of it for depositing. If your intent is for nobody else to deposit to that address anyway, you don't need the deposit address. If your intent is to keep the coins in cold storage, they shouldn't be on your person where they can be lost. Print out a boring old paper wallet and lock it up in your fire safe at home. Fancy storage options add too much risk to your storage method.

Unnecessary force, killing the criminal, destroying property. 


If this system is in place, it's the generally accepted investigation method. They may also be obligated by their own general liability or property protection insurance contracts to cooperate. 


If this system were in place, it would likely be difficult to conduct even the simplest business transactions without some kind of proof of liability protection. No renting property, purchasing internet or phone service, or any other kind of contract that exposes the other party to risk would be possible. Since this is a stateless society we're discussing, that would include road access, water supply and access to most 'public' places like parks. Failure to carry such coverage would be likely be viewed as displaying intent to commit crime.
If an uninsured person were accused of a crime, he could certainly purchase much more expensive coverage due to his 'preexisting condition'. Such coverage would likely include a clause refunding all or part of the extra premium in case of innocence.

Yes, your wallet doesn't have any bitcoins in it, it has the private keys that authorizes those coins to be spent. If you have a USB of the wallet, you have the coins.

I've heard this often. I've written multiple times on competitive justice organizations, with multiple people, and I'm tired of writing the same thing over and over. Far easier to link to the answer, and wait for further, specific questions. None of yours, prior to now, indicated you had either read, or considered, the idea. Now, onto your questions


As a victim, I would have the cost of ID protection provided, and had I been foolish enough to pay the extortion, I would be reimbursed. It would be paid for by the criminal in the end, though likely fronted via insurance (his general liability or my property/ID protection coverage), and the applicable premiums. Anyone would have the right to investigate it, and take action, under the understanding that if they act improperly, everyone has the right to investigate and take action against them for that improper action. This acts as a restraining influence on criminal behavior by those investigating and pursuing criminals. The investigation is most likely to be carried out by the person issuing my property/ID protection insurance since I am presumably the reporter as the victim, and then re-investigated by the criminals liability insurer before they make a payout.

Still an interesting problem to consider. 
The obvious solution to the problem of retrieving the key is a second QR code on a second piece of steel in a second box that looks like a BIP-38 encoded private key, but is in fact the password to the first. 
Now for the "remember what these boxes are and how to use them" problem, that's more complicated. Journaled instructions, at least clear ones, give away the whole thing, because any thief can read them as easily as you could. Unless you invented a private language as a child and can still speak it now, you can't trust any instructions written in cleartext. For the same reason, you can't hide those instructions separately with instructions on finding the instructions kept with the boxes (which you will likely have delivered at revival, assuming the cryo organization isn't corrupt). Perhaps making a habit now of repeating the instructions to yourself daily could help cement them in your mind in a way that makes them more recoverable in spite of the degradations of disease. That's no sure thing though. 
It comes down to trust. If you can trust the cryo org to not steal your coins, and to protect/deliver your property, a simple paper wallet is good enough. If you can't trust them, you won't get the coins (or even revived) in any case.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:45:21

It's an open source project, so the devs are those who contribute code to the project. 


I believe ~~Gavin Anderson~~ [Wladimir van der Laan]( is the current lead developer, in as much as there is a lead. Most open source project development groups are a meritocracy, where those who do the best work rise to the top of the heap.


All code changes are public (open source, remember), so you're welcome to look through the code to understand the changes they make.


We don't have to. We can read the code. We can take the word of the miners who run the code, and have real money on the line that the code does what it says. We can fork the project if the devs act in bad faith.


Supposing a grand conspiracy amongst the devs, yes, malicious code could be added to a release. However, getting all the miners and full nodes to switch over to that code would be very difficult, as the malicious change is likely to be caught by one of them, then shared in all the various bitcoin forums, like this one.
Edit: Corrections.

Agreed that picking randomly from a set of all possible statements will give a greater probability of selecting a false statement than selecting a true statement, but to reliably only select false statements you need to have a way of eliminating the true statements. This means you need to identify which statements are true (so they can be eliminated from the selection set), which is the same effort you need to make in order to only select the true statements.

In order for me to make a purchase with BTC over USD, the price difference for purchasing BTC must be great enough that I believe that I will be better off, or at least the same, purchasing this thing and repurchasing new coins over holding BTC. 
Since it takes time to move USD from my bank (where I can spend them now) to an exchange, I need to believe that when I get my USD to the exchange to repurchase BTC, the BTC price will be changed enough that I can acquire the same number of BTC as I spent on the discounted item. If I don't believe this, I will purchase the item at the higher USD price.
If the item is only purchasable with BTC, I will wait till I've moved USD to an exchange before I spend the newly purchased BTC.

Well, travel companies (airlines and such) would have an interest in wellness screening passengers before leaving areas with diseases, since locking sick and healthy people together in a metal tube for several hours/days/weeks is a good way to only have sick people when you let them out.
Public gathering spaces (stadiums, amusement parks, schools) could require a person carry some form of health insurance (check insurance card at ticket sales/enrollment), and the insurer could (and likely would) require vaccinations as part of the policy.
If there were an outbreak, various medical and insurance companies would have an interest in working together to contain and combat it. Dead patients don't pay, and sick ones cost insurance money. They wouldn't have the pre-built government coordination system in place, but we really don't know if that's the best system anyway.

It's good to prevent people from drinking and driving. It's bad to do so through the threat of violence. 
Preventing drinking and driving is actually not that hard. Saturation patrols for reckless drivers on nights where people are more prone to drinking and driving. When apprehended, remove them from the road for violating the terms of use of the road. Report them to their insurer. Their rates go up, and the insurer requires a breathalyzer to turn the car on. 
If they cause actual damage, hold them liable for it just as if they intentionally caused the damage. Drinking should not count as an excuse for poor choices, since the choice to drink was made sober and knowing that drinking causes poor choices.

The effects, however, are the same, if somewhat faster. The prices of goods, in terms of base units of money (the smallest existing unit of money) is instantly increased. An item that costs one base unit of money when the base unit is 1 satoshi, costs 1000 base units of money when the base unit is 1/1000 of a satoshi.

It would be possible, with the correct software, and a system that keeps the necessary wallet on a hot system. Such software has not been developed (go for it man!) and I, for one, would be extremely cautious about keeping funds in such a wallet, as it must remain on an internet connected system, so that the automatic payment can be made. Security minded users would thus have to make regular transfers to the auto-payment wallet, so it can send the auto payment, and at that point, you might as well pay directly.

Imagine if all the money in the world (whatever form it may take) were suddenly doubled. Everybody wakes up tomorrow and finds that where before they had $2, they now have $4. The effects would be that all prices double, just as quickly as everybody discovers it's universal. 
The problem with inflation in fiat is not that there is more units of money, but that one group of people gets access to those units before everyone else, and can use it before prices adjust to the real amount of money in circulation. 
If Bitcoin were altered such that a satoshi could be subdivided into 1000 pieces, it would be similar to the effect of suddenly multiplying the money balance of everyone, rather than the effect of new money being distributed unevenly. Prices would reflect the increase, as afterwards, and in a fully automatic manner, the price of a good that formerly cost 1 base unit of money costs 1000 new units of money. This would allow for greater granularity of prices, without actually affecting the wealth of the current holders.

It's not initiated violence. It's something they have contractually agreed to as part of the road service. 
If they don't stop, the penalties for breach of contract will be higher. Now they're trespassing (violating the road TOS) and engaging in outlaw behavior. Outlaws are outside the protections of the law. Whatever happens to them happens. Likely the pursuing officer will use some level of force to stop them. 


Market competition in the provision of justice services. The judge, police, prosecutor, and public defender don't all work for the same orginization.
Some things in a stateless society will likely turn out very similar. The costs will be lower (no war overhead, market efficiency in meeting demands), and the enforcement agent will be liable in the same way as a private citizen would. Excessive force results in lawsuits where the officer pays, not the town, not the state, but the individual officer. Contrast that with today's system where the city pays lawsuits for bad officers, and the officers get (often paid) admin leave.

In about July of this year, the block reward will drop from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. 
This means that the new coin supply the market demand is currently absorbing at a price of about 350-450 will be cut in half. Assuming no change in demand, the reduced supply will result in an increased price. 
I said November above, because that gives a bit of time for the market to fully adjust to the change. It's not a large and efficient enough market to adjust faster in my opinion.

My expectation is another bubble of similar style after the halving. Maybe a 3-6 month run-up, then something to pop it (weak handed early adopting whales is my guess), followed by a steady return to near the peak level.

How the hash rate changes is very much related to what the price does.

Others may feel the same. this gives him a chance to actually repay his debt some time before he dies. This IDEAL goal is unobtainable in current society, and I recognize that.

I expect that at some future point new ASICs will ship with a disk drive pre-loaded with the blockchain up to some set point, removing a large portion of the download requirements and frankly, disk space is cheap, so that's not an issue either. Non-miners don't need the whole blockchain.

Fact: People donate to cancer research even though their available budget for such donations is reduced by taxation.
Fact: People value cancer research because they want cancer cured.
Therefore, in the absence of taxation, people will continue to donate to cancer research, and, having a greater amount of money to spend on it, will likely donate more.
There are no studies on such and event, because such an event has not yet occurred. Hopefully, the coming collapse will be more of a quiet dwindling, as a new society grows within the collapsing US economy. Like say one based around sound money such as bitcoin.

Tor for physical goods? Paid in Bitcoin? Each node/agent knows the final destination, and selects a new node that is closer to the final destination than they are, but nobody can be sure if they are receiving from an original shipper, or from an intermediary. Nodes are paid when the final node confirms delivery out of a shipping fee the originator pays into escrow. 
Total shipping cost is divided among all nodes handling package. Each node confirms receipt and transfer in a blockchain-like system. This encourages nodes to select the most efficient next node.

Many early coins are just plain lost, because they were worthless. The early adopters who still have their coins are facing a huge incentive to spend/cash out. They're rich now for basically nothing. They will want to live the lifestyle their net worth allows for, and to reap the rewards of making good choices. The cash out of these early adopters is one of the causes of the big corrections, and distribute the coins to new adopters. A free market (which is not at all what we have in the current world) will gradually distribute wealth in a much more even manner. Give it time.

I don't think it's possible for there to be enough of it. As more "Intentionaly profit negitive" miners come online, for whatever reason, they raise the difficulty, and drive the profit seeking miners out due to decreased revenue. Eventualy, some parity level will be reached where the intentionaly profit negitive miners become profitable, if only because they're the only miners left operating. 
Now if they were deliberately using the highest cost electricity, and slowest hashing chips so as to maximize the funds they lost, then they don't matter, because they can't out compete the ASIC's and other more efficent operators. If they mearly don't care about the profit level, but are investing in high capacity efficent mineing rigs, you get my senario above.

Perhaps I'm using value too loosely, By real value, I mean purchasing power. This increased purchasing power is the result of higher demand for BTC as people flee the dollar and dollar based investments. By appearance of value I mean price changes not related to the purchasing power. If 1 BTC has the the purchasing/price power of $100, and the price changes to $1000 at the same time as the purchasing power of $1000 decreases to the prior purchasing power of $100, the price change appears to be an increase in value of $900, but this is false because the purchase power is unchanged.

B) Such seizure would be ineffective with bitcoins because of the non-physical nature of bitcoins, C) government banning of a thing makes it more valuable rather then less, and D) Total seizure/banning of any good is impossible because the government is incompetent. 
So the government can seize gold, within limits, which may (and depending on your purchase method/records, will) include the gold under your mattress. They mostly cannot seize your bitcoins, because they only exist in your mind (Brainwallet). An attempt to ban them would increase their value, rather than decrease it, and an underground economy would continue to function in the face of such a ban.

Options like localbitcoins (or a darknet equivalent) and silkroad will allow for some btc-fiat exchanges even in the US.

The better way is Pirateat40 repays his victims, and the fact that fraud is unprofitable because you end up having to repay the stolen money, deters others from engaging in fraud. Identifying the ideal is easy. Finding the path is hard. 
Why should US taxpayers eat anything? They didn't steal the BTC. Pirateat40 should pay his debts. This means Pirateat40 needs to find a way to earn BTC that is not criminal, and send them to those individuals who were defrauded. 
If the optimal scenario is impossible, that scenario is not optimal. The scenario I advocate is not impossible, it is dependent on a great many changes in the way society operates.

You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
It's possible, but I don't think it is likely. I don't think it fits with the stated goals and prior actions of DPR for him to engage in murder for hire. I'm perfectly willing to consider evidence, if you have any beyond the allegation presented by the state, who gains from DPR being painted as violent.

In general, no. It might cause some miners to hold their coins for higher prices, but if those prices don't materialize, expect some miners to stop mining. Price and difficulty will correlate over a long term outlook, but neither predicts the other in any known fashion.

If I don't need the cash, I can get USD and hold them in my Mt Gox account for later withdrawal when Mt Gox gets fixed. I don't need the cash from a FtF transaction either ATM, so if I'm going to sell at all, I want the Gox price.
I don't need the BTC faster than a Dwolla transaction from my bank, so I have no need to purchase at more than the CampBX/Bitstamp price. 
But I speak only for myself, and I don't need to trade.

I recommend purchasing a medic-alert type bracelet NOW while you are lucid, that indicates your wishes to be cryo-preserved, so that future caregivers can't say it's the ramblings of a senile patient. Also, Alcor allows you to use a life insurance payout to cover the preservation cost, so that may also be worth investigating. The same may apply to your preferred cryo organization. A pre-existing condition, such as Alzheimers, will make that more costly, but it might help.

DPR was specifically engaged in agorist revolutionary action, and promoting the kind of free society I desire to see brought about in what I believe to be an effective manner. 
Most other high-profile drug cases contain a much more believable allegation of violence, and I know of none with agoristic attachments. The allegations of murder for hire disturb me, but seem poorly founded to me. I look forward to seeing the defense offered.

If you invested $1000 in 1913 in gold you would receive 50 troy oz. Holding it till today (ignoring the [gold confiscation in 1933] ( you would still have 50 troy oz, with a market value today of $71,265.00 ($1428.3/oz). That's an annual growth of 4.36%. That's keeping it under your mattress. This doesn't take into account any collector value on a 100 year old gold coin.
The DOW was at 1786 in 1913, today it's at 14776, a gain of 2.13% annually. Your money is better off hiding under your mattress in gold.

So tired of seeing the same story. It's sad. Maybe, just maybe, there should be a security overhaul in the community.
All sites should require either 2-factor, or a dedicated withdrawal address, or preferably both. Sites that are not wallet holders (blockchain.info and other sites with a dedicated wallet file for each user) should not maintain a balance on inactive accounts. If an account is inactive for 30 days, the balance should be sent to the dedicated withdrawal address.

It takes less than a minute, but that is a whole minute for you to CALM DOWN and think about selling them first. Making things slightly inconvenient makes them less likely to be done. 
Want to stop smoking? Store your cigarettes in the room you use least, only take them out one at a time, and always smoke outside. The sheer inconvenience will make you less likely to go to all the trouble of smoking as often. The human brain is designed to be lazy. Hack the design to be more productive.

The results of about 5 minutes of thinking. Refute away.
1) Hedge against a falling value/bug in Bitcoin specifically, rather than crypto-currency in general.
2) LTC/BTC conversion is easy. BTC/USD conversion is hard. Depending on how regulation falls out, LTC/USD could end up easier than BTC/USD, allowing LTC to serve as an intermediary for BTC purchases.

A double spend attack is both technically difficult, and immoral. There are no shortage of technically competent, immoral people in this world, but the risk of encountering one in this kind of situation is lower than the risk of encountering somebody passing counterfeit bills, or using a stolen credit card that will have the charges reversed. build a small risk premium into your price, and hope for the best. 
Bitcoin is HARDER to fake than cash or credit cards, and merchants accept them.

If I'm reading the link right, he currently has nothing significant to pay restitution with. As for future income, it's kind of hard to earn money in prison. Which is part of why I think prison is a bad solution.
My stake in BTCST was a bit less than 5BTC at the collapse, through an insured pass through that I sold at above insurance value, so I have no surviving stake/loss for which to pursue a suit.
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:07:48
Yes, that is about the actual security. The *perceived* security by the average user however, is more like that of a physical wallet. After all, it has a password, so nobody can get at it, right?
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:30:29
Fairly easily?

BTCST was a ponzi scheme that collapsed about a year ago. Estimates are between 100,000 and 700,000 BTC were stolen. So yes, very difficult.

1)Debt forgiveness is a regular business practice, and getting even 10% back is better than getting 0% back. 
2) Stranger things have happened.
3) and 4) are hard. So is running a 700,000 BTC ponzi scheme. I'm sure he has some kind of skill he can put on the market, if the market believes he is trying to be honest. Which is what the third party validation is for. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 17:37:31
It's a big deal because real-world money has certain obvious security precautions that work. Bitcoins have obvious security precautions that don't work (User/password only authentication). The money in a Mt Gox account is less secure than the money in a physical wallet, because in order to take a physical wallet, the thief must interact with the victim in a direct manner, either picking pockets or mugging them. A simple piece of malware can steal all the money in a Mt Gox account while the thief is sleeping in his bed, in another country. It can even steal the money after the thief is dead and gone. Better default security is a must.

Performing honest work to repay his debt is some rehabilitation. Demonstrating that it's going to get him further to act honestly than it will to act criminally is rehabilitation. After all, once the debt is paid, he's free to go, with an improved job skill (whatever skill he used to earn the money needed to pay his debt). So now he knows how to make honest money, and that honest money pays better than crime, he's not going to be interested in crime.

Well, there's regulatory compliance, which is expensive. Then there's the tax incentives that lead to third party payment(pre-tax health insurance), which causes consumers to not shop around for the best prices on care. Then there's the licensing of doctors, which restricts supply. Then there's prescriptions, which restricts supply and availability of drugs. Then the insurance regulation which stifles small scale mutual aid setups for primary care. 
Yep, it is in part governments fault.
