Is there something I'm missing here? If you get 0.01201 BTC a day wouldn't that mean that you can earn about $2000 in 10 days? Seems profitable IMO.

I would believe if it goes below $5000 dollar its more than a correction. If that happens, BTC will take a long time before it will make ATH again. Anything above $5000 is nothing to be worried about. It can go down to $8500 and we would still be in profit the last month.

Yes, 13,7 million addresses contains 0-0.01 BTC. That's 55.62 % of all addresses. So I believe this is not a big issue, but there are some people that own a lot of BTC.

If you have 2.7 Bitcoin, you will still have 2.7 Bitcoin no matter what the dollar value is.

Well... Theoretically it could happen! :)

HODL has again and again proved it self to be the safe bet. Swingtrading or whatever you call it is pure gambling.

Because the rise in value we have seen isn't natural. The most important thing for bitcoin is that people start using it instead of keeping it. This is the only way bitcoin can have a future, and if nobody is using it the value will be very unstable. It will rise 100% when there is alot of PR (like the norwegian guy), and it will fall when there is litle PR. Before the norwegian guy the value was around $200. Whats has happened since this? Nothing extraordinary, except more chinese investors. The only natural value is around $200++ - my guess $220-$250.

The most important thing for bitcoin is that people will start using it. Will people use it or will stores start accepting it if the value is this unstable? Unlikely. Thats why if bitcoin is a stable value - maybe +20% value increase pr year - people will start using like any other money.

That is true, but remember that a rise in value we have seen the last month isn't very good for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:13:39
Yes, and the value of bitcoin will reflect this.

It could go down do $0 or it could go to the moon. Nobody knows.

Although I agree there needs to be a correction down to $220-$250 - a crash/bubble isn't whats happening. If it was a crash we would see less than $100. Rembember the price for bitcoin was around $120-$130 a month ago. 
My guess bitcoin will go down to $250 within 1 week. Then for a couple of weeks between $220-$280 before eventuelly it will rise to around $300-$400 and stabilize for a couple of months. Long term is still god, but short term is negative.
