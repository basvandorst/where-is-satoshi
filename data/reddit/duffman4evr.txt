If Gavin is convinced, I'm convinced. I don't run a full node right now, but I will to help get this thing resolved. You have my vote.

I think we are kidding ourselves a bit if we think the general population is going to go through with the cold storage paper wallet nonsense. I personally did it, but I also studied crypto a bit in college, so it was a bit of fun for me. 
In the end, people are going to have to trust 3rd parties to secure their bitcoins. I really think that web wallets will be the future here... which means that the law needs to play catch up. People don't want to put their money into a 3rd party's coffers unless the law protects that money for them to some degree. They need some sort of insurance/guarantee here.
I could also see a really nicely done hardware solution coming into play, but I'm not really sure what it would look like exactly, or if its actually even feasible.

Definitely, but the recent jump indicates something close to that. Seems like a very significant amount of hardware just lit up all at once.
Though this graph is likely approximated based on the block solve rate, so maybe its just a statistical anomaly?

What product is being advertised here?

Ok. Then use Gyft.
He gave the reason why its more of a pain to do it that way, and its perfectly valid reasoning. If it doesn't resonate with you, then you already have your solution.

Second this. Coinbase has worked for me so far (I'm in the US). Stay away from MtGox - withdrawals have had way too many issues.

Well said! 
I've been buying into bitcoin recently, but I'm not so naive to think that there is no possibility of the price tanking. I'm still a long-term believer in the tech, and a believer that bitcoin will beat all altcoins (the mindshare of smart crypto folks focusing just on bitcoin is overwhelming). 
However, lots of people are just holding right now. There is a bit of spending going on too (I've spent a bit myself for fun), but overall things seem a bit...on the edge. The ingredients are there for a crash. I just view it as an opportunity to buy cheap. I think that people that don't understand the tech and are just being greedy will probably lose out here over the next 10 years.

Seems like someone lit up a bunch of hardware right after the difficulty adjustment. Cheeky!
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:16:22
If perhaps they just very recently got the batch of hardware, and knew the difficulty adjustment was soon, it might be in their interest to hold off until the difficulty adjustment happened.

Right. Paying cash to buy something off of craigslist might have 0 fees, but you still had to drive over there (or have them drive to meet you). There are hidden costs everywhere. Comparing bitcoin to physical cash is an apples to oranges exercise.

This part:


Is there a motivational force behind the exchange of the first secrets? Alice giving Bob her first secret seems to only disadvantage her, right?
