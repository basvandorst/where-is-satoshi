And then crashed =)

I just suggested that to my dad today.
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:05:26
Go look at the overall price graph. It could drop to 4k without blinking 
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:26:15
Yup! 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:46:01
You da real hero here.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:20:45
I bought some earlier this year around $100. Not sure when I should sell because the premium is kinda crazy.

The owners of the fund have announced they will at a future point liquidate the bch and distribute the profit.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:44:18
Because I can use my Roth tbh. I have alot more in my Roth than I do sitting around in the bank.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:14:31
In which country?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:46:10
I bought 45 shares of GBTC at 50 and sadly sold ttwenty at 100.

You do realize that "no ID required" and " no phone call required" are two totally different things right?
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:28:06
If OP doesn't even want to call them because they want privacy, how do you think a lawsuit would go?
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:35:03
Wouldn't you rather do 2 than 3?
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:12:38
I made a pretty penny on the gbtc yoyo.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:15:48
Pron in the block-a-chain!
He said pron in the block-a-chain!
Marvin Zindler, I love BCash!
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:43:44
Can you link said theory pls?
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:10:17
Double shit.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:25:29
Demand in market terms is quantity demanded at a particular price. Demand at 4k is weaker than Supply at 4k RN.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:12:51
And the gold they used in the temple wasn't?
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:44:59
I sold mine yesterday and am waiting for a more reasonable Price to NAV ratio to buy back in.
Maybe at 1.3, but 1.2 would be better.
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:03:07
It really looks like your account is essentially a 2X sockpuppet. I don't know enough to say whether or not I support the NYA in its entirety but I don't want accounts with almost no history weighing in tbh.
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:42:19
So post something of substance and add to the dialogue.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:36:56
That's me and GBTC.
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:17:28
They have some good posters too. It's not like pro or anti 2X makes or breaks a person.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:15:58
Edit: which now exists
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:08:06
What's wrong with noob questions? We want BTC to be accessible for all hodlers.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:00:44
Is this a scenario that has happened before, or one that could happen? Are you attempting to fix the issues of miners mining empty blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:33:05
I don't think that it can be shown that the commentator meant "Bitmain purposely chose to hardfork BTC to create BCH." But I will say this...It's clear that Bitmain's motivation is profit. They will fork BTC if they think it will lead to profit. In fact, they could be crazy not to.
Whatever you want to say about the BTC core devs, AFAIK they are not compensated for working on the Bitcoin code. Maybe they are power hungry, as some claim. Maybe they ARE holding back Bitcoin's development. But I think the odds of them accidentally breaking Bitcoin are MUCH lower than a profit seeking company.

I meant on this sub but yes I understand the basics of the NYA. And this sub should get to choose to exclude accounts that don't really have a posting history beyond the 2X argument.
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:45:50
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:52:07
You can hire people to idea for you.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:02:43
Go to and you'll see the people who want 2X fyi.
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:07:31
Any idea where the fund will trade and under what symbol?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:55:25
Look at LTC one hour candle.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:59:13
I assume looking at signaling 2X support? Not sure.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:44:04
So why are you so active in the btc sub?
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:46:32
Slow clap.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:36:56
That's me and GBTC.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:56:52
I agree most traders don't. But there are others in it for the long term.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:50:42
While I agree that the recent price run up attracted many new buyers who didn't understand the technology I think it's wrong to assume that btc adoption has dried up due to a bear cycle.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:57:42
Yes I sold my last 15 shares today at about 1020 a pop. The price to NAV is out of control...a little bit over 200% now and I didn't want to get caught in a huge correction. If it was BTC I'd hodl it.
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:10:56
Because there's no serious tag...
Can I have all your bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:50:31
What rate is your 30 yr mortgage? How many more years to pay on it? Can you comfortably downsize? When do you plan on taking Social Security? Does your employer offer 401k matching? What's your career trajectory like at your job?
