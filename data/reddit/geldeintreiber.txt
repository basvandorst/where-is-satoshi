Yes. I created the topic in Bitcointalk.org. Antminer accidently helped an ongoing spam attack because it was / is mining 1 tx blocks. That made blocks with transaction only get mined every couple of hours or so. Leading to very full blocks and a 4000 tx big tx mem pool. It basically screwed all the APIs out there.

I have. I am no criminal. So this information is of no use for the government if they just want to use it to prevent crime. In my case any use case involving this kind of information is against me as a law abiding citizen. The risk that someone will use it to blackmail me is much too high for me to hand over any information to a central authority without much reluctance. US authorities have been shown to use information that they acquire in unlawful ways more then often enough.

I consider Mike Hearn a danger to Bitcoin too. But that is good. Bitcoin needs to evolve under permanent threat from centralists. That is what I call test-driven development.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:18:16
It is unconvenient, but bitcoin might become outlawed at some point. Then it will go to the underground. There it will thrive to unknown hights. Finally government and law-enforcement will accept, that it cannot fight bitcoin but is just blocking the non-criminal citizens from bitcoins benefits. They will then either allow bitcoin or they will be removed by the people. Money laundering will not be a crime anymore. We will understand, that it is not necessary to prevent money laundering to limit the number of commited crimes to a bearable level. Meanwhile the current system will hit hard on the bitcoin and even harder on its users. Be prepared to stay low for some time. In the end the bitcoin will prevail. To government I can only say: Hold still, then it will hurt less.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:48:28

Your bootlicking attitude towards these "moderators" is repelling. Bitcoin is about free speech and liberty of expression. What you are doing is against these ideas. You are publicly abasing yourself so that "the superiors" feel pity with you and lift the ban. You are even happy about the fact that they changed it to 21 days. The possibility of a ban is a problem. To protect against such a spam-action as yours it is sufficient to install anti-spam in the forums, such as a proof of burn for every comment. People like you on the other hand, that are bowing to this kind of rules, were the reason that the third reich was possible in the first place.
@_date: 2014-08-12 08:11:33
Bitcoin was always legal. It is not up to the government to declare Bitcoin legal. They are bound by the laws. They could only change the laws to make it illegal. The same holds for all other democracies around the globe. Declaring Bitcoin illegal goes along with banning free speech. Once it is done, the democracy is over.

Long story short: The German Government thinks that if a professional sells bitcoins, then after the EU law sales tax applies. This would kill Bitcoin in its usual form as a payment system in Germany. It is possible to withdraw from the taxation by using bitpay, because then the professional does not handle bitcoins himself. UK has different approach on same basis (EU guidlines), e.g. no sales tax applies. We will meet at the European Court of Justice.

Hi, I am Levin one of the co-founders.
The public seeds are currently transferred (encrypted transmission) to our servers and stored. We derive the pubkeys and addresses on the server. That means that we are able to see the same data as the user. We need this data in order to provide our services and features to come, such as e-mail notifications on incoming payments and so on.
If you delete your account, we immediately delete all data that we ever stored for your user instance.
We are currently working on a way to store the data in a way that reduces the amount of information that we can derive from the data e.g. encrypt the data on the client.
On the other hand we do not require any personal data from the users. Even the e-mail address can be fake if you want. We also have never access to any of the users funds.
Please feel free to ask further questions or speak your concerns and proposals on improvements.

A very bad and dangerous idea. Miners who do this will lose out in the end. Jeff Garzik is pointing them in the wrong direction. This kind of "centrally controlled" coin will be worthless in a couple of years / months. Then nobody is buying the coins that the miners who mine on this fork are generating.
The main problem is, that this proposal puts the wrong people in power to vote. It is as if Walmart and Albertson and Kroger were allowed to vote together what the minimum size of a super market would have to be for milk to be sold in. The customers will be the ones who suffer from such a cartel, as milk will become more expensive and it will be tempered with (as in "You don't get any milk, you have been seen on a demonstration as of last Sunday!").
The good thing is, that it kinda is the enduser who is in charge with Bitcoin. He will just refuse to buy this Anti-Bitcoin-Bitcoin-Fork when he realises what Jeff proposed. But until then it will be difficult to use the real Bitcoin and it will be in serious threat of a 50% attack.
Thank you Jeff Garzik for heavily pushing the "test driven development" of Bitcoin further with this very sophisticated attack.

Haha. First of all: He was busted because of his "credit card records". You see what your privacy is worth there. Secondly, he was arrested even though he used bitcoin. The majority of bitcoin users is actually against criminal (I was about to say illegal, but in the U.S. a lot is illegal that actually needn't be and a lot is legal, that should be illegal) usage. I am confident that crime can be fought even if the criminals use bitcoin. Crimes are commited in the real world. Bitcoin itself is not criminal but a tool used by criminals.

It really just comes to the fact that tax evasion with accounts in Switzerland seems to be much more difficult in the future. This will lead to an increased demand for Bitcoin. Discuss :)
Updated, 7:38 p.m. | Switzerland and the United States are close to announcing an agreement to end their long dispute over how to punish banks that helped Americans evade taxes, banking and government officials said on Wednesday.
“There is a deal,” said Anne Césard, a spokeswoman in Bern for the Swiss Federal Finance Department. “I’d say it would be a matter of days” before the two governments issue a joint statement, she added.
In a conference call with journalists on Wednesday, a senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said banks that had helped Americans evade taxes would be required to admit wrongdoing and pay penalties in exchange for deferred prosecution agreements, in addition to handing over information on account holders.
The final agreement will include penalty provisions “starting at 20 percent of the value of accounts starting in 2008,” she said. The penalties would increase for accounts opened after the Swiss bank UBS reached a deferred prosecution agreement in 2009, she added.
Another person briefed on the matter said the penalties could rise to as much as 50 percent of the value of the banks’ undeclared American accounts.
The total penalties, the Justice Department official added, would probably be “in the hundreds of millions, exceeding a billion dollars.”
United States officials will also gain access to information about transfers out of Swiss accounts by Americans who were alarmed by the UBS deal, “and we hope that will encourage additional tax evaders to take advantage” of a voluntary disclosure program conducted by the Internal Revenue Service, she said. That program has already netted more than $5 billion as 38,000 tax evaders came clean with the government, she said.
The official said that 14 Swiss banks under investigation by the United States would not be eligible to participate in the new deal but that they would benefit by having a framework for turning over information. The official declined to identify the banks.
One Swiss bank, Zurich Cantonal Bank, confirmed on Wednesday that the impending settlement covered only those Swiss banks not under formal investigation by United States authorities. The banks, including Zurich Cantonal, that are under investigation are cooperating directly with the Justice Department, Igor Moser, a bank spokesman, said in a statement by e-mail. He said his bank welcomed the agreement “because it is a precondition for Zurich Cantonal Bank to enter into negotiations” for a deferred prosecution agreement.
“The banks are backing the program,” said Sindy Schmiegel Werner, a spokeswoman in Basel for the Swiss Bankers’ Association. “It’s a painful thing,” she said, “but it’s the most acceptable solution among a number of unacceptable solutions.”
Switzerland, home to accounts with more than $2 trillion in overseas deposits, has been locked in thorny negotiations with Washington since 2009, when UBS, the largest Swiss bank, agreed to pay a $780 million fine and to hand over information on 4,450 accounts to resolve accusations that it had helped wealthy American clients avoid taxes.
When the Swiss balked at American demands for information from additional banks, Washington began criminal investigations into more institutions, including Credit Suisse and Julius Baer. In February 2012, the United States sent an unmistakable message about its determination by indicting Wegelin &amp; Company, the oldest Swiss bank, putting it out of business.
A previous attempt by the Swiss government to arrange a deal failed in June of this year, when Parliament balked, reflecting concerns about privacy and complaints that the agreement was being negotiated in secret. Legislators then called on Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss finance minister and president of the Federal Council, the panel that serves as the Swiss collective head of state, to work out an executive-level agreement with Washington.
On Wednesday, the Federal Council said in a statement that it had “instructed the Federal Department of Finance to conclude the corresponding work.”
“The signing of the joint statement should enable Swiss banks to resolve the tax dispute with the United States within the scope of existing legislation,” it added. “The dispute has put a strain on relations between the two countries in the past.”
The United States has increased the legal pressure on Switzerland in recent years, indicting dozens of Swiss bankers, lawyers and advisers over their roles in aiding offshore tax evasion by wealthy Americans.
“The pressure on the Swiss has been extreme, and they’re looking for anything they can do,” said Jack Blum, a Washington lawyer and an offshore banking expert.
Ms. Schmiegel said that under the proposed agreement, the council would grant Swiss lenders the “exceptional permission” to give Washington the information it wants on bank employees, accounts and business activities.
Requests for client information would still be handled through the “administrative assistance” provision of the double-taxation treaty between the two countries. The revised treaty has been ratified by the Swiss Parliament but has been stalled in Washington, where Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has argued that it would give the Internal Revenue Service too much power and violate Americans’ right to privacy.
A deal would not mean an end to Swiss banking secrecy because it would affect only the accounts of Americans, but it would represent a continuing erosion of the once-ironclad Swiss guarantee that banking information was sacrosanct.
Switzerland is working separately on a tax deal with the European Union, of which it is not a member. And it has agreed to cooperate with the United States on the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, a wide-reaching United States initiative to find American assets hidden overseas.

Use a netbook that has never been online. Even better with a fresh OS install. Install Armory and create a new wallet. Print out the backup. Copy a "Read only copy" on a usb stick. You could now permanently delete the wallet from the offline computer to ensure you never again have access to the funds on the wallet. Connect the USB key to another system with internetaccess and Armory on it. Import the read only copy. Generate an address and send the coins you wanna donate to the address. Give the printed out wallet backup in sealed envelope to your friend. Remember that the person has only one backup. If he loses the envelope, he loses all the coins. Maybe give him a couple of the same sheets or tell him to make a copy himself and store them savely.

Thanks for the support, but I think you misunderstood. I think bitcoins have immense value. Until you hand over the private key to spend the coins to some third party.

The relation to bitcoin: This agreement will end the common practice of American citizens to store unreported income in Switzerland. All the people who have illicit earnings in Switzerland will have to move it out quickly. Some of them might and will turn to bitcoin. This will lead to a price rise.

I added the Bitcoin signs myself, so yes kinda fake. I hope you figured that out by yourself and did not really think I was claming the Euro banknotes are plastered with hidden bitcoin symbols these days...

Correct, there is no mention of Bitcoin whatsoever in the article. Am I forbidden from stating my conclusions? Is it too much to assume that people on this subreddit are able to read?

I think Coinbase is rat poison and am from Europe. Screenshot would be much appreciated.

This is illegal. They will get prosecuted for money laundering and that for good reasons. Any drug dealer would be able to get his bitcoins a) in the regular system and b) avoid paying taxes on his illicit income. No business can provide this without interfering with european laws.

If you buy a house with cash you will get investigated by the police as well. This is good practice and you are VERY naive to think that you can cash out on bitcoin without being ready to prove where the money came from. Your profit might be subject to taxation as well btw.

The saddest thing ist, that the thief will probably not understand the value he has gotten within your desktop and simply delete your private keys. Deflation deflation. Sorry for your loss though but running around without a backup for your private keys is mental.

Researchers showed a very hypothetical attack scheme that would increase their part of newly mined bitcoin by a tiny bit. Media is too dumb to understand anything and boasts the bitcoin was doomed. The bitcoin never has been better. Even if the attack was done the damage would be very low and ONLY for miners. "Everything is fine, there is nothing to see, carry on."

Yes. Updating to 0.8.5 works like a charm. 0.8.5 is THE recent version, btw. There are not several recent versions. If there is a new version, the currently recent version becomes the old.

Hey James, that's correct. They said they are compliant with the regulators and are negotiating weither they need a license or not.
A "Geldeintreiber" is a person who is working for some kind of shady business as a brothel or a construction company. It is "the guy" who makes the debtors of these businesses pay their debt (maybe even invented debts) by threatening them with violance or alike. The name is a kind of joke actually.

Thank you for this valuable feedback. Would have appreciated the comment inside the blog as well, but whatever. The intention was to emphasize the aspect of bitcoin as a means of transaction. Maybe there will be another one with the aspect of investment. Also: Feel free to make another version yourself. Where are you based? As for the mentioning of our "Stammtisch" (for English readers: rather old-school German word for Meetup): It is on the LAST page (as the image shows the outside of the flyer).

"Add the keyword "verify" at the end only if you want to make the bot reply to the tip with a verification. If you don't include "verify", both you and the tippee will get private messages instead."
Verification is actually a kind of spam and unnecessary.

Make your own cards with private keys generated by yourself on a private system. This is an okay solution. Trusting anyone to "delete the private keys" is mental.
