I've been talking about this idea with people for a while now. We need it. Ethereum has code on their website that you can use to "build a democracy on the blockchain".

Why not just use the land and build a mining farm? You then keep the land and then have it making money and getting into crypto at the same time.

Are you on drugs? You really don't seem to understand bitcoin or the fractional reserve banking system we currently employ. It's entirely possible, plausible, and in my opinion inevitable that our current dollar system may collapse. Unless you want to just disregard history completely.

Do you think a country has to be a "global power" to have an economy and be an example of the dollar failing LMAO. No it doesn't. Explain WHY, you have the opinion that an economy based on dollars can not fail. We'll all wait for that one, is it because they can print money? LOL

One thing to keep in mind if your bitcoin is not in an actual wallet, where you control the seed phrase then you're not in direct control of that btc. As far as i know the cash app doesn't make you create that but that's only what i've heard. This is important if you want to get a lot of bitcoin or want to store it securely. I think its great that cash app is offering "bitcoin" but I just don't think its the same as actually controlling the coins.

You can get a Shift card through Coinbase for $10 worth of btc and that will allow you to spend your crypto directly as if you were using a debit card. You can select any account that has crypto from your coinbase account. The Shift card is a visa card and can be used anywhere visa is accepted.

Right, I see that phrase in your post. But whatever you're trying to say doesn't make sense. 5 programmers? Who are they? Sharing their bitcoin? How, why, to who? What do you mean? This post is just a jumble of words to me.

Overstock takes bitcoin directly and you could order about anything on there. As for physical stores though, we do need more adoption in that area.

It is, you have to spend crypto to get it too, then if you don't use it they just shut it off and you lost that money you spent to get the card. Fuck coinbase.

Two things for safety and security.
1. Don't tell people your exact BTC amount
2. If you don't have the private keys, just like everyone is saying, you don't actually own that bitcoin. "Not your keys, not your coin".
(My personal opinion, i would say learn about crypto wallets and when you are ready, get on an exchange, sell what you have on robinhood, then buy that amount on the exchange and transfer your coins to a hardware or good software wallet. Then you will be in full control of your coins.)
Still, congrats!

I've recently looked into BISQ and its idea is truly amazing, and they seem to actually stand for what cryptocurrencies are supposed to be. I hope we all start using this soon. I think anyone who believes in cryptocurrencies should be using an exchange like BISQ.

He's not done his homework on bitcoin. I think it's silly he sounds like he's based his opinion on weather or not his portfolio managers are dealing with crypto, but they might not understand it either or be told by their companies that they shouldn't work with it as that's been the norm for a while now but is changing slowly. Dudes crazy if he really thinks there's no need for Bitcoin.

Assuming all merchants co-operated with providing info it would be relatively easy to keep track of names and street addresses associated with a bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:14:20
Boycotting sounds like a good idea. My question though is how they plan to implement something like this. Bitcoin is decentralized, they can't just add some random feature if people don't adopt it. So I think never making a crypto purchase with them is a good idea at least for now. To track people I would imagine they would have to just start making lists after a purchase and keep that information. But then someone could just change their wallet... So even though they have a patent i'm not sure how this would work on a large scale.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:04:01
Some states in the US like Michigan say they require anything sold for bitcoin to immediately be transferred to fiat after the sale if you are a business. I don't see how they would enforce this though and I don't think I would do that. However, to show income in the business you would have to exchange them probably so it could be taxed revenue.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:20:06
To put it very simply, not your private keys, not your coins. A site like Coinbase, if they have any of your crypto on there have the actual full control over your coins and account that's on the exchange. This is because they have the private keys to the wallet they are storing your coins in. Worst case scenario if the site was hacked, or if they just said FU to everyone you would be screwed. Look up Mt. Gox to get an idea of what can happen if an exchange is compromised.

For mobile at the moment I am using Eclair, it has lightning network support but haven't tried it yet. At home I would recommend having a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s. You setup your own wallet linked to and protected by hardware security. Just make sure your seed phrases and passwords are safe somewhere separate from your hardware.

@_date: 2018-12-05 17:25:48
For sure! Its actually really important to understand about exchanges because it's not necessarily something they want to explain to you as a customer. They would rather have all your coins in their wallet and be in control. When the point of bitcoin is for you, the user to have control of your own currency.
