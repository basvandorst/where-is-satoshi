Price reduced, also was able to catch purchase that looks to be fraudulent.
@_date: 2011-09-06 20:25:29
I totally understand, the price will be adjusted over time to a level were people want to use the service.
@_date: 2011-11-09 21:43:29
sounds good, any previews?
@_date: 2011-09-07 00:38:34
Price reduced to 8.40

I haven't had any chargebacks yet, I haven't had a payout yet though. Also I have cancelled half of my purchases due a mismatch of checkout and FB. They pass all of Checkouts risk checks though. =\

@_date: 2011-11-14 19:16:19
Yeah, they had all my financial info.
@_date: 2011-09-06 20:56:31
Valid point.
@_date: 2011-09-07 03:00:13
I am currently verifying each transaction. I plan to automate a majority of the process to save on time. If you could link me to the "chargeback guarantee callback" I would appreciate it.

The second purchase was attempted with what looks to be a phished google checkout account. The facebook account used was an entirely different person. I wouldn't have caught it without having the facebook info.
So within 2 transactions the process I have put in place has done what I wanted it to do.
My logic is this...
I accept google checkout for a digital good. This is not covered under googles chargeback policy. So if there is a chargeback I am out the money. BTC as we all know is none reversible so I have to protect myself. To protect myself I am requiring two independent security teams to verify your information. If they match up then we are good to go.
This definitely is downside to my system. No one wants to give up anymore information then they have to. Especially personal information. I sympathise with this completely, but I am not willing to take the monetary risk.

This was a brand new checkout account, I had been running for 3 months no charge backs on my first account. I had to switch to have a proper payout schedule my first account was associated with the android market. Google recommend i start a new account to get the proper payout schedule.
@_date: 2011-09-28 20:17:18
keep me updated.
@_date: 2011-09-14 18:00:26
This seems like the Chicken or the Egg senario. 
@_date: 2011-09-07 04:44:25
Lets try this again. You authenticate twice, first to facebook, second to google. If your information matches both accounts and both are defined as verified via each provider then I process the transaction. The other piece I personally verify is how old the checkout account is and how long ago the facebook info has edited.

Chargebacks are fought on behalf of google, they will request more info if the need it. I plan to provide block explorer data to support the process of the transaction.
I also cross reference Facebook connect data with google checkout before processing the transaction. If they match and the profiles have been around for more then a couple months then I will process it.
@_date: 2011-09-15 18:08:29
 for google checkout. Lowest price of the google checkout options.
@_date: 2011-09-07 06:13:10
I stated I have access to when the facebook info was last updated. So if it was updated recently then I dont approve the transaction. AKA if you change your name in the last month I will know it.

I assure you Accesscoin is not a scam. I recommend you check his comment history.
@_date: 2011-09-09 20:21:39
current rate is 5.41, I base rate of exchangebitcoins.com + my fee
@_date: 2011-09-06 20:40:21
The current reason for the fee is to protect myself against possible chargebacks. I am pretty confident I can avoid these with the system I have setup. But for now I need to be able to cover a loss. I will also be working to automate the approval process to speed up transactions.
@_date: 2011-11-14 19:18:27
Google refunded all the transactions back to the customers. They expect me to reconcile with them individually. 
@_date: 2011-09-07 03:05:08
This is just two factor authentication. I am using both facebook and checkout to verify who you say you are.  
@_date: 2011-09-06 22:31:35
codewebs, this glitch has been fixed. Sorry for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2011-09-28 16:45:04
Did the chargeback occur after you got a payout? How long after the transaction did the charge back accure? 
@_date: 2011-11-02 15:11:36
My account does not have a Payout Limit. Thanks for the feedback though.
@_date: 2011-10-03 17:39:22
Hows the chargeback process going?
@_date: 2011-11-14 17:13:03
It is one thing to say its against policy and to stop the service. It is another thing to steal someones funds. Especially when a Google employ stated it was ok on there own forums. I will update on what happens. Also do you know the name of this crypto currency?
@_date: 2011-09-16 18:07:51
Cross referencing them with the Facebook info. It takes much longer and is currently keeps me up at night with orders, but it works. Account age and location etc are a few of the pieces I match up.
@_date: 2011-09-16 18:01:43
 hasn't had that issue yet. It think it's because I personally cancel about 65% of the orders because they are fraudulent. That is with Google fraud protection claiming they are legit as well. So I have a feeling you are just getting to many risky orders.
@_date: 2011-09-07 05:57:28
moved current price to front page.
@_date: 2011-10-04 15:19:25
Thanks for all the PMs, I was able to line someone up. Thanks!
@_date: 2011-11-16 15:21:25
My one almost success at fraud was a guy stealing his own identity. Dumbass.
@_date: 2011-11-15 15:08:08
exactly, =\

Http://accesscoin.com has only been posted here on reddit so far. I really appreciate everyones feedback, it has been very helpful. Before marketing this site I will be making as many adjustments as I can afford.
@_date: 2011-09-06 20:04:44
Current price is $9.20 per btc. Which is %20 margin above the 24h high. I hope to have a more competitive rates in the future.
