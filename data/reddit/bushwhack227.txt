Good people also accept the consequences of disobeying any laws, good or bad. If you don't pay taxes, prepare to accept the punishment.

By not paying, or by posting on reddit? The latter is not disobedience, it's just complaining.

I'm not trying to be dismissive. It's just that civil disobedience is more than just failing to follow the law. It's intended as a protest technique to draw attention to your cause, i.e. making the IRS aware of your refusal and then accepting the consequences, repeating as necessary. Simply skirting the law and hoping no one notices is not any sort of civil act; it's just plain delinquency. You are the only one who benefits from it. While that may serve your own purpose of evading a tax, it does nothing to address the unjustness of the law. That, I submit, is selfish behavior.

well let's put this to the test. if you truly feel you're being persecuted, don't pay. commit an act of civil disobedience. be open about your lawbreaking with the IRS and accept the consequences like a man. At no point should you pay interest or fees on said taxes either, even to avoid arrest.
do this, or just keep being a hypocrite and a coward.

If your purpose is civil disobedience, may I direct you to what Dr. King has to say on the matter:
"One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law."
In other words, there's a difference between civil disobedience and simply disobeying a law because you're a selfish freeloader.
