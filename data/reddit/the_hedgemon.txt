Let them dump. Maybe give us a chance to buy up again.

You should also think about getting a new PC with BTC.

Since when does the posession or receiving of bitcoins automatically apply illegal or scammer related activity? This is probably the most blatantly ignorant thing I have read concerning the Crypto community and you should be ashamed of yourself for implying something like this.

Thats actually not true at all. 
I am a network security engineer for a 3rd party tech support service. 
If your backups are off site OR onsite, backups are performed multiple times a day in either incremental AND complete backups. You would then have multiple images to fall back on. The Ransomeware would not attack those files even if itself was backed up  because its mechanism is running off of a host machine that has network access. Unless the network technician is a retard from hell, no network computer including the servers would have access to live backup files. This includes files on a NAS or offsite backup.

Actually, my friend and I are currently developing an application for Android NFC enabled devices that use Google Wallet to be able to use bitcoins as currency anywhere you go. As long as you are able to pay with an NFC enabled device through Google Wallet, you will be able to pay with bitcoins.
Its in the process of planning and development and testing should begin within a couple months.

1.5 Million dollars is more than a decent lottery winning.
(Please see my comment)

Its not losing anymore. Bitcoin is ahead. 
It would have been nice to put in the title that this link is a poll. It would get a lot more traction. I only clicked on a whim because I read all bitcoin articles...
Also I thought it might have been a lottery for bitcoins... so why not.

I spoke with her father today. I explained the nuances of virtual currency, showed him several videos, my wallet and some excel spreadsheets I quickly produced today with graphs and visual aids. Not only was he interested, I set him up a wallet and actually bought him his first 3 coins. 
He's very interested in the process of mining and wants to actually invest in a miner for his daughter. I informed him of Butterfly labs new rent a Hash program and he thought it was very interesting, but not as interesting as doing it hands on. He asked me to look around into different ASIC's, and then he will buy them and pay me to install them.
Best part is: His spending limit: $10,000. He said make sure its profitable and make sure to teach him and his daughter how to properly use and maintain the hardware and software.
All in all, tonight has been a great success. He wasnt worried about the electricity, but he was curious on its backing and its volatility. He didnt want to see his endevour fail. I showed him info on the consistent rise of the bitcoin, and he said this is definetly safer than the Stock market.

Not always is that the case, but I do see where that is coming from. Just yesterday, I had one of my good friends sisters IM me on facebook asking about bitcoins and how she could get in on the deal. 
She heard about it on the news and began being interested in bitcoins about a week ago. She was asking how could she setup a miner, which wallets to use, which pools to join, and what ASIC's to buy. She is 18 years old and says she is very interested in bitcoins, enough that she convinced her very wealthy father to speak to me about investing into a miner or flat-out buying Bitcoins.. 
Knowing her father, if he is even REMOTELY thinking about investing, the misconception about BTC is starting to fade. I have a conversation with him later in the day, and if anyone is interested on how it goes or want to give me topic and discussion pointers, let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:18:18
Absolutely. I will reply directly to everyone who asked to make sure you get notified of it on reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:04:00
I will let you know on this thread once we speak. I think electricity is his last worry with his sized house. However there is always an [alternative] ( if that does becomes a factor.

I dont mean to be Shrill, but I have been waiting for the BTC market to crash. I dont have a lot of coins and want to invest and buy more, but not at the current value, thats too much. If it does crash, the first thing im doing is investing a couple thousands dollars into it. I know its going back up if it does, Im just hoping I can buy them cheaper before they do.

I have actually been working on an idea similar to this one. It is still in the theoreticall process, however thus far seems to be very possible. 
Its basically a BTC debit card with no cash value until something is bought.

Whatevs... Ima rent-a-hash through BFL

I think one of the greatest parts about bitcoin is its not priced at a certain level for conversions. You were lucky if you had bitcoins for a dollar a piece back in the day because they are worth hundreds now. Not only can it be used to purchase and obtain goods, it can also be used to increase your worth. Kinda like stocks... kinda.

Sorry buddy, the internet makes honest folks out of all of us. We tell it like we see it. The questions was what would we do, no what should we do.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:00:30
Well, time to invest in some ASIC miners.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:30:25
I mean look at all their links. Their facebook and Twitter links lead to the real deal links. But any of their about sections or Help section links are all 404s. Like really? Cmon, it looks legit, but you peel back a few links and all you get is 404.
Amateur hour.

Exactly. The idea is to have bitcoins instantly transferred into dollars via an exchange for the amount your purchase requires. We still have to work out the kinks in making it instant, but we have been developing methods for that.

Keep 50% and wait for value to grow. Sell the other 50% on the market and buy a nice house and nice car.
Current BTC value at time of posting (TP): $141.10
Value of 5,000 BTC (TP): $705,000
Current total value of said bitcoins: ~1.5 Million dollars
If the current market [projections] ( will continue in their current patterns, you could expect (growth rate of ~20%) to make an additional $159,000 by the end of one year today just off of the holdings of the 50%.
That being said, the bitcoin is a volatile currency and is currently involved with underground drug trafficking which could cause potential problems in the future for either is value or existence. I would make money off of it while I can, and save the rest hoping for the future of BTC to be a pleasant one.
But thats only what I would do.
