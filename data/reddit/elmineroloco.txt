Sorry but I dont understand we were talking about customers protection not mercha ts. An actually today bitcoin it does offer more protection to merchants than to customers as you know you cannot reverse a payment.
You talk about a no trust payment method. That no trust is not between payer and paid. Is between user a issuer of the payment method. And I don't know where you read low security system but a p2p massive network to authenticate your transactions doesn't seem low security to me. It is very ambitious of course...
So yes customer protection a d merchant is not about the payment method and in should work the same as money.

In argentina we have official dolar price and black market dólar price... official is cheaper but not available. black is expensive and is available... whats the price then?
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:29:13
Maybe because you dont have access to dolars... or maybe because if you do you cannot send those dolars abroad as you cant make bank transfer with them. Or someone wants to send u money from abroad and bitcoin is more secure than a bank transfer (we know government controls banks too) and more profitable. Because u put the price to the btc not to fhe dolars in the bank. Could be a lot of reasons.
I live in argentina
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:08:13
Well yes it is harder to regulate black markets but what i mean. But i dont mean about regulation but forbidding.  Is much easier to forbid traditional currency like is happening in argentina or venezuela than cryptos.
Talking about official adption you are rigth this countries are the best chance to get a block like china. their economic policies are incompatible with btc's freedom.
But the streets are other markets and i think btc is hard to block

you have just mixed up paying taxes on assets with expropriate or confiscate assests. What are completely different. And actually let me point out, last Argentinians bankruptcy happened in 2001 after selling and giving to private administrations every state company or service...
And BTW I don't support expropriation of companies, assest, etc of privates.
But you know why would you need to pay taxes by producing wine in Argentina. To make it easy to explain, would you need water for your vines don't you? Water that need to be transported to your vineyard. That would be the job of a probably private company authorized and subsidized by the state.(If that company is not state's service.) That company almost has a monopoly on that business and the water they will sell you is cheap enough to make you sell on profit even paying the state taxes.
You know this year, when at the north of argentina didn't rain and lots of crops were about to get spoiled, some actually did. Farmers where paying trucks with water to pour into the crops, and all of them complained because that was very expensive and was taking all their cut. You know what all those farmers get a subsidize, and actually in the USA this happens as well.
Well that happens with the roads that you will use to take your wine out of your vine yard as well, or the airport or port that you'll use to export your wine. Shall I keep sying more??

It`s obvious you just read and understand what you want to see. I`ve never defended this government, actually i`m not argentinian so I don`t have right to vote. Never defended expropriation.
I just defended taxes, to pay taxes don`t make free water or electricity. What you don`t want to see is that sell water or electricity is not profitable if the state doesnt subsidize your company to build the infrastructure to mke that business. Same happens with railway transport, telecomunications and a very large etcetera, and actually that happens too in the USA with capitalist gorvernment. Guess why they do it...
What i`m still wondering is what makes you think that the argentinian government would like to expropriate your vineyard?

But you talk like if argentina where the only country in the world. I just defended paying taxes.
If You had talked about build your vineyard in USA, Italy or wherever and export with bitcoins to avoid taxes, I've had said the same... but you just talk about argentina... so ok mate!!! yes argentina is going to bankrupt, tell me something I don't know. I never discussed you that...
good luck!!!

well as I was living on that time in argentina I can say. But what I know is that a lot of people had a USD bank account and Pesos account it was a common thing to move your savings to the USD account in 1 to 1 you got Pesos converted to dolars instantly.
As well and todays houses, flats, etc are valuated in USD...
but anyways nowadays is a very very different thing, and that image of trading dolar in the street is an every day market in some spots of buenos aires...

UK government is corrupt as well, or the spanish or the USA government, and there are people avoiding taxes in al countries, by different reasons. But mainly because they are allowed. In argentina, as you said because of corruption of the government, is in a bigger scale. Because in that manner government are able to steal easier.
So people avoid taxes just because they want to pay less, how they try to justify it is another subject.
Holding your savings in bitcoins, might avoid you pay some taxes but not in an illegal way as its not regulated. As well as operate with them, there is no law that say transactions should pay VAT or other tax, what pays taxes are my assets in pesos. Again, no one is making something illegal dealing with bitcoins in Argentina, until they changed or make the law.
And it's ok if you want to justify your illegal activities in that way: 
why I'm don't steal public money, if the government will steal.
why don't steal the bank on the corner, bank robberies happend.   
why don't sell illegal drugs if someone will sell it anyway.
why don't kill people, someone will kill anyway.
You know what's are the problems in Argentina, a 34% of the economy is undeclared. That is tax fraud and avoid, that's no water for people, that still happends here, or no sewer, hospitals, schools, free university (that happends here!!) no money for roads, train, bus or subway, no money for research and development, no industry...
So it's ok you want to justify, but if you avoid taxes you don't have the right to complain about government theft.
I do pay all my taxes and with the money I got I do have the right to do what ever I want. but that is a moral or ethic view. Actually you can do what ever you want, the job of prosecuting you for tax fraud or avoid is the IRS, AFIP whoever does it in your country...
Yep maybe it's a fools view, but do you really think someone is making any bad to the thief government avoiding taxes? actually no, they will steal the same, because that doesn't allow them to steal more money there are amounts of money to move under the radar and have more money doesn't change that...
So if you are going to make business but the law won't let you take profit or what ever, just don't do it. If you do, get rid of the victim speech - ooh, poor me government steals with taxes to middle class people -, the good will person and stop going on sunday to church (it's just to make my point, don't say you go to church)...
honestly it's a shame that bitcoin is really going to that, to tax avoid... so all the news from the haters that it's going to be used for money laundry gonna be true...

Thank for your answer, i'll keep an eye on you and see how you keep carrying on with your work.
but as the price of GHs is lower on each diff increase, I think there's no business on investing that way. A business model like cex.io i think is better, but not good enough although.

@_date: 2013-10-30 18:59:52
hehehe you didn't spoil anything but if you keep telling I bet you will. In argentina since a year and a half we got a forex control so nobody can buy foreign currecies, un less you got some reason. That's to control the use of USD like you say. Here you can got to the supermarket and pay with USD or Euro.
So blackmakert of currencies is a very lucrative business, it very crazy all this. But tha is one of the reasons why in argentina bitcoin is becoming important.
People who doesn't trust the Argentinian Peso bets for BTC and also can send money abroad. As you can understand, if you can't buy any currency, you can't make bank transfers to the world.

What is funny is economists or people that "knows" about that say. What kind of currency is so volatile? I wonder if they can say just one currency or finance product with a so small market that is not volatile.
how poeple will want to buy bitcoins and most spent them...
And that is the best part... their greedy wont let them see that people dont want money in the pocket people want things. People want a house a car clothes travels
We have lot of people here that are the example. I'm selling because i want to pay my college debt or because i'm making whatever i want.
The less it is is a pozi scheme they think that because they think the profit is fiat not what you will do with it.

is disgusting see how greedy make people say and do things. Yeah I've got both, and don't think are incompatible. Actually the beautifull thing of cryptos is that if you don't like a currency because whatever you don't like... you just sell off and go other place, fiat, gold ltc, btc, nmc, dvc or fucking sexcoins if you want.... but let people do what they want.
If not what you are doing is obligating people to use a currency, so what are we now a FIAT? If you want digital money you have to use BTC, THAT'S BS!!!
Cryptos power is in being an alternative currency an for that being true you have to tolerate variety!!!

@_date: 2013-11-15 04:29:28
I didn't know until i came to live in argentina. The fact is that it afects more than you can imagine to peoples life. Because companies that import stuff to sell are fucked. As theh have to pay in dolar or euro. So they have to buy that currency in the black market which is more expensive. So you customer that want to buy an iron for your clothes it cost the double in argentina than in spain.
Companies that export outside doesn't want clients to wire money to their bank account in argentina. Because they get the official rate. Is better if they get it in the cou try undeclared and sell that currency at blackmarket so they get more national currency.
It depends how big is the diference between official rate and blackmarket rate how big is the issue. In venezuela blackmarket rate is 10 times the official rate... so you go with dolars and everything is cheap... is very crazy thing

well there is a large port of bitcoin supporters that actually are supporters because of the alternative to current financial sistem that bitcoin represents. So is to be expected that enemy felling from them. But as this becomes bigger that thought will decrease.
As new people will get in with other reasons. And the bank haters will realise that bitcoin without banks won't be the same, the biggest value of BTC it's its own alternative concept, bitcoin has todays worth because people can decide about him. I mean decide to use it, and if they don't like it, always they can return their assets to fiat.
So i think bitcoin, banks and creditcards are not enemys. But it is competence, and don't be surprise when you start seen more often news about bitcoins that it'd be shown as the devil, because we'll be in someone's the interests.
Don't be surprise to hear that a system based on deflation economy will destroy the world economi because i'll take us to a crisis. That people won't use their money if tomorrow worths more. What is just stupid BTW...
BTC probably will change some rules stablished on the financial world system

I'm not defending nor accepting it. I just quoted what actually litecoin say in their site. If you understood something else you made it up my friend...
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:45:09
That depends.
if your plan is borrow BTC sell them for fiat with a solid trading strategy to buy at cheaper price it is a risky business but it's posible. 
I f you plan sell for fiat and buy a TV, so you can pay back on monthly instalments... then you are right

one thing is make a bad investment, and pay a money for something that it doesn't worth it. Other thing is don't even get what you paid for.

Astropay seems to make exchange rates from argentinian pesos ARS to USD at 10.5 ARS/USD the highest price on the black market... ARS/BTC rates skyroketing. That is bad if btc is more expensive than USD people won't buy it....

thanks for your attention.
Bitcoin isn't the thing, it is crypto-currency. Bitcoin is to crypto-currencies like hotmail to email. The important thing here is the technology developed. Then we had yahoo, gmail and more...
that is the important thing, don't think just in bitcoin

so you come here to write a fucking bible about why bitcoin is going to crash under what it was before chinese market came in game, saying you have an educated guess. You claim that your sources explains why is that true...
but your sources doesn`t explain why it is really going lower that before. Those just say:
* what sites are banned from china (not relevant)
* why they devalue their currency (not relevant)
* yes, china was dominating bitcoin world market (might be relevant)
* a huge miner company is in china (might be relevant)
* and from now it` be dificult to trade in china (not relevant)
but... in which of those say that bitcoin is going to crash lower than before china?? Yes I can read in that events that is going to drop... but why lower than before?? please be more specific what value is before china?? or your educated guess cannot advance a value??
All that you are saying is true, as far as I know.... but you input a lot information here that is relevant to china out of the game, yes! but not relevant to bitcoin value lower than before china.
and to finish you add an under line which says all I have said may not happend do your reseach, then your sources are useless??.... so I don`t want to offend but this post is a big ball of shit...
do you have any interest in bitcoin going so low?? maybe you where of those big whales that sold at 500 and when reached to 1000 you regret of that maybe you are looking for your second chance to get in the game,but......
Please note that is my assumption. Please do not be offend based on this.

I live in argentina where inflation is between 10% or 25% a year, depends of if you ask goverment or the rest of the country.
With that who looses are the workers, that don't get their salary increased like the inflation your are **** up, but companies can just increase the price of their product whenever they want. so tell me who gets benefit from that.
Nobody wants to save money, nor put it into a bank. Because of the inflation, interest rates for loans are prety high, higher than inflation. But interests on deposits in banks are lower than inflation so you loose money.
The banks literally doesn't have money to lend. So interests are higher then.
Yep everybody wants to spend and get debt.
Me and my wife bought our home, a 7th floor flat two bedrooms, one bathroom, etc... 7 year ago, today with that amont of pesos you can buy a peugeot 308...
we got a 30 years mortgage. Probably in 30 years my payment for the mortgage will be a kilo of tomatos.
Is that a business for the bank?? do you think the bank still lends money to people? If they lend you money with so high interests, a normal couple with 2 regular incomes can't by a home.

there are people who actually recognize litecoins benefits and as well there is disagreement on if those are relevant or not.
I don't really know If one coin is better than others, I think cryptoeconomy is a good thing thats why i'm in.
But I've not seen any reasoned critic to altcoins that I couldn't hear from a fiat fanatic that doesn't understand cryptos. I just see the same speech with different names...

I had some coins there to get the interest rate they where offering. I don't know who is that realsolid guy. But I had not problem at all with the site. I read last week It was halted the trading and It will be out for a time so it was notifying to get your coins out. So I did, not problem at all.
I'm actually quite happy with that site, and it's write when he says hasn't been hacked. It also counts with a protection agains  51 attacks, so If an attack is detected to a coin's network it halts the trading so It won't cooperate to the exchange that double spent coins.
Despite of that, those new terms are quite hard. But most the fact of not logging in in 2 months. I think that is the biggest mistake and is not fair.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:43:29
well I think a situation where it fit by force is in venezuela, where foreign currencies have tighter controls. 
I'm from Spain I've been living here in argentina for almos 3 years, and for me is quite stressing that your savings looses value every day, you speak with argentinians and they tell me you know nothing this is not a crisis... :S and actually I don't know as I wasn't here on the hiperinflation times.
The bitcoin movement is growing here and I think as the currencies controls grows more will grow. I sold a bitcoin on localbitcoins, just to see how fast I could sell. It took 10 minuntes.
@_date: 2013-10-26 04:11:23
i'm starting to think like you, and it's a shame because i believe in the great concept that bitcoin means. But people with this kind of "business" are going to spoil it.

well if you pay on paypal it will appear in your creditcard bill Paypal "username_of_seller" they won't know what did you buy. I live in argentina and it is illegal buy currencies... but nobody said bitcoin was a currency. Actually in spain the law has to be changed to consider bitcoin as money. Because just currency issued by another government is considered money. I don't know in venezuela...
