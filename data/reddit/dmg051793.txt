What is the benefit of not keeping them in an exchange? Why does everyone seemingly recommend against it?

Can someone please ELI5: Futures?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:51:32
Also looking. Thanks!

Want a follow up...

Thank you for your help today.

I think I get you now... In other words, I am paying for a voucher now from someone at x price that states if btc reaches a certain $, and if it gets there, the bitcoin is then sold to me. So like margin trading.
Lastly, can someone ELI5 why they think this is bad for the future of btc in the long term?

So one can agree to buy a future (unmined yet?) bitcoin from someone like cboe, and they will also sell it for you at an early agreed upon rate?
I appreciate your comment, but it felt like an ELI8 instead of a ELI5.

I'm interested.

Thanks. Much appreciated. What if I am looking to add weekly/bi-weekly purchases into btc? Does it still make sense to stick with the hardware wallet? If so, then I'll pull the trigger on a Ledger Nano.

Yes absolutely. Thank you for taking your time to explain it to me.
How is pricing determined if someone is trying to control this network of exchanges? It can't be that similar to how btc is currently priced, right?
This sounds like a terrible idea and against the foundation of the blockchain.
