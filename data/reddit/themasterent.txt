Wow, did everyone forget the part where this does nothing for Bitcoin. In fact, now by using Paypal, you get a fee on your Bitcoin transaction just like if you used cash. Great job guys, really moving forward here. Fucking Bitpay.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:29:03
It's like Bitpay wasn't supposed to be the Paypal of Bitcoin, ever, and just wanted to cash in? Oh and WTF people, I thought everyone hated Paypal and banks because, fees and shit, but apparently we are now applauding the acceptance of Bitcoin on Paypal, even if it comes with handing over 2.75% of the transaction amount to Paypal. Which is obviously only acceptable if the transaction fees are collected in an effort to mitigate disputes/claims.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:21:49
It's like ZOMG, paypal and bitcoin, seomthing something same sentence, to the moon.
Yet, everyone forget's Bitpay was supposed to be the Paypal of Bitcoin so you didnt have to pay Paypal a 2.75% fucking fee, now you get to send Bitcoin through Paypal, and pay a fee for them to effectively do nothing, unless the use of paypal somehow comes with a product guarantee that Paypal backs and pays out of the fees collected in the event of a claim.
Wait who am I kidding, it's fucking Paypal, the transaction fee goes to Paypal for the profits.
Again, fuck Bitpay for thinking this is moving forward.
Ill redact all of this if someone can prove to me Paypal doesn't take a cut.

The first part of what you said is exactly why you take this as a warning and dont ignore it. People are fucking idiots.
Also, a couple malicious miners that have a few thousands coins each from when they started mining in 2010 could easily manage something like this. Posting it to pastebin by logging in thru Tor would make your post basically untraceable and easy for the others to find and then work together to profit together. And then more people see it making it ring out and cause a larger profit grab.
Again, a second post.

Im not implying a flaw in the tor protocol, rather the webserver protocol that would allow the IP to be viewable when the site is down for maintenance. As you said it, the webserver wont stop from serving the page, however if there was something written somewhere that said "dont show the ip address" then the page wouldnt be served. It isnt a flaw in tor, rather in webserver software itself.

Bitpay is tge paypal of bitcoin. Coinbase is most certainly meant as a buy and sell bitcoins quickly. The only problem is to do this securely it requires both banks involved to verify the transactions, which takes days. Hence why bit coins is so great,  they allow for the transfer of large sums of wealth quickly and securely without the middle man taking his large cut. Coinbase does their job, but they are a new company plagued with a problem they have no control over. Also they have a limited number of coins they can sell a day right now and only a couple guys working there.

That is more or less what I was already thinking. So maybe I will buy a Jalapeno and an Avalon. To bad neither one will be available for a few months. And the income would be mere pennies after next difficulty increase, and even less the one after that.
I would really like to get involved and do things right, 1500 bucks just seems somewhat ludicrous and a little to much for such a small return.  The Avalon system appeals to me minus the cost in electricity (I think of it as an investment. Whats a couple bucks thrown at electricity when the system should generate a currency that has a constantly rising value (into the future years, not months).
It just seems so impractical to spend a plethora of money a week/month of individual coins, constantly paying the market value each time when I could run a rig to generate around the same or less over a year but also be able to run nonstop. More or less, it makes sense to invest in a 1500 miner today if the cost of coins is gonna sky-rocket in a number of years. Granted the miner can garner me 25coins in a year.... Wait, if I can mine 25 in a year for 1500, then the value of the coins would need to have risen to 60usd to be worth the investment. I think thats a real possibility. Hopefully they decrease in value after the intital shipment of miners goes out before a steady incline again (sell my Pfizer stock for something that may actually be worth having some day).
Edit: Wish I had jumped and bought a shit-ton of B back when I stumbled into the silkroad. They were a mere 1.xx a piece if I recall.

If he is a true gambler, most people "let it ride" when they win. So betting the same bet following your winning bet is fairly common practice.

Yes Bitpay which allows you to put a button on your Web page and run one transaction for each person. This other system allows you to be offline til the end of the day (if it doesn't it should) keeping you hidden and your business wallet safe from being hacked during the work day.

Coinbase sells them out of a stock they have. When the BTCs have been purchased there are no more to buy that day and you will have to try again the next day or keep trying periodically. IIRC they operate on a 24 hour block the hour of start I do not know. Today they have just seen a serious increase in sales and thus have run out.

Yeah, I went on their to buy drugs (obviously, right?) but was like "how the fuck am I suppose to get bitcoins?!!, This is a hassle, fuck this."
While obviously money can be used to buy sex, drugs, and guns in the real world people constantly saying "but they have the silkroad" is no way to make people wanna invest. They will simply see it as the online black market. Either way, just like with regular cash people can do illegal things. But just like with guns, the money isnt what does the illegal activities, it's the person in charge of it. So while you can use bitcoins to buy drugs online and have them delivered to your door whos saying making the silkroad illegal will stop people from using it. If people are motivated enough to do something they are gonna do it anyways. Digital curency or not the people will still use it for shady transactions.

Shoulda boosted your confidence. We basically have a 24/7 tech support team there to solve problems when they arise, not when they feel like it. Will this sorta thing happen again, most likely.  When, i have no idea. Will we be prepared next time, yes. And the developers will do a better job this time to see things thru. I would suggest one pool of miners to beta test the software releases from now on for 2 weeks prior to public release so that these things don't happen again.  It was unforseen and they will definitely quadruple check clients against eachother in future releases to better manage such a thing.

I disagree with this 100%. If we were post nuclear war America, and there were Chinese soldiers within the US borders setting up camps and shit, I would much rather have food, ammunition, and medical supplies. What in the fuck am I gonna do with gold when they are trying to break my door down? Throw it at them and hope they run away. Be serious, gold has no value except for the fact that it is rare, and pretty, and is highly conductive. Other than that, it's pretty much useless in terms of usefullness and survival. If you were lost in the Canadian woods, would you rather have an ounce of gold, or an AR-15 with 700 rounds, a full army field med kit, and 2 weeks rations.

Thats not true. With Coinlab being centered in Silicon Valley, and partnered with Silicon Valley Bank to accept all USD deposits and withdrawls. This sets them up for an easy national transmission of money from any US bank account to their exchange and in turn back. This will be 100% as they are also subject to FinCENs guidelines as a Money Transmitter. Send 500 from your US bank account to another US bank account, should clear in less than 3 days, you win.

Fyi I bought my coins at 42.7 and they were still not in my account. I had no control over what happened and could have lost money as I saw them dip below 37. I stopped being worried about the sell off as soon as it started to climb again, and said wow this recovered faster than I could have hoped. That doesn't happen in the stock exchange. People trust in this service and the people running it. Why? Because we all have a stake in it and thus equally matters to all of us. If the system isn't working every one stops making money, not just you. I'm glad this happened yesterday, we'd probably be a lot worse off if it happened next year. This shows that bitcoin is resilient and doesn't give a fuck about no software glitches, it will soldier on doing what it's supposed to do.

Ahhh yes. He failed to mention the part where it works exceptionally well as a way to get money from America to Japan without the use of banks and transaction fees and long wait times.  
If the bitcoin is to be used as an Internet gold standard then there would need to be currency poured into them to make each coin have a value that can then be bought or sold and quickly transmitted for a couple cents.  
The idea is to turn bitcoins into a service, a product, a commodity, and an asset. By investing in bitcoins they are given a value, allowing people or businesses to buy them from you on an exchabge so they can get their money from their American branch to their Brazilian office in the same afternoon.  For that to happen they would only need a market share of 600billion,or roughly 1% of the 60trillion world GDP. them each coin is worth 285000 dollars of government currency, and can now be sent it blocks or packs of coins to move 5million from America to France (or anywhere in the world) faster, and more secure than banks. Once across the pond they would either sell a fraction of them on the the xchange to get what they needed for business for that day leaving a portion of them to drive up the value, or sell them back to you on the exchange for equal value in that countries currency. 
Bitcoins are poised to be a 50ounce digital gold bar worth 250k each that governments and big business uses to pay eachother.

No. If Apple wants to send money from Cupertino to their UK office it would work similar to this. Go to local bitcoin exchange, initiate a purchase of 1billion USD worth of bitcoins (like banks use gold bars to transfer money), send it to their bitcoin address in the UK, where they can either leave it in bitcoin or withdraw it in Euros. The only way that would be a viable option is if it was worth millions of dollars or hundreds of thousands a coin. They are like digital gold. They are a medium of exchange. Only a coupe vendors online offer bitcoin purchases for bitcoins, most are just a 3rd party willing to spend their own money on goods on Amazon in exchange for bitcoins.

It's a flaw that the IP would remain hidden unless the server was down for maintenance. There is no "if then" written that states when the server is down for maintenance, stop serving pages period, or omit the IP when insecure.

Expect to get burned only when you don't actually watch the market. While yeah, one minute it could be up, then next down. Dont buy when it is on an incline. Dont sell on a decline unless it fell below the last dip. There is plenty to it. Over the week I made a 15% return. Only because I was careless and left an order pending while I went and took an exam did I lose 66% of my return for the week during the dip. Other than that my account is still positive my intitial investment.

I highly doubt YOU personally are sending 100k. Stop worrying about things that do not directly affect you. Try sending 100k with Liberty Reserve and see if they still only charge you 2.99. Conveniently their [fee page]( stops showing at 10k. Do you want to know why?
Edit: I'll just [leave this here]( so I don't have to come back. It's illegal to transmit over 10k without the paperwork that ties you directly to the money, for laundering prevention. So a 10k transfer with liberty reserve is 2.99, and btc-e is 20. Their is a lot more tying you to the Liberty Reserve transfer than the BTC-e transfer. You are paying for convenience and anonymity. Over time as they pick up in number of transactions you are likely to see the fee go down. Until then charging anything less than 0.2% is not going to cover their books, or operating costs.

A protocol is the standard everyone adheres to. If the server is down for maintenance and during which time you can scour the server and reveal the public IP, then there is a flaw in the protocol that allows this information to be viewable. It is a standard and default configuration, obvisouly overlooked because one would not expect this to be the case with a site all about security. A flaw in the protocol that shows the public IP for a private site when the security of the server is compromised during maitenance. 
The title is not fitting because it isnt like the SR is intentionally leaking the IP address to the general public or a government entity intentionally. If the owner of the site was aware the address was publicly available as such, then he would have been sure to change it to cover his own ass (Kim Dotcom ring a bell). So don't write sensationalist titles to scare people, it was a simply overlooked default settings that can easily be fixed now that it has been brought to the attention of the admin.

You act like I don't get what your sayin, I do. It still cheaper than fiat, by far. PayPal is 2.7% each time u send a transaction. The visa charge is like 3% everytime you just don't see it as it comes out of the total. Even making 100 trades a day on mtgox that's still only 0.65%. Of course there is a small amount of money lost with each cash transaction. They banks and clearing houses still have to do work.

Im not sure what you are implying with this statement. But I definitely dont think banks should be what they are. Banks should be a place you can safely store your money until you use it. Keeping it safe from thieves. 
What banks do tho is take all the money they are given and invest it by either lending out more than they have in assets, or gambling it in calcualted investments on the stock market. The FDIC ensures your money up to 300,000 (it went up recently) if you store it in a bank. But who is to say the bank wont lose all your money, hence part of why the Fed insures it.
This is also why it takes days to withdraw large amounts of cash. The have to get your money from their central pool.

Take my private key, and mix it with any one of 10 predetermined other keys. Take your private key and multiply it with any one of the predermined keys (the private key is related to the public key thru an algorithm). Now I send you bitcoins. The blockchain uses the 10 predetermined keys to decrypt the two random private keys it received for this transaction. If the two private keys match the ones generated from the public keys, then you have a match and it was not a counterfeit transaction. If the one key doesnt match, then it doesnt work.
This is also similar to how we can use escrow in bitcoin with 3 people to complete a transaction for a large sale. Im not going to go into it, but it uses the process of colors. There is a video around somewhere for it where this gets explained.

No it doesnt. Because the idea is to get away from banks and credit card agencies. It speeds things up significantly, and 1% no matter how you lay it out, is still cheaper than 2.99 or 3 or 4%. Your butthurt cause a couple of specialized companies charge a flat rate fee because it is all they do. You will see specialized companies popup that do the same thing with bitcoin, it's still new. Just cause Dwolla and Liberty Reserve dont chage an increasing percent doesnt "ruin the integrity of the bitcoins cheap transaction publicity". Bitcoin is still cheaper than 95% of the other options, the 5% that it isnt cheaper than come with days waits to get your money. While bitcoin takes a matter of minutes to an hour.
