I would say it would be the best to wait until after the halving event. This might not be the ideal time to enter :)

The easiest way is to purchase some bitcoin with either Coinbase or Circle. If you don't want to spend more $ on it, you can increase the amount of bitcoin you already have by lending it out to people through peer-to-peer lending sites such as btcjam or bitbond.
btcjam boasts that their autoinvest feature can bring you an interest of up to 12.4% each year.
Cloud mining can be much more profitable than that, but it is also very risky because if the amount of hashrate in the network increases, the amount of hashrate you own will generate less and less bitcoin overtime. However, there are still some reliable sites worth trying.
The safest way, in my opinion, is to put your bitcoin into a interest-bearing wallet such as haobtc.
If you have more than 10 bitcoin, you can earn up to 15.58% per year with this wallet.

Good luck!

OK,  so that was a confusion in terms of terminology. When I was talking about ROI, I was referring to ROI/year in general, not just the first year. 
Yeah, but I also agree with you that ROI tends to decrease in reality

From Jan 27 2015 to Aug 22 2015, when there was not that much volatility in the bitcoin price, the change in difficulty only ranged from -6.14% to 5.84% (yes, it did decrease sometimes). The recent spike in difficulty only followed a sudden rise in bitcoin price.
Like I said, the total hashrate and the price don't always keep pace with each other. It's unrealistic to expect the amount of hashrate to change right after every move in the price. But in the long run, it will respond to the price.
But I'm quite curious about how you could arrive at 29%, can you expand on that?

Thank you for your opinion. I didn't mention the difficulty increase in that particular article because I was writing about that in a different post. But now I'm aware that leaving that part out could plant some inaccurate assumptions in some beginners' head.
 
I personally believe in the ability of the bitcoin network to adjust itself to reach an equilibrium. The increase in difficulty is caused by new miners entering the game, which is caused by the rise in bitcoin price. So when the network difficulty increases, the amount of bitcoin you gain each day is decreased but the dollar amount is actually not affected much.
Of course, this is just a simplified view. There are times when the market is not in equilibrium and the mining profitability is either decreased or increased. But I believe this is only temporary, and the market will fix itself in the long run. 
P/s: I just added a disclaimer to the article. I'll write more about mining profitability calculation later. Thanks again!

Cloud Mining can be a good way to start if you can find the right companies. Check out my blog for details.

That was totally my bad when I forgot to put the original source in the post. I never intended to steal anyone's work. That was an editorial mistake, and I just fixed it. I hope you understand and thank you so much for pointing it out.
