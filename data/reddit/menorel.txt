I'm still working on to filter out exchange and bigger miner reward distribution addresses. I hope I can do it with a volume analyse and with some regression modelling. As I can achive any result I will share my result. Ofcouse, as you mentioned, current result are garbaged with exchanges 
btw: exchanges (nowadays) should decrease the overall bitcoins of whales, because many bitcoin owners transfer out their coin to self hosted wallets because split chain.

whales addresses is came from a snapshot. There is no a strict minimum amount limit, instead I set a hard limited number of addresses what I can currently handle. (1000 addrs). So the minimum btc amount of whales dinamically changing between 1000-2500 BTC. Later, I would like to spread addresses to three category: whales (1000+ BTC), dolphins (100-1000 BTC) and small fishes :) (10-100 BTC).

Hi, I remove it as you asked. But can you please show me any other visualisation/explanation how can I imagine the SegWit? As I understand (before your comment), the SegWit what will activated in next period means: existing 1Mb blocksize will be increased with a 3Mb "segwit" extension for sender's signatures. If I understand correctly your response: this extension will not a fixed in 3Mb, it could be changed based on the necessary space for sender's signatures, is this correct? Thanks,
