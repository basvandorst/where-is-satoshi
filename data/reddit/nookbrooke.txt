It's priced in guys....the big buyers would fall all over themselves to buy more if they thought the halving coming up would lead to a big run up....I'm probably wrong and I hope I am!!!

Thank you!! Happy holidays to this insane...disfunctional Bitcoin family!!
@_date: 2015-12-05 01:54:53

@_date: 2015-12-09 16:41:02

Well that was fukin disturbing.....
@_date: 2015-08-29 23:32:31
My thinking was something like this.....
Google created Alphabet.....Alphabet has many businesses and projects under its umbrella.....1 of these business under Alphabet uses Bitcoin and its technology to transfer funds between each other (P2P) rather than the old ways of money transfer......meaning fees both going and coming.....waiting for funds to clear.....Centralized 
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:14:50
Thank you!!! Will definitely pass it on!! 
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:00:48

I would wait and buy on the next dip down to $273-$277 range.....just my own little opinion....seems run up is pretty fast so I think it may pull back to the $270-$277 range and stabilize there...then a run up to try the $300 level again....I really have no idea what I'm talking about though...lol...

But wasn't the big run up to $1200 a Mt Gox Bot run amok? This last rally feels solid for lack of a better word....
@_date: 2015-11-15 19:05:47
Would you sign up for $3200 a piece Bitcoin if there was some centralized and some privacy demands when and or if it goes mainstream??
