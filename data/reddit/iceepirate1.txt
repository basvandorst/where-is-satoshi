My dad always tells me about the bitcoin stuff on the news. Since i'm in the mining business, he's probably less worried. Still gets worried whenever it dips. He's used to the news saying it's dead though, so at least there's that.

That's not the only benefit. The main benefit of the service is margin trading. Plus, you get a few other goodies too.

You see, bitcoin can drop 50% in a moments notice too!

This...this is why I like mining. If the chart goes down too much, cash out and sell my hardware. Chart stays stagnant or increases? Reinvest the earnings!

I actually sold at 19.5k. I sold it to buy another GPU mining rig lol.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:39:54
Something Something, my bitcoin I bought at $3 would now be worth 100x my 401k if I didn't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:14:34
This isn't a dip. I fully expect bitcoin to return to 10000 by New year's. I will eat a slice of pizza if im wrong.

You see, there's a reason that all of the newcomers are calling this crashes. Traditional 8-4 markets only display market information for that day and use percentage/amount numbers based off of this. Yes, the stock market does see 24hr trading, but not to the extent that crypto is traded, scaled of course. 
New entries into the crypto stage expect this same movement that they have been raised to expect. They expect that anything above 1-2% movement within a day cycle is extraordinary compared to the norm.
Now there are 3 main reasons for these massive price movements
1. There is no central governing body for almost all of these coins, therefore there is very little in the way of market regulation to help stabilize the markets in times of big swings.
2. Relative to most other currencies, crypto is still in it's infancy, or maybe toddler stage now. All of the other currencies are already established and have been for centuries or their governments have existed for centuries. As the currency gets more saturated with users, the price will start to stabilize as the currency reaches equilibrium with the rest of the world's currencies. This is simply due to the world running out of people who are interested in having crypto.
3. This style of currency is unlike anything we have ever seen before. Sure, we have seen 24hr stock markets and currency exchanges, but those systems don't operate the same. Both of those have to jump through all of the centralized hoops that crypto aims to avoid, by doing this, the market has a much faster reaction time relative to other exchanges. This causes there to be much faster shifts in the currency which can in turn exaggerate price movements from time to time as people receive real time updates.

Printing money leads to inflation. Inflation is really just a way of indirectly taxing savings
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:30:09
You are correct, what I meant to say was excessive printing, the second half is still true though.

There's a lot more to accounting than something an AI can do. That's like saying that an AI programmer job will no longer exist in 3 to 3.5 years brah.

There is the fee per Kb of data, just scales with the number you are sending. Negligible difference overall.
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:53:43
Eh, i'd rather it pump up to 30k then dip back to 7k. Better for me short term to buy more miners and long term, since more coin.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:48:13
I legit sold some at $19500. Only .1, but I still sold some :)

Step 1: Exchange all my monies to equivalent gold bars
Step 2: Sell the gold to USD at a 540,269x profit
Step 3: Repeat
Step 4: ???
Step 5: Keep repeating until I have all the gold, and women.

Might wanna rephrase that to, "Bitcoin will change the way you think about money forever."

I feel like we can start charging it, might be a few days before he gets enough charge.

Eh, there's a lot of cash only places that only accept fiat, hence cash only. Maybe keep a few hundred in cash use the rest in crypto with one of those auto-conversion cards. Thinking of this, I wonder how the first mainstream line of credit in crypto is. Not just margin loans, but stuff like CCs or mortgages.
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:26:03
That is one thing I like. I sold at $19,500 as part of my regular selloff from mining, but now I get to claim bragging rights for the next year or so.

Nah, had everything on a hard drive which I accidentally tossed when upgrading my PC. What are the chances I pick the 1 hard drive out of 67. (I'd imagine I would have a storage server at this point.)

You forget that people WILL confuse this for main BTC. Be it old people, or teens, or that dude whose going through a midlife crisis.

If you can find out a way for ebay to pay me in a different extremely convenient way with lesser fees than paypal, then sign me up.
EDIT: Want to mention, that funnily enough my paypal fees are actually larger than my ebay fees.
