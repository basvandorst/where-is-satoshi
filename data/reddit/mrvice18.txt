Guys, i got tipped by u/red_bagpipes and want a way to withdraw it.
What ln wallet do you guys recommend? And can anybody ELI5 the difference between that and traditional wallets?
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:14:35
So for a newbie, you recommend using Blue Wallet, then as I read on further, I get my own channel, right?
@_date: 2019-07-29 05:15:33

I regret not selling a few when market was at 8000 or 10000 a couple of months ago. Why is it dipping all of a sudden
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:07:06

You guys were giving crazy tips before too

Are telegram miners legit? Like do they even payout? Some are intriguing since they dont require an investment
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:30:17
I sold mine at 5900 due to medical emergencies :(
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:29:51
Username and account age checks out. Well done!

It is! I mean, decentralized, isn't affected by inflation, tech is continuously improving. I don't understand why full adoption hasnt happened yet.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:29:09
I sold all of my btc out of medical necessity last April..����
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:29:07
Good job for you! I accumulated some coins some time ago and was planning on keeping it, but had to sell it all when price was 5900 due to medical emergencies for my kid. :(
I made a smart investment but life happened. Good job to you guys for buying in early on and holding! Wish I was lucky as you or people like you could help me out

BNB is supported by an exchange. Its value increased due to the increase in users of binance/trading volume of binance.
BTC is still no. 1
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:28:16
I love you. Thanks for the silver my man.
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:54:30
Is this still available??
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:05:43
I unfortunately do not know how to do that. All I know is I was left with negative balance in my paypal account which I was left to deal with
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:35:46
I still have a little left right now, but am not in a position financially to load up cause I'm prioritizing my health and my family's financials.
I will be accumulating again, but FOMO is real

Correction isn't coming anytime soon. Awareness is peaking again. Just hodl.
