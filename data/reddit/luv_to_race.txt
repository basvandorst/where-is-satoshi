Like the one meme, if I don't make more on my bitcoin in a day, than I do at work, it's a bad day.

Have even more fun paying CG taxes on it!

I was late to the party.

This math is what pushed me to just go ahead and buy, instead of waiting for the next big crash. That was at $6.5k.

And they are new to bitcoin, just trying to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:57:21
You are, trust me.

Not a lawyer or financial guru. I believe if you have yet to realize gains, you wouldn't have to REPORT that you have it, however if for whatever reason you were asked by a government entity, and actively concealed it, this law would specifically criminalize it.

Great idea! Brb, gotta go update my bio!

Ha. If I had a nickel for every drunk Japanese lesbian that I've converted.... well, I would be broke. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:10:45
This is me too!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:46:38
You mean 19.5k?

Right. As with most laws, they are only a problem for those that choose to break them.

Wirh a side of fava beans, and a nice Chianti.

Nope. It's an uphill stretch. It's an electric bicycle, that hides the motor in the hub, and batteries in the seat tube. There are videos of it, even a 60min story about them.

That's the beauty of a crypto currency, you can take it and move wherever the fuck that you want that's better than here. Bye.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:36:43
Yup, we ALL want to be rich and bat shit crazy!

I'm officially a bitcoin thousandaire. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:49:51
I  ..... I think your missing the point.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:01:57
I know I would be pissed if I lost a ton of Bitcoin, but your comment is just wrong. The translation is much closer to - We didn't have a fucking clue what we were doing, and then we just threw up our hands and said fuckit. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:47:30
I get that. I don't know this case, but if he was trying to keep this business solvent, then trying to avoid a run on the exchange would be necessary. It doesn't make it right. It doesn't help those that got fucked. It could, however have a reasonable explanation within the single minded purpose of saving the business from bankruptcy. Again, he fucked up. Period. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:28:07
Have you ever started/ ran a business that got fucked over by outside forces, and was forced into bankruptcy, and been in way over your head? I have. Saving the business consumes 100% of your life. Unfortunately, like in this case, your best efforts are nowhere near enough to fix it. The lack of communication from the top makes it look like they are intentionally hiding information, and some may be, but many times it is just being blinded by fear, rage, exhaustion, or any other all consuming situation. I am not giving this guy a pass. He fucked up, and he's making an attempt to fix it, or at least mitigate the damages, and reduce the likelihood that it happens to anyone else.

Yeah, literally gambling with others deposits is about as dumb a decision as possible. I understand that those decisions hurt many others. My comment about trying by any means available to try to keep it going is still legit. Again, bad decision, but it could have been made for the right reasons. Did he personally make more money from those actions, or could he have bailed out, and just walked away? I don't understand the nuances of this, but it's just easy to look back with 20/20 vision and question what happened.
