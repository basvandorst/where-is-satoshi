Interesting the DeepBit mining pool last found a block in November 2013 yet one of their addresses [1VayNert3x1KzbpzMGt2qdqrAThiRovi8]( is still one of the top-10 most "[popular]( according to Blockchain.info. Popular = most total outputs.

The WannaCry Ransomware Attack is up to 14.08007493 BTC on 92 payments as of 11:30am ET on May 13. Balance has more than doubled in 12 hours to ~USD$25k. Coincidence BTC hits all-time high while people are scrambling to pay this ransom?

The campaign isn't over but ransom payments are slowing now only  19.8BTC on 133 payments in 48 hours. Do you expect a pickup in payments first business day back?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:46:00

Tainted bitcoin addresses give government all the visibility they need
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:06:53
The emails were so obviously scams it is hard to believe office buildings were actually evacuated over them
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:10:20
All these scammers accomplished was further tarnishing of bitcoin's reputation. None of the bitcoin addresses had received ransom payment by the deadline yesterday.
