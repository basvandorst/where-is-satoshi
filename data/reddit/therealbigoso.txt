From a technical analysis PoV, $14k area is strong resistance. Will require continued dumping in of fiat to bitcoin.

I can only address this comment as nonsense. A regular beta male, which makes up about 90% of the US male population, is not making 100-500K.

This is my ultimate fear. I’m buying only about $150 worth of BTC every month through coinbase and Gemini. I’ve counted on those two since 2017. That would stop and I’d give up crypto if my government banned the USD to bitcoin on ramps.
Some people murmur under their breath that people like me should learn how to do it the hard way. But the easy on ramps provided to me by coinbase and Gemini and now Poloniex are the only reasons I’m doing crypto period.

This sounds un-PC, but what does the community think of bitcoin as a tool for globalization? A lot of governments in the developing world that have felt the positive effects of increasing globalization are afraid of bitcoin because it makes it easy to transfer money out of their country. Think China. Once they receive US dollars for their goods and services, they want to keep them as long as possible. Could bitcoin be a counterbalance to increased outsourcing of manufacturing and labor for the developed nations like the US, Japan and various European countries?

I’m glad that hackers are finally being empowered to better themselves. Too long has mother dearest burned the bottom of the chocolate chip cookies! And how many times has she bitched about the electric bill being too damn high? Now, with the help of regulated crypto exchanges, the 35 year old incels living in their childhood home can have justice, and everyone else’s cold hard crypto cash.

I’m american, but that doesn’t mean I’m made of gold. The only thing bigger than my salary, 401k and car in terms of worth is my monthly debt. 
I’ve heard people talk about dropping $10-$300K on bitcoin over the course of a few months, but that kind of money doesn’t exist for people of my generation. Except for trust fund kids and people who were lucky enough to get an extremely good pay package working for Google, Apple, Amazon or Microsoft. Remember the average salary in the US is much higher than the median, just like every other country. Even for highly educated folks like myself.
But say I’ve got $50 per week to invest. What can I do besides coinbase? An ATM which is located in another city?

Hypothetically, how would another world war between the major powers effect the utility and price of bitcoin?
I’m not expert on war, but history courses all taught me that the rise of nationalistic power set the stage for all-out war between countries. Reading just reddit alone (excluding all of the real life anecdotes), portions of the youth of various nations - USA, China, India, Europe collectively, Mexico - are all being conditioned to dislike global values.

You’re not even on topic anymore. But luckily I’m interested in this subject as well. I want you to look at two maps of the US. The first is a layout of minimum wages in each state in 2019. The second map is a layout of which states cost the most to live in. You’ll notice that the states with the highest minimum wages are also the states which are most expensive to own or rent in. Because the majority of Americans are too poor to afford living the life they want and flocking to whichever regions will pay them the most. 
My agenda here is to point out that 100-500k is the exception, not the norm. Do I hold grudges against people who make that money? No that is fabricated by the guilt of rich persons. Our brains are built to focus on threats, not positives. 
So for the majority of Americans, buying more than a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin is completely unattainable. Therefore, the easier the on-ramp, regardless of its cost in fees and KYC, the better it is for everyone, the better it is for bitcoin.
Congress and the Senate are not even worried about bitcoin. Why? Because they know most Americans can’t afford to use it.

Not many nearby, and I’ve heard cashing out from BTC to USD isn’t possible.

What time frame do you use for your data and moving averages? The short and intermediate term moving averages for global war point bearish but the long term moving average is still bullish. But there’s a recent spike in nationalist volume, and a lot of it is coming from new market entrants, like young people who are impressionable. The RSI on the yearly timeframe is also telling that we’re overdue for a bounce back toward the mean. And with tightening economic situations across the globe, I could see a potential catalyst for a break out and sudden movement towards a new major war within the next decade with widespread ignorance accompanied by suffering.

It makes some sense. Google doesn’t advertise stocks for free either. Bitcoin isn’t a stock but to a Fortune 500 company whose executives do not care to understand bitcoin better, it kind of is a stock. In the sense that it is a financial vehicle, which companies must typically pay to advertise on Google’s search engine.

Any chance that Facebook has been pumping the price of bitcoin?
My reasoning:
2017 was the last bull run. Any company with two pennies to rub together which added the word “blockchain” somewhere in their title outperformed the market in some form or another. 2018 was the last bear run. Any company with the word “blockchain” in its name probably shut it doors. 2019, new bull run, Facebook bruised and battered from bad publicity, needs new influx of capital. Facebook makes own crypto while simultaneously directly or indirectly pumping Bitcoin price to start new, inorganic bitcoin bull run. Price of Facebook stocks soar on news of new coin and gap-up open on day of coin’s launch.

I wore it before this bull run even started

I’ve been buying $1 USD of Doge per day every day for a while now. 
I call it feeding my doge.

Gemini crashed when I tried to cash out $500 in BTC at $13,800.
I don’t think any broker is able to handle this shit without going broke. Goddamn.

45-46 sat / byte for me. Just stinks I gave a significant fee and got grouped in with the guys who went with much fewer sat / byte.
