Why would I buy bitcoin when I can open a checking account at my local bank that requires less information / scrutiny than coinbase? You bitcoin dreamers seem to have to comply with more 'government regulation' than any average person in the world, antithetical to your own egalitarian propaganda.
Oh yea, and they don't charge me fees to send money, and it's instant. Meanwhile, in bitcoin land, it costs almost a 15-20% fee to send a few dollars. 
There is only one thing bitcoin is used for IRL: Greedy speculators making profit. What average person is going to use bitcoin as currency with the slow speeds, ridiculous fees, and absurd amount of government profiling that goes into buying bitcoin? You also seem to forget that the blockchain is a public ledger, seems like a perfect tool for the government to keep their eye on where you spend your money.
It also amuses me that you believe it is somehow 'for the people' when any rich asshole could have (and likely did) bought the majority of the 21 million circulating supply already. Rich people stay rich for a reason, they're good at it.

Buy litecoin, bitcoin is a centralized millionaries club, it hates the peasants.

Right, and every piece of bitcoin you own has at one point passed through the deepweb. 
You use bitcoin? You support terrorism.

They give more government identification to buy bitcoin than they would to open a bank account, yet bitcoin is somehow magical non-government decentralized currency.

...Meanwhile ..everyone submits photos of themselves, all of their government ID, statistics and birth records to coinbase/exchanges to purchase bitcoin...

That's why I just use litecoin for small transactions, btc for bigger stuff.
