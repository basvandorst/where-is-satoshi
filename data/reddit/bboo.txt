how does this translate to volatility percentage?
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:24:59
sent one too
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:01:04
how come?
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:06:19
I bought 40GHs for 5 years on June 29th for 0.1160 BTC and got 0.10808973 BTC in return until today. Last daily payout was 0.00055902 BTC, so the ROI should be in 14 days if payout doesnt change much.
they pay daily, never had troubles or something. The only thing which scares me is they use the same voicemail/voice actress/music as gawminer customer support

I dont understand this. I paid 0.116 and already got 0.108 in return until today, how is getting the invested money back not breaking even (in 14 days)?

I bought some GHs on bitcoincloudservices around the end of june and I should hit ROI in about ten days. I then still have with 4years+ of mining contract left.

I have 4 contracts on bitcoincloudservices.com (bought between jun 2014 to about oct 2014). The service never had any hiccups, I always get payouts (daily) and the first two contracts already paid off with 3+ years of mining contract left. I didnt invest much so if it goes tits up it doesnt hurt, and I share the thought that cloud mining makes no sense except for ponzi/scam schemes for now, but afaik I cannot complain about a single thing.
