I have seen some reports about it reaching 25,000 by the end of the year. But nothing about February
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:02:17
First crypto joke ever?
Will this be a normal playground joke for kids in 10 years?
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:19:18
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:43:12
That made me laugh from my belly. Tron was the best
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:05:48
Amazing 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:48:14
Time to buy 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:24:38
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:42:32
Gonna get worse before it gets better 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:14:39
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:48:52
Why Feb 28th?
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:02:46
You will not regret those tattoos. Seriously. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:05:57
I loved it! Well done 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:57:10
Not sure we will see the massive rise of last year ever again. I am a hopeful pessimist. 
Btw. I bought during this dip. :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:21:15
Unlike many others I have never had a problem with coinbase. Fees are a little high but I feel like that is due to the ease of use they bring for the everyday average person. 
Binance is good too.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:58:30
Time to strap in. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:10:59
Like a muhfuggin boss
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:08:52
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:20:40
My stomach is dropping with it
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:17:53
Ended up talking to the owner for a while. Very knowledgeable guy.
Exciting to see this in Maryland. Every time I bring up bitcoin no one has any idea what I am talking about... of course, I do live in a redneck county.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:27:19
Lol 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:56:24
Ouch. No. I started in November with just a few hundred. I am down after this latest drop. I used gains during the massive spike to diversify but everything is down now so I am at a loss. I am in this for the long haul so I am not stressed. You shouldn't be either. Even with your current loss. You don't lose anything until you sell. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:22:53
Seriously. Wut dafuq 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:29:42
Okay 
I will keep an eye out and buy then. 
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:52:19
Seriously 
I thought btc was a goner and was stressed the fuck out when all those snakes came out of nowhere. I own a snake and was creeped out at that.... 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:13:59
Thank you. I appreciate your feedback. It was helpful 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:50:18
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:43:31
Oh man
Please prepare yourself for the comments coming your way. 
No matter what your percentage of btc, you always have that amount no matter how high or low the price goes.
It is not a stock. Please take some time to research more.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:52:07
Anyone know how legit bread and their app is?
I can't find a Reddit for them. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:03:41
My way out of financial ruin from a divorce.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:55:06
It's not too late. If you buy now you avoid the ath that some fell prey to back in December. Below 8k is a good time to buy imho. I just grabbed more. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:14:28
I would imagine people that got in around the all-time high. New people that thought that it was going to be a get-rich-quick scheme. People that put way too much of their money into it, taking out loans borrowing money against their house excetera
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:04:43
Congratulations 
That's my goal before the end of the year 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:28:25
No one knows the future.  No one.
But the more you watch and learn the better chance you have to not make a huge mistake. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:21:17
I am pessimistic to this claim
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:24:35
Word not world ?
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:50:59
Yeah,  these were the comments I saw coming. Lol
Unfortunately you need to research like everyone else. But for now, drop that 100 down and get your feet wet 
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:18:39
Still have a ways to go 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:00:34
I like it. I joined up.
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:01:04
For us dumb people.... please explain this
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:00:18
I am holding and I am down 40%
I am not letting go until 0. But I can also be a stubborn dood. I always planned to keep a percentage in crypto forever. Or until I die. Whichever comes first.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:12:56
If we could only time travel. I am having the same problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:09:23
Honestly? No one knows... 
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:27:15
A guy who was financially destroyed in a divorce? ��
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:12:25
Cool 
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:23:00
So if I am to understand this, there will definitely be a dip to around 5.5k?
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:41:21
Ron would hate Bitcoin.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:05:43
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:11:54
She definitely got all my money 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:10:39
Honestly, and I know there will be haters that will have some negative things to say, I think this is actually a very good idea
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:04:47
Done. Good luck with your research project 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:09:38
Eh. My time on Reddit doesn't equate to my knowledge of things. This could be the one, but I have also seen that this has happened before. Either way, I didn't go in for more than I could afford, I believe this is the future, and I planned on staying in for a looong time. I will always keep something in crypto because I believe in it like I said. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:45:23
Seems like a good time to jump on the train. Come on and take a ride with us. Best rollercoaster ever!
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:05:31
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:21:42
Oh yeah
She didn't just destroy me financially. She came after me with a hate I have never seen before. And after leaving me for a friend. Lol
Devastating. But I am still here. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:25:30
Now THAT was funny 
@_date: 2018-02-24 11:24:17
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:39:09
That was a good read
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:06:44
Interesting. Lotta hodlers out there refusing to sell. I am one of them. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:00:25
I will back it
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:08:24
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:39:09
I will look him up 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:45
That's exactly what just happened to me 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:15:21
I am for sure. I am learning more and more each day. Getting emotions in check is key. I am glad I initially experimented with small amounts to get my feet wet 
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:53:16
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:24:01
Eh, I think was just fun/blowing off steam after a lot of red lately. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:50:33
Wait until 5k. It's coming
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:39:30
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:02:04
Very Monty python esque. Loved it 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:43:36
Will check it out
