I called him butthurt because the guy decided to look through my history and made racist comments. Kinda like how you looked through my history to go 'b-but you said butthurt too!!!!! :('
Looks like you completely missed my point. It wasn't the term, it was the way you were using it.
Also, looks like my comment got you fired up enough to look through my history for something out of context to use against me, and got you butthurt :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:30:41
Nah, I was justified because the guy got upset and decided to be racist. In this case, you got upset enough to trawl through my profile. You labeled any dissent as butthurt. Nice try tho, Mr. Butthurt :)

Yeah shorting from the top would probably be more profitable, but my issue with that is that we have no idea if it would suddenly reverse and fuck you over. I prefer to long every dip and short every rise, regardless of uptrend or down - the way I see it, there's a 0% chance of the trend continuing 5ever, and a 100% chance of the trend eventually reversing. So I layer in as it moves against me. The more it moves against me, the more I make on the reaction.
You're right though, most people don't know when to sell, and don't realize that selling whenever you're in profit is a good thing. If you miss your chance to sell in profit because you were waiting for more profit, you've fucked up and the best you can do then is to sell at breakeven. (Tbh I did that with an alt today lol). And yeah that chart is way too clean. Most charts are ridiculous, but usually on the 5m there's a fair amount of entries - for btc anyway.

You don't need to do that. Don't try to predict the future, you won't be right each time, and you will eventually get burned hard. Sell the bounce doesn't mean sell the top, I quite literally mean sell whenever you're in profit. It's not going to go down hard forever and taper off, and on longer timeframes in an uptrend, it will usually bounce back to support levels in a high volume market. (I don't wait for this, of course.)


You don't need to know where it will be tomorrow, you just need to have enough capital prepared for it going down further, and have limits or alerts set for when it goes up.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:55:59
Don't even need to buy it on an uptrend, just sell the bounce each time. Seriously the 'chart' they posted shows so many places they could've gotten out with major profit. It's funny, everyone always says buy the dip but they always forget the important part of sell the bounce.
Nice to see another trader who uses the concept of tuition lol. Luckily I paid mine early on with a small amount, from there on it's been mostly smooth sailing.

It can be pretty interesting. I mean I once saw two people debate whether or not the big bang is real, one of them was a vegan conspiracy theorist (Rothschilds own all the central banks, vaccines are a fraud, GMO's lead to eugenics, etc.) and the other guy was a transhumanist who believed that the human code would one day be open source and modifiable (to which I had to be a degenerate and ask, 'will there be furries')

I'm using the past examples to show to you how it works. They fucked up because as I mentioned in the chart, it's very clearly in chop. ~7k was support, if you look back at the 29th or so. When the price hits support, it either holds and bounces back up, or it crashes through it hard - like it did for the aforementioned drop. That's why I was saying 7k is a good place to put a small amount of size in, because if it were to bounce, you profit, and if it were to move against you, you don't have much of your capital in, so you can scale as it falls down further to bring your average down. I'm not predicting what's going to happen, I know two there are two scenarios, and I take a contrarian approach so that I can profit off of either.
No, you don't necessarily make money by predicting price action. Some people do, and some are very good at it. Props to them, but that's too much gambling for me. I go by defined events in high volume markets. Whenever there's a massive drop past support, there's going to be a bounce. A lot of the time it bounces right back to support, especially on the longer timeframes, but on the shorter timeframes not so much. I know to buy when it breaks support, because it will have a bounce. Again, it's literally never just dropped and tapered off at that level. It always starts to ping pong between the new support and resistance.  It's not a guessing game, it's using events that play out the same in high volume markets.
There is a system in place that lets me profit all the time. Literally the last time I had a loss was a fortnight ago, and it was like, .1%, which I made back in two trades. I trade almost every price action I see, and I've been doing so for the past 5 months. Not a billionaire since I started off with a small stack, but let's just say that while everyone else was upset about their portfolio going down 20%, I was up 18%. It's been 5 days, and I'm up 30% due to the insane volatility.
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:34:23
Nah. Even though I'm making money with each drop, I feel bad for people who are losing right now. They fell so I could prosper :'(
Except for those dumb cunts who unironically get angry at shorters because "they're making money on bitcoin going down!!11!1!!!" and think that trading is just gambling and that it's impossible to prosper in this market, that you should just hodl hodl, and aren't open to new ideas. They can go suck a fuck.

Of course it's not easy, it takes time and effort to learn how to do things properly. Crypto might be easier than regular financial markets, but you still have to put in the time and effort. Like I said, I've already paid my tuition. If you want to make money in this space, you need to follow the advice of professional traders, learn how to read charts, experiment with various techniques, and ultimately find a strategy that works for you. I'm not sharing the entire strategy nor am I giving financial advice in my posts, I'm giving a watered down version which you should look into and base a more complex strategy around. If you want, I could link you to the youtube videos that taught me how to trade well.
As for why people aren't profiting in crypto, that's because they're acting emotionally. They don't have a solid plan or strategy that's ready for things going against them, they got in expecting to make money quickly, and then jump out the moment things go against them, or stay in far too long because they get greedy and want more profits.


They fucked up. Look at the chart, they bought in while the market was in chop. They should've bought at 7k or below, when the price was at support or broke it.


If it dropped down 1k, they should've scaled in and added more to their position, and sold at the bounce. Look at the chart, there was a $300 bounce for a $400 drop below support. If the price went back up to 7.7k (or back to 7k, the support - which it almost did) they would be at decent profit. I wouldn't wait for that though, I would exit out earlier. Again, whenever you're in profit. I personally don't wait more than a few hours since I'm a short term trader (if I'm not out of a trade in 15 minutes, it's not a good position for me) but I know long term traders who wait days to weeks, if necessary. I can't speak for them, but I know that they do fairly well with their strategies. I don't follow the trends, and I try not to predict the future - I'm interested in the here and now, so it doesn't matter if it's showing signs of climbing up to 10k. If you're worried about missing out on that, collect spare BTC as profits from your trades instead of USD, and sell that off when the price pumps. I do that with altcoins. At no point do I make actions on my predictions of the price. Again, nobody can tell the future.


People have thresholds, and it ultimately depends on the type of trading they're doing. For me, a 1% increase is 100% on margin, so I would definitely sell. Margin has its risks though, and it's not for everyone. For a spot trader on a longer timeframe, probably not. Some people use stops, if they have a threshold. As I mentioned, if the price dropped more and more, I would scale, and then sell on the bounce. You don't need to know when it will drop, but if you can read the chart and identify the support, you'll know when to buy during a large drop.

It's funny, I initially got into crypto a second time because I wanted to make money quickly via day trading. Put some chump change (by a teenager's standards) in to various shitcoins on poloniex, some into btc. I took some L's (I didn't know what the fuck I was doing honestly, I just jumped on the bandwagon of whatever was getting shilled on the trollbox, then hopped off at profit) and ultimately stopped when I got a real job soon after.
Fast forward two years, my btc and eth were 10000% higher at peak. feelsgoodman
