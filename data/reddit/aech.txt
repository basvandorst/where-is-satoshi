No shame if you needed needed the money. Some people are here are like, "I sleep on the floor and skip two meals a day but I'm making great gains on crypto! HODL!" 
Its okay to withdraw a bit to have an okay standard of living, even if it means less profit on the future.

Just to echo the other guy, this doesn't mean they have any current plans. Just a smart business move on their part. Now if they ever want to add crypto to their service they have those domains. This protects them from some random person buying those domains and then telling amazon they'll sell it for $100,000 or something. Also can protect them from people buying similar domains and creating fake sites with Amazon's name.

IOTA's wallet is not very user friendly atm, but it doesn't matter because you can't withdraw iota from Binance right now anyways.

If you want to play it safe you could sell one or two shares and use that to buy BTC. Amazon is a safer bet than BTC even if it might not get you as much profit.

We should switch to mBTC as the default unit some point soon. One mBTC is $10. It sounds a lot better to tell someone to buy 10 mBTC than to buy .01 Bitcoins.

Don't worry too much. I fell for it also. I saw all the FUD about Bcash and then saw how much Ethereum was rising and decided to get out of bitcoin and go in on that because I was worried bitcoin would "collapse" or something. And I promise you we're not the only ones who fell for it, there are plenty others who just don't want to admit they made the same mistake. 
It's time for me to buy some and just do my best to forget I even own it for a few years.

Be careful. Those sounds a lot like famous last words

If there's nuclear war then cashing out Bitcoin will be the least of your problems.

You have to apply to have a higher limit and they make you go through extra verification steps

That's pretty much what clued some bigger investors in to the dotcom bubble crash. I forget who said it exactly, but someone said that a taxi driver started giving him tips on which companies to invest in and that's when he knew he needed to get out. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:46
Consider both sides. I've seen people saying they're waiting for the dip since $7000 and I bet they regret not buying in then. Of course they could also be playing the long game and waiting for the crash to bring us below $8000 again. I'm beginning to consider dollar cost averaging at this point, because I can't tell what's going on tbh
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:49
That's precisely the reason it'll crash 50% though. All these new people that bought in the last 4 weeks stand to lose insane gains so they'll sell as soon as they can.

Posting for posterity's sake. We were here when it happened.

Dropped to $9000 and I tried to buy. By the time I was able to buy it was back to $10,000 :/ Oh well. Maybe Coinbase saved me and Bitcoin will continue to drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:51
Just strap in and enjoy the ride

You most likely used Blockchain.info or Bitcoin-QT. Those were the most popular as far as I remember
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:25
I would be if Coinbase was working rn
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:56:22
What do you think it's gonna fall to? I'm thinking it'll fall back to $6000, about the price it was before all this skyrocketing began.

Is there anything Bitcoin can do to mitigate this risk? I get the same anxiety about sending pretty much any amount of bitcoin. I always double and triple check the first four and last four digits of the address and if I'm sending a bigger amount I'll double check the whole thing, just in case. But there will always be someone who accidentally sends it to the wrong address and then blames it on Bitcoin and refuse to say its their fault. It's like George Carlin says, "Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.” People will fuck it up and they will not accept responsibility. 
I saw a new coin, I forget its name, that allowed for aliases for addresses which would be easier to type than a whole address, but it still doesn't solve the problem. If you accidentally type the wrong alias, then its gone. No take backs.

Everyone was predicting a crash when it hit 10k and that didn't happen. Be wary when trying to predict what its going to do.

Well I think yes and no. I'm not sure whether to call is a fault or not. Part of Bitcoin's purpose is to put people in control of their own money. Being in control comes with risks like this though, which is probably part of the reason the institutions we have that protect transactions today came into being. There's only so much a decentralized system can do to protect the people using it, without compromising it's decentralized nature. So it's a fault of the system, but also part of it's own design. 
It's certainly a tough problem to solve. I think it's completely insufficient for people to say that people will learn to be careful with addresses from their mistakes. What if a random person is trying to send hundreds of dollars and that's when they accidentally send it to the wrong place? That's an expensive mistake that we shouldn't just accept as part of the system. Sure, they *should* have double checked when sending a large sum of money, but maybe they always double check and then, just one time, they were in a hurry and forgot to. People make mistakes. 
A counter argument is that that person's mistake is just a casualty of the system that affords us more privacy control of our money. As far as i can tell, it just boils down to a choice between control over money or protection of money. I'm not sure both are possible in one system.

We're just bouncing between walls now. I wonder which one it will break through first.

My attempts at buying ethereum at $400 and Bitcoin at $9000 both failed conveniently. Not only is it their job to stay up during these volatile times, but its the most important time for them to be up.

Taxi drivers giving investing advice is literally a defining hallmark of the dotcom bubble. If there has ever been a time to be cautious, it's now.

Bitcoin actually isn't the most secure, easiest, or fastest way to transfer wealth anymore. There are other coins for that. Bitcoin's main uses right now are store of value and entry points for other coins. It holds it's value because of its branding. It'll be the main point of entry into crypto for a very long time, and for that reason alone it will hold its value.

Reminds me of the story of Joseph Kennedy. It starts with Joseph Kennedy on his way to work. He's a little early so he decided to stop and get his shoe's shined. When finishing up, the boy shining his shoes told him to, "Buy Hindenberg." 
Joseph Kennedy sold everything he had soon after that because, "It's time to sell when the shoe shine boy is giving you stock tips."
I'm not saying a crash is inevitable, but its time to be more careful.
