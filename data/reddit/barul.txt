Yeah but you aren't necessarily verified enough to use GDAX. In my case I'm just verified enough to use Coinbase to buy BTC and their other cryptos, but on GDAX I need to complete the 2nd step (which I've tried numerous times and failed each time).
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:54:40
Don't you need to be verified on GDAX to do that though?

It's still the fastest way to buy for people who aren't registered/verified on an exchange, unfortunately.

I did manage to only get the first verification, the one which lets me buy w/ my card. I must've tried at least 15 times to get the 2nd step (which allows to fully use GDAX), it failed every time.

TBH even if the delay is crazy long at least it reassures me that people are getting verified.
It means I've got a change to be able to not use Coinbase anymore.

This freaking kid. The more I look at the faces the more I laugh. Every time.

Looks like some pasta you can microwave

It works well most of the time, but sometimes it says I've got 0BTC in my balance… Bit worrying when it happens.

I feel so much better since I started thinking about it like that.

Wasn't he talking about BCH though?

I've seen the "hodl" several times before, why isn't it "hold"? I'm assuming there's a joke behind it that I don't get

This is exactly what I do. I just started to buy BTC but I needed something to stay reasonable, so that's where my BTC budget is from.

I think HODLing is just not selling all your coins following general panic.
Nothing's preventing you from using it to buy stuff

Not sure if it's been asked already, but with this release is there any chance Coinbase implements SegWit?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:22:47
Hey easy now, let me invest some more before it reaches that, I only recently started.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:07:33
8 years ago I laughed at people believing in BTC. They were so damn stupid for believing in something like that.
Biggest mistake of my life.

Thank you so much for the source it's so funny :-D
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:53:04
I second this, it took me nearly a month to be verified but they seem to be a reputable exchange, and you can buy via credit card too.

The source for hodl is [this topic]( on bitcointalk.
