Torn. On one hand I feel sensationalist journalism, because truth is so irrelevant, should just be ignored. On the other hand, someone (everyone) should let this one know she's party to both a foul and harm. Upvote.

Well, addressed by everyone except Gox apparently.

The job of journalists is, in large part, to write for rubberneckers, and MtGox was a hell of a car crash. As soon as some other financial crisis spins out of control, they'll swing back to singing bitcoin's praises. Or they could set up bitcoin micropayments to get rid of their stupid paywall that prevents most of us from even seeing what you're talking about, and let readers vote with their wallets. Hmmm.

Patience, not pugilism. Please. There is no contest here. No medal to be awarded. The Bloomberg news anchors and the professor are clearly under-informed and doing their best to entertain viewers more titillated by an argument and fear than a discussion about the strength and efficacy of an alternative to fiat currencies. They are just doing what they are paid to do. Watching Einstein fight with his wife would have been just as uncomfortable. The problem is in the watching and the watchers.

Great idea!

Nicely done, sir. Seriously, though: Thank you for all you do. I've learned a great deal from your talks, appearances and posts, and appreciate your level-headed advocacy. Headed out now to buy an Android phone. Ciao.

Just made my first purchase a couple of days ago. It was incredibly easy and the chat customer service person did an outstanding job answering all my noob questions in real time while I completed the transaction. I will definitely return.

Anyone know the map app shown in the movie a couple of times that indicates bitcoin penetration with colored light columns?

Referring to readers/watchers of sensationalist or yellow journalism. Same as the people who are drawn to look at car accidents, etc.

Used as a monetary system, Bitcoin will be stable. Played in a casino like nasdaq or nyse or any other exchange riding waves of nanosecond trades driven by algorithms, and armies of speculative day-traders, it's going to be volatile. Great news for Bitcoin: it can't go out of business and/or declare bankruptcy and ask for a bailout. Humans don't run it. It's a secure, stable, electronic architecture free from human corruption and foible.

OR, 25 cents worth of Bitcoin for free. Millionaires always move money for free through the banks. Those with little or none are right over the barrel and pay pay pay for every little thing. The banks don't want customers, just cash and debtors. I'm seeing way too much focus on rich investors and get rich quick schemes in recent posts. Lately, r/bitcoin seems to have forgotten that Bitcoin is a great tool for those with less. Be your own bank! That's the point.

That's a great article. I'm not sure, except for initial mine and sell cycle, if Bitcoin should be compared to commodities. Onion price variations are nicely tied to weather, supply/demand, etc. Besides political and monetary specific issues (e.g. Cyprus) there are fewer "natural" movers of Bitcoin price. Still, it's an interesting point. Thanks for the link.
