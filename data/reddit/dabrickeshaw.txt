All I can think when I see comments like this is the “this is fine” dog

This is so cute! Watching redditors humblebrag to each other about how financially savvy they are. Can’t believe those le noobs sold at 11 and bought at 19? It’s like they have no clue wut they r doin amirite

Thank you.

So if I say things like hodl and .005231 BTC enough will I eventually become cool enough to join your clan?

I mean how could it? As long as profits are 1000% per day people will keep pumping their cash in until there’s none left. Should go up like this forever basically!

Hmm, I’m having a tough time figuring out who to believe here. One of the most renowned economists of the past generation, maybe even century, or a random redditor who won’t respond to the plethora of issues rampant in his bitcoin manifesto. 
I’ll go with the random redditor! What could go wrong!

Whew, for a second I thought the American university system was just a profit racket! Thanks for clearing it up

And those technology things worked out so we got nuthin to worry about rite???

Well if we’re being pedantic, you’re absolutely correct. It’s not bitcoin itself, just some of the currencies biggest players and their highly questionable trading tactics. I’m sure that’ll quell any hesitation the average laymen might have in relation to fraud or scams

People who say shit like this have never experienced the fear lawlessness invokes
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:49:01
Well if fuckurprivacy says so then it must be that way
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:54:24
Right. And BTC is all flowers and rainbows, not currently subject to an US justice department investigation for price fixing or anything. Totally not scammy

The lands will be barren and wasted with nothing left to eat or do and the HODLers will still be circlejerking bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:39:13
It's funny to see the two sides of bitcoin stomp and scream at each other yelling "FRAUD" or "SCAM" louder and louder at each possible junction. Really, quite entertaining from a disinterested observer

“this is fine”
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:50:03
Ahhh, I see the whataboutism is still very strong in this sub. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:30:28
Logic was never a strong suit of this sub

Are you asserting that those securities are regulated in the same way as bitcoin?
