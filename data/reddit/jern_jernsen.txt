Enter Vertcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:20
Only those who bought during this madness. I'm as bullish as anyone on bitcoin but if this doesnt scream bubble then nothing ever will
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:51:26
Don’t forget about their Gemini income
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:50:23
Is it open source? How can we implement it on alt coins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:07
This has become sickening. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:47:09
Trade for Monero and they are clean
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:48
was it not?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:59
So was it an inside job?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:37:26
Vtc is literally designed only for consumer hardware. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:27
Bitcoin.org is the real site 
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:32:55
They provide a service and you don't have to use it. But you do, because you want your money to be secure and accessible. 
This is an analogy for a 14 year old. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:02:21
Of course they are.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:32:34
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:05:27
lol if you think altcoins don't have their own value propositions. Do 5 minutes of research outside of this echo chamber and you'll learn about them.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:43:47
Vertcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:50:10
You are in the wrong coin if you believe that. Vertcoin is where you belong. "The people's coin"
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:44:49

That's the best video I've seen. Bookmarking to send to people when I get put on the spot.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:38:48
Haven't you heard about the dippening?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:34:54
This run up is FOMO. Expect a significant correction shortly. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:30:26
It didn't occur to me that they subcontract their fabrication. Makes sense- TIL
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:16:46
They announced the same thing before coinbase did.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:43:48
Takes 10 seconds to look it up on their blog.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:55:00
Engineers don't make them either

South island is beautiful in its own way. Others here have described it accurately. Milford Sound is something that cannot be described in pictures or words. You must see it.

You're saying the pig isn't fat enough to slaughter yet.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:32:49
Or by people who understand this could very well (and likely is) bullshit and to applaud it would be to encourage more shady behavior when we need to be stamping it out before the mass adoption phase arrives. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:39:05
Visited your country in February on honeymoon. Started in Auckland and made it all the way down to Queenstown but not quite this far south. Hopefully your government eases up on crypto so you guys can help lead the movement.  
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:25:30
Where are you seeing their bank account balance? We are taking the law firm's word that Tether's word is good. If anything this should be trusted less than what we've known before today when we heard it directly from Tether. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:00:57
Because they help his agenda of course.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:27:56
This is no better than Tether themselves saying they are fully-backed. This just adds another party who they paid to say the same thing.
To end the FUD we need a neutral party to audit them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:04:56
Source? You account for mining?
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:56:33
This is what I do with excel because I'm a fucking savage and cannot write proper code.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:05
Its how most people learn about bitcoin and it is their first wallet. There are many many other cheaper, and arguably better places to buy and store your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:47:06
Obviously. The original post was just a sentiment about how far we have come.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:52:26
Some of it is personal preference. Some of it is where you are located. 
Speaking as an American, I use Gemini and love it. Coinbase is a fine service but can be more expensive. GDAX is the engine behind Coinbase. You can register there directly and save on the middleman fees. It's also a great service.
There is also Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, etc. I have no experience with them. You can search this sub but I would be hesitant.
All of the above have their fair share of outages from the incredible growth in users during peak times. You will see conspiracy theories about how they go down on purpose to manipulate profits.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:32:37
It doesn’t claim to be anonymous 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:32:04
Vertcoin is the answer. Distribute the work.
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:32:22
He's right though.
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:02:33
Yeah, it’s called Vertcoin and ASIC resistance. While not perfect it’s a hell of a lot more decentralized and democratized than BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:56:42
Oh yeah it’s active. The DCI was busy in Silicon Valley giving talks this month. They talked at Stanford too. Tadge Dryja one of the coauthors of the original paper is leading it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:30:41
Why is that? It would mean I am never subject to malicious installs right?
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:17:47
James the Vertcoin lead dev had an interesting presentation. They are in the early stages of building and selling a hardware product called the litbox. An all in one “crypto box”.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:01:36
I am really excited about this. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:27:07
Did you know there is a 4th implementation called lit?
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:01:30
I agree that's ideal, but whats the on ramp? How do you get BTC?
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:34:52
But it would require the thief to have physical access to the device at some point right?
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:01:25
Could you explain watch towers?
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:59:20
What exactly are watch towers?
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:44:42
I just plan to never update the thing. Is that a good idea?
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:13:28
Thank you for the information. I will follow Ledger's instructions. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:41:56
They recorded the little talk he gave.
But basically it’s a LN node using the lit implementation (the one done by Tadge Dryja and the DCI). It will also serve point of sale software, personal wallets, payment clients, and maybe mining software. It’s in early development. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:10:41
That’s what the title says?
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:13:20
GPU mine Vertcoin and convert to BTC if you want 
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:21:44
They're thinking not many atms exist and they can get away with it. They aren't running a charity 
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:53:57
Why do you think it won’t be BOLT compliant? Afaik it will be.
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:52:45
I understand what its function is. I want to know how it does it. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:52:13
Do you know if bittrex is making a market?
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:51:11
I’ve been searching for this too. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:42:33
They roll their eyes til you show them the usd balance. Then they want you to cash out 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:17:16
Capitalism baby
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:28:52
This has been known since the dark ages. It's why Vertcoin was invented. I'm making good profit with GPUs.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:46:28
Yep 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:00:20
Right? It has nothing to do with bitcoin. Personal finance has been around for centuries.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:39:52
What's the ATH?
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:16:24
Arbitrary trend line?
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:47:57
Name one coin that pledges asic resistance (not a byproduct)
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:28:11
LITbox is exactly the product you need.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:27:50
Yes! So exciting.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:58:43
You must be loaded. I see you giving coins away all over this sub. Let us know if you are feeling it today lol
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:31:01
Vertcoin. It's ASIC resistant. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:51:44
Except the ones where they keep peoples money. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:40:07
That's disingenuous. Look around you and speak for yourself. Big gubmint isn't out to get you.
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:55:31
Leave this mess and join vertcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-08 21:26:11
You are effectively making the case against bitcoin. ASIC resistant coins are the way to go.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:02:38
Clever if factual.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:10:09
It's been done. It's an asic resistant fork with Segwit called vertcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:28:27
Surprised I had to scroll this far. I think this sub is toxic. Used to love it but politics has changed it completely. That old spirit of crypto has moved to the alts. That said, the fights BTC has are necessary and they are blazing the trail for others.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:55:26
I don't know of any one source. is typically unbiased but you need to dig a lot deeper to learn about each coin. I've just gathered info over the years from the various subs and if something caught my eye I did more research. You eventually get a feel for what most projects are trying to achieve and you'll start forming your own opinions. 
Another method is sorting all coins by market cap and researching down the line. Shitcoins are pretty easy to sift out. With some of the smaller coins you can get as thorough as joining the dev group's public chat room and speak directly with the devs, as I've done with Vertcoin and hence I believe in it so much because I know exactly what the motives, road map, and progress is. Of course that isn't unbiased, but it is info directly from the source.
Or you can always mine whatever is most profitable and convert to bitcoin or your coin of choice. Good luck ��
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:08:34
Yep! Those poor GPUs. They need an advocacy group. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:03:38
So it'll be BTC and what's the new one called?
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:14:10
I'm a GPU miner and this made me laugh 
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:34:54
Vertcoin is ASIC resistant. I hate to shill but people are actually looking for answers. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:59:54
That the SEC has saved zero people from scams like these, and that they don't exist to prevent them. Or maybe you do truly believe that. This is bitcoin after all. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:41:32
My alt coin would fork the day an ASIC was discovered so that scenario cannot happen. I understand the position you are in and I empathize but I don't think it has to result in a toxic subreddit. Public discourse is one thing. Infighting and unnecessary drama is another. I rarely see talk about the actual tech on here anymore. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:53:42
bread wallet is excellent
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:16:37
ASIC resistance doesn't aim to keep big entities from having large scale GPU operations. It aims to lower the entry bar for everyone else and spread it around.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:16:45
It's not free. Nobody is getting free money. There is no such thing as free money. There will be an equilibrium. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:38:35
LTC roadmap lists Vertcoin as the first test subject for chain swaps. Do you know if this is still the plan?
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:21:59
So segwit 2x is now guaranteed to happen?
Thanks for helping me understand.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:09:08
Bonus points for slick marketing and buzz words. Oh and a minimally viable white paper.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:20:51
Implying there is a repeating pattern.
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:44:13
Starting to think the rational folks moved to ETH or other alts. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:20:06
It correlates weakly if at all. I don't think anyone knows how it correlates. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:36:52
That's where I first saw it in 2012-13. Some guy said he made like 50 grand off a small investment. My eyes opened wide and I was mining a month later. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:31:39
No. For that you'd need an asic resistant coin like Vertcoin
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:15:55
I said that in jest.
I'm invested in BTC but diversified in other coins that I think will be in the big picture 10 years later. I do think BTC will play the role of at a minimum a gold standard store of value, and at best it'll be able to serve 80%+ of the use cases. It's your option  of somewhere in the middle IMO
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:28:02
I switched to Gemini a month ago and haven't looked back. Not a hiccup with them yet. Verified in 3 days.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:02:34
Now is a good time. Fear is at a high. Though in a few weeks it could be better. Keep track of the news
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:39:46
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:48:42
I've managed to dodge scams so far. Had money in cryptsy and havelock investments. Thankfully there are more credible choices now 
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:16:00
Or saving people from scams. This is necessary. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:19:23
I only hold BTC and VTC. I'm just growing tired of the community here.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:23:10
Because crypto adoption will continue to moon and BTC won't be able to handle the volume. Market share will continue to drop and before you know it BTC is a niche alt coin. 
If Ford Motors decided to wait 20 years to upgrade their Model T, then they would have fallen behind and would not exist today.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:55:38
They don't care about what happens between getting out of fiat and getting back into it.
If you entered with 2500 and exited with 2600 then you are taxed on 100. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:53:42
If he was a fool he would have sold long ago.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:24:39
An underground niche of people in a general population would do that voluntarily.  Most people just don't care and certainly wouldn't go out of their way. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:26:55
Caught the knife at 2205. Calling bottom!
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:01:36
That's not sustainable imo 
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:13:51
Mine Vertcoin with GPUs if you really want to be profitable. Buying ASICs is too risky. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:20:36
VTC is asic resistant and Segwit activated if you're looking for an alternative. And already has LN
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:51:38
It would redirect me to the wiki page about the history of the downfall of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:03:07
Why not use something that you know is reputable? Great way to get scammed.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:49:30
I think it will closer to August. Somewhere around $1000 wouldn't surprise me at all. I'll buy then, too. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:01:32
All the comments here are promoting conspiracy theories. Is this a joke post or am I waking up to the realization that this community is comprised of tin foil hats? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:08:49
Don't make that parallel. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:54:34
I prefer calling it the One in a Million club. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:54:37
Probably. And that's why I don't day trade. I only try to time a dip when I was already going to buy anyway in hopes of squeezing a little extra out of the tube.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:02:19
Gemini has been perfect.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:45:16
Agreed. VTC is what I wish BTC turned out to be. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:21:24
No. Where's the incentive to mine?
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:27:07
This is a very naive stance on cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:29:22
How would you not make more money just buying ETH? Your ROI is dependent on the price of ETH rising.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:54:18
Literally a pyramid scheme. I lol every time someone thinks of this "novel" idea.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:38:01
Vertcoin is ASIC resistant.
Imagine Achilles with high top boots. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:02:00
Right? This is why we can't have widespread crypto yet.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:25:13
Using that metric you assume that your pain threshold never changes. idk about you but I grow numb to all the crashes over time. Dropping $500 used to affect me but now I don't care at all. I gauge it by changing the subreddits to /new and categorizing the posts by fear or greed. There have been a lot of scared noobs lately.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:55:52
I read it as he has 5 figures of fiat in BTC holdings currently. So he is sitting on $10,000. Not crazy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:01:37
If there was a window for arbitrage that was commonly known, then don't you think people would have taken advantage of it long ago? There are no opportunities for arbitrage unless you have insider contacts.
