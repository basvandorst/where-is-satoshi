How much money is out there that people don't know what to do with
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:55:46
I don't know what moves the price so I cannot be more specific
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:02:59
Gold or a bitcoin   Gold or a bitcoin     Gold or a bitcoin 
Hmmmmmmmm.......... 
Tough choice
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:00:22
until it breaks. shows how weak bitcoin or any crypto truly is
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:12:39
Gold much shinier (All bitcoin portrayed as a gold coin) coincidence??
I think not
Did you read where the jews took all the bitcoin from egypt when they left egypt

Saying what everyone wants to hear. Great
or maybe what is happening to Bcash is a warning to bitcoin hodlers
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:34:10
when the whale hodlers determine its time to sell. The random not filthy rich holders who are 40% of the bitcoin owners stand no chance
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:00
It shows the roots of crypto in general is very mysterious and a fued can crash it
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:59:11
If you believe in the bible its a very logical thought. But you probably believe in the big bang. (which is fine) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:47:36
So what you are saying is that even the most adamant HODLers are really in it just to make more fiat currency so they can eat fancy dinners and fancy cars?
I disagree to some extent as bitcoin is at least worth the market shares of all money transfer companies Western union moneygram etc
 we have yet to see contract payments using bitcoin and whether they will be as safe as paypal and amex so leave those players out for now
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:27:46
As I understand the logic is that once bitcoin reaches "X" amount in price everyone perceives that as recognition that bitcoin will at one time or another be worth that price. Therefore if the price declines it will spur a rush which will raise the price once again. Therefore there is no sense of urgency among current holders.
I believe that Gold and silver are ingrained from God to be stores of value. you might say i am a nut to believe this but i really do. I have a hard time believing that these sentiments ingrained either from god or thousands of years of acceptance by mankind can be replaced so easily irregardless of how much the internet revolutionized our lives these past 20 years.   
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:10:51
Well that is your opinion. It could be because im jewish but Gold gives me a fuzzy feeling inside and if it wasn't worth anything I would definitely build my house out of it. 
Some white gold there some rose Gold there BAM
maybe a yellow gold sink?

We have seen a dip to 6k a month and a half ago then a rebound to 11k before stabilizing at a 8k-9k range. An asset like Bitcoin can not stay in a range without the inevitable shift. The shift will be an upwards shift because there seems to be no downwards force strong enough to sustain a large downwards move, so the shift will be upwards. since there is no bitcoin mania 2.0 the shift cannot exceed a previous holding point which means 11k is the max.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:00:46
that's fair although we will see 11k sooner
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:44:27
I predicted a movement and stated
" The shift will be an upwards shift because there seems to be no downwards force strong enough to sustain a large downwards move"
But i was wrong
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:54:33
Its clear as day, Computers are emotionless and great record keepers what could be better then that for money which is just a ledger system. Include the fact that governments have screwed up regular money and you have a winner. The first and most trusted crypto currency will be hailed king and that is bitcoin. just wait until all the shitcoins fail.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:48:38
It is the perfect money. Satoshi knows, what can beat it?
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:15:25
3 for 3
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:59:16
That helps my point as bitcoin is proven to be safe and easily transferable 
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:26:08
When did the first contracts expire? And who is betting on bitcoin to fulfill these contracts? They were massacred so far.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:59:49
There is predicting the price and seeing great value in the product
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:23:26
How are other cryptos not collapsing?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:17:51
Because of the protection the commodity offers against a looming recession. Buy gold as well its just as good but less practical. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:16:25
5 years is delusional we can be 50 years away from a crash of those proportions. Regardless that is the point. Satoshi saw the fatal flaw in 2008 of our financial system and created a product that can fix it. The new gold standard.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:55:08
your blind if you cant see it
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:33:40
Im wondering why they are not hit harder
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:09:53
Below 6k has just been reached. I thought 6k would hold. Have friends who lost 10k plus so far.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:07:05
Its not a scam like bitconnect and all over you see warning to invest what you can afford
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:23:17
Actually I advised someone from a month back that his 6k price target to buy wasn't unrealistic and it did happen for about 5 hours or so.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:00:35
loyalty? Its an investment.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:27:55
I don't see why Tethers collapse would affect Bitcoins price. Whoever holds Tether will be fucked.
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:47:26
amazing work!
