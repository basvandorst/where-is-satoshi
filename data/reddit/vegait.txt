I withdrawn a large (not that large as OP but still large) amount recently, it took 9 days for them to send, but they did, so that's something.

Now, that's not fair. My 7 jan SEPA withdrawal hasn't arrived yet.

Just got an SMS from my bank, my withdrawal arrived from Gox.
If they can send a hundred more like this, we'd be done. :)

I believe that MtGox is incompetent. But no way they dont notice 750k Bitcoin slowly disappearing over a long period of time. That would be a level of incompetence that is reserved for politicans.

I'm so happy I claimed a few hundred BTC....and 1 EUR that I had on my account. As this is not a BTC only claim, I have to wait some more. :)

What gave you the idea I don't understand that? That's why I hope my withdraws to be speedier. The avarage queue wait is 4+ weeks, now it should be only 2. :)

I did it with two bank accounts. The first time I only checked back a week later, and it was done, the second time it was two days.
But you can never know what you can expect from them. My brother waiting to get his account validated for a month now.

That's USD withdrawals. I requested two SEPA withdrawals so far, one took 4 weeks, the second one 3. Also a few weeks ago they said that their bank doubled their SEPA transaction limit.
But I'm about to test it, I was planning to withdraw some EUR tomorrow.

Great. Now, can I get my EUR that I withdrawn three weeks ago?
