Statistics show that around a third of people who win millions are worse off financially three years later than before they won. A lot of people also get estranged from their families, fall into drug addictions etc. Wealth is a mindset, just giving someone money doesn't automatically teach them how to use it responsibly.

You also expose your *private* keys to more software. Which, depending on how paranoid you want to be, is also a risk. And for 40k BTC I'd personally err on the side of being pretty fucking paranoid.

More importantly, it being centralized wouldn't be much of a problem. It's not supposed to be a permanent store of value, nor an integral part of the network.

Two things you should keep in mind:
Never invest more than you're willing to lose. Speculation is still basically gambling, although the odds are much better than at the craps table. With bitcoin, basically the longer you're willing to stay in for, the better your chance of a profit. (Or at least that has been the result so far, who knows what'll happen in the future.)
Secondly: BTC has been getting a lot of attention lately and gone up a lot. Typically huge spikes are followed by big (temporary) crashes. I'm 100% certain the same will happen this time too, but WHEN, and from/to what value is impossible to say. It may "crash" from $10k down to higher than where we are now. Or it may go from $5k down to $2000.
Just be aware that no investment moves in a straight line, and the people who bought at the previous all-time-high (ATH) had to wait a while before getting their money's worth back. (The people who bought high and sold after the crash because they got cold feet obviously never got their money back, so don't do that.)

The name "Linux" is in fact an owned trademark. "Bitcoin" OTOH is purposefully not trademarked nor can it be at this point, as it is a term in common usage. You can however trademark names that have the word "Bitcoin" in them.

Sure, and it's a complex issue. The key issue though is that once large group of customers have settled on a product/service they are reasonably happy with, trying to "convert" them by offering almost exactly the same service with small improvements is a DOA strategy, and that's something a LOT of small businesses do wrong. And it varies between product types, some have very strong loyalty while others are basically commodities and you don't care who's selling it.
You see this a lot in programming languages too. "But we're just like language X but with better features! Why won't everyone instantly convert to our language despite it lagging 10 years behind in libraries, documentation, existing software, expertise, courses, frameworks, developer investment and compiler maturity??"

Seriously, I'm not entirely convinced this was even the top. It looks more like the "first bullrun" part of the crash curve to me. It didn't rise high enough or crash hard enough to kill all optimism and hope of bouncing back, which is what a bubble needs to truly be considered "popped".

You (as the average user) most likely won't have to do anything. The best thing you can do is to make sure whatever software you're using is kept up-to-date. Exchanges will probably stay on top of things for you - however it's *generally* not recommended to keep large amounts on exchanges in any case.
Short version of what's going on: There's currently a big argument about a potential improvement to the protocol (that's the BIP). But with Bitcoin being decentralized nobody can force such an upgrade on everyone else, and since some people stand to lose from this update you can imagine there's a bit of messy politics involved. Right now people are trying to force the impasse to end one way or the other on August 1st, and that's what UASF is.
Regardless of outcome though, your existing coins in your wallet are perfectly safe. The soft fork (if it happens) only affects transactions in the future, not ones that have already been carried out.

Schiff was one of the few people who publicly and repeatedly predicted the financial crisis, and many of his analyses of WHY it happened were pretty spot on. His track record after that isn't anything spectacular though as he was in the hyperinflation camp for a long time.

No, according to the laws of thermodynamics, all the energy you put in will be EXACTLY the same amount you extract in heat, unless you draw it out in a more useful form first (like physical work.)

Why would anyone trust the dinosaur media for bitcoin advice.

No, you don't use up energy on internal processes, you only convert it to heat. You have to actually move the energy out of the system (eg. your muscles moving external objects) for the energy to go anywhere else. And even then it turns into to heat eventually, just somewhere else.

Buy high, then buy higher!

[Bikeshedding]( The amount of attention any issue gets is inversely proportional to how difficult it is to understand it.

Price goes up. People see price go up. People expect price to continue to go up. More people buy. Price goes up more.

Let me know when you can send infinitely divisible beanie babies across the internet while at the same time mathematically guaranteeing that nobody can ever produce more of them.

Yeah pretty much lol.

Yes funny how timing the market perfectly in hindsight is always a good decision.

Wait, so there are viruses that auto-detect BTC addresses in the clipboard?
Well that's actually pretty clever.

I guess a better statement would have been "none have lasted longer than X years".

He's saying if the output is the same, does it matter whether it skipped work? Or does it skip doing work in a way that's harmful to the blockchain?
Not taking a position either way here, just clarifying his question (possibly.)

Buy now! At our super special price, only 2,999.95!
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:52:36
Pretty big risk. Then again if it works out you get to sell your coins and keep them too.

Since we're using arbitrary units: the price of one ton of gold is really excluding the masses from ever owning one!

Pretty sure this is a "correction" by any reasonable definition. I wouldn't call it a crash though, at least not yet.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:48:44
It goes up and down in price.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:04:02
I'm not convinced the final spike is here yet, but I agree. This would be a good time to quietly start selling off small chunks as it seems very likely we will see lower prices in the future. HODLing is also fine but I don't think this is a good place to buy.

Buy the rumor, sell the news.

He was fake news before it was cool.

Long-term fundamental trends get lost in short-term noise. But they become visible over time when you plot the average.

They missed an opportunity by making it 20bf instead of 20**bc**.

No worries, my response was equally douchey :) And really could apply to five other comments in the thread, I just picked yours at random.

True - if you're tracking the Jihan chain.
