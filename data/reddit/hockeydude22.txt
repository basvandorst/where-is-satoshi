I'm going to try and give your story as many eyeballs as possible.  
In fact, I just created this video exposing the truth about Bitcoin exchanges - 
Please share if you think it's helpful.

I'd love it if people would actually read the post before down voting or making negative comments! :-)

I'll be in Iceland right after this happens. Hopefully I'll be able to get my hands on some of this. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:00:24
I agree with everything you said... I actually wrote this post for non-Bitcoin savvy folks who've heard the BS about how Apple Pay is going to kill Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:01:08
spot on!
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:42:09
pretty insane!
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:46:02
Good analogy

I recently started looking into buying gold and silver with Bitcoin, and tested purchasing from a few different companies. 
So far I've ordered from Provident twice and had good results. I've also ordered from Amagi Metals who I wouldn't recommend because it seems like they never have silver stock. It took me over a month to receive from Amagi, where Provident has always arrived in a few days with no issues.

The most important thing in any trade is that you "truly accept the risk on the trade".  This means you have to be comfortable with ANYTHING happening while you're in the trade.  
In stock trading, you can use stops to protect your downside.  In BitCoin, there is no protection.  That's why in my first blog post, I said you MUST meet these criteria if you're going to "buy and hope" BitCoin goes up - 
I'm comfortable with my short-term trades because I know my mental stop out levels.  And I accept that my longer-term positions are extremely risky and I'm comfortable losing 100% of my investment.  That's why it's important NOT to trade with money you aren't comfortable losing.  And it's exactly why everyone's buying high and selling low - the exact opposite of what we should all be doing. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:23:07
ya I've heard success and horror stories from all the exchanges, so playing as conservatively as possible until I gain more confidence in some of these companies. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:19:03
I had to give your gif a shoutout in my video where I explain WHY this is happening to you - 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:47:50
well, I'm still searching for good execution tools.  Bitcoin is waaaaay slower than anything else I trade, and the execution fills suck.  For now I've just been using "trusted" places to like coinbase and quickly moving profits to offline wallets.  I've been using tradingviews.com and bitcoinwisdom.com for charting.  I'm definitely open to any recommendations!

Believe it or not, it's waaaaay easier to read the emotion in price with something as volatile as BTC compared to markets like FOREX that are dominated with computer algo's. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:27:37
Obviously you were way too lazy to read my blog posts where I pleaded for people NOT to buy above $1,000. And you probably missed when I called exactly what price MtGox was going to crash to yesterday and why I was waiting to buy until this morning. And you probably also missed how I made over 20% on my money in less than 24 hours. 
"Buy low, sell high" is an incredibly obvious cliche, but hardly anybody actually follows it. 
But yes, all my content was pure spam. It's people like you that will never see value in someone really trying to help. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:16:48
GraciAss :-)
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:46:58
Years of practice and thousands of hours of live market experience. It's not easy. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:02:11
Thanks for your comments. I gotta catch my breath from these 3 predictions before I jump into the next! Lol
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:07:42
Over 90% of people lose money day trading.  I completely agree that if you try trading without a TON of practice you'll lose.  Here's a video on that very topic - 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:10:56
do a YouTube search for "how to day trade" and you'll see my videos at the top. I've got a 20+ video series that'll show you everything you need to get started. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:04:04
Thanks man

I think it's virutally impossible to know where the market is going to bottom out.  All it takes is one news piece to scare the market down 10%-50%.  That's why I'm starting to scale in for a longer-term position around $650, and will add if price goes lower (so long as I still believe that Bitcoin will have mass adoption).  
In the meantime, I'll still look for short-term moves in addition to my long-term investment thesis.  
This is my thought on buying for long-term - 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:19:41
That's why we have a lil somethin' called "risk management".  Gambling is random with no discipline.  Trading is understand the odds, and being able to manage risk.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:52:10
You questioned what value my post had. I demonstrated why most people lose money, and gave examples of the wrong and right way to do it. I even provided real-time proof that I know what I'm talking about. 
Unlike penny stock pumpers, I have nothing to gain from helping people save money by not making emotional investment decisions. 
Yet trolls like you still want to argue useless points. My best advice for you? Leave the financial markets to the grown ups. :-)
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:11:12
for day trading bitcoin, stocks, futures, or forex? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:09:08
I'm not saying technical analysis is the magic tool.  It's just a way to try to make sense of price action.  Reading psychology behind price action is way more important.  I'm trying to keep people from being sheep.  Go troll somewhere else. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:51:29
if only people actually followed that model... but they continue to do the exact opposite. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:50:06
Thanks Super-Horse!
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:54:42
Any time!
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:53:59
Speculating on Bitcoin is waaaay riskier than proven short-term trades based on probabilities. Glad I know where Reddit's head is at on this stuff. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:16:29
Thanks.  Ya, it looks like every "panic" in price gets met with immediate demand.  I was looking to see if price could crack down to $600's today to scale in a little more, but patience is the key for my long-term positions.  
I gotta say - as a day trader, bitcoins are really easy to trade right now because there's so much "dumb money" moving it.  I doubt that'll last long once the institutions get in on the game. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:49:03
luck eh?  Ya, precision trading with pre-defined entry, targets, and stops with Fibonacci extension measurements is PURE LUCK.  
I guess I've also been lucky in the 12+ years professionally trading stocks and futures too...
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:55:56
Source for that 90% stat?  Over 12 years of trading experience and talking to 10's of thousands of traders over the years. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:18:22
Of course nobody can predict what news is going to happen.  But what IS predictable is how people will react to certain price levels.  That's how I've made my living for years.

"Governments haven't played their hands yet. It is not surprising to me to see a huge dip after one does. Now we wait for other relevant governments to weigh in."
I agree... If Baidu's announcement can assist in sending prices crashing 30%+, just think what major Government announcements will do. 
This is definitely going to be a WILD ride!
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:12:01
Great explanation! 
The current charting and execution tools leave a lot to be desired, but bitcoinwisdom at least gives us the basics. 
I'm working with some startups in Austin, TX that are working on some tools to make trading BTC quicker and executions more reliable. Some cool stuff in the works!
