Ok, I have had enough of this shit! What is its intrinsic value? Let me spell it out for you. 
Intrinsic Value (finance): the value (importance, worth or usefulness of something) of a currency () determined through fundamental analysis without reference to its market value. Intrinsic value is often referred to as the fundamental value. 
Intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a medium of exchange and a store of value. The intrinsic value of such objects is primarily determined by evaluating them according to, 1) their divisibility; 2) the ease and security with which they are stored, transported, and transferred; 3) their scarcity; and, 4) their difficulty to counterfeit. 
Now tell me, is bitcoin divisible? Fuck yes, it is. It is infinitely divisible… Can you easily and securely store, transport, and transfer bitcoin? Fuck yeah, you can… Is it scarce? Do bears shit in the woods? I recall some shit about only 21 million bitconnneess will ever be minted… Can you easily counterfeit deez cones? No, fuck off, bitcoin is literally impossible to counterfeit.     
Additionally, when objects come to be used as a medium of exchange, their value is mainly determined by their ability to reduce transaction costs. Over time many different modes of exchange (bills, coins, cigarettes, seashells, etc.) have been used to reduce the high transaction costs associated with barter systems and other in-kind transactions. Today, bitcoin is attempting to reduce the high transaction costs associated with our current fiat system. It allows us to send money all over the world for practically nothing.  
Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Unlike other forms of money, it is not backed by a scarce material. Fiat money does not have 'use value' and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. This point was partially explained during the interview
Sooooooo in conclusion, bitcoin has massive amounts of intrinsic value, and you sir, Mr. Kevin O'Leary, can go eat a bag of shit.
