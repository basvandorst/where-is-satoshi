It actually has *nothing* to do with money...

The monetary aspect of Bitcoin really only happens on the edge with the external exchanges.  "Bitcoin" units could represent anything that can be divided into some decimal unit of something...
The term "cryptocurrency" is usually kind of misleading, or even downright incorrect, as the blockchain technology is generally more representative of an immutable, distributed, cryptographically-secure, divisible, store of "value" or some unit(s) of data...
You could even apply the technology to voting systems...

If other markets (like oil) would diversify into Bitcoin, say %10-20, it would probably have a good effect on stabilizing the baseline Bitcoin price, while still attaining a fairly constant (and consistent) growth.  It would certainly help in a sliding (non-bitcoin) market, but it would also probably be a good idea even in a bull market...
The Bitcoin lifeboat is going to be here for a while before everyone's ships' sink...don't get caught with a small dinghy.

A lot of us are in that boat.  I was a click away from 30.00 BTC for maybe...$100? and I didn't do it.  Sure, I was telling everyone else to bet the farm on it, but I ignored my own good advice.
So, I joined a mining pool and mined for a couple of days using a standard run-of-the-mill CPU garnering a meager 0.16 BTC for "free."
Better than nothing, right?

His 37 BTC seems to originate from a block of 100 on 12/06 from this wallet:  
It's a very heavy mover, billions of dollars moved to and from that wallet...
edit:  And it was just juiced from 0.0 with $12 million (in current money.)

1.)  Generate a vanity wallet address starting with **1Boat4BTC** (and don't forget to include a QR code)
2.)  Sail around and advertise yourself on the open sea
3.)  ???
4.)  Profit!

You are **really** missing out on the Martian unicorn ass-snorting stuff, let me tell you...

But will it go farther even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?

What operating system?  (I'll only take 1%...  :)

Bitcoin will eclipse $50K once Venezuela (or Argentina) go tits up.  People will hop onboard like a financial lifeboat.
The block mining reward will halve in a couple years (down to 6 BTC) this will at least double the current value, if not more.  $100K+ would be almost a modest guarantee.

$100K-USD/BTC seems almost like a comically small number...

If I plugged your drive into my Hackintosh right now I could give you your Bitcoins in less than 5 minutes.  :o)
...don't boot the drive, and definitely don't erase/format it, or reinstall/restore anything to it!  You'll want to access the drive externally (or even clone it first, just in case) and then recover...copy...your data.
Chances are your "wallet" data is going to be out of date, so you won't be able to use your bitcoins right away without some effort anyway.  There are some programs that can be used to parse your now "old format" wallet and dump the addresses and requisite private keys that go with them.  You would probably want to do this for cold storage or backup reasons anyway...
You can import (rebuild) a wallet from the private keys, or you can "sweep" the existing address/private keys and balance(s) to a new address.  The latter is usually preferred, and this is basically a single transaction which sends the full balance of unspent outputs for a particular address to another address...

You'll be long dead before the last unit is mined, but the transaction fees are what your great-great-great grandchildren would get...

It's hard to speculate at this point.  My guess is that the technology (and the "original" blockchain for that matter) would have progressed by then anyway, so it probably isn't worth worrying about for at least a few decades.  :)
You have to remember that the bitcoin pool of total "coins" is just going to continually get smaller and smaller every year.  People will be constantly losing them in various ways, so I would never expect more than 40% of them to ever exist...period.
When the reward payout increases, the perceived value ("price") should at least be guaranteed to double, much like a reverse stock split...but without ever increasing any number of "shares" (coins.)  This is going to happen a few more times over the next few decades, so the price of the bitcoin asset is almost guaranteed to exceed six figures...just by supply numbers alone.

Bitcoin will definitely make it to Berskhire Hathaway prices.  That's going to ~~scare~~ *terrify* people.
