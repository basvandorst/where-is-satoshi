Honestly I cant think of the best way to phrase this, but ill try. You dont start a company (bitcoin) and make it nearly impossible to get and have the logic be, that eventually it'll get solved once I get enough money. Why should developers make products if these are some pretty massive issues there has to be some framework that would prevent some of these things from happening which keep people a way. Sorry if that was confusing.

Not wasting money perse?

But it hasn't yet, and I think you are taking the wrong approach. You need to solve volatility before it gets popular, because I believe it cant become popular whilst volatile.

Have good ser, not much is coming of it.

I like how the response of it is unstable, isn't to actually deal with the problem, which there is. But to instead show the volatility over 10 years. Which even then is not much. Sometimes this community makes me sad, we're on the bitcoin subreddit you don't have to push more to us how it is. Instead try to fix the issue of massive volatility.

Or the price had compensated for what they though was going to be the results and they weren't that, let me guess. You have never made no real money on the Stock market, and think because you made some money with Bitcoin you think everything else is obsolete?

I didnt phrase that right, I meant why would anyone put the time into fixing these massive issues. When there could be a whole new currency to eliminate the issues.
