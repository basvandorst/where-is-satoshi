It's debatable whether they have "people's" Bitcoin Gold, or their own Bitcoin Gold.
Either way, they control the private keys to access the corresponding Bitcoin Gold for every Bitcoin stored in Coinbase.

You can definitely set up a Direct Debit. It's down to the company receiving the money to check you are authorized to and often they do a very poor job of it.

That... that's not it works at all. Exchanges don't run on a fractional reserve system: you can't have a bank run. If every single customer of an exchange said "give me all my money" the exchange would not run out of money because they have all the assets they owe people.

Simply using a client that stores the wallet in a different location doesn't really seem like a solution. I think the concern is more that if a vulnerability was ever found in the Bitcoin client it would be much easier to exploit if users are connected to the P2P network.
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:42:03
It's currently pretty difficult, but it's the sort of thing people with some hindsight might use before capital controls are implemented. To be honest, I'm surprised people didn't start trying to transfer their money out weeks before capital controls came into place. If I was Greek I would have moved everything to a foreign bank account and/or Bitcoin weeks ago.

I'm no finance expert, but if I understand correctly (and please correct me if I am wrong) no one loses money when a loan is made: if customer A has $5000 in their account and the bank loans out $1000 to customer B then customer B has $1000 and customer A has $5000 (or the right to access it anyway). That's a total of $6000, even though only $5000 has been put into the system.
Obviously problems start occurring if A wants access to their $5k before B has paid back their $1k.

I'm not sure I really understand. Isn't this basically just redefining 1 Bitcoin as 10 Bitcoins at a tenth of the value (at least that's the only practical way of doing it with the current network structure)? What is the advantage of that over making another unit which is worth 1/100th of the value?

They don't really claim to be anonymous, only pseudonymous, meaning that when you send Bitcoins from one address to another they can be tracked to that new address. They may be harder to track if you convert to a different cryptocurrency and then back because your Bitcoins will probably be added to a massive pot of Bitcoins owned by the exchange and then you would be paid back from that massive pot along with a lot of other people.
If you truly want to hide the origin of coins though there are many easier methods such as mixing services or technologies like CoinJoin.

I think Bitcoin is still obscure enough that it's kind of cute. Perhaps it's fair to say it's more like a gift token to a book shop rather than a PayPal card because it represents more than just financial value, it represents an idea. The Bitcoin kits represents the ideas behind Bitcoin itself much as book shop gift tokens represent a love of reading and belief in the value of reading. Whether it is socially acceptable to offer either of these things to wedding guests is a different matter but I don't think it's hugely tacky.

I just checked it out and unfortunately I can see a number of problems with it. If you have no cell phone coverage then you're pretty screwed.
Also it's completely centralized: if their servers go down, you won't be able to log in to anything at all.
Given all the centralization they have already introduced, why do you even have to scan the on screen image? Surely they could send the request directly to your phone if they will be going through a central server anyway.
I think asymmetric two-factor authentication is the future, but this is one of the poorest implementations I've seen yet.

I suppose that's true in a way, but having your coins stolen/fraudulently stealing them is not really the same as intentionally not having enough assets to pay your debts.
For example, I wouldn't say a bank runs on a fractional reserve system just because there is a chance it could be robbed.

Could you link me to information about such a case? As far as I'm aware, withdrawals have only been halted due to either technical problems or security breaches.
The big ones I remember were MtGox (which we all know is not just because the price dipped, if anything it caused the price to dip) and Bitstamp (they were DDOSed, and had to suspend withdrawals due to a technical problem that caused).

No, I'm fairly sure if that happened, or even if a single shred of cryptographic proof was revealed, almost no one would be questioning Craig's claim.

@_date: 2015-10-18 11:55:49
How do other projects with similar requirements handle this? Tor, for example, requires a lot of nodes run by different organizations to ensure privacy. They seem to have quite a lot of intermediate nodes without an incentive structure.
Admittedly they do struggle to get exit nodes but that's not really a factor in Bitcoin since data never has to leave the network.

I don't believe that was confirmed to be genuine. It wasn't signed, just from an old account he used that many believe could have been compromised. It would still be more proof than the fuck all that Craig has provided though.

I disagree. Good software design has made it so these people are perfectly capable of using a computer without having any idea how it works. Whilst they may be ignorant about that their time is now free to learn about what they are interested in rather than the intricacies of how a browser works.

I see your point, but if I was renting a safety deposit box I would hope the bank had some incentive to keep it safe.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:06:44
Yes, but equally any server-side interaction could do that and would probably be more secure and has the benefit of not requiring any extra client implementation.
As far as I can tell, the 402 code wouldn't really add anything other than potentially more meaningful error messages from HTTP clients that indirectly display the body of the response to the user.
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:22:07
I was struggling to come up with a good definition myself given how much a modern browser does. I mean you've got everything from URL parsing to page rendering to script evaluation all rolled into one huge piece of software. That guys answer is probably the best simple answer anyone would be able to give.
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:44:16
What I mean is it seems difficult to secure your wallet private keys on every computer you browse on.
By server side interaction I mean you can authorize a company to take money from your PayPal / Coinbase / whatever account by directly asking the account provider for the money. For example I try and load a Wall Street Journal article and I have already authorized them to take money from my PayPal account. Wall Street Journal servers then contact PayPal's servers asking them to charge me $0.05. This can in fact already be implemented with no client side handling necessary.
I somewhat disagree with what you are saying about response codes communicating with the browser. Most browsers do very little with response codes (it's sometimes used to determine cacheability but that's about it). If you want to communicate a 404 then really there wouldn't be a major problem for browsers with returning a 200 status and an HTML page indicating the resource was not found. It's mostly automated scripts and non-graphical tools that rely on HTTP status codes to determine the success of a request.

Seems like that could be a bit of a security problem if a website could automatically authorize payments at will and having to keep your Bitcoin private key on every computer you browse on.

For anyone interested in the technical details of the attack, the bookmarklet just loads a script and calls a function in that script.
The script that is loaded includes the current page at the end of the URL. If you load the script on most pages you just get a pretty reasonable looking bit of JavaScript: 
If, however you actually load the script from LocalBitcoins you get this nicely obfuscated pile of crap: 
It has several layers of obfuscation. Even after deobfuscating it the strings are still Base64ed.
The interesting bit is where it generates an API key for itself to access your account and then sends it to 
The whois for the domain claims to be owned by
    Owner Name    : Benjamin Sellers
    Owner Addr    : 17 Hanover square
    Owner Addr    : London
    Owner Addr    : London

I'm not even sure that would help much. The bookmarklet could just as easily throw up a dialog pretending that LocalBitcoins is prompting for your password for some other reason.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:36:05
Yeah, this seems very deceptively described.


But then the post doesn't describe that attack. It describes someone with physical access to your powered on, unlocked computer being able to get your seed, in which case they could just install malware to steal the passwords to your keys even if they were encrypted.

What do people think of the Trezor? It seems like an awesome idea. I am constantly paranoid that a virus will steal all my coins. Is there a solution similar to the Trezor available at the moment (rather than a pre-order)?
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:37:32
Exactly, plus by selling mining contracts they insulate themselves against changes in mining difficulty and Bitcoin's value. Its the exact same reasons people sell hardware miners rather than just using them themselves.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:53:18
If they're willing to run arbitrary JavaScript on a website that holds their Bitcoins I would think their suspicion isn't going to be raised much by a password prompt, especially if it just said something like "You've been logged out due to inactivity, please login again."
@_date: 2013-09-07 20:15:08
That is a good point. It would make a lot of sense if it was stored there so it is encrypted with the phone's passcode.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:52:50
The entire method by which it works is that you have to run some random JavaScript on LocalBitcoins. It's not XSRF, it's XSS initiated by the user. There's not really any way of preventing this other than not being an idiot and running random JavaScript snippets on websites you are logged in to.
@_date: 2013-08-11 19:40:35

@_date: 2013-12-22 18:00:01
Because you can't make a decision that affects who has a certain number of Bitcoins without forking the blockchain. If the foundation says that there should not be an award any more for mining a block and your foundation says there should still be one because otherwise not enough people will keep mining (just an example) then by definition you have to fork the blockchain because otherwise how do you change whether or not people are getting coins for mining new blocks?
