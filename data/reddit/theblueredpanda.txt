So, if I have it right . . . You're in favour of increased regulation?

Thanks for your input Bruce. I just watched the first half of the video - it's fantastic to have such a credible opinion on board. I agree with your sentiments regarding the evolution of transactions to preclude 'trusted' 3rd parties - for me, that's one of the greatest if not *the* greatest advantage of using crytocurrencies.
Also, I completely agree with the idea that while Bitcoin's longevity may be suspect, it is the idea of using decentralised, cryptographic currency that is here to stay. I like the analogy of 'the canary in the coalmine' - Bitcoin may falter and eventually die, but others will learn from its mistakes. As widespread usage of cryptocurrencies increases and the obvious drawbacks of using centralised fiat are becoming more apparent, I believe that this technology is the way forward. Given time, others will hopefully see it this way too.

That was basically my original title - "Bitcoin: How Statist Asshats Will Try to Exert Dominion over the Masses"
Alternative was - "I Don't Give a Fuck about your Law Noise: The Bitcoin Story"

This is a great resource, cheers.

Awesome, i hadn't even considered licenses and trading. Trading in securities and other such financial instruments is so heavily regulated that it would make sense that, given time, authorities will seek to do the same with Bitcoin. *sigh* Now, if only they could realise that increased regulation of allegedly over-complicated financial instrument trading has little to do with systemic risk in the markets, that would be another thing entirely.

This will probably get lost, but . .
Tell your son to keep the faith.
I just finished a masters in financial law in a fairly good university (top 15 world), and my thesis paper was a very liberal argument on how regulators/policy-makers have a responsibility not to stifle the early innovation of Bitcoin/blockchain technology and indeed  need to embrace it and kindle the flame for future generations. I got a distinction on the paper, so evidently my teacher was a bit more open minded than your son's! So I would just say to him to keep his chin up and don't let one close-minded individual tarnish his (super-progressive and very advanced) view on a technology that has the possibility to define how his generation interacts with money, banks and all aspects of interpersonal transactions.

Basically in some jurisdictions Bitcoin has been classed as a taxable asset instead of a currency - it basically means that there are different laws in place when it comes to its usage but can also means less protections etc and a different sort of taxation system. It equates Bitcoin to a good or service used in payment, rather than currency which has its own legal definition.

Thanks. Tell me about it. What little research I managed to do at the beginning of the academic year in September / October is now utterly irrelevant and completely out of date... Dissertations on income tax laws from the 1970s, while boring as fuck, tend not to have the same level of information turnover.

This is very much in thinking with my tutor, who is an ex-CFO at a large London investment bank. He's convinced the whole thing is a Ponzi scheme / Dutch tulip / you name it.
With regards to your 1st point, doesn't the whole idea of cryptocurrencies with hard-coded internal rules kind of stand in defiance of this? As in, the protection is built-in so as not to require any external applications of law or regulation?
And your last point - haven't some jurisdictions already classified it as currency though? Do you think it will affect cross-border transactions in practice if some jurisdictions define it as a commodity and others a currency? Or would governments / central authorities even get a look in? I suppose that enters the realm of taxation, which I will probably be examining to an extent as well.
Great input, thanks for taking the time and I look forward to anything else you could provide next week!

Essentially, you've pretty much epitomised the standpoints I'm taking on each topic. With regards to 2, it's just a phrase I keep coming across. It's to do with the legal liability for the use and misuse of Bitcoin, but it's actually a far more complex idea than simply that, and depends a lot on whether Bitcoin is classed as a currency or a commodity by the relevant jurisidiction.
Cheers for the input and the well wishes!

Anyway, other than that great points, and by and large I agree with you.
1. I suppose I meant external, state-enforced laws as opposed to internal, hard-coded rules.
2. . . . Yeeeessss?
3. Yup.
4. Well, essentially yes. The inflation fiasco in the US fed is fucking ridiculous, the fed is ruining the US economy from the inside and has been for a number of years. And yes I agree, lending of last resort serves no other purpose other than creating a moral hazard wherein private investment banks always know that they have public money and bailouts waiting for them if they take silly risks.

What about altruism and helping your fellow man? Financial law isn't *all* about the money, dude.

@_date: 2014-05-06 01:17:13
1. Yes.
2. Yes, but I was more talking about the wider implications of Bitcoin misuse - a legal framework must be in place before there can be any liability in the first instance.
3. Completely.
4. Lordy Lord I do believe. Can't wait to tell my grandkids that I was there, fighting at the forefront of the war against the centralised fiat empire just before it came crashing down in a glorious libertarian victory. Or, at the least, that I was browsing various relevant subreddits for a few hours each day in my underwear.

You know what, Troll31? I think you're right. Those Bitcoiners - always trying to steer me astray.

Maybe not so much in the EU? I have a job secured for when I leave with a large commercial law firm. None of my (graduated) friends have had much trouble finding law jobs either :|

Why do you so ardently claim that a government / central authority cannot force taxation on private citizens? Sure, if there were taxes put in place there would be ways to circumvent them, but doing so would be no different to breaking existing tax laws. Again - much of it comes down to whether a jurisdictions classifies Bitcoin as a currency or a commodity, but I know that some have already declared it to be a taxable asset.
