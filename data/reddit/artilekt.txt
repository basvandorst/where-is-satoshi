Question: Since the passphrase is just the "25th word" of the seed conceptually, is any word sufficiently secure? Or does it need to be a complex passphrase, something like would be used with a BIP38 paper wallet?

Well by "long term success" I'd imagine it's whether or not it's still existing in 20 or 50 years or something.
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:09:06
Is this because they are bitcoin supporters trying to get behind the cause or because it makes good business sense? $20 off $100 seems like way more than they are saving by using BTC over credit cards.

It's cool to see a price spike on the news but I think we still have the medium term price problem of none of these outlets holding btc which will continue to put downward pressure on the price.

@_date: 2014-11-23 18:41:24
I agree that micro-transactions are a key feature of bitcoin, but at least on reddit I think there should be some reddiquette tipping minimum.
It'd be different if there was just a tip button and you could see the total tips a post has received or a reply has received in the same way you can see the upvotes/downvotes. But even using "private" with changetip generates a comment and it really does get annoying, and I'm sure I'm not alone, to see a thread populated with these extremely small tip comments.
@_date: 2014-10-07 07:09:58
Even then it's not dead. I bought some BTC at $5 and it wasn't dead then so why would it be dead at $50? The thing is BTC is not a company or stock so it can't really go "bankrupt" unless it actually goes to 0.
@_date: 2014-01-12 07:39:59
I think this is why the U.S. founders wrote so critically about democracy.

@_date: 2014-10-07 07:12:44
I have read this article but I guess I'm still confused as to why it has to follow the boom/bust pattern instead of a more consistent rise as bitcoin is adopted as medium of exchange by incrementally more parts of the economy.
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:17:12
Yeah I get that but it is still new supply that is sopping up demand. I think this might change after the next halving.
There are also miners and companies that "accept" bitcoin  adding to the downside pressure.
@_date: 2015-05-20 07:10:21
Everything looks very promising but there is still a lack of real demand for coins outside of speculation (for now) and a continuous onslaught of supply.
I think uncertainty about the resolution of the block size debate is also an issue affecting price as well.

Yeah for sure..the cool thing about bitcoin though is that it can be spent at places all over the Internet so is generally more useful than reddit gold, at least if you're getting more than 10 bits or whatever other ridiculously small amounts people are throwing around here.

It's been weird experiencing this change in perspective firsthand. I first got into Bitcoin during the 2011 crash from $30 to $2. That $30 level looked like a huge mountain on the chart that seemed nearly impossible to surpass. I thought it could be many years before it reached that level again. Not too long after that it was smaller than a molehill on the chart.
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:36:20

I've been here since '11 and I know what you mean. Still it makes me nervous when those stories come up. I think it's healthier for Bitcoin if his identity is never revealed and the price seems to reflect this when new "Satoshi found!" stories hit the headlines. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:02:22
I don't think it's irrelevant since the knowledge of satoshi's real identity could have some bearing on the likelihood of the movement of the million coins estimated to be under his control.

@_date: 2019-10-21 16:53:46
I understand this perspective but I think there's still a lot of ignorance of how bitcoin actually works in people who are involved in the market. There are probably many people who have been bought btc who don't even know this is going to happen. So I'm not sure it's totally priced in at this point.
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:08:33
It was a surprise rollout that benefited insiders.

Thanks! So would it be best to pick one and stick with it instead of using both to prevent confusion?
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:56:31
The demand doesn't really have to increase that's the thing. If we assume that miners are dumping their block reward coins, or most of them to pay the bills, the amount they can dump in a day is cut it half. This cuts that daily sell pressure in half. So demand would really only need to stay the same to see a big price increase.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:37:52
I get what you're saying but Bitcoin is like cash or gold so I think the risk is higher. It'd be like if people figured your friend had 10-15 million in cash in his house. People might be more inclined to make an attempt.

Ahhh ok I think from reading these answers it's starting to come together for me. Ok so when you say "there will be one where the last 3 digits are 0", that doesn't mean there is ONLY one correct? Just that's it's hard to find "right" answers? Is this where difficulty comes in? So as the network becomes stronger, you have to make it more difficult to find the correct answers. Is this done by doing something with the nonces or by putting stricter requirements on the hash results? I think it is the latter. Am I on the right track here? Thanks

Ahh ok I think this is probably it.
This didn't happen on my first few tests though I was getting the same results with Electrum and Wasabi. I chose native segwit addresses for both skeleton wallets. Was there something I accidently did somewhere in the process that would have caused these different derivation paths? Would I have to start over with a new seed to fix this?
Is there a way to use the coldcard with wasabi and electrum both or is it best to stick to one or the other to prevent this kind of confusion?
Thank you!

I think what he means is price and the expectation of future price. Increasing hash rate doesn't *cause* price increases since all pricing is subjective. Miners are expecting btc price to go up that's why they're making investments in mining machines. If they expected to lose money over the long term they wouldn't make the investment and hash rate wouldn't rise.
@_date: 2011-06-30 21:39:04
Exactly. I bought when bitcoins were higher than this and I have lost money, but that's ok. I'd rather see BTC stay stable like this for MONTHS. This would really do a lot to draw additional real commerce into BTC.
@_date: 2011-09-13 18:33:08
I agree. I mean it would suck if you had put a bunch of $ into namecoins in that particular chain range that's true. But if this attack can be done, and be done successfully, it's only a matter of time until a "bad guy" does it and they won't be so kind as to warn anyone ahead of time.

This is why I've always thought that it's important for there to be a healthy network of cash-to-bitcoins (and vice versa) exchangers out on the ground. I think the easy way for someone to clamp down on bitcoin would be to attack the money flow between dollars, or whatever, and bitcoins. 
@_date: 2011-10-20 16:15:31
Great post! I've often thought that once the implications of international money transfer really sink in with people, that alone will make bitcoin grow significantly.
@_date: 2011-10-12 07:21:08
Excuse me if I'm wrong but it kind of depends on what you mean by deflationary doesn't it? In the sense of an actual reduction in money supply, you're right it will be when actual coins are lost. But once all the bitcoins are mined, it will basically be a deflationary environment as the price of goods and services goes down in bitcoin. Once the supply of bitcoins is (mostly) static, as more goods and services are created their price will go down in bitcoins. Right?

I wonder who owns all that "Unknown" though. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 04:20:58
After all this,what's your opinion at this point?
@_date: 2016-05-06 04:19:39
Just for clarity's sake I believe Gavin claims that it was blocks 1 and 9. Not the genesis block.

I think he's saying that it's not just that you're looking at the 1W but that you could change the parameters of the MACD itself and get entirely different results. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:21:21
What's your blog?
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:36:49
You think so? I'm a Core guy but haven't noticed any particular bias. They actually have seemed pretty neutral to me - just giving a platform to different voices in the space, even if I disagree with them. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:51:30
Couldn't you have accomplished the same thing by unfollowing him?
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:20:24
Damn that is downright beautiful. My feelings exactly.

Is it blowing anyone else's mind that Chris Tarbell is showing the world how to use the dark web?
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:14:51
That was brilliant. Yours and OPs were the best explainers I've seen so far. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:31:45
They're the George Noory of crypto. They'll agree with anyone. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:46:48
I actually think this is the most informative and funny video. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:12:24
Are you always this annoying?
@_date: 2013-01-31 09:08:47
Just curious, how do you know it was a single purchase? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:51:00
What resource would you recommend? 
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:29:54
I was under the impression a VPN didn't encrypt your connection but routed you through other ip's. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 07:21:56
Your day will come again, friend. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 17:19:47
Only the Silent Mail part of Silent Circle has been shut down. Encrypted text and voice is still operational. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:19:49
When I disputed the cancellation they did NOT honor my purchase. That's why I stopped doing business with them.
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:51:59
Perfect use case right here!
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:30:38
You took a picture of him? 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:17:28
come again??
@_date: 2013-01-31 21:49:04
I think you are exactly right.
If they can't fulfill these transactions then they shouldn't be offering them in the first place. I placed a 10btc buy order with them right before the $20 wall came down. Hopefully they don't pull this bs with me!
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:04:56
Thanks but this isn't a bitcoin deposit. I just deposited cash and it should have shown up in my account hours ago, confirmations would be necessary only for a bitcoin deposit.
@_date: 2013-09-29 08:15:59
"Fool me once shame on... Shame on you? Ya fool me can't get fooled again." 
@_date: 2013-07-03 09:19:11
Exactly, I believe this is Peter's point.
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:40:16
Very cool. 
Two recommendations: 
1. Have the sounds correlated with the size of the transactions. 
2. Don't know if you can even do this but it'd be cool if once a block is found, the block and the transactions in front of it slowly sink away relative to the newer transactions. This would be a cool way I think to visualize those transactions sinking one confirmation deeper into the blockchain.
Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:57:37
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:16:49
Or use a VPN? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:29:56
Yeah I guess that's my only option at this point. Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-09-02 04:40:43
Yes. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 05:24:23
I agree. Even Jim Rickards, a guy I respect a lot, seemed stuck on this in his bitcoin debate. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:37:04
Guess Coinbase is out of the question then! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:11:40
That was an amazingly clear explanation! Once I get an account with the tipbot you will be getting a tip from me.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:19:39
Brilliant! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:53:22
Wouldn't you rather use a decentralized currency vs. a centralized one? Isn't that one of the big ideas here? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:47:37
Just replying to say that Coinbase never honored my original price, after multiple emails. This was awhile ago, but it still felt pretty shitty. And of course it was after a large run-up in price. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:17:09
This is exactly what happens. 
@_date: 2013-02-28 07:29:37
Best to take computer offline and then generate your addresses.
@_date: 2013-09-20 06:58:20
I have used bitsumo and everything went smoothly. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 01:17:10
This, along with some of the other methods I've seen in this thread, seems like a cool way of generating a secure passphrase but I'm not sure why people don't just use the much simpler Diceware method which is just as secure as far as I'm aware. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:28:49
Couldn't you have sent that as a private message instead of alerting anyone who read this thread that they could steal from me?
@_date: 2013-01-26 04:01:22
I'm 32 what generation am I? Y?

Bull markets climb a wall of worry as they say.. 
@_date: 2013-01-21 07:48:50
I wish there were some shorting period.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:03:39
I hope you are joking. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:23:49
Exactly. All it takes is one new large buyer or seller to enter the market to really gum up the works.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:01:22
Exactly! It is starting to drive me crazy how many people will pass up an easy and secure method of doing this and instead try to be super clever. Just do Diceware and be done with it. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:10:58
Me too me too!! 
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:09:13
They refused to make good on my cancelled order after significant btc appreciation. I had a fully verified account with multiple previous orders. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:59:29
Keep asking him I'm sure he'll reveal all the secrets to you. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:05:37
Isn't this true with anything? Including gold? And isn't he basically saying free market pricing doesn't work? 
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:25:39
I don't think it will take quite that long to become more stable. As the market grows it will take more and more amounts of money to cause big fluctuations. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 17:20:45
Only the Silent Mail part of Silent Circle has gone dark. Encrypt text and voice is still operational. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:47:27
A few months ago when btc was like 13 or 16. I bought twelve and in the next week btc appreciated considerably. They cancelled my order on the day they were supposed to deliver the coins. I had a fully verified account with a number of prior transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:15:32
I love how he acts like being exposed to currency risk is one of the main reasons it will never work.
Doesn't he realize that companies like Bitpay already exist to eliminate this risk for merchants? Does he have any idea what he's talking about?
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:35:50
Thanks for the reply!
I was under the impression however, and it says this at the end of the stack exchange section, that as of recent Bitcoin versions the rescan should be done automatically when loading backups?
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:29:05
Ok I see. Thanks for the help! I guess I will start saving the backup every 50 or 60 transactions just to be safe.
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:22:33
I was aware to back it up every 100 transactions. I guess that's why I'm confused, because the wallet only has 83 transactions in it. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:08:37
I don't recall generating more addresses but I guess I could have and I'm just not remembering. Is this something that can be "fixed" with the back up wallet? Or should I just trash it and create a new backup?
Also, if generating more addresses voids the backup, I guess it would be good policy to create a new backup wallet every time you generate more addresses?
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:18:10
I admire Roger but sometimes think he's from Skynet.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:22:41
If you click on the "Paper Wallet" tab then you will see a box to check for bip38 encryption and a place to enter the passphrase.
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:15:24
Ixquick became startpage I believe. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:36:49
I think invictus's Keyhotee is trying to solve this identity issue. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:34:38
I thought the same thing! Even with my much smaller amounts of btc I like to break bigger transactions into smaller amounts just in case I make a mistake. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:11:50
Cool thanks! Am trying this..first thing I notice is that when I go to the properties of the desktop shortcut, in the target field mine says "....\ArmoryQT.exe.log" NOT just "...\ArmoryQT.exe". Think that is a significant difference?
Also, just to be clear, I'm assuming here that I would replace "c:\armory" with whatever my target directory is going to be right?
I'm going to be moving the entire database folder so I should use --datadir then right?
@_date: 2013-04-01 07:28:49
Was looking for a relationship too and assumed there would be one. Pretty cool idea but sound definitely needs to be correlated to transaction size. 
@_date: 2013-08-06 05:26:52
I believe that is a couple, friend. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:27:04
So...how much ya got?
@_date: 2013-02-28 05:47:58
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:21:57
Whatever happened to Bruce anyway? 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:09:23
Coinbase refused to honor my original transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:12:27
I gave my dad a 2011 casascius coin on Xmas of 2011 and he thinks he either lost it or gave it away thinking it was a quarter. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:02:24
That's great that they honored your order! They never honored mine. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 02:37:00
No offense but if it's so easy why isn't this happening all the time? 
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:49:20
That's cool they did that for you.
I didn't have such luck on the other hand. I had a 12.31BTC order snatched away from me at the last minute and despite my communications with Coinbase about the issue, they have so far refused to honor my original order. I have a fully verified account with prior successful transactions.
I wonder how they're picking who to help out?
@_date: 2013-04-24 07:08:05
I absolutely think this is true. Seems by far the safest way to store a person's main hoard of BTC for now.
@_date: 2013-08-31 18:53:35
I definitely second this. I bet a lot of people would appreciate the heads up.
@_date: 2013-01-22 00:41:15
Yeah I was aware that there are a couple places to short but none of them seem to have attracted the influence or volume that Bitcoinica had. Thanks for the link. 
@_date: 2013-01-12 19:18:00
I completely agree. This is one of the main things keeping me from being very confident in the ultimate success of Bitcoin. The problem of how the network will stay secure as mining rewards drop toward zero is a big one. I also am not satisfied with answers like "it will work itself out." I would like to see this figured out sooner rather than later. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:01:00
Thanks for the heads up about this company! Their products look awesome. Looks like I'll be sending some btc their way soon.. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 07:04:39
Does Coinbase still cancel orders at the last minute when price goes up?
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:30:11
But that's the feedback loop I've always seen existing in Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin has *any* value, it provides lots of benefits to the people who use it. This attracts users, which increases demand for bitcoins, which increases its value. Bitcoins are like tickets into the system. I dunno that's just how I've always looked at it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:54:51
Definitely. Reputation and trust is crucial here.
@_date: 2013-09-19 14:38:51
Yeah if we get rid of advertising, people wouldn't become aware of products or services they might want or need! Awesome! 
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:09:08
I deleted my account too. 1% markup to buy was enticing but it's not enticing when you find out your order was cancelled a week later.
@_date: 2013-07-01 17:23:39
Yeah how's that for confidence? Haha
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:41:39
Cool thanks! I will give that a try tonight. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 05:21:05
I concur. It would be cool if there was something special for really large transactions. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 07:00:59
Some are willing to pay a premium for anonymity I suppose?
