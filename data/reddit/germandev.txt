What does the one (nullc knowing the outcome of the meeting beforehand) have to do with the other (people remembering the outcome)? Maybe you misunderstood the sentence you quoted?

I really can't tell if OP is joking or not. With BU having &gt;40% hash rate, this twitter post does not make any sense to me...
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:10:23
The [thread form one year ago](is also very interesting to read.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:20:41
But SW+bigger blocks would be fine, right? I don't think most big blockers are against SW. I think most "big block proponents" are just against SW without a long term on-chain scaling solution in sight.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:10:43
Thank you for the information. If I understood the document right, you basically explained your long term vision for bitcoin based on SW.


But the consensus was a SW+HF solution, right? Why do you not agree with the proposed solution then?
Why can you not get an agreement (with the BU/bug blocker camp) for SW now and a HF increase in a few month to please them?

Thanks again. And again I think this is a really strange response from him. From my point of view, he seems to be confusing "Bitcoin Core" (open source project) with his company Blockstream. I think the responses to his answer show a similar confusion...
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:08:43
Sorry, when I typed my message I did not see your message (as they were just 3 mins apart). I now answered directly to that. Maybe I misinterpreted your statement. As you are the CTO of Blockstream and you were speaking of developers "personally working" (I read that as: opposed to working for the company). Maybe I put too much weight into it..

Thank you, didn't expect you to be that open for discussion. Really glad about it.
My understanding is that first, segwit would've been released as a softfork in 2016 (including the malleability fix) and in 2017 a hard fork would've been made to scale. As most (maybe &gt;90%?) miners would've been on board with the HF, it seems to me like a safe way to scale.
Btw: I'm sorry for my slow replies. I'm mostly a lurker and kind of new to reddit, therefore reddit is only allowing me a reply in like every 10mins or so.

I hope so, but it may be quite complicated to get the needed hash rate for segwit. I hope the community can find a compromise on SW+HF, maybe even SW+BU.


I agree with you that bitcoin (the protocol) is not broken, but the current fees and the declining market share of bitcoin (compared to other cryptocurrencies) seems alarming to me.
Thank you for the open discussion, sorry for misinterpreting your statement earlier.

That is called variance. Next week it might be 45/30 again..
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:33:39
Thanks for pointing that out. However, in reality SW will only help to put about 60-100% more transactions into a block (according to  ). So this "block increase" will barely satisfy the 2MB hardfork folks and certainly not the people who want 4MB or 8MB blocks.

Thank you for answering. Most of my questions are answered, but I'm still a bit confused about these two parts:


That's easy to say retroactively. But why did you not even give it a chance? Maybe the outcome would've been better if more core developers (and not just a few) would have attended?


And who would be allowed to make a statement that "core agreed"? I always thought that bitcoin core was open source, contributed to by many individuals. I thought the statement "multiple contributors agreed" would be as good as it can be. You make it sound to me, like there is central authority.
Thanks again, would be happy if you could answer the two questions of me.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:14:10
Thank you for the link. I think the response from is kind of strange. He seems to ignore that multiple core developers agreed to the consensus (even Furthermore, he does not explain why he wanted the developers to stay away from the meeting.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:23:19
Thank you for answering.


Why? If all developers would've agreed and the miners wanted bigger, who else is there to oppose?
And one last question: Why are you yourself so opposed to the roundtable consensus? Is it something technical or political that you think is wrong with it? To me it reads like a good compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:46:15


That does not sound plausible to me. Let's assume BIP148 does fail (by not getting "economic majority"). Then the BIP148 nodes will follow a minority chain that will die off in the long term. The legacy nodes will still follow the longer chain.
Can you explain that to me? how is that not a risk for BIP148 nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:15:08
I think, you misunderstood my question. I'm asking why they would ever support ONLY the BIP148 chain (instead of supporting the main chain and the BIP148 chain).
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:42:26
Yeah. But that is my question. If they provide both options, then BIP148 does not work. So why should they ever *only* support the BIP148 chain?
