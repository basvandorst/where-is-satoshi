Needs to be a running shirt - quite hot here. Not one of those heavy cotton ones - know of any?

No plans to be in Amsterdam in November so far, but you never know :D ... Amsterdam is pretty cool - lived not so far away from there for 4 years.. As I said, I will pay all shipping charges :D .. No prob at all. Maybe PM me with the details :)

Domain name no problem - do it. I will make sure to be in line for some of those MarathonFoto guys and my girlfriend will make some photos also. Will ship it to Denmark unfortunately - not US - and I will pick it up during Christmas. Shipping is on me :) - no worries..

Thanks :) .. Will do.. Just checked my registration info, but no start number yet. I will make another post, when I know.

Whoa... Thank you very much! Now I feel obliged to lose my small beer belly by then and get below 4 hours. I will post my start number here once I know it, so everybody can follow my progress on that day.

I am working on my beer belly.. Running a Marathon unfortunately in February, so I am afraid all my hard work these past two years will be lost up until then.

So guys ... How about all of us meet up in Monaco in a couple of years time and have a "who has the biggest yacht" contest?

Cool! .. :)

That would be great! No sleeveless :) - I'd prefer short sleeves.
If you have a home page, then I would make an order ASAP, ship it to my parents in Denmark and then pick it up during Christmas.

If you cannot do dryfit, then it is okay - I will wear my skins shirt underneath. Should be fine..  Let me know.. :)
