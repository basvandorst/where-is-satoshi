That was my point. And yet they dump on segwit and refer to Bitcoin as segwit coin.

Average price of a pizza is $10 (conservative?). Times by 10,000. BTC $ = $100K / 2 = $50K per BTC = well within 2018 according to some analysts.

What confidence does everyone have that Bcash will not incorporate LN? Highly unlikely given it wasn’t part of “Satoshi’s vision in the whitepaper”?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:07:24
Never publicly disclose. Unfortunately your key is only as private as your kneecaps’ pain tolerance. I believe there is an XKCD on this. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:33:35
And they’ll still be empty. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:11:30
I agree. However Bcash’s whole mantra as the “true bitcoin” is the SW, LN and any other changes apart from 1TB sized blocks should not be entertained. Be interesting to see how much integrity they have.

Just checked to make sure I’m not making things up. My BPAY limit is 8K and 2K for POLi. My account says “verified”. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:59:14
I second this. Can’t you BPAY more than 2K? Or is this dependent on verification? Whatever you do, avoid the thieves at CoinJar.

You ignored the first lesson - do your own research. The fact you listen to other people to make personal financial decisions is worrisome. I guess if you can’t be a good example, be a terrible warning.

Are you conveniently forgetting BTC is c. 10K? Most people I know dropped BCH soon after it airdropped. Pumps aside, it tends to avg. .16 BTC.

I spend appx $5K per month on my credit card. It is linked to an airline rewards programme. I receive an incredible amount of rewards for doing nothing different with my spending habits. It also exposes me to some great retail offers periodically in addition to being able to leave funds in my savings account for (on average) 6 weeks longer (all the while earning interest). 
The notion of using BTC for retail transactions is a little strange to me. I am pro SW, LN and so forth, but I don't understand why people would give up all of the above benefits and furthermore, remove themselves from a highly proven fraud protection net and still have to bear the cost of the transaction. Delinking from central banking is a huge boon in the long run, but what is the incentive for the customer? 
I predominantly value BTC as a store of wealth, but any exposure is great and I'm certainly interested to see what develops over the coming months with regard to payments.

On a serious note, I doubt it’s a trickle; more a systemic torrent.

The OP is so far off the mark it's not even funny. Credit cards serve a very solid purpose and provide significant consumer protection. Ultimately this is hidden in the fee levied onto merchants. However, I do not imagine crypto replacing it in any short period and truth be told, I don't think I'd want them to. I hope they will both exist and serve slightly different areas. 
I've had fraudulent activity before and have always been covered. I've also had travel insurance claims and extended warranty coverage. All very solid benefits. If someone gets your key, it is game over. Zero protection.

Ah OK thanks for the responses. Makes sense. Either way, imdoingmypart.jpg.

Sorry to report my Mac Mini client has taken over 8 days and is still only at 75%. Something seriously bizarre going on. 7 Mb ADSL2+ connection. Have ordered a wifi router so I can set up proper port forwarding. ISP issued one is useless. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:01:36
Thankyou.

They have a very clear and simple step by step on the main bitcoin website, along with the respective clients.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:41:00
I downloaded the latest client (Mac Mini) on Sunday. I am halfway through downloading the blockchain. Is it common to take a week to complete? I have a c. 7 Mb connection.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:05:14
Ironic.

This attitude is poison. We want the right solution, not a compromise. If Bitcoin can't find a way to enact a solution outside of compromise with a toxic sect of miners, it has failed.

Couldn't agree more. Anyone who considers this software is either malicious or retarded.

Except the blocks will veer towards 8mb.
