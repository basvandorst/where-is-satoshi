You make very good points. For me realistic is anything near the market value. My issue is that it would be too many eggs in one basket even for a very short period of time.
Institutional purchasers will not be making bids for the tame reason... You can't hedge against the risk.

$700 seems pricey. I will start a meet up.com group and get people together at a local cafe instead.

5% but its quite a lot as my net worth is over 7 figures already when I used some play money in 2011 to buy a few bitcoins.

I have enough cash to register for this auction and make a realistic bid, but after discussing this with my wife this morning our decision is not to get involved. 3000 bitcoins is a very large amount of risk to hold at the moment. Too much for us anyway. With that many, we wouldn't find the current market volatility tolerable as investors.

This is awesome! (Buy Chai and a Chaco and play some MTG then buy bitcoins all in one loc!)

Short answer: yes. Longer answer: looks like you have support, so get a promo and a plan together and fund it on bitcoinstarter or whatever its called.

Err.. Coinfire has your real name and the companies you are involved with and your bid price. Your anonymity is history.

Dammit I wanted to be first! But gg, we should have a FC Bitcoin meet up.
