Once its gets to the point where they're dicking you around file a CFPB complaint.

Have everything printed and got all the hardware. Using Pi Zero W as the controller. If someone can help with the code I might be able to send you one of the finished product. :)

Are you willing to post the code you used to control it via the Raspberry Pi? I am trying to make my own version of this but am having issues with the code.

Hey, Im working on a version of this project and posted my base. I'm stuck on the code part. As a ME it's definitely not my strong suit. Will this code work on the Raspberry Pi Zero to control or would I need the mkr1000?

I have posted a modified version of a base that is compatible with Bitcoin Roller Coaster Guy. It uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W as the controller and a single servo motor. The servo can be found on amazon.
Link here: 
I am currently trying to work on the code to control the coaster based on % Gain. If anyone has some experience with this and would like to help please PM me! As a mechanical engineer my weakness was always the code.

Ahh my eyes

Were you the one who was working on the code part? Would you perhaps be willing to share the code with those of us who are trying to put one together for personal use?

Great! I greatly appreciate your help!
I am actually working on a base that would be compatible with your guy's Raspberry Pi. I'm not sure if you guys have plans for a base or what but you're more than welcome to use the one I put up.
