Still possible, headers (including subjects) are unencrypted.


Still possible, if the login process includes "enter your PGP private key and password" (only kept client-side, of course). You could even store the encrypted form of your private key on Google's servers and still keep end-to-end crypto: without your password, it's useless. This preserves the possibility of logging on from someone else's computer (but then you have to worry about *them* having keylogger/malware installed).
Most of your other points are valid: these things would be difficult to impossible to do without massive amounts of data and/or algorithms being downloaded to your client, or waiting for your client to decrypt it and submit the plaintext for analysis (which eliminates many of the benefits of using crypto in the first place).

First, read  for an easy intro to why your password may not be as strong as you think.
Next, here are some sites that let you type in your password to see how strong they think it is:  and  (they look legit enough, but I can't really vouch for the fact that they're *not* stealing your password)
If you chose your password like most people do, your password is probably not as secure as you think it is, and it's not really possible to know just how secure it is against any given attacker. If you use a randomly-generated password, then you can know exactly how strong it is, and it *really* is that strong: even if you told your attacker exactly how you generated the password, you and he can both know it's completely implausible for him to crack it. I recommend using a good password manager like KeePass, and using a *generated* passphrase with ~128 bits entropy (i.e. unbreakable) as your master password (you can use [Electrum]( as your generator, it has a list of easy-to-remember words).
And yes, the "should take" vs reality can vary wildly, but when the "should take" is on the order of "forever", even the 0.00001% probability is on the order of "longer than a lifetime".

**No, it's not totally safe.** Incompetence or malice on their part, or an order by a government over them, can cause you to lose any bitcoins you have stored there.
**But it is easy.** And it appears to not have any rampant incompetency or malice. And if you're only doing legal things with it, you're probably not going to draw any govt attention/orders to your account. You might consider it safe enough (especially if you only store a small amount of money there).
If you want a more secure option and are willing to take ownership and secure the keys yourself, use something where you control the private keys. In roughly increasing security/privacy and decreasing ease of use, here are some good alternatives where you alone control your private keys:
* Blockchain.info's web wallet
* Electrum
* Armory

It's simple!  
Think of the bills and coins as transaction outputs, and you're the machine that has to add them up to be equal or greater than the output you need. Just take a $20 bill, a $5 bill, and a $1 bill (remember the sales tax! merchants typically do not include this in the advertised price), hand it to the cashier, and they'll hand you back 3 pennies (worth 3 centidollars, cents for short). Or if you don't have a $20, $5, and $1, maybe you have a $20 and a $10, and they'll give you back 4 $1s and 3 pennies (we should really come up with one easy denomination for these, maybe just call it "dols", make it worth 1 penny, and use that, e.g. this costs 2399 dols). This is called "change". It's much more inconvenient than the change you're used to with Bitcoin since you have to add it up using little units instead of just creating an output/bill for yourself in the right amount, but it works. If you collect enough of this "change", you can trade it in to a cashier for a more compact (i.e. higher value) bill.  
Wasn't that easy!
There's always the chance that the cashier will give you too much or too little change, so make sure you don't get in trouble for keeping too much by accident.

(no-nonsense answer for 91914 and anyone else actually asking the question) No, "anything lower than the highest price ever" is not automatically considered "cheap" in the English language. Usually, "cheap" in a context like this means "less than regular price".
The reason people keep describing them as "cheap" is that they think it will be more expensive in the future (in economic markets, especially stock markets and also Bitcoin, this is called "bullish", contrasted with the opposite "bearish"). Part of the grounds for this belief (whether a valid reason or not) is that the price was higher in the past.
I agree with you that buyer's remorse is probably some of this. When they bought it, they thought the price would go up. Since it has not (yet), they choose to believe that it's a temporary lull and will still go above their purchase price, thus making them currently "cheap".

My first Circle experience: I received a mail-in rebate from Corsair today in the form of a prepaid Visa card. Instead of the hassle of carrying an extra card, having to carefully track the balance, find places I could easily use it instead of my normal credit cards, split a bill to finish it off or leave it with a buck or two, etc. I just added it to Circle, received $19.44 in BTC (2.9% fee), and transferred it to my Armory wallet.
I'm now 51.6 mBTC richer!
And then I removed the card from my Circle account, since it's useless now.
Overall, very fast and painless compared to Coinbase, or other methods of purchasing bitcoins.

I say **nay to "bit-dollars"**. Besides the unnecessary association with dollars, it's a non-SI size, which is confusing. Much as I dislike "bits", it has a redeeming quality: its size is based on an SI-like power of 10, the same as a microBTC, 10^-6 BTC.

I disagree: I think it's almost certainly the same thief/thieves. Why? Because that's the easiest way for an exchange or mixer to know whose account some funds they just received go to: only use an address for one account, ever.

This is laughably incorrect. $40 in 1971 has the same real purchasing power as $238 in 2014. ([source: historical CPI]( Inflation-adjusted median household incomes have [gone up slightly]( but not nearly enough to offset a 6x factor.

Yep, you've got the general idea right.


It cannot, even in theory: two people now have the private key, and you can't prove (to the network, I mean; I'm sure you could prove it in a court of law, for example) who had it first. In practice, most vulnerabilities will not allow trivial hacking of every address. Rather, it would likely still be difficult (something like the progression of MD5 collisions from thought-to-be-secure to trivially-broken was not overnight). The advice would then be to move your coins to a new, secure address as soon as possible.

Greatest current difficulty is not the same as most total work. Most total work wins.
E.g. imagine two chains: one that went to a high difficulty and stayed there for a year, and another that was at a low difficulty for 10 months and then jumped up to a difficulty just above the other in the last two months. The best chain is the former (high difficulty the whole time), because it has the most total work.

Transferring back to Coinbase is unnecessary. It may be good for small transactions (eliminate fees because they can do it off-blockchain) or transactions that you'd like to have an instant confirmation on (again, off-blockchain, trusting Coinbase), but otherwise: you can spend directly from Electrum.

Your salary will be taxed, because the company you work for is required to report your income and doesn't cheat on their taxes. Your spending will be taxed, because the store you buy stuff from is required to pay sales tax, and they can pass that tax on to you directly.
If the govt still wants their taxes in USD, then you (or the store, in the case of sales tax) will have to sell some of your bitcoins to pay that. But they could even collect taxes in bitcoins, too, in theory.
The only thing that'd change is that it'd be easier in many ways (e.g. don't have to mess with cash) to do things "under the table" and avoid the taxes that are in place.
Basically, we aren't taxed because we use USD. We're taxed because we live and work here. Sorry, try again.

Any bank or PayPal should never ask you to send a password to them because they have a backdoor access into your account. Only people getting in through the front door need the password.
Blockchain.info has no backdoor access or other way to verify what addresses you have, so they may need the password. Obviously, you should never use this password elsewhere (if you do, change the password and give them the *new* one) or use this wallet again. And they should provide a secure form on their web site to submit your password, not sent over email (unless there's a PGP key you can use to encrypt it).

See ["Want" vs. "Need"]( We do not *need* to use bits instead of BTC. You think it's a good idea. Alternatives:

* I think we should use the "bit"...
* We should use the "bit"...
* Let's use the "bit"...
Personally, I think the "bit" is a confusing, bad idea. If you prefer to use smaller units than BTC, attach the standard SI prefixes: milliBTC and microBTC. Not some different thing that is named in a way that conflicts with "Bitcoin" and "bit" (which is already a word with several meanings: binary digit, thing in a horse's mouth, small amount, etc.).

You're making some big assumptions about the number of transactions and the number of miners we need to sustain. If people refuse to pay $1-$10 for transactions, miners will still mine - but the total hashrate, the total security in terms of economic cost and strength, will be lower, to compensate for this.
Basically, the block reward is currently subsidizing some $2M/day in security. Do we really need that much? Probably not.

Theoretically, no. In practice (in almost every case), yes, it requires *some* amount of trust: that the code base doesn't have a long-undiscovered bug, and that changes are watched closely enough to prevent misconduct. And that no silently-exploitable backdoors are in the code (either old or new), and that they don't so badly mishandle the product and/or community that nobody would fork it and maintain it suitably.
Note the "silently-exploitable" requirement on exploits, though: if the developers suddenly used an exploit (old or new) that, say, transfers all the money to them, the community could easily fork it to fix the exploit, and nobody would use the bad "Bitcoin" maintained by the original developers.

One option would be **disruptive mining** in an extreme &gt;51% attack. Using  as a benchmark, $182 million could buy you the network's current hashrate of ~330 PH/s, so buy up to $10 billion worth of miners, which is ~18189 PH/s, or ~55 times the network's current hashrate. (I think it's reasonable to assume that if you approached a company and give them a $10 billion budget to build the best ASICs possible, you'd get *far more* hash power for that money than a company's off-the-shelf retail price, so the reality would be even stronger than what follows...which is nice because you'd actually have to spend part of your $10 billion on power &amp; facilities, salaries, etc.)
**Mine your own chain that is free of real transactions** (you can throw in ones to/from yourself if you want to make it harder to detect). All Bitcoin trading is frozen, and as it becomes clear what's going on, their value drops to near-nothing. Miners begin to shut off as they realize it's not profitable to compete with a &gt;51% miner that ignores your blocks.
Run your miners just hard enough to **push the difficulty up** at the maximum rate of 4x until you get to your actual difficulty level, then **shut them all off**. The current network power's honest miners can now only mine at an average rate of 3 blocks per day, give or take. Since miners have been dropping off, it's even less than that, likely less than 1 block per day (1 per week would not surprise me).
When someone else mines a block, use your hash power (you'd only need &lt;2% of it) to run a 51% attack keeping the best chain free of transactions. Recovering Bitcoin would require that the honest miners get more hash power than you, but honest miners *won't bother* to mine something that pays them nothing. **Bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, dead.**
The only way I can see to prevent an attack like this in a pure PoW coin like Bitcoin is that honest miners have more hash power than any government (or coalition of governments) can produce. I don't see that happening, at least any time in the near future.

Is this basically the same as setting up a recurring buy at Coinbase? But with the amount based on your transaction history? I could do approximately the same thing by calculating how many transactions I have per month, dividing by 2, and buying that many dollars worth of Bitcoin every month...
Seems pretty pointless to me, honestly, except that it exploits the psychological side of buying something like Bitcoin: it may be easier to automatically buy &lt;$1 100 times than to spend $50 all at once.

I do the same thing. Sounds good to me, but if anyone can tell me that it's insecure, I'd want to hear it.

I must disagree due to bad implementations, not bad theories. If insufficiently-secure "random" values are chosen when signing, multiple signatures from the same public key (address) can reveal the private key. This can and has happened. You can largely sidestep the issue by never signing two messages/transactions with the same public key.

There are all sorts of vulnerabilities that can crop up, some more fatal than others. Let's assume this is one of the most fatal ones imaginable: anyone with knowledge of the public key can trivially find the private key. Any coins sent to a public key, or to an address that has also spent or signed anything are now compromised. The only uncompromised coins are ones sent to an address that has not spent yet. (if we assume that SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 are also broken along with the elliptic curve crypto, then even these coins are compromised, along with the mining process, and it's all over - start a new coin from scratch with all new algorithms)
The ultimate broken-crypto "game over" scenario is where every output on the blockchain is compromised. Anything less than that *might* be recoverable.
Let's say that you patch the code so that there's a new, secure crypto with different addresses, and you can send from old broken-crypto addresses to the new ones.
When you broadcast a transaction, you must include your public key and signature authorizing the transaction. If you publicly broadcast a transaction, any node can replace your transaction with one spending the coins to their own address, and there's no way to tell who the rightful owner of the key is. The only way to get your transaction to reliably enter the blockchain is by mining it yourself, or sending it to trusted miner(s) and having them mine it. (holding some secure coins in escrow could be enough to make this work with minimal trust of the miner: if they replace it with their own transaction, you get the coins from the escrow instead) If your coins were valuable enough to attract attention, you might have to worry that a dishonest and powerful-enough miner will attempt to 'rewind' the blockchain and spend your coins to their own address (and then make that chain the longest). This means that a 51% attack now has the potential to steal many coins.
Another way I just thought of to help is to implement something like what Namecoin has to prevent people stealing a domain right when you want it: It should be possible to implement some sort of "proof of unbroadcast transaction", that has to enter the blockchain x blocks (e.g. 6 or 144) before you broadcast your transaction. Then when the time is up, you broadcast your transaction, and everyone checks that the txid was in an earlier proof before accepting it: that way, it doesn't matter that the private key is now public information.
So actually, I guess you're kind of right: even totally broken crypto can be recovered from without totally resetting the blockchain, but much more painfully than "push out a patch, it'll all be alright".

Just to clarify, since I think your first sentence is misleading...


Keeping your private key private is of the utmost importance. It's only not a real worry here because...

The point isn't that you can complain to Bitcoin and have "Bitcoin" give the customer's money to you. It's that **you** know who your customer is and **you** have records saying "they paid $100/0.3 BTC with txid 0a2f... (and that txid is no longer in the main chain)". And then you send them an email. Or a letter. Or a letter saying "I'm suing you."
This won't apply to some online businesses, and others may just write it off as a loss, especially for small amounts, but if someone put a multi-million-dollar order in through Dell, for example, they sure know who's doing the ordering (if only by knowing where to ship it).

Yeah, I just put that in there to make a point: off-blockchain systems like Coinbase are supposed to make micropayments easy. What's the point of that if they then reject micropayments? And, more annoyingly, do so *after* making you enter your 2FA.
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:43:36


Yes, if you're not too careful about knowing what address to send to, a malicious MITM can modify the address. This is not just a concern with wifi but with any connection. If you get the address from a secure source (e.g. HTTPS web site), this is not an issue.
For this reason, you should *always* be careful about the source of the address: if it's an unencrypted connection, assume it's compromised.

I'm still holding out hope that Bitcoin will become big, and it certainly has the potential to go big after a slow start, but why hasn't it caught on yet in a mainstream way?

If the details of this vulnerability were publicly known, it would definitely drop to $0. Game over. Start a new coin with better cryptography.
If only one person knew the vulnerability and did something blatantly obvious like stealing all bitcoins where the public key is known (note that many are locked up in addresses where the public key is *not* known until you spend from that address, so at best the attacker could wait until a legitimate transaction is broadcast from that address, and then issue a double-spend transaction where he also tries to spend the coins), Bitcoin would likely drop to $0.  
But if he were more discreet, he could steal coins without people noticing.


This would be fixed with a patch in short order, and wouldn't have to kill Bitcoin.

Below "Pay with Credit Card" (which uses Stripe) is "Other payment options...", which has a Bitcoin option via Coinbase. At least in the US.
I'm not sure why having Bitcoin go through Stripe instead would be better...would that enable it internationally?

That would actually work. Create transactions sending, say, 1 million bitcoins between addresses 50 times. Mine all of those transactions in one block.

The cash discount applies to: ["check, money order, cashier's check, or bank wire"]( not physical cash (which they don't appear to accept). With the right bank, these don't cost you a thing to receive. (of course, for the physical ones here you're still paying someone to take the time to take these things out of the envelopes, apply them to the order, cash them, etc., but I'd expect this is a low cost)
