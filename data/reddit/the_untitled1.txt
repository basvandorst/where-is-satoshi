Cut it out with the hostile attitude already. There's nothing wrong with a Dogecoiner being a mod here.

Not sure if you just aren't managing to word your point properly or if you genuinely believe that gambling has more utility than houses and kids.

How on Earth did you come to the conclusion that OP was saying to never take risks?
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:14:18
What's your point? I haven't been active in the Dogecoin community for months, and even then my activity was low. I identify as a Bitcoiner because I prefer Bitcoin to Dogecoin.
I feel like you're dodging my question.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:08:00
That's a possibility, but we're going to get newbies no matter what. In recent weeks we've had a bunch of Dogecoiners post here saying that they're making the leap from Dogecoin to Bitcoin.
It does have its pros and cons, of course, but I don't see why Bitcoin and Dogecoin can't just live peacefully side by side: they can have their whacky fun and the people that are interested in a more serious CryptoCurrency can move to Bitcoin. Win-win, in theory.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:39:58
What does their preference in crypto currencies have to do with their ability to moderate?
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:17:14
So because gambling is a risk, all risks are gambling?
Not sure I follow your logic. All OP was saying was to not gamble, not to never do anything remotely risky.

When I first got into Bitcoin I spent 0.7 BTC on alpaca socks when the price was $60 a coin. Price shot up a week after I bought it.
I also bought a shirt for 0.4 BTC when the price was like $130. Few days after that the price started going up to $1200.
So to answer your question, I don't spend my Bitcoin anymore. It's definitely encouraged me to save, but it's mostly out of fear. I do love a good price-rollercoaster, but when the price can fluctuate like that buying things becomes hard. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:43:33

Heh, I was considering writing dogeing but thought it was the wrong choice of word. I'll know better next time.
I don't understand it either, but it's getting really annoying to see anti-doge content on the front page, it's just off topic.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:52:47
Thank you! I really don't understand the hostility. From where I stand, Dogecoin is a fun entrance to Bitcoin, and they are vital if we are ever going to go mainstream. If you don't like them, ignore them.
The data is interesting, but the post seems to be centred on proving that we're better than Dogecoin, which I'm against.

While I definitely don't agree with Apple's actions, I don't think that spamming them is going to do anything but harm our reputation. They didn't give a shit when the iPhone smashing was going on, and they sure as hell aren't going to care if you spam them.
You have a right to "encourage change", but don't bring the reputation of a community down with you.
I repeat again: spamming them will cause us harm and cause pretty much nothing to them.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:02:43
Well, going only from what you linked to, they asked if something could accept Dogecoin: so what? Their job is to delete spam, that shouldn't get in the way of their ability to do so.
Also, if you don't want to argue with a Dogecoiner that's fine: because I'm a Bitcoiner. So feel free to start an argument with me.

This shit with Apple is getting on my nerves. The iPhone smashing was ridiculous and embarrassing enough but now you want to harrass them by spamming their social media?

@_date: 2014-06-05 20:07:38
You're right, wording was bad on my part, but explained it pretty well: Dogecoin acts as a very good introduction to CryptoCurrencies, which is why being hostile to it is a silly thing for Bitcoiners to do. We should just leave them alone.

I just don't think it'll make a difference, even if the campaign is good natured: they must know that the community's pissed off about it, but nothing has been done or even said. The best thing you can do is vote with your wallet and not buy Apple products, I really can't think of a better way of going about things.
I fail to see how "I say we flood social media &amp; news with questions about why they are anti-tech &amp; anti Bitcoin" can be taken as anything but a call for spamming, but let's agree to disagree.

@_date: 2015-04-19 01:32:12
Hang on. The fact that this subreddit exists is **proof** that Bitcoin is going to be worth a lot of money?
What is logic.
@_date: 2013-08-19 11:53:55
Yeah. Much, much more secure.
When you print a paper wallet the two keys - public and private - are on there. You can use a Bitcoin phone app to scan the public key and send Bitcoins to it, and that binds those Bitcoins to the public key, which is printed on your paper wallet. When you want to regain access to those Bitcoins you just scan the Private Key QR code and then you properly own those Bitcoins again. This means that literally the only way someone could gain access to the Bitcoins on your paper wallet would be to have your paper wallet.
As for giving someone a paper wallet containing Bitcoins: that would be pretty much the same as handing someone cash, but with a few security issues. There's a chance that the person handing the paper wallet to you has a backup of the paper wallet, so they can just reclaim those Bitcoins; and for that reason giving someone cash in return for a paper wallet isn't a good idea, because that same someone could just take your money and reclaim their Bitcoins by using a paper wallet backup. Which is why just using a normal Bitcoin transaction is the safest way to transfer BTC.
In conclusion: paper wallets are best used as a medium of storage, rather than a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2013-09-08 09:56:28
I think that some sort of password protection would be better, to be honest. Less irritating for the players.
@_date: 2013-07-22 12:34:24
Your bitcoin address is just a public key. The worst anyone can do with your bitcoin address is send you money, so you're safe in that regard. :P

If you're referring to Blackjack, then yes, that is indeed a problem. There is a way that play money players can slightly improve the odds of real money players (which I won't elaborate on for obvious reasons). But I think that play money is vital to BitVegas, and it's perfect the way it is. I think that if we change the way it's used then it will just be confusing.
Also that bitcents pun was incredible. Made me chuckle. :P

Normally you can connect to the server using a free guest account but due to technical difficulties with the new Minecraft version we've had to temporarily disable that feature.

@_date: 2013-08-22 10:40:18
Buying paper wallets for cash is almost as risky as selling Bitcoins for Paypal. You have no way of knowing that the seller doesn't have a backup of that paper wallet saved somewhere and thus still have access to the private key.
Potentially, the seller could just reclaim the private key and take back the Bitcoins they sold you. This, I guess can be solved if you claim the private key and then move the Bitcoins the hell out of that address right away (assuming it was given to you in person), but there's always the chance that the seller might do so before you.

µBTC (a.k.a Micro Bitcoin) is a unit of BTC: 1 µBTC = 0.000001 BTC. 15.724 µBTC = $0.01135.

It depends how you look at it, really.
Personally, I'm more interested in seeing how Bitcoin can work as a payment processor on a larger scale. It's hard to say which option is more important, though, since I think that at this point it's a matter of opinion. Having said that, a stable price would make promoting Bitcoin much easier.

@_date: 2013-09-26 10:25:49
Either way, people who write news articles regarding Bitcoin should stop sticking pictures of Casascius coins on their articles. It's just not an accurate representation of what Bitcoin is, and it gives people the wrong idea.

@_date: 2013-05-21 21:23:20
I don't think that's going to be done. It's a little tedious to make a separate casino for play money mode. Since there are more games now it won't really make a difference, if those do start filling up with play-money-ers, then I'm sure we'll figure something out. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Also, someone pointed this out to me in a PM and I think it's worth noting: when I say "We" I'm referring to me and the other builders of the new casino. I'm not representing the casino itself, nor am I an admin. I'm just answering questions about the changes being made to the casino.

Generally a wallet installed on your computer is safer, because you are totally in control of your coins rather than having to trust a third party.
The only problem with this is that it takes roughly two days to synchronise with the Block Chain. If you want a pretty much instant wallet, use an online one (I use Blockchain.info).

Well all games are tested a lot. If someone finds a bug they just report it and it get fixed. I think there's actually rewards for finding bugs, but I'm not entirely sure.
As for client-side hacks, they can't do anything malicious. Hackers can fly around and noclip and stuff like that but there's no way to actually hack the games.

Hey there, I'm not the owner of the Minecraft Bitcoin Casino (BitVegas), but I am however a staff member.
We prefer to keep the casino accessible to everyone without having to go through the install of a mod. Currently all our games are custom coded plugins which require no mods at all, and we keep it that way for that reason.
In theory, we could do a LOT more with mods than we currently can do with a normal Minecraft client. But that would pretty much obliterate the level of accessibility that we currently have. I for one can't be bothered to install mods, which is why I don't play on servers which require the download of mods.
I say this because this mod uses Forge, which requires both a plugin to be installed on the server and the client to be installed my the player. I personally think this is too tedious. It's also especially tedious if not impossible to do with our guest feature on the website.
I'm not saying this is a bad idea, hell I think it'd work great with some games, but it's just not practical.
And then of course we have the owner being very "kosher" - so to speak - about using third party plugins; he prefers to use his own.
I dunno, perhaps the owner will have something else to say on the matter, but those are my views.
Also, there's that Mod API that Mojang has been yapping on about for months and not implemented yet, perhaps it'll get more feasible with the launch of that. I'll definitely suggest the mod (or something similar to it) if/when the Mod API is released.
@_date: 2013-07-21 07:30:29
Hmmmm... I've actually been planning to announce a product which stores Bitcoins in the coming weeks, this could be a problem... Does having a private key QR code on a product fall under the category of "physical bitcoins and paper wallets" according to the patent?

I whole-heartedly agree with everything you said there. 
In my opinion Bitcoin is a brilliant technology, but shoving it down people's throats just gives it a bad name - and that's an especially bad idea considering its value is derived from trust.
Simply the fact that such a huge deal has been made from this small comment from Max surprises me. Reading through some of the comments on the [original post]( almost makes me ashamed to be a Bitcoiner. I thought the people here were above [circlejerky comments ]( [these.](
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:23:32

@_date: 2013-07-21 09:57:05
Right. I doubt it'll actually go through, but even if it does it could take a few years. I think I'll announce my product anyway and if it goes through I'll stop producing it.

Murderscene was actually developing a bitvegas version of Hunger Games a while back, similar to Mcpvp's hunger games. The idea was that all tributes bet, the house takes a percentage, and the winner takes the rest. Unfortunately he had to ditch this idea because of how easy it is to hack MC. If you're playing with high stakes, getting killed by some hacker would suck. So unless we can find or develop a flawless anticheat plugin (unlikely), this idea will remain dead.
However, we do plan on adding PvP games in the future, just not PvP games which can be hacked. Currently we're thinking of adding Battleships and Connect Four. These won't be added for a while, though. The owner needs to finish developing poker first.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:29:17
Will do. It'll probably be after the initial launch of the new casino. We'll still be adding updates and new games after the launch. We HOPE to launch at the week end, if everything goes to plan.

Right then, I assume you're talking about paper wallets. To explain this we first have to explain the difference between public and private keys.
Public keys are random combinations of numbers and letters which always start with a 1. They're also known as Bitcoin Adresses. Public keys essentially act as identifiers that store Bitcoins. You can send Bitcoins to and from an address (public key), but you can only send from an address so long as the address is owned by you.
But there are also private keys. Private keys are like passwords which you use to gain access to Bitcoins on a public key. Each Public Key has a Private Key counterpart, and if you gain access to the private key you gain access to the bitcoins on the Public key.
I mention this becase paper wallets are, in essence, just private keys printed on paper. Sometimes as QR codes and sometimes just written out (most of the time it's both). Sticking a private key on something pretty much binds the Bitcoins on that public/private key to it, which is why products like [Casascius physical Bitcoins]( work so well.
All in all, paper wallets are just a more secure way to store bitcoins. It's a lot easier to keep a physical object safe than your computer safe.
You can head to bitaddress.org and click on the "paper wallet" tab to see an example of what a paper wallet looks like.
If you have any further questions I'd be happy to answer. :P

*sigh* Seems to me you weren't around during the dark days, my friend.

Murderscene had a version of poker running for a while but it's too buggy and unstable. So once that's fixed, it'll be added.

Was just about to point this out. I can't stand it when the foundation is referred to as "Bitcoin".

Just so you know, 1700 uBTC is 1.7 mBTC, not BTC.

Fair enough, but why would they take down the facebook post announcing it to everyone, if they wanted to prevent a flip-out?
Regarding the tweet: They totally avoided the question. I can't even understand what they were trying to say. Maybe, just maybe they meant that the LTC rumour was official by saying "Its an official one.", but they could have made it a hell of a lot clearer.

Aesthetic* :P
Anyway yeah, the new casino has multiple floors, so we could add more games on each floor. Now you don't have to wait for Minefield or Blackjack when there are a lot of people on! (I was also involved in the building process.)

Was wondering the same thing, actually.
Although you are definitely right about the socks, they are most definitely fantastic. Received my pair a few weeks ago and when you wear them it's like a hundred alpacas are softly kissing your feet.

So let me get this straight:
Casascius gets shut down despite being a perfectly legitimate business, yet no legal action is being taken against Butterfly Labs for essentially scamming people out of coins.
Really struggling to see the sense in this one.

Or both.

Ah, well if so, yes. We are planning to add a shop in which there's a big billboard with a painting on it. The idea is people will be able to buy advertising space in the shop, design their own ad and have the painting reskinned to that advert. We're still figuring it out but it's most likely going to happen.

Not really, no. Vanilla clients and modded clients aren't compatible with each other. We can't have both, it's either-or.
The only way I can think of is having two separate servers: one vanilla and one Forge for this mod; but that just doesn't seem worth it for a screen.

True, but it's still a lot easier to continue as we are now.
We're going to be using maps as GUIs for some of our new games in development, such as poker. So I guess we can substitute this web browser with a map and some clever coding.

What exactly do you mean by sponsors?
