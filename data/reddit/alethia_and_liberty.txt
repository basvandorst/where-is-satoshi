No, it absolutely wouldn’t be. The entire bitcoin network would have to upgrade. The block size increase failed to reach consensus and this is exactly why we have Bitcoin Cash. Small blocks are necessary to ensure decentralization, which is the most important feature of Bitcoin.

They could be batching, so, instead of using multiple outputs, they're unnecessarily bloating blocks.

 - setup a node

 - read bug reports and try to reproduce
 - learn how to code for nodes or wallets
 - translate GUIs / articles to languages you know
 - teach others how to securely and safely store coins

The complaint is that the fees could be smaller in your transaction *from* Coinbase to your wallet; those who use Coinbase as their wallet have no right to complain.

I agree with you, in general. We've seen these waves come and go. However, it's exactly those who are new and legit and want to learn that are most susceptible to the FUDing (which is the only ATH around these parts right now). 
Maybe we could have a stickied new-comers thread for help, with automoderator not set up on that thread. That way, it'd be easier to see who is legitimately needing help vs. those who are obviously trolling.

The economics of bitcoin have been balancing out for years. If they do this, they risk falling behind on mining fees, while their competitors can mine the highest fee transactions while also capturing the block reward. Eventually, they'll lose profit, and be unable to continue this attack.

There are few people in this world who I dislike more than Paul Krugman.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:24:00
My reasons, in order:
1. Because Bitcoin is the coin with the greatest codebase, network (nodes), community, proof-of-work accumulation, brand-name, and body of knowledge.
2. Because the world's central banks are destroying their currencies, and Bitcoin is the purest form of money. Many nations (populations) are increasingly wary of trusting their governments; Bitcoin is the only pure exit.
3. Because in a digital age, a first-level internet protocol that allows one to transmit money securely without a third-party is a necessity, let alone an inevitability.
4. Because the world needs a non-governmental monetary policy that is uniform across nations, and unable to be changed to bail out/in nations/banks who are intentionally malicious actors.
5. Because finance is the largest sector that hasn't yet been disrupted; it's ripe for the pickings.

I'd encourage you to also take a look at Gemini, as most of this recent chaos was spurred on by Coinbase's reckless unannounced listing of BCH, with what seems to be clear insider trading / leaks. Gemini might not get you confirmed immediately, but you'll be paying less over the long term.

A few things to strengthen your hands, and for you to experience really bitcoin, and not "custodial" bitcoin (as AA calls it).
1. Buy a hardware wallet, like a Ledger Nano S
2. Learn how it works, backup the seed physically (not digitally)
3. Withdraw your coins from the exchange (while GDAX still pays the network transaction fee, which they may stop doing at any point)
That way, if you *really* want to sell, you have to make the decision to really part with your coins.

 - Charlie Lee **just happened** to sell all of his Litecoin before the BCH listing and subsequent market-wide crash
 - Coinbase conspired to announce BCH withdrawals available on January 1st, then announces instantaneous roll-out and listing of BCH pairs
 - Roger Ver was scheduled to go on CNBC the next day, proceeds to say insider trading isn't a problem/crime, says you should want more of it.

Those contrary voices decided to fork-away. After voicing their opinion, they have made their decision to exit. Bitcoin is decentralized, but it is a “thing”, which over and over again has cohered as a protocol overlapping a community. Overwhelmingly, evidenced by the direction of the forks, the community has valued the protocol decisions which favor decentralization and security on the chain, with scaling on second layers. If someone doesn’t agree with that, they should choose a different coin.

You don’t understand what is going on at all...
Bitcoins are made with massive amounts of electricity, not out of thin air. The difficulty targets in the network prohibit miners from just arbitrarily speeding up the finding of the next block (the mining of new coins) and thus they can not be created “out of nothing”.  If the Fed Reserve wanted to multiply the M1 by 10x out of nowhere they could do it instantly by decree; there is no way that anyone could stop them.

Blockchain.info is a site that is notorious for security problems: 
In general, here's the difference between a web wallet (or an exchange) and using a secure wallet:
Questions you have to ask with web wallets:
 - are you using a secure browser with no known vulnerabilities?
 - do you re-use passwords across sites?
 - are your passwords sufficiently complex?
 - does your computer have any viruses?
 - does the site/page where you host your wallet (enter your key) have any vulnerabilities?
 - are you positive that you've only entered your password only on the appropriate sites?
 - are you sure there are no key-loggers in your keyboard, computer, OS, or browser?
 - are you sure there are no screen-loggers in your OS or browser?
Questions you have to ask with hardware wallets:
 - does someone have your hardware wallet and know your PIN?
 - (and optionally) do you have your coins under a single-sig (normal) configuration?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:37:48

Exactly. Keep it secret.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:10:23
Decentralization requires that every node is able to confirm the blocks as fast as they are produced. Decrease the blocktime, and you increase the hardware required to confirm the new block. As soon as your machine can't keep up with the generation time, you're hosed. Increase the blocksize, and you increase the storage required to run a full node, *and* the hardware requirements for confirmation (more txs to confirm). 
It's an equilibrium.

All value is attributed.
price !== value !== utility
Suppose I pay $100 USD for a pair of headphones; if I never put them on, I may attribute value to them (a mental / volitional feeling about them), but they have no provided utility. On the other hand, if someone gives me the headphones ($0 USD), and end up using them for years, they have provided a lot of utility, and I can still value them.
Value does however have *hard limits*, where it reaches things perceived as needs. I need water, food, shelter to live. If pressed, I'm going to spend money on food, water, and shelter before I spend money of art, music, and movies. By the very reality of bodily existence, I can't not value things that keep me alive (double negative used intentionally for effect).

This July, I finally understood what Bitcoin is. I decided to buy. I went to Coinbase to make an account, but it said I already had one. Confused, I reset the password and thought nothing of it. After recovering the password, I signed in and proceeded to confirm. I was exploring the interface and decided to look at the activity tab. I signed up for an account in 2013 and never did anything else. 
What is weird is I really don’t remember being too jazzed about it in 2013, but I was curious enough to create an account. If only I had done my homework more back then.

That's not true at all.

That's about $1 million USD. That's not just people shifting coins to different wallets. And that's way beyond the volume of the activity on the exchanges in that same period.

It doesn’t matter if it is or isn’t the case that it’s “spiraling”, it’s absolutely critical to the way Bitcoin works.

I’m in your exact same scenario and demographic. Though I fully expect BTC to go to 25k within 5 years, I think this is a terrible idea. You need an emergency fund in fiat to pay for expenses that can not be foreseen. If you are out of dry powder, stop shooting.

What is difficult about the empty block problem is that the blockchain is the shared state across the nodes. So if you have a second source of of shared state (a "mempool" locking mechanism), then you have to have establish consensus on the resource (transactions) by which you gain consensus (blocks).
Seems like a hard problem to solve to fix a less-hard problem (miner centrality).
I'm not convinced that the miners are the single greatest problem in bitcoin. Scaling / 2nd layer is much more important imho.

Read the white paper; it’s how bitcoin prevents the double spend problem. Transactions get included into blocks, and older blocks are harder to overwrite.

@_date: 2017-11-10 17:25:40
AFAIK: the protocol doesn't prevent this, and it really can't, because the "mempool" isn't a part of the block chain, it's just a good-faith shared state between nodes. So the network can't reject a block from a miner without transactions, because there's no way to guarantee that the miner knew about the transactions that others know about.

The distribution of wealth is not the current issue. The current issue is the devaluation of  real wealth in the hands of the people through the central banking systems. In our world today, value is transferred away from the creators of wealth, the people, for the bank can create notes (dollars) which are of the same form as those held by the public. They in turn pass these dollars on to the public-serving banks, who then lend out notes to individuals who are credit worthy, who take on risks raising the real prices of homes, goods, businesses. This in turn pushes out the “bag holders” (savers) from the market, creating unfair competition.
Bitcoin is honest money, not socialism.

This is the whole reason I like Bitcoin. It's a better monetary policy; one not which is based on, and encourages, debt.

Why is our nation (USA) so much more deeply in debt than we've ever been in before?
Because our monetary policy rewards those who take on debt: when given low interest rates, with consistent prices between cash and credit, it is always smarter to purchase items with future (devalued) dollars that using today's dollars. This is why debt has consumed every aspect of the economy: federal, state, and local government, housing, student loans, credit cards, and auto loans. 
Deflationary currencies encourage financial responsibility by utilizing only the smallest amount of debt, and only for those things which are very likely to generate profitable returns. This actively discourages wanton use of credit and their corresponding bubbles; such as in housing (2008) and student loans (20??).

This is one of my favorites, as it is proof that just because you yourself have been in a break-through doesn't mean that you have good predictive powers concerning future events. A corollary of confirmation bias.

What if Abe or Bob die? What if someone in your family, who knows about your coins, finds your contact book and then sends a blast email with Abe and Bob in the "to:" column, asking if anyone knew about Mom/Dad's bitcoin holdings and then they discover each other. What if Bitcoin goes to $100m USD and Abe and Bob sell their portion of the seed to a 3rd party who deem it worth brute-forcing the rest of the seed.
You should just do a Shamir share within your family to begin with.

Move your coins off the exchange, because you're at the mercy of the exchange to give you the new coins. Or in this case, to decide whether or not Bitcoin or Segwit2XCoin is the "real" bitcoin.

Right, but exactly when Coinbase does this is at their sole disgression.  Coinbase customers haven't even received their bitcoin cash (BCH) yet. And they probably won't until January.
