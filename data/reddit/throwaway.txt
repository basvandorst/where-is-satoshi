Except for the bragging that he knows who Satoshi is and isn't going to tell us.  He should make a cryptographic commitment on it!

An FBI swat team will be exploding through your windows any moment now.

Sounds like a fast track to a beheading. :-)

Do you know how much the legal fees are likely to come to?

I love this kind of stuff.  $3 @_date: 2015-01-23 05:05:17
What is the purpose of all these objections?  Dratel is still getting to sow doubt in the juror's minds, and he pulls out the same thing three times in a row with no sanctions.

Yes, this is very valuable.

This is awesome!  Is there a way for the server being audited to prevent the auditor from verifiying the audited page, say by only allowing it to be viewed once?

Actually, running The Silk Road *is* illegal in and of itself.  It is conspiracy to traffic in drugs, and there is plenty of that in the Ulbricht complaint to pin on Ulbricht.  With what the defense has said so far, he's still going to prison for a long time, even in the best outcome the defense could hope for.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:48:29
You could do it fairly easily but if caught you would go to jail for several years yourself, the judge would declare a mistrail (i.e., they'd start again from scratch), and it would have pretty ugly political ramifications for anything associated with Ulbricht.  Trying to persuade a jury member out of band is a very serious offence, for good reasons.

He's not a New Zealander.  This is part of why he's vulnerable to extradition to the US.

Thanks for the info.  I'd read a bit more and found the TLS 1.2 restriction.  Is there a workaround for that, at least in theory?
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:57:22
How did he run it into the ground?  I wasn't paying close attention at the time MK is alleged to have been running it.

Yes, I've noticed that.  The part where he wanted to talk about mastermind.php was painful.  None of the three of them really had a clear idea of what they were talking about.

I'll start being impressed when they raise an army which plausibly give pause to whatever nation-state believes it has dominion over its claimed territory.
@_date: 2015-09-28 06:34:20
Great read!  I don't believe it, but it was fun!

  &gt; It is not illegal to make your own money.  It is protected in the constitution. 
Can you point me to the relevant part?

The IRS doctrine on this kind of thing is that any kind of structuring to minimize taxes should be taxed as if it were not so structured.  So paying in bitcoin does not in any way get you off the hook, legally speaking.  Some people might gamble that the IRS is so far behind on this that they won't catch up until the statute of limitations expires on current taxes.  Personally, I think that would be rather silly.
Anyway, this ignores the issue of finding employees willing to work for something as price-volatile as bitcoin.  Good luck with that....

  &gt; New serivces are popping up daily, more organizations are accepting Bitcoin as either donations or for purchases, and new ideas and information are stirring in every corner.
I keep hearing assertions like this, but I'm yet to see any evidence for them.  Have you been taking a survey of available bitcoin services?
@_date: 2011-10-13 20:24:48
This will just speed the inflation of bitcoin if it takes off.  Once people figure out how to convert the bitcoins to dollars, that's exactly what they'll do.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:39:35
Yes, the key thing to keep in mind is that the FBI could take as long as they needed to physically surveil Ulbricht and identify his weaknesses.

There's a successful [indictment in Maryland for it](

I'm curious about whether that's the case if he makes the passphrase something like "YES, I AM GUILTY OF ALL I STAND ACCUSED OF AND DESERVE THE HARSHEST POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT...  HELLO, JUDGE, ARE YOU ENJOYING THIS IN-CAMERA  REVIEW?  CAN I TAKE THE 5TH NOW???"
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:37:44


That's totally possible, actually.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:29:48
Not the FBI as far as anyone knows, anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:10:20
I see no evidence that liberte encrypts RAM.  Could you please provide some?
Also, it seems like their last release was in 2012.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:41:52


It would be fairly simple to tie the server to him using a timing correlation attack based on controlling his local internet access.  The FBI actually used this technique to nail one of the Anonymous suspects.
