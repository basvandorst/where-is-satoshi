Yeah exactly, and getting rid of the FDA would basically make this the case with all products. It would make this much worse. It's already like this in other countries like India and Mexico. We're probably well on our way to joining them because of this idiotic attitude

It literally makes us safer than not having it at all. Have you been to countries where companies aren't required to put anything on the label for ingredients? Just because the FDA is flawed doesn't mean that we don't need protection from corporate greed. They don't give a fuck about us and will only do what's best for the bottom line/shareholders

Like all the roads oh drive on? Or all the unseen regulation that went into making your vehicle safe to drive or safe from other drivers? I'll never agree that free unregulated market will solve any problem other than 'the bottom line'. That's it's only function. It's just like you said, and I agree with you, where is there room in there for them to care about'special snowflakes(human life)' vs profit/loss. There is non outside of PR

I totally agree with this point, just not that the FDA should be destroyed because it's flawed. It has some very good, very necessary functions. Like makin sure our food is relatively safe, unlike in some other countries. Why not just say that the shit bag that is the DEA should be done away with? Not sure how they're helping us at all

Fair point

Anyway, thanks for having this conversation with me. I don't often get to talk with people that have such a different view on these things, and I think it's healthy to do so. I really appreciate that you're able to talk about this stuff passionately without name calling or throwing around dismissive remarks. Good shit

Are you serious? Car companies make decisions to not recall dangerous defects depending on the projected costs of lawsuits weighed against the cost of the recall. They don't give a fuck. They care about the bottom line. You're delusional to think otherwise. And I don't need to do all that annoying, expensive shit to keep myself safe from food companies right now because I pay taxes and some of that $ goes to the FDA and they do it for me. It might not be perfect but it's better than having to sue companies that lets say risked some cheaper ingredients that maybe gave me cancer to get a good 4th quarter in and make their mark in the business world. The bottom line is more powerful than people. It's the invisible monster we're all slaves to. Steinbeck pointed it out so well in grapes of wrath

Yeah that's usually the correct answer with this type of logic 
@_date: 2017-01-13 00:30:54
It's so frustrating to read stupid shit like this. "The DMV is annoying and has long lines! Let's blow it up!!" Or " the military messes up sometimes, let's dismantle it and hire private, less accountable security firms instead" 
Everything humans do is flawed. The FDA isn't perfect, like any group of humans anywhere, but yeah, I like to know what the fuck is in my food and have some accountability for companies to not cut corners in the name of profit and end up with even worse poisons in there. 
Shortsighted, simple minded motherfuckers need to stop trying to destroy the dysfunctional organizations that do their dysfunctional best try to keep the populous safe from corporate greed. That's one of governments most serious functions. They're playing right into corporate manipulation with that "it's flawed so burn it all down" attitude. Who the fuck else is going to care about that type of shit? The companies themselves? You think the market will regulate that shit? How the fuck can people even stop buying potentially harmful products if they don't even know they're harmful?? 
I read shit like that and I feel hopeless. We're fucked, and I guess we deserve it.

No one mentioned Hillary except you. Trump is the one that appointed Sessions. Trump. Trump did that. Nothing to do with Hillary. She didn't make Trump appoint Sessions. Who knows who she would've ended up appointing had she won. It doesn't matter. What we do know is what did happen. Trump appointed Jeff fucking Sessions.

Yeah dude I'm not saying they're not flawed or fucked up or abused systems but I'd rather keep them and try to force the people running them to respect us and our money, rather than totally destroy them all together. As much as I am against the abuse of military force I'd rather keep one, than not have one at all, or even worse and more likely, use privatized forces that have less oversight and less accountability. It's like that Churchill quote 'democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others' I think shit is fucked too, including government, I just don't agree with the logic of throwing out the baby with the bath water I guess 
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:26:57
Doesn't seem like it's somethin one could logically disagree with though. Many governments over the world have done plenty, definitely flawed depending on the level of corruption. But I mean the train system of Europe, the highway system of the US, our military all government. I would never argue that they're flawless, but I'd rather keep those things

Yeah that's true. Her campaign and the dnc fucked up big time in this election 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:04:34
Slight edge? 2.8 million votes you mean
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:02:45
We're fucked

I've had it take up to 10hrs but read other people saying more like 4/5
