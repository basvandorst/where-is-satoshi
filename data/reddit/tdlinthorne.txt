All this tells me is that Nasdaq is a better social company, employing more people in the community. Good work.

Except for the constant cost of maintaining the PoW network putting downwards pressure on prices...

That's a whole lot of extra electricity needed to make a Bitcoin...

Charge the military to protect you and give you the money?
Or tear up the roads and return them to pleasant feilds?
Or take the water from your house and pump it back to reservoirs, then demolish the reservoirs to restore the rivers and flood planes?
Or charge people for not having a job, which they then give that money to people with jobs?
I am not sure what you are getting at here...
I would add "lock up nominally innocent people and let criminals walk free" but the government seems to do that already, usually giving them high paying, "elected" jobs.

Only on an instantaneous timescale. On a monthly timescale 1btc = 2btc for the past month difference.

So how much do you really masterbate in your parents basement?

Whoever it is they have mined 3876BTC since the end of November last year.
As the outgoings are pretty bulk (looks manual to me) this could well be a single entity. The outgoings are also interesting, the majority is going into another wallet with no outgoings, accumulating 460odd bitcoins, a very small portion look like they are going to an exchange and sold off. Some other small transactions going to single wallet were it is the only transaction.
At a vague guess I would say a single mining farm entity with the owner paying himself dividends and the sold coin to cover costs. The other transactions no idea.

Ohhhh no I'm not falling for that again
