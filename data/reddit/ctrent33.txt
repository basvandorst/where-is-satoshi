Cool.  Cheap Bitcoin.  Roger and Jihan can have all the buggy coins they want.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:35:08
I wish I was mining. I'd do the same thing.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:03:35
Instead of a President they should have a King.  Ver, King of the bugs.

When BU forks, Bitcoin will be attacked, no doubt.  A POW change is needed.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:24:28
Bugs are not the solution, unless you want to destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:15:29
I'm worried about a 51% attack on core if Bu forks off.  And nobody wants BU, so it will just vanish.  Bye bye Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:21:19
You can thank BU supporters for that.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:43:32
Stay with the real Bitcoin, and if that goes away, invest in an altcoin permanently.  BU is garbage.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:31:20
Bitcoin satan is a better name for that guy.

Food and water.

The Bug king (Ver) would probably steal the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:27:47
BU = bug city.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:38:45
Why would anybody agree to that utter confusion?
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:48:11
Roger ver is the bug king, and yes, he wants to destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:48:26
I think they are.
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:23:17
Bitcoin would die if the POW wasn't changed in an attack situation.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:04:24
BU will never be Bitcoin, sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:54:23
Yes.  ETF is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:59:36
That depends on how much the wallstreet crooks want to manipulate it.  Bitcoin doesn't need wallstreet.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:31:30
You could give some to me.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:48:32
sounds like a scam.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:34:20
Bitcoin cash is an alt coin.  
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:54:28
Wow, those people are really dumb.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:53:42
Yeah, he is a nobody.  Who cares what he thinks.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:56:02
Fiat currencies are going down.  Why would you want to cash out into that?  Unless of course you need to.
@_date: 2017-06-01 18:36:21
"Everybody had their fingers crossed.."
I didn't.  An ETF would allow the banksters to manipulate the price like they do with gold and silver.  An ETF is bad news.
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:34:21
Wait.
