clever, but in the land of crypto why pay respect to the dollar?

Sorta zoomed in and wearing blinders to make assumptions like that about the entire technology. Certainly the interests of a corporate entity in a blockchain environment will be in favor of those ideas, but the value of the technology overall is dependent on its decentralization -- which becomes stronger via a larger and more diverse community.

I would highly recommend this article in understanding the differences

Sorry mate, that's just not the case. The Ledger Nano S ($50 model I assume you are describing) has an ST31H320 secure enclave which meets EAL6+ security standards (aka "bank grade" since that's one of the main uses). The Trezor has no such secure element in the device. This is a glaring problem to me especially if the hardware is lost or stolen, where it would be significantly easier to crack. If you'd care to read a breakdown of both devices you can find it here:

Further, Trezor does not actually contain a secure element due to it's open source nature. I'd suggest Ledger which uses real bank grade encryption (unlike Trezor)

It's a nice thought but easily proven false. Bitcoin, regardless of how small the amount, HAS been used to fund terrorism and despotic regimes. Ergo it HAS been used to facilitate war.
