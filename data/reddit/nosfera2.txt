I've been lately increasingly thinking of HODL's sister called SPEDN who will come of age as soon as Lightning Network is working and transaction fees are reasonable again. 
SPEDN: Spend Prudently Every Day Now (and buy back, of course).
SPEDNing even while you continue to HODL will drive adoption astronomically. It will encourage retailers and, together with a growing number people starting to ask for part of their wage in bitcoin soon, it will take us to the moon.

Just one thing. Don't fork Bitcoin. Fork Bitcoin Cash and, while you're at it, up the block size to 16MB so you can say your BCash scales better than Roger Ver's shitty Bitcoin Cash.

Oh, it really [depends](

The only void Mt. Gox has left behind is the lost bitcoins of its users.

Please read up on Counterparty. 
It is not "another altcoin", but an implementation of a trustless distributed exchange and peer-to-peer financial market. You don't even need to buy any XCP to use most of its features because you can do so directly in BTC. Also, the devs got no special treatment as regards XCP distribution.

Hmm. I never actually attributed Firefox slowness to AdBlock. If you're like me and have literally dozens of windows and tabs open in FF all the time, this addon called [bartab]( should help a great deal to free up memory and speed things up.
I had been holding back from upgrading to FireFox 4 which is supposedly much faster than 3.6 because bartab wasn't supported on it, but I just checked and I see it now is, so that's another speed boost coming.
So to sum up, I'd try FF 4 with bartab and adblock and see how it goes.

That's actually much harder in practice because it is difficult (impossible?) to distinguish between stolen bitcoins that have been laundered through other wallets and stolen bitcoins that have been unwittingly accepted by honest merchants. I hope I stand to be corrected, but it seems that you can easily pinpoint stolen bitcoins, but it's harder to catch the thief unless they make some stupid mistake.

I think they are referring to a share, which is a very small proof of work unit. It's equivalent to solving the bitcoin mining problem with difficulty 1.

Indeed, but right now it's not trivial for the average user to know that coins are stolen, or for anyone to prove that money has been intentionally laundered. I suppose these features might be able to be built into the system somehow, but at the moment they don't exist.
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:04:18
It would be if it stuck.
@_date: 2011-06-17 09:29:15
How will you feel if in some years time you find you could have bought a house with those grocery bitcoins?
Haha! Just kidding!
@_date: 2011-06-30 16:21:42
Then go with Adblock. I don't see why you should have any trouble.

For phoenix, as I understand it, you need to edit guiminer\kernels\phatk\kernel.cl
Having said that, the improvement I got was [less than 1MH/s]( so let me know how it works for you.

My husband left the door to our apartment unlocked and we got burgled, and he didn't have the courage to admit his miatake so he blamed his friend for losing the keys.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:18:04
Go to Compute4Cash.com and download their client.
Just kidding. Do some folding and cure cancer over the weekend.
@_date: 2011-06-17 09:32:38
Some friend! And he must be kicking himself now!
@_date: 2011-06-27 10:07:24
Thanks. AGGRESSION=12 actually dropped my rate a couple of MH/s, so you might have something to gain there. I'm on Win 7 atm.
I'm still curious why my mileage did vary so much, though :)
@_date: 2011-06-26 10:04:47
No, I'm saying Mt Gox were lax with their security, got hacked, and then blamed their 'auditor'.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:36:47
What happens in the real world when the authorities catch a thief? Do they go about everywhere the thief has spent money asking for it back? 
If there are eventually warnings about suspect funds, then fine, but otherwise it would probably undermine merchants' confidence in the system if they are at risk of being asked or pressured to return BTC payments because the coins were stolen.
Also, BTC laundering is unlikely to involve third-parties because anyone can create as many wallets as they like, unlike bank accounts.
@_date: 2011-06-30 14:22:13
Yeah! Facefucks!
@_date: 2011-06-27 09:31:06
That pretty much sums up the definition of fap-worthy. I say give it a shot!
@_date: 2011-06-27 07:36:38
Seriously. [That's what they said](

What ads? Oh, you don't use adblock?
@_date: 2011-06-27 07:31:52
What are your settings on the 5870? 
Mine is also clocked to 900/300 and I always got 397.7MH/s. This change barely took it up to 398.2MH/s, which is obviously less than expected. I'm using AGGRESSION=14 and WORKSIZE=256.
@_date: 2011-06-17 10:01:06
Will using the windows keyboard thwart a keylogger? Could be a good option for the super-paranoid, I guess.
@_date: 2011-06-27 20:30:02
5850 or 5870? If it's the first, then wow! And I was already at 397 before the edit and only got to 398 with the change, so you got much more of a boost than I did.
