But just because we can now spend them at a growing number of retailers doesn't mean there's any reason to.  For an american with a bank account, I could already buy stuff online at Dell, or Overstock, etc etc.  That they now accept bitcoin doesn't solve any problem I had.  
It's not cheaper for me (just the retailer) to pay with bitcoin, and it's not easier than paypal or visa.
I'm a big believer in the power of bitcoin once there's a network effect, just not seeing any reason yet why I would recommend using it to my parents, say.

Ok, but how many consumers are paid in bitcoin?  Maybe a few hundred, who all work for bitcoin-related companies?

Only against their "online storage", ie their hot wallet, ie only about 3% of their BTC

The problem now is consumer adoption.  Retailer adoption is growing, and there's good reasons for companies to add bitpay or coinbase as a checkout option, but to turn this tweet around, **If you're a consumer, there's really no reason to use Bitcoin at this point.**

Since you don't have the seed, it's more of a hardware problem now, so you'll probably get more help elsewhere.

Regardless of their intentions, a for-profit corporation is not necessarily the best type of entity to be in control of something like Bitcoin.

You shouldn't really do this in such a manual way, with no safeguards for incorrect user inputs.

Your advice is far far riskier for nearly everyone.

Try covering the rails with your hands until you see him moving forward, then you can remove your hands.

You're saying that selling 100 btc, of the more than 12,000,000 that have been mined, will move the market 20-30%
