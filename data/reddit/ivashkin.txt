Months, maybe years.

Very true. This is why I'm very sure that blockchain currencies will be a part of the future but not convinced that any of the coins we're using today will be.

Market hasn't settled yet, some are going with BCASH, some with Litecoin, some looking at XMR. I think most want to stick with things which are similar to bitcoin because some of them are hard to implement and the people with the skills to do it could make a lot more money working for less risky employers. Bcash is likely to be the one that goes somewhere given that it was bitcoin until a few months ago.

Too many people who view crypto as an asset that has value in USD and not enough view it as a currency they can trade with. And also a large amount of people who hold BTC seem to think that for reasons yet to be explained it will continue to increase in value at the same pace during 2018 despite the fact that large amounts of people holding small amounts of BTC (especially in wallets that aren't on an exchange) can't spend their coins nor can they trade them without substantial fees. So I'm going to follow what the drug dealers and criminals use tbh, because these are people who do have a need for a reliable decentralized currency to trade goods and services with.

Drug dealers tend to have better coffee.

I've heard a few markets were looking at LTC, it's perfect for the transactions people want to do there it plus you can convert to and from fiat fairly easily compared to some of the more unique coins.

So can you move BTC from a non-segwit wallet to a segwit wallet without paying fees?

That's the key, it's been proven that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can work, so even if the implementations we have now aren't fantastic someone will eventually solve all the problems we face.

Indeed, and when that market goes elsewhere it will fundamentally change things.

Half of mine were $30 payouts from nicehash lol

It forked from btc, meaning that the tools and services DNM's have to implement are a variation on a technology they already understand. Where as implementing Monero is a substantial change. All these markets care about is the exchange of goods and services for a token which transfers value from the buyer to the seller as quickly and smoothly as possible, so path of least resistance wins.

This is the thing, I am not trying to make money with crypto. I want to use it for trade as I've been doing for years already, but the higher the price of BTC goes the less it's actually worth to me.

That's the reason I'm looking to get out of bitcoin, the transaction fees mean that the people who actually use bitcoin as a currency to trade low value goods can't use it for anything, leaving the entire project just "storing value" for the very wealthy.

Do you remember the first early planes, the ones that had propellers in weird places, 7 sets of wings and the pilots chair was a re-purposed wing-back from the local bar? That's where crypto currencies are today. Most of it is garbage, but a handful aren't and sooner or later the idea of a decentralized currency people can use to exchange value across borders without government controls is going to take off.

I have £1.25 in coinbase. Do I need to care?

Typically when it goes south you see the transaction as pending, it's quite common with fluctuations to see coinbase unable to trade.
