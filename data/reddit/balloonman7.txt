SCHIFF is a liar like 99% of the rest of his wall street goons. Go to schiff gold.com which is his gold buying website. Anyways one of the payments you can make to buy gold is BTC. Yea that's right hell take your bitcoin if you buy gold on his website. Dont take my word for it look up yourself. SCHIFF is not for the people like he claims to be ...

Eh idk man I believe secretly he's buying bitcoin . I could be wrong tho. Take kevin o'Leary for example . In 2013 he was supporting bitcoin and excited about it. Now this year on cnbc he acts clue less about it and says its trash. They lie to us while they buy a ton of btc behind most people back.
