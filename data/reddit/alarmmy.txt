A normal person can't use their own fund, but it is perfectly fine for the real terrorists and drig dealers to live in the penthouses across America.

Stupid people want all for themselves without thinking for society.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:39:13
Yes, that is what I am doing. I work knowing that  some of my money is contributed back to society, and I will be taken care when I am retired. My money is paying for those who are retiring, and when I am retiring, the younger generation is paying for me. It is the circle of life. Believe me, we live in a much better place than most of the world.  Maybe people can just stop whining for a second and appreciate what they have.

Nope, just wait for it to drop to $3000 - $5000 again and buy it straight up without taking a loan.

Do you still have those shares? I am just curious.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:41:35
I still don't get it. How do they tax Bitcoin? It is virtual money, and it is not tracked or monitored by Social security number.

Do you even read what you wrote? If dollar is worthless, then why you have to exchange bitcoin for dollar? Good luck buying anything with your bitcoin.

Would you please advise how do I create my own bitcoin wallet?

Gold has economic value as components for electrical devices and as jewelry.

Cramer is nothing than a scammer. He talked shit about some stocks to make people panic and sell. Then he made profits from it.

Is there a way to transfer my bitcoin from coinbase to my own wallet? I don't see any transfer option in Coinbase app.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:04:05
What is seed? Sorry I am new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:46:40
How do I disclose it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:24:50
How do you put it in a hard drive. Would you please guide me or direct me to the articles about it. I am new and still research about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:58:14
Thank you. We never know what will happen next. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:34:31
Do you know the fee to transfer from coinbase to wallet?

No one can predict the future. For investment, it is a 50-50 chance for both ways. Nothing will go up forever. I believe BTC will have more chance to go down a little more before going up higher than this.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:04:04
I believe Bitcoin is here to stay, but this kind of post is just misleading. Stock market is not crashing, it was at all time high, and people are cashing out. Same as Bitcoin was all time high at $20,000 and now drop to $6,000.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:45:25
I hope you did not buy it at $20,000. 
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:53:01
Make no sense. Is bitcoin going to stop recession? Buy low, sell high. That's  all.
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:59:03
Do not do that. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:12:47
Only invest what you can afford to lose. And nothing go to zero, except if you invest all you have in shitty companies. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:05:59
It is so ironic that they say Bitcoin is the future currency, but they still cash out for dollars. Think about that before you put your hard earned money in crypto. 
Blockchain technology is here to stay. But don't think buying Bitcoin will make you rich. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:11:53
Digital Asset will be worth nothing in time of crysis because it produces nothing. 
BTC retards keep saying investing in BTC to get more yield, and then cashing out BTC for dollars, which they always hate. If they want BTC to be a currency, it cannot be an investment because currency needs to circulate. BTC is not gold, land, companies, or stocks, and BTC retards keep talking about it as investment. They are just contradict themselves. 
Blockchain technology is here to stay, but the BTC retards will be gone with their moon dream. And yet, they still have to cash out BTC for dollars. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:17:31
What is the point of this reminder? Does Bitcoin make this debt go away? Or can we pay this debt with Bitcoin?

The true is it lost 70% value in about a year.

4% raise of your salary and 5% increase of your expense are not the same thing. It does not mean 4% is less than 5%.

Thanks to Communism.
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:43:58
You are totally missing the point. Why keeps talking about BTC as an investment to yield dollars while want it to be a replacement for dollars? You cannnot even make any explanation on that. 
Stock trading is based on the value of the company and the goods/money/future it produces. BTC is not a stock, but people keep comparing it with stock market, and BTC retards keep bashing the stock market, while treating BTC like a stock. To me it is super comical. 
Where did I talk about price movement? It is this post talking about the price. And many posts in this sub is talking about moon and hodl. Moon to what? Moon to dollars to get rich? And hodl to what if you want it to be a currency? Do you see that funny circle? If those BTC retards want BTC and blockchain to be the future, stop talking about moon/investment/stock market to compare with BTC. 
The retards talk about decentralization, and they hoard BTC like mad men, and whales. So much for decentralization. 
For digital assets exchanges, of course when there is the opportunities to make money, there will be the businessmen. At the end of the day, they are the ones make money from BTC. 
FYI, all electronic devices you use for your BTC, there is gold in it.

 If fiat currency is extinguished, there will be NO "how much" to compare. There will be no price.
Bitcoin and blockchain are here to stay, but fiat currency will not vanish any time soon.
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:10:13
No, I am not convincing you to not doing what is right.
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:53:38
I have boufht bitcoin, but never sell. Do I need to report to IRS?
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:49:30
Considering the price dropped more than 50% from the last peak, they were not entirely wrong.
We will never know the bottom or the top.
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:32:28
Keep dreaming. Comparing Bitcoin and Gold is actually stupid.

I just did. I have 9875 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:08:22
I have 1000 BTC. Seriously, it does not make any differences. There is no proof about what I am saying. In fact, I have 9875 Bitcoin, not 1000.
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:53:26
I do not think minimum wage 7.25 is a good measurement here. Many companies pay minimum $10 to $12/hr. If someone works a job that pays $7.25/hr, they seriously need to change their career or go back to college instead of talking about car.
One more thing, why buy an average car while earning minimum wage? Cheapest new car out there is about $10000 to $12000, that what you should buy with minimum wage, not a $25000 car.
