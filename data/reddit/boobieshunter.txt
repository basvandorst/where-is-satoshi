I'll be happy if I get to 21BTC.  With 21, there can never be more than 1 million people with more bitcoin than me.

Coinbase is a measly 1.5% and they already have your info.  Another option is gemini.com but I don't know what their fees are.

Can you explain the payment part more?  Do you have a transaction we can look up on the blockchain?

If your activity looks like you are using a personal banking account for a business, they will shut it down without explanation.

If you're trying to buy bitcoin from coinbase to use for gambling, you are going to have a bad time.

Who cares if it is frowned upon.  Don't let that hold you back if you have a good idea.  
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:39:25
I see.  How did you send it?  What wallet did you use?  
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:24:38
I already know.  There is no precedent, they are talking out of their ass.  There is already a working cryptocoin that I can't mention here(because it is banned on this sub) that achieves fungibility.  is living proof that is full of shit.

Your english is really bad, it's hard to understand what you are saying.
