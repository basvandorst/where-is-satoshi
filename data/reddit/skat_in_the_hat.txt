What if, im already paying, things are already rolling, but due to shitty spending, and poor decision making, you put our country in debt?   
Then a new currency rolls in, and now im expected to pay more because you cant even properly manage the money we already pay in tax? Come on, that is absolutely state sponsored theft. Maybe dont build 3 of the latest F Raptors? Maybe build 1, and let the branches share it? Maybe dont require that contractors spend the entire budget, or risk getting less the next year? Maybe dont wiretap every god damn person on the fucking planet, and try to store it somewhere for an infinite amount of time?

The American way, and why we refuse to give up our second amendment. Without it, we have no other rights.

What it lacks is accountability. Patent validity should be able to be called into question without taking a million years. Patent trolls should be somehow disrupted. It stifles progress. Look at the SCO unix fiasco. They sued everyone they could.

Loosely word it enough to patent troll crypto out of existence.  
 
The patent office is a bunch of 3rd graders with rubber stamp

Assuming you meant not...That's not how liquid cooling works. 3m makes a non conductive fluid you can submerge your electronics in. A guy I know was trying to get me to put my gpu's in it to give them stats.  
  
The liquid increases the surface area, which pulls the heat away from the cards. The fluid has a really low boiling point which causes the fluid to exchange the heat with the air, with way more surface area than the GPU would have with a fan blowing over it.

I'm sure all they had to do was switch to the next card

I sure hope so. Fuck identity theft.

Major companies can't stop losing our ss# you think it's a good idea to give an exchange a copy of our dox too?

Oooh that would be so nice. To just find out you had an extra 75 bch to sell.
