First of all, please look up how to use ‚literally‘ because it makes you look stupid. 
Second, my logic isnt cryptos are bad because they can be used for criminal activity. My argument is that people saying crypto is going to abolish banks and government are dilusional. Dilusional because just like it already does for criminal dark web activity, crypto will ultimately also benefit governments and banks. Because a technology per se will never bring societal change, societal change can only come from society.

Bitcoin CAN NOT technically be the platform for 99.9% of traffic thats not on it yet. Please understand this. First blockchain out there and the big name that made it popular but technically not there yet. Other coins are much more there yet, but bitcoin is not and will not. Think transaction costs of 30$ for a 5$ transaction. NOT. FEASIBLE.

CryptoCoins will just enable the existing system to load off some legacy burocracy and come out leaner and more powerful, at least the ones who bring good products out to the market first. 
Everyone who thinks cryptos will magically make corrupt banks disappear has no clue how technological revolutions work. Fools with tools are just fools, and 99% of people who vote, consume, use traditional banks will not magically switch to new non bank non governmental systems. 
And to everyone thinking cryptos mainly are helping poor citizens oppressed by capitalism just think about WHO actually is profiting from all these gains the most. Just keep in mind that all these dark web weapons child porn drug dealers paid in cryptos are probably all rich as fuck now.
