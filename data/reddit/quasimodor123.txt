If Blockstream had implemented the 2MB block size increase as was promised per the HK agreement prior to developing SegWit, then yeah, probably. But as of right now, probably not. Too many miners (not just Antpool, not just Bitmain, not just the Chinese - many Europeans hate Blockstream as well) have become distrusting of Blockstream and do not even consider the technical aspects of the discussion anymore. The majority of miners simply do not want to cooperate with the Core devs anymore.

Keep in mind that r/bitcoin is neither the bitcoin community, nor is it representative of it. When you say "we" you are talking about a very small number of people that just talk a big game because they are not used to being contradicted in their echochamber (that's what BitFury meant in their statement when they said that the cens*rship needed to stop). "You" do not have a lot of money (Great job editing that part out of your initial post, glad you realized that was bullshit), not when compared to the other 98%+ of the bitcoin community. And whales, companies, exchanges and miners will not sacrifice their own interests for any misguided political agenda. Miners will follow the majority chain, as will economic players. Nobody is going to bleed for your cause. This is not a movie.

You need to pay more attention to what's actually going on, and what factors are actually relevant right now.

As far as I know, no Core developer has even dared to speak in favor of something like a change of PoW, because it is a ludicrous idea. So how is it that you think you know better than them, or Satoshi as a matter of fact, what is the best way to proceed? Please enlighten me. With concrete ideas this time, not some Trump-esque jibber jabber about *how it has to be done* without offering any thought out plan.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:43:14
When it comes to proposals by Blockstream, yes, to a certaint extent it has. That doesn't exclude the developers as individuals though. Core contributors are very talented and valuable to the further development of Bitcoin - but Blockstream as a company is most likely not going to play as big a part as it did in the past. The developers will move on, just as the original developers did, and might eventually come back to contribute with different leadership / under a different company.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:10:53
That's what I thought. All political BS with no technical insights as to how it could actually be done. Pro tip: If Core knew, they'd already suggested it - and these people are a lot smarter than you and I. Do you even know what Proof of Work means?
So no, Satoshi did not fail in that regard. He successfully tackled the The Byzantine Generals Problem with his solution, and it has worked since 2009. Please google it, and then read the whitepaper. You would profit from it as an individual so much more than arguing over something you do not understand.

I don't know if you are aware of this, but the other sub thinks the same about you. Furthermore, 95%+ of bitcoin users do not even visit reddit - so do not assume that hate for blockstream doesn't exist because you only take into consideration what is being said in this echochamber. It is everything but representative of the bitcoin community as a whole. And the recent changes in proposal support prove that.

Next to nobody was even aware of Jihan's tweets outside of r/bitcoin, while all of the signing exchanges publicly announced that a hardfork might be imminent. And you really believe that Jihan is to blame for this? Get real. Even neutral subs like bitcoinmarkets talked about the crash, and they also knew that it was because of hardfork fears. Yet nobody mentioned Jihan's tweets there, or on any other bitcoin related subs, or even bitcointalk. Jihan might be a questionable man, but he did not cause the recent crash. That's all Blockstream's doing.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:46:06
Exchanges said they will list whichever chain ends up winning as Bitcoin. Period. Core has no inherent privilege to the bitcoin name what so ever. If the BU hardfork occurs with a hashrate above 70% then I guarantee that the minority chain will not survive, and BU will retain the Bitcoin name, as was intended by Satoshi. PoW is not going to be changed by Core, and it cannot be changed without hardforking either. And the often quoted economic majority is an illusion.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:51:42
I highly doubt Core would dare to touch that. It is (1) only possible through a hardfork, (2) a major vulnerability issue and (3) a fundamental contradiction to Satoshi's whitepaper.

"Blockstream is a blockchain technology company co-founded by Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Austin Hill and others, and led by Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell. **Blockstream provides funding for the development of Bitcoin Core**, the predominant network client software."
Come again?

He already got it back. That story never got a lot of traction in this sub for rather obvious reasons.

Changing the PoW is a possibility, but an endeavor like this is literally the definition of creating an altcoin. It goes against the fundamentals bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:33:17
Obviously?! Hard forks are the natural evolution of bitcoin - have you even read the fucking whitepaper???
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:46:19
This happened a couple of days ago. The block was mined by Bitmain/Antpool - and they have given the money back to the individual that made the mistake. But that story didn't get a lot of traction in this sub because Jihan Wu is a despicable human being, *amirite?*

@_date: 2017-03-19 07:50:12
Miners aren't betraying anybody. You should read Satoshi's whitepaper and then google "The Byzantine Generals Problem" - there are reasons why PoW has been established the way it is since 2009. It works.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:58:33
Market crash was due to exchanges releasing a statement that made it seem like a hardfork was imminent to bystanders. Jihan was not responsible for this.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:30:08
That's true. The BU team is waiting for numbers higher than 70%.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:39:05
The misconception that Jihan Wu and Bitmain control all of the hashrate currently signalling for BU is something you need to get over. Yes, Bitmain has a lot of hashing power, but there are several other actors at play, among those are also a vast number of individual miners that share his opinion.

Should BitFury really flip-flop and switch sides, then SegWit is virtually dead. Seems like we are about to reach a conclusion in the scaling debate quicker than I had anticipated. Finally, at least we're moving forward now.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:43:44
Here's the data on proof of work: 
43.1% of blocks mined today supported BU vs 22.9% supporting SegWit. We're getting closer and closer to the 51% - 75% margin. And keep in mind that it is to be expected that the 8MB block supporters will eventually signal for BU (which would mean another 7-8% on top). This movement might also encourage non-voters to finally get on board so we can finally resolve the scaling debate.
Edit: 43.8% vs 19.4% by now
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:53:51
You do not seem to understand: The chain that's left with 30% hashpower cannot survive. (Read up on difficulty adjustment and 51% attacks). That's what I meant when I said that the "winning" chain will retain the Bitcoin name. The minority chain will die. You should read the posts of the Shapeshift and Coinbase CEOs. They have recently stopped by.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:56:21
Because I disagree with a very small community that isn't representative of the bitcoin world? Because I believe economic players are interested in profits and not political agendas? Because I have brought forward facts backing up that miners are favoring BU?
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:42:06
I don't know what has been discussed in those meetings, but as I've said, if BitFury flip flops then SegWit loses its biggest supporter, which would probably lead to the activation of BU in the foreseeable future. That should alleviate the transaction fee issues for now. BU will then probably continue to work on their own off-chain scaling (FlexTrans) and introduce it when they're ready. But these are just speculations. I'm glad something's finally happening though.
