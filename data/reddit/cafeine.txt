Hey! Is that the new $5 Raspberry Pi?

All of this is probably just a bubble, but because of bitcointip and my (small) karma, I'm now 0.001 BTC richer than 5 minutes ago.
I'm not sure if I'm going to "invest" any amounts of my savings into bitcoins but I'm more than willing to use my spare time to work for someone wanting to pay me in bitcoins.
I guess we have to go for the long run. Any small current amount of BTC will be worth a lot more if BTC ever becomes what we all hope for.
And if it collapses... No big deal, I'll loose these 0,17€ I just won and I'd had a great time thinking about all of this.

You're probably two very honnest gentlemen. But I would like to remind people that due to the very nature of bitcoin and the fact that we're all people on the internet, there is a risk in doing this.
Everybody should really understand the risk and accept it before playing on a bitcoin website.
Anyway thank's for providing "things" around bitcoins. We need more people doing this.

I too think this is the key when dealing with bitcoins. Also, thanks for the gold, it'll be put to good use ;)
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:25:34
Well I could be wrong, I've done the math with 3%, too. That's 30000 a year and 2500 a month. 2500€ is a decent salary here in France.
Sure you have to take into account taxes and inflation, and also age and way of life. The minimum amount may be more like 10 millions. But you can always go to a poorer country and live very confortably with 1 million.

You should also know that those faucets just aren't worth the time. It's dust and two days of dust is still dust.
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:15:23
I agree !
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:03:14
Thanks for answering. I understand the issue you were facing and the proposed solution seems good to me !
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:58:25
I think what this story tells us is that if you want to trade bitcoins, you have to do it in a foolproof way for you, even if that means less business.
Some guys was talking about going to his bank with the buyer and ask people there to check the bills.
Any other ideas ?

Your comment is 3 hours old as I write this and... you were right ?
* mtgox	 2.00	2 hours ago	 124.90 
* mtgox	 0.20	3 hours ago	 124.00 
* mtgox	 0.11	3 hours ago	 124.80

* mtgox	 0.01	3 hours ago	 124.00
Setting the price at 124.90 whereas it was only 123 when trades where frozen 8 hours ago.

In 6 months the laptop WILL be worth less. Why not wait 6 more months, or 2 years, or 10 ? It's the same thing with BTC, except you're not sure if they will be worth more or less in a few months.
In other words, why should you use them ? Because they may have less or no value in the future. We just don't know. What you are sure is what they are worth right now. It's a risk to wait, and you'll have to choose to spend or to hold by yourself because nobody can know.

Ow right sometimes I forgot that phones can be used this way. Did you try a quick google search ? Here are my results so far : 
The third one is not up yet, and the first one cost you money, you may want to use the second one (but your telephone provider may charge you sometging, too...)
Don't forget to compare the price they send to the real price on the exchanges as much as you can. You can't be sure they have the real number.

Thanks, but your post will probably get buried because there are really a lot of people interesting into telling the others what to do.
At least you get my upvote.

0 BTC ! But I redeemed 0,001 BTC with the bot and that's now 0,16€... 
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:59:17
By the look of it... I'd say a lot of the sites are related.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:18:38
Don't try to take advantage of what is happening. There are smarter, more connected people out there and you can't win against those people.
1. Decide for yourself how many you're willing to risk.
2. If you hesitate on the amount, take a lower amount, repeat until you're sure you don't give a fuck about said amount.
3. Buy bitcoins when you feel like the price is fair (taking into account price evolution since a few months, not just 4 weeks).
4. CONSIDER THE MONEY LOST FOREVER.
5. Never, ever, sell your BTC for less than you bought them.
If the price crash, then you don't give a fuck because 2). If the price goes up, cash your initial investment if you're in need, or just wait and hold cause there is a chance you'll be millionaire one day. And if it's just a bubble, well, 2). again.
Also, having BTC comes with a lot of risks, you should take time to learn how about having a (relatively) safe wallet.
I personally think that anyone buying BTC now is a fool. There's too much volatility and risk. Just wait for all that mess to cool off. But's its personal, and I don't own BTC so I may have interest in the price going low.
Anyway, I hope that, like me, you had a great time watching all this knowing that you own no BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:55
If you don't have bitcoins just profit. Look at all the chaos happening as it rises then falls then rises again. That's way more entertainment than what a few mBTC could get me !

So why in hell is this button displayed when doing a local transaction ? You can't just put a button in the middle of the page and expect people not to click it. Even with big red warnings.
Can't you just delete that damn button for local transactions ? 
I was going to use it a few days ago. The reasoning behind this is "this is a buyer protection and I'm an honest seller, so there is no reason not to accept it". The only reason I've not clicked it is because I saw the warning, but many people would just click it nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:41:50
A lot more then ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:32:04
This. People who have made a lot of money recently played with coins for shits and giggles two years ago. They do not care about the investment, they just wanted to try this new thing they heard about, do some transaction from wallet to wallet, play satoshidice.
The price could have plummet under $0,01, they would'nt care. It was all shits and giggles. You shouldn't be investing money or savings into bitcoin at the moment, the price is changing too quickly.
My sympathy to OP, I hope the best for you and I'm sure you'll get over all this.
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:25:05


If you try to "make it back", you'll end up losing it all. You should consider never touching it again starting now.

Wow thanks for the insight, internet stranger. I'm now in the process of investing all of my savings and taking a big loan so I can hop in and rule the world.
Give me your address and I promise I'll tip you 33% of all my gains !
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:17:54
Saw it a few minutes ago ! BTC down to $215 now, that's what I call volatility. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 18:30:07
Thanks for the way you handle marketing. Yesterday I gambled (and lost aha) one euro in bitcoins on your website. It's really great fun.
Too bad we can't have the free satoshi each day this summer :P
@_date: 2013-07-06 18:45:13
Thanks !
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:08:45
With so many people waiting for a lower price before joining the bandwagon, I doubt it'll head back to $5 anytime soon...

It takes a long time because a lot of people want to buy bitcoins (or be able to do so in the future).


Because of the nature of bitcoins, there is no other way to do a "secure" exchange at the moment.


Find an online exchange that operates in your country and under your country's laws. At least if something goes wrong you may be able to seek help.


People are running crazy because of bitcoins and they do a lot of things in haste. Just wait for it to cool down.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:21:26
Because MtGox closed its market a few hours ago, $123 is the price of the last exchange that happened on MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:43:57
I know that feel bro.
I had a few BTC years ago, just to play with. Yesterday I was unscrewing/screwing all my past hard drives to search for a bitcoin installation and a wallet.dat !
I must have format the "holly" drive a few months after... That's how life goes :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:48:30
You won't be able to have information on the price if your phone does not have access to internet.

Sent fiat to an exchange yesterday and the price is recovering today...
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:11:34
I'm not a native speaker and I'm very interested in what you just said. I was not trying to make a comparison (eg: a lot more than...) but to assert something (eg: so, you mean a lot more ?"). Was it wrong to use "then" in this case ? Maybe with a comma it's better (eg: a lot more, then ?) ?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:40:30


Well it did in 2011 and again this month. We just cannot be sure it'll not happen again in the future. We may think that, because of this bubble, an other one is less likely to happen, but... there are so many weak people out there...
@_date: 2013-06-01 17:02:02
Got them, now it's time to spin :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:28:10
I'm talking about a fictionnal scenario where no bubble happened and the price plummeted instead. They would not have cared about it.
I'm not saying hold your BTC forever. I'm saying that you shouldn't gamble more than what you can afford to loose.
If you were a BTC millionaire, you should have cashed it very quickly. $1,000,000 now is an infinite times more valuable than $100,000,000 tomorrow **maybe**. With so much money you can live only from interests. Especially if you acquired those BTC when they were near free.
And yes, I wouldn't probably be a millionaire because I would have cashed it at wayyy before $100...
@_date: 2013-08-18 17:59:57
You just got trolled by a troller on a topic about a guy trolling other guys. *Props*.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:25:27
It's not possible. People will charge back the money and there is no way to get the BTC back. It'll not happen.
@_date: 2013-06-07 10:54:54
I read on a french newspaper that they do need some sort of warrant to spy on you... unless you're not a USA citizen.

You're wrong and right at the same time. Yes, $800 is damn absurd if you consider the value of a coin to be linked to how useful it is. And I think, like you, that THIS should be the true value of a coin.
But right now, the value is not that. It's what people think the coin will be worth in a few weeks or months. And that's where I was also wrong a few months ago when I said that there was no reason for a coin that was worth $50 one day to be worth $100 the next morning.
Given that is has been $500 a coin a few days ago, you'll ALWAYS find people willing to buy some for $500/$600. And so on. That's why the price is rising constantly even if the true value is less.
Now if you think this way, there are two outcomes : either there is enough funds and people to keep the price rising, or the price will begin to drop and all the people who bought at $200+ only because they thought it was easy money will dump theirs as the price sunk. This will be a hard day/week for whoever thought "bitcoin to the moon" but it will not impact Bitcoin so much.
I hope I'm wrong again and that when someone will read this message again in 10 years I'll be rich as fuck.

So the "one giveaway per IP address" limit is per day ? If so, that's an excellent news :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:15:32
What part exactly is making you laugh ? Price's down to $120 per BTC now, and frequent (smaller) rebounds. High variation of price in a short time = high volatility...
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:27:18

Let it be a reminder for all of us. Just set up 2 factor authentication or store your coins on a securely generated paper wallet.
I feel bad for you, OP.

MtGox trades are frozzen since a few hours. $123 is the price of the last trade that happened there.
