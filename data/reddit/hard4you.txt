People having to jump through hoops to be able to use a currency is what drives many average people away from bitcoins.

Is this the idiot who tried making an explosive delivery shop where he sent high end explosives through the US mail service? If it is this man is an idiot who looks for attention.

So far people have found only a fifth of their coins lost. It is big and I would be surprised if they can pay everyone back without falling into insolvency.

They have to make sure your deposit source is not from a stolen credit card or bank account. They can not allow a larger balance to be moveable for a week until they confirm from your depositor that it was you who wanted to put the money in.

This is the start of the many legal sounding responses we can expect until they finally announce they are bankrupt.

Great now it is under $260. Thanks for hyping it again...
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:08:13
Yet you do not put all of it into bits.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:06:14
Still under $270 or me. Not sure where you are getting over $300.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:30:37
They are not really telling us if only 18,500 coins were stolen.

I see the price dropping 5% once the market reopens through them. They lost ~20% of their coins so it is not as bad as Gox losing ~100%.

Can you prove you have the funds to payout big wins? If I put in 10btc and win back 25btc will it be payable? How quickly can it be done.
I need to know as many of these "betting" sites were started and they were simple ponzi schemes that ended once someone won big and they could not payout.

Also this is interesting news.

I really doubt he still has them. He must have passed the bag onto another person once they hit $550. Remember folks, stops should be set up when using the market.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:44:38
That is to be seen. A loss of 20% of your coins is quite a big hit to replace easily. We will see in few days whether they are solvent or not.

This is assuming they have spent nothing to pay their employees or running a business.

Large banks and credit agencies have a lot of transactions to go through every day. There is a backlog of sorts and since you are not moving around tens of thousands of dollars or more your money is less of a concern to expedite the process of approval by both Circle and your depositor.

Hurry up and put your money where your mouth is! This is the next bubble you do not want to miss.

To answer your question OP, people do not trust the American system. While it is safer many people do not wish to have their identity associated with bitcoins within the US as the legality fluctuates quite a bit. Recently we have some states opening their borders to using bitcoins but it is not happening fast enough to feel safe using US exchanges, they could be banned overnight.

Where is the remind me bot to remind me?
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:33:47
The fear of stamp having another hack or loss of bitcoins is much higher now that it has happened once. Their security has been shown to be weak and thus untrustable. Similar to a bank that can have its vault robbed, no one wants to trust a weak vault when there are others with better records of safety. In short many people will leave them for another trading firm and the price will fluctuate down about 5% before coming back up to ~$280.

It will take some time. Currently they have a large amounts of withdrawals occurring.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:10:14
And those small changes lead to a hell of a drop.
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:42:18
Large volume owners are selling and rebuying at lower prices to sell on small upticks. This is an ongoing cycle but it seems more of them have started doing this as of 12 hours ago. They are crashing our market!

The guy believed he hired successful murders on six groups of people, some of which involved wife and kids. He paid into the hundreds of thousands to make murders happen. There is no second chance when you place six hits out.
