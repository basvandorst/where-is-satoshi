No he’s not
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:10:03
Yeah this, however accumulating over time to hit something such as 2k which is realistic can still prove very worth it but the tech should be the main point it’s amazing

This ain’t a get rich quick scheme lol especially with 500 measly dollars. You ain’t gonna see good returns on shit with that amount. Grow up
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:25:41
This ain’t some get rich quick scheme kid  . Especially with 500. With that little money you’d be hard to see good returns on anything , go spend it and leave us alone

How will they know you have bitcoin . Fifty cent did exactly this if I remember correct
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:20:17
YIKESSS fuckoff ya tit
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:47:17
TERRIBLE IDEA
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:34:21
Not anymore unless u have ALOT to already invest in btc. This ain’t like it was where u could easily buy 30 btc
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:58:06
Not hard to find though. Also showing balance is ridiculous . What’s the benefits of a public blockchain
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:46:39
Hope not im my done buying yet lol
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:56:31
No one use this. If it ain’t a scam it’s pure pointless shit. If someone wanted to mix they need to switch to monero and back. Tumblers are ineffective
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:18:13
And then you wake up... lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:36:32
Disagree , a lot of millennials don’t have the kind of money to put in bitcoin to make the life changing money. Most aren’t going to hold a full btc, unless btc goes to a million it ain’t going to make them wealthy holding -1 btc
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:25:46
Don’t get taken for a mug. No
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:59:10
I would quite like a low 6 atm
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:53:25
Day trading is extremely hard and majority lose money doing so . Best to hodl imo
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:07:27
Pray to the btc gods for a dip to buy more lower
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:56:11
Good old 4chan /biz lol
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:12:45
Same can be said for houses. Or grandparent bought them dirt cheap and now , Fiat is the same as what u described right now
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:26:35
Don’t waste your time on him mate
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:22:20
I personally HATE how transactions are public and trackable by anyone
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:38:47
Real satoshi ain’t falling for this week bait
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:19:15
Imagine falling for this 0 iq scam
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:41:38
Or buy your coke with btc 100iq move
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:06:23
