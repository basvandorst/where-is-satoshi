That reddit no longer exists. It hasn't since the Digg exodus. It hasn't since user generated subs began. 
It still works, in some subs. And r/all? Who goes to the front page? I haven't been there for years.

Hard to take the article seriously? My word count script counted nearly 15,000 words. If nothing else it's a substantial piece of work. If the final sentence is true, the author is a securities attorney but I haven't bothered to verify that. But it raises the question, what are your credentials? Don't mean to sound snarky here, but...
Just because he committed one or two fallacies does not render the article useless. I should note that I don't recall seeing a single typo, gotta give credit for that especially considering the length. 
IMO, it's the most thorough article I've ever read regarding cryptocoinology. I don't recall reading anything on reddit that comes close to the author's obviously extensive research.  Sure, it's not a technical exposé, I don't think it ever pretended to be. It's about human nature, economics, and American business culture. 
Perhaps the biggest flaw was the title, "Race to Replace Bitcoin." I don't see where the author ever took that tone after the title. Maybe it should have been called "The Days of Our Lives of CryptoCoin's Biggest Players" because it read like a soap opera to me. I was thinking it should be made into a movie similar to "The Social Network."
I give it 2 thumbs up.

I don't see how this is score settling by the author if that's what you meant. The author is a retired Chicago area securities attorney. Sounds like he is or was an outsider with only academic interest on the topic. 
It would be nice to know who paid him or what prompted him to do the massive research and writing. It might shed some light on his angle.
