3. Based on what you’re saying i must assume you are not following LN development closely enough.
Institutionals moving bitcoin wont need LN, theyre not buying coffee and can wait 15 minutes if they need to.
6. I never did and would never ask for you to reveal personal holdings. Im asking which coin(s) you think will overtake btc. 
Kind of one sided debate here since i have nothing to work w.
90%+ of alts are fraudulent offerings so I’m concerned about your claim thats alts are and will be better than btc.

LN does not have addresses. I have updated the article to explain Lightning Invoices.
LN is not by definition a sidechain but it definitely *acts* as one given that transactions are not broadcasted on the chain. i have corrected the language to avoid confusion.

"no institutional, no moon." -- me
\- Not all bitcoin investors must (or want) to hold their keys. Some people don't want to learn or don't care to learn how it works, they just want exposure, so why not give it to them.
\- If they eventually learn how to manage and hold their own keys, they can simply sell this investment product and buy BTC directly from market.
\- holding your own keys means you cant invest via gov-regulated accounts, which have many tax advantages and obviously is value-added to many.
you are the fool if you don't understand the above.

You sound very bitter. I would be too if my $1 investment was now worth $0.02 because i got btc fomo and got greedy buying illiquid ��coins.
People love to call it manipulation when they don’t understand market dynamics.
Btc doesn’t scale without LN but it will after and the fact that it didn’t before will make zero difference because people wont care, so long as it works. 
Remember that without bitcoin alts would have no liquidity let alone exist in the first place.
I invite you to look at the evolution of the top cryptos since bitcoin’s inception, alts come and go but btc reigns.
Also Interesting that you haven’t even mentioned the coin(s) you think will overtake bitcoin. Don’t be shy to reveal your big bags ��

Thanks for your comment, i appreciate your point of view. Please consider the following:
\- An exchange traded fund will not, cannot and does not change what Bitcoin is about, how it works or its independence from the traditional financial system
\- those who would invest in the ETF are not doing so to use bitcoin (BTC) for what it was originally designed. Investors that own gold and silver ETFs are not planning on making jewelry.
\- many individuals want to **invest** in bitcoin (BTC) but don't because of the inherent complexity of the asset (they don't care about its features and use cases, they just want exposure)
\- The rejection can be bad news if the SEC stays keen on the underlying spot market, although i don't think this will be the case (why is it legal to buy bitcoin (BTC) then?)
Food for thought.
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:10:40
anyone that buys bitcoin and takes the time to learn how it works will likely buy on centralized platforms and move their assets to addresses which they control the private keys.

this seems like a bold claim. most states require special permits and permissions for miners to operate. the US doesnt have and likely wont have a cheap source of renewable energy anytime soon.

@_date: 2018-08-21 16:07:22
It's a complementary payment method. in times of market booms and when the industry will stabilize, the infrastructure will be already available.  
As per user  the merchant receives fiat ultimately (or have the choice of keeping any % in crypto).  
The next step if for suppliers and manufacturers to start accepting crypto. this will allow to complete the entire cash movement in the supply chain and retain the crypto without needing to liquidate for fiat.
further, some have crypto they want to spend instead of their fiat so this is convenient :)

by quoting the **amount** of energy consumed and comparing it to banks *i must assume you are missing the entire point of the article.* you sound like the people this article was designed to silence.  
With the exception of China, miners operate using cheap sources of energy, which are all renewable and for which increasing output **does not  increase damage to environment**. No carbon = no damage

the rejection is not positive but i think the underlying reason for rejection will get challenged heavily. Also, having a friend at the SEC is GREAT news IMHO.
The SEC's mandate is not to assess the spot market but rather if the companies listing and managing the ETF can detect and prevent price manipulation.
Essentially, they are concerned that 'whales' will pump up the spot price of bitcoin (btc) before the stock market closes and in turn 'artificially' pumping the ETF share price.
Although a valid concern, it is not within the SEC's mandate and oversteps their authority. Users can already buy Bitcoin directly and easily (subject to the same price manipulation concerns) so the rejection is wrong IMO

Coinbase is a centralized and private company, hence the lovely comments but rightfully so IMO. This is arguably against one of the biggest pillars of Bitcoin: decentralization.
The beauty of Bitcoin (BTC) -- especially by now -- is that you can take full advantage of all of Bitcoin's feature rather easily without having to trust a company like Coinbase.  
If you are a trader, they have very respectable liquidity (Coinbase Pro, formerly GDAX).
If you want to invest quickly, easily and pay a big spread for the sake of FOMO, got for it there.
I recommend you learn the basics of Bitcoin and wallet security instead and buy coins on any trusted and competitive exchange available in your country. You can try a decentralized exchange if you're feeling extra adventurous :D
you will eventually want and need to learn this, it's the future ;)

IMO, the big names behind this ecosystem can be a huge boost towards adoption and usability. these names also have the power of making non-believers, believers and give another big endorsement to the industry.
Need doesn't mean that the network will fail and that BTC will go to zero if not. Rather, the narrative around Bitcoin *needs* to change and Bakkt could be the catalyst.
Bitcoin's price and media presence are currently largely influenced by anticipated ETF decisions and in part by China's participation in the market. Bitcoin (BTC) needs a catalyst to shift the focus in order to accelerate demand and adoption.

the way i see it, a hardware wallet is like having a paper wallet but with an interface (also MUCH easier to use). 
it's also a much cheaper alternative to buying a dedicated computer like some use to do in the past.
