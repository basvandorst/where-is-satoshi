Newbie here ... so apologies for monumental ignorance ...
Here’s where I am:
- new to crypto world
- currently own bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and dash
- I have bought (to hold) a small amount as part of diversification/future-proofing/investment strategy
I like the DASH world-view that crypto needs to make user-friendly in-roads before it will enjoy large-scale adoption. We need more features that come across like the Exodus Wallet, Paypal, etc … to normalise it’s use.
As someone trying to learn how it all works - it seems that most of the videos are either about how to buy, how to trade, why one crypto coin might be better than another, etc …. but very, very little material on the one thing that most new-users actually want to understand; and it is this:
HOW CAN I SPEND MY CRYPTO?
I know how I spend my Fiat - I hand it over - and the deal is done! How to buy a coffee, a meal, petrol (gas), etc - this needs to be totally apparent to the newbie if we are to bring the larger part of the population into crypto-use.  
The only thing I have seen that shines a little light on this subject is a Youtube clip I saw on SHAKEPAY. It seems to me, that this is exactly what people need. They need a CARD they can use - that will seamlessly and invisibly, take care of the blockchain magic that sits in the background (and should stay there - IMO)
Shakepay is a great step in the right direction … but it came across as a bit dodgy (too casual … not corporate/professional enough to be convincing to people who are used to dealing with banks, etc). 
Do many think other companies (other than Shakepay) will begin moving into the crypto space to help bridge the gap between the crypto landscape and the world that the most of us inhabit?
