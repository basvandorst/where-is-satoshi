I think there is a TON of people buying BTC for the fork.  Cause they will get "free" coins.  Post fork, I smell a drop in dominance to new lows.

I don't know why they would pick up Cathrine Wood.  Hopefully she sponsored the interview.  The other two guests were pretty grounded, fair, informed &amp; accurate.
But, Cathrine, said quirky things that annoyed me.  None of which are material alone but together they motivated me to pound them out here.
She called the cloud something that "started out an open source system".  That's not true, at all.  She sounds like she doesn't understand what "the cloud" is.
She went on to infer that bitcoin transactions are "free just like VoIP".  VoIP isn't free, you pay for bandwidth, with Bitcoin you pay for block space.  So, neither things are free.  
She said "The regulators are worried about Monetary Policy" but then contradicted herself, better than I could, with a quote from Christine Lagard.  Plus, the majority of regulators in developed world (including the US) have been almost entirely focused on Bitcoin from a money-transmission / KYC / AML stand-point. 
She kind of inferred that Bitcoin could be hacked like "any system" by hedging her statements surrounding permissioned chains.
She set up her note on volatility, with "We've studied volatility, you can measure it...". (First, duh, of course you cane measure it) After which, I was expecting something profound from somebody coming from finance.  But it ended up being an intellectual let-down.  She said "At one point, in it's history...it was less volatile than twitter and gold".  The interviewer basically confirmed what she was saying was an obvious trend likely to play out.
Plus...she measured total market cap of Bitcoin as BTC + BCH.  Who does that?
