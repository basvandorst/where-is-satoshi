We know what happened when BTC went down to 5.6k after the fork cancellation. We saw how people waiting for a dip took the opportunity and shoot it to the moon from there within just a little over a month at near 20k. As much as the bears are trying to pull it down below 10k , it's not happening. I believe we have already seen the bottom at around 11.5k and can expect it reaching 33k-38k by the end of the month.

This sounds like very good news. Instead of ban or restrictions, they’re allowing it and even promoting it, getting banks involved, and in exchange just to have the transactions documented and earnings taxed.

Bitcoin can be *both* in a bubble and  underpriced, simultaneously. It depends on your timescale.

Bitcoin is an inferior coin to most right now, but hope so it'll be fixed eventually.

If it goes down more, been wanting to buy all during all this month, will raise again to 20k if this happens, dont be doubtful about it.

Bitcoin is not meant for those who can't bear loss as it is highly volatile so keep doing meditation which help you to stay clam as bitcoin is meant for long term HODL.
