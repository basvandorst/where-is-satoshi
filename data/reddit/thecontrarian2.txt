What a fascinating report. Thank you for sharing. Your English is perfectly understandable. 
I am going to share your whole story with friends, but in particular I'm going to share some of your observations about Socialism with family members who won't listen to the dangers. 
I'm not going to ask you to reveal any of your planning. I imagine there's a system for exiting to Columbia or Guyana. I have no idea. 
As you know, the US is having problems with folks from Central America trying to come across our Southern border without approvals. I bet someone in your shoes would be eligible for asylum. Don't make the journey based upon my word, do research. But I sure hope you find it to a safe place and I pray that Venezuela gets good leadership soon. Unfortunately, I think Guaido' has lost all momentum. 
Good luck.

I'm curious, the instructions say, "To start using native SegWit in Ledger Live, please create a new account and transfer your Bitcoin to it.". 
Does that mean just create a 2nd Bitcoin account in Ledger and do a Ledger to Ledger transfer?

I feel like I should have an auto-sell order at 13K and an auto buy order at 11K. Rinse, repeat.

My biggest concern is that central governments may ban it, nation by nation, because transactions cannot easily be logged and taxed. That's exactly one of the strengths of BC, but it's potential problem for governments that need to raise internal revenue. 
Smart users can still use it with VPN's and other privacy protections, but your average Joe may not be willing to do that, or willing to break local laws. 
Time will tell.

No, I was speaking of Bitcoin. Trumps statement mentioned Cryto in general and Libra specifically. I wouldn't touch a Facebook product with a 10 foot pole.

Still, it's up from the high 9's to the high 10's. Probably unrelated though.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:01:55
Bit coins are risky but could pay off big. Stocks will grow more slowly. Find your balance. Put 30% in BC and 70% in stock. If you're young, put 70% in BC and 30% in stock. Find what works for you.

Any government that issues a fiat currency is going to have to say that they don't like crypto because they can't control crypto. Doesn't matter, I'm still buying. I wonder if there is a technical solution in the future for making it illegal?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:40:24
Yeah, but he landed on the up-scalator and will end up at the top again soon, but bruised and battered. And ballless. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:25:46
So I'm DCA into my coinbase account. I'll just have to figure it out. Tricky because it won't be taxed until you take the gains, but I'm not a complete idiot. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:35:27
I'm glad you raised this point. How is the government notified of your gains? Does Coinbase provide end of year documents that discuss gain?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:41:39
I bought at $400, 800, 6,000 and 20,000. It's called dollar cost averaging and it makes the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune less painful. I'm still up about 60% this year alone. That's insanity. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:45:36

Was just what I thought and obviously I was wrong. Regardless, bull equals up and bear equals down.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:35:38
I bet that's BS. 
I would have guessed that a Bull Market was called that because a bull will barrel through anything that gets in its way. A bear, on the other hand, will go into hibernation and sleep for months at a time. 
But that's just the guess of a goofy man.

This video felt fucking weird to me, so I started digging a bit. The voice is computer generated, that's not a human speaking. I work for a company that does speech recognition and synthesis, and I know. The pacing is weird also. 
I grabbed this section of text and did a simple Google search: "If you feel you need social media to stay in the loop, seek out alternatives like newsletters or RSS feeds that are relevant." and discovered that the spoken script is a 100% plagiarization  of of this website: 
You'll notice that video footage seems to be timed to each sentence. The video *could* be completely computer generated and ripped from stock footage sites although without further research, I couldn't prove it. 
The Youtube account has 1 subscriber and they are the link in the video description  takes you to a "Make Money Quick" type of webpage.
This is bullshit and probably almost 100% computer generated spam.

Obviously, it would have been later than my memory recollects then.
@_date: 2019-08-12 12:35:19
That sucks. Could you sell that many full coins without adversely effecting the price? 
I mined about 30 coins back in the mid 2000's and figured the hard drive was worthless. Some old 40 GB IDE drive that I threw in the trash. How many old drives sit at the bottom of landfills with bitcoins on them. That f'ing hard drive would pay off my mortgage now. No use crying over spilled milk.

Slightly related... I remember reading an article about storage methods and their longevity. You know which method one? Stone tablets! (records from thousands of years ago for the win!) 
Lesson: scribe your keys into granite for long term storage.
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:59:54
Don't recall exactly. Whenever bitcoin became a thing. I had a bunch of work PC's sitting idle and thought it would be fun to run some mining software. 2006? 2007? I believe at the time, 1 BTC was worth 5 or 6 cents. So 30 of them would have been worth less than $1.00. The hard drive was worth more than that to for some lab project. Thus history was written.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:31:28
Read the letter. No they aren't. They aren't letting you use CREDIT to buy. You can still use debit. In other words, they're saying "Gamble with your money, not ours". Seems completely fair.
Look up "risk of trading options" and you'll understand better. 
@_date: 2019-08-13 00:54:01
Yes. It just felt like more than 10 years had elapsed.

 I'm not convinced the dollar will die anytime soon. It is strong. The Renminbi might challenge it. But I think a global Crypto might challenge even more. But the dollar is safe for a few more decades.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:13:44
It IS a threat to the dollar. As an American, that does concern me, a little, but I'm more worried about me than the US government (aren't we all? Isn't that the basis of self interest?) 
The dollar is strong, but I reckon the Venezuelan bolívar was strong at one point to.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:11:44
Dang, I can't tell if that's an insult or complement. I was just asking if it could be a leading indicator. 
Regardless, I'm using it as a store of value. Volatile value, but the general trends has been good for me so far.
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:13:43
Probably. 
But it would be nice to find a few coins sitting on a flash drive or something, years after you'd forgotten about them.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:35:29
I did. They aren't letting you buy crypto w/ credit. That's completely fair and frankly, wise. I wouldn't recommend anyone do that. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:15:43
Thanks for the reminder. Had a Ledger Nano S sitting in my desk drawer for the last year. Never used it in fear that it was complex. It wasn't. Transferred all my coins off Coinbase. I'll still use them for dollar cost averaging every pay period, but I'll transfer to my hardware wallet either monthly or quarterly.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:49:56
That's stinkin' thinkin'. 
If you consider BC to be an investment, then just dollar cost average into it over time. Set it and forget it. Don't be crying over spilled milk. People that perceive themselves as idiots don't invest ;)
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:19:49
Or just dollar cost average in and forget it about it. Check it quarterly. And unsubscribe from this schizophrenic sub!
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:50:14
I'm drowning in a sea of information. :) But the dollar ain't dying anytime soon. If you're praying that it does, then you're betting against us all. Well, all us Americans. I do appreciate the incite though.

@_date: 2019-06-26 21:06:52
Now back to 12.8. 
Don't be emotional. Take one of these positions:
1) If you have faith in BC as an investment, keep socking away money and stop watching. 
2) If you don't have faith in BC as an investment, sell and don't look back. 
Don't be emotional.

If I recall correctly, Investors Business Daily endorses a strategy of buying on dips and dips are defined as a drop in asset value of 8% or so. I may be getting this wrong, but those could be triggers that might suggest increased buying opportunities. But I just stick my $100.00 per pay period in and forget about it. Dollar Cost Averaging for the sane and thoughtless (and automatic) approach. Trying to buy dips would drive me insane.

Whoa. I'd rather not see until I can tell everyone to fuck off. But this is not why I own bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:19:20
Simple answer - a solution against (in my opinion and at this time).
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:27:53
Different strokes for different folks I guess. I don't need the extra excitement.
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:20:09
Unless, as Op posits, you can ONLY do financial transactions with BitCoin, then it would fit the bill.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:48:25
Everyone says this, but it works great for me. Easy, easy to add at regular intervals. I haven't felt compelled to look elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:53:40
Typical of any investment though.
Right now, I'm just dollar cost averaging into BTC. The only bad thing I'm doing (according to this sub) is using Coinbase :)
$50.00 a week, let it ride. It's not a ton, but it could supplement my 401K.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:27:29

Basically trading on options. Can make you rich or bite you in the ass. For these kids, the bite would be bad, then we (the public) would end up holding the bag when they let the loans go south.

This is stupid. It means that companies that can aggregate products together for delivery can grow very big. It's the very fact that they don't manufacturer and produce that allows them to grow because they aren't constrained by manpower and physical plant limitations. But those same things are probably a weakness. The companies that make the actual products can continue to make them and sell through other channels while these companies could loose their popularity or channels. 
Bitcoin doesn't really fit into any of these categories. At least not cleanly. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:04:29
Well, I suppose my comment made no sense. But would you invest in dollars? The more I think about it, the more I realize that you would in the right circumstances and against the right currencies. I might throw another $3K in there to see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:07:58
That statement really gives perspective, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:18:19
Thank you both. I'm good. This is buy and hold. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:26:13
Yeah, I'm considering throwing a few hundred into it for an investment. But that's not the purpose of Bitcoin, right? It's not an investment, it's a form of anonymous money transfer.
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:46:35
Do you think it's maxing out? Low? Or impossible to tell as it must still discovery it's value?

I thought one of the main attractive features of Bitcoin was that it cannot be centrally managed in that manner. Bitcoin cannot kill PayPal. Users can only kill PayPal by stopping using it.

I've seen quite a few of these types of posts. Why are banks banning bitcoin purchases and such? Is it competition? Or is there a legal reason?

Thank you for the counter-point. I agree with this. I'm not a proponent of the wild wild west. I guess crypto currency has its place.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:10:37
Let's be honest here. This is probably a reaction of folks moving funds from the Stock Market to BTC because of the current US / China trade talks. No? 
Meaning, if the US and Jiinnaaa, reach an agreement, I would expect to see money flow in the other direction and BTC would drop back to 4K or so.
