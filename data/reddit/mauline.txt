Lightning doesn't need segwit. It's easier to implement with segwit but that's it. So lightning is not limited to bitcoin.

Thank you! And I mean that, too.
There are people on both sides having an agenda. My hosted server running classic is currently down because of DDOS attacks. While this is bad, it would be awfully wrong to assume core supporters are generally bad guys supporting DDOS attacks. The bad guys are actually a very small minority. This is true for both sides. Most classic supporters are just bitcoin lovers with a different opinion, not  disruptive sockpuppet brigaders.

Are you joking? Of course I could ask if it would benefit bitcoin to increase the blocksize to 2MB, but anybody answering "yes, I think so" would promote an alternative client and be censored/banned. How can there be a discussion with these rules in effect?
@_date: 2016-03-19 15:09:28
This is obviously wrong. If, in a discussion I say something like "I like Ethereum because it has feature a, b and c", then that can be viewed as promotion and if it's not Ethereum I'm talking about, but the other unnamed bitcoin client, I risk removal and a ban. 
So no, I cannot discuss these things freely in this sub and I cannot say, what features I like in a specific implementation. Maybe for other crypto currencies like Ethereum, but not for other bitcoin clients.
There are websites that allow one to see which posts have been removed from a reddit discussion. Just use them to see what gets removed in this sub. It is an enlightening experience.

There's another attack that cannot be really identified as such. BU supporters will likely start to shuffle around the coins from the minority chain.
With 25% of the hash rate, there will be only be 25% of the transactions until the next difficulty adjustment. If the mempool gets flooded with transactions, most regular operations come to a grinding halt. Exchanges and users not being able to transfer their coins might severely decrease the value of coins from this chain. 
The hash rate on the majority chain will also be smaller than before, but since BU can make blocks larger and pack more transactions into each block, such an attack will fail.

As far as I know, Hetzner has several locations. It might not be as smart as possible to run so many nodes there, but it's better than running just one node. It's wrong in my eyes to assume a sybil attack, just because a company runs several bitcoin nodes.

Yes, I can see the difference, but I've seen posts removed for even less. 
If the rules are so clear for everyone (which I don't think) then what about changing the comment order to "controversial" and expanding all the "controversial" comments, so that upvoted comments get burried somewhere below. How is that covered by mod rules for the subreddit?
It's really difficult to discuss this stuff without risking a ban, so I would prefer to stop here. But I can assure you that not all people criticising the mods of this subreddit are brainless morons, sock puppets and vote brigadiers. Some are, of course, but that's probably true for every sub :)

Hetzner is also providing colocation and rented hardware.
Looking at  it says "P2P BITCOIN BANKING". Google finds this bitcointalk link: 
This is the first time I heard about btcpop, but if I were the CEO, I would for sure run a serious number of bitcoin nodes. Most other Bitcoin companies do that too.

I have really wondered how one could determine that an account is actually a sockpuppet. Reading your answer, I see that this is fully based on vague assumptions and not on proof of any sort.
I can assure you that my account is definitely no sockpuppet. It's the only reddit account I have. I've read reddit for a longer time but decided create an account to be able to post only a few weeks ago.
I'm using the same handle on bitcoinblog.de, bitcointalk.org and several other forums. I'm a bitcoiner since 2011 as you can easily see from my account details on bitcointalk.org. I have even an old MtGox Yubikey lying around here :)
And now you (as a mod of this sub!) are accusing me of using a sockpuppet account being fair game for bans. How many bans in are based on similar "facts"?

Transaction malleability has been in bitcoin from the beginning. I agree that it is a good idea to fix it, but if it were really that important, bitcoin wouldn't have survived until today. There are ways to cope with it and blockchain.info not being able to handle it speaks more against their software than for an urgent fix. 
This is especially true, since segwit fixes malleability only for new segwit transactions. So even with segwit companies have to deal with transaction malleability for many years to come.

How do you know an account is a sockpuppet?
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:24:30
One might think there should have been time enough to add segwit transactions to the clients. Are there any reasons this hasn't been added while waiting for segwit to activate?

Actually miners **have to** jump around like this.
Mining is a highly competitive business. Having your competitors earn more money means they will be able to buy more and better equipment, buy this equipment earlier than you, bump the total hash rate and leave you in the dust.
What this means is that once one miner starts to increase his income by switching to a more profitable chain, all others will have to follow or they will be left behind in the long run.
Might be different for hobby miners, but if you're mining as a business, you have no choice.

People buying Bitcoin Cash makes the prices go up. People selling Bitcoin Cash makes the price go down.

So if you're doing a rain dance and it rains some time after that, the rain dance was a success? :)
Just because two things happen, they are not necessarily correlated.
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:16:48
Huh? It says: 
"46% of companies we track (below) explicitly support Segregated Witness (SF)"
So, first it's not 88% but 46%, if one counts "explicitly support == wants". Second it's not "bitcoin's companies" but "companies tracked by coin.dance". This makes two errors in just one sentence. Let's see if anybody can beat that :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:41:25
Yes, exactly.
