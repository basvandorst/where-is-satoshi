Just FYI- being white-listed does not save you from being flagged. I was told I was white-listed and guess what? My purchase was canceled due to high risk again...

I did deposit verification. It's odd because I've already had multiple successful transactions with them and all of the sudden they are randomly canceling my orders. Some of my transactions went through and some didn't...
Anyways, I reached out to them yesterday and still waiting for a reply.

Four weeks???
That's very unfortunate. I really hope they do honor our transactions. I just sent them an email and was very professional about the incident. It's completely understandable due to the overflow but I think we should definitely shed more light on this issue until people actually receive the coins they purchased.
Thanks for the info.

I like this idea as well.

Also, I want to mention the process for this to adopt another payment method requires a very long process from conception to completion. It's very easy for smaller companies to do but if we are aiming for the big ones, it requires a lot of approvals and a bunch of other stuff...I've asked multiple companies with great ecommerce sites to use bitcoins (for the obvious reasons). Make sure to ask for contact info for a manager/director of ecommerce. They have the power to do the change.
