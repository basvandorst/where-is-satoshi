Buy bitcoin on cash app.
Transfer to your pro account. Takes 10 minutes.
@_date: 2019-07-28 13:33:30
Right, because reddit is the support function for every single crypto exchange...
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:10:48
Start mining from your laptop mining a shitcoin as a hobby to learn the first steps. Then study how to properly setup BTC or ETH mining. I would invest the cash in BTC and store it in a wallet that you hold the private keys too. A private key is generally a pass phrase 6-24 words long that once entered can reclaim your funds if ever lost, or if you get. New wallet or a new phone or laptop.

You have 0 claims. You dont even know a flaw yourself. You just parrot. You do know JP Morgan and the US president and Federal Reserve chairman are all speaking about bitcoin being made of thin air. So they can scoop up more. YOU dont think this is happening right now WITH eTH? And you're helping spread the fud. You gave 0 concrete claims on how precisely eth is a shitcoin fundamentally speaking , probably cause you dont even know what ETH is...
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:37:17
Sir, it appears you spent 30k from years 2017-2019 buying bitcoin. What did you do with this? It's now worth 1m dollars we need to tax.
Sorry, I spent it on drugs and hookers....
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:34:12
You want it to drop so you can buy more. Half the people I meet who say that never end up buying when it drops 10-30% they just say it again. "Well it dropped, I called it. Now it will drop again, THEN I'll buy more."
- price goes back up...
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:04:50
You download a LN wallet like blue wallet.
You scan the coffee QR code. And send the satoshis(btc)
Whats so hard to grasp about this?
I literally send 1000 satoshis around to friends at work ALL THE TIME. there isnt a "dying need" to open your own node and connect it to channels to a coffee shop.
Lot of comments here look like Btrash trolls.

I'm a little more frequent than every month and with 15$
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:32:00
Have you actually compared cash app to coinbase in terms of satoshis received? I think you'll find you get about 10-20k more satoshi on cashapp even tho the rate is 100-200 dollars higher.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:29:24
You're exceptionally good at avoiding direct questions asked to you from my very first post.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:39:46
How did sending the bitcoin cost $50??? You've obviously done something wrong whe  coinbase pro, which you have access to, is free to send bitcoin, and no tx fees.
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:51:40

You feel this way and are rejecting it because society has taught you to reject your foresight &amp; intuition. Humans have the ability to feel the future and sort of predict it. I think you are feeling the future. Sometimes I have these feelings too where I'm like... oh my God, by 2024 things are going to be crazy. Then the other side says, no weakhands... calm tf down.

You know, as someone who works I.T. this is some of the most infuriating shit to read.
Why doesnt the app work? Does it not load? Does it not accept your KYC? Does it load then crash after 10 seconds? What's happening here exactly. 
Why did you even bother to leave that comment? Why didnt you just take that time and energy and make a support ticket instead? What does your comment possibly serve?
@_date: 2019-07-03 15:49:34

Wait, you were a bcasher? Lol why the hell did you do that? They literally ONLY Have big blocks. Bitcoin core stated multiple times that they would do big blocks just AFTER they solve scaling. Look at it like this. If your 3 lane highway gets traffic. Adding a 4th lane will only temporarily solve the issue until more cars come. Then you do it over and over... it's a bandaid not a solution.

Cant you buy bitcoin on coinbase. Transfer to foreign exchange, convert btc to stable coin. Send stable coin back to coinbase, profit then withdrawal usd?

The only secret crypto project anyone should take the time to learn about is the one that has partnered with Chinas  insurance company , their 4th largest insurance company, (yes 2 of the big 4) Cisco network, and lots of other multibillion dollar companies. The name is singularitynet.
@_date: 2019-11-29 00:45:19
How to hodl. Dollar cost average in small amounts at a time and mentally burn that amount so no matter where it goes, you really dont mind. Start out with 15$ if you can per 2 weeks. Then you can look at it as you took bitcoin out on a nice lunch date and that's it. Let it sit.

Every single exchange that lets you buy at a market buy it's going to be higher than the going rate. Try coinbase you'll see what getting ripped off is really like.
 Cash app is actually really good.

To answer your question. Its it safe to enter your SSN into cash app to utilize its services, yes. Yes it is. Cash app is a massive app and constantly growing. Now people have a problem here with you identifying yourself and buying bitcoin tho, cause you know. Privacy. And tax evasion.

Convert your money into ETH. Go to Conoound. Finance and lockup your eth in a collateral position. Say you lock up 1k take out 400 DAI (Stable coin) trade those for Fiat and do what you gotta do. It's better than totally selling out of the market. Hopefully if btc goes up, eth will go up too. :)

I use BTC and I visually calculate how many satoshis there are. It's very simple once you get use to looking at it. And if you see 0.1 that's 10m satoshi. A.k.a 10% of a btc.
If you see 0.01 that's 1m satoshi.
If you see 0.001 that's 100k satoshi.
Very easy to visually look at and see. 
Anything under that 100k is super simple cause it's only 99k or less. 5 digits.
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:41:57
People with more money than us will be able to bet on the future price of bitcoin on a daily and monthly contract. These contracts are handled using actual bitcoin, in the past it was dollars. (Still is, see CME group)
A lot of people are thinking that if last time futures with dollars are what propped the price from 4k-20k what would happen if it was actual real bitcoin being exchanged thru the network.? Will we go from 10k-100k?

Honestly, I've been thinking about this and I've concluded that they're already fractional reserve banking on these exchanges. It's probably why coinbase has a 6 day holding rule when you buy on their exchange. They probably dont actually have it just yet. But rather just put some digital numbers on your account. We all know the slogan, not your keys - not your coins.

Edit: look friend, im not saying your wrong. But i think you could be a bit more lenient on the matter atleast til 2018. Bch/btg/b2x are all new forks. So expect people to tall about there on this sub for a while. And except for rejecting them and telling them their post isnt good here, go away. Hurts our community as a Whole. See what i mean?
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:21:10
With that mindset you'll never have 1 whole bitcoin. If you can get 0.01 you can get 0.1. And so on and so forth. Just put your head down and get to work.

You log on gdax.com and you click deposit. A box pops up, you click "from coinbase account" then you enter the amount and click ok. It's really simple. Did you even check yourself?

Yeah buying at the 3k levels was the big turning point me now looking back at it. Funny. The most depressing time turns out to be the best time. Keep up your chin and dollar cost average. My price target is 500k 2024ish. Hodling til then.

I agree with you. This is a start of a correction.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:19:17
Robinhood is good but you cant withdrawl your btc or any other crypto for that matter. I've used it for almost 1.5 years now and they keep saying the withdrawal is coming soon. It never came. Also they are super slow with getting altcoins. They are just there on watchlist for years collecting dust. No progress. Abra is better if you are using robinhood.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:25:28
This is how you become a goood trader. Don't give up. Keep praticing. The first goal is how to not lose money. The second is how to make more. Atleast u kinda got the first part. So trust me. You're doing better than the vast majority.

Does it show individual % and $ increase for my positions? Say i made 5 positions in ltc. Would it say like, your first position is at 25$ increase (and i can toggle that to show a % instead) and then it's like your second position is a -9$ . Etc.

The proce is locked in. You can sell it if you want. Just need to sell on coinbase as you cant withdraw the funds for 7 days.
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:06:45
I'm sorry but you really didnt answer any of my questions when i said "obviously CB and Govt can track me" I know that the information is available to the public which is why i said "obviously" i didnt need your input on something i wasnt asking about. espically when its a non-needed correction thats not even a true correction as i was technically correct and you just expanded on my answer. You didnt explain how the agencys cn tell who is the owner of wallet C. I understand how data mining works. But that doesnt really answer the question on how someone who is not on social media, take my grandpa for example. If I bought bitcoin from coinbase, sent them to my ledger, then sent them to my grandpas ledger. How would coinbase realize if i sent the coins to my grandpa or to myself in attempts to obfuscate.

Sure you COULD set it up yourself and more than likely be fine. But why even bother taking the risk?  That's like saying you could study you a test for 2 hours using the text book. orrr you could just review the notes on your laptop for 30m and see where it gets you.

It's not that the crypto community is dependent on YouTube. It's that some PEOPLE are dependent on YouTube. I think the point is that some people have a passion for making videos on topics they like and now they cant get paid for it anymore for no apparent reason. It's not the fact that people get news from them or deserve to be rekt for getting trading advice from them. That's missing the entire point of this. You can't be this dense?
With your argument that's like saying....(imagine twitch streamers are getting demonitozed) "I dont see why the gaming community are so dependent on twitch. Dont people have better things to do with their time instead of watching nerds play video games."

Usdt is usdtether. It's not usd (united states dollars) those are 2 totally different currencies. What you need to do is sell your usdt for usd. Find an exchange that will offer that for you. Try coinbase or kraken or something maybe even Abra.

Just read your entire post and it's a great crash course for newbies.  I did some own investigation and some tests myself and looked into the blockchain explorer and answered a lot of my own questions dealing with utxos. I think now I need to learn about connecting to nodes and air gapping my ledger somehow.

Just buy it on coinbase if possible using the card. The. After 7 days. Send it to yourself.
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:41:19
It depends if you want a logical answer or not. You can look at cme futures as they attempt to be the primary source of price discovery. Yet they don't even touch bitcoin it's all paper settled. Yet their prices are able to influence/manipulate the real bitcoin.... or you can be logical and say in the long run, at the end of the day. Price is determined by supply and demand.

Other way around. If the exchange doesnt have your keys. And you own your keys. Then you own your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:32:36
It's not quicker because the difficulty adjusts means less miners needed to mine a 10min block. Say it takes 100miners to complete a "Hard mine" in 10 minutes than those miners were like too hard. I'm gonna leave and say only 50 remained. The difficulty would adjust so the  next 10min block is on medium mine.  So those 50 people can stick to the 10m interval. If its 1 miner left it's an easy time. Still 10 minutes though.
It's a difficulty adjustment more than a difficulty drop.

He's incorrect. Each year you still have to pay capital gains tax even if you don't convert to fiat. Say u buy 1 btc for 100, it goes to 10k in 12 months. If u hodl. You still need to claim that rise in value. It's the law. Go look it up. I'm dead serious. However most people aren't claiming.

Cinematography is average. What you would expect. There were 0 cinematic shots. 0 likes of dialogue. Minimal acting. How does the zombies and Hunter have perfectly normal clothes in a post apocalyptic world? Atleast try with the set design. Why is nd donalds in this? Did they get permission to film product??? Thats  a super no no. 
You kind of get that sense when hes looking thru the glass at a dead body that he's like. This is what the world is now, this is my life now. Thinking some deep shit.  Then the next scene is him at nd donalds somehow having being served fast food? Totally makes 0 sense. 
Btc reference was cool but the cgi could of been better.

Lmfao. Dearest dipshit. Even though it's a national news channel. Its my local gas station that is showing this. Not every gas station plays videos while your pumping. So why is this important since you're so dense you dont see the overall point. Its bitcoin awareness and adoption for everyone who is casually pumping to see and hear about in the background cementing its word every day. More and more. So fuck off with your toxicity.

1. Cash app. 0 fees. 
2. Abra. 0 fees. (What I do if I want alts, I buy in cash app, send btc to abra, exchange for alts. Takes 15m to transfer btc onchain)
3. Buy USDC on coinbase. Logon to coinbase pro. Send your USDC from coinbase to coinbase pro. Exchange usdc for crypto for 0 fees.

I've been dollar cost averaging for over 12 months now. I'm up  +4k and I only do 15-75 bucks each week. Usually around the 25 dollar mark. There are no cons to this method. The only con is yourself if you dont make a sell/exit strat for the future. Things will go big and you'll be standing around clueless in what to do, making reddit post like "do I sell" and everyone tells you no. And then the price crash and you are like shit... I should of had a sell strategy on the way up.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:51:14
Same here. I was Fomoing in at 15k-20k and dollar cost averaged ever since. Now with btc at 7k. I'm at +$x,xxx on bitcoin. Even though I have those bad buys.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:07:57
How did you get scammed for 5.5k when you only deposited .8?
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:51:53
Step 1. Buy bitcoin
Step 2. Download a wallet or buy a ledger.
Step 3. Click receive.
Step 4. Send yourself your crypto.
Step 5. Log off.
I recommend just using coinbase vault if you're too nooby for now. Later in life you will know what to do. Dont rush it. If you have less than 1k leave it on coinbase in the vault, you'll be fine. They're even crypto insured and fdic insured for fiat.

@_date: 2019-05-30 23:08:27
If you sent btc to yourslef. Why did it disappear??? Shouldnt you still have it.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:18:43
From 1.6 years irl shilling advice. Dont talk about price. Talk only about what it can do and how its applicable to the real world. If they ask you.about price. Say you dont know what the price is, bit isnt that feature great? ! Talk about being borderless and how u can send 100k to a friend in. N. Korea and there is nothing their dictator can do. And that friend will be able to spend it in 10-20minutes. Compare that to how much western union fee would charge and how many freezes would happen while the money is sent across the world. Talk Bout how bitcoin is a protocol, one in which many apps can be built on top of. How bitcoin the currency app is 1 of many apps ontop of the bitcoin protocol and many more apps will come in time.

@_date: 2019-05-12 14:13:04
Someone else gave you the coinbase tea. So I'll just say. Coinbase is insured by the government so take that for what you will. If you wanna be your own custody solution buy a ledger nano s. Or a ledger nano x. Buy it off their website and pay the full price (unless there a sale) do not buy off Amazon or Facebook. (They could be pre tampered) once you have your ledger nano s. Send your btc from coinbase to that. If you want to axe coinbase. Use Abra or Cash app by Square (CEO is the same guy as twitter)
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:31:18

Talk about how there are currently 3-4b people who dont live in a place of priviledge to have a financial system where it is functional or access to a bank. Now with bitcoin they are about to be onboarded to financial inclusion of trading and markets. And they can build their own markets. Shape their own economy.
