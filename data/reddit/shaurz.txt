Ah Windows, insecure by design (or lack of).

Just like socialism did.

This is all about the hunt for taxes.

If you received payment in BTC, would you keep it or immediately sell for $$$?

[Here comes another bubble...](
@_date: 2012-02-22 13:52:59
But... network effects!
@_date: 2012-12-03 09:38:56
So what about quantum computers? Are there any known good crypto algos that both quantum and traditional computers cannot crack in polynomial time?

I've not being paying attention to BTC for a while, last time I looked it was around $5. So it's on the move again?
@_date: 2012-08-24 10:21:28
Except when someone breaks in by other methods and steals your bitcoin wallet...
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:37:16
We are now seeing the first wave of news stories designed to create an image in the public imagination of bitcoin as something illegitimate and dangerous. This will create public support for when governments start trying to shut it down.
@_date: 2011-07-19 15:18:43
For how many bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-11-25 11:27:33
Sacrifices must be made.
@_date: 2011-12-15 12:16:18
Apple probably has a patent on that.

Rambus, eh?

Said every bubble rider ever. Prepare to lose your shirt!

So she cares more about your bitcoin than you...

An internet game played with real money.

Author of a book on Bitcoin and the former England goalkeeper! (Sorry I'm sure you've heard that a thousand times before).
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:46:02
Now we know the crash is near.
@_date: 2013-03-15 16:50:54
I wonder what the legal ramifications are for this, for example income tax.
@_date: 2013-02-12 12:37:14
Who leaves $200K in a PayPal account? I get edgy just having a few hundred pounds in there.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:42:44
I had half a bitcoin that I mined once. I would sell it now if I still had the wallet key.
@_date: 2013-02-12 12:43:00
I'm surprised that people will pay $99 for less than 2000 lines of JavaScript. Clearly I'm missing some opportunities...

I had an account set up back when they were Abbey National and never bothered to switch. Never really had any problems so it didn't seem worth the risk. Maybe I should switch to Halifax since everyone else in my family use them and I already have a credit card with them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:19:17
Why does it take 3+ days to clear when I send money then? And I've never seen an NFC card before.

I have £100 overdraft but I don't use it any more because I got burned on the fees. Pay almost everything on the CC now.

It's really cool that kids are learning such advanced topics at a young age these days thanks to the internet. It gives me some hope for the future.

With a fixed supply, the value of Bitcoin should increase proportionally to the size of the market i.e. approximately the amount of people participating. So I would not expect stability to happen unless the market becomes saturated and population growth on Earth also stabilises.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:20:41
Wish I still had my wallet key with 0.5 BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:10:26
Someone with 1000s of BTC they mined years ago. It goes to show how quickly and efficiently wealth flows when the government and banks aren't getting in the way.
