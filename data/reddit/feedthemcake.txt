When the truth is found, there will be so much disappointment from those who believe Satoshi to be a God. You're doing good work and it's very easy for believers to view this as some sort of religion, when the difficult questions are asked or some truth is found, it's immediately denied or some even grander scheme is created to give doubt. I hope this doesn't insane.

Too true, especially if you came late to the game and you're invested in this like a religion only to find out your God has a human face and a life outside of their teachings where they make mistakes or aren't likeable or handsome or 100% fair?

"The contract also contains a clearly incomplete sentence fragment and several other strange details and inconsistencies. On June 9, the date on the document, one bitcoin was valued at roughly $31, meaning that the million-bitcoin cache would have been worth about $31 million U.S., but the document values the sum at just $100,000. The contract also claims that Wright is facing bankruptcy. According to Australian public records, Wright filed for personal insolvency in 2006 and was denied, but records make no reference to an insolvency petition in 2011." 
Satoshi himself even believed bitcoin to be immensely overvalued. ha.

Imo it does. The world view of satoshi in Bitcoin is gathered from a small amount of forum posts and white paper, that's it. All of this other stuff could easily be left out of what you write on a forum. Plus if he was working with the guy in Florida, they may have one designated to write this out in public and the other working on problem solving etc. pretty sure everyone is going to be disappointed with satoshi being unmasked and him possibly not being the god you've all made him out to be. He is a human and going on the Bitcoin community online, he matches right up to me.

Newcomers ask this question, the old folk KNOW it's completely 100% without question manipulated by both users and exchanges and you're just basically hoping you don't get fucked when you trade because TA/Fundamentals/ETC do not work.

Wright is a con artist...who helped establish bitcoin with the assistance of Kleinman. They together are Satoshi, with one hand being experience programmer and the other being a con artist who has some cash to back the creating of bitcoin by paying Kleinman to clean up code and make it work. Doesn't seem that far from the story being told and makes pretty good sense imo. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:51:18
The brother of Kleinman wasn't it? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:18:24
old news.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:26:21
Satoshi wasn't anything but a human being...and one who is a cypherpunk and anarchist of sorts. " incredibly eloquent writer with a virtually-unrivaled presence of thought" can I see an example of where you've seen this? I'm curious because looking back through some of what Satoshi it's mostly technical.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:21:09
I think if Satoshi ever were to come out then yes it makes sense he would hire a PR firm. Did it go well or as planned? Nope. Not really unexpected though as this CSW has been a bit of a loose cannon and mess. Satoshi wasn't a saint like many in btc world seem to think he is/was. He's a cypherpunk.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:46:30
Anyone who read the story that came out a few years ago knew deep down he was a piece of the satoshi story. Everyone denying uses arguments that support that Wright was a part of Satoshi but not the entire entity. If Kleinman was paid in some form by Wright to help create bitcoin then they together are the creators of bitcoin. It's likely that Wright was the one using the "Satoshi" name on btc forums based on the writing samples and timing of the posts. Everyone originally thought he was English but surprise surprise it works well with Australian grammar and spelling as well...not so well with American and Florida time.

I was able to withdraw 45 btc that weren't mine in April of 2014 when it was about 22k worth.

Some people are buying others are selling. No trades have been made and we can't currently see any of the asks of the trade, all we can see is the bid which right now the high bid is 31.5 per 1/10th btc (or 315.00 per btc) that order could be filled very quickly (if you've had any experience on mintpal back in the day with alt coins, when a coin started trading there it sometimes would be WAYYY overpaid for in the first moments of trading because people just wanted to get their hands on the coin which could happen here but I doubt that, we just have to wait and see. I don't think trading has started as there has not been any announcement but they said Quarter 1 2015 which I think ends on Tuesday the 31st so if they stick to Q1 it should start trading before the end of Tuesday.

He needs to make the connection between a person he met briefly in 2005 (10 years earlier) and that face by memory with someone he is looking at on a screen behind him. Also note that the person who introduced themselves in 2005 went only by Satoshi Nakamoto where the person in the conference is going by the name Craig Wright. There you have a pretty simple way of not making that connection.
Often times I recognize a face but can't place where I know it from, especially when in a circle of peers who are all interested in the same activity. Imo it's not unreasonable.

Why not back to 0.50? Why not back to 0.25? Why 1.00? The bubble didn't start there.

How many bitcoin computers do you believe 21 inc has been able to sell for 400.00? It's all guesses but I wonder what people think or who will fess up to having bought one.
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:09:44
not at 400.00 a pop.
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:50:52
No it's 44k. All coins held in escrow etc. all of it.
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:37:41
Cool, congratulations on the piece!
@_date: 2016-07-08 03:17:20
Don't worry 21 inc will be gone in 2 years.

I think most people don't give a shit about most of the use cases Bitcoin currently fills and are happy using debit cards and credit cards. The majority of people don't think twice about what currency or store of value is/are and are just trying to get by in life.

It's terrible

IMO a huge rise in Bitcoin fiat value will come from new use case that we don't currently imagine or a use case where it's basically hidden from the user, for example the transaction taking place behind the scene with Bitcoin where the user doesn't even know it's being used, or from a store of value that is endorsed by a huge company or nation. I'm leaning more towards it being a store of value and the price rise will come as Bitcoin becomes more mature which may be as this generation matures and as a younger generation grows up with Bitcoin being available their entire lives. Might take a generation or two but I wouldn't be surprised to see bitcoins value over 10,000.00 usd in 20-30 years as long as all the b.s. is worked out with block size and also as the ridiculous love affair some users of Bitcoin have finally wears off. A lot of people popping boners over Bitcoin which is a big turn off and makes it look like some sort of tech joke.

He's making a show with a crew of 10 backed by CNN you think he didn't do any research or learn about BTC before filming?
