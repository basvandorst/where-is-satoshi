By the way, I'm not asking for money and you won't be able to figure which one of those public addresses are mine anyway, it's not the one with that goofy "please return my coins" note lmao
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:00:29
Good idea! :)
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:59:43
Basically I commit a series of "don't do"s
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:53:01
Never ever thought I'd go that route, but I am gonna file a report for sure. I half way expect them to tell me it serves me right, but we'll see
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:16:53
It's not just the newcomers. Sometimes all it takes is one moment of a lack of good judgement.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:40:33
No, but now I do
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:54:03
Fair enough. Nah I do t nearly have that kind of free time on my hands, just felt like giving a warning to everyone at the expense of looking like a moron, and I accept that.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:38:41
This has been a lesson for me, I'll have to look into that
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:40:33
It's true
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:56:08
And the address that dude posted is someone else lmao.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:36:18
Basically put my info as if I was logging into the website. Coins were gone instantly afterwards by the time I tried again. The "home" button on that site does take you to the real site and at first I thought I had mistyped my password, but when I saw the coins gone I looked at my history and saw what I had done :(
@_date: 2014-03-24 05:17:59
That's actually pretty funny
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:55:57
Funny thing is normally I don't. This is the first time I had it all in one spot, and that was certainly a mistake. It was really just perfect timing.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:40:44
did, thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:32:42
That's some else's address dummy, there is more than one roughly 16.5 BTC amount sent to this address.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:03:35
Nope, try harder
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:45:42
I'm a big fan of google most of the time, but something tells me they are just hoping we all just forget this ever happened and if they ignore it for long enough it'll just go away.
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:26:35
Love that polite public note asking this person to send those coins back. I wonder if this person grows a conscience or if at the very least they decide to collect their winnings and call it a night. As someone who got robbed by this guy I really hope he just keeps using this address like a dumb ass. This person is stealing serious money from very angry computer nerds, I don't think that's very safe, but maybe this guy is on some "hack into the CIA" shit.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:23:23
Joking. I think it would be much more likely that they would be less abrasive about it and simply claim bitcoins are out of their jurisdiction, but i'm on it either way. Even if I don't get my money back, this person should at the very least have a hard time getting away with this.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:04:37
I appreciate that, fortunately life has been a lot more good for me lately than bad. This was just a pretty big shock needless to say.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:54:49
I think this moment will make me less greedy and more Zen in the long run, but I fear things like this will keep crypto from really happening in our world.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:20:41
I'm blown away that this has gained so much attention so quick yet people are still getting caught by it.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:28:47
Lol that's not my address. Never asked for money, get it right.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:37:37
16.5 BTC which I know isn't huge compared to some of the thefts that have been happening, but I just moved to the other side of the country. It kind of changes everything for me.
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:28:18
First of all frequently read posts on this site, never felt compelled to post until now. Second if I wanted donations I would have just posted my account t rather then trying to trick people with some complicated bullshit diversion. I'm unsure why they left me with that fraction of coins left, but if you would do some extra research you would see that address has been tied to at least couple phishing websites now, and there is even a tiny donation to that address with a note about stolen coins.
It is possible to be too skeptical.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:32:18
It was a typo, simple as that. I'm not making any excuses, and I don't think this is a "bug" in the protocol, but it's worth mentioning since nothing even pops up when you type blockochain on google. I think it's a new scam tbh.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:26:14
I mean I know I lost those coins because I made a mistake and I still have faith in bitcoin as a protocol. I just hope wherever this thief is with his one testicle and his dick that doesn't work isn't making everyone lose faith in the network.
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:51:03
I am going to make that money back in due time one way or another, it's not the end of the world for me. I'm sorry to hear you lost that many. Eventually I truly believe security will become much better, but for now a lot of us are learning the hard way.
