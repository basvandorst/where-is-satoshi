Yes but you don't want to generate that address from your phone, You need to print the address for safe keeping, make sure the computer you use is offline at the time of creation.
And yes, it would take all the computers in the world 1454654654564654 YEARS to both create the same address
Here's what I would do
1. Get a clean computer, possibly one that has been formatted and scanned for malware/virus before hand
2. go to bitaddress.org
3. download the html files and save them on a usb stick
4. disconnect the computer from the internet completely
5. open the html files on the usb stick 
6. create and print wallet
7. send funds  to paper wallet
8. HOLD

@_date: 2014-03-05 06:57:19
I have made bigger purchases and chase hasn't told me anything, I think what you're worried about is making 10k CASH deposits which they wouldhave to report to the irs as possible suspicious activity 
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:50:51
hmmmm I have bought a bunch through coinbase linked me to my chase account, I am going to open another account at a credit union just in case, and if they screw me like that  i'm closing my chase account

wasn't the guy from BTChina anti litecoin? or am i thinking of another exchange?  I could of sworn it was the btcchina guy that said that litecoin was useless
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:28:21
no but if you run an exchange, pretend to be "hacked" and steal everyone's money nothing will happen, I will wait to see people going to jail over it to change my mind.

I would love to work for them and translate some spanish emails!
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:54:27
How else you would define how many accounts they have? having an account means they got someone to sign up, just like facebook, they base their numbers on how many people have an account/page... not by how many people actively use it... Sure it's better to know the number of people with balances in it but I still think the number of new accounts being created holds some form of value, would lead me to believe people are hearing about bitcoin more and the probability of purchasing bitcoins is exponentially higher ... just my opinion
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:19:55
I have 0 market experience, been trading for a few months now btc/ltc

Is it illegal to have 2 seperate bank accounts and only provide the documents to one of those bank accounts when a bank ask for them for loan purposes?  I was thinking of doing this when I bought my house recently since I make a lot of cash deposits but stayed away from the idea and instead just made cash deposits into my moms account for 3 months.  Always wondered if it's possible to do, I mean I know you could do it, but woudn't the bank find out? Which I guess they don't considering I had forgotten I had a bank account with penfed that I have never used and they didn't ask me about that one LOL
I wasn't worried as much about getting in trouble, I just didn't want to chance losing the loan because of it

hmmm looks like you can buy LTC and BTC with transfer from US bank account? can anyone confirm? This is awesome if true
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:09:00
Yeah I'm not worried about the price of bitcoin more so I was asking if this is a step forward in general acceptance and would bring in more users that may mean a higher price but I am solely worried about people using it more

What is Bankruptcy Protection?
"Bankruptcy protection" is the process by which a debtor is "protected" by a court while they reorganize their finances.
Protected from what? Protected from excessively hasty or harassing creditor actions, such as foreclosures, repossessions, law suits, harassing telephone calls, and the like. A more accurate lay-terminology for filing for "bankruptcy protection" would be filing for "financial reorganization" or "financial restructuring" under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:21:12
As of right now I don't plan to actively spend any amount, if I do want to donate to devs or something what I will do is order the amount I want from coinbase.com then as soon as the coinbase account gets funded I trade for ltc then send to whomever I am sending to.
The funds I am storing in cold storage are for investment purposes for me to hold and hope that LTC is the next BTC and it blows up in value, so I don't plan on spending it anytime soon, if and when that time comes my plan is to import the wallet to litecoin-qt then either convert to USD or convert to btc then USD

@_date: 2014-03-10 07:38:33
I don't right now because I sold them all last week at 700 anticipating the price to drop this week, I will re-buy here shortly to hold bitcoin and convert half of them to litecoin
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:18:41
I was affected by the freeze yesterday, I bought at coinbase then sent to my btc-e.com without me knowing that they had put deposits on hold, like 6-8 hours later they enabled them and my funds showed up..
The other reason is to leave buy orders so you can quickly buy at a rate you are looking for.
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:45:14
uhhhh buying bro

@_date: 2014-02-03 04:25:15
you should read up more, if more people buy in the demand grows and price goes up, there aren't enough full bitcoins for everyone in the world... we are still way early in the game IMO
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:18:31
I was just kidding, but yeah now would be a good time to buy IMO,  Unless news bigger than the gox fiasco happens I don't see the price coming down anytime soon, I am selling some today to cash in on the profits i earned from buying at 440 a week or so ago then going to slowly add more and more money to my investment
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:59:37
did they remove it afterwards? What questions did they have?

@_date: 2014-02-09 16:17:35
in this and every thread about people getting their shit stolen
-WHY THE FUCK DIDN"T YOU HAVE 2FA enabled? Sites should make this mandatory, glad you got your coins back but come on man!!! 
-People will rant about how it's too hard to secure bitcoins and label this as the reason bitcoins wont take off
-People will counter argue that the internet was not simple when it was first introduced and that took off
-blah blah electrum
-blah blah paperwallets ftw
-blah blah OMG LINUX FTW!!!
all of this could of possibly been prevented if you had just enabled 2fa man!!!

Sorry I should of clarified, I did NOT have problems with print drivers, I just didn't want to even deal with it, I didn't want to find out how to install the printer via ubuntu and the printer I had just purchased solely for the purpose of printing out a paper wallet came with the drivers via a cd install disk for windows, I did not want to go searching online on how to install it.... So instead of saying "I didn't want to deal with finding Ubuntu print drivers" i should of said "I am fucking lazy LOL"   It could of been plug and play for all I know....... I was just looking for the fastest solution without spending much time online, I just wanted to mvoe my funds quickly into cold storage....
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:09:09
you didn't miss anything, they said they will update as they make progress, meaning no one knows when the new update will be
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:05:39
it's unregulated so the answer is "nothing"
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:19:56
I don't day trade, but I am converting BTC to LTC in hopes of LTC blowing up
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:44:51

wait, WUT?
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:33:12
I went through the steps, i really like the GUI you put together so i can check it out without having to actually get to the page on my phone, the only question i had was, are you going to implement the ability to do a QR scan with the camera? the only thing i saw was an option to manually enter the address you are sending too but no way to scan

any news on WHEN secondmarket is launching ?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:01:42
That's a small protest..... Once mt.gox announces they are not giving anyone their money(just an example, not what I believe) ... that's when shit will get real, people are holding back right now being hopeful, there isn't much public outcry outside of this subreddit....
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:55:58
I use chase and have my account linked, made a bunch of transactions with coinbase, no issues yet..  
about to open up a credit union account here shortly just in case :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:44:17
I had the same exact problem when I was trying to verify months ago, I attempted the verification like 7 times before I finally got all the answers right, It woudn't be so bad if it just asked me questions about me, but one of the questions was some random family member that i have NEVER used in a credit application before, it asked for that persons age..... I wasn't about to call him for it so I just kept guessing, it was RETARDED!!!! I Tried emailing coinbase and they were no help
What I would do is check your credit report and see if you have ever had an address to that street, if you have never lived there maybe it's a typo, if that doesn't work then just keep guessing all the house numbers, as long as you get the other answers right you will eventually get that particular question right as well
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:30:38
please add LTC and you will have me as a customer

I trade on btc-e, but I don't fucking trust them one bit lol, only deposit, exchange and withdraw...
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:19:53
I always hear that term, can you explain what shorting is? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:01:56
I would like to say NO, fuck those coins, less coins means my current coins are more valuable.
NOTE: I lost coins in gox, but would rather not do what's suggested
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:24:42
enable 2fa on your email and everything else that might touch or have info on your bitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:27:18
wait wut, if you buy bitcoins you get the price you agree to pay at that exact time, isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:56:30
getting out this low right now would be foolish IMO, it will bounce back.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:47:36
Yeah I want them instantly to a) pay for something b) send to btc-e to make a trade

First time I have bought something via bitcoins, I have them just haven't used them to pay for anything, I must say, that was EASY!!! didn't have to get my credit card out, didn't have to enter all kinds of info, good stuff, can't wait to try it out

cool this is exactly what I was looking for, thank you!  are these pretty reliable? any fear that they will just die or stop working one day?  I fear that I will lose my phone, going to look at buying a seprate phone to only be used as a 2fa, but then also looked at this
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:30:04

I'm talking about a specific verified example, if there was one you would hear about it specifically, not the "terrist could possibly maybe use it"

I want it to crash so I can BUY more BTC, I want to buy 10k worth of btc and waiting for hte price to drop so i can make that investment
I meant dump USD not dump my BTC

post it here? wow forums?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:36:36
Same here, I still do a price comparison with amazon, I have found that the more and more I buy on overstock, the more coupons they send me, and it seems like the coupons are always related to something I would buy which entices me even more lol, just recently bought a house and have been using overstock for house stuff, so in turn they send me more nad more coupons for household items, which I need... do a quick check on amazon to see price diff, some items are same, some items on overstock are cheaper, then i use coupon and it's a bargain! The shipping only takes 3-4 days as well, so long story short, my business is going striaght to overstock from now on
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:10:27
great fucking listen, I bought a bunch of stuff from overstock before they took bitcoin and was happy with the service, especially the home stuff, Moving more of my purchases to overstock, DAT PRIME DOE

@_date: 2014-02-15 10:05:20
with the way they have been managing this whole ordeal i wouldn't be surprised if they were "testing" it on these production servers lol
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:38:45
IT depends on what you want to do with them, if your plan is to hold for a good amount of time I would suggest using a paper wallet generator on a safe computer and sending the bitcoins to that paper wallet, make sure you have copies
if you plan to quickly sell them the next day or move them around i would say keep them on coinbase, if not put them on your computer with bitcoin-qt, make sure you are EXTREMELy careful with them on your computer, make sure the file is password protected etc.... and no matter what you do MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 2FA enabled on coinbase.com do not skip this part
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:06:34
any more pics? how is the crowd there? would love to see account opened numbers or something
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:41:58
no not really, i bought about 10 coins and sold them right when they hit 700
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:36:16
just signed up for an account, website is speedy and the layout is nice, not going to add any bank account info until i hear more about it though
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:40:37
Did the key really get lost? can you point me to where it's stated? I haven't seen that but keep seeing people post about it.
@_date: 2014-01-20 02:45:41
Althought I am happy to hear the great news, 400k does not seem like a serious amount of money to get something going 
NOTE: I do not have anywhere near that amount of money, but doesn't seem like a huge amount to seed a company
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:28:15
I just wish coinbase would let me instant buy more, I have a  bunch of transactions and about 8k in bought BTC but I still have to wait 4-5 days on some buys... it's extremely aggravating when im trying to buy to take advantage of a trade.... or buy stuff from overstock or another vendor UGH!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:14:04
we going DOWnnnnnnnnnnnnn, great time to buy ;)

I nominate the bitcorn guy, dude is a tard lol
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:35:26
Yes you can, go to bitaddress.org to create it, the reason you read that you needed the blockchain app is to use their paper wallet generator, but bitaddress.org works just as well.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:24:35
I missed the last one, I want it to crash again so i can dump 10k :/
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:33:14
I want to know this answer too, I want a card lol
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:58:01

@_date: 2014-02-26 07:41:28
if you are in the USA coinbase is your best bet, you are going to need to verify though, unless you want to pay out the ass fees for using a card.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:34:40
I would be interested, would post up my review too

If mt gox turns out to run away with the money, fuck Shrem, seriously.... but I am going to wait until i know more lol
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:06:30
do they have the ability to make a deposit to my US bank account and can i buy ltc using my bank account? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:33:15
is selling them on coinbase bad? I haven't sold any but I plan to sell them back to coinbase in the future :/
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:16:49
so you're the asshole that prevented me from getting that plate :P
I tried to see if that exact combo was avail last night on the AZ site lololol, very nice man!
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:30:04
I am rooting for mt gox at the moment because I want everyone to have the ability to withdraw their funds, you are dumb if you keep money in it afterwards though.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:29:27
I don't know who made the site but I remember one of the guys running it was on one of the letstalkbitcoin podcast, that's how I first found out about the site
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:59:14
I saw the pictures and good job, looks awesome!!  As an overly paranoid bitcoin user, what measures do you implement that prevent against people hacking my computer and stealing my coins? can you explain how the extension works? Where and how is the private key stored?  Sorry if these questions are answered in the video, I will go look at that now lol
EDIT: Ok saw the video and just have a few questions: How do you get funds to the wallet? do you load them in the chrome extension or do you point it to an online account like coinbase.com??  Lastly, something I MUST have is 2fa, does your app support that?

Serious question: Why do you think he looks like an idiot? I think he does a good job doing what he does.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:12:13
There is a huge risk to sell BTC with credit cards, since the BTC transfer to you is irreversible there is a chance of what's called "friendly fraud" you buy the BTC then call your bank to tell them you never got it or anything else that would prompt your bank to issue a charge back leaving the vendor with chargeback fee's, no btc and loss of revenue, That's why you don't see people doing it, and if they do they charge a HUGE fee to try to cover some of their losses due to chargebacks, To answer you're question, i know there are some that offer it but it's not worth it due to the fee's IMO. If you buy with coinbase you are guaranteed the rate when you make the purchase, meaning that say you buy today at 500/btc, and hte price triples the next day, you still ge that btc @ 500.... After you get verified you can do more instant buys, coinbase still takes a risk as they are essentially loaning out the btc until they charge your bank account the next day, you could potentially have 0 dollars in that account and tha'ts why they ask for credit card backup
@_date: 2014-01-26 00:17:50
I have a qr scanner on my iphone, i load that app up, scan the code then send it to my email, i copy+paste it to the qt app then do what i want with the funds which is usually move htem to my safe paper wallet
do NOT leave hte private key in your email, delete it and make sure you have a secure password or 2fa on email, can never be to safe :)
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:40:59
Well I wasn't saying to have them release it and them control everything, but maybe market a new coin and help everyone get on that version, even if it's decentralized and maybe wont make a ton of money via fees but could you imagine everyone in the world using googlecoin to pay for something? would be awesome, could also lower fees they pay for their google wallet card??? I dunno 
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:41:48
I don't get this comment and it keeps coming up, explain? lol
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:08:05
I am not convinced confidence will be lost, the price reflects that already IMO
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:09:39
how are you trying to withdraw? BTC to USD? to paypal? 
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:49:10
hmmm what's the deal with that? any word from them?
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:28:08
To be honest I'm really not sure, coinbase and blockchain.info are both web based wallet as opposed to bitcoin-qt being desktop based, if I were to guess I would say bitcoin-qt is the most downloaded one of all.
and yeah, no prob man!
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:54:11
This is what I did because I didn't want to deal with finding Ubuntu print drivers....
1.  Formatted an old laptop I had
2. Installed fresh copy of Win7 Ultimate
3. downloaded malwarebytes/updated and scanned
4. I had liteaddress.org and bitaddress.org already saved on a  usb stick so i loaded that in and printed 3 copies of a key for ltc and 3 for btc
5. downloaded litecoin-qt and bitcoin-qt and let it update to latest block
6. sent LTC/btc to new paper wallet address pub addresses
7. Sent all funds to paper wallet addresses
8. Loaded private keys to both qt clients 
9. made encrypted backups of both wallets
10. used 7zip to archive them (password protected)
11. put a copy of each wallet on 3 seperate USB drives
12. stored usb drive in a safe and offsite location
I think that's it, a bit overkill but I feel alot better now lol, I made sure I did not go to ANY website on that fresh install of Win7, and it was all done in offline mode well except for ltc-qt and btc-qt updating so i could verity the private key import worked correctly and i could see the funds.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:15:17
shit happens man, it's the price you pay to play, if you could build it up a first time you can do it again :)

I have bought a total of 10btc in about 2 months, every time it's instant it immediately shows up, i never leave anything in the wallet, just buy then go to send page and get them off of there, usually I do everything in about 10 secs
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:58:03
They are already working on it as in they are implementing it, or are just aware of it?
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:19:42
Could they be selling off BTC to buy up LTC for Huobi launch? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:53:41
still wondering if I should invest in the IPO or wait till they hit the market.... decisions, decisions.....
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:31:23

the money is there in 3 seconds, yeah confirmations take time ... someone really going to put up the massive amount of resources it takes to double spend 20,30,50 bucks? I don't think so
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:30:09
can you only do it if you are verified? or would you be able to just create an account then buy some stuck btc?
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:05:20
not sure who has the most, but blockchain.info has about 1.2 million wallets/users
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:08:38

the logo itself looks nice, but i don't see how it would connect users to bitcoin?? Like what's the correlation? dunno just my opinion
@_date: 2014-01-21 15:39:04
this is awesome
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:58:56
So why did they lock your account? WHere you depositing from Coinbase? Did you get it unlocked later? I currently have Chase and I am worried of getting locked as well 
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:03:02
IT's not open to us normal folk, don't know what the requirements are but it's more for big companies to invest in like banks/apple etc...
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:52:09
what evidence is coming? i'm curious, not disagreeing with you just haven't seen it
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:16:51
and not a single fuck was given on this day 
@_date: 2014-06-07 23:11:56
I used to check it like 10 times a day, got pretty stressful I have learned lately just to sit back and check the price once a day, I only get on once a day as well to see what's going on.

yes, 2 days ago, yesterday and just this morning, each time it was 1BTC
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:52:54
anyone have any btc withdrawal go through recently?
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:39:31
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:07:21
It wont actively report to your credit but opening one might generate a credit pull leaving an inquiry and dropping your score 2-10 points, if you don't actively fill out credit apps you should be fine though
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:12:02
if I buy goxbtc from bitcoin builder, will i be able to retrieve that at a later date? say mtgox enables all withdrawls, would I be able to withdraw that same goxbtc to say my coinbase account WITHOUT having to actually create a gox account?
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:22:19
Yeah same here, withdrawals were paused for a few hours but was able to withdraw on btc-e 2 days ago, yesterday and today....  
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:22:57
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:41:47

well in that case, that's awesome and now I'm excited! lol
@_date: 2014-02-05 16:18:14
if you are in the usa then I would suggest coinbase.com to get your coins
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:58:04
I don't think it will be it's downfall but I do agree many people I have already talked to are shying away from it because of the risk of losing all your fucking moola, I am constantly also paranoid about losing my money, it's not a ton but it would hurt to lose it....
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:55:50
Hey I am sorry about that, I was wrong, The letstalkbitcoins cast I was talking about was about blockchain.info not blockr, although I have been using blockr for a while now, I have no clue how I got to it, it was probably someone linking me to it from the litecoin forums
the podcast I was referring to was ep 71, so yeah, no clue who the owner is, false alarm :P
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:06:56
I saw those, and well... they are a little pricey.... I was thinking something in the 3-600 dollar range.... Should of stated that sorry
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:13:38
yeah i have 2fa on my phone and I know it does the same, I like the cool hardware thing though LOL
