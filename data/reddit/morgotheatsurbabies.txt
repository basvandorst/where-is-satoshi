There are a few overused pictures on reddit that still always make me smile. This is one of them. Thanks for the comic relief.

And once you've put a ring on her, she'll never go down again. Do it.

Impossible, people are mining sheep faster than bitcoins in NZ. The algorythm is easier.

I'm not looking at Bitcoins as an investment opportunity, I really want to start using them, and contribute to the system.
But I'd hate wasting a chunk of cash today if the current value is going to plummet in a month... Essentially I want to make sure buying today is not a bad move, or if I should just wait a couple months until prices come back down?

I agree. I also believe it will eventually rebound to $100+ but it's probably not next week. I'm in a similar boat to OP, bought at around 135$ so of course I'm disapointed by the current situation. But there's no way I'm cashing out now - it just means I'm in for the long haul.

I know it's contra to the spirit of bitcoin but in reality there's nothing wrong with buying 5-10 coins, if they drop really low (say, in the $20-30 range), and holding them until the next bubble. It's a negligible investment and has a decent potential to yield a very good return. I'm not sure what's wrong with that?
Edit: just to be clear, this is not about getting rich, it's about taking a calculated risk with a small amount of money and giving it some time to pay off. I'm not saying that's what we want everyone to be doing but I don't think we should bash people that look at it this way.

Well my purpose is not to get rich (though I wouldn't say no, obviously). I want to 'jump in' and use bitcoins. I'm not looking at a purely investment opportunity.
On the other hand, I would hate to buy 1000$ worth of Bitcoins today at ~100$/per and a month from now, it's worth 100$ because they now trade at 10$/per. I'm just trying to gauge if there's a concensus that buying now is not just throwing money out the window...

I keep mine vac-sealed in the freezer, heard they last longer that way.

What ThinkGeek needs is reasonable shipping charges to Canada. Then, accept BTC for payments.

Thanks for the answer. So theoretically if I had bitcoins on Mt.Gox I could ship them to my Virtex account, sell them at this inflated price, then buy some back at a lower price on Mt.Gox? Assuming no lag on either end...

Thanks for the advice. This lines up pretty well with my interpretation of the situation as well.

If you're *still* considering buying on gox, you've learned nothing in the last 24 hours.

Either you are not thinking straight, which admittedly is entirely possible considering the amount of money involved in your situation, or you are a fucking idiot.
Saying 'the whole market needs to be regulated ASAP' is a load of shit. THE WHOLE POINT is that it isn't regulated. This was never hidden from anyone. Nowhere did you read anything indicating otherwise. You knew full well it was unregulated when you bought in. Now you get burned, you turn around and you cry that we're missing a regulating body? Go back to mutual funds.

Well damn... there's been a pretty good difference in value for the last 2 weeks now, I should really start looking into this... Thanks!

Yes, would be nice to see the source on this.
