Volume matters when looking at market cap, right now volume is about 10% of the marketcap, (it's normally about 5%)
I think that we could absorb a 1% sell off without going to zero. (If that is what you mean.)

What country? Here in Australia with your example.
1) Bought $600 worth of an asset.
2) Sold at $1400 netting $800 profit.
3) If held under 12 months make no modifications.
4) Add the $800 to your income for the year.
5) This now means your income is $36,800.
6) Now just plug into a marginal rates calculator and work out the difference.

Even that 20% for the stock market is too much, a lot of people think we are in multiple bubbles.
Normal economic growth is about 3%, anything sustained above that is either beating the market or signs of a bubble.
This doesn't apply to Bitcoin so much as it's an emerging asset class. However it will too eventually stop growing as much and turn into another 3% per year asset, although that probably won't be for another 10 - 20 years.

This is not just good, it's great. The rules so far are sane and actually welcomed.


Law actually enforcing some good security and auditing practice.


A good thing to do, especially due to mania we have at the moment.


This one goes without saying, no anonymous exchange will ever be greenlit by a government.


The law will expand this and it should eventually be easy to determine what needs to be done. It might be hard to implement but that is the cost of doing business.


Again, very sane guidance here.

I'm not sure about that. I still just hold almost equal amounts of Bcash as Bitcoin as I think there are enough people that wanted the bigger blocks fork for it to stick around.

If you're interested, Ethereum will implement a constant fixed supply of coin forever.
Of course this trends towards 0% inflation over time as the amount of coin in existence starts to dwarf the annual mined coin.
I prefer Ethereum's idea of a constant supply of a fixed amount of coin over the idea of a fixed percentage of released coin.

The blockchain of Monero will be about 5 times larger than Bitcoin, and yes, there is no script.
If you see something like Monero working alongside Bitcoin (Imagine in Litecoins place) then it makes sense. Monero isn't trying to be a Bitcoin replacement, it's only trying to do one thing and do it well (anon).
Script is important, but Bitcoin is the top dog, the general purpose and will not be going away, instead of Monero competing with that they seek to offer a compliment to Bitcoin.
Remember if Monero or a like coin grows, you can use an anonymous crypto only exchange to move into and out of Monero, and that in itself adds anonymity to Bitcoin. 
I see it only as a compliment and don't see the need to compete with Bitcoins strengths.
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:23:40
Not sure where you learnt that selfish mining means submitting a block every x minutes. The idea is to get ahead by pushing the known blocks at the exact moment another miner pushes their block, because they have 1 ahead to force a longer chain and void the chain that the other miner created.
I have never ever read anything about blocks being every 10 minutes for this attack, either your source is misinformed or you made that up.

Dude what are you smoking. There needs to be a lot of proof before Satoshi pays tax.
1 - It might not be him.
2 - He could have "lost" 99% of the keys before they were even worth anything.
3 - Tax law in the USA is evolving, even if he decided to admit his holdings he might not be required to pay tax. (Unlikely)
4 - No real proof it was certainly Satoshi mining the first million or so coins.
5 - He could easily claim to only command 20,000 bitcoins for example, pay that tax and leave the rest alone, no one could prove otherwise.

Honest question, if these features are what you consider "needed" why don't you use other coins?
I thought the rhetoric here was that no one needs any of those things, hence why everyone should hold.
I suppose this might be a reason why those "scammy, shitcoins, poor copies of Bitcoin, only designed for PnD" are actually doing so well, because they have features that the market demands.
Are you actually interested in these features or just interested in adding them onto Bitcoin so that it's dominance in the market doesn't decrease, which helps your networth?
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:08:44


Yeah no, I am invested in both Bitcoin and alts and the only thing that would make me consider rebalancing my portfolio would be a truly decentralised sidechain with a trustless peg.
Right now the tech doesn't exist, and this sidechain is literally the same as sending your coin to a centralised service.
The marketing has got a lot of bitcoiners confused. This is not what it's marketed to be.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:04:49
It is federated. I want Bitcoin to succeed but federated sidechains offer less security than most alts.
This is basically a centralized service and is not a true extension of Bitcoin.
I'd love for a decentralized sidechain to be possible.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:11:17
Bitcoin 2nd layer isn't too bad actually, LN does have some issues but I think it's actually pretty cool.
sidechains however are not good. Until someone makes a trustless two way peg sidechain that is not federated, these sidechains are literally the same as a centralized service.
RSK and Liquid are no more decentralized than that of a company offering a two way peg into their controlled ecosytem.

This is why Bitcoin is dropping, because no one actually wants to use it for anything.

By the time Bitcoin / LN, Ethereum / Raiden, etc... are so easy to use Grandma is either using them directly or indirectly they will be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions.
Or put another way, people use Facebook every day, do they know how HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX, JS works? Nope.
Yet they still seem to use that advanced technology with no issue.

DCA isn't about waiting for the right time to buy, basically if you have the money for 1 bitcoin now, you should probably buy it now and forget about it (if you believe in the investment. This works best for value investors buying stock.)
Anyways, dca doesn't mean that you spread the money you have now over a period of time, it means that you don't wait until you have the money for a bigger purchase and then buy in one go.
For example:
Proper use of DCA: I make $10,000 per year, should I wait until I have $5,800 to buy a whole Bitcoin when the time is right?
NO! you should start DCA with your money now, each week buy what you feel you want to invest into Bitcoin. So if you want to invest $5,800 per year, you split that into x weeks to make the smaller purchases. This assumes you do not have any excess funds right now.
Improper use of DCA: I have $5,800 and want to buy a bitcoin, instead I will DCA over the next year.
Remember, assuming you're buying a good asset, time in the market will on a long enough time line beat timing the market.
If you have the money for one Bitcoin and instead DCA that money (which is not the point of DCA) you're actually trying to time the market.
Wether or not your asset is a good investment is an entirely different discussion.
I do think Bitcoin will hit $2,000 in the next 12 months though just because it's a pretty piss poor investment, same with every other crypto. It's all a complete joke at this point.

For real? Bitcoin's market cap could be pushed into the trillion dollar arena with "China's risk-loving mom and pop investors".
Also you need to understand why the Chinese make the investments that they do. It's not because they love risk, it's because they have very few legitimate places to park their money.
The Chinese stock market is corrupt and they know it.
The currency is manipulated.
The property market is in a huge bubble.

Time in the market is worth way more than timing the market.
If you believe in the coin just buy it. Here's the deal, it will most likely get cheaper but there is nothing you can do about it unless you wait it out, and how long will you wait it out for? Too long?
Also note that your time is money, if Bitcoin drops 10% in the next six months and you check in every other day to determine if you should buy, you've probably wasted $1,000+ of your time worrying and checking in when all you saved was $40.

Here is the problem, you download the program and run it wearing out your computer and generating costs in electricity for about 10 years, and at the end of the 10 years you're left with $1 worth of Bitcoin.

I can use Bitcoin via a Bitcoin debit card, I know I know it still goes through the traditional mediums but I can be at a shop, and immediately transfer Bitcoin into my card and buy something with it.
So I can buy goods with Bitcoin, but I do need to go through this middle man company to do it. It's very useful as I get to keep my Money in Bitcoin rather than fiat.
Also with certain upgrades like sidechains and lightning network, one day it'll be effortless to make direct BTC transactions in the real world.
Why do all of this? Because it's a universal currency, one day it'll click and it'll become a standard for tourism, etc...

This is a pretty poor mindset. The early bubbles burning people were not that big a deal because the network effect of burnt people leaving crypto was so small.
But now with so many people that have lost everything, everyone now knows crypto is tulips.
I have been in cryptocurrency for years and am a very earlier adopter of Bitcoin and I can with great certainty that this bubble crash is far worse than any before it, and not because the value of the coins involved, but rather the negative public backlash.
Know almost everyone I know only knows about crypto as that giant scam.
And with each dump more and more people are burnt forever. I fear we have used up all the fools.

On a technical level yes, but on a legal level no. The Government in almost every country has sovereign right to all wealth. For example if the Government audits you and you lie about how much Bitcoin you have, it's as a good as gone, because the moment you're caught spending Bitcoin that you declared you did not have, you'll be jailed or fined for fraud against the state.
So you can't evade taxes with Bitcoin, for you to cash out you must declare it.
If your government ever initiates a wealth tax on Bitcoin you'll either have to declare and pay x% per year or not declare and lose the ability to ever spend it again.
Also due to the larger number of youth who are interested in social policies, most governments will enact 1%-5% wealth tax over the next few decades.

Australia is a terrible country for Bitcoin adoption, I also live here and the banking system is so advanced compared to most other countries.
The only reasons to use crypto over existing investment vehicles is because you think it's going to do better than an index fund or property.

Can hardware wallets produce a raw tx? If so then you can use some web wallets to send raw tx and it's impossible for the tx to be modified without the private key.
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:38:22


You're not exposing your private keys, you're just signing and then broadcasting another transaction with the same private key. Nothing is exposed.


There are some command line tools that can craft raw tx and broadcast. Obviously the core client won't let you do this. But raw tx crafting is possible (but dangerous, as everything from an input not allocated to an address (output) becomes the fee. People have lost thousands of bitcoin this way.)


I think that might be because the clients are smarter now than they used to be. Back when I tried (3 years ago) I had no issue. It showed up on the blockchain.info website as a double spend but after my second tx went through everything was good. 


Perhaps the core client and the one the miners use has better double spend detection capabilities? I'm a bit of a Bitcoin old timer. :p
If so that is a good thing and makes accepting 0 conf a possibility.


I agree with this. :)

RSK is a copy paste of Ethereum as far as smart contract functionality is concerned.
Also they are far too behind to attract any meaningful development. (As they are not providing us anything new)
At this stage actual innovation will prevail as competition to ETH, like Tezos for example, but not this. There is no innovation to be seen here at all.
But sure, keep treating RSK like your religion and see where it takes you.
I still hold BTC, but not because of RSK.

I have plenty of hard drive space so I run full nodes for Bitcoin and Ethereum, I really believe in being apart of and supporting the networks that you're invested in.

I am not sure putting nodes on AWS/Major cloud providers is a good idea as that creates a single point of failure that may be taken advantage of with an outage.

You confusing terms here, what is almost instant is the transaction broadcast (the notification that a transaction is pending to the nodes for inclusion into the next block)
The transaction can be double spent or possibly even rejected and ignored by the miners. (If all the miners in the world decided to not process your transaction into the next block for whatever reason.) Then your "transaction" will remain pending for a few days before being dropped from the mem pool.
Don't worry though, there has never been a transaction rejected by all the miners, thankfully there is no mining cartel. :)
Essentially the biggest risk factor is that the transaction can be double spent, only 1 confirm and more can be considered a finalized transaction. 0 conf can be double spent. (Send the same tx back to yourself with a higher fee.)
Think of the 0 conf tx in mem pool as less a waiting list and more a possibility set where 1 or more possibilities for each input -&gt; output exists. It's not a 100% guarantee that the tx expected by the receiving party will actually happen.
So honestly, Bitcoin transactions are not instant, as the transaction cannot be considered complete until 1 conf happens.

I may get down-voted here, but I invest in a small amount of what you would call alts. They have done me very well and even if they all crashed tomorrow I would still be holding more Bitcoin than I could have had before. (Even though I still hold more of these particular alts than Bitcoin.)
But some of these alts are legitimate networks and communities and this space is too important to have just one contender.
I am anti Bitcoin-maxilmalist and also I am anti-Ethereum maximalist.
In the past I feel Bitcoin's community has been too toxic against competitors, however I unfortunately see some in the Ethereum community fall into the same trap. I am sure that saying about history repeating itself applies here.
My focus has always been to find alts that I believe have good reasons to exist, good purpose and legitimate communities that remind me of how Bitcoin used to be before the scaling debate took over. I am also convinced Bitcoin will pull through this and be worth more than ever, however I don't think it will become the same 95%+ dominant coin it was before. And that is healthy. It's ok for Bitcoin to be worth more and more, and Ethereum to be worth more and more, even if over time both of their percentage dominance over the crypto space falls. That is the sign of a mature market in my opinion.
Unfortunately right now a lot of the crypto pie is made up of some questionable characters, including Ripple.
Of all of the large alts that have been going up, one I could not hold at all was Ripple. It was never explained to me why it went up, what fundamentals make it a great hold and what innovations it is bringing into this space.
If you ever invest outside of Bitcoin again consider a few things:
1. How big will your slice be? Buying into Ripple that technically had a larger marketcap than Bitcoin is insane. What motivated you to do that?
2. Is that coin offering the world something innovative? Remember that Crypto doesn't stop at Bitcoin, but honestly there are less than 10 innovative cryptos in existence right now.
My advice would be to never trade away your Bitcoin again unless you can seriously learn from this.
I made a mistake investing into a Bitcoin mining company many years ago and lost many Bitcoin. It hurt and I learn't so much from that hurtful experience.
However I see many people unsure of how to really pick a good investment in this space.
If you're one of those people either never divest again or spend the next 12 months reading and learning before divesting even one Bitcoin.
Good luck!

Go far enough back you'll see I was very much into Bitcoin, also check out my earlier history on Bitcoin talk.
I still hold a reasonable amount of Bitcoin so if RSK works out then cool, I make even more money. I just think Ethereum is a really cool technology and the community is super awesome, that is all.
I think it's quite lame that RSK's rise to fame is a copy of the EVM.
Why not do something different, at least Tezos is trying something else.

I made a larger post to you above about alts in general, how there are only a few worth investing in.
My main point is for you to research and learn long before ever selling another Bitcoin.
I believe in some alts and have very good reasons for holding them. Some alts I may never sell for BTC due to my reasons.
But unless you can learn and understand that yourself please don't go buying ETH.
Also holding BTC is a totally legitimate move, perhaps the best you can ever make. (considering what you have been through, trust be I understand the pain and it took me a long time and a lot of research to recover. Honestly it is far easier to hold you BTC and BTC will always been the surest bet in this space.)

The anon example is pretty good and I agree with it, mainly because you get in and get out.
However with smart contracts that might power actual services and businesses of the future, it would make more sense to be using a chain that natively supports it for security purposes rather than a tacked on side chain, because it's not a quick get in and out situation.

I don't understand this. Everyone will happily admit in a certain area Bitcoin has first mover advantage, for example with being a store of value.
However Bitcoin maximalists will say that Ethereum for example does not have first mover advantage as once RSK copies all the Ethereum code all the developers will flock to the copy cat side chain.
So my logic is this:
A. If first mover advantage (network effect) matters, Bitcoin will remain a store of value and Ethereum will remain king of smart contracts.
B. If first mover advantage (network effect) does not matter, then Either everyone flocks to RSK on Bitcoin or everyone flocks to Ethereum or another crypto.
Honestly, (A) is much more realistic.
If you logically believe that Bitcoin will remain relevant because of first mover, then by the same logic Ethereum will remain relevant because of first mover in it's area.

I realized a long time ago it's not going to be that easy.
I realized a long time ago that there will be inevitable competition no matter my ideology. I knew this would happen even back before the first legitimate competitors.
Perhaps I will be proven wrong and Ethereum, Tezos, Zcash, Monero, Byteballs, IOTA, etc.. will all be destroyed to leave only Bitcoin.

As I hold both ETH and BTC these numbers are somewhat informative.
* 0.003 BTC per person.
* 0.0214 ETH per person.
That is how early we are.

So if you bought a btc for $10 and then purchased a meal with it later ($40) you need to pay tax on that $30 difference, excluding any VAT/GST. So advice I had was too move the coin you are going to use to buy things, move it to a special wallet and pay capital gains on that wallet amount for the profits made and then legally you should be able to buy things like normal without being hunted down.

How many people know about them? 
All I am trying to say (perhaps not very well) is that when the average Bitcoin user finds out how people can track the transactions easier than cash and how the ledger is more open to the public than their credit card it might harm the public image of Bitcoin.
I might be wrong though...

Yeah that makes sense, if the exchange allows the bots to sell and move the coin near real time. But you always have the lag of the bitcoin network itself. (I think that would make a difference)

This is not fair as weexchange is used as an intermediate wallet to transfer in and out of Bitfunder. I assume the OP was moving coins from the Bitfunder exchange into an address he controls and he would have to go through weechange to do this.

Litecoins are mostly tied to the Bitcoin price, Litecoin USD is almost a duplicate of Bitcoin/USD.
Look at BTC-E if you don't believe me, also note how the LTC/BTC market has way way more depth than LTC/USD. Most people trade LTC against BTC not USD.
So what I am saying is that a BTC crash will mean a respective LTC crash.

See my reply to GernDown, please do not use Just-Dice as a mixer, dooglus has no incentive to destroy the internal transaction path of your coins because this would attract the wrong kind of people (with no benefit). As far as I know he has no plans to help people with mixing their coins

My point is that I think its all a ruse to sell this xrp for btc, I actually believe that is one of their main business strategies. (especially in case the actual ripple system does not pan out)
Look at the value of xrp, its way over inflated. Opencoin hold well north of $500,000,000 worth of ripples with no real use yet except for trading bitcoins.
I might be wrong but I have a uneasy feeling about them. Thats why I go on about the price, because I think its a cornerstone of their business to convert as much into Bitcoin as possible.

Looks like opencoin and friends need another round of over inflated XRP to BTC conversion.
But yeah I am wrong and its makes perfect sense for XRP to hover around 50% to 110% market cap parity with Bitcoin.
By the way muppets, whenever you buy XRP from a exchange guess whos buying? opencoin and friends.
Its actually kind of genius, create a worthless currency and release 0.001% to the public, create artificial scarcity and get people hooked into the idea that its the next Bitcoin and then just sit back and convert your 100 billion XRP slowly into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:47:59
I think the argument being made against Bitcoin energy usage is that for the amount of transactions taking place the energy usage is really high. (For example in the USA alone there is around 2,500 ATM transactions per second, this does not include internet payments at all) and Bitcoin's hard limit is 7 transactions world wide per second.
If Bitcoin becomes as large as MaterCard and VISA it will be worth a lot more and thus there will be a lot more miners. The energy expenditure would dwarf current payment/minting networks

If they invested $100 million into their own ASIC fab they could mount a 51% attack no problem. 
This potential is only removed after tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of ASIC's exist in the wild. I am hoping this happens sooner than later.

Well, because bitcoin is 99% reliant on the Satoshi client, and that client is maintained by Gavin as the lead, and the Foundation pay him. 
That's as much as I can think of actually, the client is maintained by bitcoin.org, not sure who manages that

I'm not sure exactly how infeasible it is, I heard it wasn't really worth it for smaller purchases because it was a costly and difficult attack. I'm not sure about the finny attack either. I wasn't aware it ever worked.
I asked this thread on Bitcoin talk in case some experts other there know the answer because I don't. feel free to see if anyone replies.
I hope 0 confirmations are feasible thing for the bitcoin community because it will help POS for retail a lot.

If you use CoinJar for its use, converting between AUD and BTC this is fine. The only way you can be robbed is by leaving money on their service.

@_date: 2013-06-06 14:40:48
Do you move Bitcoin between the two wallets? If so its certainly trackable. I've been thinking about building a program to demonstrate this, the program would attempt to determine addresses that send to other addresses more than once and watch these sets of addresses as mini networks to determine if they belong to the same person/organisation.
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:22:38
Well the bitcoins are just a number, if you bought a bitcoin from the seized funds and you had 9 bitcoins in that address, now 10% of your bitcoins are from the seized funds. Eventually many people would have a small percent of their funds being the seized bitcoins.
Once a bitcoin gets added to the balance of an address, you can not tell apart which bitcoin was what as they are not separate units. The only way to keep a seized bitcoin would be to send it to an empty address and never mix it into any address with a balance.

You are right, the supply will exhaust around 2100 instead of 2140 at this rate. However the lower reward might stop a lot of miners so we can't be certain if the current increases will continue.

@_date: 2013-03-24 13:34:38
First point, when you said supply and demand is the only factor determining how many can be traded, there is currently a hard limit on the amount of transactions allowed (7tx/sec) and I was implying that eventually, probably within this year we will start to get large transaction queues where we can no longer trade bitcoins because of this limit.
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:21:48
You make a good point, however the issue I am concerned about is to the average person Bitcoin offers less privacy than cash and allows anyone to snoop on someones spending habits.

Yeah I just read,  this is complete different side to the story.

The trust is in the people willing to accept Bitcoin for goods and people willing to trade Bitcoin for a price. 
Instead of trusting a bank or a government, your trusting millions of people.
The math is one thing, but if everyone turns around and decided Bitcoins have no value, then they will have no value.
Interesting times indeed.

* Anonymity - If Bitcoin does not do it another coin eventually will, then we'll see what the most popular crypto-coin is. (If zero-coin gets created and proved to work within a reasonable usage of blockchain space, and Bitcoin says no and another alt coin then uses zerocoin as its basis, I will sell all my Bitcoins and invest in the alt that uses zerocoin. Do not underestimate this one).
* Max block size - its being discussed, i'm not sure what the solution is.
* You either have to be a full node or no node, no distributed node alternative - Imagine if you could be 1/10 of a full node or 1/1000 of a full node. If the block size became unlimited some form of distributed node would be required, otherwise only the big players could be a node.
* Energy usage - I don't think this should be an issue. This is the price we pay for a secure decentralized currency. HOWEVER many people will use the energy statistics to make Bitcoin look bad. The energy issue will be played up by the likes of Paypal and Ripple in the future to discredit Bitcoin. So whilst I think the energy issue shouldn't be an issue, I have to admit it is because competitors will use it against us in the media and public perception.
* Zero confirmation spend is risky - Bitcoin in its current form is not quick enough for POS (Point of sale). And zero confirmations apparently is too easy to abuse. However if the max block size is set forever at 1MB this is irrelevant because the smallest bank in Australia will be able to handle a thousand times the transaction volume of the entire Bitcoin network making POS impossible anyway. (Our current hard cap is 7 transactions a second. With 1MB as the limit Bitcoin can never ever ever process faster, and this is a walk in the park for VISA, MasterCard, Paypal, etc...)

If coins are going back to an old addresses it's likely this is an exchange. The client attempts to avoid address reuse.

For any small purchases (up to the price of a car) 0 confirmations is enough.
