Isn't the point of BIP 38 to passphrase protect your private key?

How would you key in a passphrase on a usb device?
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:28:33
My point is more along the lines of, they probably won't support BIP 38 because there isn't a way to input a passphrase on the USB stick.

I'd be interested in this. Would it be useful for me to use an older phone with the sensor and just plug it up and leave it outside?

I recently traveled to Salt Lake City and ate here. Great pizza. I'm not affiliated with the business at all, but I was a customer.

ARG, that's the only one I didn't try. I had the BBQ Bird, Cheese, Pepperoni, and the Salami and Mushroom.

I told him I didn't know anything about Quark, and that my experience is in Bitcoin/Litecoin. I read the Wikipedia entry on Quark, but didn't see that mentioned. That's a bummer. Can you give me the run down so I can forward the information to him?

I'm not a proponent of altcoins. I fully believe in Bitcoin as the defacto currency. It was just part of the story. I thought it was a neat perspective on someone brand new to Bitcoin and their experience.

Are you still comfortable with this if you took that money and flushed it down the toilet?
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:51:20
Not sure I understand you on this. Not trying to troll.
Found my answer here. I'll be editing the original post and emailing the guy I met with this.

Is there a good site to sell stuff for Bitcoins? Bit'sList?

Glad I cleared it up. Trying to represent Bitcoin the best I can. :)

How do you confirm your order? They don't give any specifics on how to do that . . . 
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:39:46
Just posted 3 items myself. Hope they sell :)

You just got a new user.

Are you going to have a beta or alpha period? Handing out keys? Anything cool like that?
