That's a lot of dough.

Yeah, I could buy a $40 quadcopter off Amazon, but I'm wondering more along the lines of off the shelf parts. There's probably a more appropriate subreddit I should be asking that in though :-)

I've been considering getting into quadcopter building as a hobby.. but I'm not sure I can afford to. Say I wanted to build a small one, controllable via wifi. Something not necessarily built to last, just built to work. Any ideas on what I should expect to invest?

It makes sense to require more verification for larger purchases, but this is where it becomes important to know how difficult it'd be to fake a transaction. Could someone create an android app, for example, that would enable them to steal from this vending machine by faking purchases? I don't have a very detailed understanding of the behind-the-scenes verification stuff.

An internet-connected vending machine that lets you scan a recently generated QR code for a product, based on the current conversion rate. Payment is received, then product is dispensed.
Is this feasible?

How long does it take for the average transaction to register in the blockchain?

Should the vending machine need to wait for the transaction to be fully verified? How easy would it be to fake a transaction, assuming the machine didn't wait for verification? Can the transfer fee be slightly larger in order to speed up the process?
I ask because I don't know.
