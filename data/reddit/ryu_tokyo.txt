Dear sangoria,
How you are confused is definitely reasonable and exactly the trouble I am facing with. Please find the link below.
xpub661... is not the xpub of m/44'/0'/0'/0.
I write an example how to get extended private key and public key of your addresses in the following web tool.
1, Mnemonic is set [style veteran notable] as BIP39 style.
2,Then, BIP32 Root Key is obtained as 
 [xprv9s21ZrQH143K3tq4VBDmcidgd75CzMFHKo9Jy7VNTuUL4UCrRRVnbvsVFMiuJEYgnLX1Cf9wAUzhJFUUUQNgrt4MzFK21LD2SR8xSuFdZYX] 
3, You set derivation path as [m/44'/0'/0'/0] in BIP32 with BIP44.
4, Finally, you can get a pair of extended private key and public key 
As you can see, xpub is different from xpub661...
I think extended public key export function of Coinomi is not going along with BIP32. This is what I understand about current situations.

Would you explain about security levels of public key, pubkey one hash and pubkey double hash as wallet addresses

You mean as long as we use a new receiving address for new transaction, public key with non zero balance can not be compromised. This point makes stronger security against brut force attack?

It looks weird that the number is changing in too volatile manner. I guess the unique address should increase steadily as time goes, if they count the number of addresses with balance. 
Anyone knows how it comes?
