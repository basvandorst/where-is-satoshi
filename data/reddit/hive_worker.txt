This scares me very much.
Does this Javier fellow have an impressive technical backgroud?  It's likely Satoshi was a (group of) PhD computer scientist(s) with extensive background in crypto and networking.  I'd want to see the same for any other project I got behind.

My whole point was that the effect it had was not what i would expect. It indicates an incredibly thin market. A single trade representing 6% of daily average volume is not uncommon and can be absorbed just fine in most healthy markets.

This has been discussed to death in the past. I think the most obvious answer is that the person behind the SN alias created the alias as a portmanteau of people whos work was the foundation for what he was doing.
That would be Tatsuaki Okamoto, Satoshi Obana , and possibly someone else.
I don't think the newsweek story changes this one bit.

The problem is, as far as I can tell, it's just a vague idea without any actual implementation of specifics.  It's like someone saying "I have a great idea for a video game" but don't actually have any programming skills or background in game design.
Namely the biggest problem I can see is what will this network use for physical structure? The only response I got from the OP was using wifi on cell phones which doesn't really make much sense

@_date: 2014-03-18 14:10:41


Disagree. Well he may be a crypto genius, but bitcoin isn't proof of that. He used already existing crypto primitives in new, interesting ways. It's not hard to imagine a very creative student who took a couple crypto courses coming up with this. 
The crypto geniuses of the world are writing number theoretic proofs of security and developing new primitives. Using already existing primitives in your application in a novel way doesn't make you a crypto genius.

It could definitely be one man. The scope of what he did wasn't that broad. Given a year or two any expert programmer could code bitcoin from scratch. The hard part was coming up with the idea.   The one thing he definitely had which makes him distinct from most expert programmers, is a deep knowledge of cryptography.  I'd say it's very likely he studied cryptography at a PhD level.

Interesting general idea but i think the problem domain is far too big. I think you are tying to engineer a solution to somebody elses problem before even getting the requirements.

I've been looking for the exact specs on blocks and transactions.   Not a general overview of the topic because I already understand it.

You could also do this with a credit card and not have to wait 10 minutes for validation.  The problem is there is no easy way for the meter maid to tell if you are in violation or not. They will have to run the license plate of every single car to find out. That's why they use either a receipt on the dash or a physical meter next to the car. Furthermore, violations are a source of revenue for them and making it easier for you to avoid tickets is not in their interest.

I think the long term solution would be reputable insured banks that makes handling bitcoins close to as simple and risk free as handling dollars. We are still many years away from being there.
