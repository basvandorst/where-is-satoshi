She was under investigation for her private email servers, which is only a felony if she did something felonious on those email servers.  The investigation was into whether any information was improperly handled that could've led to a leak.  It was not into whether she had committed a felony.

I'll admit I'm not on the "Fiat is collapsing" boat but even if that were true, by the arguments I read here, the combined power of the global federal banks would allow the system to survive well after the natural collapse point.  In the long term internet currencies are a smart investment but if you can only buy something in USD you'll probably convert a tiny bit of a coin into cash, even though it's at a loss, because you wanted that hot dog and this store doesn't take btc yet (assuming someone kept all their funds in btc, idk if anyone does that yet.)
