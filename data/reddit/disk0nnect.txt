I’m gonna go ahead and guess that English isn’t the writers first language.  Reading that gave me cancer!

Scary how many ignorant people will just read that and take it for gospel, I’d rip that shit down if I was you.

I didn’t read the title, I just seen the picture.  I read the poster and I was like “yeah, that’s so cool!” 
Then I seen the headline of the poster and I was like “aww man!” 
Haven’t been so disappointed in a while...

That phone is in short supply where I’m from, sell that shit for a premium and HODL and you will have the last laugh, chin up buddy!

Dude, unless you have one already then keep it.
Fuck that girl man, just download a wallet and start accumulating btc.  Btc won’t give you no grief...

Not an expert here, but I do have my current btc holdings on the legacy ledger bitcoin wallet.  You’ll probably have to migrate your bitcoin to a segwit address on ledger, then send it to your friend.

What is your reason for thinking he/she/them/it is dead?  Is it just because they haven’t cashed out?  I’m just curious, I’ve seen a few people say the same thing.
I like to think that satoshi nakamoto is out there somewhere, basking in their own invention... quietly satisfied.  Maybe I’m being too romantic...

As far as I'm aware, capital gains tax applies here.  So you get an allowance and any more than that allowance you have to report on self assessment.  Check the HMRC website on the guidelines for capital gains tax.
