It means Redditedid just gave .one dollar to qkme_transcriber using the Reddit Bitcoin Tip Bot. Verify means we'll see a message shortly saying the transaction took place(or not)

Yeah I did some research on Android too, but a lot of reviews commented on the fact that they destroy battery life so I opted for this.
Plus, who doesn't like to waste some time on small projects like this?

Added some formatting for you:
**Why should the infrastructure of Bitcoin be based differently than the dynamically fashioned cryptocurrency itself?** 
The concept of Bitcoin should allow markets to stay ahead of rules or limitations. The trading platform itself should be p2p, open stack, scalable open source based, git script installed for anyone to develop and input ideas for maximine transparency of what any iteration is doing to tie in to friendly governed current currency exchange markets. 
Open markets has to be the order from the top to the bottom or this concept is going to be limited in its potential. Anybody who can't just jump into Bitcoin in 5 minutes with 5 dollars to make commerce happen anywhere, anyplace will take the path of least resistance opting for cash or its equivalent. 
We have to think **open**, *free*, ~~evil~~, no greed; this and only this thinking, will give this concept the best chance to change a very *fucked* up financial system. It deserves everybody understanding what money is, and that is Abstract, a means to an end, make the system pay, society doesn't have too any more! In its purest form money is the only reason we have to even have a social life once the basics of nessecities of life are met. Everything we acquire from it, is what makes us who we are as a member of the society. 
There should be a facebook of Bitcoin believers who can see where they are in relation to what they are doing with Bitcoin. Seriously, is it just me that doesn't want to see the world after 50 more years of only fiat based central banking systems, fractional reserve ponzi scheming bullshit, that mercilessly punishes the 99%ers who pass information freely over a network built to free knowledge and information! 
Wake the Fuck up already, the banks were bailed out, despite a resounding democratic cry of No! A robust cryptocurrency is long overdue and can't be worse than anything we already have but don't get caught up in how you are going to game it, cause it won't work, once liquid exchange markets are commonplace and the concept becomes mainstream!
