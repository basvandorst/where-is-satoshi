Inflation rate - 98.0% per day in mid-November 2008 or 8.97×1022% per year. The currency lost half its value every 24 hours and 42 minutes.

Would load up if I saw that much of a drop. I think true dip buyers wouldn’t let it fall that far though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:00:23
Been looking to add
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:32:08
Have you ever shorted anything before ?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:54:17
My moon is seeing the people that desire to see the technology and bitcoin crash, admit they were wrong about it.
And all those that short it or bet against it get stung, and for all hodlers to win that war.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:41:00
Same with Seeking Alpha- awful
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:06:16
Best thread I’ve read today. Hodlers will prevail !
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:53:36
They should be called stop gains 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:17
The HODLERS WILL WIN !
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:34
Chasing money - majority probably lost money on the switch 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:21:18
True, but similar themes lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:12:04
Well , it seems more of what I have been reading lately is that they are anti BTC and crypto in general. I have not read one article that is in support of BTC. They have been dead wrong every time they suggest a crash or that you should short it. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:49:56
Don’t freak out. You’ll get use to the swings 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:29:57
Weak hands will panic. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:20:07
It’s all solid stuff- I know it’s very technical. But it goes to show you the complexity and thought that went into its design. 
Read Satoshis Whitepaper in the book if you haven’t yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:19:47
Yeah - you going to HODL it ?
I almost did the same thing when LTC was on a solid uptick. Learned from those 2 trends 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:15:59
Have to give “ Mastering Bitcoin” along with the white paper to go with it
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:00:24
Just googled him - that is a grade A jabroni 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:54:46
All week
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:11:13
Same here - use Gemini much quicker 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:24:20
Hodlers will win. Many weak hands will cause it if it does drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:26
Thanks for posting that  - just sent it to a few buddies that are dealing with their first dip
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:20:09
Maybe not that particular one, but I read one about 2 weeks ago suggesting the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:11:27
No bc people want to brag about it being 20k
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:11:42
Gemini , get it together so I can buy some more
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:28:18
It’s interesting, as I keep going back and forth with it.  The way BTC has been increasing in value , I could profit by betting on BTC increasing in value. 
Timing a short is dangerous with BTC I’m my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:24:36
I have been thinking about this since it was announced. I think initially we will see some pressure from those looking to profit from the downside. But if there is anything I have learned from hodling is that downside volatility gives us more opportunity to buy on some dips.  I am going to be stockpiling some cash reserves in the event this happens. 
Weak hands and trigger fingers will help the rest of us in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:20:33
Yeah I remember that- hit a new high then dropped 20% or so . I’ll always remember my first dip 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:13:10
Well said ����
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:56:23
Feel free to short
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:54:23
Shedding the weak hands , been a while
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:06:33
Of course they’ll come out and say that shit. I would too if I felt threatened by it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:18
I’m hoping they add ripple 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:14:41
Maybe take him out to dinner or write him a hand written thank you note. It’s simple , but goes a long way.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:08:52
Into the pockets of hodlers 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:30
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:21:48
Nailed it.  I think some institutions are feeling threatened by the technology  and the impact it will have on their bottom line.
I love it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:35
So many 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:04:26
Agreed, his book is the best 10 dollars I spent this year on a book.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:29:32
You’ve already accomplished and learned more than a majority of the people just dumping their money in blindly. Keep grinding away at it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:24:28
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:20:20
Someone should compile snapshots of all the articles from the beginning of time claiming bitcoin is a bubble.  Same people that have been calling for a stock market correction since the 08’ recovery .
I sat at a table of people today who tried explaining to me that it didn’t make any sense. I told them to read the original White paper as well as Andreas Antonopoulos “Mastering Bitcoin.” As Yul Brenner once said in Cool Runnings “people are always afraid of what’s different”
@_date: 2018-09-19 09:36:02
Kit car
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:34:06
Buy some more
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:35:19
You’re also going to take a 10% penalty on taking it out of retirement money on top of the income tax hit.
Just something to be wary of.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:11:06
Of course Gemini is down when I want to buy some more 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:23
6 pm EST Sunday- I can’t help but to imagine a dip from those itching to quickly send the price spiraling. Going to look to add to positions
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:34:47
Anyone want to go for a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:31:21
You’ll get squeezed 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:02:55
What is the “ investment?”
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:50:59
Absolutely - overall I hope it betters the users , world,  and creates new opportunities.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:18:00
Seeking alpha is awful- if you would have shorted that when they suggested , you would have margin calls up to wazoo
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:46:48
Basically censoring your money . Funny part - ITS YOUR MONEY
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:30:10
A vote up since Netflix will no longer have this for me to watch
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:59
Man that was a good dip ����
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:44
Taking advantage of the weak hands my friend
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:48:12
I’m not in disagreement , I believe the future the technology and bitcoin is still bright and has a lot of upside. 
I do like having control of my assets , it’s just whether or not he wanted to pay Uncle Sam the tax and penalty on it now or not.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:22:20
There is a bitcoin trust out there - GBTC. But to do that you would have to move it out of 401k and into an IRA.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:35:02
Tell him to read the white paper and Mastering Bitcoin, and get on your level
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:05:05
Or on Wall Street 
@_date: 2019-06-15 00:20:57
I think it’s just because he comes from a more traditional generation - stubborn if you will. 
His colleagues are the same way.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:50:46
BTW, I just started digging into the Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulous. I’m about 30 pages in, and it mitigates the feeling I get when bitcoin dips. 10 bucks on amazon- great read so far.
I know most have already probably have read it already, but I’m playing catch up and in it for the long game.  More on technical side - but you’ll see the true potential and architecture behind it, it’s really a thing of beauty. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:54:51
They trusted you enough to invest their money which means they think very highly of you. Don’t blow all credibility by hiding it or lying about it. Yeah it’s a really shitty way to learn a lesson, but make it right with your family and learn from this. Learn As much as you can in the meantime and come out a better investor. You’ll get through this.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:02:51
I love when they compare this to A FLOWER PRICE RUN UP THAT HAPPENED 500 YEARS AGO.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:27:01
Yeah, I think you’re seeing a lot of scared money from those that invested based on FOMO. This is the most volatile instrument I have ever seen. So if it drops like it did, you’re going to see mass panic and pull the sell button.  I agree with most about looking for those dips.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:16:08
Yeah - I think I’m going to just add to the position. Someone brought up a good point about the Far East waking up - hopefully not to panic, and adding to their positions.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:59:15
Yeah, unfortunately had to learn this the semi hard way.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:24:29
Yeah I’ll have to agree with that. If you’re just into Bitcoin and/or Ethereum , it is the way to go.  No deposit or withdrawal fees and trades are dirt cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:35:58
I’ve looked up the price so much over the last 4 days - I have actually had dreams every night about bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:23:05
I agree , they’ll be plenty of haters out there , stay strong.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:13:32
I love reading all these posts from fellow hodlers!  I’m stuck around people ALL DAY (financial services) that HATE on this. I’m guessing it’s because they do not understand the technology behind it.  I might be a little late to the game (7600), but I’m ok with it. 
Look forward to sticking through the highs and lows with all.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:58:17
Story of my life - stay with it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:05:34
I’m attributing this dip to the Coinbase and Gemini platform being down.  I love these skeptics that are haters. I have to listen to them all day on CNBC
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:16:32
One day he’ll learn to HODL
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:06:26
I think I see more and more articles like this.  I’m also surrounded by people who basically act like this in person. Bitcoin arguments are basically up there with politics now. There are just people out there I can’t convince the future of this technology and application.
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:26:39
there’s no shortage of random dates and timelines in crypto
