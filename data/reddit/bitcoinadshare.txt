A second computer setup would indeed be great for these kind of things.
I've played a little bit with faucets myself and while I think the idea behind them could be used for other services. because the transaction fees are very low it could be used for microtransactions on user content based sites. i.e. get a small amount of bitcoins to write an article or a comment.

So, if I understand it right you are using bitcoins only as a replacement of "regular" money?

The offer is at least valid till october 31st 2013.

Thank you for the tip. I've changed the url.

And what if that 0.00003btc would be many times higher. Or if it isn't watching videos or ads, but a more fun experience? Is there a level at which you are willing to use that service?

And if a service is more engaging than just entering your bitcoin address? Wouldn't the fun part be the main reason to use the service and getting some bitcoins is only a nice addition?

Because this service only pays out once per month based on the payout of the advertising provider and bitcoin addresses are often changed, I've choosen that members give me their bitcoin address at the moment they request a payout.
Bitcoin AdShare is not intended as a regular bitcoin faucet.
I hope everything is clear now, and otherwise I'll be happy to answer any questions.
