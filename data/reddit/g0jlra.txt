Good point!
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:35:32
Nice, quick response!
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:27:06
Fallout is amazing.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:05:08
You're welcome and I completely agree!

Front page of the Finance section -- that's a different level of front page.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:36:19
I'm just generalizing but I have no statistical proof -- just guessing. I know this information is available via other sources. Didn't see anything "front page" like this, however. Plus, there's just something about being on the physical front page of a newspaper.

Umad? I'm just sharing news about the front page of an actual, physical newspaper that was printed today.
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:13:55
Another step towards adoption.

Well, I'd imagine that most people that read a physical paper are not already involved in crypto. Those that are involved in crypto probably didn't notice this in the newspaper because they don't read newspapers. I wouldn't have noticed this had I not passed by the stack as I was leaving Starbucks. Good news is, once it does start trading on Wall Street, that's probably when the newspaper audience will start to enter the market.
EDIT: In addition, if this article did actually inspire some people to get their hands on some Bitcoin, it would probably take them a day or two to get accounts set up, etc.

Try Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, or Gatehub if Coinbase doesn't work for you. I'm sure there are more.
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:23:45
This is my first comment, too. Who am I?
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:00:41
First posted this on ( ... figured since it was about BTC I should share it here! :)
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:43:38
Bo Polny predicts somewhere around 14k this month too.
@_date: 2018-10-17 21:55:28
That's it?
@_date: 2018-10-09 18:40:46
Is it listed on coinmarketcap.com?
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:03:32
Yeah, it's just an ocean of negativity out here these days!
@_date: 2018-10-10 03:19:16
I enjoyed that read. Thanks for gathering all of that information and putting it together in one article. I'm surprised and impressed that you mentioned what Propy has been doing in California (also Vermont and Ukraine I think). Most people don't seem to notice that. But like you mentioned, there's over 200 trillion in real estate out there... Propy might be on to something big.

Uh, you'd easily surpass that just buying a new car. I'd say the majority of the population is more than 20k in debt.

Coinbase and Binance.
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:29:16
Is it really the best, though? Seems like miners have too much power.
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:42:56
How is it the only one?
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:41:09
What a terrible title. You might as well have labeled it "ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN!"
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:38:11
Thanks for finding that! :)
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:52:32
Yeah, far from the world's first BTC ATM.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:54:33
Yep... And there's more money today than there was then.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:09:33
Thanks! I'll give that to my kid :)
