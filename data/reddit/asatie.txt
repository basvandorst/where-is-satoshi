This story is believable.

You are right, most people won't admit it but it is pretty shitty at the moment. Slow and high transaction fees.
The question you have to ask yourself is whether you think the upcoming changes will solve these problems and if it does how valuable are those changes.

I've been looking into BCH and the lightning network recently and to be honest it's pretty confusing. There is a lot of bias which makes it difficult to discern the facts.
I think I understand what BCH did - they made the blocks bigger so that more transactions can occur at a lower computational cost as the main bulk of computation occurs trying to solve the algorithm that creates a new block.
For the lightning network, I'm a bit more uncertain. Am I correct in thinking that this is a network that sits on top of BTC that groups together transactions, meaning that you only have to pay fees once?
If this is the case, is this network governed by the same principles as Bitcoin i.e it is distributed across lots of peoples computers and is not centrally owned by anyone?

Going to give this some more thought. I thought my response made sense but now looking at it I've basically said the same things twice!
Thank you for your detailed response.

You've been much more articulate than I could have been!
Another point that I have been thinking about is how futures have provided Bitcoin with another vital component of what makes up a currency - an interest rate. As futures guarantee the value of the coin in the future you can actually extrapolate a short-term rate by taking the price today and the price promised by the market in the future. 
This is important because it helps Bitcoin to be compared to other investment vehicles and if appropriate, included in investment portfolios. The ability to compare is effectively reducing the risk of Bitcoin and actually, if the risk goes down then investment managers are less likely to see it as an extreme 'alternative' element of their portfolio. They will, therefore, be more willing to hold more of it.
I think there is still a long way to go and I might be getting a bit ahead of myself but basically, financial instruments increase confidence, provide comparability and will, therefore, encourage the use and holding of Bitcoin.

Working as intended?

If other altcoins are more profitable to mine than bitcoin the price to transfer bitcoin will increase. How profitable something depends on the value of the coin. As the value of Bitcoin cash went up more of the mining network mined that (as it was more profitable) so they charged you more for your transaction.
...I think

Bitcoin fees are high, therefore this is passed on to you if you take your money out, if you want to use it it's best only to use it for high-value transactions otherwise you will be paying a fee a high percentage of what you want to transfer.

This post is stupid. It's not all or nothing. It's get in at X price that is appropriate for each individual and leave at Y price that is appropriate to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Trying to frame this as anything more than that is absurd. There are very real (and obvious) reasons why you would want to sell. This is particularly the case if you are speculating on something that you know very little about.

I think it's more likely that people are just switching coins that it being an "attack". I find the terminology being used really interesting, it says a lot about how emotionally invested people are.
