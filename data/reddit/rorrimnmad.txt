Oh yeah?  Cool site, then!
Thanks for the info, I didn't know currencies weren't region restricted.
I'll be using your site a lot in the future, then!
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:36:26
Yeah, I saw that site, but it appears to only be US gift cards
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:48:18
nice find
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:05:40
Huh?  How?
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:57:19
Hey, I'm just leaving a message in case anyone else comes across this thread.
I just used your service, and it worked great!  Will 100% revisit!
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:49:03
I might have to go with this...
Now to find Russian online gift card shops....

OP, you will get a much more receptive audience over at @_date: 2014-09-23 13:48:04
I'm pretty sure the answer to questions like this will completely determine the future of bitcoin

Can someone ELI5 how this is possible?  I assume no one knows the exact way the attack happened, but is there an ELI5 version on how they generally occur and what is going on (ex. why does it take 8 hours to trickle out the coins)
Also, what's the deal with 'cold wallets'?
@_date: 2015-05-22 15:36:19
OK this makes sense to me.
Then what's the purpose of OP pointing out cold wallets that belong to bitfinex?  Just to point out that *at least* that many coins are safe?
@_date: 2015-07-13 05:41:30
How does this work when the user accesses from a new device?
@_date: 2015-07-13 05:06:18


Is there an ELI5 on how bitcoin could be used to issue and trade stock?  (ex. company XYZ) Would the basic concept be like an new altcoin (XYZ-coin) and 1 coin = 1 share or something?  Is there any actual work done on this, or is it purely hypothetical? 
@_date: 2016-02-22 06:43:15
Serious question:  what does a bitcoin broker do?  Can't people just use an online exchange?  How do you make money?
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:06:42
cool! thanks
@_date: 2015-04-15 08:21:25
Does anyone know how charities need to report bitcoin donations?
@_date: 2015-09-06 08:48:32
Well, during development, the business generates $0 / month, and since this is sort of a hobby/side project for me, it doesn't have a strict timeline to deliver  (i.e. could be in "development" limbo for a long time)
@_date: 2015-10-17 06:43:45


Can you ELI5?

What's the point of apps like Abra?  I keep seeing these 'send money to anyone! anywhere!' apps, but aren't they all the same?  seems like they don't bring anything new, yet keep popping up claiming to be the first
@_date: 2015-10-19 10:45:21
Yeah I suddenly understood after the other guy's explanation.  Somehow that message wasn't getting into my head before.  It's a super cool idea.
Must be a tax nightmare for them, though.  I would imagine that's what they are spending most of their time navigating
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:48:08
I got you cause I'm in the same sitch 
Btcc.com will let you register
Register as a Chinese account if you want to deposit from within China (you do)
They're chat support is very helpful and speaks English 
You're gonna need photo of you and passport, visa copy, entrance stamp copy, and two documents proving your address. Taobao receipts count if you don't get bills in your name
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:26:53
not kidding.  it was a sincere question.  I must be missing something (which is why I asked)
@_date: 2015-10-17 07:09:19
This is definitely your 'lucky 10,000' moment
