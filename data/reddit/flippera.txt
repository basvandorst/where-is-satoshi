Oh god f*ck off with those maths already... People who own mining farms are billionaires that don't need your pennies to pay for electricity. And if you think home-miners that pay $200-300 for bills will actually damage bitcoin's price, think again. But whatever, keep thinking that Jihan Wu with his billion dollar industry is sitting at home now and thinking how the hell he's gonna pay a $50k bill. Oh ye, he'll probably have to sell some bitcoins, because he has no real money u know.

Absolutely agree. That's what gives me hope.

Thought it might cheer you up a little bit that Bitcoin is gaining popularity all over the world even in bear market.

I'm just saying that if you're into fancy-shmancy cars, expensive electronics and clothes, you're most likely not Warren Buffet :) So the money won't stay with you for long time.
