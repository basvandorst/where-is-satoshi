It's like this one time I went to the bank to **OWN** a couple hookers and some cocaine. Source:


The money I promised the bank is completely separate. I can either pay it from my cocaine profits or by saving up hookers but in any case, the hookers and blow are mine now. The bank doesn't want it. They wanted out, remember?


So I didn't *borrow* the whores. They're mine. I just owe the bank some money because I promised to pay it but I never *borrowed* that money because the bank never wanted to buy any hookers. The money isn't there anymore. I have to come up with it and when I do, I'll still have the hookers. Since I never received the money and bought hookers instead, I don't have to give back the money. So I never borrowed anything.
I can see how you would interpret it that way, but no "rule" has been broken.

He won't get that $3500 back for a year, so either way, pretty poor investment. If he would've stuck it in a 401k, he probably could've made a couple hundred bucks. Instead, he'll lose about 3% due to inflation.

It's going to hit $15k soon. $15k. Wall Street is going to make a massive profit by shorting it once futures are released. Anybody with eyes can see it coming. Trees don't grow to the fucking moon, guy. Sorry to burst your bubble, but Wall Street isn't.
To answer OP's question, my strategy has always been pretty straightforward: Invest as much as I'm willing to lose, hodl until it doubles, withdraw the principal, and remain exposed for free.
We're in for some volatile times, and I genuinely believe in the future of this tech. I just don't believe that it will replace fiat (just like how email didn't completely replace paper mail). 
I'm prepared to sit around, watch what happens, and buy some more if it drops by 70%.

I guess he thinks his Ukrainian janitor is too poor to afford college, maybe. You really don't know anything about a person's financial standing just by looking at them, though. Having a job in college, even as a janitor, puts you ahead of the average.
And then factor in that he's Ukrainian, so if he's crafty he could definitely win some scholarships with a rags-to-riches story.
Personally I realized that college was a bubble when one of my coworkers, a shopping addict, maxed out and defaulted on her private loans (which, surprise, she wasn't using for college) while still a junior.

NOW, when AA admits to his own financial insecurity and calls for the community to help, when Roger Ver publicly attacks AA and calls him out BY NAME for being poor -- NOW is when you guys decide to "curb the mob mentality."
"Just this once."

Or borrow at 2% invest in something that makes 4% and bang, sell in a down market and lose money that you didn't actually have.

No, it's not. I don't daytrade. It's not about that at all. It's about the extra 1% that has no bearing over the actual value of bitcoin and, as Coinbase says, is not part of a transaction fee.

Coinbase is getting ~100k new users a day. They are the main way new investors buy BTC. On top of the frozen accounts and lack of customer support, they're ~~scamming~~ people who buy in small amounts (i.e. all college students).
Use GDAX. I've recommended Coinbase in the past, and I regret it. They're just a bank in disguise.
Edit: GDAX is Coinbase. Didn't know that. I don't know what to recommend, in that case. I just wanted to shed some light on something I thought was shady. People don't like the word "scam" in this case, either. Still shady and Coinbase is using a currency spread that doesn't apply to crypto to net themselves an extra $100k/day minimum, but it's still legit.

It's not about the fees, it's about the lack of disclosure between buying/selling. Does everyone really think that's acceptable? I don't care if it's 1%. Tell me upfront and I'll pay it. It's like seeing a box of cereal on sale for $1.99, walking it to the counter, and finding out it's now $2.50 (or $2.03, in this case). It's not about the money, it's about the dishonesty.
And that's not to mention Coinbase's extensive history with frozen accounts, awful (or no) customer support, and misplaced funds. It doesn't sit well with me.

You can buy BTC with Coinbase but you'll want to transfer the keys to a hardware wallet (like Trezor) if you really want to "own" it. Otherwise, Coinbase technically "owns" your BTC. If they collapse (and have insolvency issues), you would lose everything. I kind of doubt that would happen anytime soon, though.
There are other reasons to not use Coinbase, but if you're looking for something simple, it's not that bad.

What do you think happened to Yahoo search when Google's algorithm proved to be better? What do you think happened to Archie and AskJeeves?
Google wasn't the first, but it was the best. And, even now, with 75% of total search volume, it could still be dethroned. That's how the free market works.
To answer your questions, I don't think Bitcoin will ever make the same privacy guarantees as Monero, because that would only bolster its reputation as a money laundering service (and likely make it illegal in many countries). And as for ether, just like Mike Novogratz, I think the growing supply will make it more viable for public use, and I like that they're ahead of the game when it comes to developing smart contracts. Sometimes that's the edge you need (look at NVIDIA right now, poised for massive expansion because they didn't rely solely on Moore's Law).
But I don't pretend to know the future. Anything could happen. 
But there will always be major competitors in every industry. Always.

Even Mike Novogratz has said, "Trees don't grow to the sky." That's totally fair. It doesn't really mean that BTC won't be valuable in the future, it means that the trend isn't always up. Amazon had five 70% corrections on its way to $900.

But unless that has to do with BTC in some way, he's trying to derail the conversation just to poke a hole in an easily understandable analogy that we've now taken WAY too far.

Trees don't grow to the sky. Bitcoin will have more major corrections, and it *might* end up going back down to single digits one day. Who knows? We might all die from a massive nuclear disaster or superbacteria.
The best investment you can make is in yourself. And, no matter what anyone says, given a long enough timeline, your investment decisions will eventually normalize at market level. You'll be up one day and down the next, so if you're only buying bitcoin because you want to significantly outperform the broader market, you're doing it wrong.

I think bitcoin's a bubble. Every life-changing technology has had a corresponding bubble. Hopefully there will be multiple bitcoin bubbles in the coming years.
Too many people are looking at bitcoin right now only as a way to get rich quick, not as a disruptor of the financial industry. People want BTC to make more USD, not to spend BTC. That's the problem right now, but I think that will change as time goes on.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:30:03
You turn it into USD and buy somewhere else, lol. Coinbase owns your keys and, as far as I know, they removed the "Send" button that allowed you to transfer them to a wallet.

Update: Coinbase uses their GDAX platform to determine the price of BTC when buying/selling, and a spread of up to 50 basis points, except when GDAX is down. In that case, they can charge more than 50 basis points. It's just another hidden fee that I think is unfair and completely avoidable if you go directly through another exchange.
Coinbase shouldn't be acting like a bank. They shouldn't be charging foreign currency exchange rates for a digital currency that was designed to avoid those fees. That's the whole point!
I get that Coinbase is easy, though. And people here really like their brand. I respect that.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:32:27
but GDAX isn't Coinbase, right?
Edit: You live, you learn. I didn't know that GDAX is just a spin-off of Coinbase. Seriously had no idea. If you guys don't recommend GDAX or Coinbase, do you buy exclusively through LocalBitcoins or another exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:04:26
You're not thinking enough about this, little buddy. 1% is a metric fuckton. Let's say a million people are buying/selling $10 worth of bitcoin every day (not day traders, normal people looking to cash in/out in small amounts) through Coinbase. So Coinbase is moving $10 million daily, and skimming an extra 2% by marking up when people buy and marking down when people sell. That's the differential between 1% and -1%.
That's an extra $200,000 going in Coinbase's fat pockets that they don't tell you about. Every day. They can then take that $200k and buy more BTC. Think about how much that's worth for a second. $200k of BTC every day.

I know what dollar-cost averaging is, and I think it's a great way to approach a market as volatile as this. 
But that's not the argument here. My recommendation was the same as u/Gett_Got's: Wait after the fork to buy in, which is technically "timing the market." You called it bad advice; it was not. Even if the first payment is $1k out of a total of $20k that he plans to invest over the next twenty weeks, he saved 5% ($50) on that first payment, which saves him a few rounds of fees.
I know that most day traders lose money, but those studies are done on the stock market as a whole, not on a relatively miniscule section of the fintech industry in its infancy. Almost invariably there's a drop after a fork, because forks are still irregular.
We're not pretending to see the future (I buy and hodl), but betting that there was going to be a drop after the fork was a logical, well-informed decision, and you poked fun at him for misspelling "guarantee," like he was a naive, brain-dead neanderthal.
Btw, if there are actual studies on cryptocurrency day traders, I'd love to read them (100% srs).

Student loan debt is an eerie reflection of the housing bubble: people with dubious credit histories (or no credit history), borrowing thousands and thousands of dollars.
When one of my coworkers told me that private loan companies would no longer lend her money (her total debt exceeding $100k+) and she was working for minimum wage, it dawned on me that she's no different from the stripper with six houses and a condo.

Guy. I never said DCA is bad. I recommended it. I think it's great.
I'm not a day-trader. I don't pretend to be a genius. I can't tell you what BTC is going to be next week. We're not riding a $2k rally and a contentious fork. We probably never will again. 
Smooth seas don't make skilled sailors, I know. The money in my 401k will always greatly outsize the money I put in crypto, unless we land on the moon one day.
But this time you were wrong, and you were a jackass about it. We have the data now. The price fell. Maybe it's a lucky guess on our part that BTC fell directly following the fork, who knows?
But this time you gave bad advice because you DID cause a loss. Bad advice because the statistics are clear now. Bad advice, no matter how badly you want it to be good advice.

Again, agree to disgree. My data is literally right in front of you. I thought it would drop, it dropped. You can call it luck, but I think it's FUD. There wasn't a $2k rally before XT, was there?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:08:50
I get the feeling you're not reading my responses, and I'm beginning to feel like you're trolling me. I said, time and time again, "No one can predict the market, except maybe after a rally of $2k topped by a fork."
It would've been the worst possible time to buy in. We can see that now.

20-30 years your best bet is putting it in your 401k.
Also keep in mind you're asking r/bitcoin if you should buy bitcoin. Don't ask a barber if you need a haircut. Just being honest, and I fucking love bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:59:26
Yeah, sure. We can "agree to disagree" all day, I guess. You're turning this into, "This guy thinks DCA is stupid." And it was never about that. 
The fact of the matter is that we gave demonstrably good advice. Since we've had this conversation, it's dropped another 2% to ~$5.4k.
You're looking at the day-to-day and saying, "No one can predict the market."
I'm looking at the day-to-day and saying, "No one can predict the market, except maybe after a rally of $2k topped by a fork."
If there's any time to make a prediction, it's then.

You realize I'm mostly agreeing with you, right? 
Production and consumption are all a matter of perception. Anyone can save; the difference is how much. And how are you supposed to start a business without any capital? How do people buy your goods without any money?
The government will continue to print money at ever-increasing rates, and people will continue to spend money at ever-increasing rates, but just because you can hold on to an asset that increases in value doesn't mean you stop going to the grocery store.

I love it when r/bitcoin downvotes a good question for no reason. (And if anyone says, "Well, the answer's SOMEWHERE out there on the internet, he should just search," that's true for every question ever asked, and it's certainly true for every pump-up post we have here). 
It's unlikely for bitcoin to "tank" just because people are losing their keys. First, if you're investing a significant chunk of your portfolio in bitcoin, you better be damn sure you know how to protect your investment. People putting $100k-$1m into bitcoin, in other words, have full ownership of their money. They aren't losing it except in fraud cases (Mt. Gox). The occasional case of someone losing $1000-$10k worth of bitcoin isn't going to detract from its value, because, like gold, bitcoin's value is based on scarcity.
As an investment, bitcoin holds strong for that exact reason. People losing bitcoins actually makes the total supply even more scarce, increasing the value of every individual unit of currency.
Right now, I don't think anyone doubts that bitcoin COULD potentially hit $20k in the next few years. Even Jamie Dimon said it. But one (completely legitimate) fear is that people are going to be unwilling to spend their bitcoin because the value is constantly increasing. You can see this in tens of comments when anyone buys something with bitcoin (say a cup of coffee) and someone responds, "$1000 cup of coffee in five years, LOLOL. Idiot."
Even though it's pessimistic, it's good to keep in mind that, in order to embrace bitcoin as the principal currency in most Western countries, we need a huge shift in the collective consumers' mindset. People expect currency to lose value over time, so they're willing to spend more now.

What? Everything is results-oriented. That's the whole point. If, in 200 years, cryptocurrency investments prove to be more stable than the S&amp;P 500, what then? (Not saying this is remotely viable, but I'm proving a point). They become the "smart" investment.
Whether or not an investment is "wise and calculated" depends entirely on its outcome and your risk tolerance, especially with the markets as random and volatile as they are. The only thing that's changing in your view is the timeline. While any expertise in the financial sector could be considered a gambler's fallacy, betting on companies that you think will continue to succeed (Facebook, Google, Walmart) are GOOD bets, just like betting on a technology that you think will succeed is a good bet.
Note: Diversification is the key to wealth creation, but you don't know if OP wants to get rich or if he's just in it for the ride. Feel free to keep dishing out life advice on the internet, though. That ends well.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:04:58
I'm going to respectfully disagree. Not because refusing to spend bitcoin destroys its purpose as a currency (hodling increases value, of course), but because the adoption of crypto in tourist locations could largely eliminate hidden transaction fees. 
The 2-3% transfer fee that most exchanges demand is nothing in comparison.
If you're going to go on a trip, this might be the move. Lol, get it?
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:22:30
Yep. Pretty soon 1 BTC will out of the average American's reach (if it isn't already). We're going to have to start framing Bitcoin in satoshis and millibits. Especially because it boosts the popularity of cheaper altcoins if we don't. People like owning at least one of something, not 0.1. It's semantic, but extremely important from a marketing standpoint.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:41:15
4 days ago it was at $6100 and now it's at $5500. Predicting the market's going to fall after a fork isn't "bad advice." Forks still cause a good deal of uncertainty, and there's plenty of new investors who don't know what they're doing.
For anyone ITT still reading, set up that recurring payment now.

I actually have a goal to make $1m by 30 (8 years in my case), but not entirely off of BTC. If I were to give advice, though, I'd follow the guide at [Early Retirement Extreme]( The writing isn't pristine but the main lessons are these:
Live close to work so you can walk there. Ruthlessly cut all expenses, phone bill included. You need to be saving at least $500/month after your 401k contributions (which you should ALWAYS contribute to get the full match), even if you're only working on minimum wage. That means you're living off of no more than $2-3/day.
I'm guessing that in a few years, after one more boom up to $8-10k and a correction, BTC will go up to $20k. At that point, you could theoretically have put about $24k in BTC, probably putting your total investment at around $100k. It's not as optimistic as a million, but it's nice. And you'll have a good 401k.

Deflation is terrible for an economy built on consumption, but it's definitely a good thing for savers, which is why having a global option to opt out of that system is such a great thing.
Fiat and Bitcoin will coexist. Email is undoubtedly superior to paper mail in every way, but paper mail still serves a purpose; online magazines are superior to paper magazines, but paper magazines still serve a purpose. And on and on and on. 
Remember: Some people still choose to live in castles.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:10:00
Agree to disagree, then. The data's there now: we said it would drop after the fork, it dropped after the fork.
You're right, in a way. But when we talk about bitcoin, we're not looking at the overall "market." The NYSE alone has a market cap of ~$20 trillion. It's an extremely complicated system. The only people making money day trading have the advantage of expensive technical analysis and cutting-edge AI. And even they fuck up.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a market cap of $100 billion, or $0.1 trillion. It's not the same. It's like you're saying the E. Coli and norovirus scares didn't cause Chipotle's stock to drop (market cap $8 billion, btw); randomness did. Or the China ban didn't affect bitcoin's prices; randomness did. In other words, fluctuating supply and demand don't affect the value of stocks; that's just randomness.
And I'm saying fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) has/have a proven track record of causing prices to plummet, and a contentious hard fork after a $2k rally is sure to cause some FUD.
It's up to you whether or not I got lucky. The reality's the same for me.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:42:59
Good stuff, my man. If you would've followed the advice of most people ITT, you'd be down $500.
The lesson: Just be a little patient and buy after the fork.

Yeah, most people would agree that gold is still more valuable than bitcoin, by a significant margin. Gold has been a reliable asset for thousands and thousands of years. It's a little hard to compete with. The USD? That doesn't mean much. Gold, though? I'd hold on to that.

Frankly, r/bitcoinbeginners blows. There just aren't enough users, and you're not even allowed to post links. I wrote a quick guide to buying bitcoin (through a few different exchanges), because it would answer 75% of the questions on that sub. Then I realized I couldn't even post it.

I'm done. I don't care. I said the price would fall. The price fell. I bought. But somehow I'm still wrong.
How many times did BTC fork after a $2k rally in under two weeks? Where's YOUR data? Has BTC ever gotten this much media coverage? Google Trends says it's more popular than ever before.  
New investors heard about the fork, got confused, and started panic selling. Or there was just a slight correction. Or Mr. (Crypto) Market forgot to take his Xanax. Maybe that's a hunch. It was the right hunch.
Fuck.
