It was an analogy not an analysis of Mt Gox - in retrospect, if you look at the "facts" surrounding the Mt Gox scenario, you could frame it alongside other Ponzi schemes irrespective of the intent behind the exchange, the reality is that they acted as principal to the parties in the exchange not as facilitator - and failed.

"nothing even remotely close to a ponzi scheme" is as much as an overstatement as the, at worst, loose analogy employed by the speaker in this hearing. The principal is, in my opinion, comparable:
**1) promising a service**: in this case, the service of holding depositor funds in trust while that depositor trades on an exchange until the point at which a depositor wishes to withdraw funds - remembering here the perceived ability to withdraw funds is fundamental to the service offering.
**2) the trustee's inability to deliver said service**: the trustee's subsequent failure to process withdrawal of funds to existing depositors while accepting funds from new depositors until such a time that the trustee revealed they did not have the ability to service all withdrawals (i.e.: they did not have the funds in trust to match the deposits)
In the lead up to the declaration of bankruptcy, they were using new deposits to service withdrawals. This mechanism is analogous to the mechanism used to defraud people in a ponzi scheme. The cause (off-chain storage) is by the by, and the "lure" (i.e.: the promise of a return vs the promise of a future withdrawal) is interchangeable with that of the Ponzi scheme you describe above.
Also, the context matters. I still maintain the validity of the analogy by the "expert" as an informative tool to help explain the chief flaw in the Mt Gox failure. Namely: that Mt Gox had less actual deposits available than those believed to be held in trust by depositors. The senators would be less informed if the witness tried to explain the problematic use of off-chain storage don't you think?

I'm not wanting it to be a Ponzi scheme, I've never argued that it was. I have continually stated that it was a useful and comparable tool to quickly explain what happened to Mt Gox to a bunch of non-technical bureaucrats.
Stretching definitions is what "comparable" means... (dictionary definition of comparable [here](
Sorry that was smarmy, but to be more specific about the logic behind the comparison: you suggest Mt Gox was negligent (i.e.: that there was theft), that is not an accurate depiction of what happened. It is well known that Mt Gox continued to operate whilst being technically insolvent (eg.: restricting withdrawals etc). 
If you replace "negligence" with "deliberate" when it comes to describing Mt Gox's behaviour, then the malicious intent (much like that employed by the operator of a Ponzi scheme) is what is most important to convey to the panel of listeners. It's not how they got robbed, it's what they did afterwards that was the serious problem, and it is this type of behaviour - the importance of the operators credibility rather than their security credentials (every bank gets robbed) - that needs to be condemned and consumers protected from.
In the end the expert used the word "basically", which if you are a dictionary nerd means more than just comparable. But I'm Australian and I understand what he "meant" by that word - which was "it was kind of like". 
In the end, this whole problem (the problem of dodgy operators) is solved by something like
