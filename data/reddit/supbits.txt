Is Reddit still blocking this IP address?
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:44:46
Okay, that makes sense. I just need some Bitcoin examples to compare it to - can you give me some examples of people who were held accountable for stealing Bitcoin accounts so I can show them side by side?

They don't. In fact, they have quite the opposite.

Supposedly he kept lists of addresses in unencrypted plaintext. I wonder if he even has anything they'd want that they don't already have.
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:51:04
Worked for me. Thanks for the bitcoins :D
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:40:13
Still waiting on those examples. Let's make this happen!

The pitchforks are only mentioned in the document as an illustration of the corporate culture. BFL is arguing that they shouldn't be shut down, because they've changed their attitude, and the FTC included that among other examples to show they haven't.

[Let me google "fraud" for you.](




The FTC has provided evidence of each of these elements.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:33:48
To be fair, he did [confess]( already.


@_date: 2014-09-30 15:02:38
How is the customer supposed to make an informed decision to not do business with a company if the company lies about their practices?
The FTC isn't suing them because they mined with people's hardware, they're suing them because they lied about it. Your comment supports the FTC's action, whether you intended it or not.
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:50:18


@_date: 2014-09-30 14:43:27
Because: 
- When people publicly accused BFL of doing this, they denied it
- Running the miners on the test network would have allowed them to perform more rigorous tests
- Miners would be run for longer than the standard "burn-in" period if they didn't have new stock to replace them with, in order to keep their mining income flowing
- Their mining, performed with equipment already paid for by customers, accounted for 3% of the global hashing power, effectively decreasing the value of their customers' purchases

Uh... what?

It is good that Reddit is blocking your IP address.

The entire complaint is available. They did both these things, and more. Even observed him physically and matched up his forum activity with his real-world activity. He's fucked.
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:58:24
Why don't you think so? Have you read the publicly available documents filed by the FTC? Even if you haven't, it takes about five minutes to find [evidence]( just by looking around. Claims that they won't do live testing with ASICs - yet that's exactly what was found when the FTC raided. Many posts in that thread also illustrate why correct information about their testing practices is important when deciding whether to make a purchase.

I'm an experienced graphic designer and viral marketer, so I know I could pull this off - but I need to know a little bit more about how MasterCard "funds terrorism, purchases child pornography, facilitates drug transactions and money laundering anonymously with no accountability." Especially the "anonymously with no accountability" part - this is where we need to hit them!
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:15:28
They lied about the status of their product development, leading people to believe they'd be getting their hardware sooner - they clearly admit to it in the Skype logs. Totally intentional. They also [lied about their testing practices]( and their testing practices had an impact on the value of their products.
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:37:12
Don't forget to add that the customers already bought the hardware, and the orders were already late.

According to Josh himself, though, [it's not company property](

I don't see anything suspicious in that user's post history. I've reported you for spamming, but I'm guessing this isn't your first account.

Wow, rude.

The owner of the server is free to step up and make that argument. It's nobody else's job to do so.

Imagining something is illegal doesn't mean it's illegal. Haven't you heard of no-knock warrants?

Ross is free to claim a violation of privacy anytime he wants. All he has to do is admit the servers are his.

If you're not going to pay the credit card fee, who do you think is going to?

Doesn't that violate your buddy's contract with the CC companies? I'm also not seeing what the difference is between the solution you're proposing, and just buying Bitcoin yourself with the money people are already paying you.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:30:49
Wrong legally, or...?
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:51:04
What does that have to do with bitcoin

His mom said he didn't do anything, until it became strategically necessary to admit in court that he founded the Silk Road. Only then did her story change.
