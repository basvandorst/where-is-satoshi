Congrats to those who sold put options under 11k, or sold calls over 12k All the put/call options expired worthless. No records are kept so no proof of which hedge funds are manipulating. But I guarantee you its who sold the puts and calls on the futures market :D

This is Korea trying to capture income taxes, which is probably the reason for the raids. With blockchain trying to remove their reliance on exchanges by the way of atomic swaps, it will be impossible to know when anyone has traded a supported coin. Korea and all countries are trying to control something designed not to be controlled. Exchanges will slowly go under, and blockchain owners can swap without any help. But if you want to get your coins to cash, thats where the difficulty begins.

No. The one that panic sell only buy at the top

I could be wrong, but unless you know someone who will "lend" you bitcoin to short, there is not an exchange out there that will. That does not stop a hedge fund from borrowing bitcoin from whales and use the whales bitcoin to manipulate the market with sells and buys. The whale would get borrowing fees

Hedge funds... they bet on the futures market, which you are right, no delivery. However, to make sure they hit their target number, will buy and sell bitcoin to make sure their bet in the futures wins. If you have $500min-$1B, you can play too... Im sure they all organize and collude together through some Discord or WhatsApp chat to make sure they are all on the same page and they all make money

I did a bittrex withdrawl. Took 8 business days. Did a coinsquare withdrawl. Took 2 business days. Both used finconnect as their eft. Not sure what is wrong with Bittrex.
A) They are super swamped, slow at processing transfers - likely
B) Finconnect delayed sending payment - unlikely
C) Bittrex has to come up with the cash via selling bitcoin (other cx deposits) to send me mine.
D) Its a ponzi, using new incoming cash to pay for new withdrawls
Im not saying any of those are true, just possible reasons. All I know is coinsquare was 2 business days, bittrex 8.

And the winner goes to... 11k! Please collect your money and see you again next month. Total manipulation to expire bets at the most pain. I use to "play" stocks and options and max pain is almost always where the stock would close so the calls/puts would expire worthless. This is easy money for hedge funds

Y'all know bitcoin futures expiry is tomorrow. Price came down to fill the wall street pockets at 9,000-9500 bitcoin futures bets. Pretty simple to follow those through. Bet a few billion bitcoin will be at 9K when the price is 11-12k, use a few hundred million to get back down to 9000, "earn" billions more. Repeat.

Buy a mining rig and make your own coins. You own the hardware, so you have actual physical value to fall back on.
