Ok we're not on the same page - we're not even reading the same book here so I'm just gonna let you continue to believe whatever misconstrued economics you think will take bitcoin to the top.
Have a nice day.

1. Volatility has nothing to do with the deflationary model of this 'currency.'


2. You seem to think that appreciation and inflation are the same when they are actually polar opposites.


3. People don't 'spend as fast as possible to beat inflation' they invest to beat inflation, and it's been working. 


4. You're assuming widespread adoption FIRST before considering the effect of this 'currency' on consumption which is not really valid.
Well I numbered these points 1-4 but apparently the formatting decided they should all be 1's....

You know Apple isn't actually worth anything close to MSFT and GOOG combined right?

But why would you spend bitcoin on something now (to save 3% CC fees) when you know that the bitcoin will be worth more next year and you know that your paper dollars will be worth less next year?

That's quite a long time. Google and Microsoft have each nearly doubled in value since then.
