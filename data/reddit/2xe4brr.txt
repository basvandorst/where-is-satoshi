Sure it is. Every private key has a corresponding public key. Hashing that public key is how we get the address and public keys of all the participants are what are used to create multisig addresses. So just use the public key to create a multisig address:
If you don't know the public key enter the encrypted private key on the wallet details section of  enter your password when it asks you to and then it'll display all sorts of information about your private key including its compressed and uncompressed public keys.

Peter Schiff is to bitcoiners what Bill Gates was to Linux geeks. Thing is Linux geeks grew out of the Microsoft hate ages ago. It's time bitcoiners grew out of this childish stuff too. Schiff has reconciled with bitcoin. He takes it as a payment method on his online store.

India will never adopt bitcoin because the government there will not allow it. Bitcoin is a conduit for capital flight and most developing countries already have a tough time retaining enough forex to pay for their imports. Bitcoin makes capital controls impossible to enforce and that is why it is dangerous for developing countries.
China is a different because it runs a huge trade surplus and gets 100s of billions in FDI every year. It can afford to adopt a wait and see attitude towards as bitcoin.

What's missing is the government's stamp of approval. Bitcoin does not solve that. You could just as easily print an ID out or write it out using a pen and paper. Without government approval it'll be worth about as much as one embedded in the blockchain.

I can create unlimited electrum, armory, bitcoin core, blockchain.info, greenaddress.it etc. wallets for free while your free tier limits the number of wallets I can create. As I said you will eventually realize that you can't compete with free by charging people.

Coinkite is the only wallet that charges people. It's very hard to compete with free and they'll realize that eventually.

I've read that in China contracts have no value and the only thing that matters is what's said orally over dinner. This is from bloomberg.

Or they don't want to be associated with a shady guy like Ver. Remember this is the guy who vouched for the biggest scam in bitcoin history - Mt. Gox.

Yeah like 3 whole cents per person.

Create a meta faucet - a faucet listing other faucets and driving traffic to them. You get paid by the owners of those faucets to advertise their sites.

If it's a contractual dispute Ver should take it up with the legal system there. Why is he seeking justice on social media? Could it be because he doesn't have a leg to stand on?

To add to what dooglus said, salting is done to make rainbow table attacks harder. They would have to calculate a new rainbow table for every salted password - not going to happen.

What software? If you don't have the wallet file and it's not a deterministic wallet like electrum then you really are in trouble. The private keys are in the wallet file and they are what you need. You could try sending your hard drive to data recovery people but they charge 100s to 1000s of dollars for their services.

Somehow China has no shortage of FDI. Some $200 billion per annum.

Everyone knows bitcoin prices are manipulated and they always have been. But to say only Asian exchanges are doing it is racist. FYI Mt. Gox and willy bot were both found on western exchanges. Only western exchanges have been hacked until now. No reputable Chinese exchange has been hacked to date.
If only there was a KKK approved segregated internet where only your kind could operate. It would save the rest of us from having to read this xenophobic shit.

It has *not* been ignored. It has been pointed out before that a public ledger could lead to loss of fungibility. It's already happening in a sense. The last dark market robbery led to BTC-E blacklisting certain coins.

Who is the victim here? You or some other person? Usually scammers that come here make mistakes like these and get caught in their own lies.

Problem is few consumers use bitcoin. It's the biggest problem with bitcoin right now. You could sell a lot of things for bitcoin but the market is very small.
If you had a hot video to sell selling it exclusively for bitcoin would only narrow your potential customer base. It would be a terrible decision.
Right now the only people who are going to use this platform, and the similar bitimage thing, are the ones that have illegal content to sell.

The address was posted after I wrote my comment. At the time I wrote my comment I only knew what was on BC.i's blog and they down played it as a rare occurrence. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:54:28
It's not a big deal. It's only occurs in rare cases according to that blog post.

Its not unheard of for entropy pools to be depleted. That's why in systems where you need to generate a lot of random numbers you use a hardware random number generator to make sure you never run out.
It also says as much in the blog post you linked above. Why did you link to it if you don't believe anything they say? Why are using their wallet if you don't believe anything they say? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:04:38
In rare cases when the OS wouldn't provide enough entropy they had to fall back on other methods. They used to get entropy from random.org in such a scenario. But in some cases even that would fail and that is what caused this bug. So now they are no longer using random.org and instead getting what little entropy they can from the timestamp, process id and some OS interface for "UUID".
They should stop the wallet/private key creation process if they can't get enough entropy from the OS. Maybe you can contribute that patch?
