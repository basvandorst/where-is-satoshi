We are striving to solve the liquidity issue related to the cryptocurrency derivatives market. Many brokerages, especially those dealing with BTC options, have terrible liquidity because users cannot properly price these contracts. We have created a unique pricing algorithm to properly price these derivatives so that writers and buyers can trade with confidence. 
Thank you for the suggestion, Ill make a post in bitcoinmarkets as well.

We have set ourselves up to compete against the big players, such as Bitmex and Bitfinex. As you know, there are many players in the market and as we've iterated before there are more companies, which we did not list (like Bitmex + Bitfinex), some which we listed and the rest which are denoted in the phrase "among a few others." If you need any more help feel free to message us!

Great questions;
Bitfinex falls under the "a few other category."
None of the listed companies has great volume and liquidity. Look at BitMex for that.
