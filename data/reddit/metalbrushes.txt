@_date: 2018-01-24 18:11:17
Sounds like a “Tab”
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:43:48
��... The stupidest thing I have heard here yet... common, really? ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:57:28
Ha!! Thanks �� 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:08:36
Andreas changed his mind about Bitcoin �� lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:24
Yayeeeee! Go Go Go!! ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:42
Tantrum much?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:16:14
If you cannot USE it you will LOSE it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:08:16
Ok sure, of course everyone on r/Bitcoin says BTC but WHY? 
Just saying BTC defeats the “intellectual conversation” part. That was the whole purpose of this post. Let’s have a REAL CONVERSATION here and set aside our “sports team” mentality and financial biases just for a minute please.
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:44:14
lol ����������������������
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:11
I wonder why .....cough..... ��
@_date: 2018-05-31 00:12:20
hey look I just found one :/
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:38:49
Any time something goes up and someone doesn’t like it they call it a “pump”... maybe it is just natural growth in the free market. People buy what they like, it’s not a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:18:14
Ya I would actually. The people who wanted 2X...when it was cancelled they moved over to Bitcoin Cash. Not a big mystery.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:05:14
Lmao ok 
If that makes you feel better. Sure.
That’s why there has been steady growth ever since. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:19:39
Exactly lmao
Thanks, you too

So you say this isn’t for the average Joe yet... 
but the average Joe BTC supporter is being told they need to set up a Lighting Node ASAP as per this post title....
Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:03:04
It’s fake. Watch the video for the actual lecture. This post is all photoshop FUD shit post.
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:03:55
Bitcoin not Bitmain
I don’t support an over complicated solution that causes more problems. 
I like/support Bitcoin not LN
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:11:19
Blatant lies are being passed off as truth, that’s how I know I’m in the Bitcoin forum.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:08:10
Unfortunately this community does boycott everything.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:22:27
It wasn’t presented as a joke. Just look at the comments of people blindly believing that this is true. That makes it misinformation. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:57:20
Unfortunately freedom of speech isn’t allowed here so for “fear” of being banned I am better off not saying anything else.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:04:53
Fake news. All this is photoshop. Watch the actual lecture for the truth.
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:56:04
Yes actually, I did use email in the early 90s and it wasn’t anywhere near as complicated as this.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:19:35
It’s comments like this that keep this silly “Bitcoin Divorce” heated.... ��  
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:11:23
Bwahahahaha Boycott Cobra now?  Derp ��
@_date: 2018-03-17 03:21:05
There is no way that the “Average Joe” is going to be able to figure this out. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:41:40
Ummmmm photoshop much? 
If you want the truth, watch the actual lecture because this is all fake.
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:21:36
Wow that looks incredibly complicated.....
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:28:34
No. 
I am saying that all the so called “slides” in this post are fake and photoshopped. I took the time watch the actual lecture and this post is completely falsified.
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:59:26
lolz �� what a joke
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:29:56
Boycott BitPay now, right guys?   Lmao
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:41:34
It should have never been full like it was in the first place...�� 
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:36:06
Sure thing... and that’s why you commented 
“it’s also very true” 
As if that’s not misleading at all :/
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:00:27
Watch the actual lecture. Otherwise you are just contributing to lies, FUD and ignorance.
This entire post is totally fake and should be removed.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:51:21
Microsoft is Decentralized?
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:21:55
Annnnnnnd Fail... 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:15:27
Because blatant lies were being passed off as truth. Something had to be said.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:38:23
Ummmmm just so you know that last truck that went by on the top for bitcoin ca$h was a million dollar plus purchase. 
This post just proved the opposite of what you intended lmao 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:29:47
1mb sure is efficient :/ lolz
