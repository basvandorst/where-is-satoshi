But only 21 million BitCoins exist, how is the currency of the future?
How are you so sure that it will cost so much money? Why not more or less?

I thought 21 millions per person. Who sets this amount? Why can't you(plural) exceed the 21 millions? Are people really buying BCs? What's in for them? Thanks for the infos.

You mean that 9-pages(or so) thing? :D
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:35:14
Well, I guess it's worthy to invest in BitCoins.
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:21:07
I know that and that's why I can't understand it. Why would you burn your card and waste electricity of a year for 1$ ? There must be something bigger.

I know that, but I understood it wrong. I thought 21 millions by person. Sorry, my bad.
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:31:36


What else can you do then?
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:21:14
I would love to change my opinion, if it worths it.

How long does it take to get 1 BitCoin? Why does it take that amount of time to get it? How your computer EXACTLY generates the BitCoin?
Sorry if I offended any of you, I wasn't trying to. I am just trying to understand what is this all about. Thanks for your time and your reply.

I still don't understand why I have to mine.
In my work, for example, I work to produce something. What is the computer producing and for who? Or it just solves random mathematical equations/problems and give me money?
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:26:42
Well, I meant like Razer, Adobe, Microsoft, Audi, Supermarkets, Clothe stores.  Except if I have a totally wrong understand what is BitCoin.
Can you tell me what can you buy with BitCoins?

Because the author 'felt like it' ? That's not logic :D


Are designed by who? The author of altCoin? And why he put mathematical puzzles that needs a solution? What's in for him?
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:23:46
I saw a video, it says your computer solves complex mathematical problems.
**Why? For who(apparently not for me)? Who has a 'winning' behind the whole Bit/Doge/etcCoin thing?
