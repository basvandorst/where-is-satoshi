Really though, why would I ever use this on a regular basis?
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:41:20
Never too late for a tipping party!
7000 balloons for you! @_date: 2014-07-10 16:21:13
You put a lot of extra work on yourself. If your card is cancelled, you (or someone else) could not use it to make online purchases.
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:45:35
Can't BitPay redirect to a custom URL? Put in some $_GET variables in the URL (invoice  paid), pull customer information from database, and email accordingly. 
I'd make sure you couldn't send more than 1 Thank You per invoice though.
This is assuming you know PHP I guess and aren't using a CMS...
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:42:48
That's the bet!
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:43:40
Aww shit, I just realized I wasted time responding to two spam accounts.

Largest tip with ChangeTip possible is $25.... Just throwin' that out there :P
2 beehives @_date: 2014-06-06 16:26:29
Hmmm that didn't work for some reason...
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:08:41
Here's some sizing for you.
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:25:47
give this man a bit
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:45:42
Well the max tip is $25 with the bot... And most of the premade words are all under $5 or so.
You also have custom monikers that take precedence over the premade words. Normally, 1 upvote = .10c - I have it set to 1 upvote = .01c.
You just have to be careful, but it's not like a lot is at risk.

Sure! Here's 100000 balloons! @_date: 2014-04-09 15:22:36
Considering their 'office' is currently a law firm. I believe you made a terrible decision. Why don't people do any research. This was a simple Google of the address they have on their site.
Edit - 
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:04:54
The weekends always suck for trade volume so that'd be a tough bet.

Because they buy *below* the asking price. 
You don't buy 500,000 Bitcoin at the asking price of the market. If there is a sell volume of, let's say, 10,000 Bitcoin per hour at $500 each and you put in a buy order of 100,000 Bitcoin at $400 each; the market value will be driven down overall based on supply/demand.

See my other comment. uBTC and mBTC are vastly different. That's what I get for not knowing my math. Bet is for 300uBTC. Oops.
I'm not betting that amount of cash for such a long shot! This was supposed to be a fun time! Anyyyyways, sorry for the confusion!

Just so you're aware, I got a Thank You email from you before I had paid the invoice (using bitcoin).
Shouldn't the Thank You go out once the payment has been processed by BitPay and redirected to your site?

Well the balloons were a test by me for the smallest amount they would allow. I think even 100,000 balloons is only like 70 cents. Let's see...
100,000 balloons Edit, 66 cents. Close enough. It's doesn't go by a multiple of 10.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:31:48
It will make a mess and not touch any of the hardware that's 6" off the ground?
