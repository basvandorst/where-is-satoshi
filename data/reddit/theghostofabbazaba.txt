The banks didn’t hold people’s cash and default on bonds.  The stock market crashed because of the crisis.  If he has his retirement already set, don’t encourage him to spend anything more than fun money on bitcoin.  You could potentially talk him into a bagging job at Publix to make ends meet...
You can take big risks when you’re younger.  But when you’re at retirement age, it’s time to spend that money.  So keep it safe.

You still have to pay a couple hundred bucks to rescue from a shelter.

If you need to ask this question, please don’t trade crypto on a futures market.  
Instead, just buy or mine what you’d like to contribute and use it as a currency.

If you are in that tax bracket, you can damn well afford to pay that much.

Oh that msn.com...
They’re always so right about everything!
Either way, pick up the phone and talk to your mom.  Tell her you don’t want to talk to her about your finances and ask her how she is.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:48:31
Coinbase probably.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:04:54
It’s not.  
But moving retirement age plans off of bonds &amp; mutual funds is.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:36:00
It requires a ton of concentration &amp; redundancy.

Still no iPhone app though...  that’s the only reason so many of these people use Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:01:54
The only one for iPhone too.

This is also a note for ANYONE making a profit off bitcoin when they sell.
If you sell for a profit &amp; live in the US, you MUST claim the income as a capital gain on your taxes or they WILL find out and hit you with a giant penalty.
It’s just not worth it to sell for a gain &amp; try to hide your profits.  
Also, this is no different from any winnings, earnings, or gains from any other financial institution, gambling, stock sell, or pay check you would receive from an employer.

Stop using Coinbase for your wallet and you won’t have any of these problems.  Instead, use a wallet.

Move then.  Tennessee is always looking for great people.  Plus there’s water there!

Right.  Everyone wants to sell @ $8k, but where are the buyers?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:05
It happened in a matter of minutes too...
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:10:12
Give it away then.
Edit: I mean give it away to charities that will do good things with it:
Coalition for the homeless
Wounded warrior project
ANY domestic violence or no kill animal shelter near you

Lemme hold some btc?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:52
When you bought $100 @ 11k, you got a finite amount of btc back for that.  Let's say that was .0002, just for shits and giggles.
Now, when you bought $50 @ 12k, you got another finite amount of btc back for your usd.  Let's say this time it was .00003btc.  
If you sell $125 worth of your .00023btc (again, we made this number up to show you value) @ a market value of $14000 per btc, then you would be selling a portion of the btc balance that you hold.  
Now, I need Gdax for this because I'm drunk and it's easier.  For the below, I used a market value of about $15k:
Let's say your total balance of $150 worth of bitcoin is .00995841btc units.  If you were to sell $125 of that, you'd be left with .00164864 btc.

It sounds to me like you’ve encountered more problems with Coinbase than you have with bitcoin.  
Move your bits off the exchange, which is designed to exchange the currency, &amp; place them in a wallet, which is designed to store and use the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:01:33
Because most people weren’t mining?

But the fun that OP will have had by purchasing those games could have led to an increase in performance at their job, thus causing a 200% increase in productivity and an even greater increase in salary because of the over-achieving work ethic.  
So all in all, this purchase could actually net OP even MOAR money back than the 2,000,000% increase that bitcoin could possibly deliver...

If this happens again with coinbase, BTC would tank to &lt; $500 and I don't know if it would ever recover from all the "new" people putting their USD in only to lose them.

Go on...

I hope they charge sales tax still.  The quickest way to get the government on your ass is to try and avoid paying taxes.

You're not supposed to day trade crypto.  It's not a stock or a commodity.  It's a currency.  You're supposed to buy it and then use it to trade for goods and purchases.

Almost $1k for your wedding suit??  That's robbery!
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:52:27
Is there any way to move your stuff off Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:38:04
It's more like a commodity than a stock because there's no perceived value behind the company's performance.  There's also no dividends, financials to sort through, or any indication of how the company makes money.
Also, OP suggested that they just started their first full time job and have a smaller amount of "savings".  Nobody suggested OP was dumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into BTC.  If anyone had that much money, they would probably know how hard it was to get it and talk to a financial adviser before dumping it all in to a risky crypto currency that spends all day spiking and tanking on itself, much less dumping it all into one investment without diversifying.

I have zero idea what you just said...  why would I connect to a node?  Don't they do that for me?
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:21:04
So how do I move my bits off bread and into a guaranteed wallet that will give me both b2x &amp; btc after the split?
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:39:14
That's not how it works...
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:03:33
Isn't the fork supposed to create the same "coins" but Justin different blocks?  Aren't we supposed to essentially double the amount we have?
