Hey! Thanks for the kind words! I'm not technically savvy so this is my way of being a part of bitcoin. 
Yea, I've seen your videos and I'm a big fan. I'm definitely interested in collaborating. I actually partnered with friends of satoshi, that's where I have my videos. Would you be interested in joining (I think you'd be welcomed with open arms)? I could check with them if you'd like.

I believe it creates like an avatar using a hash and a payment code in the wallet. This way, it doesn't reveal your balance or tx history. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:24:38
Eric built a company that profits off of altcoins. Atomic swaps sounds like that would make his company obsolete. 
Bitcoin has more potential than it's current state. You really think that people who were forward enough to think bitcoin was the future would be so close minded to think that no other alt coin could amount to anything? The reason there are bitcoin maximalist is because bitcoin has the potential to be everything alts are and more. This isn't about the latest and shiniest toy or boy/girl band mentality. It's about the underlying features. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:28:35
bitcoin forks? 
bprivate, brhodium, bdiamond, bgold...i'm probably forgetting a ton.
Hold bitcoin, get the forked coin, convert to bitcoin. we got free money with bcash and bgold. I know there are more coming out real soon.

@_date: 2018-01-03 03:59:35
true dat. Transaction fees go to the miners. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:03:45

Bitcoin is slow to change because of its decentralization. That's a good thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:54:29
It's about the size of the transaction, not dollar amount. It could have been $1 million and still been the same fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:34:58
This is the second time I come across this. You just copy and paste this quote. 
Eric profits off alts so of course he's pro alts.

I'm calling bcash because it's a hostile attempt to confuse the public. Bcash didn't solve anything. They just steal code and ideas and complain about how bitcoin did them wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:20:55
No one uses bcash so they have tons of space. And no, I will not use a coin that's run by ver wu and 1 developer. 
Litecoin and ethereum aren't claiming to be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:05:00
...those are deep questions. 
Yes, I use bitcoin. I do think it can be an inconvenience until I learned that wallets and exchanges are not estimating fees properly. That is when I took matters into my own hands and look [here]( and [here]( to get a better idea of what fee I should pay.
I also support wallets that implement segwit. More and more wallets and exchanges are supporting segwit. Fees are going down, and we'll see the change.
Also, biggest thing that has helped me...PATIENCE. Bitcoin was not meant to overthrow throw traditional finance systems or cure cancer. It's an option to bypass the system if need be. 
Hope this helps. If not, have fun throwing your money around at the "BTC Killers".
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:18:55
I just sent $100 for $6 and got confirmed within 30 minutes using Samourai wallet.
The reason fees are high is because wallets/exchanges dont use segwit and/or don't have good fee estimation. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:13:14
What wallet you using?
I just sent about $100 for ~$6 and got confirmed within 30 minutes. Samourai wallet has awesome fee estimation. 
Wallets need better fee estimation and offer segwit. If you're not using a wallet with great fee estimation or segwit, use [this]( and/or [this](
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:01:15
Bcash actually has less syllables than bitcoin cash and bch so it's easier and faster to say bcash. It also reduces confusion because a hand full of bcash supporters are claiming it to be Bitcoin, painting the space in a negative light. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:39:09
Eric has a business that facilitates alt trading. He charges a fee. The more alts, the more trades, the more fees he gets.
I don't gamble on alts. I stick with the sure bet, mac daddy - Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:57:04
I'll make it easier. If anyone is unhappy with the current and temporary state of Bitcoin, move on. There are many that support the path that the devs are taking and see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:16:11
Who's they?

@_date: 2017-12-24 07:32:12
I agree. That's why miners shouldn't control the network, only secure it. Look at bcash. We who is really in control. 
At least with bitcoin the devs are working on and maintain decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:09:42
For anyone reading this concerned about the state of bitcoin and this sub:
There have been posts that complain about this sub turning into a meme and greed sub. That there is no more discussions about improving the technology or about uniting the community. Now, take a look at the comment I'm responding to and just think about why this sub is the way it is.
The OP (original post) is about the technology and is asking for the community to contribute testing the lighting network. If you haven't already, you should try it out and witness how amazing and real it is. You'll realize that scaling is possible and being worked on. 
This sub is filled with spammers, trolls, and lil FUDsters. It always has been. However, this space has grown and attracted a lot more people. Some new, some good, some bad, some close minded, some short sighted, etc. 
The point of my comment is to highlight the comments/posts that contribute nothing to Bitcoin's progress. Anytime you see some "alarming" or "warning" or the-sky-is-falling type content, take it with caution. This post is specifically about advancing the technology and the comment I'm responding to highjacked the top comment to sneak in a snarky, obvious remark and goes as far as to provide "proof". Nothing in his response adds anything meaningful to what the OP posted about but they felt to chime in right under the top comment.

No segwit implementation. 
Their decisions to add ads and a coin exchange before segwit. Their token sale scam. I used to love mycelium. I don't trust them anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:08
I don't mean to be rude but what gives you the right to tell the devs that are working on bitcoin what to do. Devs choose which project to work on. You or I don't pay them. I don't even think companies profiting off Bitcoin, like Coinbase or blockchain.info, pay bitcoin devs. 
I too want things to get better soon but I would rather code be tested and implemented in a safe way. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:18:19

We've been through this. Raising the blocksize will come. If you're not happy with the fees, move on. Bitcoin is evolving and it apologizes it isn't going fast enough for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:00
It's only been out 7ish years. You think that's enough time for it to have overthrown Fiat and government?
I don't think Bitcoin is supposed to replace fiat. I think it's giving us an option to opt out of the traditional financial system. Bitcoin let's us be our own bank without having to ask for permission on what we spend our money on. As far as I know, Bitcoin is kicking ass in that department. It will get better. The sense of urgency and drama is fabricated to manipulate the crowd. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:02:20
Yea. Best thing is to just do your own research and follow the technology that aligns with your beliefs, philosophy, ideals, morals, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:51:21
Bitcoin isn't a get rich scheme. Some of us are waiting to actually use it to pay utilities, taxes, food, phone bill, etc. Only a few forward thinking and opportunity taking companies accept bitcoin. I can't spend bitcoin on day to day things where I'm at and it has nothing to do with fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:08:05

Bitcoin is growing. Doesn't owe any business or user anything. If you don't like it, use another alt. Those who see the bigger picture are mainly concerned about Bitcoin's security and remaining immutable and decentralized. The currency part will come; maybe not as fast as some want but screw them. It's about long term and Bitcoin has been running securely. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:33:01
A lot seems like it's speculating on how ln will work. I can't speak on everything but individuals running a ln node cannot steal funds. Instead, they can actually lose all their funds to the person they try to screw over. 
As far as who could run a ln node and regulatory requirements, I doubt only big banks and government will run them but I don't have anything to back this up off the top of my head. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:05:09
Nah. It's both. I can pay a fee and my transaction will get through. Some just don't want to pay. It's temporary until better solutions come and more users and companies use segwit. 
Right now, all we can do is be patient.

I don't know where you got those numbers from but [this]( says otherwise.

Using a wallet that supports segwit will help right now. Also, if the companies complaining about high fees would implement segwit, that would help as well.

I'm going to where a business/technology aligns with my ideals, philosophy, ethics, etc as much as possible and not because it's the cheapest or fastest. A lot of people looking for that are part of a consumerism mentality and it's sad. 
I support quality. I stand behind the potential bitcoin has and shown. It's the most secure and I don't think twice about it not working. Fees are a complete different issue and are temporary. Don't mix the two up.

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:49:35
No one is starving. Bitcoin is not as widely adopted as you make it seem. 
If you have concerns address then to the companies that are not implementing segwit. If you don't like Bitcoin's current state, move on. No one is forcing anyone to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is evolving and will get better.

I agree too.  Bitcoin is still safe and secure and fees are high. No one is forcing anyone to buy or use bitcoin. 
If a user is so upset with Bitcoin's fees then move to an altcoin or go back to the traditional financial system. Bitcoin wasn't built so a user can gamble, buy video games online, or buy coffee. Bitcoin gives is the freedom to be our own bank - the most important part. The currency part will come but takes time. Everyone out there trying to get their Grandma to use Bitcoin needs to let the technology develop first. This is the early stages still.

You're talking about one network effect. 
Bitcoin is [more]( than what you think it is. No other alt compares when you look the bigger picture, long term potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:53:59
Computers started becoming more widely used in the late 90's early 2000's. Bitcoin has only been out since about 2009. 
From what I gather is that we've only had this much information and technology at our fingertips for about 17 years and we're hearing spam posters talking as if bitcoin is supposed to be taking over Fiat and government by now but due to high fees, it's failing at that. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:21:40
I'm not trying to manipulate you. I urge you to come to your own decisions. I also wanted to clarify that genuine Bitcoin hodlers give solid advice. 
Nothing is guaranteed. But, as long as you believe in the individuals behind a company, or technology, and inform yourself as much as you can + don't invest more than you're willing to lose, you should be golden. That's why I don't believe Bitcoin is a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:59:32
uh...I just said that no one will get pure, non-biased information here or on any other bitcoin forum.
So you treat the whitepaper like some holy scripture and satoshi is God? Since it's stated in the whitepaper, it can never ever change even if new data emerges that could make technology more efficient? Tell me what you think is the best way forward so I can avoid it.
Bitcoin's potential is amazing. If you can't see that, move on.

Minus all the time the stupid failed hard fork attempts the devs had to prepare for. Bitcoin classic, Bitcoin unlimited, etc all took time from Bitcoin. Besides, a hard fork to increase the block size would be a waste if more things could be added to it. It's super contentious as is. When a hard fork is proposed, I'm sure it'll include way better shit than just a block size increase.

The main difference is that bitcoin has been tested and is working on long-term solutions. The ideals behind Bitcoin care about decentralization. The other coins have a central point of failure - there is either a leader-type spokesperson or have a private blockchain. 
If the other coins get as much volume as Bitcoin is getting, they'll face the same issues with transaction fees. Look at the bigger picture. Transaction fees are cheaper elsewhere because they're not as popular and aren't full. Bitcoin is full and the developers working on solutions are careful with their code. That's the people you want to stand by.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:03
Bitcoin's reputation is stronger than ever. It has been working since inception.
Bitcoin might be unusable for some right now, but it's temporary. Meanwhile, bitcoin is working fine for those willing to pay the fees. Again, temporary. Scaling is going to happen. Segwit was the first stage.
Let me repeat this again since there are a lot of individuals spreading FUD....Bitcoin is scaling. High fees are temporary. Nobody wants high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:33:06
Completely agree. Everyone wants to rush Bitcoin.

Nothing this sub hasn't heard before. Fees are temporary. Segwit is already out to help relieve the mempool and if companies actually cared about user experience, they'd implement it. 
Lightning is coming but they're being extremely careful with it. We don't want a bitcoin unlimited scenario, do we?
So yes, patience is advised. Don't rush good and secure technology. If you can't wait, move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:34:25
uh...good luck with that

If devs weren't busy trying to plan for the s2x maybe they would have had it released sooner?
The companies complaining about high fees are the ones causing the problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:58
I don't get it. Scaling is addressed. Segwit was finally implemented. It could have been implemented a lot sooner of miners didn't stall. Now, it's the businesses complaining about high fees stalling. Sure, it's optional but then don't complain about fees if the businesses that are profiting off bitcoin are not implementing segwit.
Also, lightning network has been talked about for a while now. It's getting worked on and, although it's not here NOW, at least we know they are meticulous and safe. 
Bitcoin will scale. I just commented on two projects. There are more that will make it more efficient. If people posting here would take some time and look up what's in the works instead of regurgitating the FUD that is spread, we wouldn't be getting spammed with a bunch of same type of posts.

It's temporary. People need to relax. Innovation is coming. Bitcoin's long term potential is optimistic.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:04:12
Bitcoin grows as the need for financial sovereignty grows; that depends on each person. You need it, you get in. If you don't need it, you might get in for the reasons you mentioned. 
If you don't need it and don't want in then you're probably in a place where you don't need financial freedom. The important thing is that Bitcoin offers a choice. 
As far as being the best currency, there are other alt coins that are faster and cheaper. However, bitcoin is arguably the most secure. But, it comes with a price in that there is not much room for error when transacting.
Your question doesn't have a straight forward answer because using bitcoin as a currency may or may not be worth the risks that come with it.

High fees are temporary.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:21
Thanks for the warning. 
No one is forcing you to stick around. Those who stick around know what Bitcoin is. The bigger picture is freedom from the traditional financial system. The currency part will come with time. 
There are other alts out there that are faster than bitcoin. If that's all people care about, they're free to choose. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:55:20
I'm not concerned. The mempool is already clearing. Fees are temporary. Scaling is coming. I'll be patient and hodl because the technology is solid.

Fully agree
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:14:43
Halloween passed already, you could tone down the scare tactics. 
Plus, if everyone used a segwit address, mempool would reduce significantly.

You're comparing businesses profiting off Bitcoin and devs contributing open sourced code?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:48:17
There's no stable crypto. You think another alt is ready for mainstream adoption? Bcash was pumped so hard and dropped at least 20% today. Cryptocurrencies are not ready for mainstream yet. 
Bitcoin is the only one working on long term solutions. It's the only one that has been tested and been resilient.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:30:55
You've been a hodl'er for years? And now you want to spend and the fees are bothering you? 
If you feel like Bitcoin let you down, feel free to pick something else. Just don't blame the community for manipulating you. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:34:50
It's pretty much copy and paste. Just like how bitcoin dot com's wallet is copied from copay's wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:13
I agree, it is a messy period. But the companies taking up most of the blockchain are not using segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:41:34
I'm more ticked that companies aren't implementing segwit. It didn't help when bitcoin classic was going to fork. It didn't help when bitcoin unlimited was going to fork. And I bet bcash didn't help either. Devs have been distracted for years. I think they finally have time to focus. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:27:59
Yes, you'd have to migrate to a segwit address. The mempool is dropping right now so maybe it could be done when the storm has settled. 
Coinbase's incompetence is on them and for those that left their coins on their exchange. I'm sorry but Bitcoin allows an individual to be their own bank and with that comes responsibility and accountability. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:38

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:23:41
That one seems good too. I'm not sure it will cut your fees in half but you'll definitely pay less. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:39
I just came across [this](
Also, check out [MAST](
This is [interesting]( as well.
The sense of urgency and drama is just FUD. The ones spreading it are forcing bitcoin to grow up and can damage the code if rushed. Just like how Bitcoin Unlimited (Ver's previous project before Bcash) was rushed and had major bugs and resulted in a huge percentage of their nodes to be taken off the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:18:33
Fair enough. Glad to find common ground. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:47:38
If a high enough percentage of users used segwit it would help relieve the mempool. There is a solution available. It's pretty obvious the major companies are completely dragging their feet to implement it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:07:05
Good you have a long term view on bitcoin. The technology is evolving despite the constant and obvious high fees post spam.

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:13:44
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:37:05
The FUD is centered on fees. Fees are high but that's because the companies that complained about them aren't doing anything to implement the technology available to relieve the system.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:11
I gotcha. As long as educate ourselves and take advantage of the technology available to us, things will get better. It's temporary and bad actors are exploiting the fact that bitcoin is growing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:45:16
That's fair. Just don't claim nonsense and not expect people to call you out on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:31:32
Thanks for the kind words. Good luck with your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:31:47
There are many out there. Too soon to tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:33:46
It's up to the individual to do their own research. No one will get pure, non-biased information on these subs or any bitcoin forum. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:27:09
There is a lot of information on what's to come with bitcoin. You can't expect to get all the answers here. You'll just get more confused because there's a lot of spam posts from people spreading FUD. 
The high fees are temporary. Scaling is being addressed with lightning. 
You can start by educating yourself on what wallets and exchanges support segwit and technology that helps Bitcoin's ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:10:25
You don't have to know about the technicals. Just download a wallet that supports segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:44:18
K. Good luck with that coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:14:03
What are you talking about? It will not affect the base layer. Lightning is being built and pushed for the exact reason that it will not ruin the main chain. It is second layer.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:48:23
It can't keep going up forever. It goes up, then corrects. As long as the technology and principles remain, Bitcoin will grow.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:55:44
Relax. The only sense of urgency is the fabricated one meant to cause drama.
Bitcoin is evolving. If you're not happy with it's pace, move on to any of the alts of your choosing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:07:12
You're being watched as well. It really is interesting. 
A few pieces of rational advice is given by individuals actually trying to help: 1) don't invest more than you're willing to lose 2) invest according to your understanding of what your investing in. 
A lot of posts are trying to spread FUD lately. Bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency. It's still evolving. The sense of urgency and drama is all fabricated to manipulate the crowd. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:48
Let's be clear, if majority of companies and users used it, fees would be a lot lower. 
The sense of urgency and drama is old. It's simple, you don't like the pace bitcoin is evolving, move on. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:24:26
LN is optional. On-chain transactions are still possible and fees will not be as high. 
I don't see why many will opt out of using LN. It will be instant, perfect for retail purposes.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:01:49
I agree. For whatever reason there is no change happening and maybe that's fine. It feels like there's a rush for change but I think it should occur only when it occurs and not because one group is advocating for it to change. 
I upvoted your comment for staying neutral and not sounding reasonable. We need more of this to counter all the FUD and trolls in the Bitcoin community on all forums.

@_date: 2017-03-26 20:00:25
Maybe? They have every right to do what they want, right? I'm realizing that Bitcoin is truly decentralized, safe, and trustless. No change unless there is consensus. I think long term hodlers and those who believe in Bitcoin know this. It's a beautiful thing. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:38:42
Well said. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:48:55
Sure feels like it. I think the ones that understand that there is not just one side need to bring reason and rationale to those getting scared. We can control the FUD/trolls but we can offer a level headed type of comfort and support to those unfamiliar with Bitcoin's protocol. It's safe and trustless and no change proves it's not easily manipulated/swayed just because there are some loud characters. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:00:02
you used shapeshift to convert to ether? I hate that I'm thinking about converting but this community/devs/miners/etc appear to be immature/prideful/stubborn/naive and I don't have the stomach to watch it go down due to unwillingness to cooperate (both BU and Core).

@_date: 2017-03-26 18:22:09
I just think it's cool that we all have a choice to vote with whatever investment we have in Bitcoin. As long as whatever change occurs, it's done with majority consensus. If that can't be obtained, no change is fine too. I'm rooting for Bitcoin and not for any particular "side" or group. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:54:14
Completely agree
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:12:09
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:39:27
I value your opinion. But to me, Bitcoin was designed to counter the irrational characters. That way, the protocol isn't changed as easily. Big blocks. Small blocks. High fees. Lower fees. We all have different opinions. That's fine. No need to panic and let the majority consensus do it's thing. People cause FUD and drama not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:40:43
I tend to like this stalemate. It proves that Bitcoin doesn't give a rats ass what you or I want. If no consensus is reached then nothing happens. Fuck it. I trust that my bitcoin will be there. Anyone who doesn't like this boring, safe, trustless protocol then don't use it. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:36:54
This. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:31:04
I'm starting to understand. Neither side is giving an inch - which might be good. Hodler unaffected and when I do want to spend bitcoin I can do so. I don't transact too frequently but when I prefer sending a transaction to tip someone on Youtube I feel the freedom. For physical purchases I'm fine spending useless fiat. For hodling, Bitcoin for me.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:38:53
Maybe no change is fine at this point since there are various individuals voicing their opinion? I'd rather let there be a majority consensus than a forced change. Bitcoin should be difficult to change. The current scaling situation proves how strong Bitcoin is too loud characters.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:05:40
But isn't everything miners are making from rewards and transactions already pure profit for miners? They're equipment is paid off in full, quickly I'm guessing, and electricity is typically cheap for miners. If bitcoin fails, for them they'll just toss their equipment, make shit for another alt, and carry on. They're selling shovels to dig for gold. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:21:25
Exactly. It reminds me of religion and both sides think theirs is the one and only true path forward. Sad. Feels like both sides will fight til death defending their stance losing sight of actual reason and logic. I don't know what to believe anymore because I do want btc to succeed but I'm actually scared of what can happen.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:05:06
I hear that
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:33:41
I agree. I have been silent for years. I have no technical expertise to contribute and I am not about to speak out and "pick sides" or critique any of the work being done for btc because I am only a hodler and if I don't like the direction it is moving I can move out and pick something else. I'm not going to make noise based off of the direction but I have been voicing my opinion lately because I'm worried about the community/devs/miners/etc. I agree that the ones causing noise over scaling have other motives. I doubt most of them even have the knowledge to understand how btc works under the hood enough to provide an opinion about what's going on. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:44:11
I agree. Never had a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:31:52
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:11:37
If there are no options that any group is willing to compromise on then why force a change? Maybe no change is fine?


Personally, I don't mind paying whatever the fee is set on on my mycelium app. I never had a problem having it go through. I use Bitcoin to tip Youtubers and some Instragramers because this was not at all possible unless they had a system set up to accept credit card. I think this ability to tip Youtubers with bitcoin is freaking awesome! To me, the fee is much lower of a price to pay than the risk of my identity/money getting stolen by revealing all my personal information a credit payment can expose me to. So it seems like it's a user/user situation because the fees are becoming a problem to some loud vocal people. Again, I don't mind the fee and others do mind the fee.
 
I don't know what your stance is but it feels like there is this rush to scale NOW and I think this FUD and trolls are splitting the community apart. Bitcoin is the most secure crypto out there right now and it has not gone down. The weakest link is the community and there are a lot of organizations that would like to bring Bitcoin down. Maybe there is no rush? Maybe Bitcoin will continue grow/evolve slowly, stronger, trustless?
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:37:03
It seems like a great option. It also seems like there are other options. I can't speak on that but Bitcoin needs to scale because it's getting loud, fast. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:26:00
I feel like some of those concepts and ideals are being jeopardized with the transaction fees and, consequently, long transaction wait times. From strictly a hodler and user I am worried in regards to the noise and scalability gridlock. I only hope if another crypto gains mass adoption it will be able to help out those who really need it. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:25:01

You have valid concerns. It's scary that money is leaving Bitcoin. I'd rather them leave if they aren't happy than try to force change. Bitcoin is scarce. The argument people make about wanting to use it for their day to day purchases are short sighted because do you believe bitcoin is widely accepted yet? It's still new and merchants are still wrapping their head around if they've even heard about it. Bitcoin is the safest out of all cryptos. Money going into other crypto is speculating. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:40:06
No worries. I've seen his earlier videos and he's quite a character. I like his enthusiasm and passion but it's not for everyone. He's also a great listener and interviewer. 
The reason I brought his videos up is because of the level of respect he has for opposing views. He interviews Roger, Peter, Vinny, Jimmy, and then average users and he treats all with respect while they convey their point of view. He's a great moderator and helps facilitate conversation and not arguments. 
Anyhow, my efforts are geared towards helping the community stay united. We are all a part Bitcoin. It's up to those who see passed the FUD and trolls to help keep a sane and level headed community. I hope you feel the same!

@_date: 2016-06-24 14:24:24
That looks spot on. 
With choosing a wallet I think it's more of a preference. I use mycelium just because it was highly recommended. If they would have recommended another wallet i probably would have used that one. 
Edit: just want to add, think of an exchange as a bank. This means they have total control of you assets. This can be good because you don't have to worry about losing your money (ex. Losing your phone and not having backed up your wallet). However, you can still lose your money in there if they go bankrupt, get hacked, etc...

Volatility can be a good thing. It attracts big shots because they profit from volatilty. As infrastructure makes it easier for everyone to use it will eventually, hopefully, become mainstream.

But wouldn't it take some time for the difficulty to adjust? I know governments can't take down every miner but by taking down the big ones and taking into account how full the blocks are getting, would this drastically slow down the rate of transactions getting confirmed and blocks getting mined until difficulty adjusts? By the time it adjusts how much damage would be done?
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:31:08

@_date: 2016-06-29 06:41:53
Wrong. The reason I care about the block size is because i care about Bitcoin and all that it stands for. If keeping it at 1MB works for the purposes Bitcoin was designed then great. If not, those qualified should set pride aside and work together but that's obviously easier said than done. 
If we were to believe every expert then Bitcoin would have been dead years ago. 
And how convenient to pick the experts that may/may not support your stance and then undermine Gavin and Mike's experience, contributions, expertise, etc. 
My stance is for whatever helps Bitcoin's growth but when key figures start voicing their opinion something is up. Again, this is why I care - because I want Bitcoin to have ahealthy future.

So it is possible? Wars have been started when their wealth/power is at stake. 
We're talking about a future where a Btc=Btc. This is wealth distribution. But to get to this point the elite are the ones negatively affected the most and those guys will not go down without a fight/war.

Looking more and more phishy. First, mycelium tokens. Then they had ads. Now RMC?! I'm not remotely interested in that so I didn't care to google it.
If someone would be so kind as to let me know what RMC is? ...much appreciated! :D
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:13:22
I checked both on my phone and website. I still don't see it as an option under filters --&gt; more features. Maybe it's a geographical thing? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:22:20
beautiful question
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:10:38
That is what is going on with our current financial systems - a selected group of "experts" deciding how to run a financial system. Look at how that is turning out.
I hope the Bitcoin *community* figures out a way to genuinely come up with solutions to this and any issue that may come up. It's naive to think that only a select few can figure out every solution themselves.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:18:05

@_date: 2017-08-28 11:12:11

aw ):
hopefully you have a bitcoin savings fund!
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:20:36
No, I am not. Users need the nodes and miners to verify/validate data and the the miners need users to send data to compete for the reward so the amount users, nodes, and miners need to increase to sustain Bitcoin. I see your point.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:32:56
I would continue with using *value* and not *price* since it was the term that was being used earlier:


My logic is this: 2 companies may own fax machines to send each other information and be completely happy and have a functioning working network. Others wanting to join may not affect the current participants/network.
With Bitcoin, the more users, nodes, miners, developers, etc. the stronger the network. More of everything, I would argue, increases value (not price) in regards to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:47:29
Maybe the reason your banned is because all you want to be is vocal (and in a negative/condescending manner) instead of providing anything productive.
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:49:18

@_date: 2016-12-20 21:29:35
Outmatched as in knowledge or numbers? If it's in numbers then that sucks because of the hostility attached to the sentiment behind your point of view/side.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:54:07
What about to verify what the miners do? How does the network ensure miners are following the rules? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:19:50
I'm not a technical person nor am I trying to instigate anything and, with all due respect, this is somewhat of a public space. From a bystander, the way responded to a question from /veintiuno/ seemed harsh/uncalled for since made it seem that there was an open dialogue.


@_date: 2016-12-20 21:45:44
I agree.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:00:29
Doesn't it depend on the resulting chains?
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:07:43
No, I am not. Users need the nodes and miners to verify/validate data and the the miners need users to send data to compete for the reward so the amount users, nodes, and miners need to increase to sustain Bitcoin. 
Edit: "I do not" changed to "I am not"
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:05:28
A fax machine doesn't depend on a decentralized distributed consensus left ledger, though. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:45:23
I'm only stating that the example you used of the fax machine analogy isn't comparable to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:42:48
It would put things in context and would allow for others who participate a starting ground or something to go off of. To be honest, the term "reality" and "we" is vague to those who might want to participate in the dialogue. If I had something to talk about I would be wondering the same thing. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:11:58

The core project itself can't pay for developers. The developers are either 1) hired by companies and paid to contribute to the project or 2) volunteer to work on the project. 
I believe OP's sentiment is a good one and we should all show our support somehow whether it be donating, running a core node, or just learning about bitcoin to help steer others through the FUD. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:32:19


That's the problem with individuals buying into BCH. It's not just about users. You'll learn this in time. Second place was fun while it lasted, huh?
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:48:55
Bcash is leeching off Bitcoin. It's not like they started from nothing. They're opinions are kept over there because most of them are annoying punks. 
Core isn't a person. Core is a project. Many do not agree with certain developers that contribute to the core project. However, as a whole, there needs to be majority consensus amongst those who contribute to the project. Stop trying to clump independent thinkers into one like minded group.

No, we don't. The public voluntarily put their money into BTC. No one forced them to. Bitcoin is not a public service. And, if BTC fails, all else fails because all the rest have a central point of failure. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:57:33
People go there to spread FUD. They shill for anything that isn't "core". ETH, bcash, and/or whatever the flavor of the month is. Its known btc is vers sub. He promotes alts...dash, zcash, whatever makes him money. They don't value what Bitcoin stands for. Bitcoin is going through some rough times and is being rushed to grow because businesses leeching off it are greedy. No need to rush a technology like Bitcoin. Better to make sure everything is strong, secure, and grows at a steady pace instead of being shaped into something that fits into businesses' needs.

There are independent developers. Some volunteer their time and some work for various companies. There's a process in place in which proposals are put out and they choose what they want to contribute to. Changes are made with majority consensus of these independent developers. They do not decide what transactions are made. 
Majority of the best developers contribute to a project called bitcoin core. Majority of the community chooses to run their software because their interests are aligned with the community's. Two big ones are security and decentralization. Changes can take long to implement because there needs to be consensus, the way to coordinate change is increasing in difficulty and risks, and distractions with contentious forks take time away from the developers from working on the Bitcoin's technology.

I also wanted to add: when talking about how he got into Bitcoin [here]( he boasts about spreading the Bitcoin gospel by selling Bitcoin Casascius coins online around 2012 before KYC/AML regulations were set in place around 2014 (I may be off here).

Yes. Some of us aren't in a position to tell the individuals that contribute to the core project to sprinkle a pinch of block size increase by tomorrow. Those that think that the block size should have been lifted yesterday have been deceived by companies leeching off of bitcoin. Bitcoin will scale naturally; not when ver or voorhes or silbert, or companies profiting off bitcoin say so. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:56:35
Yea, Bitcoin and all other alt is doomed. What user will willingly pay for their own transactions when the merchant can absorb the fee like a sucker. And for everything else there's PayPal, venmo, etc. You're right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:15:08
Does base layer need layer 2?  No
Does layer 2 need base layer? Yes
Base layer is approached very carefully. If certain variables change it can affect a number of things that could have a negative impact on the system. 
You are right, there doesn't need to be a block size limit at all and jam every transaction on the base layer. In thinking this way you're missing the bigger picture. Bitcoin has more potential than just being used as a currency (currency is important but not limited to). The system is meant to have certain features that no other alt coin is able to match right now (not talking about transactions per second or "smart contacts").
If you fail to realize this then I urge you to think outside the box and find some influential people in the space to learn from.

Base layer needs a block size increase to support L2. It's not the same as saying base layer needs to increase to support more transactions. Base layer as is is secure and robust. Second layer solutions won't jeopardize base layer.

I don't believe the companies that are complaining about network congestion are paying those that are contributing to maintaining and developing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:19:04
Just curious... Those working on second layer solutions like lightening... They are not"core" developers, right? Or Schnorr signatures..."core" didn't come up with that, right? So no, not just "core".
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:21:25
More users or an immutable ledger? More users don't mean decentralization if the ledger is in the hands of a few. What did the core project do other than not scale fast enough for businesses owners with a sense of entitlement? They're the ones that are running the network to the ground profiting all the way. No one said bitcoin has to scale ASAP. It needs to remain secure and strong. It is. Other alts like bcash leech off of bitcoin but they haven't been tested. We'll see.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:36:12
Bitcoin is not a public utility. It is not a business. It is not a company. It is a piece of technology we have volunteered to put money into. Don't confuse that with owning a piece of a company. If you don't like what's going on with the technology, you're not obligated to stay; you are not entitled to have your demands met. No one is. That's the beauty of Bitcoin.

This is why scaling is so complex while some think it's an easy one. There are pros and cons to the solutions that are present but, like you mentioned, miner centralization is becoming, or already is, a major problem. The group that proposes a solution that helps slow centralization and spread it amongst users is the one that sounds more logical. I would not want to trust a handful of miners.

It's simple. Most of us don't understand bitcoin on a technical level. Do you trust businesses and miners or computer scientists? Personally, I trust computer scientists. Why are most devs working on a certain project?

I think I understand where you're coming from...
How can they prove that once you've once you've bought from an exchange and then immediately transferred Bitcoin out of an exchange that 1) you sold OR 2) you transferred to a cold wallet? If it's 1) then you report on that immediate transfer out of Bitcoin (which probably wouldn't amount to much capital gains. If 2), you can say it was 1) and report like previously mentioned.

Core is software. No one is forced to use it and there are other implementation we can choose to run. Majority chooses Core because it's the safe and stable. The computer scientists working for the Core project are governed by meritocracy. Anyone can join if they are good enough. People that left left due to personal reasons. Open source is free. It's open. It's available.
An establishment is not necessarily governed by meritocracy. Businesses are the establishment. An individual does not have the option to join a business. An establishment may have more legal power. They can be a monopoly. They can dictate the market. They can have more control. These are the entities trying to dictate Bitcoin's future.

If creating FUD to stay in power is the only thing that you have to deal with with 2) I'll definitely take it. What's wrong if they have control AND they are the smartest devs working on the project? Why do people want to take control away from them? Why do they have to listen to business, miners, holders? If mining on a CPU was profitable, I would start in a heart beat. I can definitely create a Bitcoin-only business. Do you think the average Joe, like myself, can contribute code? Hell no. Should I start crying about it and get my friends to take control away from those keeping me from changing Bitcoin? How about I start a business and throw a tantrum and blame devs when my business isn't as profitable anymore or if I figured out a way to make more money from Bitcoin but the devs just won't alter Bitcoin for me? That's what's going on right now.

And what are YOUR credentials and the credentials of the businesses that led you and them to conclusion, that goes against most of the Bitcoin Core project devs, that bigger blocks should be thrown in there as a viable scaling solution right now? Do you ever wonder if you are getting caught in this mess and are being misguided? The thing is, you and I are on the same boat when it comes to not understanding Bitcoin on a technical level. 
Serious question, who are you putting your faith in? Who are the devs that are going to be working on the path that "we've pursued". Would you be able to sleep at night if you chose to push out the true cryptographers (back and szabo both mentioned in the the white paper and on the same side). Seriously, the best and most passionate people are working on Bitcoin right now. Let them do their thing and enjoy this revolution. 
By the way, Changelly already implemented Segwit and state that they are standing by the Bitcoin community by not taking a stance on the SegwitX2 bull. We are the community and I will be using their service because they acknowledge us, the users.

@_date: 2017-09-30 23:24:03
I agree, it doesn't have to be that way but now I question the type of person that is using Bitcoin.
Bitcoin should be usable by anyone but if the only times we get a rush is when exchanges are open can we agree that the majority of usage is being done by speculators? Why should we listen to the individuals that are profiting from Bitcoin and not actually needing it. Those who actually need it use it as a store of value and the price they pay in fees is a lot less than what they lose due to hyperinflation of their currency. 
This is why creating a sense of urgency for raising the block size is not necessary. We are seeing more and more big money enter the space which drives up the price which draws more attention from the media. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and is becoming more legitimate the longer it survives. Why risk this momentum by causing disruption in the network? It's big money that's causing the spikes...and that's a good thing. Meanwhile, we have segwit and Schnorr is in the works. By the time mainstream adoption kicks in, Bitcoin will be better equipped to handle peer to peer transactions instead of just raising the block size every time more speculators enter the space.

Again, short term. The users that believe in Bitcoin will follow the technology, not hash power. Bitcoin is more than cheap transactions. 
Hopefully, the devs working on the Bitcoin Core project will stay. The ones that believe in the technology and decentralization will know where the revolution is. It's not in another conventional payment system where businesses dictate how it runs.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:55:04
BCH came out of nowhere. 
Segwit is supported by the majority of the Bitcoin devs because it avoided the chaos a hard fork could cause. 
Segwit + block size increase is an attempt to take control over Bitcoin. People with money got together and want to decide Bitcoin's fate. Majority, if not all, respected Bitcoin devs are opposed of this method because it's not planned out and is extremely risky. No competent dev is contributing to this version. 
BCH and segwit + block size increase supporters only care about one thing.... Raising block size. Why? They think they know what's best for Bitcoin. Their credentials? They have money, they gain to make a profit, and/or want their 15 minutes of fame. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:43:48
This whole scaling bullshit is an excuse to steer Bitcoin into the direction of businesses and miners. Why does Bitcoin have to keep with how fast businesses and miners are growing? Bitcoin needs to remain secure and decentralized before it can be used as a currency. 
Plus, it's businesses that are not implementing segwit. It's taken how long for it to get support? The mempool is low and segwit is here. Transaction fees are not that high. Besides, I doubt bitcoin as a currency is getting used as much as some people say. If they do have it they're probably holding it to as a store of wealth. Be honest, Bitcoin is growing but it isn't there yet.

I disagree. I'm completely happy knowing competent devs are working and maintaining Bitcoin. I have a sense of freedom and financial liberty. Those crying that they need it as a currency do not really need. They're just throwing a tantrum because it's cutting into their profits. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:40:29


I think the only way to be considered on the same team is to ignore those that are trying to force their own ideas on Bitcoin on to those working on maintaining it. I agree that they may be moving at a pace slower than that of what the businesses are growing at but that doesn't mean that they are slowing down the growth of Bitcoin. Is it possible that the rate at which businesses are coming/growing is too fast for Bitcoin itself to keep up with? Why does it have to happen any time soon?
I've always believed that slow and steady is key. Just recently, Andreas posted up a video that, I think, discusses why moving too fast is Bitcoin's down fall - [here]( 


The NY Agreement is definitely not something we should be bickering about then. The real Bitcoin believers are starting to get loud again like they did with UASF. There are individuals starting to make themselves heard. We wouldn't be doing this is if we wanted to hurt Bitcoin. Do you think the NY Agreement will have the same influential devs that the Bitcoin Core project has? I look up to people like Amir Taaki who put themselves on the line and stand up for what they believe in, unlike R.V. that promotes a free society, is all talk, and is leeching off of Bitcoin. People like Amir are working on spreading Bitcoin to places and people that can truly benefit from it. The latter person is promoting Bitcoin, and now an altcoin, to a first world country. 
What do you think Satoshi would have preferred? For Bitcoin to benefit those already living comfortably or those needing it as a safe haven? 
The only reason there is this "hope the community can get through this intact" mentality is because of businesses and miners. Don't be that guy that has a sense of entitlement and believes in a false narrative that "Core" is in control. The recent hard fork proves there is no one in control. The NY Agreement will prove no one is in control. The only thing that is being done is fucking up the project and proving that Bitcoin has failed by showing that those who profit from it the most can steer Bitcoin in whatever direction they want. Personally, if SegwitX2 ends up being the main chain and devs leave the Bitcoin Core project, I will join them. I will have lost faith in Bitcoin being in the hands of those wanting to create something for the people and falling into the hands of entities wanting to profit from Bitcoin and suck it dry.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:37:45
Bitcoin does not need businesses built on top of it to succeed. Bitcoin does not need the help of businesses to advance the technology. Bitcoin does not need to keep up with the pace of businesses. 
Bitcoin is for the users. We will spread Bitcoin organically and at our own pace. We will not rush it's growth. We will respect the endless possibilities it provides and allow it to evolve. 
The consensus amongst Bitcoin developers will help progress Bitcoin. They are the reason Bitcoin is secure and safe to use. They are the reason we trust Bitcoin.
Miners put their own money up to earn money. They work for Bitcoin. Miners are motivated by profit first, and indirectly secure the network. They mine whatever they can profit from. 
Businesses like exchanges act as third parties and are fortunate to be around. Businesses are not necessary for Bitcoin to survive. 
Bitcoin is surviving because of the users. It's obvious to see who the users are standing behind. Running a node is our way of voting ever since large mining farms/pools have prevented the average user from participating; an overwhelming of nodes are running Core. There are other implementations but none have the trust of the users like Core's implementation. 
We all contribute to the Bitcoin network. Know your role.

Bitcoin the concept is hard to understand. It's unlike anything we've ever had before but people are trying to compare it to a company or democracy. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:37:12
It's for everyone. But the scaling is being rushed because bitcoin as a currency is growing faster than was probably expected. Just because businesses are built on top of Bitcoin doesn't mean Bitcoin has to keep up at the same pace. What happens if Bitcoin fails because businesses and miners rushed scaling? The ones who rely on it the most lose. Businesses don't lose. Miners don't lose. They probably will end up fine because they had money to begin with (the big time miners and businesses supporting the hard fork).

I'm using an explanation from "[Blockstream was formed by core devs with specific legal clauses to allow them to act independently]( Their employment is structured such that they can not be bought out, and Bitcoin tech they develop [cannot be monopolized by any corporation]( (including themselves)."
[Blockstream employees are not the only contributors to the Bitcoin Core project.](
There is no sense of urgency. Aren't the miners the one that were blocking segwit's activation? Up until recently, miners that advocated for bigger blocks have been mining 1mb blocks and empty blocks after segwit had been activated.

No deflection. You made the assertion that it's simple. 
I can admit that I'm not technical and reserve my opinion on Bitcoin's future because of that. I don't pick sides based on what I read. The truth is, the majority of devs are working on a specific project and I can admit I place my trust in their opinion. 
My point is, if you are smart enough to look at the code and completely understand it then do something with your talent but don't expect to change anything unless there is majority consensus amongst other talented devs. If you're just on the side lines watching this all play out pretending you understand the code and voicing your opinion, please stop.

Stalemate? Between whom? The ones profiting from Bitcoin (business and miners)? The more I read about compromise the more I learn it's about business wanting a quick fix. It seems like the Bitcoin Core project is working on solutions to help users and, which may, hurt current business built on top of Bitcoin (for example - using atomic swaps instead of ShapeShift). 
Also, there are reasons to believe that fees and the mempool started to rise as a coordinated attack explained by this recent [article]( 
I'd stand behind the devs working for the Bitcoin Core project before any business(es) or miner(s) wanting to pivot Bitcoin to fit their needs. 
You are playing the role of a business. The Bitcoin Core project is for the users. It's not politics. It's about getting Bitcoin right the first time and I feel safe with how the devs working on the Bitcoin Core project are steering it. I do not have confidence in a business or miners with no technical know-how. 
You are the villain, Eric. As long as you, or anyone, represents a business and wants to implement their own ideas, for their business's sake, onto Bitcoin devs you will be seen as being biased and selfish. 
One last thing, it frustrates me that the devs are not paid by any of the businesses that are demanding Bitcoin to scale yet they want to be heard. I'm not implying that devs need to get paid to listen to business/miners. I just wanted to point that out. 
Edit: villain might be too strong of a word. My frustration is showing. I hope that other business's are as human as you are, Eric. I hope that they don't forget to step down and see things from a plain user's point of view and see that we want a store of value first. That's the only way to beat the banks and politicians. Some of us are hoping to beat inflation by storing our wealth in Bitcoin. If this happens, we won't rely on banks so much. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:38:20
You're right. And maybe you're just not as passionate about the possibilities Bitcoin may provide if it's built conservatively and for the users. Businesses and miners are the ones rushing and trying to push for progress when maybe it's not ready for the pace it's getting pushed at. 
You seem like a cool guy and have a "whatever happens attitude" but Bitcoin is about the users. We need to stand together and not stand for something if we do not completely understand the ramifications of a certain path. This is why I stand behind Bitcoin Core because I trust they're doing what they think is best to make Bitcoin for the people and not business/miners. 
"Cool story. (; (; whatever happens happens"

IMO, if this 2X thing succeeds, it will not surprise me if same people supporting 2X will fall for raising the 21mil coin cap if it's disguised as something users will benefit from.

Phone wallet (mycelium, jaxx, etc) is faster to transfer to if you don't have a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger. Paper wallet is good too if you can do it securely. 
On top of Coinbase (or any exchange) not giving you your private keys, they support the upcoming hard fork. I know you didn't ask but I think as many users need to know about how they can vote by what services they (we) use.

So, the fact that a majority of the devs working on the same open source project agree that raising the block size the way it is proposed in the NY agreement means nothing because there are a few individuals employed by Blockstream?


AB: We believe in a future where users are empowered to control their own assets. Our mission is to take the core secure P2P functionality of Bitcoin and extend it to other digital assets so that decentralized, P2P finance can come to fruition.
They also want to create [sidechains]( Sidechains introduce a way to exchange all sorts of digital assets without cluttering the blockchain. Now, help me understand where the issue is?
Also, no one is against raising the block size limit and the fact that the majority of developers are against should speak volumes. Like I mentioned earlier, just because a handful of developers feel it's "easy" doesn't mean it should be done before implementing other types of technology on top of Bitcoin. 
From my understanding, sidechains threaten certain existing businesses. It will make them obsolete or less of a key player.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:26:37
I'm a bitcoin user and I totally disagree. So when you say "we" it's probably a small loud group because most users would have been happy with status quo with or without segwit. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:36:00
I see your point. With the way things have changed with miners it's no longer one cpu one vote and it's difficult to give them that much voting power when they're using ASICs and mining pools to hide behind. It probably wouldn't be so bad if ASICs were more readily available but that's not the case right now.

A few people that contribute to the bitcoin core project control that individual project. That in itself is not Bitcoin. The users decide to run the Bitcoin Core client. That is the best metric because hashpower doesn't decide what bitcoin is. Miners get paid for the work they provide just like any other business built on the Bitcoin blockchain. Just like most businesses, they are profit driven and could give a shit about how they affect the Bitcoin network as long as they're making money. 
NYA wasn't necessary and there was nothing wrong with the status quo before segwit. Only people saying otherwise were those trying to shape bitcoin to work with their business model. Bitcoin will scale when it's ready. Unless you are personally contributing to any sort of development project the only vote you get is with your node.

But it is. Why is there a sense of urgency? My main thing is the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain. It works regardless of what others say. Sure, the fees may be higher than what they used to be but that does not mean it's broken. The fact that segwit was activated means that it's good technology and it had approval. The fact that it only got activated once it was coupled with a block size increase in an implementation spear-headed by one dev and will be maintained by ?? shows that technology and security have no place in the debate. Those advocating for the blocksize increase are misled and think "Core" is holding back progress. 
The beauty with Segwit is that no one has to use it if they do not want to. Nothing changes and no one gains more control other than users. Block size increase benefits who? If it's transactions, there are solutions getting worked on by various teams (not just "Core") that will benefit users and not businesses. 
Again, I'm putting my trust on the consensus of the majority Bitcoin devs. Just because a handful say it's fine to do something doesn't mean it should be done. I'm not saying they are not talented or competent but when a large number of Bitcoin devs are against a block size increase the way it might go down in Nov., it speaks volumes on the risk of fork.

If raising block size is so important why is AntPool constantly mining blocks ~half of 1mb. 
What happened to the tens of thousands of transactions stuck in the mempool? It's right around 20K right now. 
All the events that started the debate seem to have vanished. Why is it necessary to raise the block size right now if segwit provides enough relief once wallets and exchanges start implementing it. There are many waiting for this feature to be implemented.
Seems like the businesses and miners are still causing the issues they are trying to fix. Like I said, I'm not technically literate to give you a reason why we can't raise the block size. However, the reasons against raising it seem to hold more ground than the reasons for raising it. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:41:23
well, here's an explanation from :














Given the progress in a lot of fields most are fine with the increase segwit provides, but beyond that there's no real foundation to increase it further anytime soon.

What kind of dirty tactics you referring too?
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:00:41
Like I said, majority of the Bitcoin devs are advocating against raising the block size at this moment. 
That's why I don't give too much credit to individuals on Reddit, Twitter, etc. saying that raising the block size is "simple."
To say 1mb is crippling Bitcoin is FUD or just your personal opinion. This is where we'll agree to disagree. I'll go as far as to say Bitcoin without segwit was fine. I don't want businesses and miners manipulating the Bitcoin blockchain and fooling individuals into thinking Bitcoin needs a quick fix.

I'm sorry but I'm sick of hearing this sense of entitlement as if bitcoin must scale as soon as possible instead as scaling using the latest technology and data. Bitcoin doesn't owe us anything. We owe bitcoin our patience for coming into existence as an alternative to our current financial systems.

If possible, stay away from shapeshift only because they're supporting the 2X hard fork. There's changelly.com...works exact same way. 
Either one is easiest way to convert, though. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:25:53
It's about how it's done. Do you really think btc1 is the best way to go? BCH is a much better alternative than btc1 but even BCH has its issues. Increasing the block size is going to happen but there's no need to rush in doing so just to please businesses. Better to have a safe, tested implementation than a rushed one that might fail to keep people's trust.

I wanted to do something to help give back to the community and this is just a small token of my appreciate and gratitude for what Bitcoin has done for me. $10 covers my costs of price/frame, shipping, and a donation back to the bitcoin community. PM me to help get these off my hands.
- Bitcoin plate frames paid for with bitcoin. To my surprise, merchant offered bitcoin as a payment method! Naturally, I paid with bitcoin. 
- Bitcoin-only payments accepted. 
- Donations will be made to those who contribute to the Bitcoin community like individuals from YouTube/Steemit channels WCN, Bitcoin Meister, BTC Sessions, Friends of Satoshi, Andreas Antonopoulos, or other individuals/groups like bitcoin.org, and in helping with running a full node (plans to do this soon).
Remaining frames will be installed on family and friends' cars with, or without, their consent. (:

Andreas Antonopoulos said it best in one of his [Q&amp;A's](
"I'd rather have another five years of thoroughly being underestimated and ignored. Let's sneak up on them a bit longer."
One can argue that the community was built too fast. Even Wikileaks was asked to not accept donations via Bitcoin. Just because these businesses are here doesn't mean they are a positive influence on the community.

Mycelium said they're working on it... If another phone wallet implements it, I'm switching over. If there's already one out there, do tell (:
Edit: agree though. We should let wallets know there is a demand for segwit. If they don't support it or have no plans to implement it, then we move to another one.

I saw one written by p. Todd (not sure of that's the one you're talking about) but it goes over my head. 
I appreciate the chat and for taking the time to explain that raising the block size isn't as big of a deal as I thought it was. 
I'm glad we both agree on something - that there's no sense of urgency for raising the block size. The only thing we'll have to agree to disagree is on the when to do it (not that my opinion holds any ground compared to those who understand Bitcoin better). 
I was listening to an interview with a Core contributor and he stated something along the lines that the Core contributors are very conservative and want to make changes with the least amount of risk. In that sense, building on top of the blockchain makes sense as to not having to make changes to the main chain until necessary. This is the reason I feel confident in their decisions. 
In the end, anyone believer of Bitcoin's technology and ability to turn any individual into their own bank is on the same side. I respect your opinions as long as their genuine and truly want Bitcoin to succeed. Sorry to leave on a sappy note.

Bitcoin doesn't need businesses like Coinbase. Long-term, if the main devs remain, Bitcoin will grow in a more organic way instead. Sure, businesses are helping facilitate it's growth but that doesn't mean Bitcoin needs to keep up. Bitcoin isn't made for businesses. It's for the users. Eventually, Bitcoin will live up to everyone's potential. No need to rush.

Good question. What did they say?
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:31:54
Thanks so much for explanation.
I've downloaded both and noticed one difference, mostly the main difference, why I mostly kept using Mycelium for so long - they show the price per BTC on their homescreen. I noticed on GreenAddress the balance is shown on the bottom, which is subtle and I like that. If there's any way to show the price per BTC with the option in settings to select which fiat and exchange to calculate the price, I'll switch over. 
With mycelium's token sale and lack of support for segwit implementation, I'm ready to change to a wallet that doesn't hold alts as a priority.

No one is against raising the block size. It's the when and the how. Leave that up to those dedicated to working on bitcoin development. Unless you're contributing, sit back and don't try imposing your opinion on others. Also, there is nothing wrong with stagnation until Bitcoin is ready to scale. There is no rush.

I hear you but not all devs working on the Core project are funded by blockstream. Some work for other Bitcoin-related companies. I can provide you links if necessary (I'm on my phone right now). 
Let me add this - Bitcoin Core is a project where devs work on a specific Bitcoin client implementation. Bitcoin Core is not a company. It's a project kept alive by various smart computer scientists. They don't always agree on how to move Bitcoin forward. So, naturally, Bitcoin takes time to mature and grow because without majority consensus amongst some of the best most competent devs, there is no change. 
Personally, I'd be happy if we didn't have segwit if we could have avoided this potential hard fork. I put my trust in a group of competent respected devs and their collective decision on the best path forward. 
The ones screaming for Bitcoin to scale are businesses. They want to milk Bitcoin dry and are willing to risk it's security to make a few bucks. They are trying to deceive new users into thinking that Bitcoin is broken and it needs fixing. There is something suspicious about their intentions, especially since they have no technical background.

Thanks! I'll check it out. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:41:05
I guess we'll see. Bitcoin is supposed to be difficult to change. If a bunch of businesses can get together and change things based off what makes them the most money then bitcoin is no better than PayPal. For all we know, those businesses probably won't even be around 10-15 years from now. 
There's Bitcoin Cash already. Why have another fork? It's not about fees. It's about the brand and businesses want it for them to profit off of. 
I use bitcoin every chance I get. Whenever I see a merchant accept bitcoin, I pay using bitcoin and I don't care about the temporary inconvenient "high" fees. 
To be honest, there's not many merchants where I'm at that accept Bitcoin. Believe me though, when I can pay in Bitcoin I'm surprised at first because it's not as mainstream as the loud individuals are making it out to be. So, when I find a merchant accepts bitcoin, I gladly pay in bitcoin to support the network. High fees or not, no one is forcing anyone to use this free technology so demanding changes to lower fees is obnoxious and selfish. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:27:14
I wonder what else third parties will decide...ah, doesn't matter, right? What third parties want, third parties get!


6 devs that contribute to the Bitcoin Core project were there. "Core" is a project worked on by a group of independent individuals. 
[Hong Kong Agreement]( "If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017."
Community support - that's pretty vague. What community support? It's not specified. Maybe the group of leading Bitcoin devs did not support raising the block size at that time. Whatever the reason, it's misleading to lump all devs working together on a project and blame them for the unfortunate state of current events happening. 


@_date: 2017-10-06 00:12:50
[Check this out](
[Check this out too](
My observations - individuals that support block size increase also openly support altcoins and/or have a business that leeches off of Bitcoin's blockchain and benefit from mass adoption as soon as possible. The ones that value Bitcoin are neutral/conservative and care more about censorship resistance, decentralization, security, etc.. I can provide you specific examples if needed as I'm too lazy to provide links in this comment.
The more research you do the more you'll come across certain names and respected individuals that, in my opinion, truly understand Bitcoin on all levels and not just as a currency.

Ive only dealt with coinbase and when i first opened my account it took weeks, maybe months, to verify my identity to get instabuy and get higher buy limits. It was frustrating and i feel for everyone having issues. 
When another exchange comes out that offers better service those who are unsatisfied will be able to choose. Until then, we are stuck. 
Until there is a seamless on/off ramp to go from btc to fiat i dont buy btc unless i am wiling to hodl on. Plus, bicoin is coming along just fine and instead of trying to make a profit, im waiting until i can use it for my everyday purchases. I cant wait until customer service catches up to bitcoin services demands. Maybe there's a potential start up right there? Decentralized customer service.

I don't have an opinion about how Bitcoin progresses and evolves because I haven't contributed to anything other than hodl-ing Bitcoin. But, those that have contributed to the growth of Bitcoin via mining, exchanges, writing code, politics, accepting bitcoin, or any other way the helps Bitcoin's growth then I'd say they should definitely have some say and opinion without getting put down. Anyone else voicing their opinion as it were coming from Satoshi himself needs to sit back and let those actually doing something do work or jump shit if they don't agree with the direction Bitcoin is going.

I keep hearing others having issues with Coinbase but I have never had any major issues with them. 
When I first tried setting up my account over a year ago I did have to verify my identity like 15 times but ever since then no issues with my limits or insta buys. 
No company is perfect, though. It seems like people are quick to complain and cry foul when something doesn't go smooth. I've had more issues with my actual back used to hold my fiat than I've had with Coinbase. 
If you want things to go as smooth as possible don't try to rush anything. Take time to set everything up and give coinbase plenty of time to confirm and process your request. This is just good practice for yourself so your not stuck worrying if you submitted everything seconds before the deadline and then blaming others if it didn't go through.

After listening to Eric lambrozo talk about how much he wants what's best for bitcoin reminded me of that example of breaking a toy in half to find out what kid the toy belongs to - the kid who would rather sacrifice the toy and part with it than have it broken shows they care for it the most.

At least for Eric, he said he's completely happy with the status quo instead of something that can fork Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still freedom from institutions as status quo. 
On the other hand, the ones advocating for change to save bitcoin are willing to risk a fork in order to "fix" Bitcoin. The outcomes would be unknown. Personally, i do not want two Bitcoins. 
Not sure who is doing what behind closed doors but one thing is for sure... One protocol seems extremely rushed while the other extremely tested.
