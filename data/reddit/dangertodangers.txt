All right, this sub is fun when it has bitcoin news and roller coaster memes but I'm tired of the whole libertarian bullshit. This is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.
I'm out.

I think you should make it clear that that was for the sanctions before the nuclear deal. Your title really confused me. Right now the EU wants to maintain the deal while the US doesn't (because Trump is an idiot). The problem as the article mentioned is that with SWIFT transactions might go through US banks making things a lot more complicated.
EU is trying to make a parallel alternative for SWIFT to circumvent that issue. Crypto could also be an alternative so that's interesting.

Do you have a TREZOR promo code by any chance? Like a recruitment thinger or something?

It's very normal for stores in Paris to not accept debit or credit card. Also Germany.
It sucks and I hate it.

If I could magically add coins to my bank account I'd pick them up no matter the value. But I can't. So it's almost like picking up garbage.

No, I haven't. I lived there for 5 years but I haven't been in like... 3.
But thanks! That's great news! Having to look for ATMs and withdraw cash always pissed me off.

In France? Because it's a pain in the ass to use a card in France (and Germany). Most places only accept credit or debit after a certain amount.

That's not what the link you posted says.
And dude, those numbers aren't alarming. In Nordic countries most people are reviving some kind of social security through pension, schooling, healthcare, unemployment, family benefits, government housing or something else. Yet no one is being forced to work "gulag style".
Argentina cashed a check it couldn't afford. That happens to many countries, but you can't blame the social programs for that, as they're what often help a country succeed. You have to spend money to make money, you know?

What are you talking about? The article you linked just shows that a third of Argentinians  use some form of social security. Those are normal numbers. How the fuck did you jump from that to "being forced to work"?

Argentina isn't socialist and you can't blame its failures on socialism. If Argentina is socialist then so is most of Europe and the Nordic countries even more so. Also, look at the Nordic countries. They're among the best places to live in in the entire world.

I've been living in Finland for about 7 years. Life is honestly good here. The wages are not as high as some other places, but even the shittiest, worst paid job pays enough to live unlike America. On top of that I don't have to worry about healthcare or university costs if I were to have kids. If I were to become unemployed I also wouldn't stress either because I'd get around 75% of my current salary for a while. On top of that getting fired is almost impossible so I don't have to worry about losing my job unless the company does lay-offs (which take months to prepare) or the company goes bust. Lastly everyone gets by law about a month of paid holidays plus paternity leave is pretty lengthy.
I would say everyone is pretty much between lower to upper middle class here by American standards plus a handful of wealthy people.
It's for the most part a chill, stress-free life for the majority of people. That's why Finland has ranked happiest country in the world twice in a row despite the weather.
