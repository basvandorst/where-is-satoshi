It's impossible for us to get a US bank account. We cann't register account on coinbase.com without a US bank account.
So the only option is use bitpay, but still cann't withdraw USD from Bitpay.

In the past ten years, most of them use regnow.com to accept payments, regnow charges 20%. 
I discussed bitpay and coinbase with them, but both bitpay and coinbase.com don't accept Chinese bank account. 
So if they take bitcoin payments, they only can transfer them to CNY by themselfs.

Chinese government talked about Cancel foreign exchange control thousands of times during the last 30 years,  but nothing happend.
So, i think, there will be no any impact.

Bitcoin is the best opportunity for invest in human history, in the long term, volatile != risky, i have been invested in stock market for ten years and i sold all of my securities and apartments one year ago,  all-in for bitcoin, my average price is $800, during last 15 month, it droped from $800 to $200, i didn't sell one penny and  bought more. 
You need to understand bitcoin deeply to avoid panic when price drops dramatically.
I am moving to Chiang Mai, Thailand from Shanghai right now, and need to work hard to support my family, but i don't regret it.

Chinese here, There's nothing to do with the Great Firewall of China.
The main reason is because we don't have education system, since WWII our culture were destroyed, we have schools, but there's no real education, the only thing you do is how to pass an exam, how to cheat, there have no real teachers too , they force you to follow the rules, don't allow you to ask "why".
Because of this slavery system, we don't care anything except money, you can barely see smile on our faces, because few people are well-educated, most of us are animals, slaves.
