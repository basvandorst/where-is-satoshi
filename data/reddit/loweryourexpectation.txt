I understand that blockchain is a neutral way of determining ownership and it also eliminates the delay banks create so you know up to the minute who own what, eliminating the overdraw issue. It also means that you don't have to pay a bank for accounts or get charged over drafts because it is a community process where people are rewarded with bitcoins (through mining). 
But how exactly are blockchains created? What exactly is mining?
Thanks for your reply!

This analogy is how I picture this. It is like building a brick wall. Bricks are made up of transactions and in order for a brick to be worthy of placement it has to be made just right (the cryptographic problem has to be solved). Once the brick has been created and made to specifications it can be placed and everyone can see that that brick was made correctly because it it a public wall.
I feel like this is a bit idiotic but it is how I see this working in my head.

This is the video I watched where I kind of started hearing about blockchain technology as a replacement for custodial services in the finance world. 
This is the video I watched about bitcoin that explains blockchain. 
I think I am starting to understand a bit better.
There is a finite number of bitcoins. So what happens when there are no more bitcoins to mine? What will be the incentive to find the right solution to the cryptographic problem?
This is where I am having the problem making my mental leap. If someone is suggesting this technology can be used to manage custodial accounts what will be the motivation to solve the blockchain? I mean the incentive of bitcoin will not be there.
