It'll be great if you could try out the webapp or android app and give us some feedback. You can top up with Bitcoin and activate the agent account in the settings menu to get an idea of how the agent model works.

Thanks - that's an accurate description.
 
We’re in beta and operating only in South Africa for now. However, we allow international users to load their balances with bitcoin. We support ZAR, EUR and USD hedging. 
 
We currently do not charge transaction fees, but we do charge a hedging fee documented [here]( (We’ll update the fee description into something more concise soon!).

We're two founders from South Africa, Michail Brynard and Helghardt Avenant.  
 
ZapGo evolved from our previous project Xoin, prepaid bitcoin for Africa. Here's a link to the [blog](  
 
Currently only South African users can load their balance with a bank transfer. International users can load with bitcoin. Users operate in their local currencies, without bitcoin volatility risk. You can read more about how the hedging works [here](  
 
ZapGo is still in beta and transaction volumes are limited. ZapGo is the easiest way for people in Africa to spend their cash online.

ZapGo users operate in their local currencies, but can make payments anywhere Bitcoin is accepted. 
 
It is a centralised system like M-PESA or PayPal, but with the advantage of being able to send your money to a Bitcoin address whenever you choose. 
 
User funds are stored in bank accounts and we hedge against volatility risk buy placing market orders on bitcoin exchanges (similar to what BitPay and BitReserve do). 
 
[Here]( are some more details on how it works.
