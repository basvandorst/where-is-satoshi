this. I go for walks. Take my daughter to her activities. I check it during my "me time" at night and when I'm at work. I like to get paid to poop, too.

yep. I bought and sold btc same day yesterday through coinbase. Started and ended with ZERO balance.

I'm sort of glad that they didn't fully understand the concept. This was just enough to keep the interest going.
I honestly thought the moment this hit CNBC it would be over. But what I wasn't counting on was everyone jumping in front of a camera without bothering to understand the point of discussion.

Better yet... Encourage small businesses to adopt it. My wife is in the primary stages of planning a business that will promote bitcoin as a payment method.
These will be the early adopters who disrupt the system and promote the virtuous cycle of continued uptake. And they will be rewarded.

I was watching the price drop from mid-30s to the 20s. I started playing with my daughter and forgot about it. Rock &amp; Roll.

I bought my house in 2009. I got some money for down payment from a friend. When my bank asked where the deposits of $X came from I simply explained that I keep cash on hand at home. I simply deposited the cash in anticipation of the house purchase. There was never a problem after that.

Ya, and suddenly they have btc for sale.  No waiting for a market price a week from today.  I'm so glad that the concept of investing is not new to me.  5 years ago I would be a bag-holder.  Today, I was able to foresee that when it turned around it would be straight down.  Too many newbs who have never invested in anything - even bank CDs - were piling on to this thing.  I was checking this thing every two hours during the night I was so confident it would crack.

Can you explain what a bitcoin day is?  And what it means to be destroyed?
