They need an official one

They both gave a talk today (26 Feb 2014). The book is fairly recent as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 11:51:36
sorry. Thought I did. On mobile

I don't have a link (and I can't find one), but I did record the talk. I'll upload it later.

Don't all I need is the deb file to put it in my jailbroken device?
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:15:57
Agreed. I wrote a bitcoin bot using the coinbase API and I was afraid my bank account would go to zero while making it.

Now they need an iOS app...

That looks like Spotify and not available in the US store

Ah. I overlooked that above. You mine with it? It doesn't effect the hashrate of the card does it?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:20:52
Oh of course... how could I forget that!
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:43:27
So you have personally used the viDock then?
@_date: 2013-03-08 12:14:01
I'll do what I want!
@_date: 2013-03-05 13:00:24
Appears you are out :(
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:02:47
Coinbase has an app and BTCmon is great. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:06:42
And you'll still get denied
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:50:37
So you get 1/78th of the profits from the ~2.2 Gh miner? 
Anyone have estimates on the profits?
@_date: 2013-03-03 06:59:48
I would wait. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:23:19
I use coinbase as my wallet... not to buy/sell bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 04:35:46
It is pretty bad imo.
