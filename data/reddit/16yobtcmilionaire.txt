The last time I saw this I was ship spinning in Jita, and it was ISK, not bitcoins.
Send me your isk, and I'll double it!

Yeah, think about what "widespread adaption" means.  How many of the people you know not interested in computers can even read your post without consulting a dictionary?

This is why Bitcoin in it's current stage is nearly useless for widespread use.  At least with Paypal and credit cards, if the user is an idiot and gets scammed, the financial institutions give them their money back.
Who is going to save the people hurt by this or Mt Gox?  Nobody.

The targets you have to worry about here can't even read your post, let alone follow your advice.


"Hey man I have $300,000 in this Bitcoin stuff, can you help me secure it?  You know computers, right?"
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:03:04
Or don't hold Bitcoin if you don't know what you're doing.  Sell it off and do something you know how to do.

Individuals with no sense of caution or understanding of the system they operate in becoming easy marks for scammers?
Reminds me of Eve Online.  Except those millions are in USD.
Here's a hint:  Maybe if you have no understanding of security for your computer, you shouldn't keep sizable amounts of unprotected currency on it.

You'd be surprised..

I don't think knowing what "hackerspace", "hardware wallet", or "root privileges" means has anything to do with IQ, but since you're obviously a troll and you deleted your account, I don't suppose there's a big point to posting this.

I figured it out, but thanks.  
I just installed the latest version of bitcoin from sourceforge and it worked.

Sorry to hijack thread but
Hi, my Bitcoin app is version 0.3.23-beta and I have no idea how to get by bitcoin out or anything.  I sort of forgot about it a while ago.  I just found this app on my computer after a long time..  I have a coinbase account but no idea how to merge.
picture very relevant
I see on some websites that each bitcoin is like $700 now???  how can I sell this.. I don't have a bank account.
edit: I figured it out.

Uh, where would that be?
I dont really know a lot about this stuff, my friend told me about this in AP calc a while ago and I forgot about it..
EDIT: I figured it out.
