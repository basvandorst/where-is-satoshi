Organizers of the Cryptolina Bitcoin Expo announced today that the Honorable Edmund C. Moy will be the keynote speaker at a Saturday evening dinner on August 16th. 
Ed Moy served as the 38th Director of United States Mint from 2006-2011, and is among the highest ranking former 
government officials to weigh in favorably on Bitcoin. 
“This is a game-changer,” said Faruk Okcetin, an event organizer and entrepreneur. “Ed Moy is widely 
respected among the finance and exchange industry, and is among the highest level officials yet to 
recognize both the future and inevitability of cryptocurrency. 
The Carolinas are thrilled to be hosting Mr. 
Moy’s first appearance at a Bitcoin conference.” 
Edmund C. Moy was appointed by President George W. Bush as the 38th Director of the United States 
Mint in 2006. Confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate, Director Moy was officially sworn into his 
five year term on September 5, 2006. The Mint Director serves as chief officer of the United States Mint 
and advises the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, partners with the Federal Reserve on forecasting demand, 
works closely with Congress, and analyzes payment systems and trends in outlays. 
“Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it, will be a disruptor to the traditional notions of currency,” said Ed Moy. 
“In the end, currency will be better for it.” 
From 2001-2006, Moy was a Special Assistant to the President at the White House. Prior to his public service, Moy spent eight years working in the private sector with venture capital firms and entrepreneurs. He was also on the boards of several companies and nonprofit organizations.
 
Raleigh is playing host to the Carolinas first Bitcoin Expo on August 15th and 16th, 2014. The weekend 
event is being billed as ‘Cryptolina’, and will be held at the Raleigh Convention Center. The goal of the 
expo is to raise awareness and serve as a Bitcoin gateway to hundreds of new interested businesses, 
crowdfunders, investors, students and enthusiasts. 
More than 500 new faces of the emerging Bitcoin community are expected to attend, network and discuss 
this growing industry behind the digital currency.

Moy is one of the highest profile economic leaders to express support and hope for the currency, and this will be his first public speaking engagement on the topic. In a December 2013 blog post published on Money News, he wrote that digital currency promises a cheaper, more secure and efficient way to transact money. That means no more currency wars, exchange rate challenges and arbitrage.
