people no, Amanda only (who is friend of Alice)had decided that Alice Coin has a market cap of 100 million. thats the problem with the market cap on low volume coins.

You can expect 3€ here for a sepa transfer if dont have monthly incomes above 600€ in your account plus 60 € year for account manteinance. 
If you have  monthly incomes above 600€ all are free. Well sepa transfers are not unlimited you have a monthly limit

i can see the trade history in Gdax and it hited 9500$ at 2:23. Was that for real or fake buys to put the price high?

a lot of litle merchants used here (Spain) to ofer a discount if you pay in cash till was declared illegal(Usually a 3%). Now there is a minimum pay with Visa in many stores. All of this is just because of the Visa Fee for the stores.

i can send free from gdax (coinbase exchange). Euro zone, diferent market strategies from EU and US?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:47
yes i am in euro zone and cant trade bch at all in gdax. But was a surprise watch the bch at 9500$. i  can only see about 3 seconds of trade history BCH-$ and the prices are insane

i use SEPA in coinbase and it takes 0 fees to deposit (only the SEPA  fee of your bank, many are free) and 0,15 € to retire. Time varies from 1-3 days. the credit card fees are too high but you get it at the moment.

Hardware wallets have a recovery seed.
if he don't store his paper wallet safe why would be different with the hardware wallet seed?

just asking, you get better return mining ETC and changing to eth than mining eth directly?
i have about 40 m/hs and mine eth not tried ETC because mining calculator puts eth with better profit, should i try ETC? i am getting 0.034 eth per week in my last payout

Yes , for the amount of the fill, the rest  stays in the book.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:42:41
Yes, it is a very basic  btc rule, allways buy lambo. Noobs
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:14
i dont understand, so is coinbase with his own money who buys your BCH? When you are selling isnt other user buying or i am mising something?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:03
but some one has to buy the BCH with fiat in the exchange so someone has to put their $ € in coinbase  before. it is users money not coinbase money
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:08:56
If the money is dirty maybe he pays more than the market price to the seller for the risks.

Or you can write in several languages, and you have a bad grammar in English but good in your language, and people who only can speak English thinks that are smarter than you.

At least you can buy Etc with BTC. ��

the text? Just pointing that you dont have to mix all the words of the text when finding just the words that could be part of the seed.
In the sia seed example you only have to look for those words
 
the rest can be discarted automatically unless you use custom seeds
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:48:12
Only a limited rangue of words can be in  some seeds, so brute force  could have  a chance.
What if there is only 12 words that could be part  of the seed in your text? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:40:56
Yes i know. And if you use a custom seed it would be imposible.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:31:10
I am afraid im not skilled enought, maybe some smart guy could find out the wallet you are using and try bruteforce but you have a big history, it is so much text.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:10:50
yes thats whats a salary means.
the point is if someone has btc and want to buy someting in btc and at the same time buy back btc i dont see nothing wrong with it if they have the fiat to buy back.
Is like refilling your saves account when you use it and can recharge.
obviusly if they are buying back by credit or more than they can afford then they should think twice
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:00:04
When i buy with Fíat, because i get refilled my bank account with fiat  each month by my salary i dont need to sell  something to get my Fíat back
@_date: 2018-07-28 03:50:44
Maybe, but it is just a wallet that "airdrop" coins if it is running, it has no impact on battery life and very little in internet data. They advertised it as new gen mobile mining and apple banned them. Hope Google don't do the same

This Sunday I was doing a transfer from the mobile app of my bank and they offered instant transfer for free.  
Must be this.

But hide it or Nelson will steal it at the school.
@_date: 2018-07-28 03:36:06
Still works, it is not real mining, they give you the coins just for run the app.

What's the point of governments mining a decentralized P2P cash?
 If only governments are mining it is centralized, if it is centralized you don't need a POW blockchain.
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:46:51
They don't owe you the indemnitation. They still owe you all your salary for the days you worked.
If they go totally broke the government cover a part of the money through FOGASA (fondo de garantía salarial) but is a long process and they not always pay. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:44:57
In some countries if you don't go to work, even if they aren't paying you for months, you can be fired without indemnitation. Spain for example.
