This is a really great article but the ad hominem attacks detract from the article and I wish they weren't there. Examples:








I think he gives undue credit to academic degrees and titles (professor, PhD, etc.) when this space (Bitcoin) is populated by very credible non-academics - including himself.

It's unusual that the source of emissions estimates in the [Nature Climate Change paper by Mora]( seems to be unvetted - i.e. the blog of de Vries - and a [correspondence by Fonteinis]( who also cites de Vries and says:


However, Fonteinis seems to have ignored the contents of another [paper]( he cites, where the authors (Hileman and Rauchs) state:


This study was funded by VISA and to my knowledge not peer-reviewed (from what I gather about SSRN publications). Not to say peer-review is infallible (as Mora's publication indicates), but citations to technical reports, government documents, etc. are typically required to support claims in peer-reviewed literature (which may not be publicly available for Chinese provinces as in this case). This article seems to include some citations but not for the last statement, though it does corroborate the one made by Mr. Sharratt regarding his conversations with colleagues in Hong Kong.
**Addendum** Also, the [article]( in the journal Joule is not a research article, but a commentary, which ["may not be subject to peer review, at the discretion of the editorial team."](

It's not strange that she doesn't ask for more info on paid work -
 you can assume she's getting good offers elsewhere - but it's strange that she says she's not working on any other projects right now.
