I look at bitcoin more as a virtual gold, rather than a currency. I mean for example you can buy stuff with gold but why would you?
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:11:00
I am sorry what? When is the central bank ever printing money with no discipline?
If your talking of quantitative easing which I assume is what you're suggesting, that was necessary since monetary policy was rendered ineffective at stimulating demand post-recession. However, I hardly see how that was a bad thing, need I remind you of the 1929 depression? Besides a devalued currency can be a good thing, from one it can reduce a current account deficit, secondly, it will also increase countries international competitiveness.  Also, Trump's actually looking to devalue the currency, because he wants FED to lower interest rates, Which is a great thing for commodities like gold.  
Moreover, I could see bitcoin becoming like a sort of "commodity" although this is speculation, since outside the realms of holding the currency as an investment and maybe purchasing goods, although the number of people who use bitcoin to buy stuff is very small at around 36% of bitcoin owners. For this reason, I don't actually see a real long term use for bitcoin. 
  
This was never really a debate, on whether I see bitcoin being a good investment or it's long term use. I was purely pointing out that the majority of this subreddit are ideologues; That see bitcoin as a means to end of achieving de-centralization of banking. Which is fine, this is a reaction of the turbulent decade of the financial markets. However, because of this, it worries me, that the "hype" for bitcoin is built on a castle in the sky, for achieving some utopian future, which in my eyes has an almost 0%  chance of happening, therefore in the near future when this is realized, bitcoin will be rendered useless and it will burst mark my words. 
SIDENOTE  
Why do I write this stuff no one's going to read it ahahah.

I like the sentiment, but I personally don't see a world were central banks would not regulate bitcoin. This is the main reason I fear investing in bitcoin; I feel like a lot of the hype comes from ideologues that believe in the future governments and banks will have no control over the currency which is impossible and preposterous. 
It comes down to one single factor, MONEY LAUNDERING. This is a fantastic idea, but do we really want a society, were unregulated illegal money is rife within society, which will facilitate the evilest people in society with untraceable funds, to carry out unspeakable acts, I think not? 
But, by all means, prove me wrong I am fascinated by bitcoin and the cryptocurrency phenomena hence why I am subscribed to this subreddit. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:24:14
Very eloquently put, upvote nice sir 
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:42:46
I don't buy that argument if I am honest. Sure people launder money, but bitcoin provides a perfect tool to do so which you think the government is going to let slide?  Sure on hind site maybe I shouldn't have based my argument on the money laundering, as to a degree, all money is dirty.
But, it just worries me when the bitcoin subreddit is filled with people who believe that bitcoin is the future on the principle of it taking power away from the government and banks; by the looks of this guy, he is an anarcho-capitalist. Which is worrying because it paints a picture that the support from bitcoin doesn't fundamentally come from the belief in the technology or even as a future investment. But as a means to an end, which in his case would be complete decentralization.   
Which to my mind, when everyone knows that this is not where bitcoin will be headed as you have said allowing "bitcoin to be defacto base value monetary instrument" likely won't happen. It may render the currency useless and decrease the support for bitcoin. Hence why I still fundimentally believe that in the long run bitcoin will be a bubble. Even if in the short term and maybe in the medium term it has some gains. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:50:30
Sure, but I can't see how that's a fair comparison. Since its just a medium of exchange? 
It just worries me, that a lot of bitcoins "cult following" comes from this ideological belief of being free from censorship and the control of central banks. Seriously make a cost-benefit analysis, are you seriously going to tell me that if the whole world used untraceable money that would be a good thing? 
Again, this would benefit corrupt nations and evil people the most, such as terrorism. 
Then ask yourself, would the government let this happen? The answer is no they won't. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:30:53
Ahaha no the meme says it reaches 1 million ������
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:00:50
Without looking at fundamentals, how can you predict that? Generally curious I am coming from trading stocks. Where you looking only at fundamentals.
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:43:54
I think I will invest in that, once I see some returns in the interim are there any free alternatives? 
But, on the whole it looks like Coinbase is safe, I have just heard horror stories about these coin exchanges loosing bitcoins. I am currently not exposed to that much risk, since I don't have all that much money at risk. So I couldn't justify 20-30% of my capitol on a hardware wallet just yet.
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:40:04
No I was referencing the fact that bigots clearly have fewer Brain cells, in a post which you conveniently deleted.
Also Hitlers, big issue with Jews stemmed from his rejection by Jewish people in the art world.
Jewish people, are known as the people of the books. And place emphasis on education and intelligence hence why they are successful and achieve high positions in society.
While you can't even proof read a meme.

First off Fuck you
Second off are you a bitcoin millionaire.... NO your not....
Third off, the more people that enter bitcoin, the more money we make so its counterproductive to try put off the so called "noobs".  But hey I am sorry for trying to learn more about bitcoin, and clogging up your bitcoin subreddit.
Also, bitcoin is no longer a passion project for anarch-capitalists with delusions of a full decentralised financial system.. I just want to use bitcoin to put some of my profits from Disney into. This is an investment vehicle for me.
Also its cunts like you that make me loose faith in bitcoin. This is not some exclusive club, bitcoin is a commodity the more people that know and have access the better.
Again Fuck you, Again Fuck you
And again you probably trade by drawing resistance and support lines. So far maybe you have got lucky?
You condescending fuckAnd finally fuck you, you fucking nerdy cunt
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:21:41
Sure, but if you believe you can predict bitcoin prices, by drawing lines on a chart, you are servely misguided. 
Bitcoin is no longer a grassroot passion project. I believe that as bitcoin evolves it will become more and more like a commodity. My sentiment is backed up by 68% of investors saying they would investment in crypto within the next 3 years.

No time like the present gotta have chutzpah
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:53:42
Bitcoin is too powerful &amp; better then the US dollar lets ban it...
I am not libertarian, I believe that the government should intervene in some circumstances
but seeing this makes me question the power and authority of the government.

Only 8% of the population during the 1920s had shares in stocks.

UK :(
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:40:01


Well, no I have been trading stocks for over 2 years now. So I have a basic understand of how the market works. 
Also I know what I am doing, but this a counter productive comment. We make money on bitcoin because more people want to enter the market and buy bitcoin. So making it as accessible as possible should be priority one. 
So take your elitism else where.
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:48:16
It had no relevance to the post, i just hate anti-sematism thats all.
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:19:55
Please tell me you're joking, and have you still not worked out what's wrong with the title of your reddit post?
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:37:10
I am on Mac so malware is t such an issue. If bitcoin proves profitable I will invest in hardware. But till then it’s not justified. As I am only risking a small amount of capitol.

Also you can’t spell February so maybe  you should “read a book”
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:21:02
That’s  brutal, could you not of hide some of your bitcoins in an anonymous wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:45:58
I got excited lol. 
I also only started to question its legitimacy once I had deposited my money.

Nothing to see here but an illiterate anti-Semite
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:38:39
Just read the meme, then look at the title
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:45:43
ahah you went deep into this number. No he had anti-sematic posts on his reddit page, which i thought was funny since he couldn't proof read a meme.
