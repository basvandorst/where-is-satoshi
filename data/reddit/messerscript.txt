Yea its scary, I am also on bittrex. I was planning to buy a laptop with Ubuntu to access the site in the future but I will start looking into one right away. I will also change from gmail to protonmail like someone suggest bellow.

He said his gmail was also compromised, the bittrex login email was was flag as spam and sent to trash can by the attacker so he never got the login notification.
If he had 2FA on his gmail he would of probably been fine.
Someone else mention the government/business can get access to gmail accounts easily and can search emails for the google 2FA private key to disable it without requiring the user phone.
I am  not sure what is protonmail but I think it encrypts all your emails and you are the only one that can read them.

Maybe he's been login through the fake site for weeks and was getting redirected to the real site.

Looks like OP got infected by a virus, maybe just by viewing an Ad on some website, so uBlock could also help. Most of the viruses are made for windows so using linux would be consider safer.

I'll repost my other comment if you missed it


They are other linux distro much safer than ubuntu (I will also look into a browser other than chrome) but what I want is just to stop using a windows pc for my bitcoin stuff. Ubuntu is the most popular linux distro and its easy to get into.

Can you check your host file with notepad to see if there a fake DNS address inside.
