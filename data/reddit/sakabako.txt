In order to form conclusions from your observations of the stars you must first perform experiments locally. For example, performing spectral analysis on different materials and comparing those to the stars.

You are correct, formal sciences are not natural sciences. The economy, however, is not purely theoretical.

You can't perform an experiment with a control group on an entire economy.

You'll need spectral analysis to determine their mass, which is a large factor in how they move.

Every two weeks or so the bitcoin system collectively decides the difficulty of mining. If many more people start mining, it will simply become harder to create a valid block in the block chain.
The _return_ an individual gets from mining will go down, but the overall return should end up at more or less the price of electricity.

It may go to $3xx. Except for tax purposes your buying price is irrelevant. The price will do what it will do no matter what you bought it at.
