I don't think he knows what crypto is, but honestly I'd be surprised if there were many gov't officials who were pro. A decentralized currency directly undermines the American dollar.

Bcash's big blocks work, it's hard to knock that angle. But it's not unique to Bcash, either. Plenty of alt coins have low and quick transactions. Bitcoin Core is the odd man out here. If SegWit2x could've fixed the problem, I don't know why it was rejected out of hand. I doubt a modest block bump would've been difficult to implement easily either or require years of robust testing.

Currently staring at a 14 hour old transaction of mine that is still yet to get even one confirmation, it's hard to give a fuck about the debate around SegWit and block sizes and Lightning network and multi-layer and so-called attacks or what have you when, right now, practically speaking, the chain is completely useless to me unless I am willing to overspend massively on fees.
It's tough to care about ideological purity or long-term or "the right way to do things." It was wrong and stubborn to reject SegWit2X. It was the perfect solution. Bumping the block size modestly would've helped tremendously for the blockchain. SegWit is not some perfect solution, the fact it requires mass adoption and doesn't just flip on and automatically start working is very evident as a flaw.
Maybe in six months or a year when (we hope) the Lightning network stuff is working and SegWit is being used even more I'll have long since forgotten about this era, but as of right now Bitcoin is dramatically failing for my practical use. 
The price does not bother me. It goes up, it goes down. I bought at $50, I bought at the first time it crossed $1000, I bought that dip, I've bought since then. I am numb to that kinda thing. But what I'm not numb to is: excessive fees and arduously long transaction times. Price is fuck all, usability is king, and if Bitcoin's devs continue to ignore the problem then the chain is going to die. End of story. In a perfect world they would have all the time they need to fix stuff, but we don't live in that world. This needed to be fixed half a year ago, and instead I just have to deal with the chain getting grossly congested and locking up. Seriously, what the fuck?

Honestly it's moments like this that makes me want to know more. Since this is at the root of my current issue, is there a comprehensive post or reasoning given as to why they don't support a modest block size boost? I understand that large blocks favor miners, so I get wanting to avoid that, but surely smaller boosts would have little downside?

I think "destined to fail" is a bit of a harsh statement.
That said I agree that confirmations should never go above 20 minutes at maximum, and that 10 minutes is still too slow. I don't know the technical reasons why it's like this, or if it can ever be made faster.

This is a really well-written article that paints a fairly neutral light. Doesn't proselytize, but doesn't condemn. Stuff like this is extremely important because it doesn't sound like someone is trying to sell you a product, nor rip into it. It treats it straight and simple, which means it's being accepted.

Needs to be $710ish to be stable above $700. I feel like $720 is the next big landmark.. think it hit around there right before the Gox news hit hard and tanked it.

Same. I regularly translate thousands of dollars of Bitcoin back and forth via many methods and it is nearly instant and I get multiple confirmations within 30 minuets.
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:08:50
Volatility is murder. I'm not here buying bitcoin expecting some meteoric rise into the thousands once more. I've been with bitcoin when it was $50, and when it was $1200+, and all I cared about was practical usability. If it goes up and down a bit and I lose or gain some cash, I don't mind.
This has been a long, brutal drop from historic highs. And it keeps on going. For a full year, bitcoin was functionally useless to the common buyer. It's just lost and lost and lost value. What is the point? You could talk eons about how secure and mathematical and brilliant it all is, but the price speaks volumes.
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:47:59
Honestly, I'm with you at this point. Sorry, too much volatility. I try to spend my bitcoin within weeks of using it, to try and see where I can use it, how useful it is. I do hold on to some, of course, but I try to practically use it--not hold on and try and make profit.
But what's the use? Coinbase takes awhile and is the resource I trust most, but while I buy coins it has inevitability been tumbling down and down. No transaction fee digital currency means nothing if, by the time I get it, it's down $50+ dollars so I've lost money.
Currently, it's pointless. It's not functional for the common user.

From the top to the bottom, honestly. Crypto grew explosively in value, which influenced and corrupted a lot of individuals. Back when it was around $50 the profit angle was present, but a lot of it was about improving the technology as a whole. It was an enthusiast's game.
But now we're far past that point. The majority of people are concerned only with price. This happens even at the highest levels. I don't think hard forks would occur if everyone had the same goal of improving the technology in the most responsible fashion.

Normally, I don't care a damn if the account is 5 years or 3 months. But the timing right now throws up warning flags, most of which can easily be verified by briefly glancing at the account's history.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:39:25
Tried very shortly and immediately gave it up. The price has been tumbling ever since the $1k peak, a slow downward trickle. I got very tired of buying coins, and then a week later I've lost cash because the price kept slipping down. I almost never got caught in an upwind, and the utter lack of stability meant the only logical thing to do was to buy it and immediately spend it..
In which case what's the point?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:31:51
Lots of big money making their presence known, to put it simply. There are two Bitcoin chains competing, the failure of SegWit2X is leading to some big time whales to start moving.

You won't find one.
Anyone telling you X or Y will happen with confidence is biased or foolhardy. No one knows. While Bitcoin has had bigger swings and bigger percentage-losses in the past, some of the factors currently at play are unique and unprecedented.
What we know is: 
1. the pump-and-dump cannot go on forever. A number of large money individuals are heavily influencing what's going on.
2. Difficulty readjustment is going to disrupt the hashrate migration, but to what effect, no idea.

Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt.

The long-term upside of Bitcoin is incredibly high. Current power usage, transaction time, and transaction fee are short-term problems actively being worked on. So far, Bitcoin has proven adaptable and has overcome numerous challenges and doubts. The combination of resilience, optimism, and promise leads to new investors and growing adoption. This leads to a price increase. The price increase itself tempts more hands.

"Be greedy when others are fearful" is brospeak in Bitcoin circles for "Yo dog go catch that falling knife for me."
You'd think Bitcoin had sharp edges from how badly it tends to cut anyone interested in it.

I personally believe SegWit2X is an inevitability and think it's a good compromise solution that will help in the long-run.
But I don't want the chain to fork unnecessarily. Bundling multiple upgrades and doing it together rather than trying to force it early is the key to a stable future. And if it turns out we don't really need 2X? Fine, ditch it. No harm no foul.
@_date: 2015-04-27 08:18:07
Price goes up, and up, then down, down, down, down down down down.
