A country running on btc or cryptocurrencies would have a defacto 0% tax rate tho. That's why I brought that up.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:34:22


Huh? This is very wrong , no country ever had a tangible benefit by charging a 0% tax rate (which is the tax rate that a country running on bitcoin would charge) . Have you ever been to non touristic spots in Cayman , BVI , Bahamas , Maldives , Bermuda , Kitts &amp; Nevis...
Absolute shitholes , populated by nothing but Mangroves and mosquitos those countries would become little Dubais with even a 10-12% corporate tax to build some infrastructure 
The approach which works for the wealth and competitiveness of a country is charging a tax rate 10-20% lower than others , have no capital gain tax or VAT. This is the Swiss/HK/SP approach , in fact Switzerland , HK , Singapore are the wealthiest countries on Earth on a per capita basis with basically no natural resources to speak of but they do have double figure tax rates
Problem is this approach might be good for the country , but not for the status of politicians and even more so the leader of the country , in fact , I challenge you to name the PM/President of Singapore/Hong Kong or the Federal president of Switzerland. You can't , because they basically have little power to interfere with free market while everybody knows and respects Trump , Putin , Merkel , Xi JinPing , Macron , Prince of Saud because of their continuos interference with free market . What gives power to politicians is their capability to interfere with free market , without that they are nothing .
Considering all this it is a mystery to me that countries still have a 0% tax rate and can only be explained by funds coming from the British Crown and funds from companies and trusts held by foreigners , directly transferred into companies and trusts of local politicians

Risky AF tho...they did it around 9 am which is a time of the day not unusual for the SEC to make announcements , so if news broke out that the ETF was rejected....REKT...not to mention the risk of the exchanges collapsing...
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:52:39
But they don't know the time of the announcement , so everyone would jump in as well as those who now know that people would jump in , that person would sell 5 minutes before the announcement and would make a yuge profit regardless of the outcome

Test pump , somebody wants to test how the market reacts to a potential insider leak , probably they know the time of the announcement but not if it's rejected or not , so they are trying to make money off people who'd treat price as a prediction market and would jump in without knowing the outcome themselves.

Why not going long w/leverage on btc and then selling high to buy alts?
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:31:18
Well it's easy to say that , greater adoption is not a guarantee for miners , especially with all the possible regulation which could hit BTC as soon as it scales both in China and elsewhere ; he might want to secure a ROI on his mining equipment before moving into uncharted territory ; what would the price be if the PBOC didn't shut the exchanges down? 1500? 2000? What if the same happens in Europe , Japan , US and all the other OCED countries? Back to 100?

Yep , but again it's not like real life identity is associated with [graphs like these]( , still statists , SJW and communists use them to gain consensus among the population , I agree that with bitcoin they would not be able to forcefully take funds from people , but again nothing stops them from targeting mining farms , if bitcoin becomes popular we might witness global protests and global coordinated attacks against mining farms , recent events show that SJWs and communists show up to protest by the millions even when they don't have any skin in the game (all those who protested against Trump in foreign countries) , think what would happen when their welfare is on the line on a global scale!

a draft law barring banks from opening bank accounts to CCs exchanges....can't propel demand if you can't send wires to exchanges...if the US do something like this selling pressure on exchanges in other jurisdictions would be gargantuous because US individuals would scramble to liquidate , as well as every other holder as everybody would be afraid that other countries would do the same thing.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:08:48
My understanding is that the more people mine bitcoin the more difficulty increases , problem being that everybody who mines bitcoin has a different Break Even Point which is , of course dependent on Bitcoin price . 
Now suppose some event (a major hack or even a draft law  barring banks from opening bank accounts to CCs exchanges or whatever reason) causes a major dip in the price of bitcoin , like back to the 1xxx or even less than 1000 , many miners would close shop as the price is now insufficient to break even let alone make a profit , just like oil as the price of the commodity tanks only those who have the highest margins can keep the operations going , BUT the difficulty is set by the hashrate which was mining on the network before the drop in price and the consequent flee of miners so this would cause the network to come to an halt as the few miners who keep running their operations represent just a small fraction of the pre black swan hash rate . We've seen something like this the other day when miners briefly switched to BCH.
Also retargeting is scheduled every 2016 blocks , but blocks would take many hours if not days to be found considering that only a small percentage of the hashrate would keep mining . 
So my question is : how low should the price tank to freeze the network? 
What happened in the past when 40-50% retraces happened? As miners closed shop was it hard to accumulate the 2016 blocks necessary to ensure a retargeting?
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:34:52
how long would it take in hours/days/weeks/months ? I get the 2016 blocks , I also get that milage varies heavily depending on the hashrate.

You need to start spending some of your big profits and hire some lobbyists . 51% attacks , hacking and ddos are scary , but state actors don't need that to harm cryptocurrencies and your business model ; they'd simply prevent people from buying into crypto by figuratively putting tanks on the bridges to get on the other side of the pond . 
Exchanges are said bridges and they are vulnerable , hence they should start spending money for lobbyists .

Just worry about your own risks and risk distribution and your bets ; most importantly regardless of PR and virtue signaling remember that they are not in the game for "humanity" or "society" or any other claims they might make to look better ; they are in the game for the same exact reason as people in here trying to predict if btc would break through 1800 tonight : money and status.

Again even if that was the case it does only mean that the number of people interested in censorship resistance and decentralization is even lower as normal people sold their BTC to hard believers , libertarians and ancaps and nerds as the price collapsed and they grew their stack

That is simply not true. those are very few people who hold vast amounts of bitcoins , that's bitcoin's 1%ers , 99% of the people hold 0.1-1 btc and they'd have never bought btc if not for price increase....also are you so sure that 2013 holders would hold if the price were to halve...say 1250? I don't think so , people would not burn millions for ideals...

It isn't a fallacy , without inflation people hoard onto their money because they know that it would be worth more tomorrow than today , this is what happens in BTC , supposedly a currency which nobody uses because it isn't the rational thing to do. If people hoard onto their money collaboration goes out of the window ...also old money are rewarded just for being old money and rich individuals don't have to redistribute wealth (no taxation in BTC) ; this would quickly cause riots , perhaps wars as people would find an alternative mean to redistribute wealth (violence)

This is not true in bitcoin as countries always take their cut in the form of taxation , and , are able to do so because they control the currency and banks , if a country enables people to buy bitcoin and those people actually start exchanging goods and services for bitcoin without converting it back to fiat , that country has lost all potential tax revenues from that person , basically forever.

Wrong answer , he's a dev not fuckng Henry Kissinger , he's there to sell his product , except there's no way to sell a permissionless blockchain to governments , especially dictators , so the only rational thing left is that he's trying to be the go to guy for China and Russia to build a state blockchain , which would defacto kill the public blockchain.

On top of that people who bought into stuff which would plummet would feel scammed , they'd be the ones calling regulators and complaining , Andreas says "we" should not regulate this phenomena , but in reality a good dose of pragmatism suggests that those people would not eat their loss and accept responsibility with goes with freedom in this space , they'd scream to get their money back just like they did with Mt.Gox ; at that point regulators are just gonna regulate , they are in the game for the social status which being a gatekeeper gives to them

do you even risk adjust in your calculations , bro? Also That 2008 can turn really fast as soon as those who ~~scammed people out of their money~~ did all those ICO would have to dump in order to either :
Deliver a product if they are legit or just buy lambos at idiots expenses . So many ETH moved from thousands of hodlers into  into few entities pockets , those entities again scammy or legit would have expenses and they'd finance those with ETH.

He's right , despite all the decentralization talk governments can shut down exchanges like it happened in China and also to Bitfinex .
