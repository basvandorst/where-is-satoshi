It’s a happy coin.
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:26:10
Funny you say that, my dad drove a cab for thirty years! 
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:50:25
Ill take them

The average crypto trader/investor doesn’t actually have a clue what they’re actually investing in. Thus, the sense security of the Coinbase’ s and the Binance type of exchanges are what they need. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 02:44:02
Clearly you don’t understand the space to be asking this question in the manner you’re asking it. Feels ignorant. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:22:00
His three weeks of expertise should indicate we should all double down immediately 
@_date: 2018-05-31 03:45:08
I don’t see why anyone would want to support a non-fan?? Which makes you twice as ignorant for saying so.
@_date: 2018-10-22 04:26:22
Oh, you missed it
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:52:51
Cryptocurrency has not crashed below 6000, ridiculous title.

This infomercial does not guarantee financial success or gains in any way whatsoever except to me, and crypto currencies are a volatile market, invest at your own peril.

He must have the ruler of confirmation 
@_date: 2019-02-03 06:26:32
Yet? You know it’s going to $100k?? Well I better hold my bags then
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:20:24
Sounds like she really loves you, 3 years together and you don’t even have twenty bucks to scratch together, I don’t think you have anything to worry about 
@_date: 2019-02-16 03:53:41
My take on your take is that I take it you know as much about the future as the rest of us, which is one take away from zero
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:36:44
And can spell transfer
@_date: 2019-02-26 03:48:11
He always says when everyone else is selling you should be buying and vice versa...maybe his bags aren’t big enough yet for him to say anything good about btc yet
@_date: 2018-11-09 04:46:59
DYOR bro
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:49:59
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:48:16
Another satoshi billionaire, congrats to you! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:53:27
You should just keep buying when you can. I have been buying small amounts weekly for over two years. It will even out in the long run...I hope! 
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:33:52
It’s happened before and nobody, literally nobody can predict if or when it will happen again. 
But most likely next week, Tuesday, around 8:34pm, eastern time, fill your bags, ya heard it here first 
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:34:17
I just did at 7089
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:03:48
You’re right, how unfortunate! Lol
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:20:31
Fuck this post
@_date: 2019-01-02 05:15:13
You are definitely not the first to use that word
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:15:25
This. 
Well known website that is not mentioned. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:39:47
I bought more at 7089, and would buy even more if I had the spare fiat
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:14:53
You spelled it correctly the first time! 
@_date: 2019-01-04 04:30:02
TBH, I’ve been using Coinbase for a couple years now without a single issue. Fees suck, but c’est la vie
@_date: 2019-01-27 06:15:59
Well then, at least my great great grandchildren will be set! 
@_date: 2019-01-26 01:29:47
I need as much time as bitcoin can give me to fill my bags, thank you
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:48:44
I thought Satoshi should’ve appeared in a metaphysical form with your next steps. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:53:02
Another satoshi billionaire, good job man!
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:59:03

Got no issues with my RBC MasterCard 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:04:36
I’d prefer feb 2023
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:46:03
No loss, I’m sure by tomorrow morning my investment will be in the green! 
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:53:53
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:40:28
10 mentioned...
Celsius 
Menlo one
Gameflip 
Fcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:07:22
The correct answer is you should always be buying 
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:10:33
I should’ve gotten paid for clicking on that link.

Based on my extensive TA research and scientific computations, I see a circle-ish pattern happening, this clearly demonstrating to tHE MOON...of course!  But hey, DYOR. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:20:22
And I’m a satoshi millionaire!
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:06:25
You have to think of Bitcoin as you do real money, because it is. If you’re American and you want to buy Canadian dollars, you could buy 10 cents worth. Our dollars and fiat currency has 2 decimal places. 100 cents make up one dollar, but for bitcoin there are 8 decimal places and instead of cents, there’s satoshis, 1 hundred million (100000000) satoshis makes up 1 Bitcoin. 
So you can buy as many satoshis, or fractions of Bitcoin as someone will sell you!
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:36:52
The Jedi have converted their republican credits for BTC today
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:50:10
Don’t forget to buy high and sell low
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:06:34
Buying is cheaper than mining atm
@_date: 2018-12-25 05:44:23
Do a few reps, buy some btc, do a few more reps. Seems like a regular work out �� 
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:00:27
I don’t necessarily believe the stock market and the crypto market can really be that easily compared.
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:38:13
So your total investment was 13 bucks!! If only we are all so lucky
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:26:59
Crypto is like a watch, it’s going to fuck you in circles, clockwise. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:39:48
Lmao, I love the clueless. Enjoy getting rekt buddy! 
@_date: 2018-12-16 05:56:47
I also agree, which is why I argue it’s credibility. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:09:57
I can agree, but correct me if I’m wrong but your chart is titled Wall Street market cycle. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:01:22
He should’ve called himself shortdick instead of talldad
@_date: 2018-12-30 06:42:02
Almost went broke 
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:17:27
Someone probably meant to put in a buy order at 1000.00 and maybe slipped on the decimal point 
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:06:37
If Market cap is not the total amount of money that has been poured in to BTC then is it possible to identify how much money has been? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:59:40
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:09:22
I have honestly bought small amounts weekly over the 14 months. My cost average is probably around 6500, but regardless I continue to buy 50-100 bucks weekly. I know it doesn’t mean much to the guys with loot but I’m doing my part. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:46:16
Yes, it may feel like a golden shower, but hold on to your nickers it will turn around
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:46:17
The curve could go the opposite direction. What idiot created this graph?!
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:31:57
$3813 in the next 30 minutes 
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:21:59
You can always use a bitcoin ATM, but they do have high fees.
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:46:50
So the market cap is not the amount that in essence is the store of value behind BTC? Like the way it used be for gold and fiat?? I thought the real value in crypto was that the market cap was an actual amount in holding per se that backed up BTC.
