No. They offer lots of 10-15% off store wide deals, and free basic shipping, but nothing like prime. No where (except ShopRunner stores) offer something like prime (no one else can).

I'm with you here, I'd love a practical use case answer to why this is a bad idea. 
Most of the replies are parroting dogma about bitcoin&lt;--&gt;anonymity, and I'm pretty sure law enforcement has shown us that is kinda BS...

Fact. This is why tobacco, and other crops, were called 'cash crops'. In fact, they were 'cash crops' in Virginia and other tobacco growing states for almost 150 years

fascinating. So you didn't actually know the password, it was just stored on the Yubikey? How do you back it up/store it elsewhere?

Hey, where do you want to be notified of misc. bugs etc. I've noticed a couple while putting items up. Can provide screen-shots etc. to help diagnose.

Buy something real with BTC. My gf didn't think it was real until I bought some hardware from bitcoinstore.com

technically jailbreak voids warranty (afaik) -- that being said, reflash to stock image and voila, warranty back. helpdesk/apple wont support a jailbroken device.

Brilliant, thank you. 
Now, this is a naive question, but, what stops this number-- ~21mil -- from changing?

To be clear, you pay (are invoiced) at the end of the Drop, for the equivalent of $15 in BTC.

"Apple strongly cautions against installing any software that hacks iOS. It is also important to note that unauthorized modification of iOS is a violation of the iOS end-user software license agreement and because of this, Apple may deny service for an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that has installed any unauthorized software."
YMMV with applecare, but it is still against their policy.

Yeah, less so a 'random string' -- but any phrase in history/time .. Without knowing more about the author/mind of the person, that's what makes the entropy of pass phrases so much stronger.
I mean, I imagine you're Finnish (given that one of the phrases are in Finnish) so having English as a second/third/nth language would also drastically skew what you consider 'common'... Also I can't figure any of them out and its frustrating me :)
Nice game though...

Hell, LRM is so pro, I didn't even get a chance to worry about it-- BitFunder started shutting down, I got a note saying "Don't worry, we got this." and continue to get Divs :)
