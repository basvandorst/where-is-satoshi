This "money doesn't buy happiness" stuff is utter drivel. It at least buys you a resistance to a myriad of financial issues that would prevent you from living your life to the fullest. As someone who was once on the breadline and is now relatively comfortable, the difference it makes to your mental wellbeing is stark.
I can only think that those who've always been financially comfortable don't get it and those who've always been poor are just lying to themselves, honestly.

You're looking at it backwards.
You're either an otherwise happy person plagued by financial woes and worries, or you're... a happy person. And there's a lot of space in-between as well.
Not to mention that in many places in the world you'll need money to get effective help if you're genuinely depressed.

It looks like it will only go up in London long-term, even if there is a crash around the time we leave the EU (RIP).

I absolutely agree.
An equivalent example is WhatsApp. All they need to retain their userbase is exactly that, their userbase. Nobody wants to move. Doesn't matter if Telegram is slightly superior - 90% of people aren't moving and they'll keep the 10% back with them too.

You sound as if you think there's only one concrete approach to an economy.

As an example, there's a guy who was a writer, searched for "how to kill your wife" and suddenly found SWAT at his door. 
Not to mention that it's a massive, egregious violation of privacy, and willingly playing along with it gives them the 'a-okay' to continue doing it and eventually inevitably go even further.
And if you really don't care about that (why wouldn't you? jesus) you can just utilise the !bang system, that along with !g will save you a wealth of time.
Regarding the bang system, a few I've used today:
!w = Wikipedia
!g = Google
!gyear = Google, within past year
!pcper = PC Perspective
!r = Reddit
.. there's an endless supply of these awesome things.
So let's summarise:
- Even if the search results are arguably worse, your searching will be *more efficient*
- You can maintain your privacy (mostly)
- In maintaining your privacy, you can send a message to Google and other corporations that you won't stand for them allowing the NSA and GCHQ and whoever else access to *our* data, and you'll send a similar message to the relevant governments and spy agencies too

Because if you give the ASIC miners the advantage you're letting those who rule the old currency begin to rule the new one. That is fundamentally unfair to me.
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:38:20
Person A lost their savings, Person B lost what is a drop in the ocean to them. It's quite simple, no?
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:23:38
Person A starts out with 10 bitcoins. Person B starts out with 1 bitcoin.
Person A has ten times the computational power as person B with purchased/rented hardware and therefore can earn, theoretically, around ten times as much, which will increase exponentially over time.
I deem that unfair. I don't want money making money (with no effort/value put in) in a currency. If it's technically impossible to avoid then so be it, and it may be, but if so I find that mightily disappointing.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:52:57
That sucks. Thanks for the answer though.
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:43:07
Just by inputting them in the search with whatever you're searching for. DuckDuckGo have a database full of them, and you can submit your own, too (I submitted !pcper for PC Perspective and around a month later it was added!).
The full list is astronomical:

No idea, but hearing Randy yelling "Lordey Lorde Lorde Lorde" all the time makes up for it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:44:00
Virtually every media outlet in every nation is biased and untrustworthy about its own nation.
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:22:52
Yeah, same in England. It's a farce.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:52:39
At what point did I say that didn't happen now? No need to be so defensive.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:55:14
No. I would have preferred the protocol to have been programmed in such a way that more powerful hardware does not equal more bitcoins. Easier said than done probably, but hey, there's my opinion. I still think it's unfair to start with.
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:46:17
Risk isn't linear like that. You're not factoring in the money they have to fall back on.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:05:48
Pretty much, yeah. 
Society is depressing.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:17:11
That's a good one. I always used !sp, didn't realise !s was for the same thing.

What luke-jr is attempting to do is hostile in and of itself. response is not unreasonable.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:07:50
This is how it is in London. Most ATMs are free however occasionally there'll be one in a corner shop with a £1-2 fee. My local corner shop has if I recall correctly a £1.75 fee despite being just a five minute walk away from a free ATM at a Tesco petrol station.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:32:54
Then that to me is a design flaw. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:18:29
You're saying it's fair on that basis because those are the rules of the game. I'm saying the rules should disallow the other guy from making exponentially more with no risk.
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:31:34
That logic extends to thoughts, too. It's a very dangerous line of thinking that leads to thought police, whereby you're punished without ever having committed a crime. Think 1984.
Another potential problem (of many) is the prospect of young to-be politicians (or whomever else) searching politically damaging things, especially in their youth. If a young politician has searched for "big booty bitches whore foursomes XXX" (I really don't want to see whatever porno that would end up being lol) that can be used as leverage against them later on in their career, somewhat similarly to how Hoover did for the FBI, according to Wikipedia: "...used the FBI to harass political dissenters and activists, to amass secret files on political leaders, and to collect evidence using illegal methods. Hoover consequently amassed a great deal of power and was in a position to intimidate and threaten sitting Presidents.", then that leaves them and everybody tremendously vulnerable.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:46:43
When those with more paper currency than me can mine bitcoins at a rate a thousand times greater than me it is not, to me, a fair system.
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:46:11
Here in England this would have been grounds for defamation. I think. But I also think you guys have no such similar law.

Tragedy is not determined by what one is hypothetically willing to invest.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:50:32
Our current economy upsets me yes, as I've already explained.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:22:27
Is there any technical way of preventing those with more currency from being able to gain more currency via better/more hardware, out of curiosity? It bothers me that with Bitcoin the people who already have a lot of money now can make a lot more in this new currency like this - a needless(?) continuation of money making money for no good reason.
@_date: 2014-07-07 11:50:39
Because it is Google and more due to the !bang system, and they value your privacy. That's why.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:42:18
Money will still make money, even if at a lesser rate than right now. It is unfair.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:43:24
Except with Bitcoin, a (once) new currency, I don't see why it couldn't have been programmed differently so that, at the very least, you don't get a massive advantage with more expensive hardware.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:41:27
There is no way you can honestly suggest that paper currency is fair right now. Whether it's corruption at the top or a matter of winning the birth lottery nearer the bottom, it's largely unfair. I dislike this new "fair" crypto-currency being distributed essentially based upon who was the luckiest with paper currency - that defeats half of the god damned purpose to me.
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:58:17
'Bitcoin' is not to blame, you are. You should put a significant amount of research into anything to which you will commit that sort of money.
@_date: 2014-10-22 08:29:54
But it isn't 10x the risk when you, being the one with more money, have much more money to fall back on. It's a lot worse for a poor person to lose £1000 than it is a rich person £10000.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:44:02
Then GPU. Now this other alteration of that. It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:24:54
Let's say you want a Google search. With DuckDuckGo, you search whatever you normally would and concatenate '!g' on the end. Same for Wikipedia with !w and countless more. Example:
'cookie thumper !g'
'Man Utd !w'
'GTX 780 Ti !pcper' 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:54:15
And the people who do have savings often won't have enough to risk investing a few grand in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:40:27
Yep, it sounds more like a commodity as-is.
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:29:52
OS X and Linux are inherently more secure than Windows.
Also worth noting that the vast majority of web servers run Linux and as such are already targets. They're simply less exploitable than Windows.
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:31:48
This is what I was going to add. It's easy to prevent Windows or anything else from accessing your Linux file-system with encryption.

Somehow find the magnet link and paste that into your torrent client!

I think there's an option to disable new ads too, but by default you get new ads (which won't include tracking code, obtrusive visuals, etc).
Ads are such a hog as they come from multiple different domains and are monolithic chunks of JavaScript that aim to track you.
I'm not sure yet if I'm ethically with or against this or similar projects, but I think theoretically that it makes very good sense that it would be a lot faster.
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:40:34
It doesn't download the original ads to begin with, that's the point.
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:11:31
Yes way. Extension performance is bottlenecked by the restraints placed upon them and their API. Native modifications to the browser can go much deeper.
@_date: 2016-02-22 13:19:39
You'll actually theoretically still get better performance out of this, in fairness.
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:32:21
You're correct. It's akin to why open source security will always be stronger than those that hide behind security by obscurity.

And where I'm taxed it's even worse. GCHQ...

Not released yet but I suspect Monzo's current accounts will be a good option.

My guess is he puts the map download behind something like an adf.ly barrier.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:54:25
Easier to say in hindsight. There was a real possibility of him 'disappearing' towards the start of all this, and he probably would have had he not known what best to do to in terms of asylum. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:38:25
Likewise. I almost exclusively use Amex for the cashback rates but the Monzo card and app have been excellent when I and family members have used them. Following the company closely!

Everything civilised about society would cease to be without a government keeping stuff in check. The only issue is we need to get off our asses and keep them in check also.

I'm 17 and know how stupid that is. It's not so much a lack of experience as it is just raw stupidity.

I'd be surprised if it was something else.

They're a bit biased in favour of the monarchy, but I think that's solely because of how royalist most of Britain is. In fairness, they did report on the protests at the jubilee when ITV wouldn't (and fuck me sideways was their coverage unbearable). 
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:32:25
Alright, let's shoot with a few initial questions. 
In an anarchic society, how do you deal with say a murder or some other crime? Because people are incredibly knee-jerky in my experience and... yeah, not seeing how else to offset that.
