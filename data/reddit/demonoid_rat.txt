I can't predict the future but if I had to guess I'd say no.
That also has nothing to do with my reply to your post, which is that you are forecasting the value of Bitcoin by tying it *exclusively to personal incomes and savings rates*. That is a wrong way of calculating because it already isn't true today. Are you actually suggesting that is what drives value exclusively? That's extremely simplified. Or could it possibly also be driven by organizational use?
If you think business use doesn't come into play then I can't help you.

Yes, Multibit is a better choice for certain. But judging from my experience I think a lot of new users aren't aware of it - when I started I just did the full client download, closed the page and started the synch. I also see numerous posts (like this one) that reflect the same experience.
Maybe the problem is just new user education.

Your logic fails. For some reason I can't fathom, you are assuming that Bitcoin's value is entirely and permanently dependent on the saving's rates (and therefore income) of private individuals and not say, corporate/nonprofit/government actions and investments. 
Investments on that scale would have a much more important effect than what private individuals do with their savings.
Mind you I don't disagree with your basic premise. I don't think Bitcoin will have a value 1000x it's current value in 2 years and quite possibly ever. It's just that your analysis doesn't mean anything at all for Bitcoin on it's face.

I can't understand why it wouldn't be a barrier.
I gave up entirely on Bitcoin-QT because after 5 days of synchronizing it still wasn't up to date. I'm reasonably tech-aware so I decided to go with Electrum but a) too much adoption of Electrum-like clients forces centralization to the network and b) if that's what the public would need to do there will be a persistant group of the public that will never adopt because they won't know about alternative clients and they will get frustrated with the ref client, delete it and decide Bitcoin isn't worth adopting because "the wallet doesn't work".
The average random person off the street will need to be able to get the ref client functional in minutes (like any other piece of software) if it is to be adopted. It cannot be assumed any longer the average person will be aware enough to find solutions to the synch or patient enough to let it finish after the entirely unreasonable amount of time it takes to get it functional. The client has to work quickly and easily for these people.

Granted on "who would want to take that on" but realistically people *do* take on failing busineses to try to turn them around at a profit.
I actually do believe your implication though. I don't think MtGox can survive much longer. The biggest clue to me that something's up is the amount of time they've drawn this out. Malleability affected exchanges other than Gox. Those exchanges did the same thing Gox did, but resumed withdrawals in a couple days.
The fact that Gox is unable to resolve this after weeks is a huge warning sign that something is horrendously wrong there.
Whether Gox will completely vanish or take on new operations management and a new identity remains up in the air. I think one if those two is inevitable though at this point.

Good summary of the shoddy piece that Leah Goodman put into circulation with that rag she works for.
I especially enjoyed that somebody pointed out "not ruling somebody out" is not "proof this person did this thing". This is like saying "I can't prove a crime *did not* occur, therefore a crime *must have* occurred".
The fact this seemed to entirely escape Goodman in her televised interviews speaks volumes.
I do not expect any major news entities to pick up on the piece linked here to publish critiques if the Newsweek article. Ever.

I'd say there's already been plenty of good.
In fact I'm a little astounded you could even suggest there hasn't been.
You should re-read my reply. It should be pretty clear that I'm saying one significant failure does not destroy an ecosystem, but pushes markets to create solutions. Bitquick has already implemented an API to prove that it has all the coins it needs for each transaction for example.
Other exchanges patched for transaction malleability instantly after Gox blamed their problems on it. Other exchanges already accounted for the problem. Such exchanges have grown since (the market moved). They are just fine.
Gox failed to rectify it's business issues. It went bankrupt. People who didn't pay attention to those problems and stuck with Gox when they could have left lost those coins. This is a free market and all players in it bear responsibility for their actions.

I don't see why you would need two tumblers. Double the fees for no better results.
I think to answer your question people will need a better idea of what you want to use the coins for.
I would do something like this:
1. Buy BTC for cash in-person on localbitcoins.
2. Get the coins deposited in a wallet on your mobile.
3. Transfer coins to a second desktop wallet. You could tumble them first. Not sure it would be necessary though.
4. Transfer from the desktop wallet to an exchange.
5. Trade on the exchange.
6. When ready, withdrawal to a third wallet that you keep on, say, a USB drive.
7. Tumble before you want to purchase with them.

Thank you so much for coming to our community and posting this, Arthur.

You're certainly right that they fail though I would guess with what you seem to have a concern for the bigger worry would be them becoming obsolete over time.
Frankly I'm not sure there is a current tool to meet this need but it would be a big step if there was a good way to accomplish this.
If something like Ethereum - or a better alternative - gets off the ground that would be a good way  to go.
Smart contracts and DACs are complicated and not fully implemented. That is what you are really looking for imo. Can you program? Are you a software developer? Perhaps you know somebody who could help build such a tool? I'm absolutely certain this can be done but AFAIK this kind of issue has not yet been cracked with the protocol.
Edit: typo, I'm almost always on mobile.

The thing is, Bitcoin is a free market.
Free markets work on more than one level. Businesses with bad practices get screwed. So do investors who make bad decisions.
So MtGox operated on a lengthy history of bad practices and as a result it appears to have failed. Investors who chose to continue storing their money in that exchange were burned. Doesn't mean that some people didn't get screwed, but that's how the free market works. The episode should result in better services on offer and more savvy investors in the future. This problem is not unique to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. There has not always been an FDIC for banks for example. There's a reason that changed. Not advocating an FDIC for crypto here but I believe this market will arrive at an answer that is acceptable for the majority and so long as the value trends up over time and new people like you and I are willing to buy in, Bitcoin will only become more robust over time, not less.

Use Electrum or a similar wallet.
I can honestly see zero reason to use the reference client exactly for this problem.First download will take days before you can even use it and as the blockchain grows it will only get worse. It needs to be addressed. Anybody who says this is not a barrier to adoption is touched in the head.

A better alternative that can implement solutions for Bitcoin's problems.
At this point I see these problems -
1. Volatility, price of goods/services is far too fluid in Bitcoin at this point, it can go up or down quite significantly and very quickly.
2. Confirmation time, nobody wants to wait 10 minutes or more to leave after they've already paid for goods.
3. Mining difficulty, transactions don't get confirmed if nobody mines, But incentive to mine permanently falls; who wants to pay hundreds if not thousands of dollars a year to maybe break even? Ironically this actually gets worse if the volatility gets better because right now you can consider mining to be a risk-based investment.  If volatility falls it makes selling on a high more difficult thus reducing mining incentive further as difficulty continues to rapidly rise. 
4. Blockchain size, it's freaking huge after just 5 years. If Bitcoin continues to gain new users then blockchain size will grow at some exponential rate. It can already take days to synchronize at initial download and nobody wants to wait that long before they can actually begin to really use it.
One proposed solution to the mining problem is to have miners increase fees but this could be an issue because it undercuts the "Bitcoin = no fees" message.
One proposed solution for blockchain growth is to simply cut blocks out of the client synch but if Bitcoin is more widely adopted then you have to keep making the cutoff date closer and closer to the present. Also if the blocks go away completely that undercuts the "Bitcoin is completely traceable" message. If somebody stores the full blockchain but it's not stored in the peer clients then that undercuts the "Bitcoin is fully decentralized" message.
What would end Bitcoin is failure to solve issues like this, either because someone else solves them first or because they turn out to have no workable solution.

I've been wondering at the use of "weary" recently. I've seen that in a lot of different places on the internet. Is this some new spelling of "wary" that I am not aware of or what?
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:11:21
I don't think I can answer that. What I do know is that the protocol has inspired people to work on new kinds of decentralized protocols and that there are people much smarter than I am working on the Bitcoin development team. I would guess wider adoption could reduce volatility, maybe you could change the reference client to be more like a Freenet node where each node is somehow seeding the blockchain and difficulty could be adjusted so in some manner it can both rise and fall instead of just go in one direction.
That could be helpful but I don't know how it would be accomplished.
@_date: 2014-02-24 07:27:14
Completely agree. If I were an investor I would avoid Gox like the plague. But...I've been wrong before, and sometimes people make investments that pay off (or not).

Wouldn't law enforcement have the burden of proof?
In other words you are under no obligation to prove anything to them, who cares what they "believe". It's *their* job to prove a case, not yours. I have a lot of difficulty imagining how they could *prove* you obtained coins illegally if you actually mined them. Every instance I have found where coins have been seized due to illegality has occurred due to investigation where the wallet was seized after a person is actively caught in the act of doing something illegal - think localbitcoins undercover purchases from somebody not complying with AML laws or selling with knowledge of intent to commit a crime on the part of the buyer; SR coins seized along with the servers; MtGox coins seized as a result of them not complying with regulations at one point.
I don't think a series of deposits to your bank account is the same thing.

They could be people invested in other coins and are trying to get others to buy into their coins to increase value.
They could also be trying to force the price down to be able to buy at the lower price.

I mine SHA256 coins including Bitcoin at this time. As others have said it is basically a hobby unless you expect BTC to rise to $100,000+ per coin (which I do not).
In my opinion if you want to make money through mining then scrypt is the way to go though with scrypt ASICs now on the market that may begin to change quickly. Current ASICs for scrypt don't exceed what you can do with GPU mining for less than what the ASIC costs but I doubt that will always be true.
You can always mne SHA256 coins and trade them for Bitcoin and then fiat if the exchange rate rises enough, but I have not seen a mining scenario where ROI on the hardware does more than break even unless you manage to buy the hardware at a greatly reduced cost. If you want to make money off BTC then you should probably buy and trade directly.
All that said, I find SHA256 mining rewarding and fun in totally different way. Buy yourself a few Antminer U1s and have at it. You won't make much of any money but you will support a worthwhile network and make a little bit on the side. Win-win.
Edit: Tl;dr - mine SHA256 or scrypt, then trade for Bitcoin if you're looking for cash growth. Mine SHA256 as a hobby.
Also, I wanted to mention Cex.io, you can buy mining contracts (temp or lifetime) which might give you a better ROI. Lifetime seems to be better for that. Check Ebay for contracts. I recently saw a 5 GH/s lifetime contract for a decent price there, that hash rate is very small for Bitcoin, but it was a lifetime purchase and not a temp contract, plus zero power cost. Some good deals pop up there from time to time.
'Nother edit: make sure to NEVER buy anything Bitcoin related on Ebay using PayPal as the payment method. Keep an eye out for anyone requiring PayPal, and avoid that.

^ This is the pool I use.
Gotta be careful though; Peercoin is having issues there (no blocks found for two months and counting; it has been removed from the multiport for that reason).
Also you can get Auroracoin (sketchy) if you also mine scrypt. 
The pool has never gone down for me though at this point. I only rarely mine on the multiport.
