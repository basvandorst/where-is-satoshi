I like the one that they appreciate our business :-) Of course they do ...

These are not available for online services. We are not a hosting company, but it is a good example - imagine a customer orders a server to be installed and it runs it for 3 months. You pay electricity, and you have many other costs with that (could be OS license, could be connectivity to your provider, support staff, etc.). 
Then the customer just charges the payment back and since this is not a physical item that you can ship and have a proof of shipment and tracking number, you are not going to win the case. 
Actually, PayPal allows up to 180 days for the chargeback to happen, which is also completely insane from the tax point of view in EU (not sure about other countries).

So, having a long history of honest business with online services, PayPal just does not care. 
Scammer made a purchase, consumed the service, made a chargeback with its card provider. This is happening from time to time and we are losing money due to cases like that.
But for the first time today, we have been extra charged 20 USD fee by PayPal for the case because we did not make any objections against the case. 
Usually, we dispute the case, which makes the resolution delayed and at the end the result is always the same - PayPal says online services are not eligible for seller protection, so it returns the money to the buyer. Today, I've decided to say OK, it will end with no money for us anyway, so just send the money to the buyer. Surprise, surprise, this is the worst one can do. You are charged a fee if you do that. Bollocks!

Three reasons at least not to accept cards directly:
- I would mean smaller number of customers
- chargebacks would still not be mitigated
- don't want to touch the card number

I am happy to pay PayPal fees for transactions (and those are significant amounts each month). I am not happy if they allow scammers to just go away, but I get used to it. 
What I am very disappointed with is that I am charged some extra 20 USD just because I was scammed. What is this fee really about?

It is not on eBay, we only use PayPal, not eBay. I'm not here to promote my business. It is nothing illegal, we are fully compliant EU company.

Their usual "if this sale was eligible for seller protection, provide proof that you shipped to the correct address", which is void for what we sell - online services.

And this is exactly why I hope LN will be mainstream. Today, if you don't want to use PayPal, you are most likely to end with another similar company that relies on credit/debit cards. As long is this carding nonsense is mainstream, you don't really have a save option to go to. Maybe some companies are better than others, but the chargeback option on the cards is so flawed that at the end of the day, they are not that much better.
But I agree with you, this is known for ages and we are still using it. It is our fault to create a business that relies on that money. What we can do in the future is to build the business from the scratch without PayPal and cards.

We sell online services, but for those no escrow is even needed, that is not the point (but with PayPal there is no option not to allow chargebacks). 
Even if we sell something for which an escrow does make sense, it can't be worse than PayPal, because PayPal simply does not care, and a paid escrow may or may not care, which is simply equal or better. The escrow might just see you are long term seller and the buyer is unverified, new buyer. The escrow might be interested in evidence other than shipping and tracking information. There is so much more escrow can do that PayPal will never do because they don't care.

Sadly, over 99 % of sales is via PayPal, people do not want to use bank wire and they are not interested in Bitcoin either. Would love to switch to Bitcoin only, but that would ruin the business.
So, this is not about getting fiat money. This is about consumers not willing to leave PayPal. Frankly, the consumer does not see the fee paid to PayPal and if something goes wrong, the consumer is protected. PayPal just convinced the consumers by this and thus forced businesses to use them. We are not strong enough business to be able to leave PayPal. Sadly.
And to be honest, this is why I am so much supporting Lightning Network. If we ever manage to change the status quo, it will be awesome and LN is our first chance.

Not eligible for selling online services.
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:15:16
Probably due to the fact that it can't be worse :-)
Honestly, the buyer does not communicate for about 2 weeks now, still our fault according to PayPal. 
With PayPal, if you don't have a physical item that you can ship and get a tracking info for, you can't win the case. 
With any reasonable escrow service, you could have at least some chance.

They pay for the service, they consume the service and everyone is happy. No chargebacks.

Yes, just like Bitcoin, just faster. But more importantly, hopefully because of lower fees and greater speeds, mainstream. Bitcoin is usable for this already, just lacks the mainstream adoption. LN is a chance to go mainstream, or at least closer to it.

Those are just some of factors that prevent mass use. But you know it already - even if you really were here for 18 days, you would notice scaling debate. You know that if everyone started to use Bitcoin for all their daily payments now, it would not work. And you know that there are more reasons like that it will take a lot more time to get all the infrastructure ready for the common consumer to get easy access to Bitcoin as well as to be able to spend it easily. You know that.

During last couple of weeks, we had several opened cases by PayPal, we disputed them all and neither ended with extra fee, so that is why I expected this to be related to my new decision. 
But you are right, it might be just something new, I do not really know.

Yeah, my favorite situation was when we had a customer to pay 1000 USD, but earlier that day our account was frozen without any reason (something like "Your account has not been reviewed for very long time, please send us documents we already have to unfroze your account..."). Took us 3 days to be able to accept payments again. The customer never came back.

Say I wanted to create a new distributed and decentralized blockchain but without PoW mining involved. I've learned about PoS systems and that they face problem called nothing at stake. 
In this video called [Nothing At Stake Explained In 4 Minutes ]( I have learned that the problem occurs when two different nodes are allowed to create a block and both did so, thus creating a fork. 
My question is whether the problem would still be present if there could not be a situation in which two nodes are allowed to create the next block - i.e. if it was guaranteed that in the entire network only one node was selected for the next block creation.
