Yeah but if that car that hits you tomorrow doesn’t kill you, you’ll be pretty bummed if you have to skimp on your medical care because you weren’t making money.

Yeah but what if you regret not making $ whole you could?

If you have free time, take up a hobby or volunteer work or take classes at a community college. Find some interests, they’re out there. Especially if your job isn’t compensating you to waste away. If you don’t have the desire to do anything special, you might still find happiness doing things that don’t necessarily go anywhere. I used to have a bunch of hobbies when I wasn’t working the way I do now (pretty much around the clock). Wish I had the time/energy now.

Was it hard adjusting? If your job became the most significant thing in your life, quitting the life isn’t just quitting a large income, it’s quitting a social group and lifestyle.

I’m not optimistic. My suspicion is that unless you get very lucky, no one will pay you exorbitantly to do something that doesn’t suck. But I may be totally wrong. I see a lot of folks who made it doing what they love. The problem is I also see a lot of people who went for what they love and are now struggling/unhappy.

Should I quit my high paying job because it sucks the life out of me? Or do I maximize $/hr while I can and try to retire early?

In my early 30s. In finance. Almost feel like the money would even out if I didn’t need the antidepressants drugs and hookers just to get to the next day. 
That said, money solves a lot of problems, and once you’re in that circle, all the people you know are doing the same thing and your expenses rise up with your income. Would suck to suddenly start from the bottom again after working so hard to claw my way here. 
What was the final push you needed to say f it and start over?

How do you pay if you use a hard wallet? Bring a computer?
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:30:16
Yeah I tried to do that and missed the low. Ragrets.

r/gatekeeping Dude you’re not the oldest person on Reddit, calm down. “Oh my god, you like action figures??? In 10 years, you’ll see how childish that was!” Ok... Also, some old folks like to join in the fun. Life is hard and shitty for most of us, why not enjoy the things you can? I guarantee some people who enjoy the slogan HODL are surviving in the world better than you are and/or are older than you are.

If you focus on the space in front of the cart it goes backwards, if you focus on the space behind the cart it goes forwards.
