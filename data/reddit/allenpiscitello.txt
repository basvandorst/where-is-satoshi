Why are you assuming transaction fees are the same in that case?  With Gigablocks, transaction fees drop to marginal cost of including in a block.
I don't want to do it for a month, just stick a backup of my family photos in the blockchain, so it's a 1 time hit of a few gigs.  Surely it's cheaper to pay a 1 time transaction fee than pay for storage for a long time.
Does this now mean that Bitcoin is more useful because I now have co-opted the blockchain to store my data rather than for transactions?

You don't know this.  You have no clue what the fees would be in such a scenario.  If I have to pay $1 per Bitcoin transaction, it's still so much better than the alternatives, I still do it.  I might cut out tipping some random guy $.25 in that case, but my utility remains near constant.


I did not say that.  I said they stop sending the most marginal transactions.  If someone is using Bitcoin exclusively for marginal cases, losing them really doesn't matter, anyway.


I am not advocating keeping it forever.  However, with 1 MB transactions, we still have the possibility of daily settlement for hundreds of thousands of users.  Or monthly settlement of several million.  If we ever achieve that level of adoption, it will make a very compelling case for increasing it.


I disagree on this fundamentally.  Money exists primarily as a store of value that is highly liquid.  I can send Bitcoin without using the blockchain, so saying I can't send it is wrong.  I'm not terribly concerned that I have a small amount of money on ChangeTip, for example.
If your concern is about what will happen when we have hundreds of millions of users - let's cross that bridge when we get there.  But we are nowhere close, and far bigger problems need to be solved first.

I agree it's hard to predict.  Which is why predicting a crisis is silly.
If Bitcoin is truly superior (which I believe), then fees will increase considerably.


I agree that they will start at the margins, as outlined in my post.  


This is incompatible with Bitcoin being so wildly successful that people are willing to pay significant fees to settle transactions on chain.
I agree people will move to alternatives.  It will happen slowly and gradually.  Improve the experience for transactions with wrong fees, and the pain goes away.

Having one currency that can do multiple things is far better than trying to pick the best use case for everyone.  Regardless if it's Bitcoin or not.

Alt-coins directly compete with Bitcoin.  But now it makes sense why you think that.  Sure, it's good for the overall economy, but bad for Bitcoin, except possibly as an experimentation ground where Bitcoin could take the best and tested ideas.


True, but that does not make them any more of a threat to Bitcoin.  Sidechains eliminating that threat, as any innovation or experimentation can occur without diminishing value.

Walk me through this.  What are the alternatives?  What costs are people willing to incur now to do this with Bitcoin?  What costs exist with the alternatives?
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:31:17
The key is not the orphan rate, but the advantages one might have in one pool vs. another for orphan rate.  Say one pool has an orphan rate of 5%, and another has 15%, but the overall rate is 10%.  If the entire network equally is penalized from orphan rates, miners incur some costs, but it really doesn't matter, it's equal, no one has an advantage.  It's a cost of doing business.  The key happens when someone has an advantage from a lower orphan rate.  In the 15 vs 5 case (completely fabricated), you have a significant difference in income.  You'd be a fool to mine with the 15% orphan rate pool.  So you migrate to the 5% one, increase their advantage, and centralize mining more.
@_date: 2015-06-20 04:14:17
You too!
We can agree to disagree, but at least this has been civil.
Think the Blockstream conspiracy is a bit overblown - seems more likely it is people who came together over a common cause than a bunch of people corrupted.  They all agree on what Bitcoin's most important properties are, and many others do not.  Maybe it's time for a divorce.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:31:43
That shows the amount today.  What about with 1 minute block targets that you are proposing.  What would the orphan rate be then?
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:58:34
Fees are not fixed.


They are low today because of central planning where a priority sets relay defaults, and people are lazy and don't change them.  The fee, in a truly free market, moves toward the marginal cost, which for a miner, is not high in most cases.
Assuming revenue for miners stays constant is incorrect.  There is no guarantee that transaction fees completely replace that income.  We end up with less security then (at less cost), and there's no right answer for security here.  Though, if the incentives are not properly aligned, you'll see miners drop out.  Marginal cost of including transactions does not change in that case, but security drops.
What calculation are you using for calculating the marginal cost to miners of including a transaction?  Since many miners include transactions with 0 fees, it seems to me this number is extremely low, far lower than the $.0024/KB default fee that exists today.

Failure to investment into unprofitable areas that aren't sweet spots of Bitcoin is a good thing!  Malinvestment is bad, let's promote use cases that actually work.  I fail to see how that's an issue.


Bitcoin has had nearly free transactions since it's inception.  Where are all these use cases?  Why aren't they here now?
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:40:39


There will be a balance of size vs. price for miners for maximum revenue.  An actual fee market will help better predict that and allow some help in letting users decide expanding the block size.  I do agree this is one of the more powerful arguments for expanding the block size - people move to alternatives and miner revenue drops lower than it could have been if you make a lower fee and raise the number of transactions.  Holders will have an incentive to make sure this is a part of the trade-offs.  But it's essential to get that fee market.
Bitcoin will have a difficult time being all things to all people in it's current form. Expanding the block size does not change that.  It just changes what problems it solves and which ones it doesn't.  My philosophy is Bitcoin's most critical role is to be different than the alternatives in the most meaningful way possible.

In the event Bitcoin Core stays at 1MB, and XT takes off, XT is an alt-coin.

I want Bitcoins to be more valuable.  Simple as that.  They only become more valuable if they provide more value.  Alt-coins are certainly a threat, but if that same "threat" can have all the benefits without the competition of an alternative currency, this is a great thing.

What is the crisis there?  These guys are sticking to the Bitcoin they actually support.  I don't see what the crisis is.


Why is this any of your concern?  Seems to me they are big boys and can look out for themselves.


I think you must have a fundamental misunderstanding about how open source software works.  There is no need to vet committers.  Many of the committers of Bitcoin are unknown.  What matters is the merits of their pull requests, which will always be subject to debate and scrutiny.  Trusting developers based on name alone is a completely foolish action.


I doubt any of the key participants think anyone is trying to kill Bitcoin.  They just have different visions.  I do agree that pushing this change, even without consensus, is a rash action.  My hope is Gavin is simply pushing the XT project on a node basis to simply see how much support there is, and he wouldn't think if actually releasing this into the wild unless there was considerable consensus.  I could be wrong on this one.  His actions do seem a bit dangerous, but I believe he's playing an uncommitted game of chicken, where he will swerve at the last minute if the others have not.  I could be wrong, but that's my hope.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:22:22
So low-fees isn't the only factor.  These are all competing trade-offs.  A low-security, low-fee competitor is complementary to Bitcoin rather than being a challenge.  I welcome such alternatives.
Waiting vs. not waiting depends a lot on what you think will happen.  If it really be a crisis, then not waiting is a better approach and you can take more risk.  If there is no crisis and we just have gradual pain, then waiting can be a bigger preference.  Gavin and Hearn have not made convincing points on why this is so time critical and essential to happen far beyond any serious pain happens.
Changing the block size in face of crisis introduces no more risk other than coordination issues than way ahead of time.  The technical risk from a bug is quite low.  It's a pretty easy change.  If there was serious issues happening now, it would be pretty easy to get out soon.  The question is if those problems would cause any permanent harm.  I'm failing to see where that would be.  Perhaps it might scare some VCs.

Thanks for posting this.  I'd like to address a few of the issues you bring up.


This is a continuum.  The more people who are able to watch, the less miners need to be trusted.  Does it stop it?  Probably not.  Does it make it less sound?  I think that is always the case when it's more difficult to have a full node.


This is really dependent on mining centralization.  The fewer that control transactions mined, the more easily it is to censor transactions.


In a hard for that is backward compatible, it certainly opens that door a lot more easily.


Depends on security.  If no one funds miners, once the reward drops, the network becomes trivial to attack.
Open source does not do anything, much like decentralized does not do anything.  They are both means to an end.  The open-source side means it's auditable, but again, unless you are running a full node, you have no idea what rules others are enforcing.
In short, my best guess on how a 20MB fork works out if it was widely accepted, would be it wouldn't change things *too* drastically, although mining centralization is the greatest worry.  A far bigger concern is when kicking the can down the road removes incentives to actually scale Bitcoin, and then we go to a 400MB fork next.  It's a continuum, and there's not a single straw that breaks that camel's back, but we do see things start to change fundamentally the further this is pushed.

@_date: 2015-06-01 01:27:11


So why do you think Bitcoin is popular?


This is untrue.  When congestion occurs, the cost to send money goes up.  Their ability is still there.


No congestion simply means that demand equals supply here.  In this case, there still is sending of transactions, just at a rate consistent with availability.  You equate "using Bitcoin" with sending transactions.  I use Bitcoin every day without sending a single transaction.  My use of Bitcoin is unaffected by the transaction rates.  I think you might be looking at too narrow of a view of what it means to use Bitcoin.


I wish we would have had this pain earlier and would have caused innovation.  But people did not use Bitcoin in 2009 because of merchant adoption.  They did so because they believed in the principles of Bitcoin.  Those have not changed.


I agree, although it's not entirely obvious and might be wrong.  Other solutions may have developed on top of Bitcoin.


I think what you are viewing as the danger is far different from what I am.  Maybe you can outline what actual problems you are seeing as part of the crisis.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:16:11
This argument assumes that the number of transactions correlates to value.  Consider a case where someone decided to spam satoshi's for whatever reason everywhere.  Are you saying this is more useful than a situation where 100,000 people were sending the equivalent of $10,000,000 every day, because it takes up more space?  If someone spammed the blockchain with backups of their family photos and a miner included them, it makes Bitcoin more useful to everyone else?
@_date: 2015-06-01 03:12:13
I don't see how they can't be compared.  They are costs of joining the Bitcoin network.  People are willing to pay significant fees to do so.  That tells me there is significant value in being a part of it.  The fact that they pay these fees shows me there is a tremendous amount of room for transaction fees to rise without hurting utility.
I wouldn't want to increase any more than necessary.  The market would decide.  The goal is not to cause fees, but to show that fee increases alone are not a cause for concern.
But tell me, what are the use cases you feel are something where Bitcoin is vastly better than the alternatives, but would no longer be so if the transaction fee increased?  Try to be specific as possible.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:36:46

@_date: 2015-06-09 00:49:22
I'd like to think I'm not delusional, but I'm certainly open to hearing your side.
First, what are you defining as "high fee"?
I do agree, if the fee rises high enough that alternatives start becoming a viable option, it's reasonable to consider a rise.
I do think you are overvaluing the importance of "commerce" of an application, rather than as "money".  I don't think Bitcoin (at least currently) does commerce very well.  BitPay's self-released numbers show that it's not a very compelling point of Bitcoin and there really isn't that much to drive away.

You are missing the economics on this... badly.  Sadly, this is the reason why much of the logic behind the increase is so misguided.
Miners can't really "choose the fees they want" without cartel like behavior and coordinating any block that includes too little fees (and even that can likely be gamed).  Miners that pass up transactions with fees that are above their marginal costs of inclusion will have those transactions included by a different miner.  This means those pools become less profitable, and lose hashpower.  So no rational pool would ever skip transactions above their marginal cost, and if they do, they are at a severe disadvantage.
You are correct that marginal costs of mining roughly equate to revenue.  You are conceding that we could end up with a very insecure blockchain when you are counting on most miners to drop out due to no revenue.


This is precisely the problem, without transaction revenue in the long term, security drops tremendously.  Miners could potentially collude to have an orphaning strategy of punishing those who include low fee transactions, though that strategy seems possible to game.
There really is no reason to expect fees given the cost structure of including a transaction in a block, to rise.  With no scarcity on the block size, we are at marginal costs of inclusion, which is quite low.
You never answered my question, does stuffing 1GB of my personal photo share into the blockchain increase Bitcoin's value for everyone else who now must store this data, since I paid a small fee to the miner who mined it?  Where does the value of Bitcoin increase from this kind of spam?

It actually could make a situation where you need to run all 10 implementations to have any idea what's going on.  Say each had it's own unique bug or difference.  First difference occurs, 90% go one way, 10% go the other.  Miners running the bugged version split as well.  Now there's a new bug where implementation  gets hit.  Now it splits off and there are 3 forks.  Continue on until at  the end you have 10 different forks running, assuming no one goes and fixes.
The only realistic solution to accepting coins is to run 10 nodes (or have all 10 nodes process blocks) and be alerted if they ever fork.  That seems worse than having one with some small bugs that don't really matter.

If you increase the number of trains running, you are altering capacity.  I don't see how it is comparable.

Higher fees makes Bitcoin less useful as a transactional currency.  I agree.

Bitcoin is not out-competing those today, barring a few rare cases where you value privacy heavily.

People who tried to freeload had to wait 8 hours.  This also assumed that nothing in the system changed during the time.   The stress test proved exactly that there is no crisis.

So why do you think Bitcoin is popular?


This is untrue.  When congestion occurs, the cost to send money goes up.  Their ability is still there.


No congestion simply means that demand equals supply here.  In this case, there still is sending of transactions, just at a rate consistent with availability.  You equate "using Bitcoin" with sending transactions.  I use Bitcoin every day without sending a single transaction.  My use of Bitcoin is unaffected by the transaction rates.  I think you might be looking at too narrow of a view of what it means to use Bitcoin.


I wish we would have had this pain earlier and would have caused innovation.  But people did not use Bitcoin in 2009 because of merchant adoption.  They did so because they believed in the principles of Bitcoin.  Those have not changed.


I agree, although it's not entirely obvious and might be wrong.  Other solutions may have developed on top of Bitcoin.


I think what you are viewing as the danger is far different from what I am.  Maybe you can outline what actual problems you are seeing as part of the crisis.

The key is not the orphan rate, but the advantages one might have in one pool vs. another for orphan rate.  Say one pool has an orphan rate of 5%, and another has 15%, but the overall rate is 10%.  If the entire network equally is penalized from orphan rates, miners incur some costs, but it really doesn't matter, it's equal, no one has an advantage.  It's a cost of doing business.  The key happens when someone has an advantage from a lower orphan rate.  In the 15 vs 5 case (completely fabricated), you have a significant difference in income.  You'd be a fool to mine with the 15% orphan rate pool.  So you migrate to the 5% one, increase their advantage, and centralize mining more.

Fixed fee per tx?  Per KB?
Ok, so no one pays more than a fixed price.


Yes.  It sounds like you do not.  Say you have a fixed price, and miners want to include more transactions that individuals do not want to pay for.  They set up a payment channel service with users to submit transactions with fees, and give them a refund of the fees.  Super easy to do.
Say that miners wanted higher fees to guarantee inclusion.  They set up the same payment channel in the opposite direction, and charge fees that way.
Or even simpler, they simply require that an extra output is paid to a known address or even "anyone can receive", that gets modified by the miner to their own address, and they pay an extra fee to be included, and it does not look like a miners fee.

I don't see how they can't be compared.  They are costs of joining the Bitcoin network.  People are willing to pay significant fees to do so.  That tells me there is significant value in being a part of it.  The fact that they pay these fees shows me there is a tremendous amount of room for transaction fees to rise without hurting utility.
I wouldn't want to increase any more than necessary.  The market would decide.  The goal is not to cause fees, but to show that fee increases alone are not a cause for concern.
But tell me, what are the use cases you feel are something where Bitcoin is vastly better than the alternatives, but would no longer be so if the transaction fee increased?  Try to be specific as possible.
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:10:17


Go ahead and explain why you think people will not optimize their behavior in the face of higher fees.


But it does not work like this.  I do not make the effort to go to a restaurant and decide the price is too high then leave.  I have a reasonable idea of what that price is, and plan accordingly.

There will be a balance of size vs. price for miners for maximum revenue.  An actual fee market will help better predict that and allow some help in letting users decide expanding the block size.  I do agree this is one of the more powerful arguments for expanding the block size - people move to alternatives and miner revenue drops lower than it could have been if you make a lower fee and raise the number of transactions.  Holders will have an incentive to make sure this is a part of the trade-offs.  But it's essential to get that fee market.
Bitcoin will have a difficult time being all things to all people in it's current form. Expanding the block size does not change that.  It just changes what problems it solves and which ones it doesn't.  My philosophy is Bitcoin's most critical role is to be different than the alternatives in the most meaningful way possible.
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:09:08


Why is it not a market?


This is completely untrue.  You can see past blocks, what was included, what wasn't.  Oh noes, people work with imperfect information.


So how would that actually work?  Miners set a policy of a minimum fee per KB, anything else is ignored?  How do you enforce miners that don't include?  What about miners that contract to give rebates to some users?  What about miners that require extra payments?  There's no way to do this reasonably in a decentralized system like Bitcoin.

You don't know this.  You have no clue what the fees would be in such a scenario.  If I have to pay $1 per Bitcoin transaction, it's still so much better than the alternatives, I still do it.  I might cut out tipping some random guy $.25 in that case, but my utility remains near constant.


I did not say that.  I said they stop sending the most marginal transactions.  If someone is using Bitcoin exclusively for marginal cases, losing them really doesn't matter, anyway.


I am not advocating keeping it forever.  However, with 1 MB transactions, we still have the possibility of daily settlement for hundreds of thousands of users.  Or monthly settlement of several million.  If we ever achieve that level of adoption, it will make a very compelling case for increasing it.


I disagree on this fundamentally.  Money exists primarily as a store of value that is highly liquid.  I can send Bitcoin without using the blockchain, so saying I can't send it is wrong.  I'm not terribly concerned that I have a small amount of money on ChangeTip, for example.

It is trivial to fork Bitcoin and distribute that version if such a change was made that was harmful.
Having multiple versions doesn't really help in the case of consensus, as it could easily generate accidental forks.
The ease of forking Bitcoin Core means the threat of what core developers could do is pretty much nil, even when controlled by some evil corporation.  Bitcoin must be resistant to such attacks.  
The instinct that a bunch of people with similar interests founding a company is immediately harmful is one that should be met with reason for determining if that's actually the case.  I've seen far too much "well, they must have bad motives" from people who have been nothing but positive for the community and truly get the Bitcoin ethos. But let's say they are compromised and evil, that attack is very easily stopped by forking the project and firing them.  We don't need an alternative implementation for that.

Currency tends to converge, not diverge.  Niche networks will exist, but value will be consolidated to a single currency.  Sidechains represents the best of both worlds - single currency, multiple use cases.  That assumes there are no technical obstacles.


It doesn't need to be more valuable in every way.  It just needs to be the most liquid and be good enough for the most valuable use cases.


If it makes more people able to solve real problems using Bitcoin, it makes more people trust it and add value.

I'm not sure why you are talking about 1 billion users.  I do not think that there will be 1 billion users (or even 1 million users) that will suddenly want to join Bitcoin in the next few months (or year).  So let's remove those arguments that aren't even relevant.  Everyone who wants to use Bitcoin will easily be able to for quite some time without introducing any risky changes.
I am failing to see the crisis.  Having half a million regular users still allows for settlement several times per week.  In the short term, that will serve the current and near-term user base just fine.
Feel free to let me know where I'm wrong on this one.
Remember, my argument is not that the limit should be eternally set in stone, but that there is no crisis, therefore making rash actions that do not have consensus are extremely dangerous.

Removing a limit that serves a very necessary purpose with no answer is not really a wise thing to do.

By their nature, marginal transactions are only barely better than alternatives and have very little impact.

What matters is the merits of their pull requests, which will always be subject to debate and scrutiny.  Trusting developers based on name alone is a completely foolish action.


I doubt any of the key participants think anyone is trying to kill Bitcoin.  They just have different visions.  I do agree that pushing this change, even without consensus, is a rash action.  My hope is Gavin is simply pushing the XT project on a node basis to simply see how much support there is, and he wouldn't think if actually releasing this into the wild unless there was considerable consensus.  I could be wrong on this one.  His actions do seem a bit dangerous, but I believe he's playing an uncommitted game of chicken, where he will swerve at the last minute if the others have not.  I could be wrong, but that's my hope.

Any Bitcoin that exists on the regular network and can be moved to a "more valuable" network has a minimum value of the value it gets when transferred - preserving it's value, even if the other network takes off.  Whether it's on the Bitcoin main chain or a sidechain, it doesn't matter.  Obviously there are security concerns with merged mining and the like, I am only assuming a perfect case where such issues are resolved.
One clueless professor does not make any good argument.  I guess I should sell because Paul Krugman hates Bitcoin too, and he has a Nobel Prize!

Not sure why 7 billion is relevant.  How many Bitcoin users are there?  You are also neglecting that many Bitcoin users will only operate a full node occasionally.  I'll turn mine on and download the whole block chain if I was receiving a large payment, for example, but might otherwise leave it off.

So low-fees isn't the only factor.  These are all competing trade-offs.  A low-security, low-fee competitor is complementary to Bitcoin rather than being a challenge.  I welcome such alternatives.
Waiting vs. not waiting depends a lot on what you think will happen.  If it really be a crisis, then not waiting is a better approach and you can take more risk.  If there is no crisis and we just have gradual pain, then waiting can be a bigger preference.  Gavin and Hearn have not made convincing points on why this is so time critical and essential to happen far beyond any serious pain happens.
Changing the block size in face of crisis introduces no more risk other than coordination issues than way ahead of time.  The technical risk from a bug is quite low.  It's a pretty easy change.  If there was serious issues happening now, it would be pretty easy to get out soon.  The question is if those problems would cause any permanent harm.  I'm failing to see where that would be.  Perhaps it might scare some VCs.

The beauty is congestion will solve this problem very easily.  1MB allows for a considerable amount of transactions with adoption where it is today.  The only way those use cases get moved is if they get outbid.

I don't think it's fair to characterize it as unwarranted.  You just have to look at motivations and what their vision is.  It's vastly different from that of the other core-devs.  Their top priority seems to be wide adoption, and decentralization is secondary.  The other devs are far more concerned with keeping the core layer decentralized and are happy with slow to moderate user growth.  Hearn seems especially concerned with any kind of merchant adoption, given his interest in payment protocols, his history with BitcoinJ as a primary use case for Android when he was at Google.  Hearn has openly mocked libertarians and just comes from a different viewpoint.  So of course his concerns are different.  And to them, a Bitcoin without trivial fees IS useless.  I think they are missing the bigger issue and bigger value proposition.
If there were no ways to do trust-less off-chain transactions, I'd be far more concerned.  I've seen some arguments that if Bitcoin ever reaches the 6B user level adoption, even those solutions fall apart as well.  While I would love to have that problem, I don't see that happening for quite some time, and by that time, an increase would be far less controversial.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:30:49
Limiting the mempool is necessary.  Computers only have a finite amount of memory.  Failure to limit the mempool will just allow nodes to crash whenever a flood of transactions, which is far worse than any other behavior.


I agree.  I don't agree that spamming the blockchain is the best way to do this.  We have payment channels that could easily cover this use case.


This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the mempool.  The mempool should not be considered a safe set of transactions.  The mempool already gets cleared after some time anyway, as transactions expire.  The mempool already gets cleared, already has a limit (memory on the machine will run out), so why not alter the behavior to be better for handling congestion?
I think this comes from a fundamental disagreement of the philosophy of Bitcoin - is it a transaction method, or is it a settlement layer?  If you are expecting Bitcoin to be used to check out at Wal-Mart, I think that's why a big part of this debate comes from.  The proponents of the fork believe this is necessary, and we must scale to support this at any cost.  The opponents disagree that this is even something we should strive for.
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:25:24
Gavin's been the biggest mystery in this one.  To be honest, his actions really have surprised me and I have a hard time making sense of them.  I won't speak to things I cannot possibly know about, so until Gavin sheds some light on his vision, what he finds most important, etc..., we can only speculate.
While Gavin does get a lot of support simply for being Gavin, I agree, a lot of people just want a solution.  This is very similar to those who want the government to do something, anything, in response to a crisis, even if the result doesn't actually help or even makes things worse.  Inaction is inferior to all actions, because at least we tried something.  Emotionally, this is true, but logically this fails.  Doing nothing often times is the best action.
I do think a more reasonable change, such as 2MB would be better taken, however, I am genuinely curious to see how the market responds to congestion.  I'm perfectly fine with seeing congestion exist for a small amount of time, and if it's really bad, taking a temporary action such as raising it a small amount that is far less risk to Bitcoin's core principles.

The scenario you proposed earlier, that everyone needs to get to their cold storage paper wallets.
We have 140,000 transactions processed a day now.  You are claiming it could take weeks or months.  Do you believe that there are several million cold wallets out there with significant holdings that would need take months to access the block chain?  What is your doomsday scenario here?
I'd be very willing to think any use case where someone valued sending a transaction at $1 (in a doomsday scenario, this is very reasonable), could get it done within a day at worst.  But if you have some other assumptions, I'd love to hear.

They will be needed, eventually.  But every time we take away any financial incentive for them to exist, their development will be slower than otherwise.


If the blockchain expands to 20MB, I'd say closer to 5-10 years before this becomes an effective business model.  Especially since the expectation once we hit 20MB congestion would be to expand again.


Again, you are assuming crisis.  If there was an actual crisis, I'd agree, we probably kick the can and hope we get it right later.  You are recommending we give free food to obese people rather than say implementing a tax on obesity as a solution.


If 20MB blocks had no downsides or trade-offs, this is a fine idea.  Unfortunately, there are trade-offs.

There's a real crisis for those who only can sell Bitcoin as a "cheap payment method".  Imagine trying to sell to merchants and explain the benefits of accepting Bitcoin when there would be fees equal to credit cards.  The only thing left is fraud protection.  Rather than acknowledge the limitations of Bitcoin, it's easier to just try to make changes, and secondary concerns like privacy and decentralization can take a back seat.  After all, you can afford to run nodes, and can charge a service for running them.

Splitting to serve different purposes is fine, IMO.  Bitcoin can stay true to its principles of decentralization and sound money while centralized forks can exist as a compromise for those who demand it.   Value will come from what people prefer to hold, not what they prefer to transact with, and switching between a savings layer (Bitcoin) and a "checking" layer with Bitcoin XT might actually work out.
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:07:30
It's probably the opposite.  Large holders tend to be early adopters who believe in the core values of Bitcoin, while the new adopters are desperate for something to make the price potentially go up after stagnation.

In Hearn's view, that IS extremely broken.  Hearn's vision is vastly different than that of people like And yes, a lot of casual, toy use cases of Bitcoin will not work anymore the way they have previously worked, just like Satoshi Dice wouldn't work now, or tipping via blockchain doesn't work now.

The people still get the benefits of Bitcoin through trustless layers built on top.  The alternative is a completely trusted system which is much closer to today.  Unless the blockchain scaling problem is solved, we must choose one of these two fates.
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:15:00
Since 99.99% of the population isn't even interested in Bitcoin right now, I find that to be a fine solution for some time.  Once that changes, we can actually discuss things.
I also fail to see the problem in having people use auxiliary layers that are trustless with a trustless base, as an alternative to a completely trusted base level that is more accessible.  We already have banks and central bankers that can provide that.  Bitcoin is the only game in town that provides the decentralized and trustless bottom layer, and if that changes, it offers no value proposition over the old trust-based models.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:01:13

@_date: 2015-05-31 22:32:16


I think you are assuming the main value from cryptocurrency is low fees.  I think this is wrong.  Decentralized consensus is extremely expensive and will always be outcompeted by centralized services.  Even centralized cryptographic solutions.


It's possible that an alternative exists, but it suffers the same trade-offs of Bitcoin, barring some breakthrough in blockchain technologies.  But even in this case, this starts breaking into the "obvious improvement" and consensus can be grained very easily, especially when there's an example of what trade-offs exactly occur.  I'm not in the camp of "don't change it ever", but "this isn't a crisis, so let's not treat it like one".


This depends greatly on how the two differ.  You cannot scale without making trade-offs.  If the trade-offs exist, Bitcoin would offer something unique.  Perhaps Bitcoin2 requires a great deal of trust and only can be run by a handful of entities.  In this case, Bitcoin offers a unique value proposition, much like it does today when competing against fiat.
I think a large portion of this differing opinion is the source of value of the Bitcoin network.  Curious about your thoughts of this:

One reason there are none of those solutions is there no financial reason to build them now.  You already can do exactly what you need on-chain, why go off?  It's trivially cheap, you can expect to pick up fractions of pennies as fees to get people to use them?  Increasing the block size removes the incentives (or at least many of the incentives) for those things to exist.


I really don't care too much about making a bad impression on people who are getting virtually no value out of Bitcoin.  They'll come when there's value.  This merchant is not accepting Bitcoin.  They are accepting dollars and having a processor deal with a customer who wants to use a different currency.
Early adoption phases are riddled with rough around the edges use cases while the kinks get worked out.  It is essential those kinks get worked out BEFORE mainstream adoption starts, not after.  Kicking the can down the road not only delays solving these problems, but actively discourages it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:58:31

Orphan rate of individual miners is a significant cost.  The lower your orphan rate, the greater your profit (all things being equal).  When you increase your risk of being orphaned (compared to other miners), you lose profits.  Centralized pools can minimize orphan risk because they have significant hashing power and will know about their own blocks first without any propagation delay.  This allows them to continue mining on their own chains before anyone can validate.
With closer blocks, the propagation delay remains the same, but the expected time between blocks decreases.  This also increases the likelihood that a block will be found during propagation delays.
Miners that point to smaller pools will lose out, and will have a great incentive to point to bigger pools, even if the pools implement policies that are something they disagree with (blacklists, etc...).  Peter Todd explains this far better than I can, so if you still want more, I can point you to a few explanations from him.
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:06:16
I'm not certain this is the driver for the increase.  It seems to me that those that are drawn to certain parts of Bitcoin's usefulness, mainly its ability to do cheap transactions, are threatened.  This harms a lot of the big players, who's value proposition to customers is based around Bitcoin being a cost-effective alternative to credit cards.  To them, Bitcoin is cheap transactions.  And congestion is taking that away, and anything that does not facilitate cheap transactions is a threat.  You have the other camp, that believes in the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and any changes to that is a threat.
You also have a lot of non-technical folks who do not truly understand the trade-offs or implications of doing nothing or acting.  To them, bigger is better, and everything else is lost.  I do think there is a misconception that if somehow the limit was increased, that swarms of people would now flock to Bitcoin to join in.  However, the fact this hasn't happened yet without this being an issue so far, makes me really question that logic.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:45:50
Times change.  You can try living in the past, or adapt.  This has happened before with very minimal impact without having to compromise the core values of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin cannot just scale at the wave of a wand.  If Bitcoin could support every transaction ever needed without cost, I'd love it.  Unfortunately, there are constraints in the real world.  It's a matter of choosing priorities at that point.

A split isn't too disastrous if it's clear there are two different networks.  There's no reason to think that the split would result in this kind of unclear outcome.  There's a slight flaw in Gavin's proposal which makes the new network susceptible to being outrun in the long run, but I've addressed it here: 
The network effect will certainly be harmed, but as long as there is sufficient liquidity and converting is frictionless, it's not that big of a deal.

This is just blatantly false.  I have used micropayment channels as early as 2012.  Name the shortcomings.

This is simply how pricing works.  If milk were free, I might use it to bathe in it, I might use it to water my yard, I would drink some, etc...  But as it becomes more expensive, I (and every other user of milk) starts rationing it in ways that they find most useful.  The same applies to Bitcoin.  I get to decide and compete against all other users what use cases are the worth paying the price of staying on chain.  The market WILL decide this.


I reject that argument that Bitcoin is popular (or at least that it gets any value from this).  But let's say it even was the main reason why people used Bitcoin and was a significant form of value.  If the price goes up too high, then people stop using it at the point it reaches that capacity.  People stop using it, the price drops, and people keep using it again.  Equilibrium occurs.  The concept that Bitcoin is too popular therefore it fails is just ridiculous, which is why I quoted Yogi Berra "Nobody goes there, it's too crowded".
The market will decide the correct fee.  So long as Bitcoin provides sufficient advantages compared to it's alternatives, the price rises until we hit equilibrium.  At that point, alternatives may pop up, and we could see some loss.  I don't think we are anywhere near that point, but in that case, the case for a fork would be far more obvious and more widespread, and we'd have direct evidence for what is needed and what the tradeoffs are, rather than the blind speculation we have today.

I'm not terribly concerned by this.  It may be true that alt-coins do take some market share in this case.  As long as the total pie grows, this is a very acceptable outcome.  It is extremely unlikely that any alt-coin would outcompete Bitcoin overall, and moving low-value, low-security transactions to an alt-coin wouldn't be terrible.  I don't think Bitcoin is harmed by Dogecoin tipping on-chain, for example, and could even be enhanced, if Dogecoin transactions serve a unique purpose and settlement can easily end up on the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-05-31 19:56:42
Separating coins on the forks in this case is not automatic, but it's certainly possible.  All you need is a transaction to succeed on one fork but not the other.  Congestion on the smaller chain fork would easily allow this, as you end up with transactions that never get confirmed and eventually dropped from the mempools, allowing you to "double spend" on the smaller chain by paying a high enough fee to make it in.
I'm confident such services will exist once the split occurs.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:19:56
Transaction malleability is an issue and is being addressed.  There are other proposals that will easily fix this.

@_date: 2015-05-31 02:54:34
The congestion only happens when there is people using it.
Bitcoin as a store of value can survive with very high fees, as its value proposition is incredibly high compared to alternatives.
There are very few use cases of Bitcoin that can survive long term where the only benefit is ultra cheap transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:14:53
I don't recommend setting limits based on fees, but based on principles of decentralization and technical limitations.  The error should be on the side of decentralization, and if it becomes obvious that there are gains and little downside, things can be expanded.  1MB is a known level that is supported and does not introduce any new risk into an already risky system.


This is just the same logic of saying a road won't be used because it's too crowded.  The only way it clogs is if too many people want to use it, and if the argument is no one will use it if its too crowded shows exactly that it is being used.


Walk me through this logic.  What use cases stop being used?  What assumptions are you making?


Bitcoin offers some very differentiating features from other forms of money, and already has significant friction in using.  I'm basing this on fees and time commitment already needed to adopt Bitcoin.  It's already high cost.  And yet we still are here.  A very minor change in this will have little effect, except on the edges.


It does break down at some point.  I don't know if 10kb or 1kb would work.  It might.  It might not.  If we started there and starting hitting congestion, I'd suggest we at least see what happens first rather than changing things.  I do know that 1MB does work fairly well and everything else is a risk.
Your argument that Bitcoin will become so popular no one will use it just doesn't make sense, though.  Congestion can only happen when people are using it.  If people stop using it, then there won't be congestion, and if people are using it, they clearly find it valuable.  So what am I missing in this argument?
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:45:57


So you think Dogecoin or whatever low-fee alt-coin is superior to Bitcoin?


I'd rather not rely on intuition when messing with Bitcoin.


Agreed.  Though replacing won't be instant, and as soon as we start seeing this switch, it's easy to adjust, easy to know the risks, and easy to make that call.  Rather than relying on intuition.


I'm not fundamentally opposed.  I'm fundamentally opposed to introducing risk without much benefit.  When things become more widely known, it's a lot more clear-cut.  If Bitcoin started at 1 transaction per minute, we'd probably be in a better spot today, knowing exactly the trade-offs and impact.
There is no crisis, though.  We'll have some small pains, some trivial use cases will disappear, and we can move on and have a better picture.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:11:30
That's exactly what is happening.  Trying to figure out what a good settling place is without speculation and resorting to calling things a crisis.

There is no way the current model scales indefinitely.

I don't see how you could have infinite milk yet a finite supply.  We are talking purely about pricing mechanisms and marginal utility of items.
If the price of milk went from free to 1 penny per gallon, people might scream "but how will I water my lawn!?  It will cost a penny per gallon!  I can just use water for cheaper!"  Does this somehow make milk less valuable?


I'm not for drawing lines.  There will become a point where Bitcoin could become expensive enough that it's utility is limited and greater growth could occur by lowering fees/expanding and the trade-offs become more obvious.  My point is, we should at least let this occur before presuming it will be some kind of crisis and what will happen.  Trade-offs will change by that time and we will have a better understanding of the situation.  I believe I saw some analysis that showed something like 1-10% of Bitcoin transactions are actually sending significant fees indicating valuable use cases.  If this is true, we have a LONG way to grow.  People will conserve in the face of a shortage, and we will do as we have always done in a market - cut down on marginal demand and still have all valuable use cases covered.

Zero-confirmation transactions are already dead, it's just too many people don't realize it.  It's trivially easy to defeat, even today.
Your breakfast scenario - you do realize that people write physical checks all the time in that scenario.  What keeps people from constantly writing fake checks?  The same can discourage the anti-social behavior of zero-confirm double spends.
You do accurately describe the state today, but the mistake is assuming that fixes won't be introduced or become more widely used.  I described several of these fixes in the article.  You may call it hand-waving, but there is real code out there that already exists.

Each user can set their own mempool constraints.  There is no need for mempool consensus.  Each node can make its own policy independently.


Unfortunately, this is impossible given the protocol of Bitcoin.  This is not already the case, as double-spends on unconfirmed transactions is trivially easy and easily demonstrable.  Relying on a behavior that is trivially defeated will result in losses.  If mempool consensus was possible, we wouldn't need a blockchain.
But I see this is a source of your issues - assuming the mempool is some static entity that is actually a consensus.  It is far from it.

UTXO and mempool are different.  UTXO represents all previously unspent transactions, where mempool would hold unconfirmed transactions.
One of the fear-mongering arguments from Mike Hearn was that mempools would grow unbounded and crash.  This is a trivially easy solution, and the poor design of Bitcoin Core shouldn't be used as an argument to stop this.  You could move some to a database, although it would certainly cause other issues.  Having a mempool that grows beyond the usable amounts of the blockchain serves little value, though.

Yes, it's exceptional, but that doesn't mean it won't make sense when the rules drastically change.  Yes, miners can screen, but I'm talking about the case when miners *want* to include low fee tx's in an "unlimited" or "effectively unlimited" block world.   Some miners can include at different price points.  Those that can include more have more revenue potential, pushing toward centralization at those points.
I'm not talking about the relay network.  The assumption would have to be that every miner has the same marginal costs of including a transaction, and those that bypass the relay fees to include low-fee transactions for extra revenue gain when they have lower marginal costs than competitors.

@_date: 2015-07-08 02:47:36
Not always.  If you have sufficient hashing power, or aligned hashing power, you can actually benefit from larger blocks and slower propagation.  And it comes down to does every miner have the same marginal costs of including a transaction?  It's very unlikely this is the case.  The ones with the lowest marginal costs are likely the bigger ones (they don't need to propagate to themselves!), thus, they can include more transactions and make more.  This leads toward centralization pressure as miners leave smaller pools for bigger ones that offer such benefits.
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:10:56
What makes you say the market doesn't think it's too low?  How could you possibly come to that conclusion?
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:38:49
Sending transactions to miners directly - the larger ones that can advertise their nodes.  I know several pools that allow you to submit transactions directly.
Why big over small?  If I can send my transaction to 90% of the hashing power which would be say 10 pools, the last 10% of small miners aren't really needed to send my transactions.  They also have a bigger orphan risk of including my transaction, so their marginal cost of including x KB of transactions is higher.
Need to have soft-fork rules to orphan miners who accept low fees in this case.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:01:11
We aren't seeing it happen because there is a block cap and relay limits.  We also have a lot of sub-optimal miners who are missing even easier ways to make extra money.  They'll grow more sophisticated with time.  We have 2 miners at &gt;40%.  They coordinate efforts a little, and it's trivial.  And even if they don't coordinate, 22% means you don't need to propagate to a large portion of the network.
lol pwuille = armchair FUD.
Either way, it's highly unlikely that every mining pool has the same marginal cost of adding a tx, and those with lower ones matter.  If including all the transactions, no matter how low the fee is the goal, and mining centralization isn't a concern, I can see how that makes sense, but you basically are admitting you care so strongly about no/low fees, you'll sacrifice mining decentralization for it.

Yes, the probability of the new chain getting a block next is equal to Hashpower%(New), and the old chain is Hashpower%(Old), thus in the 75/25 split you see 3x faster.  Though it's not deterministic - it's only a probability.  The new chain *might* not find the next block- the old chain might (that happens 1/3 of the time).
The risk depends greatly on the actual hashpower split and the current state.  The hashpower split is dynamic and changes with conditions.
Miners who are the *earliest* to mine on the new fork are at most risk, and those who mine after it is sufficiently ahead have less risk.  Of course, this all assumes that NewHash% &gt; 50%.  If this becomes false, the old chain will surpass the new chain.  That's another danger of having a compatible fork.  While miners may want to support a fork - if the price of the old chain ever becomes greater (perhaps some large holders dump the new chain, as promised on sites with stake voting), then miners have a great incentive to revert to the old chain.
So no, the risk is hardly ever 0, even after weeks.  Of course, I would expect a forked coin to implement some kind of checkpoint pretty soon after to avoid this risk (assuming they are responsible).  Though, their actions in designing the fork in such a dangerous method make me question that.
@_date: 2016-02-10 15:26:51
Yes, once a chain is passed by 6 blocks, it becomes safer for miners.  However, miners are needed to take those chances *before* that point, and at which point, they'll have a significant risk.
This is why miners should not even consider mining on a new fork that can be orphaned until they can realistically expect 90%+ of the hashpower to be on their side.  Or they can use an incompatible fork to avoid this risk.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:11:17
That's actually not quite right.  Because you could beat it right away (2 blocks before 1), or later (3 blocks before 2), or even later (4 blocks before 3).

The minority chain sees the majority chain as invalid blocks in the event of a hard fork.  Therefore it never gets orphaned.

After 28 days, it gets murkier - the hashpower could increase or decrease, there's no way to know.   I provided a table of many different hashpower results, feel free to use the values you expect.  But if you expect a large amount of hashpower to change versions in the grace period, it would be far safer to just require that amount of hashpower to trigger the wait period.  Or better yet, use a non-backward compatible hard fork, such as modifying the header or adding a hard fork bit.

The minority chain does not get orphaned.  It may be ignored by the majority chain and majority chain nodes, but it's not forever orphaned.  Miners who mine on that chain would do so because they want to mine the minority chain, not because they expect to be ever on the majority chain.  However, they may get some extra coins that will be valid if the majority chain ever gets orphaned.
The memory pool backlog is a solved problem.  Transactions are just evicted from the mempool.

There's no "losing" chain.  There are two chains that continue (and sometimes one that gets orphaned).  If the issue is that 95% would move to that chain, then it should activate based on those numbers.  That would be much safer.
If the minority really has it in their interests, what is the harm in waiting until they have fully upgraded and shown support?
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:16:30
That's not what orphaned means.  All nodes that follow the old rules will continue to acknowledge the old chain.
You've been lied to about how hard forks work.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:11:35
It depends how long the attack is sustained.  An eternal attack will *always* get lucky at some point and pass up the old chain.  If you flip coins long enough, you'll eventually get 1 billion heads in a row.  It may take trillions of years, but it will happen.
But the odds of the attack do drop with time - my number shows the odds of a chain that is initially 1 block ahead getting orphaned.  This is what a miner who must choose to mine a forked block must decide is worth the risk.  If he mines the original chain, even if he supports the fork, he'll end up with coins on both sides if the minority chain temporarily overtakes the majority chain.
@_date: 2016-02-12 15:15:51
When one side effectively drops everything it did and rejoins the original chain, that's a much bigger deal.


It's not freak luck, it's a very reasonable occurrence.  And it gets even worse when the hashpower isn't actually 75% (remember, it activates after 75% of the last N blocks vote for it, THEN a 28 day grace period).  It could activate prematurely due to good luck with 70% or less.
That number I gave in the simulation is the odds that the "judas block" and all that grow on from it are orphaned.
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:56:54
I just spoke with about this, and he brought up a really interesting point.  You cannot use block height, you have to use total work.  This means that if there is exponentially increasing hashpower over time, it *is* 100% of the time of an orphan.  This is because the orphaning happens based on total work.  Say the minority chain is 10 million blocks behind.  The amount of work done in the last 3 months is considerably more than the previous X years.  This means that you only need a small number of blocks to catch up to the majority chain (far fewer than 10 million).  Thus, you never really are truly that far behind, and just need a lucky streak with increased difficulty to cause an orphan.
Now, the assumption of increasing hashpower exponentially may be unsustainable, but it at least gives a better chance to the minority fork than I previously thought.

@_date: 2016-02-10 15:20:05
I'm not sure what you mean by factoring in time.  Time doesn't really add any value to this.
I'm not trying to predict how the hashpower will be divided - that's an impossible task.
Since the difficulty is identical for quite some time after a split, the chance of finding a block on each side is identical to the same hashpower.  There may be 25% of the miners on it, and only 25% of the rewards are found, but 25% split by 25% is the same as 75% split by 75%.
The only way a majority fork succeeds is if it avoids getting unlucky (amount of luck depending on how big a majority it is), or if an amount of hashpower on the majority chain is overwhelming (95% or above is a good threshold - I never got a block more than 3 confirms deep orphaned, and orphan rate was nearly nothing).
In any case, a point of no return fork bit or incompatible change is far preferable for the security of miners who wish to mine a forked chain.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:17:03
Jeff and Gavin are reminded of this all the time.
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:15:18
The first miner's chances go down of being orphaned if someone finds something on his chain first.  This isn't really groundbreaking.  But he has to choose where to mine before he knows what will happen in the future.
Yes, at some point in the future, either the fork has converged, there is a small-ish gap, or a nearly insurmountable lead.  That is, assuming hashpower stays constant.  If the hashpower moves around, it gets more complicated.  If the price of the original chain ever grows larger than the new chain, then the new chain is doomed since miners will return back to that chain.
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:32:48
That represents the risk of a miner getting orphaned who chooses to mine a fork that is already 2 steps ahead instead of 1.  It certainly is less risky to be the 2nd or 3rd miner on a fork than the first!
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:17:38
The problem is "all the txs" is dynamic.  Imagine if there was no tx fee used in relaying, default was 0 fee.  Should miners include "all the transactions?"  What if people just started spamming gigabytes worth of files to backup?  Well, we can't just include all the transactions, maybe miners only include transactions that it makes sense for them to include.
People's behaviors change based on the environment, and without a fixed fee (either a practical limit where miners lose money including transactions due to slow propagation including low fee transactions or just a hard fixed limit per KB) or fixed block size, the transactions that get created will be endless.  
There's also no guarantee the market for transactions ever matches the current block reward.  We simply don't know what that market is because we've never seen a true fee market.
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:11:33
There may be multiple disruptions.  Those disruptions could cause miners to lose faith in the new chain and revert, thus making it worse.


That's not how Bitcoin works.


The majority only refers to miners, as there is no way to really measure the economic impact until after it happens.


There only is one consensus.


Splitting into two coins that sometimes merge back up is "working" as designed when you break consensus.


Nakamoto consensus refers to something very specific, that you are claiming to mean "whatever miners decide".  That's not how it works.

Not 90% chance, there's a 75% chance it finds a block first.


Probability over infinite timespans is a tricky topic and non-intuitive.  The probability of passing up EVENTUALLY is 100%.   Now, the we may have a heat death in the universe first, but it is 100% that eventually a minority chain will get so lucky that it catches up from even billions of blocks behind.  Of course, this case is ridiculous, but it serves a reminder that over long enough time intervals or large number of attempts, even things that are infinitesimally small do happen.  We had 3 winners in the recent Powerball that had hundreds of millions to one odds against it - why?  Because billions of tickets were purchased - it was super likely to occur.  Why is it that hashes are found with infinitesimal odds of occurring, every 10 minutes?  Because there are quintillions of hashes occurring.
Is it something we need to worry about in our lifetime?  No.  But that's why I stopped the simulation if the new chain got 100 blocks ahead.  For most cases of splits that are not nearing 50/50, 100 blocks is sufficient that you can go millions of blocks without the other chain ever catching up, even with lottery-like luck.  For a 50/50 case, it's obviously different - even a chain that is 500 blocks ahead can get unlucky sometimes.
I'm not sure why you are saying it's moving the goalposts, when the original post talked about different hashrates.
It absolutely isn't wrong to say that the new chain gets orphaned 10% of the time.  That's what the math shows, that's what the simulation shows.  It's quite obvious the chance is at least that high (the odds of a minority chain finding 2 blocks before the majority finds 1 is (.25)^2 =   .0625.  The minority chain can orphan the majority chain in an infinite number of ways as well - finding 3 blocks before the majority chain finds 2, 4 blocks before 3, etc... So the probability keeps going up above 10%.
Just because you find the results of such math unintuitive or different than you want does not negate the correctness.  You'll notice that there has been not a single criticism of the methodology used or a flaw in the simulation.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:09:11
How many times are 10+ blocks orphaned?  And yes 49.9% overtakes nearly always when the majority hashpower always mines the longest chain.

The beautiful thing about mining is it's dynamic.  It might be the same people stick to it, but more hashpower comes online.
But we only need a counterexample of SCRYPT miners to see that they switch between chains all the time, whatever is more profitable.  I'd expect the same behavior out of many miners.
