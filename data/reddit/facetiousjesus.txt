Some of the adverts they were running were incredibly well played scams. For instance Mobius had an impersonator that had a website nearly identical as theirs except they were accepting only ETH. Someone that didn't know better than to click the Ad versus the actual Mobius website would've been fooled. I contacted Google and the team at Mobius and they were aware. Google still wouldn't remove the ad. They dgaf as long as they are making money.

Did AJ tell explixitly him to do that? Did he explicitly tell anyone to go harass these families of dead children? 
Scientology explicitly harasses people that try to leave, yet we as a people continue to allow this to happen and they remain tax exempt as a religious ideology... I'm not defending AJ, in fact I think he is a wacko and may even be apart of the controlled dissent.  I'm just saying any dissent to official US govt narrative can now be blanketed under "hate speech" and be silenced. And you nut jobs are okay with this because he hurrr durr said to harass families. You're giving the state/corporatocracy the power to silence any discourse that might negatively impact the state's image to the electorate. It's not about he shouldn't be allowed to speak. It should be about should corporations be in charge of the public's speech and how they view things. Journalism and free thought is being ruined and people like yourself are perfectly okay with this. It's a shame.

Too bad they missed the boat. KYC/AML and institutional investor laws have now made it nearly impossible for the little man to get in on the ground floor of a project. Granted a lot of ICOs were bullshit. I think the VC firms lobbied hard for this. If it weren't for ICO disrupting the VC model I doubt the SEC would've given a shit about crypto for another couple years.  They would've continued the hurr Durr it's a scam narrative.

I’d allow it more so than the current overlords. At least he would perhaps try his hand at the counter Machiavellian strategy. Which is that It will be better to be loved than feared. Overall he seems to have humanity’s best interest at heart, At least somewhat from the interviews I watch. 
May I point you to a real world example of the exact same idea except it happened under our current system of banking/borrowing. The Rothschild family used information, lies, and deceit to essentially garner full control of The Bank of England. During The battle of Waterloo he stationed a runner to report back to England before the military could. Initially it appeared as though the English were going to lose the battle but they didn’t. The runner got to Rothschild 24 hours before govt officials could report to the commonwealth. He started selling his govt bonds which in turn created a panic. Everyone sold their consuls only to have Rothschild buy them all back at a manufactured insane discount. It was a well played scheme I will give them that. Doesn’t make it any less deceitful of a system that he in turn created and has left over century long dynasty that no one questions. 
If you have 4 mins this sums it up well ^

You're still missing the point. I'm not disagreeing that private corps can't do this.. it's just a very fricken bad idea m8. If I said I was gonna jump off a bridge cause I know gravity is a lie and I can fly is it my fault some asshole went and did it? I said I CAN DO IT, I DIDNT SAY YOU SHOULD. Why tf are we ignoring personal responsibility here? That gunman should be held accountable for his actions not some lunatic TV radio show host that is bonkers and says some dumb shit to sell shitty testosterone pills. Are we going to hold dumbass rappers and and pop stars for the bullshit they sell us too, drugs and violence...? Cool didn't think so.  This is just another power grab and I find it to be a flaw in logic to not see the bigger picture here. 
The scientology bit was an example people like yourself seem to ignore. We allow religious institutions, and corporations to get away with this shit, then they are coming for all of our speech. You idiots keep defending a corporations right to do shit soon you won't have the right of freethought, free movement, and free speech cause it will be against the state. State=corporatocracy, at least that is where we are headed in this capitalist system we are in. 4 competing tech firms, who have no reason to work together colluded to silence a man on the exact same day down to the minute. They didn't even site "inciting violence. They cited "hate speech." Now they have the open go to silence anything that is hate speech, doesn't matter what it is and you are defending this why? Besides it wasn't Alex Jones that broke that story it was WikiLeaks. John Podetas emails and their sketchy code words for shit raised the eyebrows of anyone willing to read them. But nahh that's some Russian bots trolling and that's all fake news /s. You guys are nnesr sighted and have an attention span of a gold.fish. Podesta created that narrative to fool everyone and liberals toot the same talking points. Push the narrative from WikiLeaks reveals to Russia collusion.  Smh you're on the wrong side of history.

If only that RuneScape gold got pegged to Enjin Coin and you could claim some of that back. God I hope the day comes where some mid to newish old games join the Enjin network and you can go back and melt items down to ENJ and then buy two pizzas by selling your Christmas snacks.

Just like Mr. Clarence Thomas on the Montsanto case... It seems all our leaders don't understand what a conflict of interest even is. The hypocrisy at all levels and major cases predicates the ridiculous nature of the US government.

The only idea that I’ve seen so far that I can get behind is DAI. The ELI5 of it to me is users deposit (lock up) their ETH and get DAI which is pegged to $1. Now apparently according to a team member I spoke to at ETH Denver they have a 3:1 backing meaning for every dollar of dai they have $3 in ether. Need to do more research but they gave us all dai to use at vendors at the convention. It was seamless too, pretty neat.

Whale buys lots of bitcoin with whale friends. Whales short tf outta Bitcoin futures. Whale Guild sells their collective massive stack of btc 5-7 days leading up to futures closing to send market into downward spiral. Collect on the short, then buy more btc and repeat the process. I don't have evidence of this, it's just obviously simple to do this with futures.

I appreciate the info and pointing me in a direction. Tbh I don't try and claim to know anything about this stuff. Just an easy vector for a small group with a lot of money to make an impact. The scale of that impact I imagine is rather small to negligible, but again I cannot confirm that. But you say "non-institutional" money.. just cause Goldman Sachs didn't approve of crypto trading until recent doesn't mean joe shmo and sally shmender that worked for Goldman couldn't have spent personal money participating in what I am alluding to though right? I'm failing to see how the institutional money point even matters.

Yeah agreed. All very valid points, I just meant it is still relatively early in the evolution of crypto that there are definitely some players doing this.. Not saying it is systemic, or even that it played a major roll in any particular dip, just that yes it does happen. As time goes on and more strong hands come in then yes their bets will be more risky, but right now this behavior is worth it for an extra 5 btc.. at last from an expected appreciation standpoint. That 5 btc could be $100k right there in a few months/years. pennies to some, life changing for many. But yes, make no mistake I realize this isn't as big of an issue as people make it out to be. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 09:12:27
Yes, there are a vast amount of variables to consider regarding this matter. However, I think we might be underestimating the "some maybe even are" part. Personally, if I had the money I would be doing this tactic and arbitrage as a regular strat because it's easy when you have a lot to control things a bit. But you are right it isn't any massive manipulation on a systematic scale, at least not that I am aware of. To say there is no manipulation happening though is a gross misrepresentation of the market imo.

Guys what if you 1) open an LLC, big candle financial LLC^TM 2) you are registered agent so go apply for a business loan for "speculative property investment. 3) buy BTC at 7800. 4) if it crashes, declare bankruptcy on the LLC 5) Maybe it doesn't effect you personally but the LLC with your name on it goes defunct but you good fam? 6) new LLC and try again next market cycle. /s

You say invest as if it might actually appreciate to levels worthy of providing financial freedom. The same people you are telling to invest are prolly the same crowd that bought the ATH when you told them it's the next biggest "investment." The truth is this space is losing site of the original intent of this project. Investment/speculation is now what it's become and that only further serves the banking nature it was intended to destory. *inserts Obi Wan you've become what you vyed to destroy.meme* I agree we are here to make some money, some more than others but what brought me here wasn't $$$ freedom it was the freedom from the $$$.
