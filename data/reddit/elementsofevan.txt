If it isn't secure why should people trust it? What stops you from collecting these bounties or someone else from gaming the system? Wouldn't it be better to have cryptographic keys unlock loot?  
I prefer systems that don't use security via obscurity because their methods have some degree of penetration testing instead of just hoping someone doesn't figure out or decompile your method. If you expect users and businesses to give out real cash there needs to some kind of protection. I would prefer people posted public keys and GPS locations to find a private key and password to unlock the prize. These could be in QR codes to eliminate the need for typing. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:25:48
Which is dumb on it's own. Why not just have a QR code with a private key and password in the cache location? Then the solution is cross platform and truly secure. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:51:05
Yes that would be great. But OPs way of doing it may not be secure. Just hiding how it gets location data is not a sound security practice.

I don't see a problem with having the private key in the cache to unlock the bitcoin. Let the user think it is a password or verification which is totally mainstream. Using weak security measures is just throwing up a hail mary.

Coinbase is basically a bank and has to conform to many of those rules and regulations. It has a multistep verification process and is far from perfect but doesn't just rely on blind trust. 
That is basically the same method I'm talking about but they have you store the private key also while the location has the password to decrypt it. That keeps everyone honest. 
I want to trust you and have this be a fun game and entry point into the community but I need to see behind the curtain or you have to use a method that you could never exploit. You say you couldn't steal the bitcoin but it seems like you have everything required to do so.You have to store a users location and the answer to the question which mean you could spoof the location and have the answer. 
 Users haven't had too many issues dropping off physical geocache loot so far so printing out or writing down a key or password to a key shouldn't be that hard especially considering that it is actual money. 
You or anyone else can pay to have your app audited. If you are using open source libraries and methods much of that auditing can be skipped because you copied and pasted from a larger and better vetted project.

I'm sorry but I've been an almost strictly open source user for a decade and I prefer code that is independently verified or at least has the ability to be . Providing source code is an important part of that. Sure it isn't perfect but I prefer it over taking a stranger's word for it especially when money is involved. No offense. That way you nor any other developers or hackers couldn't collect without going to the location. Do you store the question and answer? Do you have plain text access to the data? What are your monetary incentives?
What I meant is that a person determines a geocache drop and post a public key, GPS location and reward amount to your app and leaves the private key at the drop (via QR or some other method). Without both the information (bitcoin) can't be accessed by anyone. You could develop the app in such a way that you don't have access to the private key and open source it to prove it. Once another person finds the drop they could enter the private key and claim their reward. No need for hidden methods or server side passwords.

I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic or not. 
Security via obscurity isn't a great method of protecting people. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:57:58
Yes, users would need to physically leave a private key. That is the only way I see to prevent hackers or spoofers. 
What I meant about monetary incentive is what is stopping you or your company from taking the bitcoin? Without source code, public oversight, or public/private keys you have a financial incentive and ease of access to collect coin drops unless you have an alternative revenue stream (like taking a cut of transactions). 
Basically from what I understand this app works like a person dropping $10 in a place a telling people where it is. There is nothing stopping you from getting it first and you could even build in a handicap or completely shut out regular users from getting the prize. What I'm suggesting is the digital version of telling a person there is $10 in a locked box that requires 2 keys. The first key is publicly available, the second key is stored in a location and when used together unlock the $10. If the keys are created locally, you have no advantage.  Your method potentially allows anyone to get the $10 without getting off the couch and you aren't confident in it's effectiveness enough to tell everyone how it's done. 
iOS is one thing but Android is a different ballpark. I have root on a few devices and hide it very well from apps that check. I can even root to change certain settings and location and then reboot with no root with the settings still applied.  Even Google's Android Pay can't tell, and there is some serious security work in that service. 
I nor anyone else but you has anyway of verifying that the stuff on your sever is salted and hashed the right way and that it is protected from you even if you open source it.

Why? 
@_date: 2016-01-23 16:59:23
If you open sourced the app and everything but storage of the location and the encrypted answer was done client side there would be very little reason for anyone to worry what you are doing server side including you having to bother with combating location spoofing. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:20:50
Why should you get blocked from reddit for doing so?
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:07:22
I didn't think that was a thing. I am only familiar with geocaching in terms of physical items. As in a hiker brings some loot or log book to a point marks the GPS location and uploads that location publicly for others to find. Wikipedia seems to have the same general idea.
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:16:36
I thought geocaching was mainly for hikers and outdoorsy people so that "prizes" could be hidden from normal people. Even if I'm incorrect stickers or laminated codes could still work.

Because it will do a better job of letting users know that they aren't giving their money to cheaters. OP specifically mentions businesses, why would they want to potentially give away profits for no reward? Would you support bitcoin if no one but the developers knew how security was handled?
At least to me the solution seems simple. Give out GPS coordinates and public keys. Once a users gets there they find the private key which unlocks the reward. This method would open this service up to users on any other OS and rely on tried and true methods of security. For example, what stops OP and Co from taking the loot for themselves? 
Ingress is different because there is no money involved and it was designed to get people to collect data for Google who therefore doesn't have a reason to beat users. There is very minor real world impact if someone games the system. When money is involved the rules of the game need to change
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:15:17
Then why not come up with a solution that is reasonably full proof like using cryptographic keys instead of using a method that isn't cross platform and can be easily gamed without anyone's knowledge?

One US note is approximately 1 gram (Google it). $1M in 100 bills is 10,000 notes. 10,000 grams is around 22 pounds. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 02:13:35
$750!? What am I, made of money?
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:48:48
A million dollars (in hundreds) is only around 22 pounds. Depending on how you stacked it would fit into a large shopping bag. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:14:14
Since my final step was in imperial units and I have a conversion from grams to pounds the step was unnecessary. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 23:04:25
I wasn't disagreeing that $1M is easier than digital currencies just pointing out that it isn't as hard as some would think. There are reasons why more than  25% of all US currency is overseas besides it stability.
