Great, as long as he works for butterfly labs or any other asic company ;) . 
(Yes I know he's not going to work in the Bitcoin space)
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:53:16
hmm works here, just fine.
edit: and no I haven't opted out of anything.

I raised the exact same point a few months back that bad PR could be a massive issue 
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:08:16
Thanks for the positive words they mean a lot especially from somebody who is in my video.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:49:17
Honestly, after Gox the Bitcoin foundation is probably the second worst thing that has ever happened to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:27:14
I gifted them Bitcoin and told them how it will change the Finance industry/ the world etc, long story short some of them are now mining and buying Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:31:46
Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2014-02-09 11:05:19
You know just most of the stuff that you did in your videos are mentioned as feedback in my thread. Anyways that was a little joke. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:10:20
The Barclays  pingit it app uses OpenSSl and there is loads of Bitcoin traders on here who use it so please be aware.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:42:20
I think it's probably the logo that overwhelms it. I will update it on Monday, I already submitted this to the contest plus I think it gets the message across. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 09:58:53
I think it's a good start for someone who was extremely against it at one point. Yes he converts it but he's also pushing for it's acceptance and educates his audience. Another thing you have to remember is that he has to pay his manufactures somehow and currently they don't accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:18:31
One of the worst looking sites I have ever seen.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:32:06
Do the reddit upvotes still count or....?
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:03:33
But, but.. they were the chosen ones especially for scrypt miners :(
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:30:35
In the uk its pretty much instant and normally doesnt take longer than two hours unless your bank is a pain and wontlet you send till the next day. Oh and that 2 hours ibcludes transfers from hsbc to barclays for example.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:01:26
Failure at this point means not gaining mass adoption because that's the next step forward. Bitcoin is extraordinary but to truly realize the great vision of Satoshi we need the world to accept and use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:09:17
My email is not on there and yet I'm getting emails. I assume this not the full list.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:44:34
Are we allowed parts of videos created by different people? e.g a bit of this one 
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:07:59
Here is a new version now with captions and a better logo at the end: 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:08:55
I honestly admire your vison but we have to look at this in a realistic way. I personally believe bitcoin is the future but I don't think that in order for Bitcoin to succeed we need fiat currencies to fail. In the fiat markets there are players at stake that are so much bigger then you can imagine and they won't simply go away or fail. Unless the world agrees that Bitcoin is the future and sees the potential of it as an extra world currency, there is no bright future. The best way of doing this is through more than adequate infrastructure and great pr.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:43:39
It can be a joke but that still doesn't change the fact that bugs within this feature must be fixed.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:18:25
I will put that in the description later today. I thought about doing it in the video but I was worried that it wouldn't look as good since the Apple one doesn't have it in theirs.
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:16:50
Thanks, I will try to pass it on.
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:22:47
Bits sounds cool.. modern and very easy to understand. Great idea
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:03:37
I most probably will and I was actually thinking about mentioning this in more detail within my personal statement when applying. Good luck to you to, It's definitely been a fun ride so far.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:11:51
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:06:09
I thought people might like that ;) I tried to match the words to the videos as much as possible.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:49:20
and they should also not allow things like this  . I'm sure that there is a way of flirting emails and look for keywords like "Hacked" 
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:24:36
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:53:13
well people try the efficient way  and that didn't work so...
@_date: 2014-04-09 16:25:54
What's up with the downvotes?
@_date: 2014-05-20 06:20:55
Actually the mining started after I purchase my computer but the point still stands. I also gave most of the electricity money back.
When it comes to trading patterns etc, it's more that bitcoin taught me how to vaguely understand it and then inspired me to learn more from wallstreet videos, cnbc, bloomberg etc.

Hahah well if you know anyone who has 8 million dollars laying around let me know and we might arrange it for the next superbowl. Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:25:40
Hmm yeah, I will upload a version with names after the contest is over. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:37:04
I think that your point although quite a controversial one is more than a possibility. Just by seeing how your comment, this post and other negative but critical posts are being downvoted shows me that there might be to many people in this community who are naive. On the other hand there are people who are doing their best to spread the word on Bitcoin but you have to wonder if it's enough and sometimes it seems like it isn't.
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:33:02
Yeah, I wonder why maybe they didn't have time.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:56:30
I think that I maybe should have defined what I meant by failure better. I don't think that Bitcoin would be completely destroyed by the press but it won't be as big as everyone wants it be if we don't get our stuff together.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:38:22
It's a shame that we could never ask Steve his thoughts on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:36:52
Hmm, I see your point. Thank You

The ration of downvotes is quite high and it seems like most submissions get downvoted instantly apart from one.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:46:11
I don't believe that the world press is against bitcoin, they are uneducated and that's different. We need to educate the press.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:50:33
First of, I would like to congratulate all of the submissions but I do agree with some people that maybe reddit wasn't the best platform for voting. You can quite easily abuse the system, I mean you don't even need an account to register. That being said I don't think JasonBored has anything to do with it. Jason thanks for taking the time to put this together. Good luck to everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:40:26
Well, TIL....

Hmm yeah that's what I love about the bitcoin community, the diversity.

I wanted to promote my first bitcoin project and the bitcoin community here seemed pretty open to ideas so I joined
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:49:03
The problem is that negative news/articles isn't "almost anything", it's an extremely important way of how people structure their opinion.

Blockchain.info just Favorited my tweet about it which is nice. Thanks for the comment.

Well there is my yearbook quote, however just in case I should probably but bitcoin in brackets ;)

It's a joke that has gotten out of hand but at least it shows us what coinbase must fix. The email ones are ok but things like this where it's text  can be fixed and should be.

It might be a 0 day account but the point is more than fair.

That's probably better they are extremely overpriced.

July 5, 2010: "We don’t want to lead with “anonymous (currency)”… (or) “currency outside the reach of any government.” I am definitely not making an such taunt or assertion." - Satoshi
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:46:51
This is why me and and many people have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the Bitcoin Foundation.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:59:10
In this day in age news is probably the most important piece of "real estate'. As much as I would like to believe in what you are saying, I can't because without some of the positive articles and the surge of the articles last year we wouldn't be where we are today.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:56:37
First thing that came to my head, is this ad:  . Think Diffrent! Satoshi is one of the crazy ones. What happened to that apple? Without Steve the company is different.

Here is the inspiration 
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:52:41
I didn't say that everything they are doing is terrible, I'm grateful for the fact that they support the dev but the whole idea of the "foundation" is completely flawed. The whole purpose of bitcoin is to create a decentralized system away from government corruption but thanks to the bitcoin "foundation" we have our own 'government' that's corrupt. I have seen more work being done from individuals that spread the word by creating graphics, sites, adverts etc than I have ever seen come out of the Bitcoin "foundation" ever has. We, the community, are the people behind bitcoin and are responsible for spreading the word. We don't need a "foundation" to tell us what to do.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:06:57
They aren't able to vote right now because they don't know how but we are talking about the future here. This the same future where most of  us believe that mass adoption will happen and 1BTC will equal 1BTC.  
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:50:34
Remember to mention that to . Thanks
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:21:47
We should get them to accept Bitcoin on their site. I was about to purchase a tshirt or two but I really want to BUY it using Bitcoin. I'm sure that they would also get a few more donations if they started accepting BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:43:09
Yes but in order to gain influence you have to get the people on your side and with publicity such as "Bitcoin Hacked" you can't gain mass adoption at a fast rate. There is a reason why politicians spend millions on tv campaigns, to get the masses on their side.
@_date: 2014-05-24 10:08:31
I had the exact same problem and I've been using LocalBitcoins for a while now.

I can see that people on this sub are a bit too positive  just by looking at other post with necessary criticism getting down-voted alot and I'm pretty certain that this will be downvoted to hell which really makes me question the community on this sub.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:07:11

Similarly to a reply to another question, Oil has power players which are way more powerful than any Bitcoin power players and that's the reason why it's so successful. What we need is the public opinion to be on our side.

Here is mine:
First of I would like to say that I'm sixteen years old and like many I have been inspired by your company. I have taken the time to tell you my personal opinion on apples recent actions.
Here is the problem, something at Apple has changed. After Steve Jobs passed away , the ethics and views of the company seemed to change. Don't get me wrong Tim Cook is a great CEO but the recent action Apple has taken worries me a lot.
In the History of Apple, there have been times of prosperity and trouble. Make this a period or prosperity, accept Bitcoin. Embrace the technology. Accepting Bitcoin could be the greatest PR stunt in the History of the company.
Remember, Think Differently. What happened to the Iconic Think Different AD? Remember "Those who are crazy enough to think they will change the world are the ones who do" Satoshi (Creator of Bitcoin) is the crazy one. The community behind Bitcoin is strong and will support those who embrace the technology.
Bitcoin has changed my life and inspired me to do many great things. My parents aren't millionaires they are your average middle class people. They always told me that I have to be independent and Bitcoin helped me with that. It taught me the basics of economics and it inspired me to do the subject at A Level. The point that I'm trying to make here is that just like Apple, Bitcoin changes lives.
Take one look at the community and you will realize that everyone is disappointed with your reaction to Bitcoin. The general consensus is that Apple needs to change.
Thanks for your time,
P.S: Remember Think Different 
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:03:56
Thanks for the warm words, I also sent an email to Tim Cook telling him to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:26:18
Well, it seems like the business is pretty solid
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:04:47
It's pretty amazing how we can put a face to Bitcoins recent developments. Satoshi (the crazy one) created it and we the community with the help of Gavin are taking it further.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:06:58

I think that bitcoin as a payment gateway could help because you never have to provide access to your funds. This what a credit card number does it gives people access to your funds, whereas as bitcoin address just gives you and id that's its you who's paying for the it.. 
Think about this: How many people have the same password on paypal? What happens when paypal gets hacked since they are part of Ebay Group?
