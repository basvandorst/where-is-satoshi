bitcoin the currency/token, not the protocol. 


Disregarding black swan events, gold is not heavily affected by news but more so by general economics. Also, it is not a hedge against inflation as many here seem to think but more of a leveraged long bond that is correlated to interest rates.


There are many.. such as the ever increasingly centralized mining process, the cornered-like market by early adopters, this was foreseeable and what makes bitcoin such an inherent bubble machine. With a different mining system, more equitable distribution, and less hoarding incentives it would actually be a viable global currency, but unfortunately it can't be one in its current form.

Technically speaking merchants are not allowed to price things in bitcoin in China. The Chinese mainly use it for speculation and to send money to each other peer to peer.

I'm all for it. People underestimate the psychological effect of 1 bitcoin = multiple hundreds or thousands of dollars. Make the base unit appear ''cheaper'' and transaction volume will increase.

Huobi and OKCoin are not included in those volume stats (only BTCChina is). If they were, the CNY volume would actually be the majority.
Also, most of the big price swings happen during Chinese trading hours and not Western ones. Even on normal days without Chinese FUD, the volatility significantly goes down when the Chinese sleep. An indication that most bitcoin trading still goes on in China.
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:17:11
Hoarding.. before when bitcoin's were not high priced (sub 100) people used to trade way more often and it acted more like a currency. IMO, the current hoarding defeats the whole purpose of a currency, it's mostly used as a speculative asset and whenever major bad news appears on mainstream media (such as the Silkroad bust or the China ban) you will see many hoarded bitcoins flooding the market. It's not a healthy economic system.

Gold is not designed as a medium of exchange, unlike bitcoin. Gold is primarily used as a store of wealth and behaves more like a leveraged long bond in term of USD. Also, gold is not heavily affected by news but more so by general economics. Bitcoin on the other hand has great utility as a medium of exchange, but certain economic parameters in its design effectively destroy this purpose.  
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:33:18


This is a bit misleading.. in no way has over 5 billion been lost. Only a small fraction of that has been recently exchanged. Market cap gives us a rough idea of how much bitcoin is worth overall, but says nothing about the money flowing in and out of the ecosystem. A lot of it is also on the sidelines waiting to jump back in when things settle down. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:44:16
Often price movements are almost purely technical and not really based on news. There doesn't always need to be a story to explain price movements.

Yep, the only downside to is that it isn't available to Americans due to certain forex legislation, but is available to most of the world. Also, there are some pip-spreads. Nevertheless, it is a safer alternative to BTC-e if you want to store fiat there and are waiting for dips (their fiat accounting systems are different).

I like most things about bitcoin, but the public ledger is what I hate the most. It makes no sense given its anarcho-libertarian origins. Bitcoin is actually less anonymous than regular banking. If this doesn't get fix soon, another altcoin (like Zerocoin) with way more privacy might overtake it.

Many bitcoiners actually do not deplete their main bitcoin holdings through online purchases, but send fiat to an exchange before buying something with it a few minutes/hours later.

Bankers would have a field day crashing bitcoin if it weren't for day traders providing liquidity and to some extent stability (as speculators can be both bears or bulls). The function of day traders is severely underestimated by many bitcoiners.

As if there isn't any insider trading going on in bitcoin now. The recent Gox drama was full of obvious insider trading showing up on the charts on other exchanges.

Since everyone was thinking it wouldn't take off again months ago, but now everyone thinks it will go off, I think the opposite will happen again. Bitcoin seems to be work in the favor of contrarians.

Perhaps the 31st Jan date will be more of a bull trap than a bear one. All the bulls are expecting a massive bull run in February after the China nonsense is sorted out. But they forget that bitcoin tends to go sideways/downtrend for months on end before the next rally. The following months will test the patience of the bullish holders. I expect them to lose hope after awhile and eventually start selling en masse between March-May. 700-800 coins will look very pricey by then. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 11:28:33
