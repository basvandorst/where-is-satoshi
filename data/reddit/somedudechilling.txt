Unannounced? I remember very clearly Coinbase sending out an email to all customers informing them of future bch integration. Months of notice was given.
Coinbase is where people convert usd to crypt. Blaming Coinbase for insider activity is like blaming tdameritrade for a pre earnings run up of a stock. It happens everytime! No secret like this can be kept perfectly locked down. If people knew they would obviously go to Coinbase for the trade. This is not the fault of Coinbase, it is just the reality of this market.

Because integration requires no coding, testing, or work? It should just be instant, just because.

Exactly right. I am trying to imagine who exactly is bent out of shape about this event. If you held bch before, now you are happy because you have a 60% gain. If you didn't hold, then who cares, you didn't believe in it so why would you want it now. So it seems to me the only people that are crying foul were people panic buying during the rip who took losses because they were panic buying. That is not Coinbase's fault.
Coinbase gave months of notice. The Ceo recently made clear announcements they would be adding coins. Anyone with any sense would guess bch would be the first considering all the pressure they were under to release locked up bch to their customers.

Technically speaking this is a near perfect double top from the 2013 high. Usually a heavily traded asset will react to previous highs like this before breaking through to new highs. The experienced trader would have waited for this move and began scaling in today for what is most likely to be a fresh move to new highs.

Absolutely right. Price is a measure of adoption, and with speculative investing being the only meaningful form of adoption price will only go so high. It would be great if bitcoin was gaining ground in commerce instead of losing ground. It blows my mind that it seems less merchants accept bitcoin now than this time in 2017. One would think after a year like 2017 it would be used almost everywhere. What happened?
