IF you a hacker did make such a deal we might start to see a rally around bitcoin. .... But i don't expect this will happen.

Blockchain is a powerful idea with crazy potential to be used in such diverse ways. This is a business model and nothing really revolutionary, better than the current youtube monopoly and that is why there is appeal. 
I was thinking something similar to this idea but instead another altcoin that has a decentralized network that uses "cloud" storage for people to "mine".  Then anyone can upload content to this network and it could be mucho public/decentralized.

Hey Mark,
I have one question and a follow up. 
How come no information about how you asked customers for additional funds to expedite payments when the shit was hitting the fan? Was there a game plan? Did you anticipate collecting enough funds to solve the financial issues of Mt.gox or were you just filling your pockets because the writing was on the wall. 
No judgement passed, just genuinely curious. 
Because of on going litigation I don't imagine you will able to respond directly.
