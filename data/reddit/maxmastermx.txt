I'm really new to bitcoin, but I still like to believe that I have done a fair amount of research about the technology and other cryptos. This hard fork on december 28th really confuses me anyway. 
From what I've understood this fork and the new coin called b2x will address the issues of long and expensive transactions by increasing the block size. I've read that they will work and support eachother somehow, ease the work load. BUT is this not exactly the same as another Bitcoin cash?? There will be no improvements to the actual original bitcoin?
My question is: Is it possible to increase the block size of the original coin, or improve it in some other way instead of creating a fork with a new coin?
 Otherwise it feels like that coin is doomed to slowly die..
