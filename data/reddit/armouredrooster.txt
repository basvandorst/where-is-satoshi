Effort you've made: zero.
Effort I will make in return: zero.

Bought $500 today, and have watched it go from $8k AUD to $9.3k AUD in the space of 24hrs.
What have I gotten myself into?

It's got nothing to do with regulation - the market maker (ie the counter party) determines how much risk they're willing to take by offering leverage to their customers, and given how volatile BTC is I doubt any market maker will accept that much leverage.

There is no way that market makers are going to accept 24:1 leverage on BTC. You'd have to hold a lot of collateral with them to accept that risk.

Exchanges don't 'hold the bag'.

I set myself up on both Coinbase and Independent Reserve, and tried both (bought half on one and half on the other). Both are better/worse for different reasons, so I'd suggest doing a bit of research on those two. You can also check out r/BitcoinAUS.

People are realising recent gains.

I don't want to be mean, but if that is the kind of question you're asking you've got a lot more research to do.

The market maker will likely need to take positions in the underlying (i.e. Bitcoin) to hedge against large positions taken by traders. 
For example, if a Bitcoin futures trader buys 100 BTC futures, and this is the only contract in the market, then the market maker will likely choose to buy BTC on market to protect itself from significant upward movements in the BTC price. This will be further exacerbated should traders act en masse in one direction (which, given the highly bullish nature of most people here, would likely happen).

You seem to be assuming they intend to paint Bitcoin in a good light.

You don't pay GST when you exchange currencies with Bitcoin.

Keeping $1k on the sidelines until a drop occurs. Check back in in a couple of weeks to see whether that was a good idea!

I was going to write up a couple of sentences explaining why this is the stupidest thing I've read this week. But I've decided not to, as that would just be a waste of my time and your time, wouldn't it?
