If you go to your online banking it shouldn't be hard to find - it'll probably be under account details or account requests.
You can also find it on most current account statements.

Transfer the BTC to bitstamp and do a SEPA transfer. It's slow (1-3 days) but I don't know of any quicker method.
You can check the fees and limits here:

It's really not that risky. Vacuum sealing packages limits how easily it can be sniffed. The drug dogs aren't even on duty for the whole day anyway.
Okay worst case scenario: The police intercept your package and show up to your door to ask questions about it (most of the time they send a "love letter" a letter asking you to come to the police station to discuss it but not requiring you to by law).
You deny knowing anything about the package. It's not hard to find someones full name and address, anyone could have sent that to you. I don't think there has ever been a case of someone being charged or arrested for receiving drugs in the mail. (Although people have been arrested for selling drugs after the authorities noticed they were receiving SR orders)
It would be cool if the geohasing system was the case but the reality is: Who needs ingenuity when you can just abuse incompetence?

"Contract Length: Indefinite"
They're not even trying lol

Why? What is Epanga wrong about?
He's encouraging someone to find a resolution for a disagreement between a guy and his parents? Do you honestly believe that asking for money from a family member* warrants complete abandonment?
Edit: Should't have just said "asking for money" because it's cleary more than that. *Asking for money, guilting him into giving him money, discouraging him from investing in bitcoin.

That's really cool. You've inspired me to order a Pi and do something like this.

The BTC award per block changed from 50 to 25 on Nov 28th 2012 so that might explain the drop around that time. The consistent variation, I think, relates to the increase in difficulty every X amount of blocks mined.

I think it'll be a security flaw. One of the exchanges will either get DDOS'd, hacked or something of that nature. There aren't that many exchanges as it is and Bitstamp and MtGox aren't handling the increase in users. With increasing popularity attempts to exploit security flaws will only increase and I doubt the extent of security used by exchanges and individuals will increase at the same rate as people wanting to steal some cash.
Edit: Is it too late to change my answer to lag panic ?

I think he's mocking the people that try to say that bitcoin is viable currency for day to day transactions.
It seems like you agree -


 
Also, 


I think most of the people who own a substantial amount of any currency would care about the volatility of it? No ?

I had this issue and also the issue where no matter what log-in details I used it would bring me to the same account.
Changing from Chrome to Firefox fixed it but it may have been a coincidence. Worth a try though!

Your parents are being shitty but i'm surprised about the the number of people saying "Don't give them a cent". 
Don't you feel you should at least do something nice for them like buy them a gift or take them out for a meal or something? 
Unless they never helped you with school, kicked you out of the house at 16 and didn't generally help you in life? It seems to me that you're avoiding showing gratitude to spite them for their shitty attitude.

Why are you so angry? He didn't call you stupid. He was talking about how people talk about the success of bitcoin being a result of the ideology behind it when it's more accurate that it's partly that and partly because many people used it to make easy money off of. You can argue about what has contributed more but you surely can't deny that it's a combination ?


That's pathetic of you to bring charity in to a discussion about bitcoin under the guise of proof that you believe in the currency.

Well Tor is pretty safe as far as anonymity goes but many users and probably all vendors use VPNs and other methods in conjunction with Tor. There is a review system and the forums are very active. There is also an escrow system.
An example order from start to finish:
You "tumble" your bitcoins to your SR account's address (Using a tumble service just increases the difficulty of your BTC being traced back to your original wallet).
You browse the forums and the site until you think you have a reputable vendor with reviews from reputable people. You find Bobby McDrugDealer selling 1 gram of coke for 1 BTC. He has 98% feedback and over 300 transactions.
You place an order with him using PGP Encryption to tell him your address. The order is accepted and the money is transferred to the escrow system.
Bobby sends the package to you. The package is designed to attract as little attention at customs as possible (Note: domestic packages experience much less scrutiny as they avoid customs) The envelope is double vacuum sealed with professional-looking labeling.
You receive your order a few days later and when you do, you log onto SR and mark the order completed. You leave your feedback and the BTC held by the escrow system only now gets transferred to the vendor. 
Sale complete

I'm not an expert in this but I do know that FLOPS aren't an indication of how fast a rig can mine bitcoins because the calculations used in mining are integer operations.
It would be cool to see an estimate from someone who really understands this but I suspect we won't have any idea until someone tests it.

"I would like to see a bitcoin exchange where the buyer of coins is forced to “take delivery” of those coins to a bitcoin wallet that is not held by the exchange.  I fully understand that any buyer could then turn around and manually deposit those coins back into this exchange... but I believe that the time it takes to take delivery and send them elsewhere would keep the traders out of this exchange."
That is a terrible idea. I don't see why anyone who is making a profit treating bitcoins as a commodity wouldn't just change to a different exchange.
The only thing we can do as a community is use bitcoin to purchase goods/services and encourage others to do the same.
