There is a massive amount of creative entrepreneurs and developers building all kinds of things in the Lightning Networks ecosystem. A lot of new investment has come into the space and it’s gaining momentum...all this despite the price being a bear market. 
Lets gooooo!

Except everybody couldn't get their paychecks in BTC. It's not designed to do that, for now fiat works better at it. But there's projects making stablecoins for this purpose.

We'll be air-dropping jizz to everyone to propogate the network

It would be. Most will be too slow to adopt and sacrifice their short-term profits so they'll end up obsoleting themselves. Too big to change.

Bitcoin can survive any media exactly because BTC is very robust. Everytime it hits the news more people learn about it. Most currencies, companies, and countries suffer if they get a bad reputation. But BTC is immune. This is why most people think in cycles, but BTC can only die if the technology breaks \*impossible\*

Bitcoin is like Jesus, just give it 3 days

Clearly haters are gonna hate. A young student putting something into freakin space, that also happens to be related to Bitcoin. It's an awesome sign for the future of crypto

While BTC won't be common to use in the next 10 years it's price will still rise to match it's value as a matter of being very good at what it does. People forget that all the other blockchain projects that are designed with a simple UI and the huge progress made in there. Bitcoin will always be "The Coin" because it's simply has the best story for the masses.

Every single explanation he gives here is very clear if anyone needs to understand how Lightning Network works and why to/not to use it.
