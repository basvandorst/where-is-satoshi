What do you mean by "instant wealth transfer"? That the transactions don't take as long as normal transactions (PayPal, Visa, MasterCard etc.)?

Thanks for the response! Definitely worth looking into, just need to figure out what the montecarlo solution is... one question: what did you mean with tx fees? Transaction fees?

Thanks for the ideas! However I don't know if this could be applicable, because in section 2 I am asking if Bitcoin can function as money according to Mises's Regression theorem. Then in the third part could be an analysis against the Euro. Germany adopted Bitcoin as their legal tender, so maybe if the Euro would fail, Bitcoin could be a potential currency? I am completely lost when it comes to third section, I know I don't want to do any statistics or mathematical models.

Definitely not. But prices for electronics fall due to an increase in production efficiency
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:16:33
Thank you for your answer though? That was really helpful!

Thanks for the explanation. So Bitcoin reaches its 21 million and the growth of supply stops. Since the amount of Bitcoins is fixed, Bitcoin is scarce and therefore valuable. The economy still produces the same amount of goods and services, but since Bitcoin became more valuable, the price of goods and services in relation to Bitcoin is falling. If I could buy a pizza with 10.000 Bitcoins six years ago, when Bitcoin reaches its 21 million I might only need 0,000001 BTC to buy a pizza. The price of that pizza declined because Bitcoin became more valuable. But if I believe that Bitcoin on the future would be even more valuable, I start hoarding it, so that the amount of Bitcoins in circulation is low (or lower) and that is not good for the economy.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:19:51
Very true. People will hoard Bitcoin because it is scarce and therefore valuable and so will the amount of bitcoins on circulation decline and slow the economy
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:30:23
Maybe because Bitcoin will be more valuable in the future and the debtor would not like to give the money back? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:35:41
Well, it is unfortunately too late for that. I'm done writing the second section, but need to structure the third one. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:17:27
Why less attractive? When the growth of Bitcoin stops and the fixed amount is reached, then Bitcoin would become even more attractive, because it has high value, so owning Bitcoins will become attractive.

Why would it be difficult for him to pay back? Why wouldn't you give a loan in BTC?
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:14:00
Very good point of view and very true. The last thing didn't come on my mind. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:18:58
It feels more like being indirectly pressured into paying a fee if you want your transaction to be put in the block.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:15:28
So that would make five differences. Anything else I forgot? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:18:54
Just like you stated above, deflation is bad for governments and debtors. This can be explained with Fisher's equation r = i - π.
When inflation is negative, then the real interest rate is higher, meaning money is more valuable now and I do not want to lend it. This leads to hoarding. Would you mind explaining me more why deflation is "bad" for governments and debts?
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:14:32
But what else would give value to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:18:09
What do you mean by new systems?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:33:03
Would you mind explaining this to me? Thank you in advance
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:15:53
That is the same way I see it. I'm not an expert in macroeconomics (the last lecture was a while ago) and I just started studying Bitcoin. But anyway, I am not here to fight, but to gain some knowledge from helpful people
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:12:04
Thank you! Very smart comment, especially the last part of it. It helped me understand a lot! 
When there is deflation, people avoid going into debts, because due to deflation, money will be more valuable in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:39:46
This was a very helpful comment! Thank you so much! 
If people lose their coins, then the supply of Bitcoin also shrinks, leading to more deflation and placing more value on Bitcoin. I need to check that part with Krugman and the Keynesians!
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:57:05
No need to be rude. I didn't understand it, so I asked for help. Still, thanks for the answer
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:12:44
So, with Bitcoin that would be immediate, but with a bank account that would definitely take a few days. One must also consider that banks are closed on holidays and weekends. But with Bitcoin I can send BTCs anytime and anywhere?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:55:03
When something is scarce, people prefer hoarding that thing because they assume that it will be even more valuable in the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:13:24
Thanks for the comment! Really helpful! Can this be described with the help of the quantity theory of money? If the economy grows then Y grows (more output), M remains constant (no more growth of Bitcoin), but what happens to the velocity V and the price level P?
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:21:58
No, they do it voluntarily. But I feel like that "perk"  that transactions within the Bitcoin network are for free is misleading
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:36:36
I prefer inflation, because then that money would be less valuable (I could buy less goods with it, or in a case of a hyperinflation maybe ten pieces of bread), but if there is a deflation, then the money I own would become even more valuable, hence I prefer to pay back the debt as soon as possible because as time passes, my debt would gain even more value (and I lose more money).
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:05:38
Very true. Bitcoin started off with a very high inflation rate, but now it is around 4% and it will continue to sink. Whether it comes to a deflation depends if the economy will shrink, remain constant or if it will grow.
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:16:41
So, if I decide not to pay a fee, then the miner might decide not to "conduct" my transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:44:59
Do you have any ideas about this? A bit more thorough explanation would be very appreciated :-)
