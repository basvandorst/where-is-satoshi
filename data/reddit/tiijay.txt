A complete ban specially offline is the wrong Way i think :&gt;
The online ban is ok , cuz clickable scams , phishing , etc.

Warning for german Redditers pls check Energie Costs . Machines on ebay will make you pay 1-5$ a day for mining . 
The miners are selling cuz there are better miners or they wanna sell at high prices (gpu) and wait for the low prices of gpu when miners wont buy that many gpu cuz its not worthy anymore

@_date: 2018-03-29 06:37:00
Why „lmao“ in most of the countries i know , u have to make a complete ID- Check before youre able to buy/transfer amounts above 100$ a day . 
So if you stay in small amounts it shouldnt be a big problem , above you have to make a complete id check . 
Maybe some suspicious Sites offering more without checking anything ...

Nope not a true physical one . 
Mastercard announced these days that the will only cooperate with a centralized crypto so that will never happen .
In my opinion TenX will be the next true crypto creditcard . They already had one but it was banned by the cardcompany . New quards shoul show in the next days „end of Q1 2018“

To much hype,  less understanding . 
The new ones didnt even understood what they were buying just heard about a good way to make fast money.
And this people are actually leaving .
 Nothing more nothing less.
Im buying bitcoin almost weekly and try to use it when i can , also im spreading the possibilties in my circle of friends . 
We gonna accept bitcoin in our bar in northern Germany . Crypto is not really a thing here :&gt;
Even if u are about to start nowadays u can use bitcoin without loosing money :
Got fiat at coinbase and when i wanna buy something i exchange it into bitcoin and buy stuff then .
This way youre supporting bitcoin and dont loose money while downtrend is on 
(i got into crypto in february thats why i have to do it this way) 
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:22:45
Mhm or the left arm . Or fuck it ��
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:12:49
Nice downvotes , its not FUD . That is just an Information . For me this is try from whoever to illegelize Bitcoin .  
Like the last try (you can read in the news) putting virus signatures inside so that the blockchain gots deleted on people pcs via antiVir progs
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:48:16
Let the weak hands leave it will make bitcoin stronger . Fees are low and so bitcoin get useable for small everyday purchases . 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:16:10
Take my upvote , ur math is good 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:27:54
Never sell at loss , the rest is up to you . 
Im buying a bit every week :&gt;
