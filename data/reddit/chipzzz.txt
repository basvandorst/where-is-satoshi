If they'd brought their checkbooks, it would already be done.

So your solution is to stay home on election day rather than choose between the giant douche or the turd sandwich? Do you imagine that the powers that be will suddenly wake up one day and realize that we don't want Bush III vs Clinton II (Bill's evil twin), for example, and then everything will be alright?

Well, [they don't have far to go]( to hit your 20% benchmark, but I really don't think it's going to open any more eyes than 2014's 36.3% already has. Maybe if they hung a few of the war criminals (Bush (either one), Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al.), or jailed more than a token crooked shyster or two now and again, the government would gain some credibility in the eyes of the electorate. Of course that will never happen, so I assume that America will follow in the footsteps of all over-expanded empires sooner or later, and my guess would be sooner.
The lies are already so transparent that they're adjusting the public school curriculum to prevent six-year-olds from calling them out; They've got everyone under mass surveillance so that they can cut the thought-criminals out of the herd easily; They've got rigged voting machines (Diebold), the "electoral college" that is not representative of the popular vote, and gerrymandered congressional districts to make sure that even when people do figure it out, they can't do anything about it anyway; They've militarized the police and planted 800 military bases in 70 countries (I've read that they're in twice as many and will have to look into the discrepancy) to keep the lid on all this; and the list goes on and on...
Other superpowers are already stepping up to fill the void: Russia is starting to clean up the Bushes' catastrophes in the Middle East, China's economy is overshadowing America's, and the BRICKS Alliance will soon be able to assure the international community that Wall Street's greed will never devastate the entire world's economy again. Washington has already plundered about as much of the rest of the world as it can, and it is turning inward, cannibalizing its own "middle class" (i.e. "the 99%," as if 99% of the population could constitute a "middle class" in a capitalist system). There is no reason for that 99% to care about any of it, since there's nothing in it for them: Washington has been bought by the 1%, the game is rigged, and the best they can hope for is not to be starved to death while their lords and masters gorge themselves to death chanting "greed is good."
You think that when the voter turnout drops to 20%, it will magically open everyone's eyes, but I'm pretty sure that a lot of people's eyes are already open, and that's what's becoming the government's worst nightmare.

They are especially shitty douchey options, but that's what America is offered. Congress usually has a 15% approval rating, give or take a little, and despite all their phoney excuses, it's because it's a shitty douchey Congress. Ditto most of the rest of the "elected" government. They're all so busy lining their pockets with graft that they don't care what the people think and have no intention of changing, much less fixing, anything.
Don't vote if that suits you, but don't be surprised if America's politicians don't wake up one day and say," Hey, there's something wrong here... We'd better fix it," because from where they're sitting, there isn't and they don't want to.

I came here to say that. The government destroys everything it touches, so the less it has to do with crypto, the better I like it.
@_date: 2015-12-23 21:50:42
Garbage. "The fish rots from the head down," and if politicians weren't selling their worthless a**es (not to mention our interests) to the highest bidder every day, the government wouldn't be so badly broken. They've made the rules to protect their crooked schemes, we're stuck paying the bill, and it's nobody's fault for choosing the lesser of two evils in every election except the greater of those two evils.

The crypto markets were doing quite nicely until the CBOE decided it wanted to trade futures, and then right away the government wanted to regulate them... Look where they're at now... Sorry, but the sad truth is that the government destroys everything it touches...

Uh oh... Now you're picking a fight with the shoe lobbyists! Next to the Israeli lobby, they're the most powerful force in American politics.

I can't help wondering if government legitimization is a good thing. What's intrinsically good about Bitcoin is that it is impervious to governmental manipulation. Once the government steps in, the bankers will be close behind to rig the game just as they do with the worthless paper that governments now print, and Bitcoin will become just another "coin of the realm."
The only viable argument against this scenario is that there is a finite limit to the number of Bitcoins that can be mined, as opposed to the paper that governments print with reckless abandon. Yet, the same is often said of real estate ("they aren't making any more of it"), and yet the banks routinely speculate in that with the same fluidity that they do any other commodity.
The fact that New York State recently appropriated several tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins is equally troubling, since they now have a significant interest in the market, with all that implies.
All of this raises warning signals with me, and I wonder if anyone has any thoughts on the subject...

I like to think of "the business cycle" as "the grand pump-and-dump," with events like the 2008 global meltdown exemplifying my point admirably. Perhaps, as you suggest, it was a lack of prudence, but it seems inappropriately coincidental that the imprudent actors were the ones that profited most in the long term from the catastrophe that they caused.

It collapses regularly in what they call "the business cycle." Guess who profits when it does...

I thought that the government destroyed everything it touched, but now I realize that it just cripples some of them for a while.

The same is true of all the other investment vehicles that they now control. The problem is that sooner or later, everyone cashes out, and unless one is wealthy to begin with, the cash-out often comes sooner rather than later, and at an inopportune time. That's how all of the current financial markets have become so lucrative for the wealthy, and so costly for the not-so-wealthy: The wealthy can ride out the "dump" phase without suffering any inconvenience, and buy at the beginning of the "pump" phase. The not-so-wealthy are prone to balloon mortgages, bad job markets, and a variety of other circumstances that can cause them to liquidate at the wrong time.

There's nothing like a trip down memory lane to remind us what conservatives represent.

Wall Street has developed an interest in Bitcoin, and I can't help feeling that when it moves in, it will buy enough to enable itself to manipulate the market. Then the game that the bankers have been playing for generations will invade the cryptocurrency sphere: The "business cycle," a.k.a. "the grand pump-and-dump" will periodically empty everyone's investment into their pockets. They've done it with the stock market, the lending market, the housing market, the education market, and every other conceivable marketplace.
Can anyone allay my fears?
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:01:29
So, were the politicians just threatening their "reverse Midas touch" so that they could buy in cheaply, or do they have another less obvious agenda?

Then they haven't looked very closely at the CIA and FBI drug operations.


That was online poker's mistake. Nobody bribed the politicians, and now it's gone.

Clam AV is among the first things I install in a Linux machine and, from what I understand, it's highly regarded among security pros. As far as I know, it's in all the major repos and is easily installed from a tar.gz if no other option is available.

That's why they object. The leaders of the financial system periodically disrupt it for substantial profits, and don't want anyone interfering. Since they pay off the lawgivers to perpetuate their scheme, and the lawgivers' political lives are dependent upon this bribery, the likelihood of an external entity being permitted to threaten it is negligible.

An even more egregious abuse is the way they finance the educations of people who weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths, but want to earn a better life. To many of those graduates, the "financial system" becomes a leach who has stolen their dreams with the promise of a brighter future that it continues to make decreasingly likely as time goes on, while collecting interest on that debt the whole while.
