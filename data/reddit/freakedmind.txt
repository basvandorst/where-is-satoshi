You can buy anything from the Microsoft store with Bitcoin, wouldn't call it "no use"

Yes, the long term prediction is fairly accurate, I was looking for some short term tips, like say a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:32:56
YES! Now I can buy lots!
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:42:37
Well, it's just that I think the price is at a high and it's going to fall very soon. It's just my theory and I want to see if it holds true :)

Lol I thought it was gonna be some article about some dude who could have bought bitcoin when it was only worth hundreds, this was better though.

Of course! Damn, I guess I need to work on what posts this sub will like 
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:38:44
That's true, I'll start it off in a few days time, just want to see where the price is going.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:50:42
I do realize it's a question that doesn't have a right answer, I was just hoping for some tips from more experienced users :)
