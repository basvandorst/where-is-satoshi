Always get a little misty with this response. The "moon" may mean a Lambo for one person or securing a future for your child. Its beautiful

Yeah but how much did you pay for the BTC? If you paid less than $35 initially, than you got a discount on your purchase.

You didnt provide a source for your claim though
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:55:16
Also, you cant refute what I am saying?

I dont hold any Monero
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:28:40
This is simply not true. People will use privacy coins, mainly Monero, if they have any clue what they are doing

Authorities can easily trace your Bitcoin back to you, unless you take diligent steps to obfuscate your transaction history. Hell, they were able to trace back Ulbrichts transactions to his computer wallet. I highly doubt 90% of users of Bitcoin are doing this.
Monero definitely takes these responsibilities out of the users hands with ring technology.

Jesus THIS. Bitcoin is the foundation off all of this. This is clearly evident by these attacks by people trying to make a quick buck off of forks. Not only is it not making any lasting damage, it STRENGTHENS the faith we have in Bitcoin.

You clearly dont understand what crypto is about.

Im just gonna put it out there that you should invest as young as possible. Whether it be with Bitcoin or what. You are at a super young age where you can take high risk and not impact a nest egg. Compound interest is exponentially higher if you can get into investing right out the gate.
Good for you for already thinking about your financial future and welcome to Bitcoin. Its bumpy, but rewarding

This is nothing. Just hang tight and buy the dip.

That just proves that the people driving these forks dont care about the community, only capitalizing off of it. If they expend their resources into developing the core community, we would all win
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:50:20
Just read over in the other community that someone traded 90% of their BTC for BCH and bought in at $1800. It is sitting at $1100 now. Ouch

Kind of sad, actually. They didnt specify the dollar amount of the investment, but they could have lost a TON of money on that gamble
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:40:44
Why invest long term into something you really dont care about when you can manipulate the market and make a quick profit and run?
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:29:06
Yes. If you look at the pending transaction, it tells you how many bitcoins was in the purchased. You locked in that price

The whole point behind investing in something is to calculate the cheapest moment you can get into the investment because you are convinced it will go up in value. Investments arent a simple math problem
