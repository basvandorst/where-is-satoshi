Bitcoin will be replaced by something else by the. 2030, maybe!
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:09:30
Skeptic friends be like: $3K it's too late to get in.
Bitcoin reaches $18K: you need to sale.
Never listen to your broke ass friends.

Not to give an internal error!

Don't store private keys on a computer.
Use a paper wallet for long term, or buy a hardware wallet for a secure way to hold and use your coins

How is this different from people posting their full credit card info?
This has nothing to do with new comers and everything to do with stupidity.

Every growing market is always in "a bubble".
Everything that goes up must come down. BUT! A good market always finds it's way back up.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:00:42
Oh, my bad, misread:)
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:44:57
Actually if there are a ton of people waiting for the dip meaning they're not buying, so the price should start to fall
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:27:25
I wonder how many people might lose their assets when attempting this.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:52:25
Fuck the FCC!
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:46:56
I wish I had the skills :(
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:26:21
Of course it's all there. You now have $100mil, but don't be hasty and sell!
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:44:32
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:10:40
Can you elaborate, why it's identical?
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:40:28
It will give you a sense of pride and accomplishment :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:45:26
Not exactly hard to achieve. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:41:49
Everyone just relax!!! 
Ethereum is still around $300
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:37:41
But until then it will probably dip.
I hope 3K, but that's no longer a realistic dip :/
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:55:02
Not sure anout 2x replay protection "workaround"
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:20:55
But we're talking about a world were there is only btc, if I understand the meme correctly. So how many chickens for a satoshi
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:58:37
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:13:15
Segwit (1) did reduce fees, the problem is the adaptation. If I understand correctly, most nodes don't (yet?) support it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:43:51
Birocrats are not the smartest of people
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:20:09
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:53:29
But! If BTC drops all altcoin will fall as well.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:05:37
Thanks for making it clear
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:51:30
Ta ta tam ta tam
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:59:14
Maybe I misunderstood what you meant by "waiting for the dip"
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:06:02
RemindMe! 2 days
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:14:23
But why keep using the same wallets? 
And why not erase the trace by converting to monero?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:15:40
Define everyone? Family and friends?
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:35:04
Where did you get it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:42:23
But will it dip before that?
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:29:42
How come?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:48:42
Trezor and Ledger are to support it, not sure if the exact date of the split 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:35:45
Can you elaborate on the risk to core hodlers?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:41:52
Dip already
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:11:14
That's true, it will dip in one way or another.
How low, maybe it will dip back to 9 when it hits 10.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:39:53
Or even shitcoin like electroneum
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:34:50
Search your email around that period.

2018: what was net neutrality?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:41:11
Yep :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:11:43
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:21:49
This should be pinned!
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:32:44
And gold, don't about the gold garbage
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:42:18
I hope btc drops another 2K
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:37:37
Love it! But the video sucks
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:19:49
Why it complements?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:54
You can also go with paper wallet as cold storage. Either way you'll have to store paper in one way or another.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:59:49
Last major dip to 3k, it jumped back to 4k in less than an hour if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:19:36
No idea. I'm hodling until after 2x, then see how this can be done.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:45:34
Decentralized network, tor it up or something.
But you should leave usa and come to Australia.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:44:03
It's because cash fan boys are spreading crap again.
They need a good 2x fork up their ass to to kill bch for good!

You mean by moving around $1m a million times? :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:06:47
To the floor!! :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:48:52
You still need to transmit your tx.
And assuming they will block all vpn and tor traffic, then...
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:49:50
If for cold storage, then paper
Own your wallet, otherwise they own it for you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:57:36
It's still better than this: 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:58:23
I hope 2x will cause 3k
I can dream, no?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:54:14
Interesting. And this came from which group?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:47:13
Good luck with those.

The only question I have, how simple will it be to split the coin to dump 2x without replay protection
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:16:07
When this happens what value will it actually have?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:34:00
It's all fud and emotions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:57:38
Hitbtc is shit "exchange"

It was I! I killed the dinosaurs. I ran them over with my truck 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:11:59
I hope it touches 10K for 5 min, then drops to 3K.
We'll get cheap BTC + some entertainment.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:25:06
2x doesn't have replay protection, right?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:41:43
Don't worry, there will be a dip soon and we'll buy more
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:51:32
Beta cash
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:30:45
Well he was right ;)
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:57:54
Of course but it our responsibility to push new comers to the right direction. I think it even says so in the side bar
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:18:26
Fake news again?
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:10:49
What about buying more?
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:32:36
What money
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:15:22
I'm listening
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:21:42
Bread is garbage, plus it's not an exchange!
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:18:21
And we buy
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:10:57
I now understand what's a replay protection, but what is a replay attack? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:54:30
Or Chinese government 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:52:47
The whole thing of republic of china is fake news

These fucker do run the country, so yeah.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:29:35
1. Because jp morgan tried to patent blockchain dozens of times and got denied.
2. Jp morgan are invested in ethereum (rumor)
3. Jp morgan lunching their own coin.
4. Bitcoin is not regulated by SEC, so he can say anything he wants. He's dropping the price to buy cheap.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:25:20
China is the boy who cried worf worf.

@_date: 2017-10-05 01:20:13
How people think they store it
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:13:36
They power servers with potatoes or the people pedal to the death?
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:15:01
Still better than surrendering your id to exchanges and random local strangers
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:17:35
Chines gov is surely creating panic and buys buys buys! 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:53:36
And for people outside the usa?

@_date: 2017-10-27 19:31:03
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:05:11
It's not clear, that's why it's being asked over and over.
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:16:00
Why not
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:51:51
Yes. Don't store it on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:54:53
Then his daughter 
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:08:32
I haven't tried it because it feels wrong. But if I select without id, they ask for 30% more because it's "risky".
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:17:53
It's not the same thing. People want security over their funds.
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:01:31
And his daughter 
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:05:11
It's the concept, not a specific implementation 
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:53:54
China is out, the hell with them
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:59:02
I only read the negative stuff, then buy
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:41:50
Honestly, I hope some Bitcoin whales loses a lot of money and sues 2x. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:44:51
What do you?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:08:38
This clickbait title is on the same level as: See how this simple African American who was born in Hawaii became the president of the United States with this simple trick.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:00:01
Pricy ;)
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:45:17
Even ethereum and monero?
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:42:58
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:23:10
I agree.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:12:09
The day later it will "crash" to $99K and they will say "I told you it's a scam"
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:15:44
Just like they make western companies "work for them", kick it out and push in chinacoin
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:45:44
If the price drops we'll buy more, and in all the confusion we'll accidentally buy the miners crap
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:14:42
They probably already do
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:26:26

Oh... fuck them then!
Thanks for making it clear.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:57:21
I just think sending money is risky, without a guaranty.
Maybe a wire transfer from your parent's bank account (with permission)?
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:02:34
Of course, but don't accumulate your fortune there
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:49:17
Appreciation for what, shit posts?
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:52:15
This should be pinned

@_date: 2017-09-10 07:31:44
Also, why would they tell the truth?! Even if there is a ban, they will milk all they can.
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:15:47
Medium well fucked

@_date: 2017-09-20 14:26:09

@_date: 2017-10-26 21:50:56
Nice one
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:24:32
Bad name, sounds like con me
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:47:33
And 2x will definitely have replay protection?

Yes but Breadwallet is no longer a good choice.
Their recovery phrase is behind the industry, so you won't be able to load your funds in other wallets. Also they force to use their units "bit", instead of BTC, mBTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:12:37
They don't have internet connection, except if you're a fat asshole with a retarded haircut

Will the stock market ever be a safe investment or always a gamble?

Will the retarded article market ever be a safe investment or always a gamble?

Because you don't really own your wallet, they do.
If they get hacked, it's gone. It the gov closes the exchange, it's gone. 
What happened to BTC-e was a good example of that. Maybe people will get their money back... who knows.
If you plan on long term investment, then you have 2 options: hardware wallet or paper wallet.
Do not use desktop/phone wallets to store large amounts and never for long term, you might get hacked.
Education is in very important in crypto. You should read more on this in sub's sidebar.

Exposing what everyone already knows? After 2008 this assholes should be in jail! 
But I guess $13B is enough to buy an out-of-jail card. It's like a regular person gets away with murder for just $13K.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:19:57
Keep it. It's actually an important question
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:48:07

Ahhh the big dip
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:58:42
Bit... you're banned
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:42:23
So you don't expend simply panic sale as it was when Cash was introduced?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:54:59
It's a the tone. The article starts by saying gold is bad, this is how you write a bias article. Personally, I'm against all forks that are not core.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:11:46
BTC, Cash, 2x, Gold, Shit-fork, crap-fork... no one fucking cares! Let us use BTC in peace or else it's time to sue the shit out of all exchanges who will dare to implement any of the shit forks without replay protection! 
P.S: this is obviously a bias pro 2x article
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:00:07
It's to protect their culture from western freedom

So it's not practical for JPM to buy BTC for itself?
Maybe I don't really understand what leverage ratio is, can you please ELI5?

You could just used a paper wallet.

If we have btc in core wallet, after the fork we'll get the same amount on 2x wallet (same address)?
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:26:04
Is there an article with full description of the process?
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:58:06
They continue to mine BTC and push their way with 2x, in the end they'll always earn big.

Not specific accounts, if CB itself is breached, the attacker has full to match the wallets

Step 2: raise your right hand.

And then we'll dance naked around the fire

It will be cheaper to order nano directly.
But if you insist on Amazon, then Ledger is an official seller there for like $75
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:20:44
Even if I use hardware or paper wallet?

That's so awesome. Where did you order it from?
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:54:10
When 2x and Gold forks hit it will drop below 3K, especially if they won't have replay protection which will cause a lot of panic.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:41:54
95/year is already too much for average joe,  are they deliberately trying to prevent users from storing the blockchain?!?

Never invest what you can't afford to lose 
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:38:20
The gold fork went quietly, but I hope 2x will cause enough panic to create a significant dip.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:40:16
What about wallets/exchanges that only support sms
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:55:14
That's what I'm talking about as well

Don't, find an atm

Of course not, but I have big hopes 2x will create a dip, I buy, then it sky rocks again

Now we're talking

If you're talking about send a small fund to a special address, then it's "replay protection" that 2x will have.

What's so good about them?

Then she went in, put a hat on and that's it
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:03:22
Yes.But when BTC goes up, it doesn't mean the alts go up as well.
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:28:42
Please it drop to 2K so I could buy a lot
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:24:24
But is it true?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:29:32
Does it trade fiat &lt;-&gt; btc? Or btc &lt;-&gt; alts as well?
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:10:33
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:04:23
I don't buy it

It supports cards?
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:54:51
Cool idea! 
Notes: move to a domain you actually own, not tk which you might lose. Also, https cert.
These two will improve the trust in the service
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:09:21
And then 2x
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:47:01
Segwit? Because it was core. The 2x and gold scam are more like Cash fork. I expect shit to hit the fan.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:36:10
It's called a scam

I honestly hope it takes a dive to $1K. So we could buy :)

Which basically means: it doesn't really matter
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:51:09
No one cares about gold. I expect a huge dip during 2x fork
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:58:33
No replay protection means NO free money!

Paper wallet sounds like a wise choice if you can't wait
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:47:28
And then to 3K when 2x hits.

It's better to move BTC to a new wallet before you do so.
