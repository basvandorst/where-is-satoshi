Short answer: **No.** 
Medium answer: The original blog was wrong. The only time bitcoin left the "Silk road seized bitcoin" wallet was when it was sent to the US Marshal's auction wallet. 
[Blockchain.info showing outgoing transactions from the silk road wallet.]( 
Blockchain.info is down right now so [check blockr.io]( if the problem persists. 
bitcoin.com needs to take the 30 seconds to verify what they read on a blog post before publishing it.
There was some random wallet that sent bitcoin to both the silk road wallet and the shadow brokers wallet. That proves absolutely nothing.

It sucks you had negative experiences on purse. I've used [purse extensively]( (screenshot slightly doctored for privacy) and had 1 negative experience but the moderators took care of it immediately. 
For me, the 15-20% discount cancels out the bad parts. Most buyers are not carders, but rather people who get paid in Amazon credit by mturk.com and want to cash out. They also get another ~5-8% of what they spend back by referring themselves using Amazon's associates program, so really they're just selling their Amazon credit at a ~10% discount.
First the good stuff:
 * I always get 15-20% off my stuff. (boring stuff that I'd get off Amazon anyways: Bulk coffee, cheap tools, toothbrushes, etc. )
 * I don't like to hold bitcoin in hot wallets but with coinbase integration, I buy the bitcoin and its immediately sent to purse.io [off chain transaction], so it's like 2 clicks and I'm essentially just paying with my bank account. 
 * Moderators are fair and respond quickly. 
 
Bad parts:
*  If you urgently need something, don't use purse.io because it may take a day or two longer to arrive. 
* Can't specify 3rd party vendors if they sell something cheaper than Amazon
* Fear of scams. Out of over 20 transactions, only 1 person has tried to scam me -- he sent me a tracking number that went to a package in a different state. Purse.io took care of it immediately but the ~4 day delay was annoying. (And I think a second may be trying to scam me right now, but we'll see in 2 days) To avoid scamming. Make your important orders above $65 so first time users can't buy for you and always verify the content of your package before confirming receipt. 
* Privacy -- anyone can see what you're buying while it's posted on the "Earn bitcoin" list so use a username that you don't use elsewhere.

This is so cool. In game items are totally ripe for blockchain applications. 
As a consumer, here's where blockchain items could help me: 
2016: I'm playing my favorite MMORPG and after hundreds (or thousands) of hours of playing, I've accrued some really sweet items. 
2017: The developer of my favorite MMORPG stops supporting the game with new updates, servers start to suck, they start banning players for unfair reasons, etc. The game is no longer fun and my items are now worthless.
With blockchain items another developer could attract [poach] gamers from the dying MMORPG. "Your sweet blockchain weapons and armor will still be sweet in our new MMORPG!" 
Some of these items might be used in multiple games. My previously intangible in-game items suddenly become a little more tangible. Maybe one day my grandchildren will be able to inherit my "antique" blockchain items and use them in their future virtual reality games. 
On the other hand, this whole thing could never get off the ground, or could totally implode.

Kraken sent out an e-mail to a lot of users about a month ago that said someone "likely in the Bitcoin ecosystem" had their password list compromised. (me included, thankfully I use 2FA and change passwords)
It could be BTC-E. I just checked, my BTC-E username was the same as my Kraken username. But that password list is *not* public. 
I've checked my username/e-mail on leakedsource and haveibeenpwned and I don't appear in any of their leaks so I suspect there is another password list that we don't know about.

OP of screenshotted thread here. Can confirm it's not [non-circumstantial] evidence. 
A few people PMed me after I started the thread and none of them mentioned using bitfinex. 
I wish kraken had sent us a hash of the password that the attacker tried to use... Then it would've been trivial to figure out who had leaked the password.
Also, I'm a security researcher. **Use 2FA and check haveibeenpwned.com for everything or else someone will hack you, steal all your bitcoin, and forward your embarrassing e-mails to wikileaks.**

I don't know any kraken reddit usernames but someone page them and ask them to send users the hash of the password that the attacker tried to use and then we can just confirm that it was leaked by bitfinex. 
Even if it's SHA1, it's very unlikely that anybody cracked the password I was using at bitfinex so it would've had to be saved in plaintext.

This is the problem right here. I *can* fake paying downloaders. I don't know how much of a cut bitcache is going to take. Let's say 50%. 
So: 
1. Upload a mediocre quality file but before anyone else uploads a high quality file.
2. Download it a few times, pay/give fake reviews, "5 Stars!!!!", "Better than all the other files on this site!"
3. Because I'm earlier than everyone else, and because I have some good reviews, people start downloading mine and it gets to the top of the list. 
Sure I invested a few bits at the beginning to get to the top of the list, but I get 100x that back by being the early mover. 
It's the same on reddit. The highest quality comments don't rise to the top. The first few decent quality comments get all the attention. 
I'm not saying bitcache is a terrible idea -- Kim Dotcom is a genius. But as I've seen it so far, it's far from perfect.

It could be that the dorian post was authentic. In the inbox screenshot you can actually see where the hacker reset his p2p foundation password.
Purely speculation but I imagine that the hacker got access to satoshi's e-mail (somebody posted that you could reset the password if you knew his birthdate, and could guess a new birthdate every 8 hrs, so it's not implausible that he spent a year or two trying to get in this way.

It's hard to evaluate bitcoin's value.
 Goldmine Sacks did a pretty good job at calculating how much bitcoin could potentially save consumers/businesses in [their report \(page 18\).](


savings if all electronic payments were conducted in Bitcoin could
potentially add up to over $150 bn in retail point of sale and $12 bn
in e-commerce fees per annum based on global 2013 purchase
volume. Using this math, merchants generating $1 million in annual
purchase volume would save at least half in payment processing
fees by accepting bitcoin, with small merchants even better off.
How much value does that give bitcoin? I have no idea. But *I'm* betting more than its current $6.6B market cap.

It depends on what metrics you use to designate flairs. Say I was a whiz blockchain programming whiz, I could just consistently give good information. After a couple of months I would earn a flair. 
Now I repeat it with 2 more accounts. 
Then I start 'AwesomeBitcoinArbitrageFund.com' and start taking 'investments' that pay off at 1%/day. 
Then you go and warn new users that if its too good to be true it probably is.
Then all 3 of my accounts start discrediting you and it's 3 against 1 and some newbie loses their money.

 Right now bitpesa accepts bitcoin and then sends money [to a system called M-Pesa]( I imagine that if Bitpesa and bitcoin prove successful, Kenyans (and other countries that use M-pesa) will eventually start cutting out M-Pesa (and Bitpesa) and simply using bitcoin for their transactions.
That would be awesome but it would mean the end of bitpesa acting as a middleman (I'm sure they'll find some other niche.)

There's no "business model". No direct way to monetize this (for anyone except mechanics). 
If I plan to sell my car used 10 years from now then I will maintain it properly and will choose a mechanic who is willing to use this decentralized records system. (He benefits because I choose him over mechanics that don't use it.)

TL/DR: I don't think you'll get a used item, but you definitely can get it from a 3rd party vendor. 
Interesting that you brought this up


I actually have had a few negative experiences with purse.io since I posted that comment. 
Specifically, I ordered a bike part that Amazon prime listed for ~$30 or a third party for like $28 with the catch that it was being shipped from Taiwan. 
When I ordered the part, it was in stock from Amazon prime. A few hours later when the bitcoin earner ordered the part, they bought it from the cheaper seller (via Taiwan).
(I'm not sure if Amazon prime had run out of stock when the order was made, but a few days later when I checked, Amazon had indeed run out of stock.)
This meant I had to wait like 3 weeks for the part to come. 
Purse.io support basically told me, "not our problem." 
 Also, I suspect the part was actually counterfeit because it didn't look like the authentic part it was replacing (which should've been identical). It just wasn't worth my time to argue with purse.io support over a $30 bike part that I was trying to save like $4-5 on.

I understand that but the law, as written is:
1) deceitful/misleading in name: 
'money laundering and terrorist financing' implies that digital currencies (or phone cards, lol) play a significant role in money laundering and terrorism. 
and 
2) ignorant as to how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work:
Firstly, the 'tumbler of digital currency' bit is ignorant of decentralized tumblers (ie: [CoinJoin]( anonymous by default currencies. (ie: [Monero]( ) and decentralized exchanges. Depending on interpretation, it could come dangerously close to encroaching on my 1st Amendment right to run computer code. 
Second, the 'interdicting digital currencies at border crossings' part: I don't understand how CBP can enforce that, but every possible scenario/interpretation of that wording is terrifying to me, as someone who holds quite a bit of crypto and occasionally travels abroad. 
As a pro-active citizen who understands the crypto space, this bill is ambiguously worded and scares the shit out of me. And you can bet your ass I e-mailed both of my senators about it.

I agree with you that he'd be undercharging for his services but as he states, he sees these initial clients "a good investment and reference which I could use later". 
He's essentially acting as a referrer -- at this point it's really unlikely that a tourist is going to walk in intent on paying with cash and then see that they accept bitcoin and pay with that. It's more likely that people are going to see the listing he put on coinmap, etc. and go out of their way to spend btc at the shop. 
Him charging someone $300 or $1000 or whatever to setup bitcoin payments and them seeing 1 bitcoin sale/yr would be bad for the client, him, and bitcoin in general.

One business model that is fair for the time being is "x% of bitcoin revenue". This should be more attractive to your customers because it reduces their risk and incentivizes you to do a good job on the marketing side. 
After you have a few customers you'll have more data on how much of a boost bitcoin will give your customers and can change over to a flat or hourly rate.

The money was still accessible to the customers but a lot of people incurred fees. 
I haven't seen a breakdown of exactly *what* the fees were but I imagine it's something like if you have under $1k in your checking account you pay a $5/month fee or whatever and sometimes it took people a few months to notice. 
I think they also signed people up for credit cards with annual fees, stuff like that.

*TL/DR: US patent holders probably can go after Bitmain in China but it'd be an uphill battle.* 
IANAL either but here's a [USPTO report on patent enforcement in China.]( 
There's a lot in here and I could easily be missing something but I highlighted a few of the interesting parts:
**US patent holders won't get fair treatment from judges**


for bribes Specifically, commenters indicated that U.S. rights holders perceive that some Chinese
judges display local protectionism in favor of local defendants and, perhaps relatedly, there is a
lack of judicial independence from political interference.
**US patent holders won't get a lot of damages**


compensate patent holders for losses, let alone act as a deterrent to would-be infringers.
Commenters indicate that in practice, Chinese courts revert to a method of damage assessment
that has a ceiling of approximately $156,000 (1 million RMB). While various methods of
damage calculation are available to Chinese courts, commenters indicated that evidentiary hurdles (see aforementioned evidentiary problems) make it nearly impossible for U.S. rights
holders to gather sufficient evidence to establish damages under other methodologies that might
allow for higher damages awards. Commenters also noted that since Chinese law does not treat
the exportation of goods to be an act of infringement, rights holders are disallowed from
including exported goods in calculating lost profits or other forms of damage.
On the bright side, **they *can* go after bitmain in China.** (Although I don't know if it's worth it because of the aforementioned evidentiary standards.)


within China but only exporting those goods and not selling any within China’s market. 
Obviously they're selling miners in China so can be gone after there. I'd say the evidence is pretty fucking obvious but I also know zilch about Chinese patent laws. 
Going after US customers would be unfortunate because many probably didn't know this was going on.

This seems like the most likely way for it to have come to light. 
But these miners have been widely available for at least 6 months. Pretty unbelievable that it took this long for someone to figure it out. 
Looks like they'll have to find a sneakier way to implement their backdoor in the next batch of miners now that everyone is looking for this. (Honestly, this was more of a 'front door' than a backdoor.)

The e-mail list is almost as valuable as the unhashed passwords anyways.
So many people reuse passwords that all an attacker would have to do is run the e-mails through a database of other leaks (or type them into leakedsource.com) and he'd get some hits. The whole thing is also moot if users have 2FA enabled.

It's not bad for current players. 
 I think they're planning on doing "seasons" which is something that Diablo 2 had [and probably loads of other games that I'm not aware of]. It's sort of a way to level the playing field for everyone so players who start a year after the game came out arent at a total disadvantage to players who have been playing since Day 1. 
At the end of a "season", they will reset people's progress. 
In Spells of Genesis, you level your cards up and if you get them to the very highest level then you'll be able to "blockchainize" them, which means it gets turned into a token on the blockchain and that way you can keep it between seasons/resets. 
This is a very simplified explanation of how it works, but I think it'll be a good way to reward players who put a lot of time into the game without punishing new players.

The ones in the image/pdf are the only ones I could "prove" were stolen and sent to bitcoin unlimited. (assuming the ones in the orange 12wPay address are indeed stolen, which needs to be confirmed by kraken). Those 11.5 and 13.9 go almost directly into bitcoin unlimited's  account from the 12wPay address. 
I am going to backtrack on the line "all appeared to come from that Kraken hack" because I can't confirm that 100%. I'm just saying that the rest of the btc they got that day followed a very similar mixing pattern.

[Current bitcoin hash rate]( is **1,689,127,847 GH/s**
((1,689,127,847 GH/s)/(14,000 GH/s )) * 1375 watts = 
**166,657,182 watts (166 MW)** if you assume that miners are using Antminer S9s or something with comparable efficiency.

The nice thing about adwords is how easy it is for Kraken to do this.

That's a lot of links. I don't have time to refute everything in all of them but I'm pretty familiar with the foreign policy article. 
First off, it's all based on an anonymous source. So you're *trusting* that this source is more reliable than WikiLeaks, which has never released a fake document. 
**Unnamed source's allegation:**


**WikiLeaks' response:** 


Ok... So did this anonymous source ever prove WikiLeaks' assertion that all of the documents weren't public?
Fortunately, the Foreign Policy article says: 


Where was it published? If we knew that, we could evaluate the allegation ourselves, right? But alas, FP expects us to just take their word for it.
from your comment:


Largely publicly available is the key word there. I don't know what percentage was publicly availble but I do know that not all of it was publicly available... It was in fact a legitimate leak against RU. Some number of the Podesta leaks was publicly available as well because of the FOIAs of Clinton's e-mails. 


I'd argue that mainstream media's coverage of WL is what changed the most. 
The second article is interesting. It acknowledges that WL has plausible deniability. ie: There's no proof. So you're basically taking John McCain and Jim Clapper's analysis of the situation (and numerous "anonymous sources") and espousing it as fact. 
Now, admittedly, using publicly available information, it's impossible to prove that WL didn't knowingly or unknowingly get [100% authentic] leaks from RU intelligence. But the lack of evidence, the fact that the official narrative is inconsistent with the facts, and that alternative explanations haven't been adequately refuted causes me to remain skeptical.

Back then, the price of bitcoin was a more affordable $474 per token — less than half the price of an ounce of gold.

Sure, but those people are pretty fringe, at least in the United States. 
Comparing other political ideologies to those who proclaim to follow "real socialism" is kind of a waste of time. 
There are larger parties that call themselves socialist (ie: democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders) and they don't believe in that form of wealth redistribution. These groups are also slowly realizing that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will result in better organizational transparency/governance.

I used to be a huge proponent of buying things purse.io and I've probably ordered about 20-30 things from them, but after dealing with their customer service I'll give you some words of warning:
It could take *weeks* for your order to arrive. Specifically, I ordered something that should've come amazon prime, but for some reason (purse.io tried to blame Amazon), it came from a non-prime seller and was mailed from Taiwan. It took like 2.5 weeks for it to arrive.

He's *almost* there, in terms of people who don't understand how PGP works. (I would hope that whoever investigates him at ATO takes at least a few hours to learn the basics of cryptography.)
Here's a rough timeline:
* Gavin publicly states CSW is SN. 
* CSW publishes his blog post (which apparently differs significantly from what Gavin thought it would be.)
* People start saying Gavin is incompetent, his commit access should be revoked, etc.
* Then a day later Gavin says he has been bamboozled. 
Craig's version will be, "The chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation confirmed that I am SN, but then other experts bullied him into recanting his claim. This is why nobody else is confirming that it's me." 
My prediction is that CSW will find a few more people who are willing to fall for his schtick, and will continue to build up circumstantial evidence in support of his hoax. Probably manages to stay out of prison too. 
It takes a couple of days for a layperson to really understand how cryptography works (shout out to [Dan Boneh's coursera]( and from the outside, **this whole "bitcoin thing" looks really complicated/intimidating so all of CSW's explanations and circuitous way of proving his identity appears reasonable**.

They also included a killswitch in the first and second variant.

Sure. It's a ton of money for an effort that couldn't have taken more than a few weeks. (Because that's how long the exploit has been public.)
But there's opportunity cost:
With a little more effort they could've written the same worm but instead of ransomware they could've targeted organizations, quietly exfiltrated passwords or other information and made much bigger profits in the long run.  
They've shined a very bright spotlight on this vulnerability, millions of people are patching their computers now.

It sounds to me like the thing holding you back is actually the lack of internet access. If Uzbeks were able to browse the internet for less than $40/Gb then learning about bitcoin, etc. would be a lot easier. 
I would look into starting a meshnet. Get a high end satellite internet plan, sell the bandwidth, teach others how to do the same. If you can provide uncensored internet access for cheaper than anyone else, and it only accepts bitcoin for payment, then you'll incentivize bitcoin adoption.
