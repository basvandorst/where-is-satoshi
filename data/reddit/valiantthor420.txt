Use Electrum instead. No need to download the blockchain if you use that.

Too bad most of those will be denied since they are only offering to 5 states.

You have to buy the CryptoPro app. It's like $5 or something. Once you have that you can setup your portfolio. Then when the watch face is set to modular you will see the price of BTC and the first 3 alts that you have listed in your portfolio.

It's better in Modular face because it can show you btc plus 3 other coins of your choice.

Don't underestimate the power of the Bitcoin Longs

This guy doesn't even know what he's talking about...lmfao.

"Being long Bitcoin is beautiful." Sure is!
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:27:05
LMFAO!

Yeah he's good. I just came across his channel yesterday and also subscribed. I agree, he is very calm and collective during his debates and his facts seem dead on.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:09:08
I agree! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:14:08
I'm sure he's now under investigation after his recent comments.

I sold my BCH on GDAX.com for a little over 4K USD. You can try to set a sell order there for something like 4K and wait for the pump. As long as you do a limit sell you avoid fees. And there isn't any fee to takeout your BTC, at least that is my understanding.

We have spies down voting... lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:10
i bet you he still holds his BTC. he's just manipulating the market in his favor. Hence why he doesn't see anything wrong with insider trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:27:40
lol right!
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:11:53
Good move! Mine arrives tomorrow!

This is why you just claim losses from all the various things that we have been scammed on. For example the LTCgear.com scam. Josh Garza's bullshit hashlets, etc.

So does their own Amazon Logistics carrier.

Hmm lets see... Roger Ver and John McAfee both come to mind.

Thank you for sharing this. This literally made me LOL. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:21:54

@_date: 2017-07-20 21:52:49
