Yea, 45 here. I gave up talking about it in 2014.

I see you don't have them on a registered car. Don't blame you :).  Keeping them as an investment? 
I only know this because I was checking what was available last week.

Wow....that takes me back... Feels like a thousand years ago. Time moves fast in the crypto world :) 
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:31:11
Yea, I'm very surprised by it's resilience.. I've gambled on it going down to at least 2000, in the short term. The next couple of weeks could be very be interesting. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:41:45
That the was trick.... It wasn't meant to be taken seriously ;) 
It was a fun, light hearted collective in the beginning. Plus it was created by a fellow Aussie :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:31:35
I did the opposite,  sold at near the top 2700. I'm still waiting for it to go below 2000 before I rebuy. 
I must say I'm surprised how resilient the price has been. Could bite me on the arse, but that's part of the fun :) 
But I originally bought in at 800, so nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I should add though, that this prediction only relates to today's gains, if that . While I believe we'll see a drop over the next few weeks, it will consist of lots of ups and downs. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:28:40
Surely.... Selling... And then buying back in at a lower price is about as close to shorting we can get? 
Bought at 800, sold at 2700...will rebuy at....????

For anyone into quad racing. I've used them before, no complaints. Ship globally.

Satoshi,  the pizza guy, and the hodl man..... Bitcoin Legends... Lol
Regardless of the future,  these people will all be part of Bitcoin history. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:12:42
I hope you are right... will make for a lot of happy Bitcoiners :). 
But looking at a two week zoom of the Poloniex BTC /USD chart,  I suspect we're in the middle of what will become the third downward spike. Trading volumes have been decreasing consistently since the last   downward spike. I'm waiting for the profit takers to jump in. 
Of course I've been wrong many times before :) 
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:18:10
I'll see you on the other side  :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:21:24
Just looking at Poloniex. BTC/USD
The rising price,  on ever decreasing volumes, could be signalling a reversal. 
Looks like fatigue is kicking in.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:28:56
Sorry, meant reversal of the increasing price... So yes... A drop :) 
I know most of us are waiting for it, just wondering when. 
Maybe I should have said "the reversal"... Lol
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:31:19
Sorry folks my fault...... I put a small amount on some alt coins last night... hoping to make a little extra BTC. So...  of course everything crashes. Seriously... I'm cursed. 
I'm the guy who puts money on a horse.....which then dies half way through the race.

Not sure if the good people of Venezuela would say that Fiat is stable :) 
Regarding Bitcoin stability... Surely the larger the user base, the more stable the price would become???.  If a lot more people were using it as regular currency,  versus speculation, that would surely reduce the impact of daily trade activity?? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:52:48
I hope your right :)..   But I suspect we're in the consolidation phase, as happened in mid January 2014.  Of course MtGox happened in February, so maybe this will be different. Fingers crossed :) 
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:15:26
Cool. Good score.  Here's hoping, for your sake,  I see them attached to a Ferrari some day :) 
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:37:01
Great advice this. 
I've been involved with Cryptocurrency since early 2014. There have been highs and lows,  and long periods of nothingness. Glad to have a little bit of excitement....  but keep your cool people :) 
P. S.   Dogecoin was my introduction to the scene. What a crazy f...ing ride that was... Lol. Plenty of lessons learnt. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:53:55
As I said..... Lessons learnt.... Lol
