Incorrect, while it is true there is a government granted monopoly, you are implying without that government granted monopoly, competition would flourish.  Nothing could be further from the truth. It really depends on which region of the country you are talking about but for much of the US, wired internet is a natural monopoly where only one provider would be able to profitably provide service.  Population density is hugely important in determining whether or not there would be multiple providers in a fictitious free market.

That's just ridiculous, Infrastructure is insanely expensive.  Especially if you don't have the power of government eminent domain to force people to allow companies to build infrastructure in the most efficient way possible (i.e. a utility wants to build out cables for internet but i won't allow them to go over my property forcing them to take a longer circuitous way to do it to hook everyone up in my neighborhood).
I have history on my side.  In the 1800's, England had a free market system for water utilities and people were moving to the edges of towns expanding the size of cities.  The water utilities expanded but soon realized they couldn't even recoup the costs of building out that infrastructure because they were fiercely competing on price with each other and stopped building out that infrastructure as the cities expanded and their profits dropped to nothing. As a result, people actually died without access to water.  England then either nationalized the utilities or granted regional monopolies and expansion and service went back to normal.  
Also, the reason why Wilson North Carolina started a local municipally backed fiber network for it's citizens is because Time Warner, the local monopoly there, didn't even want to expand to the outskirts of the town because they couldn't even profitably provide the citizens in the outskirts internet service as a monopoly, the idea that this would have worked with competitors is laughable.

Man, you don't even make bad arguments backed up by bad facts, all you attempt to do is cheerlead libertarian mantras backed by nothing.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:00:43
Probably not, it takes just one asshole to ruin plans for infrastructure rollout in a theoretical libertarian society. You may not like eminent domain, but it makes it far cheaper to build infrastructure. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:33:44
This is incorrect. Some industries (mostly utilities) have such high fixed costs that only one provider would be able to profitably provide service to everyone (edit: some areas wouldn't even have a monopoly provider, see discussion in later replies).  What you're saying is that a potential competitor would be so stupid that they wouldn't be able to do basic math and think they could charge just a LITTLE bit less than the current monopolist, spend billions on rolling out competing service, but then what happens is fierce competition would make prices dive into the red and both companies would go bankrupt because they can't even break even over their fixed costs.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:10:19
*The threat of competition is sufficient to keep prices in check.*
No investor is going to look at a monpolists price gouging profits and insanely high fixed costs and say, 'gee, if i elbow my way into his customer base, i could just charge a bit less and make a ton of money'.  No, they're going to be rational and realize that there would probably be a price war and they end up both losing because they won't be even able to break even because of the extremely high fixed costs.
*So then why the Government granted monopoly?*
Because the provider agrees to provide service to both the profitable and unprofitable parts of the area (some populations are so sparsely populated it doesn't even make sense for a monopolist to provide service to those people unless there are more densely populated areas to make up for it).
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:27:40
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:45:38
Yes, we may as well end the conversation because the key point is:
*insanely high fixed costs*
THAT is the difference, and you trying to shoehorn other industries into that argument is batshit retarded, different industries have different barriers to entry, utilities being typically the highest with the highest fixed costs. You have zero idea how to run a business or invest in one.  
Again, I have history on my side:
*I have history on my side. In the 1800's, England had a free market system for water utilities and people were moving to the edges of towns expanding the size of cities. The water utilities expanded but soon realized they couldn't even recoup the costs of building out that infrastructure because they were fiercely competing on price with each other and stopped building out that infrastructure as the cities expanded and their profits dropped to nothing.

Not even monopolists want to service certain geographical locations because it's so unprofitable to do so.  And this brings another history lesson: This is why the Tennessee Valley Authority was created by the Federal Government: Many rural Americans couldn't even get electricity because it was unprofitable to build out the infrastructure for them, EVEN WITH A PRIVATE MONOPOLY.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:53:15
Because, they're supposed to serve both profitable and unprofitable geographic areas in a given state, otherwise they'd just pick and choose and people in sparsely populated areas wouldn't get service from anyone, government granted monopoly or not.

They already fuck with netflix and youtube soooooooooo yes it's more than possible. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:11:21
Well, at least you implicitly admit that some areas wouldn't have competition (or even a single provider). Baby steps i guess.  I'm not going to argue about whether someone who lives in a rural area deserves broadband or not, that's a moral issue, but i'm clearly right about the issue of natural monopolies. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:53:36
"Peaceful" and "Voluntary" interaction is great when you're talking about food or widgets, but for utilities, it is extremely complicated and expensive because of property rights and fixed costs and it doesn't work neatly as you would think in your imaginary free market situation.  Again, people actually died as a result of applying free market ideology to water utilities.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:28:14
Many of these are from positive externalities provided by the government (see: Nasa/military).
Also: 
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:26:09
Yes, in my example, the monopoly couldn't even profitably provide service to all of the citizens in the town, think about that for a second and what that implies for a competitor who might want to barge in and set up competition in a theoretical free market example.  The mistake you're making is thinking competitors would be flocking there if it weren't for the gosh darn government being in the way.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:04:07
Yeah you would.  I just thought of another example: many people in rural America couldn't even get electricity from a private provider until the Tennessee Valley Authority was created by the federal government to build it out.

Yes, that indicates elites (aka moderators) added those links in.  
1. It's stupid to associate a currency to a political movement (especially one related to basement dwelling neckbeards that repel normal people) when you're trying to popularize it
2.  Based on the downvotes and upvotes in this thread, it seems people in this COMMUNITY are agreeing with me and disagreeing with you.

Gotcha. How much did the price of Bitcoin lose during the last weekend crash?  Did it last all weekend or is there a small window?

Actually they could stop it easily, by outlawing it, if other governments do the same, it will crash further.

Again, people like you are the reason why there isn't a mass adoption of bitcoin. Also, how many of those Chinese do you think are libertarians? Or anyone who just pump and dumps/speculates/day trades bitcoins, are they true believing libertarians like yourself?

@_date: 2013-12-18 16:45:18
Do you have a source on this? Do you personally know the political philosophy of everyone who is involved?  Posts like these are why the bitcoin community is turning to shit and indirectly causing bitcoin to become viewed as some crazy neck bearded libertarian's play thing and not a serious currency.
Edit: Although with the downvotes you're getting, it seems some people in the sub agree with me.

Also, holy shit, did you just say, 'Bitcoin spells the end for left wing politics and government control' when hardly anyone uses it yet and China just caused bitcoin to lose more than half of value by EXERCISING it's control? Yeah, libertarians such as yourself need to STFU with your Jim Jones kool-aid drinking rhetoric so Bitcoin can actually recover and be of use.

Yeah, all the businesses adding bitcoin to their payment options, which they're only doing contingent on the fact that they IMMEDIATELY swap it out back for USD.  Which was the point i made earlier.  You not hearing is definitely one of your problems.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:40:18
If everyone trades bitcoin for cash rather than keeping it and saving it, guess what happens to the value of bitcoin, genius.  Bitcoin needs to be saved and spent and then saved again, rather than currently where it's mostly pumped and dumped for US Dollars and the few that are actually spent on goods and services are mostly converted back into USD via bitpay/coinbase

No, most American libertarians (right libertarians/minarchists) believe that there should be a minimal amount of government to enforce property rights, however, left libertarians (the original meaning of libertarianism) believe that such an arrangement is coercive and believe there should be NO government.

Yeah, good luck getting Amazon or your average brick and mortar shop to use bitcoin if the government bans it.  What are you going to do, hide an entire shop in your rectum so the government doesn't find it? Dear god you are delusional.
