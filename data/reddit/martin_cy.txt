I actually installed the app on my android tablet, but since I'm in europe i did not even have the "Identity Verifications" once i logged in on the app.. just no option.. not only I that had that problem its mentioned regularly on the support forums.. so i gave up.

I tried setting up an account on coinbase but after 2 days of never getting passed the taking pictures using their shit flash plugin i gave up and deleted my account..
i tried from 3 laptops and one PC (running windows 8 + ubuntu 14.04 latest) both from IE 10, latest version of firefox, latest version of chrome, from one android tablet and one blackberry phone.. on one laptop i manage to actually use the camera, but the button in the flash app to take snapshot didn't work.. and i wasted hours, and in the end i was very pissed off and just deleted my account and went on bitcoin.de and bought some coins from there instead. 
if they get their shit together i might consider opening an account again but it really better be easy.. as it is now its unusable.. i guess they dont really want new people..

ya its a good one, as well as the articles Dan Held have written on it PoW energy usage.. its just so tiering to argue with these people that are excited that they found something "new" to use to make bitcoin the enemy of the people.. when it is the opposite..

next step, ban selfies, you know how much energy is used to store and transmit selfies world wide? its probably substantially more that BTC mining.. but never mind that.. its the PC thing to do now to jump on BTC's energy usage.. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:30:46
as long as BTC mining is using less then 51% of all produced energy that humanity has access too its not enough. need to protect against that 51% attack..

that would be cool, so what they say that BTC mining will be what propel us to take the steps to become a Type 2 Civilization :D

of course, any transaction you do that is not just to your own personal keys should go via wasabi, that is my new philosophy.. unfortunately i'm a bit of hodler so I dont do that many transaction except for the monthly salary conversion to BTC..  
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:17:12
it is not that hard, been meaning to write an article on how to do it in practice.. maybe I will. 
 
when you just hodl extra security is quite cheap, and who knows long term.. if we start counting btc value in satoshis because no normal person would deal with BTC as a coin directly anymore.. then extra privacy now will be worth a lot then..

great little usage of wasabi wallet is that you use it as transit wallet between your long term hardware wallet and exchanges.. sure it might take a bit longer to move your funds to and from exchange by having it filter through your wasabi wallet but it does cut down on the links between your KYCed exchange accounts and your hopefully more anonymous long term storage.

l[ buy another ledger or three, 50% off today till 26th. but, Opsec says do not order to your home address.. no need for a company that sells wallets that can hold millions to have a list of address of owners.. BTC might not be super much worth today.. but in 10 years, a list of home address for early ledger buyers might be quite the hot commodity for criminal gangs.. no need to expose yourself to the wrench gang.

if we start thinking in satoshis, which will happen soon or later we can keep it.. 1 million = 0.01 BTC, 1 BTC = 100 million satohsis, so a billionaire will have 10 BTC..  a trillionaire has 10k BTC..  that should cover most cases :D

got samurai on my phone so might bounce via that.... that would take me to current setup:
* Fiat in bank account -&gt; Exchange buy BTC.
* BTC -&gt; Samurai wallet on phone (to a 3xxx address)
* Samurai wallet -&gt;  wasabi wallet, native Segwit (bc1xxx address)
* coinjoin wasabi transfer to new hardware wallet address
accessing hardware wallet via Electrum, that connects to my local "Electrum personal server" which connects to my private full node that only has one peer, via vpn, my public full node running on a seed box paid with btc.

pinging could you maybe clear this up and maybe elaborate on what the plans for the BTC minimum limit for CoinJoin in wasabi?
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:43:05
finally! great stuff.. cuts my privacy ops by one step! woohoo.
* Bank -&gt; exchange
* Exchange -&gt; Wasabi wallet (benc32 only)
* Wasabi coinJoin -&gt; Hardware wallet for long term storage.  
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:31:05
wow that was very well put. thanks.

only problem is of course that most exchanges do not support the "bc*" address yet for withdrawal.. which is annoying.. so then you have to bounce the transaction via something else.. still trying out what is the best option for that..
