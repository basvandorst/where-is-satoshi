If you buy a coffee with Bitcoin, are you gonna wait 3-6 confirmations?
No. Pretty much EVERY point of sale situation uses 0-conf. And it works. The notion that 0-conf transactions would be unsafe, was largely nonsense (some exotic corner cases aside). Now with Peter Todd's horrible RBF patch, this may change. Still don't know how the hell that came accepted for Core, as I don't see what problem this solves, yet it creates very actual and real problems for many cases in which Bitcoin currently works perfectly and is being used every day.

Except it doesn't say "Bill doesn't care". It says "Bill understands the reality that there are challenges, but that they can and will be overcome".
Indeed, the guy put forward good points, but drew the wrong conclusion. Considering Bitcoin failed or dead is fucking idiocy.
Both overreacting and underreacting (ignoring) are stupid. Bill is smart.

If you send a "normal" tx, that is: no dust, no ridiculously low fee, normal amounts, no long chain of unspent UTXOs etc. In other words, a tx that propagates normally throughout the network and gets relayed by every regular node out there.
Within one to two seconds after sending this tx, **you won't be able to replace it** (i.e. doing a double spend). At least not without RBF, that is.
People keep claiming it's so easy to do a double spend, but that's only with corner cases. Yes, I can easily do a double spend. No, not with a normal payment (criteria above).

I had dinner in a restaurant yesterday, paid with Bitcoin. Went to the bakery this morning to get some fresh bread, paid with Bitcoin. Then I filled up my car at the gas station before I drove to work, paid with Bitcoin. I just paid my telecom provider's monthly invoice for my phone/internet connection with Bitcoin. 
So, no, it's very much alive.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:10:15
Yeah, that's a really good metaphor. It's virtually the same thing. 
It's more like: Bill has the flu. Mike Hearn declares him terminal. Bill knows there are medicines that are very likely to cure him. So Bill acknowledges the fact that he's sick, and that he has to take appropriate action, but by no means does Bill panic or believe his fate is sealed.
Replace flu by spanish fever or premature stages of cancer, if that suits your argument better. I think the point is clear.
YES there are problems, and YES action is necessary to address them. NO it's not to late yet, and claiming it's already over ("it has failed") is simply ridiculous.
By the way, in your metaphor, Bill would be underreacting: accepting things the way they are and not taking action at all. Bill won't underreact. Not to his cancer, and not to Mike Hearn's forecast of doom.

I read a lot of techno babble.
Reality: zero conf **works**, and does so in a very safe manner.
No, theoretically it's not safe. Theoretically there is zero guarantee. Theoretically, only a confirmation is what protects against a doublespend.
Practically, however, the fact that first-seen is standard throughout virtually 100% of the nodes (which was not going to chance any time soon, until this ridiculous RBF patch somehow made it into Core) made sure that, given reasonable circumstances, you could accept normal payments with zero confirmations are a very acceptable probability (as in, virtually 100%) of actually getting your money.
MUCH more probability than, say, a credit card payment. Theoretically, credit cards are the most unsecure, unsafe, untrustworthy payment method there is. Does that seem like a good reason for merchants to stop accepting credit cads, or for banks to deliberately disable card readers? 
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:57:39


Also true, but I wasn't referring to p2p or not p2p. *Centralized or decentralized* is the main criterium here.
This bank-owned "blockchain" is not decentralized, thus defeating the very characteristic that was the main feature of the Bitcoin blockchain to begin with: **decentralization**. By creating an independent, trustworthy payment system that doesn't rely on, and requires no trust in, **any 3rd party or authority**. 
This is exactly NOT what bank want, and thus specifically not what their "blockchain" will be all about.

Christ, not this technical analysis bullcrap again :(
Wanna make a bet? For 30 days in a row, you predict, based on whatever retracement levels or fibonacci numbers or bull/bear flags or golden ratio patterns or whatever black magic voodoo approach you prefer, whether the price will be up or down at 12:00 pm UTC the next day. 
If technical analysis would work perfectly, you'd theoretically get a 100% score. If technical analysis is total utter bullshit and you might as well throw a dice or have a monkey choose between two bananas labeled 'up' an 'down', i.e. just make a total random guess, you'd theoretically get a 50% score.
So if you attain 75% or more, I pay you a bitcoin. If you score below 75%, you pay me a bitcoin.

any chance you can add support for detecting txs with peter todd's ~~doublespend hack~~ RBF property set?
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:02:51


What do you base this on? As a long term, high frequency Bitcoin user, I'd say 75% of my bitcoin transactions ARE with retailers. I do at least one every day, I'd say several on average daily. Same goes for many people in my social circle. I know *many* Bitcoin enthusiasts who use Bitcoin for as much payments as possible, of which retail is a great deal.
People seem to be unaware of this and still think Bitcoin is mainly an online thing, but Bitcoin is also largely used in retail situations. You may not like it or use it this way, but it's happening.
And I think this is all for the better! Because visible, face to face, every day regular payments with Bitcoin causes more awareness, makes the acceptance grow, and makes people familiar with it. **It just helps mass adoption of Bitcoin a great deal.** People actually seeing Bitcoin happen in front of them makes them much more susceptible for it than all virtual techno crypto cyber stuff for and by a bunch of nerds.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:13:12


Care to elaborate? Currently, almost all nodes use first-seen, it's the de facto standard in Bitcoin Core (and I don't know of any other common node implementations that use another strategy, apart form maybe some rare custom built exceptions). 
Normal txs are relayed throughout the network within seconds. Thus, within 2-3 seconds, a tx is almost fully propagated, thus making it virtually impossible to still broadcast a 2nd (double spending) tx and getting it propagated successfully. 
Merchant accepting 0-conf can quite easily increase their odds: as soon as they see an incoming tx, keep probing at other nodes in the network if they have the same tx in their mempool for like 2-3 seconds (I think there are also APIs providing similar functionality). If that's the case, a potential fraudster will have a very low probability of still getting their doublespend tx relayed.
The merchant's software could even further increase their defense by automatically relaying an incoming tx directly to all miner IPs they know. 
I know you know more about Bitcoin than I do. Exactly where in the above line of thinking am I mistaken?
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:48:43
It's only relevant for at most 30-40 years or so, after that, block rewards will be insignificant to mining fees anyway.
And so far, Bitcoin has *already* doubled like 12 times or so, i.e. making up for 48 years.

Sorry, I have no idea what this is. What is a 'sequence' ?
And I'm aware of the risk of unconfirmed RBF inputs, yes. It makes this entire RBF thing all the more of a pain in the ass to deal with. I really regret that Peter Todd somehow got his way, despite of all the resistance against it (and total lack of actual necessity, let alone urgency).

Do you have something similar to this for APIs as well? I know some of the sites listed above provide API functionality as well (such as BlockTrail.com, Blockr.io, BlockCypher.com, Chain.com, etc).
It would be great to have an up to date list of Blockchain APIs as well, where you can pull blockchain data (like an address' balance, transaction details, etc) from web apps through API calls.
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:28:39
Is that true? It sounds rather low, and I assume it will vary a lot depending on the area you measure. 
But sure, in that case, a limit increase of 17.7% per year sounds reasonable.
Or in fact, I'd rather say: 25% increase when there have been 50,000 almost full blocks since the previous limit increase (where 'almost full' means &gt;95% of the max block size or something). This way it takes at least a year, but longer if the current limit doesn't appear to be a bottleneck.

That's not how mining works. You solve a hash for a complete block *including transactions*. You cannot solve a block first, and then decide which or how many txs you will include.
Also, the following is not how supply and demand works:


If miners know this, they can decide to not accept txs with less than 10 or 100 satoshis fee. Even if not all miners stick to this, and a few (say 1 out of N) will go as low as 5 or even 1 satoshi, it means it will take your 1 sat fee tx about N blocks before getting confirmed. For some people or use cases, this will be too slow and they'll be happy to pay the 5 or 10 or even 100 sat.  
If the required fee is too high, users won't pay it. If the offered fee is too low, miners won't include it. A price equilibrium will work out itself.

Yeah, I was referring to a limit as in "upper bound". Nonetheless it's generally agreed upon that there can be ever only at most 21 million bitcoins. Probably less (as bitcoins get lost), not more.

Sure, I agree, 4 exahash/sec is actually a remarkable accomplishment. And if the mining hashrate would continue to increase with the same growth factor as we've seen in the past few years, I guess we would be able to do a full sha256 (or sha256d) brute force within a matter of decades. 
But exponential growth is not sustainable (even though economists sometimes tend to think differently).
I find it very hard to believe that we're able to keep multiplying and multiplying the hashrate for many more years to come. The famous picture of the sun does actually hold some truth. Even when we have to bruteforce a search space of "only" 2^160 instead of 2^256, taking all the theoretically optimal thermodynamics and stuff into account, it's still an *incredibly* huge number. 
And at least in the foreseeable future we are limited to planet earth, we don't even have a Dyson sphere yet to convert 100% of the sun's energy into hashing power :)

I'm curious to hear what they consider to be their added value over technologies like Bitcoin, which allow you to transfer money worldwide, instantly, 100% safe, without requiring or trusting or depending on any company or service provider or other 3rd party, without limitations or restrictions, at virtually no cost.

1: Better technology may come along. However, first of all Bitcoin is not finished yet. If a better idea comes along and it's really a fundamental improvement, then what's keeping us from integrating that into Bitcoin as well? 
Second, the success of Bitcoin is *way* more that just the technology. After 7 years, the eco system of business and services around Bitcoin, the market acceptance and adoption rate, the user base, the network size, and so on.. This is *extremely* crucial for Bitcoin or a potential successor. So just better technology certainly won't replace Bitcoin by itself.
2: Increased number of file sizes? What? I assume you're talking about the size of the blockchain. Currently, the entire blockchain, containing ALL of Bitcoin's world wide balance history and transaction data of over 7 years, fits on less than $2 of disk space. **Two U.S. dollars worth of storage space**. Exactly what was the problem, again?
3: Anonimity has nothing to do with them being able to freeze or seize your bitcoins. Even if they know who you are, they can't take your bitcoins. But the anonimity thing is a non-issue. Even if you have to buy bitcoins through exchanges where you have to identify yourself, you can anonymize them immediately through tumblers, mixers, coinjoin, pooled wallets, and plenty other of options.
More importantly, buying bitcoins with fiat is not the only way to get bitcoins. Do you currently buy your Euros or US dollars or whatever fiat currency you use? Probably not. No, you can *earn* them, by getting paid for your products or services directly in bitcoin. When Bitcoin hits mainstream adoption, this will be common.
4: Currently, this is certainly a problem. I expect (and hope) this will stabalize if more and more people are getting into Bitcoin and start using it. The larger the market, the less influence from buy ins or sell offs. 
Second, like you said, it's volatile when compared to fiat. More exact, it's volatile as long as we keep expressing the value of one bitcoin in terms of fiat money. If Bitcoin would become a major currency (and make no mistake, I have no illusions that this will happen anytime soon, but *if*) then it doesn't matter how much euros or pounds or dollars it's worth. A bitcoin is worth 1 BTC, and that'll be pretty damn stable.

Nice, yes, I fully agree, the openness or transparency is the key factor for Bitcoin's the trustworthiness. Or actually 'trustlessness' since trust is not required, anyone can personally verify everything.

If you have an Android or iOS device, get [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( For Windows phone, [Copay]( is great.
They're fairly easy to use, and more importantly: they have an excellent, fool-proof backup procedure.
The biggest risk of buying your first bitcoins is messing something up with the wallet software and accidentally losing the bitcoins. By making a proper backup (which you need to do only once with above wallets), preferably *before* buying the bitcoins, you're safe.

Dollars are known to be commonly used for gambling and other doubtful or even downright criminal activities. Dollars are not subject to strict rules. Bitcoin are.

It's not like if there's only a few or even one miner left, nobody else can ever resume mining anymore.
If this theoretical last remaining miner imposes limits, there's an obvious market opportunity for other potential miners who can do the same for slightly more fee, without the limits. The market will decide.
Let alone the fact that if there's only a few or even one miner left, mining would become **extremely** cheap (as in, virtually free) so *way* before that happens, new competition will jump aboard.

Moreover, I don't see the problem with this 10 minute confirmation at all. For the vast majority of payments, the confirmation time doesn't matter. Whenever I buy something with Bitcoin, I never have to care about confirmations whatsoever.

I get to keep 100% control *and* 100% convenience. 
Nonetheless I'm all for diversity, the more choice the better, and in all honesty I wasn't exactly sure of how a BitGo wallet was set up until what you explained here.

Sorry, I understand what you're saying (and I agree) but I fail to see how's that relevant.
The ability to clone Bitcoin, modify it a little, and launch a new cryptocurrency (which then **by definition is not Bitcoin**) with a different limit, doesn't change anything about Bitcoin's limit. 
It's "set in stone" in the sense that there isn't a single person (or small group of persons) who can currently do something, such as changing some source code or anything, that would result in more than 21 million bitcoins coming into existence. A majority in the entire Bitcoin community would have to agree upon this.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:01:54
Truly amazing to see what's happening there. I hope real life bitcoin payments like this will help gaining positive attention from newbies, showing them that **Bitcoin actually works** instead of the endless stream of FUD they get from mainstream media.

Sorry for the late reply. First of all you seem to be *very* mining-oriented. Mining is not what Bitcoin is about at all. Yes, it's an important (or even essential) technical part of Bitcoin, but it's not the most important aspect. If you're just starting with Bitcoin, or getting into it and want to purchase, use, receive, and spend your first bitcions, do not bother about mining at all. It doesn't matter. 
Furthermore there are no "companies" who process secure data on your PC. You process the data. And it's not a matter of 'processing enough data', it's a matter of being the first to publish a  cryptographically secured block of transaction. Which takes a lot of computing power, it's basically a brute force search. So the faster your computer, the more likely you are to be the first to find the next block.

If RBF becomes commonly used amongst nodes, it will kill a HUGE deal of Bitcoin usage in every day practice. Unfortunately, it's exactly this physical, point of sale, every day usage of Bitcoin that makes it more visible and known amongst the mass audience. Would be a shame to see that end.

Not if Satoshi already setup a tx (but never broadcasted it) from the first block as a precautionary measure, moving coins to another address of his own. And now Craig somehow got hold of this tx (which is plausible because there was and still is no security risk involved for Satoshi, it's just a tx that moves coins between his own wallets). 
Why on earth can't Craig just sign a message, like Charlie Lee did with Litecoin. It's 100% bogus.
