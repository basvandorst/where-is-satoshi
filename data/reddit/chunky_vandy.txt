Question... what do you do if the App server goes down or is comprised? How do you move funds the ?

I don’t understand. Why doesn’t everyone just boycott coinbase?

DDO is a new peer to peer decentralised currency. You can use it to buy knives and spoons... if you’ve played that before.

Imma try it.

What is this bitcoin cash that everyone talks about. I thought it was called Bitmain cash...?
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:16:53
Why don’t we join and help correct them over there?
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:57:02
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:27:22
I've really only heard negative things about coin base though. And would I be better keeping my currency offline?

All a matter of comparison I guess. Probably one of the better ones on the list.

Good on ya champ. Good luck. Read up on ADA and Monero. ����

I wish someone would introduce me. I want in but it's all so overwhelming.

@_date: 2017-11-10 20:43:43
Well that’s just great. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:07:26
&lt;3 slush!
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:15:11
That would be possible... if people could actually sell their btc. But when you transaction remains unconfirmed, btc can’t fully crash haha
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:29:55
That’s horrifying. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:40:23
Those using bitcoin to buy drugs are mad. 
Use Monero v29.0.98.9

I got Blockchain and used cash in person with a bit rocket atm. It's was sooo easy. I can't believe I didn't do it sooner. Just do it mate. It's never too late. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:26:19
Running bitcoin over tor actually compromises tor. I can’t remember the source, but the community there found that Blockchain weakened the anonymity of the network. 
Just use a hardware wallet if you’re that concerned.

I wanted to. The wife wouldn't let me. Turns out it was a good move. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:08:24
But you missed a few critical points:
•Bob is a top bloke and only chooses good friends. 
•Alice is a top chick and doesn’t share secrets. 
•Our secret is safe with Alice. 
•If you have no secrets to hide, why should you worry.

It's people like you that make this happen. Good on ya. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:04:28
It was actually a combination of birthday monies and random cash jobs so I reckon I tick that box!!

One thing I've learned in this time is that the buyers win and the sellers lose.

That’s satisfying!!

No that you mention it. Yea. I'm in Australia, so our cash smells like plastic from refined urine.

I've done enough research now to know that it will pay to be a long term investor. It might even pay to turn my eyes away from the rates for a few years and skip the drama. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:54:30
Thanks for helping me get a better understanding 
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:12:07
I'm on Blockchain but I would love to go offline/hardware. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:08:07
I asked a few questions on this forum and everyone was always super helpful. I think it was also a gradual move in the right direction with the right help. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:09:34

Thanks! I'm in it for the long haul! An investment for my newborn daughter.

Thanks. So if I literally do nothing, I reap the benefits of both?
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:33:03
There are some great resources regarding contracting for bitcoin on the r/Bitcoin FAQ page
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:36:43
Solid advice. 
I even keep a backup of my backup in a fireproof safe. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:19:23
This was most helpful. Thanks heaps.

I actually truly don’t understand how the new tokens are given. I’d love to see what people have to say to this. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:07:09
Genius 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:35:35
Your first statement is incorrect. Monero is all of those things. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:09:56
But is there a chance that a forked coin could replace btc as the leader and become more valuable?
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:01:05
Nice. Much better. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:21:33
Isn’t it called Bitmain Cash?
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:20:15
Amazing 
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:28:59
How many times must I say this. Boycott coinbase. 
On the other hand, Wikileaks should definitely be using Monero.
