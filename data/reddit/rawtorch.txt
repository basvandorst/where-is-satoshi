Well Nicehash got hacked for 60 million a bit ago so take that as you will.

Invest as much as you are willing to lose. Expect to lose it so any gain is a plus.

Nice guide man! Electrum is great.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:21:32
I can second this, Electrum is great.

Sorry to hear about your dog :(
I'd be willing to go into very deep debt if it meant my dog would survive, your decision is the correct one in my opinion.

I totally get what you mean, but if you leave whatever you initially invested, still made almost 4 times what you invested, plus there's the chance of making even more! I have a friend who bought about 10 BTC when they were 10 dollars each, over time he's spent 8.5 of them, always making sure to hold a couple just in case, and now he has 1.5 fucking BTC! for pretty much 15 dollars! He never thought it would even reach 2000, but look at him now, thousands of dollars richer. Do whatever you want, its 100% you choice, but I just wanted to make this point because i've seen someone make a lot of money by saving some.

I bought about 70 dollars worth at the price it's at right now, just buy and hodl

I think it's not the best idea to cash out now, if you really need to i'd recommend only cashing out half or whatever part you need so you atleast have some riding the roller coaster, imagine if it reaches 100k, you're gonna regret selling all of them now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:44:17
I'm not saying you don't have to sell some, as long as you keep a couple. But holding them all is what I would do right now.
And I'm not sure about the software, I just always have this open on my 3rd monitor and in my phone browser and I just check it a lot.

I just bought 70 dollars worth hoping to see gains in the future, planning to hodl through all the drops and crashes until it hopefully goes up beyond the moon.

It went over 11k a few days ago though?
