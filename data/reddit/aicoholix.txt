They probably hate liars or people spreading fud but they definitely do not hate their users. One of the most friendly and responsive dev teams I've come across.

Anon135246 here! I have received the payment. Like I said in my email, I will keep sending in websites when I run into them. You're doing a great thing for the bitcoin community, especially giving ' unknown' companies a lot more exposure. I think this will also help bitcoin in general.

Hey Bobby! Thanks for doing this AMA. Would you consider to sell the BTCC blocks unfunded so people can use it as a cold storage? I am sure a lot of people would love to own that beautiful block but it is a bit pricey for a lot of collectors.

Care to share how much you paid for them?

The guy has "obvious parody account" in his bio so he is following Twitter rules.

Encourage merchants to use BTCpay instead.

Your interview with Craig looks like BSV propoganda. No critical questions and no fact checking. You're a blogger, not a journalist.

Does this still work?

Haha I didn't know Reddit silver was an actual thing. Cheers!

It's just a metal wallet. Why is he calling it a hardware wallet?

Would it also be possible to swap Altcoin -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; USD in cases where altcoins (supported by BTCpay) don't have USD pairs?

Are you selling? If so, how much per 20 seeds?

*mic drop*

I read somewhere that BTCpay will also support other altcoin (as long as they write the integration).
If one of these alts doesn't have a fiat support on exchanges would it be possible to modify ExchangeSharp to make Altcoin -&gt; BTC -&gt; fiat swaps?

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this is due to the new FATF regulations.

Create a Twitter account and post the video as a reply to every tweet they make.

The CSW tweet was made 17 hours ago. A bit late for April fools don't you think?
His attitude did a 180 over the past few months. Something is up.

Are you still using coinbase? I've heard some negative stories about it.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:24:21
I heard they aren't secure enough. Using inputs.io at the moment. I'll look into coinbase, to see for myself.

Do you know who he is now? :p
