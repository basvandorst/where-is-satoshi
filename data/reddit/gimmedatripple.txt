So, like [Ripple?](

When we get into quantum computing, we might be able to devise a system wherein the status of all nodes in aggregate is self-evident to each individual node, but while we're stuck with the tech that we have, we can't create a truly distributed currency.

So their business plan is to take all the value that the Bitcoin gains and keep it for themselves, and reframe that as a feature... this is diabolical.

A truly distributed currency would be kind of like if everyone were distributing their own currency. You could think of it like Ripple without XRP, the gateways or Consensus. It's essentially a perfect credit-style system. You work, you gain credit, you spend your credit and meanwhile outstanding debts owed to you are instantaneously resolved through the most rational path in the network that clears the most outstanding debt. It would be a self-stabilizing system. You could have pseudonymous protections, but true anonymity may still elude. It's worth pointing out, we're probably looking at about 30-50 years from now.

where were you looking at this?

Too late to the party? Man, it's Tuesday. The party's on *Friday*.

It's a BitCoin conspiracy! 
... I hope bitcoinbillionaire is reading this so that he knows that I know, and also knows that if he know's what's good for him, he'll place 20 unmarked BitCoins in this account: a73e473f-6683-06b0-8d4a-4986a5cb485b to keep me quiet! &gt;:)
I vote most interesting currency in history.

This is really the key to Bitcoin's future that most people don't understand. 
Bitcoin isn't necessarily the most potent or pure implementation of a decentralized, anonymous crypto-currency. Certainly it has a number of master-stroke features, however a rational mind might ask what is stopping others from making a better currency? The answer is nothing. Depending on your position on economic theory, there are already a number of significantly better alternative crypto-currencies. The reason Bitcoin will persist is simply because it is the first big decentralized crypto-currency. It is historically significant now. The brand has been imbued with a certain intangible value, much like gold before it.

This is along the lines of what I was thinking. Open-source software to enable customized mult-factor storage on a computer LiveCD or USB and built-in support for an entire class of physical "lockboxes". The platform should be able to offer support for all sorts of security features to be built on. Keys, codes, RFID, biometrics, etc.

Maybe a good way to save your inheritance.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:07:00
Yea. What?
@_date: 2013-06-08 22:01:41
Well... then, shotty my idea. ;)
Seriously though, just make sure everything's very clear and good luck.

As I understand Ripple, XRP is certainly a currency. They say it's like a postage stamp in their messaging for educational and strategic purposes, to sidestep the 'funny money' maelstrom. Each transaction on Ripple propagates through the network in XRP, so if you have XRP you have a store of value that can be used in a transaction in place of whatever currency is required at the endpoint.
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:46:10
Turns out it is not true. I don't think this damages the argument for XRP's standing as a currency, just what I thought was a great characteristic to give it intrinsic value.

Fix the proof-of-work functions so that GPU &amp; CPU mining are both viable.
The reason this is important is to preserve the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Specialized mining hardware turns the hardware manufacturers into regulatory bottlenecks - weak points in the Bitcoin ecosystem for governments to target. It also puts the hashing power of the network into a smaller set of hands, leaving Bitcoin more vulnerable to a 51% attack. 
This probably means splitting the proof-of-work into several different computational operations.

The code should be open-source to allow the community to collaborate and eliminate vulnerabilities.

I don't mean to suggest that people should leave their money with someone else - I very much believe the idea of people holding their own money is powerful and transformative and should be preserved.
I'm suggesting that if someone makes a solution can take care of absolutely everything end-to-end in securing an individuals money, just like a bank, that, that person will be met by a very strong market demand.
