Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.

This is exactly my cash out plan. Pay off my mortgage and buy a scion frs or Subaru BRZ.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:19
This is my thought too. Has anyone looked where the btcs being sold are going? Is it all the a few new wallets?

How long would it take u to put that money back into crypto

No because bitcoin is a brand name now. People will hear mbtc and think btc has lost its value. It will be devesating to the price since it will turn a lot of prospective buyers away
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:58:23
Nah. It'll never be suddenly abandoned. That just doesn't make sense
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:08:53
Ya was thinking that too. Might as well keep it in btc making crazy interest while mortgage rates are so low

If you know which computer you saved your screenshot to and the file name or partial file name of the screen shot you can use a recovery software to look for your deleted files

Segwit2x and segwit are different things

if exodus supports them there should be an option to split them there. If it doesnt I believe splitting them gets a tonne more complicated.

I dont understand this. You want to buy bitcoin but dont want to use a bitcoin exchange? Theres localbitcoin but an online exchange is by far the easiest  way to buy btc. Why is buying btc going over your head?

its more the lack of sites that accept Canadian residences credit cards, not the banks blocking them.
