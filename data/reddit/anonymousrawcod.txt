While I certainly appreciate the response time regarding upgrading their OpenSSL version, what about any other steps taken? For example has a new certificate been issued and the old one revoked? Will users be told to change their passwords?
This vulnerability has existed for over 2 years and has been known about prior to the 7th of April (as made clear by their own blog entry where it says Cloudflare has applied a fix a week ago). Hoping for the best and that nothing bad has happened would be quite ignorant.

I'm in. Not much of a choice where to go though in the U.A.E. as only The Pizza Guys in Dubai accept BTC. I also checked with them if they still accept and they do. However apparently only the owner knows how to handle the payment and I have to give them a heads up the day before I plan to come so they can make sure the owner will be present (I feel special already).

I'm residing in the U.A.E. and have had no trouble with depositing from a European account to Bitstamp and later withdrawing into my account in the U.A.E. . I did have to use my real name (which already was verified) because the beneficiary's name has to be the same, third party withdrawals are not allowed.

I had no trouble when I submitted documents containing watermarks (and at a lousy JPEG quality). Maybe the person dealing with your application didn't know it was allowed.
