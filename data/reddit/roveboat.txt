Yeah, I'm sure changetip (of all things) is what the Greeks really need now, all they need is to post tons of BTC praise around Reddit and just wait for the tips to roll in. Then with all their tipped BTC they can just.. starve, I guess, as I doubt many Greek stores will be interested in taking BTC (as they need fiat too to buy more stuff for the store), regardless of their knowledge of changetip.
You're presenting BTC (and changetip) as somehow a magical solution to Greeces problems without seemingly any understanding of the situation *or* how BTC might even apply to it.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:18:43


Could you explain, exactly, how this would work? Is there going to be Greek cash police going around and having checkpoints where cash is being checked and exchanged?

The problem is that then you wouldn't be able to buy more supplies to make more gyros, as your supplier would not accept your BTC. What are you going to sell then to feed yourself?
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:22:58


Um, how, exactly, would this work? There just would be Greeks on Localbitcoins that would be super happy to trade their fiat cash (eg. the only form of money accepted when you need to buy food) to bitcoins, because .. why? You'd sell your BTC on Bitstamp and then.. what? How would you get your fiat into Greece? 
There needs to be a counterparty that's interested in doing that for it to work. In the current Greek situation, I doubt there would be many people interested in selling fiat for BTC.

Wait, the suppliers in Greece are selling for BTC? That's pretty awesome. Otherwise, you know, it would be just as hard to restock (fiat or BTC) but with BTC the seller has no idea when he can redeem that payment or how much fiat he will get for it (which he needs to restock). It just doesn't make sense, except from a speculation POV - which is pretty popular round these parts.

Okay. It's all about vision, got it. I'm happy to comfortably say that my vision indeed does not include BTC - while the blockchain is an interesting idea and might have some use in the future, BTC as it is will not be *the one*. (Why?

Yeah, because there is no other way to learn about money. Like, say, giving each other pieces of paper and metal which have perceived value.

Ehm. If the user can't keep their Windows machine malware-free, they certainly cannot be expected to be able to sandbox all applications they install. I'm not aware of any Linux distributions that would do that by default. 
Even if you abided by all of those rules, it would still only take one privilege-escalation exploit to bypass all of those. As an example, [this exploit]( affects basically *all* Linux systems that are running a kernel older than 3.8.10 which was released in April 2013. This means every install where the user/distro doesn't automatically update the kernel older than ~6 months is vulnerable. These exploits are getting a bit rare these days, but they do pop up every now and then.

vintermann already pointed out of the one major problems with floating point and financial math, but another thing about doubles (or floating point in general) is that IEEE standard floating point is *not deterministic* across compilers and platforms. That is, the same calculation can have different results on different machines. This probably doesn't affect the Mt Gox case that much, but could result in little rounding errors creeping in here and there, which will end up getting magnified as time goes on.

Well, we can always look at indicators that might tell us if the pot is boiling or not. For example, Bitstamp [volume]( has been under 50k for the last few weeks and has only touched 100k in the last few months. As far as I'm aware, bitstamp is by far the biggest exchange and even the fall of Gox doesn't really register on their volumes.
If Coinbase/Bitpay was exchanging thousands of bitcoins to dollars every day, surely it would need to show up somewhere? Or do they have *really* deep pockets? The reality is that the trading volume is trending down hard and that will be a problem.

I think you're vastly overestimating the cost - or the current hashrate.
Current hashrate is ~40 000 000 GH/s. One Avalon does ~80 GH/s. Thus, one would need ~500 000 Avalons to match the current hash rate. At $1500, this would mean ~$750M - and that's with old(ish) hardware that includes profit margins for the manufacturers.

You don't, basically, unless you can find a buyer. For example, the bitstamp order book is currently so shallow that selling 35k BTC would result in the price falling to 0.1.. Of course, if someone started liquidating that amount, it's possible that many bots/daytraders/etc started jumping in to buy and it wouldn't drop that far. How far is anyones guess, but as of right now the BTC market is still extremely small.

That's why the businesses selling for BTC use Bitpay etc that guarantee that they get fiat with the exchange rate that they sold for (as their suppliers don't take BTC so they need fiat anyway).

Then the question is; how long do you think people not yet invested in BTC will see it as such? Will that happen before or after BTC starts getting traction as something else than a speculative instrument? 
Because, if that traction takes a while - which it seems like it will - then you better have liquidated your holdings before the new suckers stop coming in as after that point, the only thing left is to see who ends up holding on to the hot potato.

It's a different attack. As far as I understand it (and I'm no expert!), essentially, if they discover the next block, they can choose not to publish it and start working on the next one. If someone else discovers it and they're still only one ahead, at least they have a headstart on the next block. If they discover the next block, they can announce the first one, putting everyone the next block while they are working on the one after it. Basically forcing everyone else unknowingly to work on blocks that are already discovered by the attacker in secret, wasting their work.

The basic technique you'd want to use for memorizing a private key is the [method of loci]( (or memory palace). 
Basically, split your key up to small groups - maybe 2 or 4 characters each. Then, picture in your mind a location that is very familiar to you - maybe your neighborhood or the house you've lived in for 10 years. Map a path through that location in your mind. Along the way, pick out 32 (or 16, if you're going by groups of 4) specific places where you will stop. At each of these stops, you will place a mental image that you connect to one of the small groups, in order.
As an example for remembering one such place, the group is 7B and the location is your mailbox. You could imagine for example the seven dwarves, being chased by bees running around your mailbox. The more outrageous/silly/raunchy these mental images are, the easier they will be to remember. 
After a small time of inventing and memorizing these, you'll be able to walk through that path in your head remembering those images and connecting them to letters.

I'm with you on this. Unless there are enough buyers to offset the supply of BTC through mining and BTC payment processors, the price will be inching downwards until the supply dries up. As the mining supply is constant, mining capacity taken offline (due to it not being profitable anymore) will not affect the supply, but if major miners decide to call it quits, it's gonna result in an interesting few weeks while waiting for the difficulty to readjust..

Most of them already are - exchanging them as fast as they can to fiat. I believe this is what is fueling the constant downwards trend in value that has been going on since January - or even the bubble peak, one could argue. I think this is part of the problem - people holding Bitcoins now are eager to spend them with merchants, but that only takes money out of the system and pushes the value downwards, as long as the amount spent is more than the amount mined + amount bought.

No, actually, it is. It *is* horrible as an example of a programming language, without even going into the library, runtimes or performance. 
As an example, PHP is one of the few (and probably the only major) languages that are [not transitive]( eg. if A == B  and B == C, A is not necessarily == to C. There are also quirks wherein A &lt; B, B &lt; C and C &lt; A which lead to all kinds of funky things in sorting for example.

I'm not sure if you're trolling, but hey, I have nothing better to do. 
A general purpose IC is like a Leatherman - it can do many things but it's not really that great at anything. ASIC is like a Japanese cooking knife. It's really awesome for cutting mean pieces of sushi, but pretty much useless when you need to open your computer case. That difference for a very specific task - the overhead - will always be there, it's *always* possible to design a tool to do it better than a Leatherman.
Complexity (I'm not even sure what you mean by that?) might seem like a solution, but it really is not. It probably would make the difference bigger in reality, as the GPU is already pretty damn good at number crunching (see: CPU-GPU mining differences) but not that great with complexity. Memory bound algorithms have been suggested (Litecoin uses one - because *GPU mining* was seen as too much and they wanted to encourage CPU mining - didn't work in the end, though..), but even then, when ASICs enter the picture, they would most likely smoke whatever your CPU/GPU and it's limited standardised memory and bus could do.

Hmm - 50kh/s sounded so low that I had to [check]( and it seems like you're (or the wiki is..) off by a few magnitudes there - A Pentium III is listed as 0.39Mh/s = 390kh/s. A fair assumption would be something like 3Mh/s/CPU, meaning a 1000 of them would result in 3Gh/s =~ $0.02/day. 
However, it does still seem way too low to make a living even in a cheaper part of the world and a 10000-strong botnet doing the work for you. One would need at least 100k compromised servers to make it at all feasible with the current difficulty.

They could be produced in exactly the same manner. 2 million chips (I think Avalon was 8 chips / device - not sure about that, though) is a small order on the scale that chip fabs work on.


Where is all that hashing going towards if it doesn't contribute towards the total hashrate?


500? Come on. Swapping out boards when they fail does not require 1 person / 500 boards. Big datacenters run at night with one person monitoring thousands of servers and this would be a way simpler proposition.


Which is much less than 'billions' that you originally asserted.


At that point the hypothetical NSA project would already have everything in place to increase capacity very easily. Chips, in themselves, are not that expensive. What made Avalon cost $1500 was a) design b) small run and c) profit margins. These would not be issues if a sovereign state decided to enter the game.


No, costs are a minor part of it, really, for a sovereign actor to get invovled. The motivation - like you say - is a much murkier subject.

The timespan=1hrs chart is exactly the same as timespand=4days and lists Ghash.IO having 232 blocks while the last 24 hours lists them as having 79 blocks, so I'm thinking 4 days is the default and they only generate the three different datasets that are linked. 
Either way, looking at the last 1 hour and making conclusions from that doesn't make too much sense, as the average rate of block discovery is kept at ~10minutes by difficulty, so 1 hour would only include ~6 blocks. Randomness is way too high at that point to analyze it properly.

If the cost of the mining - as small as it is - is zero, then yes, he is benefiting. I'd imagine operations like this find, attack and infect their targets automatically. Thus, the actual operator might have tens of thousands of servers running cpuminer which starts adding up..

~~Wait, how do you figure 0.3w/Gh/s is a *generous* estimate when you only list one device that actually beats it and one that doesn't beat it but beats everything else available?~~ Note that this is an *extremely* generous estimate - older chips were obviously much worse in this regard and almost as obviously, most of the network is still comprised of those older chips. I doubt most Chinese operators are busy replacing their chips..
For example, the Avalon1 - which I'm *hoping* isn't running anywhere anymore but most likely sold a metric shitton - used a whopping [**6.6W/Gh/s**]( and that's only from the chip, not even accounting for losses outside the chip (that you, nor the article, even consider). I think it's possible that your 0.3w/Gh/s estimate could even be a whole magnitude off, which would mean that the network would consume 100 times the whole block of BoA..
Thanks for actually calculating the rest of it, though!

Even if I agree that it's probably impossible for the powers to be to shut Bitcoin completely down, I think it's a bit silly to think that they couldn't make it so hard/dangerous to use that the network would be basically capped to what it was in 2010 or so - handful of users and real world value of fractions of cents/BTC. This would, of course, require quite tough legislation, internet control etc but definitely feasible for, say, China to do in a very short span of time.

Sounds like a huge guesstimate - the miners themselves are probably quite a varied group, with electricity costs and efficiencies all over the board, so it's probably impossible to give one figure and even if you could, it probably wouldn't be nice and even like $200. 
Obviously, if the price keeps slipping, that point *will* come when the big players start turning off their miners and we'll see it pretty much instantly in hashrate at that point.

Or spend $10m upfront and buy/license what Avalon has and then throw couple of million to manufacturing. Done within a month or two.
As for botnets, I don't think you understand how much more efficient ASICs are than CPUs or even GPUs. I have no idea what the going prices for botnets are like, but I'd imagine you could only run CPU miners on those as real mining GPUs are quite rare and would be found out pretty quickly, I'd imagine, due to them being in high-end gaming PCs and thus seeing use.. But, just for the sake of argument let's assume the botnet has all high-end CPUs in them and also that the whole botnet would be on 24/7 and noone would notice the 'slight' slowness of their computers mining with 100% CPU time.
The highest single CPU [listed]( is i7 3930k at 66.6Mh/s, so to reach that 150000Gh/s one would need a botnet with about 2.2 million CPUs. I'm pretty sure getting a botnet like that would be quite a bit more than 500k.. A single Avalon @ 60Gh/s (=60000Mh/s) is comparable to just under 1000 such CPUs.

Avalon *sells* the chips in bulk in numbers far greater than 2500.

I'd imagine the problem is finding someone to do so *small* runs for decent prices, as the big boys don't really do runs in the thousands.. 
Who, exactly, would notice it and how? Also, what would it matter even if someone noticed? It's not like they can be banned from the network even if they announced it publicly.

Sorry man, you're in over your head and redefining words as you go which is pretty bad form when in an argument. Designing is not programming, as it's crucial for computers to be able to reprogrammed and you cannot do that to an ASIC.
The key difference here is that a supercomputer *can* calculate SHA-256 hashes (slower than the Bitcoin network), but the Bitcoin network cannot, for example, simulate nuclear explosions at all because it's not Turing-complete and thus is *not* a computer. It's more like the fastest calculator in the world than the fastest supercomputer.

But.. Is it? It's actually pretty hard to say whether it's a commodity or a currency right now and to be honest, the more value it has the more of a commodity it becomes.

Not really, we can just look at the current network and the currently available ASICs. Current network hashrate - which also includes a sizable amount of ASICs - is around 150000Gh/s. An Avalon mines around 60Gh/s. Thus, to get over half of the current network (eg. match it), one would need about 150000/60 = 2500 Avalons. If, say, Citigroup (2012 Revenue [$60B]( decided to get in on it, the network would be roflstomped to the ground *very* quickly. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 22:25:20
I think he's underestimating the amount of hashing power needed to reach that 200M - 1333.333TH/s total speed results in a difficulty target of 200M - and not really understanding what exponential growth actually requires.
I'm not sure if Avalon Batch 3, Bitfury and ASICMiner (I doubt KnC can reach it, if they ever even ship) total ~1PH/s more online by the end of October (certainly not by the beginning of it!) but it's certainly within reason.

This has happened in actual stock exchanges during times of great uncertainty as well. Not that Mt. Gox shouldn't have prepared better, but just saying.
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:02:37
However, most likely *not* safe from the world's security agencies. Just as a quick idea of how unsafe it actually is, the current network hashrate is a little under ~100Th/s. Considering the Avalon can do ~66Gh/s, one would need a bit over 1500 Avalons to grab over 50% of the network. If buying Avalons, the cost of this would be just under $2M, and it wouldd be nuts to think that the NSA/MSS/FSB/etc wouldn't be able to throw that kind of money around *or* get their own ASICs designed and produced. 
We're still far from Bitcoin being 'safe' if the right people decide to fuck with it, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone soon did make that decision.

Mind you, these systems were designed by professionals and not amateurs like at Mt. Gox (no offense, but..) but still failed as the volumes went far higher than expected. Actual stock exchanges also have other kinds of safeguards to prevent things like this happening, such as shutting down trading completely if there is too much of volatility over the whole board.

Wait what - not what [I see]( from GB.

No liquidity eg. no one trading.

Which means it's about the time when it starts to get interesting. If SR goes down, what will be left to generate the demand for Bitcoins and run the Bitcoin economy?

Ugh! Yeah, it's definitely the worst part but I'm not sure MySql is that far behind. Although, haven't looked that way in years so I guess it might be better these days. To be honest, I'd be surprised to hear that it could do sharding and stay ACID which should be pretty much the  priority for an application like Mt Gox..

CampBX had a volume less than 1500 BTC in the last 24 hours. Looking at the [current market depth there]( it would take all of 120 BTC to drop the price there to $100, 641 BTC to drop it to $80, and 1409 BTC to drop it to $50. To fulfill all the current buy orders, one would need 3143 BTC. So no, it's not stable, it's just very quiet.

Well put. Getting rid of HFT and other similar bullshit would also be a bonus. Maybe it would even make Wall Street not so lucrative as a career, so the best and the brightest wouldn't end up gambling against each other on other peoples dime but rather concentrate on things that actually might do good for all of us?

Volume actually looks to be down, but recovered a bit after the very quiet times after the latest crash. [Since the peak]( (eg. last 6 months), volumes are way down. (note, volumes in currency eg USD)

HTML, yeah sure if and when all interested parties manage to agree what the spec actually is but TCP and HTTP? 
Not really. We're still using HTTP/1.1 - from 1999 - that basically added nothing else besides persistent connections to HTTP/1.0 from 1996. The protocol could use *a lot* of work - there's plenty of (mostly) unused cruft and only due to it's flexibility (basically free-form headers) we've been able to extend and work around it. I guess you could argue that this is what you meant by adapting to coming challenges, but change it definitely is not.
TCP I'm not so familiar with but my understanding is that there hasn't been many changes in the last decade or so. Feel free to correct me, though.

Sort of wrong, yeah. The difficulty get's adjusted every 2016 blocks so that the average time per block since the last difficulty adjustment would result in 10 minutes between blocks. Thus, if hashing power growth stopped exactly now, in a week and a half (2016 is calculated so that 10minutes/block = 2 weeks) the difficulty would set to whatever it should be so that the time between block would be 10 minutes. However, as it's likely that the hashing power will keep on growing (exponentially), by the time the next difficulty increase rolls around, blocks will still probably be generated in way less than 10 minutes.

Would you consider gold a currency then as well? A lot of people do use it for payments as well - way more than people use Bitcoin. Things as varied as jeans, stockings, caviar and bullets have been recently used as payments, so are they also all currencies?

[Ahem]( Sure, the interface and browser aren't quite at iPhone levels, but it was 2004 after all. Steve brought his ego and marketing machine and won.

I'm not sure many BOINC projects require hashing SHA-256, which is basically all this network can do.
