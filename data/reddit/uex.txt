I've been checking  but I couldn't find anything related to the design and I think the interface has plenty of room for improvement. 
Please don't misunderstand me, the app has many great features but it gives the chills to anyone without technical knowledge about the bitcoin protocol or basic cryptography.
This IMHO this is something all the wallets need to overcome if we really want bitcoin to spread beyond the early adopters stage. 
Im pretty sure sooner or later we will see some wallets evolve and adapt their interfaces and behaviour to novices, and those will get the biggest chunk of user share eventually.

Last week I got a VPS to run my own bitcoind node. After more than one day syncing is now up and running smoothly.  I paid 50,000 bits (19$/15€) for 1 year of service. This is [the offer I took](

I might just go and sneak in. It's worth a try...

It would be great if this movie and others funded with bitcoins could have an standard animated intro like a production company  Then you will be advertising the currency and perhaps will get donations for that

I agree! they damage the image of that [beautiful city](

ok, but as I understand I can't fork your project and put it on the market, even if I do it without profit. Isn't that right?

Did you achieve ROI? Are you considering the different scenarios based on the future plausible values of the currency in the market?
