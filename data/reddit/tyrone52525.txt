I know I shouldn't feed the trolls since you are clearly trolling and not even trying to understand, but here you are:
1.  Your assumption that Bitcoin would immediately die is erroneous.  An attempted 51% attack has limited ramifications.
2.  Any attacker with that much resources would choose a different (and more effective) attack vector.
3.  Destroying the current iteration of the Bitcoin network is just starting a game of whack-a-mole...  From a government's standpoint, Bitcoin is not nearly as dangerous as other, newer coins that focus more on anonymity.
4.  If you fear the government, then they could choose any other number of ways to stop bitcoin.
5.  A bunch of miners joining the same pool is MUCH DIFFERENT than a single entity controlling enough hardware to execute a 51% attack.  Profit-seeking Miners have everything to lose and nothing to gain from attacking the network.

It does increase the velocity of bitcoins, but widerspread use will likely drive increased user adoption.  More user adoption will lead to higher prices.

Fear?  What am I afraid of?
51% attacks have been considered for YEARS.  Its not someone raising a new perspective.  I pointed you towards a developer's thoughts on the issues and you can't be bothered to google 2 words.  You don't act like a person who is trying to consider new points.  You are just keep repeating your points without considering other issues.  
1.  Bitcoin has many vulnerabilities
2.  51% attack is not is vulnerability
3.  Even if a pool has 51% or more of hash power, I don't need to trust them at all as a holder of bitcoins.  They can never, ever spend my coins.  They can only cause problems for the network, which can be countered and mitigated.
Whether the person has 1000s of coins or not is irrelevant.  They have enough hardware to control 51% of the network.  Just that alone makes them heavily financially invested in bitcoin.  In theory the entity may not care about finance at all, but if that is the case, they should choose another attack vector.  
Again, Ghash's hash power is not the same as one entity controlling all the hardware.  The pool would be quickly abandoned by miners if a double spend was attempted. Ghash gaining 50% or more of the hash rate, doesn't mean an entity is preparing / attempting a 51% attack.  It would take a seriously concerted effort, very difficult in a pool environment.

Appreciate your view, but honestly you haven't thought enough about these issues and don't understand Bitcoin enough.
People way overestimate the value of pulling off a 51% attack or what the attacker could really do.  It is really NOT in the self-interest of an entity controlling 51% of the hashing power to destroy bitcoin for the future.  The only reason would be if the miners' sole motivation was to destroy bitcoin as a currency.  (There are some extreme corner cases as well, but this is the most realistic one).
Also the community / developers have a number of ways to counter a 51% attack.  See Gavin's post regarding the issue.

Did you read Gavin's post?
