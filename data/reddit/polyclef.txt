That is hardly the only case in which 0 confirmation fails. Here's another where block size makes no difference:
The various pools and miners have differing rules for which transactions they will mine. If you make a transaction that spends to a merchant and sends change to eg satoshidice, and double spend to just yourself, you can see similar effects depending on who mines the next block even if the blocks are 8mb or larger. 
This is like someone who walks through a minefield daily for a month despite the warnings of everyone who sees them. They just happen to be lucky and pass unscathed. On the 32nd day they traipse through the minefield and blow off their left leg and start complaining about how it was someone else's fault.  After all it was clearly safe since they did it for 31 days without incident.

The world jumped into bitcoin before even its strongest proponents expected they would.  As as result, we're having growing pains.  Bitcoin will see use as a day to day currency again as soon as lightning gains traction.  The first main net transactions have been made ( between the three independently developed clients.

@_date: 2017-12-10 20:54:33
I wish I knew for sure. There are many things that should bring the fees down. If large volume businesses implemented segwit, that would help a lot, but it seems that the ones that just pass the fee onto their customers don’t care. (Looking at you coinbase and bitpay).  Many of the wallets are not doing a good job of fee estimation and are just overpaying, driving up costs for everyone.  Lightning is highly anticipated, so uptake should be rapid, but it probably won’t have an effect within the next 30 days, but if you set up a lightning wallet, you could have inexpensive transactions with anyone else who does the same as soon as the client switches to main net (from testnet).  That will be very soon as I understand it (days, not weeks).

I am all for proper anarchism. The ideal is pretty hard to obtain before we have a real post-scarcity economy though.  
In the mean time, there are too many incentives to twist any political structure to the advantage of one group or another, leading eventually into dystopia.  
The moment that any faction has an edge, they tend to find a way to expand it until the imbalance becomes so acute that the people on the other side accept the cost of bloodshed and either reverse the dynamic or bring it back to neutral.  The latter gives people a chance at prosperity again.
Government eventually enables the worst crimes of humanity, but initially serves to slow down the cycle.  Around the world, most nations have are discovering that the costs dwarf the remaining benefits.
If we just eliminated the government all at once, but did nothing about the economic elites, inequality would get worse.  You'd see something like Russia if not a full devolution to warlords running competing factions.

That's nice, but the point is that he should have done so instead of throwing a tantrum and threatening to fork the client. Gavin knows this,  was his in Oct 2011 so he clearly can do it.

I agree that without the official blessing of the state that moderate wealth is effectively useless, but not the levels of wealth that the 85 people we are talking about command.
This is a contingency some of them have been planning for. I imagine that Gates and co have looked at the possible outcomes and decided to embark on the work that they have because of rational self interest.
Others have probably convinced themselves that either the time is still far off, or that they will be able to make enough before the collapse to justify massive losses. Hell, some probably think they won't survive without the extreme wealth they are amassing and view it as self preservation.
But the point is that they can buy islands and defensible mountaintop fortresses that will let them and their staff continue to live undiminished lifestyles for a few years at least. Possibly a decade or two if they are clever and have hidden well. It is worth noting that the ones giving their wealth away seem to have positive relationships with their children. The others, not so much.

The controversy is not over increasing the block size. It is over how that debate has been approached. Gavin skipped the standard BIP process which has been used for all substantive changes for the past several years. He instead announced a hostile code fork. He has done nothing but show a lack of foresight and care for the ecosystem thus far. His original 20mb proposal was based on his erroneous math (which he has admitted) but only changed after the Chinese exchanges insisted on 8mb.

The advantages that we get from having parents and teachers who pay attention accrue in ways most don't appreciate. Common sense is mostly an unremembered slow absorption of facts and experiences that lead to sharper intuitions and ability to extrapolate. When children don't get this it is possible for them to build it on their own, but it is at a later age and is a constant disadvantage to them. The numbers are clear, (will cite upon request) that social mobility and meritocracy you reference isn't true in the USA anymore. Even the dumbest 1%er will most likely die rich and the smartest children from the bottom will never have a chance to fulfill their potential. That is the part that should make everyone angry.

1. the issue isn't whether to increase the blocksize. it is that Gavin has decided that getting the blocksize increase has to happen on his schedule, despite being only peripherally involved with the developer community lately. He chose to bypass the existing process and make all sorts of public statements that have already hurt bitcoin. are his loudest supporters just speculators who got caught in a short position and are praying for a big enough mess to save their asses?

That level of inequality is unsustainable.  The smarter members of that group are actively redistributing their own wealth in ways that they believe work best.  The others ought to get started.
If not, at some point soon, people will look at that fact as inspiration to redistribute the wealth of those 85 on their terms instead.  I mean really, 41,176,470:1 those are pretty good odds, especially when there's so little to lose.
Even if they all live on $0.10USD/day, 10% of the aggregate daily earnings could equip 411 operations a day each with a budget of 100k targeting either direct theft, damage to infrastructure needed by businesses owned by the 85 or the 85 and their families directly. Even if you presume extensive defenses, they won't last, someone will take a bribe.
Redistribution is ugly, it's just a matter of how ugly.  I'd rather pay a little in taxes than wind up on the wrong end of a pitchfork.

If no one is actually running it, it might not be as easy to install as you believe.  If no one is getting paid, then it makes sense that they're not donating back.  But if they're making buckets of BTC, change your pricing model and start charging instead of hoping for donations.

the peg can be independent of the sidechain.  eg, you have 10 parties who want to do something on a sidechain. you could have a  7/10 multisig composed of the depositors. That way the sidechain operator doesn't have actual control of the funds.  If the sidechain does anything odd, the multisig just returns balances reflected in the last known good ledger state or as the parties agree.
Ideally the multisig is code agreed to by the participants and the above can be specified as part of the setup, but it could be people too (eg poker tournament sidechain with a 2/3 officiator multisig).

Translation: not a script kiddie. 
This term is such a cop out. Since the beginning, there were anklebiters who lacked the skill to be serious threats and were only able to break into the occasional site when their toolkit aligned with a vulnerability on a system.  
There have always been more patient attackers who were willing to devote their attention to one particular target and work their way in.  This doesn't even require that they have the skills to discover new vulnerabilities and write exploit code.  Just the ability to keep probing for openings and using them to get one step closer.

Until then learn and contribute code instead of FUD.

Says $0.04/tx is current average fee.  It only got up to $0.10 during the stress test.  When supply was constrained. 
Tell me again how increasing the supply is going to bring in a ton of fee revenue?

Put it this way, either you are one of the 14 people who increased their wealth by $157 billion over the past two years, you're a chump.
If you are and have nothing better to do than troll reddit, you're a complete waste of carbon.

Full nodes do full verification.  The alternative is called SPV (Simplified Payment Verification). 
Miners don't always run full nodes.  This is a hazard that caused a minor fork recently.

The lead developer is funded by MIT and is totally independent. Why is it that he isn't in favor either?

Yes. There are security tradeoffs from moving from 1mb to 8mb. Clear enough for you?

You ask about products, but follow up with a comment expressing concern about what core developers are spending their time doing.
Blockstream was founded by bitcoin developers ( who had been writing code used throughout the ecosystem in their discretionary time and who believed they could advance the space more effectively if they were able to focus full time on bitcoin as part of a larger team instead of continuing to split their energies between their day jobs, family and other commitments. Do you believe that they contribute less now that they are at Blockstream than they did when they had another non-bitcoin company as an employer?
Since bitcoin is open source, some obvious metrics can be examined, such as pull requests (code or documentation changes):
 author%3Asipa created%3A&gt;2014-10-01
Code review is obviously extremely important in a financial system, so also look at comments/etc on proposed pull requests:
 involves%3Asipa created%3A&gt;2014-10-01
Another major area of contribution is submission, investigation or other assistance with bug reports:
repeat for TheBlueMatt, gmaxwell, jtimon, luke-jr, pstratem, instagibbs, wtogami, maaku, rustyrussell and all of the other employees who's github usernames I don't recall off the top of my head.
That's just the surface too. Look at  which several companies are basing commercial offerings on. The scaling bitcoin conferences. The efforts to educate incoming potential developers on irc, not to mention responding to random questions such as this.
There was no shortage of interested investors in either the seed or series A rounds. Reid Hoffman discussed his reasons for investing here: 
That’s why it’s so important to promote development efforts that increase the power and flexibility of Bitcoin Core, and to do so in a way that keeps Bitcoin open, accessible to all users and developers, a public good. In pursuit of this public good, I have personally invested in a start-up called Blockstream.
If you can't see anything that has been produced, you aren't looking very hard at all.

Chargebacks up to 6 months later are another feature of credit cards that merchants have to deal with. In essence, instead of 6 blocks (~60 mins), you wait 6 months to be sure your money won't disappear on you.

No hard fork needed, just a malleability fix and a soft fork.

Of course! While I can't speak for anyone else, I personally think those are two people who deserve our support. 
This is why I have been concerned about centralization and approaches that cause there to be fewer miners and less full nodes. If that trend isn't reversed then censorship is easier and the promise of bitcoin is lost.  All that you have left is a really inefficient database.
Did you see the confidential transactions work we released?

This is why just changing the block size is just spinal tap scaling ("it goes to 11!"). It's overly simplistic and distracts from other approaches that provide much greater capacity increases (lightning, sidechains).
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:44:48
That isn't what is being said at all. First off, I am in favor of increasing the block size (not the XT fork or bip 101 however).
To use your analogy, there is a limited budget and not all upgrades can be done at the same time. Some things cost more than others, some provide more performance than others. It's tradeoffs.

Not that good..
Note the 12 BTC input-&gt;11 BTC output, stands out like a sore thumb, no?
Also, the 3x1.43 inputs are probably part of a ~4.29 input or payment.
Unless there is full uniformity of input and outputs, this is a waste of time.

You might not want to do that.  It looks like the key is reasonably unique per device, but that it has limited entropy for multiple key generation.  The referenced paper ( is about fingerprinting devices based on slight manufacturing differences.  It seems not unlikely that reuse of the same device could expose you to attack by anyone with access to the device due to that fingerprint giving a distinct skew to generated values.

Umm, no. Making ones self a fugitive by defrauding a government via tax credits for a nonexistent supercomputer is not something that someone with a billion dollars of Bitcoin would do.

Where did you get that idea? The *point* of this is to protect the Bitcoin ecosystem in the case that the company does fail. It makes snagging the patents in a fire sale and using them for evil a non-starter.

I just checked and it appears that by default, API access is disabled.  
There are a couple things listed on the integrations page.  There's third party applications (oddly, the coinbase android app is listed here) and then there's the API Key.
The first section is the apps you've authorized to use the OAuth2 authentication interface.  OAuth2 allows more granular controls than the API key.
API key authentication is unrestricted (and the docs advise as much).  Since it's allowed to be passed as a query param, the key has probably made it's debut in web server logs under referer url.
eg from 
Do you know if any affected accounts had any third party applications authorized?
