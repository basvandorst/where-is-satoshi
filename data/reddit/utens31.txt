The efficency of Ac vs ineficency of direct current.
And efficency of Bitcoin vs costs and long waiting times for bank transfers ecc

In the 900s , there was the war of the currents, there are links on the note.
it's clearler if u google, Direct current was losing since is more waistfull and less efficient. And to discredit the alternate current they organized events where they used to kill big animals with it  to show  to the public the potential risk of  alternate current ( the one we  use in all over the world)
