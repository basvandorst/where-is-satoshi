just checked out cryobit after reading this post and it is by far the sleekest looking cold storage 'wallet' i've seen... umm how do i get a wallet address and encrypted passphrase? and can you store unlimited amounts of different coins on it?

ya pissing me off... mine was showing 50% of the 15min graph earlier today and now its literally only two candles. ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:19:39
ugh jealous. u fancy :) lucky you
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:18:04
pump before the short? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:31
it is insanely bullish right now, i'm not even sure who still has the money to drive the price up so high, considering how expensive BTC is at the moment. Well besides the whales and their plans to short... which supports your thoughts on how bitcoin will inevitably correct
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:09
you can also send BTC directly to darknet markets and they will shut down your account 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:02:40
what is the centralised mining?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:56:24
lol my first trade on gdax got me $3 as well after fees
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:12:31
that's what i thought.. ive got some buy orders for 11500-12500 but we will see
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:25
do you day trade based on volume ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:09:00
nobody cares about your lost opportunity 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:40:26
this is funny
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:21
whales pump it high now. futures become available... they use huge leverages and short massively. bitcoin crashes , whale wins
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:04:30
a lot of people are against this idea but honestly i very much so see it being a possibility
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:59:58
hey i called my credit card company and they got it approved for me.. they thought it was fraudulent even though i had made the same kind of purchase before. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:43:01
Isn't it weird that two different banks would both decline the purchases?
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:39:08
thankss. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:13:31

dream market 2015
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:45
given this would it be more beneficial to an investor with millions of dollars to pump btc now and then short it on a futures market? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:54:14
oh nice simple explanation , thanks
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:34:25
am i understanding this correctly.. you have a Roth that is pegged against a Bitcoin Index? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:57:09
commenting to learn as well :p
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:54:55

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:51:02

@_date: 2018-02-12 16:04:47
how on earth do you predict this
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:39:44
lol right all these posts and im just thinking, dead cats bounce 
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:43:18
or not
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:08:16

@_date: 2018-02-12 17:43:20
