Looks like 10 is bottom

lol... When the fuck did I ask for evidence for that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:57:26
That isn't a legal precedent.
Its just a piece of paper with dead peoples signatures on it.
Its only "legal" because of circular logic.
Your move.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:13:35
I asked you to state your case, you refuse.
That's the discussion we had.
I dont have time to watch mental gymnastics all day.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:57
How about this?
A man appears and offers you an option of a single bottle water and a 100 BTC.
Which do you choose?
Now, you are starving and dying in the desert, the man appears and offers you 100BTC or water, which do you choose?
I think you will find that all value is subjective, even if some cases the utility weighs its value down more.

Threats and punishment don't necessarily equal morality or rightful/legitimate action. In fact, its typically the opposite.

Which basic econ is that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:12
Do you want to move the goal posts again?
I am not assuming any premises.
I'm simply rejecting your claims because you cannot provide evidence for them.
I have literally taken no position here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:31:47


Yeah, and taxes are real theft, so...
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:12:11
yes... get some ETH
Do it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:09:32
Im not sure if I would agree here.
Sure, in the short term it may seem like a decent idea to break even, but it was invested for a reason.
By pulling 10% you are losing 10% of value over time. 
IE, you pull $1,000 out today, in months or years, that $1,000 could have been a million dollar mistake.
I would seriously consider holding it if you can afford to.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:40
What if I made the claim that we have always existed within a state of anarchism, and the most powerful have conquered.
This is true if we logically consider a few things.
There was no pre-existing legal structure for law. No one had a legitimate legal basis to create any form of law. It was simply the most powerful groups that arose (from anarchism) to create these rules.
The law itself does not stand on any firm legal basis. it is true circular logic. The law is legitimate because the law says it is.
You have 2 options.
You can accept it, or you can reject being ruled by them
Its your choice, but we will always exist in a state of actual anarchy.
If you're going to make the claim that because there are rules, it is not anarchism, take a good look at Somalia. There are plenty of rules, many of which, punishable by death.

A) you don't get to steal from me, offer a highly overpriced service that I didn't even ask for in return, and claim its legitimate
B) cryptos aren't backed by fiat. the only one that is, is Tether.

I am liking Binance so far.
They have their own coin (BNB)
using BNB to pay your fees cuts them in half.
This is also good for the coin, because the more people are using them for fees, the value goes up.
They are also burning 50% of them over time. 
It seems to be a pretty neat feature for an exchange.

You could sell your used land, but new land is worth a substantial amount more.

Not sure if youre trying to make the claim that government fiat is capitalism...
Its not.

interesting,

I dropped cable because I didn't want it.
There are many market alternatives these days to cable companies these days.
The same is happening to the internet, and the companies know it.
They are losing their monopolies backed by running cables, as we are moving towards a more and more likely wireless future.
Also, 
Speaking of cable, it is FCC regulated.
Why would you use a failure of regulation as an example of why we need it?

Extra pickles please.

If its binding, it is law.
If it is law, it must be legitimate.
If its legitimate, it must have an existing legal basis to stand upon
It has no legal basis, except for its own claims.
It is, most certainly, circular logic.


I am not sure if you are aware, but those who signed and agreed to this contract are dead.
Like, really really dead.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:48:17
well, it seems you may be right actually.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:54:54
ummm... ok then.
Do whatever you wanna do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:25:13
Prove your argument or i have no choice but to reject it.

Keep the fallacies coming.
I'm certain it will do wonders for your argument.

We've got people putting their entire live saving into crypto and they think ~~its okay for their portfolio to swing 50% negative and~~ thats perfectly healthy and normal.

Maybe he lost .66 BTC trying to day trade?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:28:19
You don't.
you just ride it out and pull some profits on the way.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:14:30
Gdax certainly has fees for withdrawing BTC...
It has no fees for transfers between GDAX and CB... that's not exactly a withdrawal.
However, if you're trying to move your conis to another exchange, in most cases, its probably best to convert your BTC into ETH first.
Once you are on your new exchange, you can convert them back to BTC if you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:23:58
U wot?
Are you also going to ask us if you should buy when it goes back up to 20K?
The answer is yes.
I will take your money if youre just giving it away.

You do realize that Somalia is the result of a failed socialist government, right?
I will never understand why governance failures are continually blamed on anarchists..
Absolute garbage logic.

Cant afford what price?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:44:05
my favorite part of capitalism is when people raise their prices so no one can afford their product.
Its one of the most effective business models the world has ever seen.
I'm being sarcastic of course.
This literally doesn't happen.
Unless ofcourse, going bankrupt is your endgame.

I'm liking Binance so far.
A few tips...
Buy a few BNB immediately and use it to pay all your fees.
This will keep you from accumulating crypto dust.
It will also reduce your fees by 50%
BNB is the exchanges own coin. which means that when it grows, your account can grow. The more people who use it for tx or for liquidation, can cause the coins value to rise.
If it grows faster than your fees charged, you can essentially have little to no tx fees.
Im not going to spam my referral link here, but if you want it, I can PM it to you.
You get nothing out of the link, I would just get half of your tx fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:26
I don't think it will get down to 7k, not that I would complain.
That would be a decent entry point for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:49:27
this isnt about what the constitution says.
this is about whether or not it is legitimate and binding.
It is legitimate and binding in the same way rape or armed robbery is.
You either comply, or bad things will happen to you.
Force doesn't make things legitimate.
.. and you speak of ethics
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:15
no, I simply reject that they do have legitimacy, because there is no evidence to suggest they do.
This isn't a position on any matter, its a failure of the burden of proof. I rejected a claim, I didnt make one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:38:16
you're damn right I would.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:34:47
That's why I am buying all of the IOTA I can get my hands on....

Didn't he dump all his BTC for Bcash just hours before the addition to CB.
It sounds awfully convenient.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:33:47
Do you think bitcoin will still be mined in 100 years?
yes, it will be mined until 2140 I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:49:45
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:54
You still have yet to prove any existing legal foundation.

You can also choose not to buy at a parabolic rise and completely relieve all of that risk just by not being stupid..
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:08:46
And is it a problem to call them out on letting emotions lead them into FOMO?
I don't think it is...
You gave a perfect example of FOMO...
Why do you think literally everyone advises against it.
It's not like it's a secret.
I have no problem calling someone dumb money for doing exactly what everyone advises against..
@_date: 2019-03-19 15:21:07
uh... what?
And yea..
You would have to be retarded to buy at 19k during the last run..
It made literally no rational sense to buy after a going hyperbolic like that. You do whatever you want.. but you will just get burned like everyone who made that mistake and fomo'd.
Buy during periods of accumulation.. like right now..
not during the euphoria phase of a market cycle.
And yes.. make that note to self..
I think you might need it.
Next accumulation phase might be over 19k aftera future bullrun...
So while your note isn't exactly what I said.. if it helps, do it.
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:34:03
Pushing ATH in a bullish pattern is fine. This happens all the time.
Fomo'ing in at a new ATH after a parabolic rise with literally zero TA backing up the decision is universally a bad move..
I'm not sure how to be more clear here..
Zero charts showed a good buy anywhere near 20k
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:06:36
I mean,
Is it really that high risk?
Historically, you have only needed to hold it for atleast a year and you were basically guaranteed gains unless you were a dumbass and fomo'd in at ATH..
Its only risky if you throw money at it blindly.
Anyone who has picked up during any accumulation cycle has historically remained exceptionally profitable the years following.
