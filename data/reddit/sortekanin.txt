I don't really think that's the problem. The current problem is that bitcoin doesn't have any actual value, because it's unusable as a currency. If just the transaction fees were lowered, it would be easier to use as a currency, more wares would be purchasable with bitcoin and the price would stabilize since the wares have inherent value.

Nobody knows anything.

Some maybe changed in panic when price started dropping. Maybe they thought it was gonna drop all the way.

True, but you can't really "stop" cryptocurrencies unless you literally start censoring the internet and such.

Fees are to incentivize miners to put your transaction in the next block on the chain. This is due to the block size being limited, which means there's a lot of competition for spaces -&gt; high transaction fee. There have been many proposals to lower the fees, one being hard forks like bitcoin cash, other being something like the lightning network. As it stands though, you are right, bitcoin is hardly usable as a medium of exchange.

What is the deal with ripple? How is it different from bitcoin?

It's not knowledge, it's speculation. If you think you have some knowledge about whether the price is gonna rise or fall you're either magically clairvoyant or fooling yourself.
Also how was I being a douchebag? I think the best advice to give to newbies is that nobody actually knows more than they do - ie do your own research and don't just follow the advice of some random redditor.

Hm, I guess Bitstamp is more european friendly.

As more miners will stop because it won't be profitable for them, they will make it more profitable for all the other miners. At some point it balances out and the remaining miners will earn roughly the same as before.

Emojis are also just part of unicode :P

This is actually a good point. If they all fall, that's not such a huge worry since it's not like crypto-currencies are going away any time soon and they are likely to get back to their original relative values eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:24:24
Just go over to Bitstamp, they use it.

Which hopefully would be fixed if more people took bitcoins as payment, since bitcoin's value would then be sort of based on the products' value.

But the original commenter didn't ask about information about the coin, just about the price. I don't think my comment is useless as it emphasises that nobody actually knows what's going to happen with the price - the question implies that the original commenter thought someone might know.

Definitely. Also always have an emergency fund that has 0 risk. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:09:38
Ah come on. I read your comment in a jokingly fashion, I didn't take it badly. Besides, you were totally correct.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:57:31
Well... I guess nothing truly has 0 risk... but barring post-apocalyptic conditions or a global financial crash, I'd say cash under your mattress (or simply standing on your bank account) is sufficiently risk-free.
