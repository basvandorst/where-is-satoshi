Hey BashCo! Sorry about all this. There is definitely some fishy stuff going on with the voting and we're working to mitigate and prevent this from happening in the future. Typically the anti vote-cheating measures we have in place catches this sort of thing, but some stuff does slip through from time to time. If you notice anything similar to this happening again please let us know. Thank you!

Ugh, sorry for the mess. If you haven't already, you can revoke access from the [apps page]( We'll investigate this closer as well.
I do have some good news in that [2FA is on the way]( The feature is currently out for moderators and will be rolled out for all users soon.

Indeed, we're excited to get this feature out to the masses!
Here's the [2FA help documentation]( if you want a sneak peek.

Hey all! I wanted to clarify what happened here. This domain was banned by our spam filter because it was being spammed excessively via PM. We have since removed the ban since we're no longer seeing the spam attack continue, and we're continuously working to improve our spam controls to reduce any further false positives. Apologies for any confusion this may have caused! If you need to reach us in the future you can do so by sending a [modmail to or emailing us at contact
