Short answer: current hash rate and accumulated proof of work.
Longer answer: most people in the crypto currency space expect Bitcoin to be the best and safest investment with the most user adoption, and certainly moreso than Bcash. Proof: the current hash rate and the current price of Bitcoin is higher, signaling that most miners/users/exchanges/wallets think Bitcoin is more valuable than Bcash.
There is no guarantee that this fact will hold true into the future, but for now (and for the entirety of the past 9 years) Bitcoin has had the backing of most crypto currency participants.
Bcash and other cryptos are called "alt coins" for a reason.

If the Bitcoin network were cut into two parts A and B (or more), each mining node would continue searching for a nonce for the block they are working on. The first valid block found will be broadcast to one side of the network, say side A, and side B will not hear about it. Eventually a miner on side B will find and broadcast to side B their own valid block.
Thus, the bitcoin network splits (forks) and each side hums along without knowing about our caring about the other, each adding blocks to their own chain.
If/when then network is reconnected, nodes on the side that had the shorter chain (less POW, more precisely) will discover the longer chain and will decide that it is in their own best interest to build on the longest chain. They will abandon the smaller chain, which will then be considered an orphaned chain. Transactions that were mined into blocks on the short chain but not on the long chain will find their way into each node's mem pool through the standard flooding protocol, where they will await to be included in a block.
Understanding this dynamic allows the bitcoin newcomer (like me) to understand why you might want to wait 6 or more confirmations before deciding a transaction is "real" or immutable. Internet problems that can't be routed around automatically are rare and don't last very long, but short lived network forks do happen and orphaned chains of two or more blocks do appear several tens of times a year.
Miners can never be 100% sure that the longest chain they know about is the longest chain on the planet.

Incorrect.  Blockchain is a database, nothing more nothing less. It is the most inefficient database ever invented, but its append-only structure allows for POW to act on it and therefore can allow for a degree of immutability (assuming enough hash power).


Incorrect. Immutability, and therefore trust, is obtained via proof of work. The blockchain by itself does not provide any type of immutability or trust, just like any other database does not provide immutability or trust.


Any database can be made transparent quite easily. Indeed, keeping a database secret is the hard thing to do.
No white paper was available when I wrote the post. Have they posted one? I agree that there are some big name investors listed, which for me lent some degree of legitimacy. Until I saw that at least one blockchain was being used with no apparent reason for using a block chain. Looking for immutability? You're going to need a native asset (i.e. yet another shitcoin) to do that.

Oh my I'm not going to be able to compete with you on text volume! You give a lot of detail, and I don't see any detail that I disagree with, but I don’t believe much of the detail provided makes the case for wasted energy. I'm going to try my best to present why the energy consumed by the Bitcoin network is useful and not wasted, and how, soon, the power consumption will be very acceptable.
 Why does the Bitcoin network use so much electricity?
Electricity consumption by the Bitcoin network is used to secure the network. Less power consumption = less security. The reason for this is that for an attacker to rewrite the blockchain they will have to overpower the network \(so called 51&amp; attack\), and if the network has more power than anyone or any group of governments can muster, then the network is more secure than the case where a corporation or government \*could\* overpower the network. I don’t think anyone doubts this, but I do believe many believe that too much electricity is used and that it would be acceptable to reduce the network security in order to reduce electricity consumption. I do not agree with that statement but it turns out that in the very near future we won’t need to make that trade\-off. But, I’m getting ahead of myself.
 Does the Bitcoin network use “too much” electricity?
A socialist government might come to that conclusion. A fair government would say that everyone should use electricity in proportion to what they are willing to pay for it. For example, do christmas lights use too much energy \([ Maybe. Who is in charge of deciding what use of electricity is “good” and what is “bad?” The truth is that a free and open market should decide. If you don’t get it… I don’t have the time to try to convince you. I am sorry.
 Is the Bitcoin network’s electricity consumption growing so fast that it is out of control?
No. The electricity consumption is controlled. Hear me out. It is useful to estimate how much energy is used by the network in the following way. The controlling feedback loop that increases or decreases the Bitcoin network’s mining power is right now the coinbase reward because it is a miner's primary source of revenue. If the value in $ of the coinbase reward \(awarded every 10 minutes on average\) goes up, miner’s revenue goes up and they are incentivized to add hashing power. **Price of BTC goes up, average mining power goes up**.
What happens if too much hashing power is added to the network? The most inefficient miners find that they are spending more on electricity than they are receiving in revenue, so they shut their inefficient rigs down which reduces the network hashing power. **Price of BTC goes down, average mining power goes down**. 
Thus, the hashing power is controlled by the price of Bitcoin compared to the price of electricity and computers. The hashing power is not “going up forever,” but it will go up when the price of 12.5 BTC goes up, and it will go down when the price of 12.5 BTC goes down. \(Ordering new rigs and facilities takes time, and the effect may lag the cause by 4 to 10 months\). Fun fact: note that on average it does not matter how efficient a mining rig is. If rigs are made more efficient on average, you will see more hashes/second *but you will not see a difference in how much money is spent on electricity \(in the long run\) because that is controlled by the amount of revenue received*. Understanding why this observation is true is crucial to understanding what drives electricity use in the Bitcoin network.
 Is too much electricity used by the Bitcoin network today on a per-transaction basis?
Absolutely. This is the reason that many folks are sounding alarm bells. What they fail to see is that with layer 2 networks like Lightning, the number of transactions per 10 minutes can be increased by a factor of 10\^6, 10\^9 or more without increasing the required hashing power. How is that possible? You’ll need to understand the basics of Lightning, but the short answer is that most on\-chain transactions will end up consisting of Lightning’s opening and closing of channels \(which are on\-chain transactions themselves\) and all of the millions of off\-chain transactions inside the Lightning channels can scale almost indefinitely \(not quite\) without affecting the hashing power.
 So the amount of electricity used will remain the same while the transaction volume can scale to millions or billions of transactions per second?
Yes. In essence, the Lightning network \(or similar\) will increase the capacity of the transaction network by 6 to 10 orders of magnitude, while the hashing power will not be affected except through the second order effect of the increasing price of BTC \(as described in the paragraphs above, “Price of BTC goes up, average mining power goes up.”\).
 Tell me again why ASICs and FinFET fabric chips matter when calculating how much money will be spent on electricity for mining now and in the future?
They don’t matter. At all. I’m not sure how to interpret arguments that include numbers like the as\-of\-today hashrate of computers or the as\-of\-today rate of increase in electricity usage. Those numbers may very well be right yet it has no material effect on where the mining power is headed over the next several years. If the miners double their profit per rig because of {insert your reason here it does not matter} then they will use some of that excess revenue to buy more rigs and electricity which increases the overall hashrate which increases the difficulty level which “re\-balances” the mining network to where it was before the doubling of the profit. If a new rig comes out that produces 10x the hashes with 50&amp; of the electricity, so what it does not change my calculation: If the miners are making a large profit they will increase their hashrate. If the miners are losing money they will decrease their hashrate by retiring their older rigs. It is a simple control loop that is ultimately driven by economics, not by technology.
 Oh my it looks like I CAN give you a run for your money in terms of text volume! Too bad we don’t get paid by the pound of text produced ;-)

Bitcoin's POW is not a luxury, and it is not a significant contributor to global warming. In the long run, as coinbase rewards go to zero, the amount of energy consumed will decrease. POW secured the network and my Bitcoin in a way that POS cannot.

It is not proof of money owned. It might be proof of money consumed. But it needs to be proof of money consumed that is *easily verified* by others, and verifying someone has consumed money and not just sent it to his friends is not really possible. Proof of work makes it possible to look at a number produced by a minor and easily estimate how much energy was consumed to produce that number, on average.
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:57:18
Wow lots of information, but none of it shows that the Bitcoin system uses more energy than the fiat system. The main problem for Bitcoin is that its costs are easily estimated, but the cost of fiat is spread out (printing, transporting from bank to bank and from merchant to bank, securing, secret service counterfeiting reduction).
Also, you are missing the point about POW and mining. 










These two reasons are true but you are missing the security proposition of POW. Because of POW, I *know* that a corporation or a government (or indeed a consortium of governments) cannot rewrite the block chain without spinning up a huge number of very large power plants. The power guarantees the integrity of the network. POS or centralized authority provide an inferior guarantee. This thermodynamic guarantee of bitcoin's integrity is the reason that Bitcoin is more secure than other cryptocurrencies. The energy is not "wasted". The energy is *REQUIRED.*
Even if you can show me that the Bitcoin network uses more energy than the fiat network, which you have not, that does not mean that the energy consumed by Bitcoin is wasted. The consumed and accumulated energy is in itself the main value proposition of Bitcoin. Plus, I claim (admittedly without data, for now) the energy used is LESS than the Fiat system.

You never provide a private key, ever, to anyone. Even to spend the coin.
What your wallet will do for you is use your private key to sign a transaction that your wallet constructs when you want to spend the coin. Your private key never leaves your wallet when completing a transaction. Some older wallets will allow you to export private keys for backup purposes. HD wallets are easier to backup and do it slightly differently.
Each address has one public key and one private key, no more and no less.

You are correct: mnemonic seed protection is important. When that seed lives in only two places, on paper and in your Trezor, the most likely way to get your bitcoin stolen is through the paper copy.
I recently had a new idea on how to protect your mnemonic seeds WITHOUT writing them down or recording them in any way \(except for inside Trezor\). I'm looking for constructive criticism to tell me why this won't work.
Three Blind Mice \(TBM\) is the name of the system.
The main drawback of TBM is the fact that you need 3 Trezors, about $300. Ledgers should work too; I've never owned one. $300 too much? Maybe not if you are securing more than a few thousand dollars. I personally don't have that much, but who knows? Maybe bitcoin will go "to the moon!" at which time a $300 lock may seem cheap.
Here are the benefits of  TBM:
1. No paper plain\-text secret mnemonic words to protect because the words live ONLY inside Trezor devices. There is no reason to worry that someone has sneaked a peak at your mnemonic words, and is now waiting for the right time to strike, because that would not be possible.
2. Any one of the Trezors can be lost/stolen with zero risk to your Bitcoin.
3. Any one of the Trezors can be hacked/accessed or have the keys extracted with no risk to your Bitcoin.
4. No need to remember any passphrases or any other secrets.
5. No one can discover your mnemonic seeds, ever. Not even you! But don't worry there is a way to recover from a lost/damaged/stolen Trezor.
Here is the protocol:
1. Buy 3 Trezors \(I like Trezor 1\)
2. Create 3 unique wallets, one in each Trezor
3. Use Electrum to create a 2\-of\-3 multisig address in such a way that you will need 2 of the 3 Trezors in order to spend the Bitcoin. Send your bitcoin to this address.
4. In a room with no cameras or microphones, backup your 3 Trezors to paper. After Trezor creates these secret words, Trezor will show you these mnemonic words only once \(Ledger?\).
5. Burn the paper with the mnemonic seeds directly after verifying those words back to your Trezor. Don't do it later, because you will always wonder "did anyone snap a pic of those and is now waiting for the right time to strike?" That thought will be in the back of your head every time you tell yourself that your bitcoin is safe.
6. Now no one on this planet, not even you, know those mnemonic words. Only your Trezors know those words, and they won't tell you what those words are a second time.
7. Do not set up a PIN on any of the Trezors \(or, if you do, realize that if you die the bitcoin dies with you. If you write down the PINs, then you are back to the original problem: how do you protect that secret that is written on paper?\)
8. Put one Trezor in a bank Safe Deposit box in another city. Put another Trezor at your sister's house in yet another city. Put the 3rd Trezor at your buddy's house in yet a 3rd city.
If you chose your 3 locations carefully, it is unlikely that the the people who have possession of those Trezors know the other 2 people. But if you die, they should know to contact your spouse/brother/sig.other who will then collect all 3 Trezors and therefor inherit your Bitcoin.
Notice that if any one of your Trezors is found by an attacker \(or secretly used by the person you trusted\), they cannot get at your bitcoin. An attacker needs at least 2 of the 3 Trezors to make use of them.
Check up on your Trezors every once in a while by calling your friend/sibling or taking a trip down to your safety deposit box to check that the Trezor is still there and still working.
If any one of your Trezors gets lost/broke/stolen/burned, then start over with 3 new wallets and then use the two remaining Trezors to send Bitcoin to your new 2\-of\-3 address. Recovery Successful!
Using the Three Blind Mice protocol, you don't have to remember ANY secrets. The Trezors will remember the secrets for you. And, no one can sneak a peak at those mnemonic words since the Trezor is very safe. And even if someone could hack your Trezor \(unlikely\), they would need to find 2 of them in order to take your bitcoin. You will need to hide your Trezors in 3 separate and secure locations, which is easier for most people than securing 24 words.
Any thoughts on how to defeat the Three Blind Mice protocol? Please let me know in a comment. Thank you!

Hi and thank you for your input.
I agree that having the mnemonic words gives you more options. However, having them also gives you more headaches like the headache that you can't allow anyone to sneak a peak at those words. Also, there is more than one software wallet that can be used with your Trezor. The government would need to shut them all down. Also, I can access the Trezor on my own using Python tools locally without any online wallet. So the attack you describe would be an inconvenience but not a show stopper.
Also, in an environment where the government was not attacking Bitcoin users and the Trezor website directly, the protocol I describe would be usable by even by relatively non techie people (but not my grandmother, granted).
Am I understanding you correctly, or have I missed something? I am genuinely interested in obtaining help from people like you in discovering how this setup might fail. You brought up an attack vector I had not considered, and I thank you for that.

Hi Joe! I agree with what you said above. I would caution you to not compare a 100 year old institution to a 9 year old upstart. Every criticism you mentioned in your response may be true TODAY, but the growth rate of bitcoin is undeniable. True, it is not usable to buy even 2&amp; of what you want to buy today. True, the Bitcoin community started small and is still small compared to wall street today, but you miss the point about the growth rate. True, in the US there is little need for this system today, and the tools for consumers are atrocious. But that is changing. I would keep one eye on the billions of dollars of VC money being dumped into this space. Those guys don't dump that kind of money into a space for this many years for no reason. Change is coming, and although Bitcoin, or a coin like it, has not yet eaten even 2&amp; of wall street's lunch, the growth rate should be cause for concern for everyone in your business.
I have a quick question for you: how many people do you have working on Blockchain? I am guessing that they will learn from your company for 4 to 12 months, then jump ship.

Every 10 minutes on average some minor is rewarded with a coinbase transaction (currently 12.5 Bitcoin) plus transaction fees. The amount of money that is needed to buy and maintain computer equipment, plus the amount of money needed for electricity, will in the long run equal the reward except for a small profit that is kept near zero by minor competition.
So you can't really reduce the amount of money used on consuming electricity, because a rational minor would then find a way to use some or most of the extra funds to increase the chances of winning the next reward, which would then consume about the same amount of energy that was originally saved.
{money received in rewards on average} is approx equal to {Money spent on mining} +{small marginal profit that is held close to zero by competition}

1. Keep user's coin (keys) secure from theft and secure from accidental loss.
2. User interface so simple that words are not required (and therefore it is usable by those that do not understand English in Africa and South America , and is usable by my grandmother)
3. Intuitive design that guides users who are new to Bitcoin to make intelligent decisions. They should not have to balance security and convenience. The first time user of the wallet, who never even heard of Bitcoin, should be able to guess the best and safest ways to transact and use the wallet even the very first time they use the wallet. Everybody understands "keep my money safe" but now they need to be guided to want to keep their *keys* safe.
The above requirements of the phone app will be hard hard hard to realize, but the reward will be a higher adoption rate for those that actually have a compelling use case right now (Venezuelans, Zimbabweans, and others).

One way to sweep a paper wallet is to use the Samourai or Mycelium apps (not sure if Samourai is available on IOS). Make sure to write down pencil on paper the 12 or 24 word mnemonic words that act as your wallet backup. You may need to find that functionality in the menu if you are not automatically asked to do so. Write down those words before sweeping your paper wallet. I know that is counter intuitive. Keep your words safe from prying eyes and safe from accidental loss, as those words are the keys to spending your Bitcoin. You will need those words when you get a new phone or lose your current phone.

Love me my Trezor1. I've held off on buying ModelT.
TrezorT vs. Trezor1:
1. TrezorT has a larger screen.
2. TrezorT has a color screen, Trezor1 is monochrome.
3. TrezorT has a touch screen, so recovering a wallet is much faster since the mnemonic words can be directly typed into the TrezorT. Trezor1 secure recovery is possible but takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.
4. Trezor1 requires your passphrase, if used, to be entered into the computer not the Trezor1. Therefore, a malware-infected computer can steal your passphrase but not your PIN.
5. TrezorT has a larger attack surface with the addition of the memory slot.
6. TrezorT hardware and firmware are from -scratch. I'm assuming long-term this will make the TrezorT more secure, but in the short term the device should be considered less secure simply because it has withstood fewer attacks globally.

OK so we are in agreement that neither of us can calculate if bitcoin uses more energy than fiat.










I'm not sure what your point is. Mining takes energy \*by design.\* The energy is not wasted, but you seem to say that since most hashes are not used then they are wasted. You miss the very essence of POW. An attacker would need to also expend this much energy, and it is unlikely that anyone \(including colluding governments\) can mount such an attack \*and that is by design.\* Your waste is everyone else's security.
How much energy is used? You have pointed to lots of data that shows that energy is consumed. \*We know that. It is by design.\* I have an easier way to know how much energy is used today, and how much will be used in the future \(at least until the coinbase become negligible\). Take the value of the bitcoin that is awarded every 10 minutes \(coinbase transactions currently at 6.25 BTC, plus miners fees offered on a per\-transaction basis\) and convert that money into mining computers and electricity, with a small amount saved for profit. That is exactly how much value will be spent on electricity and computers on average in the long run. If the price of each bitcoin goes to $1M, and someone is getting 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes, then all of the miners, in aggregate, will spend about $6.25M \(minus computer costs and small profit\) on electricity every 10 minutes.
Now that is a lot of power, and at 7 transactions per second the power consumption per transaction is absurdly high \*now.\* But with layer 2 networks such as lightning this number will but cut by a factor of 1M or even higher.
After the coinbase award becomes negligible \(will be zero in 2041\), then the amount of $ spent on electricity will be governed only by the amount that people are willing to offer the miners in fees. The market will correct that number to the exact amount that the users \(people paying the fees\) think the resulting security is worth it.


Please re\-read your above statement. You claim the miner's motive is not network integrity, but profit. Again, \*this is by design.\* If you are proposing a network that is secured by miner's willingness to mine because it helps the network rather than by profit, your network will be less secure than any network on earth. Bitcoin has incentivized the miners to chase profits and to the miners the resulting network security is a side benefit, not what they are aiming for. This is part of Bitcoin's magic: All participants are incentivized to do what is best for the network, and the way to make the most profit \*by design\* is also what is best for the network.
Edit:  I got ahead of myself and claimed that the current coinbase reward is  6.25 BTC. In fact, the current coinbase reward is 12.5 BTC and is not  scheduled to become 6.25 BTC until sometime 2020.

The idea is for the US government to repay the debt AFTER inflation has reduced the value of the dollar. It would be much much harder to pay down the debt with a non-inflationary currency such as Bitcoin. If you believe that the US government will need inflation in order for it to be able to pay the debt, as I do, then buying Bitcoin now is one way to go.

It is possible to use the keyboard to input your recovery mnemonic words. And you are correct that doing so is dangerous. But the best practices way of entering these mnemonic words into a Trezor1 does not rely on the keyboard and is as secure as the ModelT's method. See "secure recovery" in the documentation. As mentioned above, this process is inconvenient as it takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete.

There. Is. No. Waste.
The energy consumed is worth the benefit of a permissionless distributed currency, and is LESS THAN the energy used by the US Dollar (on a per dollar basis). When/if Bitcoin becomes larger than the US Dollar, it will still consume less energy per currency unit. Think: no armored trucks, no printing presses, no security for housing cash.

Great article. It confirms that the financial incumbents still don't have any clue about what Bitcoin is, nor do they appreciate the disruption potential that Bitcoin represents to their business.


LOL that is such an old and boring and discredited line of reasoning. I can't believe after so much time that otherwise intelligent people think that the most boring part of Bitcoin, the inefficient database structure called the blockchain, is somehow going to be used by their company to improve their company's efficiency. Bitcoin uses the inefficient blockchain because it allows distributed verification of the past transactions and blocks that verifiably have had country sized amounts of power expended to create. If you want to fool a Bitcoin node you have to expend the same amount of energy as was spent by the network, which would be a tall order for even several colluding governments. Vanguard does not need this, so the proof of work is discarded and what remains is a highly inefficient spreadsheet. The financial incumbents, including Vanguard, can see only the blockchain and they think it is the secret sauce of Bitcoin. I find it fascinating how easily they are distracted while their lunch is being eaten by Bitcoin.

I know the following advice does not help you, but it may help someone else who is just getting into crypto.
If you own your own Bitcoin keys, your cryptocurrency is safer than if you entrust your keys with another person or company. If you don't own your Bitcoin Keys, you are relying on others who may or may not be as diligent about your money as you would be. In this particular case, it seems that someone was careless, and that particular someone included people from coinbase and people from the David Pakman show. Again, if you own your Bitcoin keys, this snafu *cannot* happen to you.
The entire purpose of cryptocurrency is so that you can remove your trust from everyone else, and take complete control of your money. When you trust your crypto to someone else like coinbase, you open yourself to trusting others with your money.
Your keys, your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Start here:

Bitcoin are only spendable if the private key is available. People like to keep their private Keys private, so other people can't spend their Bitcoin. It is not possible to know if someone who is keeping their private Keys private can produce on demand those keys, or have lost those keys.
Some people assume that if Bitcoin has been spent recently, then the private Keys have not been lost. Using this logic, bitcoins that were created a long time ago and have not since been moved are likely to have had their keys lost. No one knows for sure.

Incorrect. Instead of tracking satoshis, start tracking millionths if a Satoshi. So instead of owning 1.00000000 bitcoins, you would own 1.00000000000000 bitcoins. Both are equal to 1 Bitcoin.

If you sold crypto A at a gain in year X, you will owe capital gains tax on that gain. If during the same year you sold crypto A at a loss, you can use that loss to offset the gain. The two taxable events, if they occurred in the same calendar year, offset each other if the gain amount equals the lots amount.

User adoption is key to increased value, both in terms of $/BTC and in terms of usefulness to society.
I routinely give $10 in Bitcoin to people I know with only one stipulation: they have to promise to find someone in their circle of friends (but not in mine) and give them half of it.

This is where we disagree. Further dividing something does not increase it's supply.  Let's say that as Bitcoin keys were lost and therefore the price of bread decrease (since each remaining Satoshi is worth more), at some point a loaf would cost 1 Satoshi. Now suppose you want to buy a half a loaf of bread. That would be 0.5 Satoshi, but you could not pay that amount. By further dividing, you would then be able to buy half a loaf. If I increased the supply of Bitcoin, as you suggested, then the cost of the loaf would increase to, say, 2 Satoshi.
Further dividing something does not increase it's supply. If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have (additional) time to try to convince you, sorry.

When you buy one BTC on an exchange, you don't get any Bitcoin. You get an I.O.U for 1 Bitcoin. 
When you redeem that I.O.U by transferring your Bitcoin to your wallet (Example: Trezor or Samouria), your Bitcoin is transferred to one and only one address. You know this because if your Bitcoin were to have arrived in 7 pieces, you would have had to supply your exchange with 7 Bitcoin addresses. Since you supplied only one address, all Bitcoin you receive will show up at that one address. No shards.

The pool of available Bitcoin will shrink because of loss of keys. Each remaining Bitcoin will become worth more when this happens.

All mining nodes are continuously trying to add a block of transactions to the chain of blocks with the greatest Proof Of Work. If the network is cut in half, then two chains will be maintained until the network mends. At that time the chain with the least amount of POW will be abandoned by all of the nodes that become aware of the higher POW chain. No miners want to spend $ on electricity to add to a chain that is about to be abandoned, and all miners are highly motivated to take the most likely path towards claiming a block reward on the chain that they estimate to be most likely to win.

It is a common mistake confuse Bitcoin addresses with individual people.
Most people's wallets contain tens or hundreds or thousands of addresses. To the end user it just looks like one amount.

Thank you for the helpful and friendly advice for me to learn how to observe fee levels! Oh wait - I had just done that, and was sharing the news to encourage others to do that too. I'm glad we are both promoting education! Also, there is no effect between me observing fee levels and the amount that others on the network offer as a fee - despite your claim to the contrary. Again, education in a fun way is key!

Do you mean that Hester might want people to have the option to invest in Bitcoin ETPs in order to make money for herself?

Early, or otherwise? There may be a penalty depending on your answer.

"By precluding approval of cryptocurrency-based ETPs for the  foreseeable future, the Commission is engaging in merit regulation.  Bitcoin is a new phenomenon, and its long-term viability is uncertain.  It may succeed; it may fail. The Commission, however, is not well  positioned to assess the likelihood of either outcome, for bitcoin or  any other asset. Many investors have expressed an interest in gaining  exposure to bitcoin, and a subset of these investors would prefer to  gain exposure without owning bitcoin directly. An ETP based on bitcoin  would offer investors indirect exposure to bitcoin through a product  that trades on a regulated securities market and in a manner that  eliminates some of the frictions and worries of buying and holding  bitcoin directly. If we were to approve the ETP at issue here, investors  could choose whether to buy it or avoid it. The Commission’s action  today deprives investors of this choice. I reject the role of gatekeeper  of innovation—a role very different from (and, indeed, inconsistent  with) our mission of protecting investors, fostering capital formation,  and facilitating fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Accordingly, I  dissent."
\- Hester M. Peirce, Commissioner

Every 10 minutes, 12.5 BTC, plus about 0.5 BTC in fees, are awarded to a miner.
You can bet all of your lunch money that in the long run  a little less than 13BTC*6500$/BTC=$84,500 is being spent every 10 minutes trying to get the next reward.
The details get complicated quickly, but the fundamental truth remains the same: (amount spent on chasing block rewards)≈95%(value of block rewards) where the 95% number approaches but never reaches 100%.
The largest complication to this simple model is that miners need to speculate on the future electricity costs and Bitcoin price to arrive at the correct amount of money to invest today since your mining rigs will run for 6 to 9 months. Also requiring speculation: fees collected, how much other miners are investing in rigs since you will be competing with them for a slice of the pie.

tl;dr: "rather than using [the suspicious] secp256r1 like nearly all other applications, Bitcoin uses secp256k1 which uses Koblitz curves instead of pseudorandom curves and is still believed to be secure. Now the decision to use secp256k1 instead of secp256r1 was made by Satoshi..."
My conclusion is that Bitcoin is safe from this particular weakness. AmIWrong?

How to accept bitcoin
1. Download a wallet on Android or IOS \(example: Mycelium\)
2. Backup your 12 words: use paper and pencil
3. Generate a bitcoin address \(On "balance" tab, press "receive"\)
4. Advertise the address to anyone and everyone

In the year you received the"free" coin, you should report it as wage income (report the value of the coin on the day you took possession of the coin). In the year you sell the coin, you need to report the gain as capital gains income.

Hey thanks for that! Funny how this dummy still has his Bitcoin, and someone as smart as you has allowed his Bitcoin to be stolen. Weird how that works. My advice to you: keep on giving out your Bitcoin keys to people you don't know, I'm sure it will work out great for you!

You are correct that today's crypto system is not yet ready for everyone. But we are at the very beginning of the adoption curve, there is a huge group of talented developers, and innovation is coming fast. It is unclear if insurance will play a role when we are at 85%+ adoption because we don't yet know what problems will remain after all of that innovation.
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:52:35
From my point of view, the insurance is unnecessary, and in this case a distraction, from what is important. 
Trxth's list of important-features-not-easily-replicated was good:
 - network effect
 - decentralization (degree of)
 - number &amp; quality of active developers
 - hash rate

If/When the US government collapses, I'm pretty sure you are going to want to have a fair amount of bitcoin (or of whatever cryptocurrency then-currently has the highest market cap).

False. Replicating Bitcoin's hashrate, and therefore security, is out of reach of all or most governments. This is precisely why Bitcoin is valuable.

I see. I am unfamiliar with how the keys are stored when running a full node. I'm cautiously optimistic that if you copied over "all" the files, you have the keys somewhere. I wish you good luck, and hope someone more knowledgeable than I chimes in soon for you.

This article states that Bitcoin is vulnerable but does not offer one small shred of evidence. It does not even attempt to offer a reason why this conclusion might be supported. "The sky is falling!" Click. Bait.

You seem to have a healthy attitude to keeping your coins safe. Coinbase (or any other custodial wallet where you don't control the keys) is generally considered the least safe type of wallet, but in fact it is better than moving your coin around if you don't know what you are doing because you can lose the coin forever. Education is key, and you seem to know that.
I suggest you start here:

Yet another shitcoin: NewYorkCoin.
Noob note: the "improvements" mentioned above have already been tried by other coins, and none of them are anywhere near as big or as secure as Bitcoin, and they are not threatening either. The price of NewYorkCoin is low and will get even lower in the near future. Keyword: Near. Network effects are strong and the power of the Bitcoin network will not soon be surpassed.

That would be nice, but the answer is no. There are two parts of proof of work: performing calculations that require work, and, crucially, having others be able to quickly and easily VERIFY you did the work. Hashing a block to a sufficiently small number is both hard to do and easy for anyone to verify. The work you propose is indeed work but it cannot be easily verified and is therefore not suitable.
Note the incorrect statement in your question:


My friend, I'm afraid you don't understand that the energy is not wasted, it is the way the blockchain is secured.
