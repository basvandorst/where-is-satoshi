There were many competing computer networks...
I also wouldn't discount first mover advantage for Bitcoin.

Remarkable, they've taught an owl how to use Reddit!
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:49:44
There are plenty of blockchains that aren't built on top of the Bitcoin network though... Bitcoin honestly just has the first mover advantage.

The winky face is a nice touch.

You need a new bank...
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:37:24
Really? I thought we were past this as a society :/
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:52:45
I'm all for free speech, but it's just upsetting that that's still a pervasive opinion.

well I just think I found the worst sub on the internet.

wtf is 4d printing

hooray for casual homophobia!

Depends on your bank

I think he cut himself on that edge.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:35:51
Right, but it's a lot more difficult for someone to find the private key than it is for them to find the public key and simply send him an email.

On the armory Google code site, there's a bundle for offline install, with all the dependencies for 10.04, so I thought one for 12.04 would be useful. There is honestly no need to attack me.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:14:21
Thanks for the tip :D
Am I doing this right?

bitcoin don't give a fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:31:44
80 bytes? that's not even enough for one transaction!
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:27:29
Tip less on more on the rest of reddit.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:37:25
I took as many 3s as coinbase would let me, then got some free coins from faucets. you get more than a third.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:26:44
Lovely. I didn't know electrum had an offline client.  Are there any drawbacks (aside from relying on a centralized service) to electrum vs. armory?
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:24:06
They're not safe to store money in, as the person selling them knows the private key...
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:28:59
Duquesne Light? plz. I'd love to pay my power bill in BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:45:59
Because there's no way to run an apt-get install if you're offline. If you want to do an online install, it will autoresolve all the dependencies. There's no way to do that offline.  But for the record, I had to redownload all the libqt4 stuff, libqtgui4, all of their dependencies, and all the python dependencies.

Looking at forex rates, I paid very minimal spread just Friday - 182 USD for 160 EUR (including ATM fee, which gets reimbursed, 163 EUR).  It depends on your bank.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:26:46
You don't need smartphones. Tons of online wallets offer SMS gateways.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:58:37
but people need a way to get bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:32:32
much appreciated
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:43:22
Also, to verify that it's the original sender, have him send back a small amount from the transaction.  that way, nobody could claim it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:00:21
According to them, all their plans are unlimited data, and they throttle at of 500 mb 2.5 GB or never depending on their plan.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:50:05
haha, I only have 0.000124BTC as of now.  Waiting for coinbase to put in verification deposits...
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:21:23
T-Mobile does.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:32:03
uhhh. what reporter doesn't do research on what they're talking about... "They're trading the company bitcoin...?" "On the secondary market?" Also, Baidu does money transfers now.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:54:15
I've never gotten tipped :/

Seriously? It looks ancient. It still has a floppy drive.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:07:08
but be careful, or you could freeze your funds.
