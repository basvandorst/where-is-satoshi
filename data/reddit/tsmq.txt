you do realize some people mine their own coins.....
also why reply and dodge the question when my post was literally only about the question? seems kinda weird that you have to change the subject but okay

hey maybe cut down on the adjectives, are you trying to make a point or write a book?

i mean more people will read it if its short and to the point but to each their own
i definitely liked this one better

im actually one of the few people that you will converse with that never created a account I only read stuff on it if its sourced from somewhere else like here to see if its real
but i kinda agree with you. jack sells joe some of his btc for way cheaper then market atm(but still higher then jack paid), jack/twitter pushes btc, JRE pushes btc, jack remaining btc is way higher and joe made even more money off the cheaper coins he got then if he sells asap at todays market price

or just dont waste peoples time, you could have said it in 2-3 sentences.
you basically said in a very basic summary jack and joe are doing/or will be doing insider trading or got some btc for free, based off ether info jack knows, or they will use their social media followers to push the price and will dump on everyone else. Also alex jone has/will be the scape goat for this.
(hes the scape goat for everything)

Here is a few since you didn't think that that through at all
1. It's almost as if as you get older your wealth increases.....
2. kids just getting out of high school putting all their money into college are gonna have a real lot of money to invest......
3. 12  year olds trying to explain to their parents that they need money for crypto currencies when the parents dont even know what it is, yeah never gonna happen

true I didn't think about what people do in eu we are from different places, but my point was you need money to buy anything stocks or crypto and  usually super young people dont have money when they are in high school/college they spend most of there time at school unless they start working right away
