And the relevance it bitcoin is...?

Its probably a combination of the huge price jump hurting confidence, along with the 0.65% fee making it extremely difficult to profit from daytrading without large swings in the price(think about it, 0.0065 * 28 = 0.1820 means that the difference in your buy and sell to be profitable has to be greater than this). Daytraders(basically sophisticated market makers) are what give stability to markets by adding liquidity on both sides.

Circuit breakers don't stop the underlying value of bitcoin from deteriorating, they can only *temporarily* spread market volatility over a longer period of time. In that respect I don't think they are useful for bitcoin exchanges right now, if you want to reduce volatility get more volume going on them.

In the absence of real market makers, daytraders are all the market has currently. And regardless of whether or not daytraders are supplying liquidity, the fee argument still applies - Market Makers have to make money by buying and selling at the same time, and that is very difficult to do and keep prices stable at the same time if you have to position your bids and asks tens of pennies apart because of fees.

Yes I agree that in general they are just leeches, but in this extremely immature market they are all we have currently. I'm just hoping mtgox can become aware of these issues so that they don't persist longer than necessary.

There's been a general flight to cash in everything lately, even Gold is off its highs. Wait a little while for the news to sink in and people to realize what is going on, then maybe we'll see a little bit of a rise in price. More likely though the bitcoin market is just too small, and other factors are overriding currently.
