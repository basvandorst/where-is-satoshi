TA is difficult, and you need to have a big folio and to control your emotions to make small % over time...
I made money in this bear market, to each their strategy, I do my research on lots and lots of projects and mark when they're going to be listed on exchanges like idex... let's say project X has a good team and great whitepaper and github and usecase, but they raised 4 million in their ICO and because of the bear market and few updates from the team (because they're working on the actual project), their market cap is 1 million $, this isn't rare at all, happened with holo then quant then chx then lto network then fantom then vidt, so i buy early on idex and i take profits gradually and keep a bag for long term, with time you know exactly which projects have good fundamentals, it's like trading pink sheets, but pink sheets with actual fundamentals... now I'm on vidt and will sell some later when it gets enough attention and buy something else, rinse and repeat, just because it's the bear market doesn't mean you can't make money.
Now this is out of subject since you asked about TA, but trading is trading, with TA you're trading against bots and some of them use advanced algorithms to do TA and go against the market, it's more difficult to win against those, I'd rather trade with/against human nature, humans see an undervalued project and they will buy it, if I bought early enough and I'm happy with my roi and see a more undervalued project, I sell and get in the next, if not I hold long term. to each their own strategy, what's important is finding one that works for you.
