Not sure how stating the obvious invalidates my argument bitcoin offers banks very little potential profit while blockchain technology could offer them a whole lot more.
Do you even understand the point I tried to make? Or the article did for that matter.

Sure haha. That's kinda true. And the whitepaper sure is a great source too for the potential the tech underlying bitcoin has.

You friend don't understand the potential of blockchain technology. Look up Etherium for starters.
It's all about transaction / action without third parties because there is no need for trust, as the blockchain provides validity / backing. Which explains the heavy emphasis on 'trust' and the possibility for the entire banking sector, not just simple savings, to become obsolete.
I am starting to feel was the wrong place to post this.

Why would he talk about bitcoin? That's exactly the part of cryptocurrency the bank is uninterested in. It's all the rest, mainly blockchain technology the banks need to invest in (read: could try and corrupt) if they want to ride this cryptocurrency wave.

Because to exchange your btc you need to give it to them first. See?

Ah, well that's the old convenience vs security problem isn't it. The harder you make it for people to remember their password the more likely they're going to compromise their account's security by writing it down or such.
Until security gets easy, people will have their assets stolen. Like back in Roman times. :]
