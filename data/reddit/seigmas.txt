I bought BTC at 1000, my kom kept said I wasted my money and it was all a scam, so I sold at 1500 to show her that I actually got my money back.
... Few months later BTC skyrocketed till 20k.
Since then I just HODL

As a 22yo, I'm also putting my savings in BTC. I value my money a lot, but I value my ideals even more. I have faith in the technology behind BTC and for what it represents to me.

There are many wallets that do not store your private keys in a central server, for example Electrum.
Of course if you use a wallet that only runs on your web browser, you have to deal with a central server keeping those infos for you, and that's why they are not secure.
I guess you know that you shouldn't keep your cryptos on online wallets (hot-wallets)

I just think that with the progressive adoption of BTC, the price will stabilize as more investors will approach the market. So I'm quite sure the next BTC rallies will progressively be less consistent than the last big one in 2017.  
So far so good for mass adoption.

i don't see how a program made to support families with more children can help you get a corvette, since 130 bucks per month per children will not get you anywhere.
I heard stories of parents basically farming children just to get this bonus, but even with that, it's not an income big enough to buy you such a car

I don't understand the last point. It's still a program to incentivate poorer families to make children, as probably the richer ones will not have any interest in those 500zl per month, but for the poorer ones, it can make a difference in having another child or not.

more than price, I hope we will be able to shop around with BTC

I'm starting to think that BTC is WAY TOO scarce.
Let's assume global adoption happens, it becomes impossible to use BTC, because even 1 satoshi becomes too high in value to pay for small stuffs, plus fees as we know them would become too much expensive.
I think we will see satoshis further divided into more decimals, and fees will need to be restructured accordingly
