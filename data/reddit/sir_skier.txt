That can't be the link to the original transaction you were gifted. 
Look at your wallet address where the btc were sent. What do you see?

You really should create the wallet on a computer that hasn't been online, and then back up that wallet.  
There are several places online that can guide you through.
Making a new wallet on your existing PC and deleting the software, etc, won't prevent someone from recovering the deleted files.
I'd go with option 1, but if I cared that much I'd go through the process for complete cold storage with paper wallet back up and storage in a bank safety deposit box.

With an ATM you'd get the BTC delivered to am address of your choosing instantly, No?
With an exchange your BTC remains there until you choose to withdraw and in the meantime you do t control the asset. Theoretically they could sell more BTC than they own in an exchange.

Insuring deposits of cash is expensive, it doesn't matter the currency.  Fees would have to substantially increase
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:39:03
Try walking into your bank and withdrawing all your money. If you have even a moderate amount, you will be denied. 
If you believe that Bitcoin won't work, then there will be no need to ban it because it will fail on its own like beenz.

If I could get back the BTC I used to purchase some mining by the GH that would be great.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 01:49:29
The exchanges people refer to are trading platforms. You can buy and sell.  You can buy at the market rate or you can be place buy and sell orders at particular values. 
Wiring money to a website in another country doesn't give immediate feedback. Its a pain to wire the funds, and they have to clear before the BTC is released.

Doesn't an ATM transfer the coins to your address on your phone?
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:53:32
My company does this. I should also add the minimum requirement bit. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:18:34
I concur with this.  I've had good experiences. And any fees I've paid haven't been too annoying in my mind. There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Valuing a growth stock like uber is far different from valuing a store of value and medium of exchange like Bitcoin. 
If uber could use their platform to extract value from every cab ride on the planet, that would mean lots of cash flow for investors. If they could use their platform to extract cash from many many instantly delivered services, well, they might be worth a lot based on that stream of cash flow.
If Bitcoin turned out to be the predominant method to transfer value online, well, supply vs demand.

This article is terrible in its arguments. Just because Bitcoin is "software all the way down" and humans can make mistakes it's bad. Compare that to fiat which has backed up transactions and has deposit insurance. 
WTF. How does one rebut an Atlantic article?

While I find a few of the points in the article interesting, being a Green Beret and an Int. Sgt. doesn't make an expert on the topic.
He's bootstrapping an argument from existing anecdotes as far as I can tell.  He might be right in spots but it's not a rigorous thought experiment.

People outside the US realize they have decent healthcare and social safety nets while at the same time having reasonably regulated capital markets and the ability to earn a decent living.   I don't mind paying tax when I know I'm getting decent but not amazing value for it.

The other thing to add is that the major banks do provide services and products that go beyond simply moving money around.  Advisory services, financing, legal services, audit, and various financial products whether you think they make sense or not.
OP is comparing Apples to Oranges. 
It'd be difficult to compare the power usage of the whole bitcoin ecosystem to that of one bank, but I'm not sure why it matters.
It might be more interesting to compare it to the infrastructure required to run the interac network and instant-tellers.

This goes to show that bitcoin really needs to become much more widely distributed and out of the hands of the people who hold hundreds or thousands of BTC. 
We've got the same situation right now, but worse, with Fiat. The top 1% hold substantially all of the asset and the market is not a level playing field. 
I don't have the answer but it doesn't make sense to me how to incent wider adoption and natural redistribution of wealth. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:41:09
This information is already priced into the market. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:14:35
It's not a want to thing. But there's two fundamental problems in my mind.
First. For the BTC economy to grow, the velocity of the flow has to pick up massively and that's not going to happen when wealth is held by relatively so few.  (And they seem to be holding no matter what)
Second, and this is nothing new, BTC is distributed even less evenly than wealth in the general population.  When this happens, the general population gets resentful. They don't understand the benefits relative to Fiat. They're sceptical. And this therefore reduces the ultimate value. I still have very intelligent friends who just laugh at "magic internet money."
Again, I don't have the answers, but I'm worried about the fact BTC is so concentrated in so relatively few hands. It's not like the internet where it's relatively costless to get involved, or traditional banking and investing where there the system incentives getting new consumers involved. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:24:29
This is true.  Bitcoins need to be able to pass the "Spouse Test"

Great summary of what I suspected.  My belief is that large institutions are slow to pick up on new trends due to social inertia and compensation models. 
Now perhaps a few wealthy people could swing the very ill-liquid market? Perhaps.  Maybe some shady characters who wear leather jackets?  Possible.

I'm sure there is someone on here that could calculate the odds of someone dying each year, with the increasing probability as time goes by.  I'm guessing there's a significant probability that he's truly unavailable for comment, although odds are it was of a heart attack or car accident.

Agreed. I had a limit order in for $140 that I had moved up from 120 a few hours ago, so it got fulfilled automatically. It's very hard to time the market though, so I wouldn't worry too much.  Keep a high sell and a low buy order on the books to take advantage of the odd swing.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:03:31
The first chart seems reasonable. Plot it with upper and lower 90th percentiles. 
The bottom image is misleading. R^2 on that is nowhere near where it needs to be for that line to be significant.

Did you eventually figure it out?  After logging in there's a kind of popup window, although it's not a new "Window"  and it says a lot of text and then, "Refund" or "Accept". You'll select one of them, and then, Next time you log in, your order status will have changed.

Please overlay your "mathematical model" over the chart and indicate your variable values.  You don't have enough cycles I think as a quarter of the chart shows the price hovering at $135.
Only new information, and much more demand, will move this market.  Look for leading indicators of raising or lowering demand.  then profit.

Nice. That's great

I got interviewed for this article, although my stuff didn't make it to print.  She really did a good job of summarizing the current situation.  
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:32:55
This was a good series but nobody should take it as the regular state of affairs.  I have a mixed opinion as it makes it seem too easy to live on BTC, being in San Francisco, but it also, IMO, makes it seem too hard as BTC is still in early adoptor phase.  In 6 months it'll be a different story.
And really, is BTC really a mechanism to use exclusively?  It'd be like saying you're only going to use gold, or you're only going to use debit cards to live.  Your landlord won't want to accept debit cards either.

Understood, but for this kind of email, there's not really a need to track traffic.  Some systems have the option to turn off tracking.  The tracking doesn't give any insight into customer behavior, and you can't tell if the link is theirs as they aren't running the tracking url through their own domain, which is possible in most email automation systems.  Although presumably most receiving email systems are checking the spf record to prove it comes from them, for potentially financially sensitive info, it's best to have a clear link to know where you're going.
Anyway, I do marketing automation stuff, and I'm bored while trying to log in. :-)
