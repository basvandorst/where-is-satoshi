They are bitcoin savvy enough to set up a BTC coffee shop, but have never heard of reddit?
Seems legit
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:09:08
Wow, apparently you have to be paranoid to the point of delusion to see the inherent flaws in the banking system, TIL.

Is there an android app that syncs good with my computer for importing music though? Also, podcasts? This is the ONLY thing holding me back and has been for a while

I get student rate too, which is 4$ a month at my bank (bank of montreal) anyways if my comment was interpreted as supporting this rate it wasn't I was just making the point that ATM fee's aren't really free. But I suppose the original point was just that that's how it would be viewed by the public anyways
To me I kind of see this along the lines of early adopter price barrier entry, as in yeah, that's a really big fee to charge, but they are paying 20k for the machine and perhaps getting people to buy into BTC who found purchasing them over the web to be too difficult, time consuming or whatever else. Hell I've seen way worse price gouging on localbitcoins. Market competition will bring it down in time, for now it's a too high for sure, but if it brings in more people, then maybe it's ok
The other unfair comparison is that with a bank, you have an account, with money deposited in it that they can move around and make money off of investing your money, which encourages them to offer low or no fee's on accounts. With this, you don't have an account with them, you're just paying them for a one time service, to sell you bitcoin, a fledgling currency that they are taking a risk by investing 20k in this machine and renting the space and electricity.

To the mantle!
@_date: 2014-01-29 19:40:21
Of course you pay a monthly fee for your account so it is included in that, it's not "free" unless you're balling and have a free account for how much money you have in it..  
in which case you probably don't need a free account anyhow...
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:08:32
Done, thank you

I've depreciated a cool four cents in first in the past couple hours :/

All I can think of is goddamnit this world fucking needs bitcoin so badly. I'm watching a history of WWII, and the hell on earth that central banking has unleashed is so ungodly, my fuck we need this. Yes, I want to become financially independent and free to do as I wish with my life, but more than anything I truly want release from this current fiat system and a more *free* world. I don't necessarily care that it BE bitcoin to deliver that, but it seems like one of the absolute frontiers of the battle.
I just wish we could make people care more, people see more. It's so frustrating to see people try to quibble about the technical benefits of bitcoin, ok, it is not better on every front, on some it is far superior and on some it is par for the course or perhaps worse however the ideological benefits, for individual empowerment of the human being and the human race as an entity, are enormous. Most people have come to love their cages but I have not, and nothing but freedom from oppression will suffice for me.

Yes but in a way that you win

At the moment less than 1 but soon I'm going to be ordering a couple, within the next couple months
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:16:12
My thoughts exactly, one of the many reasons I love BTC. And for that there will be a cost (going into the future it will NOT be 5%, that's for sure)

What do you use as your itunes replacement?
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:03:59
Nova Scotia. What does Ripple have to do with anything?
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:12:32
Many apologies you had to go through that. You probably will survive, and maybe someone who hadn't seen it now has
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:24:15
OK, that's what I was thinking. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-05 22:51:13
Ok that's interesting but I can't find info on any banks in Canada that use Ripple
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:58:27
Ok, interesting. So the bitcoin network has split into multiple, divergent networks in the past? So there are multiple versions of bitcoin floating around out there? 
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:01:58


so your taxes ...  are tax deductible... wat?
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:34:46
I'm not saying it's not a high fee I'm just saying if you pay for your bank account, then you pay for your atm fee. Where I'm at the only bank that doesn't charge any monthly account charge to my knowledge is Presidents Choice financial, and it's basically using your grocery store as your bank, ie it's not that great. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:20:29
Yeah I get that I just love having a program on my computer (itunes) where I can rate my music, put it into playlists, generally organize it and then import from there directly onto my device (iphone). The amount of music I have makes this functionality very important to me, as if my music is just in its respective folders on my computer, I wont be able to use it effectively.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:49:36
This just happened to me too, I withdrew an entire bitcoin, and have not received it! I withdrew it on the 3rd
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:59:24
How is this different from having to pay sales tax on every fiat purchase?
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:43:54
To be fair, the internet is *still* like 90% scams lol

Makes sense. I was selfishly hoping for a crash, so I could get some cheap, but this is pretty cheap as is, as you stated.

BTC has flaws, everything does, but the flaws of BTC seem to be much less than the flaws of fiat. And to say it has no purchasing power is obviously untrue. It does not exist only to increase in value, it exists to provide an alternative to the greenback and a more efficient transaction flow of money, among many other reasons.

And, say I am a miner, how would I be notified of this change and be allowed to vote on it?

I'm in Halifax and would like this list; also you should post it that would be very useful

You must be new here

Can you explain how this works for a newb who's only trading experience is in cryptos?
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:59:51
Whatever ideology you may be, the state has a way of persuading those who don't agree with court convictions into going along with them. Ancap or no, the kingsmen will come for you. 


I've tried to figure out what you're trying to say here but I'm not sure what it is, sorry.
Is Roger Ver?
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:48:35
Ok I gotcha thanks for explaining. Are you saying you believe that Roger doesn't believe the act of hiring a hitman is wrong, or a crime?
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:29:11
Ah, the mystical "social contract"
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:10:14
It looks like we have a couple mutual friends. How does it work? Bitstamp accepts Ripple, is that correct?
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:40:08
Ok, so I guess that goes back to my original question of who exactly the dev's are that are implementing the changes to the infrastructure, and how they got that position. Are they people appointed by the guy that created Bitcoin, Satoshi?
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:27:04
Ross is not on trial for the allegation of hiring a hitman, and this was never proven only alleged. All can go in is the crime for which he was convicted, not the one that was alleged, possibly invented by the state to make him seem like more of a scary boogeyman. We won't ever know. 
I believe people here support the innocence of Ross in the crimes for which he was convicted, as they support the innocence of all other people convicted of crimes which are victimless. If he did indeed hire a hitman, that is not a victimless crime, and I don't think anyone here would support that.

Ironic considering BTC is all about decentralized power...

As far as I understood it, you mail them gold and then they give you a receipt of your gold holdings with them. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 06:58:26
He got found guilty on all counts, and I don't think he was even eligible for a plea bargain so what kind of "deal" could he have secured by giving up the BTC?

How do you use EFT? I looked into it and it looked like way more work and bank involvement than using interac

Is there a way to see how long I have been a member of this subreddit?

I guess you would have used the same argument for alcohol prohibition?
As an aside, [ever heard of little story?](
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:38:57


Thank you so much for this. It's such a little understood thing, and I find people look down on you or view you funny if you are estranged from shitty parents. People just don't get it. And man, fuck it, not all people are good people, lots arent, but lots have kids, and those kids are not entitled to spend their lives abused by the abusers who created them. They have every right to create their own life of happiness, joy and abundance as everyone else and not be definined by birth of circumstance. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:53:07
Jeez, thanks! And you know, I even took that into account, but unfortunately when I went to the only seller that was even within a REASONABLE range of purchase (around 950/bitcoin) he had all this criteria for purchase that I couldn't meet (US address, verified this, verified that...) 
It's so frustrating, I have money, and I'm in the US, in Orange County, but I can't buy a bitcoin for the life of me.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:48:41
There were people selling bitcoins for 1700$?! And the cheapest was like 950$ 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:20:50
That sounds terrible and I will keep that story in mind in my future transactions. PS could you tell me how I go about accepting that tip you sent me? I have a wallet but I don't know how to accept it, shamefully
