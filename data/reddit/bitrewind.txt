Hey Raguto, 
Thanks for the question. I wrote a belated explanation in this post (sorry for the time I took to type it up). 
Here's how it works:
1. You get an insurance for the BTC you want to protect against a price drop. Specify how much you BTC you want to insure and until what date.
2. When the price drops below your insured price (e.g. $9000) at the policy expiration, you get the difference auto-deposited to BTC wallet. 
I'm considering paying out in cash. It can be either USD, Tether, Euro, or any currency.
Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.

Hi I'm launching a new service called BitRewind and wanted to ask for your feedback. In short, BitRewind offers a price protection for your Bitcoin.
Currently, 1 BTC is traded at $9000. I can give you a protection against a possible price drop.
**How It Works**
1. Let's say you decide to buy protection so that if your BTC drops below $9000, you're protected. 
2. If BTC drops to $7000, you get $9000 - $7000 = $2000 back. Therefore, you still have your $9000.
**Price (to insure until the end of this week)**
- To protect at $7000: $84
- To protect at $8000: $102
- To protect at $9000: $580
- Minimum amount: 0.1 BTC
- You can get paid in BTC, USD, Tether, Euro, or any local currency.
Let me know what you think.

The Merkle article cherry picks Thiel's quote. Here's what the original CNBC article says:






Thiel is an early-stage VC, and by nature, he spreads his money around, investing a little bit in each one of them. So, if you want to emulate his investing style, put only a little bit of money in Bitcoin.

Shorting is riskier than puts and has unlimited downside. It's generally considered undisciplined. That's why shorting is illegal in IRA accounts while long put is legal.
This is also why Ackman had stopped shorting Herbalife and switched to put late last year.
