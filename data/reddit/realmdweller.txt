Hopefully everyone who's tired of watching the elephant and jackass parties chip away at our constitution.

Yeah, wish i had gotten in in 09 when i first heard of it. Just ordered a GPU to mine litecoins and swap, but paypal screwed me into waiting an extra week for an express shipment. Just frustrated because Walmart, Albertsons and 711 are the only places that i can cash in from here. Each are a fare drive away, 711 being only one open 24 hours. Just made several trips to there trying to figure out why i was unable to buy in via bitinstant/zipzap, but turns out its due to their ATM systems updating, which is taking way longer than the hour they claimed... So, I give up for the night. Maybe I'll try my luck with Albertsons tomorrow.

Heck, I could use a boost like that to help build my first mining rig O.o

Still just shy of $139 on BCT-e, which is still pretty impressive when compared to its value just a few weeks ago... Just saying.

I had looked, but everyone listed for me was asking at least 150%, most more than 200% of the current value at that time.

Wewt!, hopefully it helps finally put someone in office that's worth half a shit!!!

I heard of bitcoin first in 2009 and didn't give it a second thought. I saw this happening and decided to start investing in mining (litecoin to convert to bct for now since i can't afford an ASIC yet). I'm glad the bubble poped sooner than later. To me it means another chance to get in the game. Regardless of exchange rate, it still means extra income once my mining rig amortizes it's self. People just need to be smarter about their investments and i think this was a good learning experience for fanatic investers and observers alike.

It'll bounce back :)... also, there's a startup working to help stabilize exchange rates, which will hopefully help boost confidence again.

Thanks! I'll look into it when I'm rested again.
