To be fair, it's not really their responsibility to provide stable water supply infrastructure to large populations.

You've convinced me. I just tapped out based on your super mega awesome logix.

Actually, if you look closely at the repayment schedule, it was printed on the 18th of December, 2017. Doesn't get much worse than that.

Whilst the article doesn't mention a date he bought in, I doubt it's recent. I'm guessing he bought close to the ATH - somewhere on that massive upswing anyway.

Life is gamble...

Thanks, I appreciate your kind sentiments.

Statistics demonstrate that anyone who finishes a sentence with "Lol" is typically on minimum wage but keep those jokes coming, it's entertaining.

Thanks mate! $10K will buy a nice holiday somewhere at least :)

True, high risk but I guess you've gotta put your balls on the line sometimes and go with your gut. It's worked for me in the past.

Retarded spastic here. I bought 3.2BTC today.

Could be but Dr. Emmett Brown's been in a mammoth K-hole for the past 6 months and his work on the time machine has been less than impressive to say the least.

Being told you're dumb by someone who can't differentiate between your and you're. Oh, the irony. I'm still seeing sizeable yields off my previous buy-ins at ~$500, $1500 so I'm somewhat content but thanks for the sage advice.

The other issue was that by turning, the iceberg ripped through multiple bulkheads on the side of the ship instead of potentially damaging only one at the front.

Yep. The shorts are being liquidated via margin calls.

As BTC hits $8K, I thought I'd revisit a thread I created a month ago - there were quite a few naysayers confidently telling me I'd lose all my money at $6K :) 
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:23:24
Thanks mate. I'm definitely not celebrating at this point but it's good to see some elongated periods of green :)
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:14:11
Care to adjust your response now?
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:05:47
7344 and rising. Looks like the bots have gone into overdrive!
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:13:28
Who knows in this current market. It looks like it's being driven by bots with the vertical ups and downs. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:29:16
 blowing up...
 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:34:18
Major carnage! ��
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:16:05
Looks like you'll be waiting a little longer for me to lose my investment :)
