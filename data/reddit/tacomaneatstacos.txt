This is why I hate bitcoin. Transaction time is way too slow. I'm stuck using bitcoin to do alt coin trading when its not available on shapeshift.

That’s cool. I haven’t done the math to see if it’s true though.
I recently took a trip to Vietnam. All their money is in the form of bills and most places only accept cash. The smallest bill is 1000 VND which is pretty much worthless since it can’t buy anything alone, so you use it as tipping money. 1 USD = nearly 23k VND. You can buy dinner on the street for 23k VND.

If coinbase is confusing BTC isn't for you or your trying to scam someone.

This is why I like Monero. It’s only my business to know how much is in my wallet.  The masses have not caught on yet.

Mail me a $100 bill and I’ll send you a bitcoin

Not if it was USDT. 
Question though. If you sell for USD but never withdraw from exchange do you still pay taxes or only after you withdraw?
