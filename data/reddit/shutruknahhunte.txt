Wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:27
Oh I know. Could buy at gas stations and such. But I’m saying on Coinbase itself 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:45:40
It already is. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:06
Bitcoin futures. Wall Street will attempt to short it 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:09:41
Oh wait buying. Nah idk. I misread as just sending. No idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:46
DM me or someone more intelligent. Be calm. Be smart. Breathe. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:53:33
Where do y’all get those 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:08:58
No one actually knows. But if a crash is coming, its in a few weeks. Futures will bet against bitcoin in an effort to instigate a crash. Force the number down, but big, shoot it up. 
So force from $13k to $7k then shoot it to $25k. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:01:14
Fuck faucets 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:10
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:09
What do you think they’re doing now? Making themselves whales. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:07
TRUE 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:06:34
Insider trading. It’s illegal 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:24:33
 I have like... $5 in bitcoin. If that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:56
9 is mine. I put in at 10.5k and will only lose that much. At 9 I pull out and of it gets back to 10k I go back in. If not, I go in at the first uptick. Wherever it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:21:16
New to board. Whale? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:21:52
I’m in law school. Keep in contact and I’d be down to go after them on slander/libel claims. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:11
Sorry yeah. So bitcoin futures will open soon. Essentially a stock group to bet for or against something. The current belief is they will bet AGAINST bitcoin. Causing it to drop. 
Most likely to drive the price down so Wall Street can get in for cheaper prices. 
The best way to work against something is to get in, support it, then drop. Like if someone bought $200k then sells like 2 days later. Keep it bouncing and erratic. 
So they make it look like a mess, bet against, plunge the price, get in low, and drive it back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:02:53
It’s been that steady? Damn 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:12:16
Ouch 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:20:07
I’ll PayPal ya $85 for the codes. That’s pretty much the same as what most exchanges will do anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:28
LOVE ME DAMNIT 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:36:09
They’re updating right now 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:08:28
cad? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:22:03
Causation would be payment by the employer, damages would be to all holders. If you post something on NYT saying Disney stock is near worthless, sell sell sell, causing the actual amount to drop.... well 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:41:38
..... I was not aware of this. Fuck I’m still so new. 
Thank you based Darrel 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:54:04
Wait just looked into it, I also want into AltCoins, and seems like GDAX only has the main 3
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:45:06
It’s artificial. Wall Street is building it up to crash. That’s my view at least 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:43:00
I love you. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:59:32
Wait for the correction then do it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:47
It’s artificial. Wall Street is poking its dick in 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:20:27
Oh fuck yeah. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:12:13
Oh shit you’re right. Intentional deception to cause harm in written or verbal media ISNT slanderous or libelous. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:05:36
I’m high balling at 8k. They’re pushing it down. Not up. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:17
Bitcoin futures 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:15:42
Well shit. I need friends in China and India then. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:33:22
$105,000,000 for 2 pizzas.

Oh wow. Socialized crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:46
Mate I had the same idea an hour ago hahah 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:35:19
By Satoshi, I would only buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:04
Same here, same here. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:33:02
Yes. You have a very short window. Yahoo stocks just endorsed it. NASDAQ is coming into the market in under 6 months. It will most likely stabilize at 20k for a bit. 
So start small and get in. It’s gonna be a wild ride 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:08:05
Extremely 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:52
Ah haha. Yeah imma hold onto it for a bit 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:27
Preev registering at 10010 again
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:04:05
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:37
Wouldn’t doubt it.... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:50:34
What 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:58:12
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:44:05
It hit 11.5 dude
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:41
Lol ye 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:54:23
What? I was saying won’t NASDAQ buying in make the price go up? It was a question 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:04:14
I use PayPal so I can cancel if I have regrets. Problem is finding when it goes through PayPal 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:21:58
I remember it breaking $100 being HUGE 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:45:31
So buy with the burst?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:00:41
Hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:45
Now this is podracing
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:59:59
I use coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:03
I’ve had the same problem. Makes me ehhh about using it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:40
Hold then? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:53:44
Big money? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:23
Stabilize but it will shoot up. It’s real, big money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:35:26
Sketch 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:13:57
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:40
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:27:05
I’m guessing stabilization at $20k solid. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:09
Thank you. I almost just sold. Guess it’s “run on the bank” mentality. Hold hold hold 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:33:32
It’s insane and great 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:02:16
I keep it there. But may get a wallet soon 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:04:57
Yeah. If you have any ill buy it off ya. I won’t buy high but I’ll save you from total loss 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:11:53
you can cancel a PayPal order for anything. It's paypal. 
So then it just doesn't go through. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:31:30
NASDAQ went public about BTC futures today when it hit above $10k solidly. 
My guess is they want to assure a doubling then stabilizing it there. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:41:01
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:24
Damn you, sir. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:10:00
I had the same sort of thing. But was a hard wallet. I had a hard drive that I restored to restore the wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:30:20
Ouch. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:28:19
Give them to me and I’ll give ya like... $10 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:40:47
Won’t this shoot it up 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:32:37
So hold off for the burst? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:08
But like. 9,700.....
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:44:27
Hahah I’ve watched since 2013. I just always expect drops over growth 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:20:16
It will shoot everything up. When they open up in March or so, 11k will seem low. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:02:38
Jesus. Fuckin. What a great tip 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:24:25
Found Elon’s account 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:01
I’m unsurprised. I believe it’s intentional. Prevent runs on the bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:15
12 I think. The next really insane ATH will be with NASDAQ
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:50:27
So they patented the name. Nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:20
Same dude. Same 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:32:10
Not famous. But not “some random really really smart person” ya know? 
Someone wealthy, smart, good at predicting tech futures 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:26:28
Bezos is only wealthy through government contracts and deals. Without the feds he wouldn’t be more than a book salesman. 
Musk’s Tesla project has government backing. PayPal didn’t. SpaceX marginally because NASA isn’t doing much more space. 
Elon is more likely 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:07:02
Shit son. How do i sell on an Indian exchange? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:42
