It's a risky strategy to use anything less than discretionary finances however if more and more people leverage their savings and wages in BTC, then it should drive up more spending options and controls. BTC could offer more than just a refuge or safehaven for folks in unstable economies.

It didn't give me a clear opt-out option either

It won't be an easy ride. Already dark forces are assembling against it.

Cool. Where can I invest a few spare BTC into bona fide Venezuelan BTC mining ops?

Good stuff. I have been waiting for something like this for a while. 
I just signed up. Will keep an eye on how the site and service develops over time.

If my bitcoins stay in my wallet and I keep my host environment secure and uptodate patchwise, I'm safe from the type of attacks used on bitcoinia, right?

I think I would like the idea of value of money being somewhat pegged to mass/energy.

Just think of all the poor Bitcoinica sys admins. Capped bonuses this year and all.

Shoot, I missed the boat. How about I jump onto one of the newer competing technologies like, say, litecoin?

I'd advise him to drop a progress update everyday until the problems are solved. It'll take some of the heat out of the current situation.
