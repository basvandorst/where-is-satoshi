Did he really buy a ferrari with bitcoin?

They dont want to open to prevent people from withdrawing BTC. 
I called their customer service regarding my BTC withdrawal. The gentlemen on the line mentioned they simply dont have enough BTC due to all the withdrawals. Luckily, I got my BTC out a few hours ago.

No. I am just trying to warn others. I also would not have posted this until I got my money out first.
