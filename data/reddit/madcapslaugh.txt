Do not share any information with people on the internet. They will steal your money. I have a similar set up with instructions for my wife in the case I die suddenly. 
I am sorry for your loss

Hold means don’t try and time the market via day trading to increase your position. If you heave reaches your magic number where you are ready to cash out or realize some gains, that’s fine. Go for it

There can never be more than 21 million people that own more than one bitcoin. Divisibility plays no role in this.

It will be anchored to one currency. In many places this is the case. In Jerusalem Israel rent will often be listed on USD but you pay in shekels

A break off group owns the domain bitcoin.com
They have a knock off coin called bitcoin cash. 
They wanted to change how mining works but were in the minority’s opinion so they split and made a different coin. 
This is fine and many times has happened before. What is not cool is they try and trick people into thinking the coins they sell are the original bitcoin. 
You are looking for bitcoin.org

good point. although i have met a number of people that got a windfall of over a million, it tends to melt like ice

they could be forced to, or chose to freeze your coins. all you have from them is an IOU

Most people call the new coin “Bcash” it’s accrual a good coin , but the guy behind it wants it to be called “bitcoin cash” so he can trick people. Not cool.

It’s easier to fake a holographic tape than a counterfeit IC. 
Any idea how the software check via the Python script works

Why is this different than any other taxes. You pay the police half so that a worse thief does not steal the whole
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:52:28
it seems from these threads that is not the case

here is the recommended way to verify that the ledger is legit, no mention of a tamper seal

yeah they pass it out when you get to the exchange floor
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:19:14
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:15:20
I don’t think the ledger has holograms. But you can scan the firmware and pop it open to confirm the hardware has not been tampered with

here is the card that is included in the box which explains why they put no sticker on it

For about $50k you could build your own Facebook. Does that mean Facebook is a bubble?

I’m adding evidence to give your comment more merit. Not intending to disagree with your comment. Sorry if that’s not clear. Making a business copy is easy but it does not create the underlying value.

I got a job and took the Money to an exchange and bought bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:45:35
That and where I would store the paper wallet so I could discover it when I get back and not cause a paradox
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:07:39

My wife considers all the money I put into a Bitcoin as money that we threw away and doesn't really have value even though it's gone up because she believes I will never ever sell it and therefore it will never return back as usable income to our family.

The more you invest, the more you make when it goes up. If the price doubled, you sell for double the amount you bought
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:36:47
Their website explains what to do. There is a python script to check the firmware is legit. Then you pop the back off with your fingernail and check the micro controller is original and no extra flash storage or ram was installed. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:47:06
but its not the same private key or seed, right

Is it foolish to also have a wallet on my iPhone and use the ledger as a backup? If it's not foolish are there iPhone app wallets that are recommended and compatible?

In the competitive space of the co-working Industry things like thought leadership and forward-thinking and Frontier have value in of themselves. I am looking for ways to articulate why it is in their interest to position themselves as a fundamental part of the blockchain and what this means for the future of currency

Do not use coinbase to store your bitcoin. They are nothing more than an IOU. If you don’t own your private keys, you don’t own bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:01:52
I thought that's what's the name of the source code I referred to above. If that's not correct I apologize.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:36:00
that was the post that lead me to write here. i was unable to understand when it was decided to not include check points, which is the question i was asking above
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:00:46
What is wrong with this post? I think it's a good thing to remove checkpoints. Running your own full node is essential to decentralization. And small blocks make that possible. I don't want to depend on some developer to tell me what the correct chain is. I researched the topic and had trouble finding the history.
