after the first year, he explicitly seeked new recruits from newbie sections, and gained trust giving away under penny amounts in forum 'givaways' and coaxed them over to IRC. he gained the trust of 'noobs' who didnt know his past and convinced them that he was repaying people. it would have been harder to achieve this for that long if he continued asking established members of bitcoin, so he systematically sought out fresh people with no rep as his recruits in stage 2 knowing that they knew nothing about the stage 1 established loanee's being out of pocket. and also these stage 2 people had no rep to inform stage 3 recruits, knowing he could call stage 1&amp;2 people trolls. whilst also controlling his IRC channel to ban stage 2 people once he scammed them, to ensure none of the stage 1&amp;2 people could contact stage 3 people. then simply rinse and repeat the process more stages

OP was not the hacker of BTC-E.
OP is not french.
OP got scammed by Supa due to a loan, not due to any hacking partnership.now here is the truth about BTC-E. They were hacked yes, but supa wanted to pretend he was an elite hacker by saying it was himself. BTC-E has confirmed it was not supa. 
P.S try to stick with facts when trying to make someone look bad..
Supa is scum, but atleast the OP is only showing factual info about his Scum-buggery

he asks for microloans from fresh recruits and either makes profit gambling/trading or using other loanee's funds to give returns to fresh recruits, to tempt them to lend more and become established loanee's.. eventually excuses involving delays occur whre he does not repay loanee's. where he is then still playing with funds and using those funds as the interest bonus to recruit a new batch of fresh investors.
