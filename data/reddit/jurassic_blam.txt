No my point is that you're saying bitcoin has been outperforming 401ks for years when it most definitely hasn't: 2014 and 2015 saw massive losses - while the stock market performed well.

I wish Libertarian Parties fought for civil liberties and not just abolition of taxes, deregulation and free market dick sucking. I'd join the Civil Libertarian party. 
"Libertarians" don't seem to have a very informed view of the complexities of the real world. They seem good at pointing out problems but not the solutions. Their solutions are generally in the form of non-solutions and dyke-fingering. When pressed for any details it's all hand-waving; the free market will figure it out!

I'm not saying that at all. I'm just asking why, if there is so much evidence of her guilt and the ability and willingness by the administration to prosecute her, it hasn't happened?
What crimes is Sessions prosecuting that is taking up so much of his time? [I distinctly remember Trump saying he'd assign a special prosecutor]( Why hasn't he? He's the president. He has the entire power of the government behind him.
The answer is fucking obvious for anyone with a brain: there is in fact no evidence to prosecute, let alone convict and it was all rightwing Fox News propaganda. And you fucking fell for it, like a rube.

A lot of libertarians want all drugs legalized, which is obviously dumb. 
Should we review our current drug policy and decide what's really dangerous? Absolutely. Should we lock people up for putting things in their body? Debatable, but I say no. Should we let anyone have any amount of access to any substance they want, with no oversight as to who made it, when and where? Fuck no.
A lot of libertarians think pollution has a free-market solution, which again is dumb."Roll back EPA regulations! We need the freedom to pollute so we can make Jobs™!"  We tried the free market and fucked up our rivers and air.
Good taxes? I think progressive tax rates are a good idea because the rich 1) benefit the most from our government and 2) i think fundamentally unchecked wealth inequality leads to less freedom in society.
Libertarians often think flat taxes or, in more idiotic circles, no taxes would be best.

So I'll ask you again: why hasn't she been convicted by Trump's own AG? He said he would. Apparently, according to you, there is enough evidence to prosecute and convict. It's all "proven". Trump's popularity is in the pits. Wouldn't this be a slam dunk?

Do you honestly think the success of developed countries is despite their governments, not because of them?
Yes, their are failed nation states with totalitarian governments (e.g. North Korea, Venezuela) but that is an indictment of *those* particular failed governments, not concept of government  itself.

Using currency and paying taxes aren't really related. You're not taxed *because* you transact in dollars. 
In fact, the opposite. Transacting in dollars is the only way you aren't taxed. If you pay for something in bitcoin, if the value of that bitcoin has increased since you bought it you owe taxes on it. Since the dollar can't move relative to itself you don't have to calculate taxes on every transaction.
Of course there is sales tax but that would be included regardless of the currency you use.

The language will change when it is needed.
For example, I'm a mechanical engineer who works on small products. I deal in millimeters because it makes the numbers easier. Some MEs work on oil rigs and deal in meters. Aerospace engineers work in kilometers.
It will change in specific contexts, if it needs to. There's no need to push for it. If it's useful to use a different denomination it will happen naturally.

I think you are the one who is missing the point.
Yes, 1 bitcoin is an arbitrary division, but there are still a finite amount of divisions, because bitcoin is a finite quantity.
Think of it like oil. We talk about the price of oil in barrels - only so many barrels are produced every day. You can't magically say "guys! barrels are arbitrary! we shouldn't care about the price of a barrel! you don't have to buy a whole barrel! you can buy a gallon of gasoline! or a cup!"
....ok yeah. that's true. But we've agreed to talk about oil in terms of barrels because we're not literally talking about barrels. We're talking about the commodity and the entire quantity of that commodity. Not one specific barrel.

I wasn't literally talking about using oil to produce energy to mine Bitcoin, you dolt. 
My point was that nobody does things at home that industry can do 1000 times better. If they do, they do it at a comparative loss. 
You shop at the supermarket for food because farmers produce quantitatively and qualitatively better food than you ever could in your backyard. 
You don't drill for oil because it is prohibitively expensive and complicated. 
Just like mining in your house - even if you're off he grid - it's cheaper to simply buy Bitcoin. Just like you can spend 40 cents on a tomato at the store vs build a garden in your backyard for $100, water the plant every day and maybe produce a few dozen tomatoes. 
Idealists of course will mine Bitcoin at a loss. Sounds like you would. Just like idealists in suburbia make gardens and pretend they're feeding themselves and not ....doing something with shekels or slaves or something.

Increasing difficulty = increasing hashrate = increasing power.
It's as simple as that.


transactions/second has nothing to do with hashing power. Its something fundamental to the code of the network.
I'm going to stop right here. It's fairly clear you don't actually understand the fundamentals of bitcoin or energy and power and general physics concepts.

Yeah because gold is a physical object so the analogy is irrelevant. It takes no special room to store bitcoin. The amount you can withdraw from a hypothetical bitcoin account won't be limited to the size of your truck.
The point is you can buy and sell gold at a bank, even if you don't have the gold in your hand. Which is what plenty of people might want to do with bitcoin.

That's not at all analogous. My argument is not that bitcoin's transactions are too slow or something.
My point is that banks and third party lenders will most likely be necessary in the future and bitcoin will not render them useless - in fact, banks and professional security service may be more important than ever.
If you disagree, can you please take a picture of all the cash you store under your mattress?
Please. Before you go on about anything, do you think loans and credit will be necessary in the future? If so, who will be loaning money and extending credit? If not, how will capital remain liquid?

Man. Where to start?


Those industries account for like 10,000 times the value of bitcoin. Of course they use more. They don't use more *per value transacted.*
That's like saying "my Ford F-150 uses way less fuel than a Boeing 747". Yeah, no shit. But the 747  gets way more fuel per passenger-mile.  


No. It won't. The way the network works it will continue to use more and more energy to transact the same amount of bitcoins. It is inherent to the nature of the difficulty adjustments.  


It's not an article. It's a video. Did you even watch it?

ah. so. you don't know. 
i have an idea:
What if someone creates this company that gives people bitcoin if they promise to pay it back. If they pay them back on time then the company gives them a good reputation and they'll give them more money in the future - like yelp, or something.
but if they don't give back the bitcoin they get a bad reputation and they can't get bitcoin in the future :(
"ok, but what about all that money they lost to that person? How will they get that money back?"
We'll they could socialize the loss. They could give people bitcoin and make them pay back a little more than they give out. 
"Ok, but how do they make money?" 
hmmm. well they could charge a little more bitcoin on top of the amount.
"ok, but where do they get all this money from?"
hmmmm well, they could have some investors give them some money to start and pay them back with their profits!
"wow. that's a good idea. want to start that company?"
no. banks are a terrible idea.

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:16:29
I think that analogy falls apart in that you can't separate a wallet from the Bitcoin. They can't really be in two separate places - unlike the key and the treasure chest. It would be like having the key to hat chest tied to the chest itself.

That's philosophically debatable.
If the only way to access or move the bitcoins are using that wallet then you could argue they are "stored" there. If you lost that wallet you lose the bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:16:36
it's an analogy.
i can call the 'velocity' the 'supply of coins' if i want. it's just a number. it doesn't change the math in any way.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:38:10
yeah ok. assuming there is no friction.
edit: as another user pointed out: lost coins would be analogous to friction. actually not a constant friction that would slow it down to zero. more like quantized losses. like bugs hitting the windshield slowing the car down a little bit each time.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:45:23
that's a whitewash of history. it largely was. does the postal service still exist? yes.
do they send as many letters as they used to? not even close. they downsized like 90%
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:53:24
uhhhh what? no.
the velocity (supply of coins) is not going to zero. The acceleration (coins mined/minute) is going to zero.
The velocity (supply of coins) will reach a certain finite number and never increase or decrease.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:56:56
I assume you mean the word "own" everywhere, right? Not being a dick - "owe" kind of makes sense if you think of money as debt...
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:59:26
Lost coins would be analogous to friction. They would slow the speed of the car. Every lost coin would be like a bug hitting the windshield, slowing the car down.

You wouldn't trust pseudoanonymous accounts on reddit? wow. what a concept.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:27:29
Yes that's my point.
A piece of paper carrying the password to your bank account is not the same as a paper bitcoin wallet.
If you lose the bank password the bank still has your money. You can just go to the bank and retrieve your funds once you prove who you are. A checkbook isn't analogous to a bitcoin wallet either. A check is just a piece of paper that tells one bank to move funds to another bank. It's not money.
If you lose your wallet keys the bitcoin are gone. Forever.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:49:10
It's not wrong, you just don't understand it.
Bitcoin's speed (amount of coins) started at 0.
Bitcoin's acceleration (amount of coins produced/minute) started at 50/10mins and has been decreasing ever since.
Bitcoins supply has always been increasing and will continue to increase - approaching a finite supply
The amount the supply is increasing is slowing, but the supply is still increasing.
Just like you can keep going faster and faster in a car but still be letting off the gas.
Braking would be analogous to the supply decreasing, which isn't happening.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:50:30
what's the functional difference?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:00:03
oh look. someone else making a different analogy and thinking I'm wrong instead of just saying "yeah...that's another way to express the exact same thing...."


Not in my analogy. From the moment the genesis block was mined the supply of coins was zero. Then 50. Then 100. Then 150. See? The supply (speed) is increasing. The car is *accelerating*


Yep. In my analogy this would be like the driver slowly taking his foot off the gas. The car is still being pushed forward, ever increasing in speed. It's just not going faster *as fast*


lolololol yeah. I guess those 4 years of college engineering calculus made me bad at it....


I think anyone with an actual firm grasp of calculus would realize the math is the same and not argue the point. Calling the supply velocity or acceleration doesn't really matter. It's simply a different way to describe the same situation. I'd argue that if you can't shift your perspective that it is you who doesn't understand the material well.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:35:01
no. 
letting off the gas doesn't slow your car down.
applying the brake does.
they are indeed different.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:38:50
the idea that the car isn't starting at the beginning and it slowly accelerates. i find that analogy appealing.
His analogy would mean the car is moving at the start and the brake is just applied and the car eventually stops.
Regardless, he came out swinging with "WRONG!!" which it most definitely isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:51:47
Say you had a paper wallet with bitcoin in it.
The only way to access the bitcoin stored on it is using that paper wallet.
If it gets destroyed, the bitcoin is essentially gone.

....did you [google it?]( There are literally hundreds of charities, often dozen or so in each city, providing this service.


Yeah but you're paying for the gas, labor, overhead etc, yourself. It's not free to do what you're doing; you're simply eating that cost yourself. Yes, 100% of *donations* go to paying for food, but there are additional costs you're ignoring.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:33:58
...........then it worries me that you can't understand that we're talking about the same thing....and that the math is the same. it's just a different starting analogy.

I mean that in the example of a single copy of a bitcoin paper wallet there is no real distinction between the wallet and the bitcoin stored "within" it.
One is valueless without the other.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:43:02
that's actually a way more insane number.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:59:55


In this hypothetical, for the purposes of this conversation we're assuming you're carrying the single copy of a paper wallet that is "storing" the bitcoin.
And that's the crux of the problem. If you hold the single copy of a wallet is there any distinction between the wallet keys and the bitcoin it protects? I posit no.
Why? Because if they were to take your single copy of the wallet they've essentially taken your bitcoins, because you no longer have access to them.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:19:40
ok. good to know I'm not having a conversation.

@_date: 2017-11-02 17:31:05

@_date: 2017-11-03 14:54:51
Fucking with Customs and Border Protection is a really dumb thing to do...
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:43:35

Did I make any mathematical errors? Was it internally consistent? Was it you who failed to recognize I just used a different starting point than you're used to?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:34:26
no. taking your foot off the gas is not the same thing as braking.
speed = supply
acceleration = rate of change of supply
amount you're pushing on the gas = rate of change of rate of change of supply.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:04:29
dude, units don't matter because it's an analogy. they don't have to line up unit-for-unit.
what if blocks weren't mined in units of time but number of transactions. like 10 bitcoins were mined every 2500 transactions.
Then what would you do?
The analogy doesn't have to be unit-for-unit consistent. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:48:10
If you have the only copy of the keys it means literally no one else can move the coins. They're essentially locked in that piece of paper.
No one can move the bitcoin without *that* piece of paper. For all intents and purposes that piece of paper *is* the bitcoin. 
You can say they're "on the blockchain" but who cares? My home address is on google maps but no one can buy or sell my house without my permission.
Here's a thought experiment: if they took that piece of paper away from you, would you say "doesn't matter - the bitcoins are on the blockchain!".
No. You wouldn't. Why? Because the keys *are* your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:27:30

[I see nothing on here that would describe bitcoin ](
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:14:21
bahahah fuck me. 
ok. do you realize you're making a completely different analogy? and that in fact it's just a different level derivative. the math is the exact same thing, you tool.
me: 
bitcoin's supply = velocity
bitcoin's block reward = acceleration
rate of change of block reward = amount foot is on the gas
you: 
bitcoin's supply = total distance traveled
bitcoin's block reward = velocity
rate of change of block reward = acceleration
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:40:21
Have you ever heard of an analogy in your life?
Your car slows down because of friction and drag, not because your foot isn't on the gas. Obviously I didn't include those in the analogy.

dollars have a finite supply currently too. both supplies of bitcoin and dollars are increasing currently.
imagine two cars: one called bitcoin and one called dollars.
they're both going a certain *finite* speed.
the drivers both have their foot on the gas and they're both accelerating increasing their *finite speed*
however the driver of the bitcoin car is reducing how much his foot is on the gas and eventually will stop accelerating, reaching a certain *finite* speed
the driver of the dollar car may never take his foot off the gas resulting in an infinitely high, speed.

what is the **functional difference** between your wallet and your bitcoin if you only have one copy of the keys?

if two things are functionally useless without the other, why make the distinction between them?

My point is "the system will collapse" has been said over and over again through the decades, yet...here we are. Doing arguably better than ever.

It's a huge decentralization of the production of ice.
It's not a huge decentralization of wealth. Like you correctly point out it devastated the ice farming industry.
But a whole new, far more profitable industry arose: the refrigerator making industry.
Now there are capitalists investing in machinery, fuel, raw materials to produce these machines. The same amount of labor (a large production cost) can produce machines that replace thousands of ice farmers. These profits go straight to the owners and investors. Not the displaced ice farmers.
Again. This tech, while improving the lives of basically everyone on the planet, concentrates wealth into the hands of the owners.
People keep getting hung up on the fact that technology makes life better. I'm not denying that. I'm saying it makes life better for people disproportionately. Those that benefit the most are already at the top. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:57:36
How about this: 
do you agree 1) there is a wealth inequality 2) that wealth inequality is getting larger?
I'll save you the trouble: both those things are true.
Now ask yourself why? What causes wealth inequality? Well, to start taxes. That's obviously a big one and I am by no means ignoring it.
But the second is capital. The wealthy have capital a.k.a the means of production. What exactly is the means of production? **TECHNOLOGY**.
Ok i am going to say this one more fucking time: Standard of living (cheap food, goods, services) and wealth inequality are unrelated. 
You can and do have rising wealth inequality and rising standard of living (China). You can also have rising WI and declining SOL (North Korea) . And you can have declining WI and declining SOL (...Somalia maybe?)
THEY ARE UNRELATED.
 You don't need to keep telling me how great technology makes the world. Cheap shit! Yay! I know this.
The point is that technology helps the wealthy proportionately more than the poor, because it is capital. No amount of refrigerators making you ice will offset the gains from owning the factories producing the refrigerators. 
If you doubt any of this, go take a college economics course.

I feel like I'm doing a fine job explaining. People are just putting words in my mouth and arguing against something I'm not even saying. For example, you.


I've had a pretty coherent argument: Technology, unchecked, increases wealth inequality. To those that shrug this off, I say that wealth inequality is bad for society.
If you made the logical jump that technology is bad because wealth inequality is bad, that's not my fault. That's on you. I never said that.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:32:59


Do you see that big box in your kitchen? You know how it produces really cold solid water? Notice how you're not digging up ice from frozen lakes? That's how I know. More profitable businesses succeed. Less profitable ones die because they cannot compete. Simple as that. If you disagree, I suggest you go dig up some ice in the winter, save it in a barn during the summer and sell it. See how profitable it is and report back.
Jesus. I'm not talking  about the decentralization of ice production. I have covered that.
And jesus. "Everyone was wealthier" doesn't mean that wealth inequality decreased. Why can't you guys understand that?


WEALTH. WEALTH!! WEALTH1!!!!!!!!! Yes the ownership of the means of producing ICE was in the hands of one company. Wealth was not.

Actually I'm having a hard time thinking of one example, because literally all technology, like I've said, contributes to centralization of wealth.
But one basic, high school level example? The steam engine. 
The steam engine converts energy to work. A steam engine can do the work of 100 men. But steam engines are expensive so you need money to build them. Who has money? *The already-wealthy.* Who makes money from replacing workers with the steam engine? **The already wealthy.** Who is displaced from their job, suppressing wages? The workers/poor.
Now apply this idea to microprocessors. Or the telephone. Or the light bulb. Or the tractor. Literally everything. New technology is *always* created to make a process faster, cheaper or more efficient. Why? To increase the profits of the owners of that technology
I mean, this is like basic capitalism 101. Do people really reject the idea that technology has made rich people richer?


That is totally irrelevant. As i have said a dozen times, increased standard of living (cheap, available ice) has absolutely nothing to do with wealth inequality (the difference between how much rich and poor people own). Do you understand that? Honestly, I'm asking if you understand the difference between wealth inequality and standard of living.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:16:53
.......You think auto workers who were fired because they were replaced by robots went to go get higher paying jobs? You think a massive glut of unemployed people raised wages because they all went to go get robot designing jobs? 
You think factory owners invested in robots because they wanted to make less money, not more?
How's Detroit doing these days, with all those great new jobs?
Producing cheaper products does not spread wealth. It may increase total wealth, but that's not what we're talking about. Producing cheaper products enriches the owners of the capital (technology) used to create those cheaper products.
Furthermore, buying a cheap product doesn't make you wealthier. If you buy a $200 TV, you're not $200 wealthier. It just means you have a $200 TV and 200 fewer dollars. 
Think about this: do you think the gap in wealth between the owners of Walmart (The Walton family) and the people who shop at Walmart (buying all those lovely, cheap, wealth spreading products) is getting smaller?
Hint: It isn't.

Do you dispute that Monero is now the preferred coin of drug buyers/sellers on the dark web? 
(For what it's worth, I could be wrong on this. I don't know this for a fact. I don't know the relative volumes that are transacted with bitcoin vs monero for illicit purposes.)
I'm saying for argument's sake, that more people exchange monero for drugs online. I then posit that bitcoin has been replaced by monero in that market. It doesn't matter that the majority of people purchase monero with bitcoin. It's entirely irrelevant - especially given that you don't *have* to buy it with bitcoin.
Monero has replaced bitcoin ins a certain market; in the same way that tablets haven't replaced all computers, but tablets have cornered the POS market.

Bitcoins, which are the unit of account of the bitcoin network, come from "miners". Miners, which are actually computers, race to solve math problems. Solving these math problems helps to secure the bitcoin network. 


They are created by the bitcoin software when miners secure the network, as explained briefly above. They are not tangible. Although you can save them on paper or metal. In a sense they can be tangible, in the same way that dollars can be tangible or electronic. The paper dollar is a representation of a value.


This is complicated and there is no real answer. You could say it becomes money when people trade goods and services for it.

@_date: 2017-09-18 16:52:11


What causes the cycles, then?
While I agree that violence has redistributed wealth in the past 
1) there is no promise that that will happen again, especially as so much wealth depends on peace - and how destructive our weapons are now.
2) That's not a counter to "technology creates a wealth gap", simply that the gap can be closed.


Rarely the case. Like I said, technology is a form of capital and you know who has capital? Already wealthy people. A few outliers get rich (Bill Gates, Steve jobs etc) but the people who were wealthy already, who had the money to invest in new tech become even wealthier. Do you think you or the Winklevoss twins have made more money off bitcoin? 
 And again, that says nothing about closing the wealth gap.


Very much agree. But who will be developing/owning AI? McDonald's workers? Or, indirectly, Warren Buffet and Bill Gates? 
I think it best to ignore general AI for the purposes of this conversation (only because it's such a curveball that we can't even fathom the changes it might cause) 
**Again: can anyone cite a technology that has closed the gap on wealth inequality?** I don't mean technology that helped people make money. I'm asking for a technology that closed the gap between those with money and those without it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:57:06

I don't even know where to begin with that....
So I'll just say this: as the code stands now, you can't divide Bitcoin infinitely. Hence the term satoshi. The smallest unit of account in the Bitcoin protocol. 
But you're missing the forest for the trees. If you have a gold bar and you cut it in half, you don't have twice as much gold or twice as much value. You have the same amount of gold. Dividing it infinitely while possible doesn't make more gold.

This...is dumb.
I see a lot of this kind of thing in the bitcoin community: creating false comparisons with the sole purpose of pumping bitcoin.
Bitcoin is technology - it is not a fundamental law of the universe.
As a technology, humans use it. Humans interact with it. If humans disappeared tomorrow, so would bitcoin (yeah yeah yeah it would all be on hard drives)
Just like any technology, governments can try to ban its use. And they may be successful. They can and *are* throwing road blocks in the way. This is a very serious problem and to brush it off the they're trying to ban mathematics is stupid. It's essentially putting your head in the sand.
I'm not saying they will be 100% successful, but they don't have to be. They only have to be partially successful. It's not all or nothing. They can easily make an example of a handful of high profile people - enough to scare the general population away - and they will have essentially banned it's use. You know, just like facebook, twitter etc.

Dividing something smaller and smaller doesn't make more of the original quantity. That 21 million is a hard limit. Dividing it into finitely many smaller quantities doesn't make more than 21 million.

There are plenty of legitimate uses for bitcoin. I trust readers can google it for themselves.


There are countries now that have collapsing governments but functioning internet. There are many reasons someone might want to store their wealth in a non-fiat currency, if only temporarily. Don't trust me? Go ask a Venezuelan. 


My understanding of the Fed, fiat and "stable" currencies has only grown as i learned about bitcoin. I don't think they're bad ideas but only when I understood them did I understand bitcoin


Bitcoin isn't necessarily an investment. And even if it was, how does it differ from stocks?

We can see where every bitcoin is sitting, but we have no idea if the keys to each wallet are in the possession of someone or lost.
If bitcoin are sitting in a lost wallet they are effectively destroyed and can no longer be bought or sold. They have reduced the supply and introduced uncertainty in the amount of bitcoin in *effective existence*.
The trouble is: we have no idea how many wallets are lost.
Here's a perfect and incredibly famous example: Satoshi Nakamoto. His wallet contains 1 million bitcoin. We don't know if he's alive or dead. If he is alive, we don't know if he has the keys to his wallet. If he's dead, we don't know if he gave them to someone.
**We have no idea how many bitcoins are in circulation. ~6% of all the bitcoins ever produced are a complete mystery.**
USA can claim as much gold as they want but there's no way to know how much gold is in the world with perfect certainty. Another example: i was cleaning out a desk i bought on craigslist, and i shit you not, there was a 1oz gold coin in the drawer. It was completely unknown, presumed lost. Until I found it. That day the gold supply gained some gold (that it had previously lost)

How did that one ice company closing close the wealth gap...? Surely it just moved the wealth to companies and individuals who owned the refrigeration companies. They didn't need to pay laborers to cut ice and thus make even more money producing ice automatically. 
Yes, I agree that it's a balancing act between inequality and total wealth. But striving for as much absolute wealth as possible is not ideal either. You can very easily imagine a situation where 99% of the world's wealth is owned by 500 people. Look at Saudi Arabia.

......Where have I said technology is bad? Please quote me. 
Large amounts of inequality IS bad for democracy. See all the examples around the world. Wealth inequality and political power of the average citizen are inversely correlated. Period.
My argument is that technology, unchecked, increases wealth inequality. I have asked for examples to disprove this idea, and I haven't received any.
Instead, everyone is dodging the idea because "well wealth inequality is totally cool because people aren't poor anymore"
And it should be obvious that that's a stupid thing to say...yet...people keep saying it. Including you. Here's why
1) There is no beneficial connection between wealth inequality and increased standard of living. Wealth inequality isn't some necessary evil to bring people out of the gutter. You can have a prosperous society that has a very small gap between rich and poor (see much of Europe, Canada, etc)
2) If the goal was to increase the general standard of living, increasing wealth inequality doesn't help move society toward that goal. Giving a poor person $10 and a wealthy person $10,000 makes everyone, on average wealthier, but the poor person could be 100 times wealthier ($1000) while the rich person could be barely 10% poorer ($9010). In both situations the general wealth increase is the same while the standard of living has been raised substantially (assuming personal wealth and SOL are associated)

I didn't ignore it - it's just not relevant to the conversation we were having. I don't fully even understand what you mean by "negative function". 
Clearly we both agree that less coins would make the price increase (supply and demand). And it looks like you're finally acknowledging that lost coins = less coins in circulation. Whether I think that's a good or bad thing depends entirely on my motivations. Am I holding? Am I trying to buy? Right now, I'm neutral. I'm holding but trying to buy more. Price increases help and hurt me. So you're question doesn't have an answer.
But the point was this: I was, rightly, explaining to you why there is no way to know how many coins are lost and thus an accurate count of total bitcoins in circulation is impossible and thus price discovery will always be very uncertain. This is the same with gold.

It basically already has. Monero is the coin of choice for black market stuff.

I mean you did a piss poor job of explaining anything. All you said was 3 letters. ICO.
Explain how a student gets a loan - having no money - without a bank.
Explain how a corporation that needs 50x times it's cash reserves will fund construction of a new factory if bitcoin (or whatever currency) only increases in value 1% per year?
Explain how you buy a car if you have no money in the bank because you live pay check-to-pay check.
Come on. Lay a smack down on me. You can figure it out.
Or you won't.

You can centralize wealth AND increase the total amount of wealth AND raise the wealth of the poor simultaneously. They aren't mutually exclusive. 
I have yet to hear someone propose a technology that didn't centralize wealth. Can you please propose one? I have proposed a theory, I can cite many technologies that have centralized wealth. Can you point to any that disprove my theory?

2) It's probably not fake news.

BAHAHAHAH SMACK DOWN?! dude. you're fucking delusional.
Funny thing about needing a loan - you tend not to have currency in the first place.
Students. You know.... people who don't have money - who take out loans to pay for college to get a job to GET MONEY.
And what, corporations are just supposed to wait until their currency deflates before they can do what they need to do?  They want to build a new factory to enter a new market before their competitors but they just have to sit on their dicks while their money (and everyone else's) increases in value?
Your car breaks down and you need a new one. You just have to sit around and hope you money is worth more tomorrow? And worth sufficiently more so that you can buy a car? Or you make an ICO for your car and hope people buy into it? For what return exactly?
Do you realize how stupid that all sounds And how the obvious answer to all these questions is....
People loaning money for interest. On demand. Instantly. BANKS. BANKS. CREDIT UNIONS. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
Spit out the r/bitcoin koolaid. Banks are here to stay because they provide actual services people actually need.

Bitcoin has taught me the value of patience in investing and the futility, thereof.
I bought my first bitcoin for $1100 in 2013. I kept buying all the way down to $400. Around then I stopped. I was in the red for years. I was so ashamed I had been duped by a pyramid scheme. I went from " i'm buying the dip!" to "i'm holding this bag while i make people rich. fuck this"
Honestly, I don't know why I didn't sell and take a loss. I wouldn't even say I had faith it would ever rebound. I had this weird masochistic desire to stay in, lose all my money as punishment. Kind of like parents washing their kids mouths out with soap.
I stuck it out, content that I had lost some money. It wasn't the end of the world. The stock market didn't do that well in that time either so I didn't feel like I was missing out too much.
Then the last year and a half happened. I was in the pits of despair and suddenly ejected into wealth. I basically doubled my net worth in the last year.
And yet.....I don't care. I kind of shrug off these giant gains. I know it's all illusory. I know it can drop by 80-90% in a matter of weeks. Or it could keep going up. 
But in the end, it really doesn't matter. Unless I spend it, they're just numbers on a screen. If I die tomorrow, I won't die wealthy; I'll just be dead.
I guess what I'm saying is be patient, but be patient with purpose. Make use of your gains if and when you can. Or else one day you'll be holding the bag or eventually be dead.

"no *true* scotsman puts sugar on his porridge"
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:24:16
No. You said "how many bitcoins there are" which is equivalent to "how many bitcoins have been mined". You're wrong to say "bitcoins are destroyed" when a wallet is lost. They're simply stuck in that wallet never to be spent again - but they're not gone and should still be considered in circulation. For the very fact that you can't tell if a coin is lost or simple being held. See Satoshi's stash. Are they in circulation or not? Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:16:54
I know. But that wasn't what was said.

How so? I sent my brother in law some coins a few weeks ago and it worked just fine. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:56:45
.....right. So because of that you have to assume if has been mined, it exists. Because it's the only assumption that is grounded in fact. All else is useless speculation. "In circulation" means absolutely nothing. "Mined" is the only metric you can know with any certainty. 
How many bitcoins are there = how many have been mined.

But the price really doesn't matter. Literally. You're not buying Bitcoin. You're buying something tied to the market value of Bitcoin. So if you're buying as an investment, you really only care about the relative changes, not the absolute difference. 
I don't get why people don't get that.

Well do you you want to address my question (define what is 'right') instead of backing down? Nut up or shut up. I prefer the second one.

@_date: 2017-07-06 17:20:20
You have to have a price at which you'd sell or exchange for something else or else they are worthless. 
In the same way that lost coins are worthless. If they never move they don't really matter.
If you don't believe me, destroy the private keys. The fact that you won't means that if someone offered you something of a certain value you'd voluntarily trade.
