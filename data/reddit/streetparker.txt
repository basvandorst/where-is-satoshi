Can I withdraw from GDAX to my bank account in USD, just like on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:32:04
Do you have a source for these by any chance?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:16:00
Not sure if /s or not.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:56:32
I don't have a lot of coins so I keep it in Coinbase for now (I'll get a wallet), so there's no control of what I'm selling: I just pick BTC &gt; USD, and that's it. So technically, it should be your mentioned FIFO approach, and that's how the IRS should see it too?

I want this to be a 1hr video on the loop!!

$1M invested in a diverse three fund portfolio at 4% SWR gives you $40k/year pretty much indefinitely with a 90% success chance. Lower the SWR to 3% and the success chance goes to almost 99%. If his expenses are around $40k/year or lower, then he doesn't need to worry about any additional income, most likely ever, unless the US market tanks.

No. My point is that nothing can be enforced, that's the point of crypto. If someone commits fraud, what are you going to do? Who's going to decide which side is right, and which side is wrong? Who's going to investigate? Who's going to insure your crypto? US banks are insured; is crypto?


Theeere ya go... and that's how it all starts. We'll start with audits, then maybe take a little control (for insurance), and then we'll decide who gets what. Before you know it, crypto is no different than fiat online transactions with just a different technology.
Like I said, we cannot have it both ways.

I was referring to a different type of fraud (I agree with the article), which is what Musk talked about as well. Due to the nature of cryptocurrency, it's a perfect vehicle for it by definition, because it cannot be traced or regulated to the point that an online $ transaction can. We simply cannot have it both ways - enjoy the freedom from the government and be secured by it. Crypto is not perfect, and fiat currency will always have some advantages over it. You cannot have your cake and eat it too.

Which is possible after Wall Street gets its own "government backed" crypto and then forces everybody towards it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:01:13
To be completely honest, crypto  is actually a perfect platform for its own system of fraud. Ellon Musk seem to agree too.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:46:24
Yeah, it's because the system is outdated. It needs to be revised. For now, that's just what it is, even if clearly it shouldn't be this way. They'll probably adjust it in the next 5 years. IRS is actually one of the more competent parts of the government.

But technically, anybody who holds BTC in Coinbase has BCH (somewhere)? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:57:52
Aaaaand it's back up.

More governments now are announcing adopting ETH than they are BTC. Companies are also more interested in ETH than in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:17:24
Trust me, they're the least happy party in this. They could've been cashing in big time right now if the site wasn't down.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:58:19
It's already back up and will continue surpassing BTC in growth. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:32:28
Yeah, that would fall under some kind of insider trading aspect. As the largest exchange, I don't think CB is stupid enough to do that kind of stuff, especially since they're soon to be under a close watch from the IRS and other institutions. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:23:29
Why would that be intentional? What would be the point of preventing yourself from making tons of cash from an increased amount of transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:20:23


You're speaking of ETH? No it won't.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:21:39
What scam? They're scamming themselves at most. Do you know how they make money? From transactions. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:20:59
I feel like all these theories are based on the assumption that BTC will continue to improve, while the rest won't. Why would you assume that ETH won't do more, won't fix their issues, won't improve, etc?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:24:35
By that logic, US dollar has even less value than BTC. It's literally supported by NOTHING. Nothing - not gold, not silver. Just an illusion.
