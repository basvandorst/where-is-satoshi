But just like money laundering, insider trading is one of these "victimless crimes" where you don't actually con anyone. All you do is profit from information you have access to, for your own personal gain and without robbing it from anyone.

Except if you have a large amount of money that you need to transfer internationally, you're probably not the kind of guy who wants a currency that can change by 20% in a few hours.

Well it can still be around 2-3% on a bad day. If sometimes margins do not exceed 5%, so you lose a lot of money.

What you are missing is that crypto is not considered a publicly listed asset therefore it is not illegal to insider trade it.

You've just described what economists have been pondering for centuries about deflation. 
What happens is that at the next financial crisis, everybody will just store all of their money into Bitcoin, making it's price skyrocket and depleting the real economy from any liquidity and consumption, which could make matters even worse.

This is precisely how the first calculation of a Bitcoin was calculated in 2010. Since then it has been floating according to market forces.

No one is forbidding large groups of small investors though. There is no ban on that. It's just that once that's the case, the company has additional obligations in order to protect the rights of the small investors. And start up companies don't want to deal with that. The alternative is to abandon protecting the rights of small investors, and this is the beginning of a world where small time investors investing a part of their life savings in a company can get fucked over.

It's all fun and games when the market is bullish like it is right now. But when ICOs will start to fail hard, and ICO devs will risk facing the anger of a 50k+ strong telegram group, accepting only a small pool of very wealthy and professional investors will start to make a lot of sense.
