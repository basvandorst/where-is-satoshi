Will I be able to verify my account when you guys get the site back up in its limited capacity? I understand trading will not be available so I would like to get my account verified as soon as possible.

I have a Coinbase account. If I was to use a gambling site, and I use an intermediary wallet like blockchain.info would my account  still get closed? How far do they trace your coins?
I used to make money gambling btc and then send it to Bitfinex to margin trade but understandably I don't want to store any money on Bitfinex at the moment.
What other exchanges can I use that don't care about gambling sites? BTC-e probably right?

I don't see why you think he's incompetent. He's a PR guy, who is advised by the legal team about what he should and should not say or respond to. 
If anything, in terms of making sure they cover their own asses he was probably slightly incompetent by answering too many questions early on in the fiasco and creating so many contradictory narratives.

I got a response from compliance. You need two forms of government issued ID. Passport and drivers license (front and back) work if you are in the US. You also need a current bank statement, and proof of address that does not include more banking information (so a utility or credit bill for example). You also need to complete two forms. If you PM your email address I can send you these two forms if you want as the only way to get them is through compliance at this time.

Thanks man, I also emailed so I if I hear back I'll be sure to do the same. I have all the documents I think I'd need as a US citizen, maybe I should just send them anyway. I want to move along on the process as fast as possible obviously.

My guess would be a photo of your passport, a photo of your driver's license if you live in the US, or some other kind of government issued photo ID, and a photo of a check so they can confirm you bank routing number and bank account number.
Other than that they need to know your full name obviously but that can be referenced on the documents. Finally, with the site being down they would need your username and possibly your password. I'm just hesitant to send all that because of security reasons obviously. That is all my personal identification information sent to an email I need to trust.

Greed? It's our money. I don't see how wanting 2/3 of our money now is greedy when compared to waiting 2+ years for less than 2/3 of our money.

Agreed, i stand to lose a lot here; but taking this to court you wont see money for years. Years. The best case is haircut for some users and then they are paid back incrementally.

Since the site is down I do not know exactly what documents I would need to email to compliance. Can you please tell me which documents are required? Passport, US Driver's License, Social Security Card, voided check, etc.?

I'm basically sitting here refreshing his comment history. This is very stressful. I "luckily" didn't have any BTC balance on the site but at this point I don't know if that even matters.

How do you expect to get more back? And how long from now?

Please update you post on what compliance has to say about which documents are necessary. I need to do this as well.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:43:29
Can you please list the verification documents required so I can do this as soon as possible.

Yes, people like to read, and no you don't have to be in college.
