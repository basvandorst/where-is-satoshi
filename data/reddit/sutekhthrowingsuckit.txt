Bitcoin isn’t serious

So does a cum box

I mean a portion of the user base here is hoping for a massive global financial crash in which people starve to death and desperately seek non-fiat alternative currency allowing these sociopaths to raise themselves to be the new elite by price gauging the hell out of those who didn’t buy bitcoin earlier. 
The rest are just looking to dump BTC on “greater fools” who are buying in at the top of the next bubble the hope of getting rich.

Not what I said at all. Deflation reduces investment incentive. That doesn't mean there is no ingenuity in the face of major technological breakthroughs. It means that there is less incentive for individuals to invest in innovative ideas.
