Yeah the facts are its not really a currency anymore and has not been for some time.  It's basically a strange product, never seen anything like it.  
When some major event rocks the coin again, it will be interesting.  Imagine a gox 2.0 but coinbase this time.  EPIC!!!

Wow more ways I can buy bitcoin and even less ways to spend it.  
Everything is going great!  
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:38:37
Have you not been reading the news?  Its all about places no longer taking bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:55:24
This whole post is so pathetic.  We all missed out on being BTC millionaires buy not buying.  He had other issues, BTC is not the cause.  
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:30:17
before or after the lastest small crash?  Get out while you still can.   
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:53:51
Man, you crypto kids are deluded beyond all my knowledge.  The drop has not even fucking started yet.  Fair value = 0 
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:17:04
They would make their own coins though.  Again, its not hard to make a working coin, nobody is going to use someone else's coin and give them all the value.

This may be hard for you to understand, but BTC may never recover.  Crypto may go down as nothing more than a failure.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:16:22
Remember if you down 50% you need 100% gains to even recover.  That's whats fucked up and most forget that.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:04:00
Thats pure bullshit, nobody can say that for sure.  Every big player would be investing right now if it was true.  
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:26:37
It will go to zero long term.  BTC is not the future, lets be real.  
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:59:06
I believe some coins may have value someday.  For example, if Facebook made a coin, or amazon.  Current coins are just scams.  
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:20:23
Lets all pull out of exchanges and see crypto crash.. Yahhhhhhhhh.  LOL  such dumb fucks in this crpyto shit.  
@_date: 2019-02-01 21:04:52
LOL, are you that low IQ?  You are wanting EVERYONE to pull out of exchanges and manager their own shitcoins?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:43:55
 Everyone know what the real Bitcoin is.  No they don't.  You are dumb.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:33:38
Ur dad is a dumbass.  It must go back up....right guys?
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:46:57
Yeah Ok, this sub is all about responsible investing and being cautious about bitcoin...GTFO of here.  The story is made up anyway.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:31:22
Yeah, educate them on the "real" bitcoin so they can lose their money.  What a nice guy you are...How do you not understand?  Crypto is a huge scam.  You are paying 1000s to control some numbers on a computer database.  Numbers you could lose so easily, with no recovery.  LOL
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:35:32
YAAAA stream for huge money!!
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:22:29

@_date: 2018-07-31 14:32:22
This is exactly why this trash will NEVER be widely used.  Its great for an "investment"  Trash to actually use and handle yourself.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:52:12
I love seeing how much a shit show crypto is.  How the fuck is BTC above 8K even now?  It's nutty.  
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:52:24
