I have had similar "tough luck" responses after been locked out of the iPhone wallet, while I never trusted the mobile wallet with any more than 1 BTC its still a costly hit to take just for the the privilege of using a buggy crash prone wallet. I'm still looking for something better but getting sick of loosing small amounts of coin testing other peoples bad code.

There has to be some responsibility on the software developer. Blaming the victim for not fully testing bad software is like saying to the guy who's breaks failed after he ran over his kid, "Oh man your such a dick you were supposed to fully test the breaks on your car before attempting to drive it on a road ... every one knows breaks some times fail."

It took me about a year as an experienced trading system developer. Like any start up every thing has to be a compromise between time to market and a minimum feature set. However unlike your typical social media start up when it comes to bitcoin there is really absolutely no room to  compromise on security.  I would not say it took longer than I expected. Having worked for wall street banks in the past some things are actually faster however its a completely different product. In the large banks its all latency and volume focused. The networks are private and we would never dream of using a HTTP JSON API or websockets to publish market data. In the bitcoin world these are more or less minimum requirements for an exchange.  Personally I think the coinsetter plug about offering a "Wall Street" quality system is a bit hyped but I've watched their progress with interest since that first bootstrap webpage template and I enjoy the updates.
