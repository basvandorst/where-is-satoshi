The fundamentals of ETH are objectively more sophisticated than bitcoins and the potential for applications of smart contract technology is endless
Bitcoin literally doesn't do shit lol 
Keep bein salty though.

How is bitcoin sound when core devs intentionally keep block sizes small so they can charge a premium to bump transactions to the top of the list? The whole point of bitcoin is to not have a centralized authority making rules. Fuck outta here

No, as determined by the terms of the smart contract. No third parties at all. Nice try though shill

Bitcoin is a garbage coin. The flippening is 80% there, move your funds to ETH where you won't pay exorbitant fees or wait 2 weeks for your transaction to be confirmed. Fuck bitcoin

What's better, a cell phone from the 80's or the latest iPhone? LOL

How is ethereum a scam? All bitcoin does is move money from point a to point b. 
Ethereum is a network that allows funds to move from a to b...when conditions x y and z are met. If bitcoin is a book, ethereum is a computer. 
There are actually fundamentals there. A lot of these ICO's are for groundbreaking projects in development. The amount of brain power in ETH is staggering, just look at the ethereum enterprise alliance happening today in China. Hundreds of big players are there
What does bitcoin have? Greedy core developers who intentionally keep their product shitty so they can charge premiums for faster transactions?? The fees are already insane and the scalability issue is a disaster. The whole vision of bitcoin was to eliminate centralized oversight lol. You dickhead hater
