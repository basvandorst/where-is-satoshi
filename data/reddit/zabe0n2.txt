It's capped, it can't go back up until fees are fixed because it isn't usable at those prices. Lightning network won't be adopted by the general public, so what will fix it? If it's fixed, 20k-40k definitely is possible man, but it has to be fixed, and if it takes too long then eventually it will be replaced.

Read what I said next time, I addressed lightning.

Apple store removed it, Steam store removed it, and local stores are removing it. Darknets are replacing it with litecoin. Nothing is replacing it in most instances though.

That is the smallest market use for bitcoin. It may be secondary to you, but it's used around the world in stores, a lot of websites have adopted it, and the darknet uses it. But now all of them are moving away from it due to fees, it's a currency first and foremost, not a speculative asset with inherent value.

Lightning network really isn't the answer.

Litecoin is being used as an alternative on a lot of darknet sites. But litecoin isn't worth investing in right now imo, I think it'll go down to under $200 then it's worth it. It's also being added to several sites later in 2018, such as amazon. So in the long run it can bring in some profit if you invest at a good price.

Lot of ignorant people upvoted you, it's because of the -price-, not usage. It hit a brickwall called fees due to the price, so it isn't sustainable over 15k, and more and more are cashing out their investment since there isn't a solution. I hope you enjoy it under 10k.

Commonsense isn't your forte? Fees brought a wall, it isn't going back up buddy. Not until they fix it, and lightning network isn't the answer. People are going to start dropping their investment soon, it's being removed from more and more stores/websites. I think we'll see it under 10k soon.

No, I know it won't go up, it's called common sense. Try using it. How the fuck is a currency going to go up in price when it isn't even usable without spending $15-$40 just on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:56:11
Boop Beep, yes, you're ridiculous. It'll never go back up like I said until fees are fixed.

You didn't bother reading anything I said. Submitted 1 minute and you people are already posting.

The last time it hit 19k it became unusable for common transactions, $15 fee on anything, just sending small amounts. $40 fee on trying to send like $180. 
Has that been fixed? Or would it end up being ridiculous fees again making it crash?
