I bought 32k worth of bitcoin last year, when they were around $600 each.  All that friggin' btc... and then I had to sell due to a financial emergency when they were around 750.  Just bought back in for $165,  when I could've made over 300k over the last year if I could've held.  I will regret that as long as I live.

Congrats, OP!  I love seeing success stories like that - it cheers me up from my adventures with BTC.  I bought in for about $32k from an inheritance last year when they were fluctuating between 600 and 650ish.  Then, after committing money to a few big purchases, my Multiple Sclerosis flared up and rendered me unable to keep working.  My employer's insurance company denied my disability claim for several months over some utter B.S.  With no other savings, I had to sell all of my coins to get through the following several months' bills and meet my commitments, then keep my wife and I afloat while I waited to have a reduced income come in through the disability insurance.  It was mostly the aforementioned BTC, with maybe an extra 1k in ETH, and I sold it all around when BTC was at 650-700.  Seeing that I would've made a total of nearly 10x my initial investment within a year is beyond frustrating and depressing.  I hate that my wife and I have to eke by, and without the disability happening, or without the insurance screwing me,  we would have been very comfortable.
I recently bought back into cryptos with a whopping $155 in BTC, $20 in ETH, and $25 in LTC.  Even that was a huge sacrifice for us, and I fear that I won't be able to hodl to see any worthwhile gains, let alone be able to buy more as time goes by.
I feel like having to sell and not coming up with some sort of way to get by last year will be the biggest regret that I will have in my entire life.
So thank you for showing that it can be done, and that the moon can be reached.  Sorry for the rant.
