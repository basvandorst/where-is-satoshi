Even we use to accept it sir but put that on Hold . Once regulation clarity is in place we will start accepting
@_date: 2018-08-16 12:50:48
Msg i received from the gentleman 
"I wanted to pay with Bitcoin in your restaurant. I saw the name of the bistro as Bitcoin Bistro, I went to your facebook page and saw a promotion and you accept bitcoin. On that basis we went and had a meal. Then after your staff would not accept bitcoin. So this is what I am going to do for you. On facebook, reddit and every restaurant guide on the planet I am going to say how bad the food was, how rude the staff were, how you lied about accepting bitcoin. I will fuck you over so bad....""""
It is very rude
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:41:47
As I explained that new regulations in Thailand is unclear thats the reason for not accepting . Though we do lot of education and meetups around cryptos there and quite active in community
@_date: 2018-08-19 10:35:52

@_date: 2018-08-16 16:23:18

@_date: 2018-08-16 10:14:15
Hi .
I am the owner of BitcoinBistro in Pattaya. Need to Clarify my stand .
1) We have no where promoted that we accept bitcoin ( any body proving that we have done such promotion , we will give him free meal) 
2) Thailand has new regulations on Cryptocurrencies which are quite unclear yet and accepting bitcoin at this moment can run us  in legal issues.
3) we are 5 star rated restaurant who take care of food and service bery well .
4) on contacted me the guest started yelling and swearing at me which was unwarranted amd shocking .
5) we have recieved threat by the guest that he will malign us on varius forums.
Rest is on community to decide . 
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:06:29
No more sir .
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:09:56
Even we use to accept it sir but put that on Hold . Once regulation clarity is in place we will start accepting
