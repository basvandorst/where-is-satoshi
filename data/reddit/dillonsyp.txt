I’ve been using my regular chase checking account for a decent figure on bitcoin purchases. Not problems so far, knock on wood. I’ve even gone in to the bank before to wire cash &amp; i told them it was for bitcoin. Attendant helping me actually asked some questions about bitcoin and was glad to help.

I think people highly discredit what people will pay to own part of the original blockchain. Especially down the line; I believe that once the tech sees mass adoption, it will be a premium rarity to own a bitcoin. Even if bitcoin is not used directly as a currency, it can still be a store of value none the less. 
Basically “Digital gold” only just a guaranteed finite amount. We know no body is going to stumble across a new bitcoin mine next week. Makes it better than gold, imo.

I’m a computer engineering student and obviously I advocate bitcoin. I think some people are a little behind, some still don’t understand. But this is the future.

Honestly I've spent a pretty penny through their exchanges. I assume when you become a more high profile client you get bumped up on the waiting list. Just my assumption. 
Honestly though you should just buy through gdax, it's coinbases other company their trading platform. No fees to purchase as long as you sell for like a Satoshi off the "last" price or "bid" price 
Edit: it's also instant I believe

I would be freaking out. Praying for you buddy. Also a good time to add: I stopped using kraken the first time I used that exchange. God awful and they do only get on top of things when we post here, they have multiple mods that lurk r/bitcoin and will try to make the brand look responsible. Use bittrex, fuck kraken

You are correct on your information. I’m sure it’s not a halving just a difficulty increase.
As far as the rest of what you said, super interesting but we know that situation wouldn’t play out too well having one guy mine from his android lol. From what I understand we owe essentially our whole ecosystem to the miners, so a quick cheers to them ��

You are locked in on the price you bought that day. It's a contract. It's not your fault they take days to fill orders. They should've sent you an email. Whatever the email says, that is the amount you shall receive.
I was lucky enough to be upgraded to "coinbase instant" I get my deposits, well, instantly of course. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:57:38
That's actually pretty decent.. As soon as they can get it just a little over 50% faster, it will become much more standard. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:57:35
I know you're new but theres trading exchanges and then direct sales exchanges like coinbase. Gdax is literally coin base but their trading platform you're actually directly trading with other people instantly. I believe it also supports other coins but I havent used gdax before personally

+1 I totally missed that. OP, you promised your gf you would propose?
Sounds to me like you're having doubts about it. Just, make a well thought out decision. Sounds like a critical one for you bud
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:27:37
Does put you in a 1% to own a whole bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:30:03
Gdax you have to use your computer, no app. It's not as user friendly as coinbase but like I said, you can avoid fees which you will learn is one of the key rules to investing, *keeping fees minimal *
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:24:15
Were basically all already doing this
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:16:41

Pump the breaks there. He didn't say he was marrying her also he only has maybe ~0.5 BTC to his name considering a 20k BTC would put his entire fund at the price of a trip for two to Japan. 
I don't think OP is very worried about his portfolio of assets. Half of nothing is still nothing.
Edit: words omitted 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:30:52
He’s worried but not enough to liquidate his assets and go balls deep in crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:55
Yeah no Robin hood bud. Bitcoin isn't offered in an ETF, yet. It will be huge news when that comes though. 
Your coinbase account will link to gdax like I said they are the same entity. They are trust worthy. 
However, if you want the convenience and don't care about 1.5% fee on buys, coinbase is the most user friendly platform no doubt.
P.S. I take it you're fairly young and new to investing. Smart to diversify between assets. Most newbies jump all in to bitcoin with no knowledge. You're on the right track, and always remember; knowledge is leverage. Educate yourself big time, immerse your self in crypto and stock / business news. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:41:05
And you dont pay a higher fee lol same 1.5%
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:21:54
Good to know. How are they on fees ? Need to start looking in to what exchange I will sell SOME of my btc to at a certain price point

Hey man not everyone is the best programmer but he was able to get it off the ground. That’s when you obviously do what he did and team up with other people with concrete, diverse value they can add to the project. To have btc be his brain child though, and even if it crashes to 0 right now (knock on wood) . It would still be nothing short of a revolutionary concept brought forth by Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:40:42
As far as you know I have no bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:56:35

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:51:12
Okay but every conservative, traditional investor will tell you that. Also have to remember that most of them have reasons to denounce bitcoin. Mostly for personal gains. 
1. Their capital is solely in usd. They have to be at least a little worried of bitcoin. Considering it’s dominating usd value.
2. They analyze from a traditional investors perspective. Y’all have to understand we are pioneering this market. This is new and unprecedented. Except apparently by some flowers.. In the 1600s... When capitalism was just being birthed. 
3. Touching on what was stated above; they analyze from a traditional investors perspective. Most of them are probably old fashioned , stick to bonds, etfs, mutual funds ( which they shouldn’t) while it’s safe it’s not like the stock market doesn’t see 69% crashes. Not to mention we’re long overdue for a bear market.
4. We’re going to da moon �� 
Also I feel that whenever big name investors or billionaire super stars speak against bitcoin, not all, but some definitely have personal gains they’re seeking by spreading FUD. they know bitcoin is a problem. That’s why any article you read about investing in bitcoin will say don’t do it. But why listen to the ruling upper class ? You think you’re in their best interest ? You think they haven’t stored away thousands of bitcoin ? Keep dreaming . The world works like clockwork and every message is portrayed to illicit a specific response. It’s how you decide to respond that matters. 
Edit: I listened to the institutional perspective on bitcoin for years. Been following since 2012 at $80. Of course people thought it was a joke. Only something to buy illegal drugs on Silk Road with. Then I fell into some cash in 2014 and checked bitcoin again as an investment. It’s an echo chamber. Everyone tied to a massive corporation or bank will advise against it. Fast forward another few years 2017 I checked again. It broke $1000. Surely I looked into investing , again. And found the same advice again. But this time I decided to do more extensive research. What I found along with my old reactions of “Internet money?? What’s the value in that??” Was the spark to get in. I had had the wrong reaction every time, and I still thought it was crazy over priced. But I decided I was wrong every other time, might as well take the chance. Here I am a year later and probably worth double what I was at the beginning of the year. I love crypto not just because of money but I want as loose of government ties as possible. Crypto is a huge step toward taking matters in to our own hands.

Bitcoin/ether got me in to investing. I downloaded Robin hood back in like 2015. Bought 50 shares of AMD for ~$2.00 because I read that Microsoft was considering acquiring them. I don't believe that acquisition happened but we do know where AMD went. When I saw 400% gains my fire was lit. I just think it's interesting how bitcoin was the factor in sparking the initial interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:32

I actually made what I consider to be a small fortune in bitcoin. Being in Florida and feeling some of the effects from hurricane Irma, made me realize the intensity and destructive power of these massive storms. I don’t know if y’all know this, but Puerto Rico is still 92% without power from hurricane Maria. They made it up to 50% or so and just the other week a power plant exploded. Puerto Rico really has been left out to dry. 
I’ve recently cashed out almost all my bitcoin earnings and will be headed to Puerto Rico to help rebuild with my earnings. I’m not asking you to donate to me directly, though you can if you want lol. But I feel that at least one of your coins, should be donated toward the island of Puerto Rico in efforts to rebuild that beautiful island.

@_date: 2017-11-25 14:43:59
It is starting to sound better for newcomers. Like oh $800 for &lt;0.1 BTC or $800 for 10 million Satoshis. For a newbie, I imagine the latter is much more attractive 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:24:17
I'm glad other's agree. I've been contemplating this matter for the past few weeks.. Not everything will be exactly what the creator intended. I feel that bitcoin at this point is more of a digital store of value rather than a currency. I'm also completely okay with that.

I have to say reddit is one of my favorite sources for information. The plethora of knowledge and ability to see how the community feels about certain aspects, coins, etc. - it all gives you that edge. So quick thank you to reddit &amp; the reddit community

Crypto is a speculation. Not an investment 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:08:36
That's not close to what this conversation has been about. If that was your point from the start I would've agreed with you. I hold some bitcoin but I don't fool myself to thinking it's my smartest investment or even an investment at all. There's nothing wrong with speculating. I speculate all the time via buying and selling options and the aforementioned crypto holdings. I don't, however, lie to myself about what my investments and or speculations are.

Not true. Speculation =/= investing
I do not argue about the future of bitcoin though. I fully believe in the concept and technology. At the same time, like I mentioned before. I have no problem coming to terms that the money I have tied up in bitcoin is purely of speculative interest. Though I have made gains, it's not because I'm a smart investor.

You have a very askewed view of the monetary system. It would probably take a whole college semester to instruct you what is wrong with your reasoning. Have a good one dude 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:12:25
No, it still is. You're speculating on all those aspects of bitcoin. Essentially betting that they will be embraced by the bulk of society and governments.

There are many bitcoin millionaires who are looking for offers like this. Considering it takes out the tedious task of going from btc &gt; fiat first, it’s a very appealing offer to be able to buy a whole house for the bitcoin some have laying around.

The ol' buy high, don't sell, and just keep buying high tactic. Nice OP!

This whole comment proves my point that y’all don’t understand basic economic concept

If you want to sell for current market price on GDAX, you instead should put in a “limit” order for $0.01 above the price. When filled at limit order there are no fees. Never do a market sell / buy. It works both ways like this on gdax

Wow “one venture capitalist” was quoted saying that. Everyone praise “one venture capitalist.” What a fantastic source 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:42:02
Obviously not because we still printed more money
Edit: now you are getting somewhere though, a bitcoin backed currency would not be out of the question 
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:36:29
Looking at your post history and your reasoning behind these comments. My analysis had concluded you have no idea wtf you're talking about 
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:51:52
Who cares 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:27:30
Maybe because I don't want to wait 60 minutes for 6 confirmations to go through? Or have to go through the bull shit of opening a LN channel with every new gas station I stop at

You are just full of fucking excuses. No wonder you’re in the situation you are in. I don’t pity you one bit. If all the information you have shared is accurate, you need to do a big 180 with your life and get your shit together man.

Our government purposely inflates the dollar as an incentive for people to invest rather than hoard money. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:56:53
I still recommend you take it out of bitcoin. If it’s all you have, secure it now that’s a little over $600 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:18:18
I mean, that would constitute a continuing bull market so... it would make me feel better

You’re living in a fantasy if you think 30% is what traditional investors expect. Try ~10% bud.

Do you have a bank account? Link the bank account, sell the bitcoin &amp; transfer the cash to your bank. 
Seriously dude, I love bitcoin as much as the next guy but you need money you can spend on food &amp; other necessities. Gotta put your needs first 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:07:53
Nice ���� 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:54:10
That would be the opposite of inflation &amp; would encourage people to hoard money like I said. Why spend or invest any of your money if you knew for a fact it was going to just gain value as it sat there ?
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:58:05
You have it backwards

Governments do not create economic growth. However I am saying without increased money supply, incentive to do better would vanish. People could just get wealthy to a certain point and then hoard money. We need money to flow through an economy for it to be robust. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:29:55
A higher return from what extra money ? Where does that money come from ?

That’s the spirit, higher the cost average, lower the gains. You’re smart. Smart “investor”

True number is 20.999.999 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:03:20
No. It would not work like that. I love bitcoin as much as the next guy, But a lot of the fan boys around here have 0 concept of economic workings. 
The most simple way to explain this is: The reason the government prints more money is it incentives growth in production in an economy. Without inflation, economic growth would stagnate.

“Crypto is to money/banks as email is to the post office.” Crypto will not replace fiat, however, it will be revolutionary technology regardless if everyone realizes it yet

I think a couple exchanges allow you to trade on margin to short positions. Not entirely sure which ones though
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:15:48
Not true, you can sell on gdax and withdraw for no fees

He’s right. Correlation is calculated in traditional investments. What you are pointing out is a correlation.
