Yeah I forgot china was white. ��. You’re a bot lmao. Maybe it has something to do with how countries that actually produce shit and trade tend to make more money than those that are failing.

30$ isn't that high of a risk. I would watch it for a few hours and wait for it to get real close to 8k. if it doesn't, buy in.

yeah plus I wanna know what knowledge you possess.

It’s talking about how well-known people in their fields doubted a new technology and then it ending up being extremely popular. 
This has everything to do with bitcoin.

lol. I just wanted to know what people think. I'd like to watch it for a bit before putting in thousands.

Good thing BTC won’t end like 300 does... that would suck...

It’s talking about how people doubt stuff when they have no idea what the future is. It really isn’t that hard to understand. Even if you disagree with the message, it’s pretty clear.

Wow that timing was great. Went from 165 to 184 like right after I bought.
