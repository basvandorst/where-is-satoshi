yikes. a lot can happen in one month.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:42:05
so what's the next step? pay the extra money and have the transaction processed? bitcoin is not going anywhere in terms of having the mempool cleared..
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:17:09
i haven't personally tried it, but it may work for you. good luck
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:23:46
This just happened to me.. i was freaking out. it took 2.4 hours to get 1 confirmation. smh.

Sensationalist article that provides no proof and is only spreading fud.
Why are bitcoiners such obnoxious cunts? Why can't you just shut up and hold your bitcoins quietly and appreciate the gains?
Why do you lose your minds at 15-20% drawbacks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:49
Actually, Roger Ver is helping get Ross Ulbricht out of jail.
Roger Ver is actually acquainted and good friends with Ross's parents.
I don't think you know what you are talking about and just post angry comments.
How much core kool-aid have you drank?

This may be the first currency I actually use if we get proper wallet integrations.
0 fees and instant transfer is what is required.
Raiblocks has solved some of the main issues with crypto-currencies. Speed &amp; Cost.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:41
My bad... there's just so much bull shit and Roger bashing on this subreddit it is ridiculous.

I look forward to LN being released.. i hear rumors of 9 months + out before it's released...
is it all a matter of a count down now?
Bitcoin Cash holders are convinced this will be the reckoning for BTC.. what's the sentiment over here?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:10:16
I completely disagree with you. Bitcoin Cash embodies the true version of Bitcoin.
[This was on the news today. One of the largest VPN providers adopted BCH. Why would anyone, including business want to use a high fee coin? Credit cards charge 2-3% transaction already. No need to adopt, but with BCH, they can pay less, save more.](
Also, check out[ this website.]( It is growing in adoption, exponentially. The website has a huge list of industries and companies that have adopted BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:45
man, people on this subreddit are ass holes..
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:09:05
Meh, I just don't agree with the name argument.
Bitcoin name is not a trademark and bitcoin source code isn't patented. This is all open source work and everyone should be allowed to use the name how ever it wants.
it reminds of the term "cola" or "sriracha" or "xerox paper"
it has lost it's private ownership.. when people ask me about cryptos, they dont say cryptos, they say "which bitcoins did you buy"
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:23:08
Lol, you are in for a rude awakening when Gemini announces they're listing Bitcoin Cash.
These exchanges are more profit driven than politic driven.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:30:55
man, i've heard horrible stuff about Gemini infrastructure from ex employees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:21:18
well, you're weak.
you don't understand fundamentals and how blockchain technology works and will eventually effect the world.
bitcoin is total garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:57:50
lol, you say it in such a spiteful way. why are your panties in a bunch?
It's Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, simple.
Be more productive and spread knowledge and information on block-chain, instead of fighting amongst yourselves.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:02:07
I agree to a certain degree of what you're saying, but Bitcoin Cash has brand name recognition and due to that it will have sooner adoption.
It shits all over Bcore, does everything better, with minimal fees, has wide spread support and more people are becoming woke.
Sure, alts like XRB are way better, almost free to use, but that adoption isn't here. Bitcoin Cash, however, is here and ready to use. Visa is even coming soon for it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:18
Bitcoin isn't decentralized dude, why are you even here?
The entire goal for Bitcoin was to be a decentralized currency that no one can control. What is with the horde mentality of the masses on this sub reddit?
False news on front page about investigations and news reports of insider trading... jesus christ.
is it hard to imagine there is a valid demand for bitcoin cash?
it is legitimately the only coin that works and is ready for mass adoption.
Why is so hell bent slowing the rate of adoption?
Do you want Crypto currencies to become a fad of the past?
Do you want your investments to get fucked by central banks again?
Stop being so hell bent on fighting each other and focus on getting crypto currencies to the masses.
before you know it, will come and eat this entire subreddit with 0 fees.

this is my crypto reddit account, which all the subreddits i follow such as raiblocks, iota, btc, bitcoin, ripple, monero, etc are on here which i have a curated newsfeed for.
Why does it matter that i'm on a new reddit account? I am not a troll and I've been on Reddit for over 6 years now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:49:29
i just set up my wallet recently, thanks for the insight!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:53:51
the entire backend is glued together with quick fixes and is not made to scale.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:53:46
How about the fact that insider trading laws don't pertain to crypto currencies and only apply to equities?
Dumb dumb, let me guess, you are a perma Bitcoin holder?
They seem to be the unintelligent sort. Posting memes and garbage circle jerking around Roger Ver all day.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:15:52
Thanks for your insight!
I am a young investor as well and often find myself feeling stupid because I sold too early.
(Bought IOTA @ .48 and sold at .52. Bought again at .88 and sold at .98)
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:38:09
nope not clicking this.
also OP, you didn't have to do this. It was stupid.
edit: scrolled through to 2:05, turns out it was a rick roll. I am glad. I'll take rick roll any day over someone harming themselves..

How can you determine whether your account has been compromised?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:03:57
that's rad of you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:26:49
hahaha, i was doing research. In class, I randomly remembered Bit Petite debacle a few weeks ago and some people were saying "hang on guys, they will be back as soon as the server is done being upgraded" and i remembered thinking "nah, they got scammed", so i googled bit petite and their website doesn't show up anymore either, which then brought me to this post.
What brought you to this post?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:27:22
well he moved his bitcoin, so yes, he has to use a segwit address..
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:25:47
Well, he got robbed. That was the result.
