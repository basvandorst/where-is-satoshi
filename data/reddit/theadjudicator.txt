[Apparently]( she only submitted the first address, not the second one (where the bitcoins went to). 
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:37:31
Which one of the addresses mentioned [here]( did you originally post?
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:12:24
So you didn't get the bitcoin at all then? Since they got sent to the second..
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:19:52


How is Poloniex in this regard? How's the security there? Any signs of trouble there yet?
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:03:16
I'm a bit lost here.. so the "hacker" managed to find an account with a weak password ('randomly'), and edits the posted address to:
right before he sends the bitcoins there?
Has the original user gotten their account back, can mods see the logged in IPS or something?
If so, does she control the "1NYT.." address since she originally posted a different one?
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:33:45


You might need to refresh your memory. The 1000 coins were sent to the second address (1NYT1..) which she claimed the hacker added.  


Well it wouldn't hurt, but keep the info correct at least. However since that ship has sailed, let *me* explain with "big letters".
Just for easy recap so we can refresh our memories:
1. [here's the original "hacker post".](  
2. And to be absolutely sure, here is the [wallet]( 
3. and then [read her answer]( to my first question again.  
This should get *you* up to speed.

Hm, let's give this a try..
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:35:38
Why do you think Polo is next? Are there any red flags occuring there?
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:35:27
What? He randomly picked you from that main thread and sent you a btc?
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:32:22
Way more "ok" than no one getting a cent back.. yea.
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:17:38


What do they mean with this exactly?
Lets say I buy $50 worth of bitcoins. After 7 days, do I get it on the price it was 7 days ago? 
Or the current rate, 7 days after I made the purchase?
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:46:55
Where did you get the address?
@_date: 2014-07-03 00:01:47
What's the best way to change bitcoins to kenyan shilling? 
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:21:38


Except, they're not mineable at all.. so they can't exactly be "premined".
@_date: 2015-01-16 11:00:02
Didn't dollar deposits to Cryptsy go through them?
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:42:02
Might be luck as well... it's like martingaling or something, it'll work until it doesn't. I'm not saying it is either way, we'll see eventually.
@_date: 2016-10-02 14:49:02


They do? I'm Icelandic and that's the first time I've heard about it. Biggest issue currently is that we have capital controls on, which makes purchasing Bitcoins quite hard.
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:24:01


In that example, what if the price goes up to 2000$, whilte you're locked at 1000$?
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:57:34
The title is absolutely wrong. The first numbers are in now, and as expected nothing changes. The right wing party has the lead, way above the polls and the Pirates are way below the polls. 
It's a bit funny that the frontman of the "winning" party was not only in the panama paper leaks, but also the Ashley Madison leaks.
@_date: 2016-10-02 17:45:59
Hm, depends on what kind of tech work are you talking about?
Most places I've seen/worked at had mostly locals doing stuff like IT, web related jobs etc. Places like CCP have some foreign contractors, I think its more spread there.  
However in non-tech jobs such as construction etc, you have a lot (mostly eastern europeans).
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:47:13
Haha, I guess it'd be worth it for that amount of bitcoins. May I ask how much the procedure cost? If you remember.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:44:21
That must have been pretty expensive procedure, right?
I had a firmware corrupt on a harddrive a few years ago and sent an email to a data recovery company. 
The price for fixing that was a few thousands dollars.
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:27:09
Too bad there are literally no ways to buy Bitcoins here in Iceland, except Virwox which takes like 15-20% or something equally ridiculous as fee with multiple steps that no one will bother going through.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:09:31
This stuff is way above my level, I was lost in the first paragraph of the OP. However, I'm curious if technically, anyone can do what this guy did?
Which I assume is:


@_date: 2016-10-30 13:37:04
Instead a party led by a guy who had his name both in the panama paper leaks and ashley maddison leaks won.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:50:36
I started using PRC after Just-dice shut down. 
No problems at either place so far.
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:21:58


Jesus, people do that? Do people just give their money to randoms on the chat to let them gamble? 
At first when you started talking about "investing" I thought you meant similarly to what you can do on Just-dice or Pocketrockets Casino, investing in the house bankroll.
