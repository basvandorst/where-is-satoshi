Any reason to believe this could be something other than bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:35:20
Major outage.

I'm not threatening Mark, but I wouldn't be shocked if he was found dead within the year.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:54:41
Let's have a healthy debate on this. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:01:40
A bitcorn expert. An expert of bitcorn. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:37:36
Yea DW- plenty of bears over in who welcome your opinion. I support your input here, I think the community should welcome critics in healthy debate.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:16:14
I lost a lot of money today. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:16:19
Can someone explain to me how he got the name bitcorn?
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:25:28
Galt's Gulch?
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:44:36
Satisfied. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:40:47
Goodbye guys. It's over.
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:13:45
My mom is fighting it. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:29:31
Wait guys, hold on. This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:47:06
Accountants...brokers....lawyers. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:17:01
I actually agree with you; there are services within banking that can not be replaced through the means described in the article. However, there are a myriad of services whose cost can be reduced substantially via automation - the blockchain offers a form of this automation. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:26:03
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:31:35
Yea Byron, it might. CC is here to stay.
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:58:27
We welcome healthy discussion. But posters should be willing to debate a point if they're going to provoke. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:59:15
Yea guys - this is good news!
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:38:26
This is a problem. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 04:43:41
Great article. Please read.
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:22:35
Sold on the dip - these fuckwits most likely bought my coins after they released the press statement.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:48:21
Same here! It's been very painful...
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:53:47
Does Mark Cuban realize it's open source?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:50:53
I'm in the same boat.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:38:02
Passed the market cap of Western Union.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:55:06
Anyone else think they have zero idea as to what is going on?
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:24:47
I live here - I would go.
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:08:50
I'd like to pay off some of my student loans.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:11:13
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:52:55
Fuck'em. Let them become obsolete like their predecessor. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:03:58
This could also be done in my home town SF - any takers? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:38:35
Then down vote. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:47:21
Shit. I just bought 1BTC here - is this problem common?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:52:40
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:08:31
Stay calm. Deep breath. Keep buying.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:53:17
You're right - it's in need of innovation and transparency. New businesses will emerge because of this. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:16:46
Is Jackie Chan endorsing BTC??
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:10:28
I was just checking Mint for this feature!
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:57:56
Now we start to see other hedge funds forced to compete; at the very least many will put in fractions of their portfolios into BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:53:08
I like how this article doesn't focus on whether bitcoin will succeed, but rather which city will own its future. 
Interesting turn around in the media as of late...
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:45:54
Wealth effect.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:43:58
Yes - done now! Thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:15:38
The ticket to the concert was cheaper then, and some of us may be closer to the stage, but you can still attend the concert. 
Don't be the person who misses the show.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:01:24
I was thinking about the ramifications of this last night - had no idea they were voting on it!
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:05:00
Well said.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:15:13
Just changed my order to 1BTC. Very exciting!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:27:46
0 or a very larger number in 2017.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:04:31
Extremely helpful. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:08:39
Nailed it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:21:14
Hide yo kids, hide yo wife.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:01:30
Can anyone else confirm this happening?
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:57:22
U mad bro? Bro, U mad?
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:34:55
Given Howard Schultz's progressive approach to business and the economy, I could foresee a day where he does make this statement.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:58:49
Yep - in the same boat. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:11:51
Bitcoin pushing Moore's law...
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:46:00
I would buy more BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:12:42
Jesus, chill out. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:50:15
I just bought $200 here. Thank you!

Before we get all righteous, it's also their job to protect people's money. I can fully understand why a money manager of 30 years, someone who has witness multiple bubbles each decade, would be hesitant to invest. 
For the rest of us who see this not as an investment, but as a disruptive technology, it makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:32:28
How do I enable this?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:12:21
I'm going to miss making it rain.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:57:29
With ya broseff.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:11:28
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:51:38
Inappropriate and unnecessary - he is doing a disservice to the bitcoin movement with statements like this.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:02:21
This may be the most realistic prediction I've read all day. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:40:44
Nice work!
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:07:25
I didn't realize how fashionable texans were.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:01:32
I actually asked a cab driver tonight if he knew of any other drivers using bitcoin. No dice.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:55:52
False. A major issue could come up in the protocol.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:03:03
Here we go...it's going to be a bumpy ride.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:35:06
Enhance. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:19:55
This is a great article, citing how ridiculous the banking system has become at virtually every level. Please vote up!
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:48:10
Price drop price drop!
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:27:11
The vision.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:22:45
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:31:40
At any given moment I have three tabs open following bitcoin exchanges. I wake up at 4am and check the price. I'm about to start a new job and I'm concerned about this being an issue to productivity. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:53:12
Is there a consensus on which Bitcoin wallet to use?
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:06:42
This has got to improve over time, and I imagine the only way it will is for a competitor to step in. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:11:32
More money would get printed.
