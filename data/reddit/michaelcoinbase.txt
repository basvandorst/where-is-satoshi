Great question. It's an implementation we developed internally. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:23:27
We've been transparent about when we have been DDoS'd. That's happened a few times this year, and it's always frustrating for us to be under that kind of attack but we're much better at dealing with it as a result.
I wasn't trying to disclaim fault - just clarifying the events connected to the slow response times. We know what happened and have fixed it so we're ready for the next surge.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:32:43
The majority, yes.  Before I joined coinbase some years ago I setup my own geographically distributed multi-party cold storage and still store some coins there, mostly for fun at this point.  Our cold storage at coinbase is much more paranoid. (this one is from Rob, waiting for the mods to wave their magic wand on this mod queue)
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:22:59
While this isn't a security question, I feel it's worth answering. I used to be the manager of one of our support teams - and one of our domains was to track social media (twitter and reddit mostly) for opportunities to help people. From a support org point of view these are additional support channels that require some resources to manage, but for us the volume has been pretty low.
As our customer base has grown, and our feature set expanded it's become more challenging to maintain a high level of support via the more popular channels (email and livechat) but we're always working on improvements in this area.
Separately we see some cases here on reddit where customers have a very clear communication history with us via email, and they want to vent their frustrations about the process or a compliance decision. I'm OK with that. Communication is healthy and I've always worked to help people where I can.
I get a bunch of friendly PMs from people on reddit. So while my colleagues at Coinbase sometimes assume the worst about reddit interactions, I've generally had good experiences.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:41:26
I feel like it opens up one more place, rather than providing any focus. It wasn't originally our subreddit. I managed to take control of it and shut it down since it was basically an abandoned mess.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:51:25
Keeping the communication going during an event like this is not easy. Respect.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:12:37
I'll take responsibility for that, since I wrote the email and managed the sending of it. We only emailed customers that required account changes, so I'm not sure what would have caused you to fall through the cracks on that one, unless you were already fine. We also put some notifications on the site for people signing in leading up to the change. Let me know what we can do better.
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:15:22
We currently have upwards of $700m secured in cold storage. The cost of insuring those funds would be very significant. In our view, that money is better spent on continually improving our cold storage solution.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:43:08
We did poll our customers, but not all 4 million. Many customers reached out to us regarding ETH support, and our assessment of other signals also factored into this. If anything, we believe we were late to the game on ETH and wish we'd supported it sooner.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:16:44
The funds in Coinbase’s hot wallet (currently BTC and ETH) are covered by private insurance. Coinbase has insurance policies specifically tailored for digital currencies, from a syndicate of underwriters. This means that even if we lost funds due a compromise of our hot wallet, the insurance policies would pay out and we would be able to cover all customer funds.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:28:36
Yep, working with Theymos now. Looks like he wanted to check we are who we say we are.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:44:30
Coinbase’s hot wallet is insured. This means that Coinbase will be able cover user balances of BTC and ETH, even in the event of a loss of funds from our hot wallet.
You are also guaranteed to receive the full balance of your fiat currency wallet (e.g. USD Wallet). Coinbase stores all customer fiat funds in segregated, custodial accounts with each of its bank partners. Coinbase’s banks and regulators know that the funds held in those accounts belong to Coinbase’s customers - not to Coinbase. Even if Coinbase became insolvent, the funds held in those accounts could not be accessed by Coinbase or its creditors. Rather, the funds held in those accounts would be returned in full to Coinbase’s customers.
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:10:36
This was entirely down to a sudden influx of customers, both new and existing.

That's the old logo... but I still laughed. :)
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:29:10
This change is about supporting the demands of the community. It certainly hasn't been a sudden change of policy, but rather something we have discussed several times in the past and often review as we take new developments into account. Regarding Ethereum specifically, this is a strong platform with a lot of promise. 
Admittedly ETC and the whole fork process of ETH has been confusing for many and this is not something we think has much value for our customers as a buy/sell option on Coinbase. We're providing a way to withdraw ETC, but we won't provide any other interactions with it on Coinbase.

Hiya - support turnaround times for a response are around the 24 hour mark at the moment. When you emailed us, an automated response was sent to you with a case number and indication that your case was now in an open state - but please let me know if you didn't get that case number because then maybe you're dropping our emails into your spam container without knowing it.
I know it doesn't feel great if transactions are getting cancelled, but this is exceedingly rare on our platform since we made significant changes almost a year ago in our transaction handling. PM me the case number, and I'll see what I can do. You case is likely already near the front of the queue at this point though.

Our team learned a lot last week during this huge spike in activity, I guarantee that next time it will be handled better.

We have about 3.7 million customers. 2,500 support requests per week. And 30-ish posts on reddit per week that we respond to. The ratio of active customers to support requests has been improving steadily for the last year as we've continued to make improvements.

The deadline for the changes was moved because we wanted more time to contact people. The requirements are separate for GDAX and Coinbase because of different compliance concerns for the different kinds of activities. We hope that we actually simplified things, by requiring the same of everyone up front when you sign up on GDAX. The only limits on GDAX are withdrawal limits of $10k per day.
I hope that helps explain it.

Probably just the bitcoin network being a bit slow. We don't stop or delay transactions to any bitcoin address.

I'm not familiar with your specific case, but posting on the community forums has zero to do with transfer times to banks. If you didn't get more information than 'we are looking into it' then I'm very sorry, as our agents should be offering a better explanation than that, along with possible alternative solutions and workarounds if there are any options.

To clarify, the roll-out of debit cards as a payment method for our customers was gradual. We started with 1% of customers within the US (not related to state geography at all), then increased to 5%, 25%, and eventually to 100% of our US customers.
We're looking into the 'increase' email you received when your limit changed from $60 to $40 per day. Thanks for taking the time to check out the new payment option!
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:12:51
That does sound a little crazy, I agree. This may be the result of a combination of the recent addition of debit cards as a payment option, along with ongoing improvements to the automated assessment of your limits. Overall the improvements have benefitted most of our customers with higher limits, but there are some outliers where we see negative results. Please contact us if you have concerns, and we'll take a look at your account specifically. Support is the email for help with this.

Thanks for taking the time to explain this and screenshot it. You haven't shown the confirmation step where you confirmed all the transaction details before continuing. What would the desired workflow be here that's different? The completion date is shown correctly for each amount. 
Regarding the '5 minute cancellation window' you've mentioned - it is possible to sometimes cancel non-instant purchases but the amount of time varies and it's short. We are always happy to take your suggestions, thanks for taking the time to screenshot that and explain the issue.

Fair point, I think there's a misunderstanding here. The chart is one put together by Coindesk, and they get the data via the Coinbase Exchange API. There's no special insight on my side about their exact implementation, but I do know the data on the chart is inaccurate as the price never dropped to zero. I will reach out to them and ask about this issue and let you know if they respond.

If you're looking to store larger amounts on Coinbase then definitely consider the Vault wallet.  It adds some additional security in the form of withdrawal delay (48 hours) and multiple email confirmations required for withdrawal.

Regarding the question of being able to check account balances, that's not something we are able to do.  
The USD wallet allows you to buy and sell instantly now.  If you keep some USD in your wallet, you can buy the exact amount of bitcoin you need at the moment of purchase.  And although instant buys were available already, now instant sells are possible too :)

This is an easy one:
Level 1 - $3,000 per day.
Level 2 - $50,000 per day.
Level 1 instant - $100 per week.
Level 2 instant - $1000 per week.
Even though instant requires you to add a credit card, it is not used for the purchase.  When you first add your credit card for instant, your limit will be $100 per week, and then after 30 days it increases to $1000 per week.
If you are based in one of the supported states, you can also add funds to your USD wallet and both buys and sells become instant when using your USD wallet.

Hiya - I don't know your specific case, but I'd be happy to look into it with you.
Recently we found that the workflow for creating a multisig vault on Coinbase allowed people to send bitcoin to an address that, while still being associated with their account, was not going to be supported if they configured their wallet in a certain way.
How is that possible?
During wallet creation on the website, between starting to make a new vault, and deciding whether it would be 1 - a standard Vault (48 hours delay to withdraw, multiple email confirmations required) or 2 - a multisig Vault, it was possible to send bitcoin to the unconfigured vault.
All the bitcoin in these cases is safe and associated with the correct wallet, but it's obviously not the most intuitive process to figure out later. We have fixed this issue, and the affected vaults and multisig vaults (a few dozen) are in the process of being addressed.
I completely understand that this would seem unsettling and confusing. I've been working on contacting customers directly, and would be happy to review your case with you. You can PM me here, or email support and ask to have your case forwarded to me (Michael).

That doesn't sound right, we don't prevent people signing in to update details in this case. Can you please PM me the case number so I can check on this? Please do not PM me your email or any other personal details.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:14:19
I looked into this case specifically and it appears that in the chain of emails between our support agents and yourself the most recent instructions are very specific and clear about the next steps to resolve this issue.
I cannot post the correspondence here publicly on reddit (you certainly can, if you wish) but I can advise that if the recent instructions are not clear, or if you have followed them and now have new information, our agents will be delighted to hear from you again.
It seems very clear what the issue is, and what the resolution is. We'll definitely make sure to help you get there. Please let us know in detail if we are missing anything.

Unfortunately the support queue is a little backed up due to the holidays. Everything will be back to normal on Monday. I'm sorry that you've been caught up in a bit of a holiday slow down after contacting us in the afternoon of Dec 31st. Our average response time for 2015 is between 4 and 8 hours for incoming emails (weekdays vs weekends).

Hi there. I completely understand this must be stressful if the transaction is not completing, or something similar. There's no reason why we would stop you sending your bitcoins to an external address in this situation. And regarding comments about the recent DDoS attack there are no knock-on effects. 
This will take us a little longer to look at over the weekend as we tend to have fewer people working support, but I'll see what I can do. PM me your case number please.
[Edit / Update] We figured out the case details, and we know what the fix is. Seeing now if we can get this done over the weekend.

Hi there. Coinbase provides instant buying capability if you have your account set up for it. You'll need to add a credit card as part of the verification process. You can read full details here:
There's a section in that article about instant buys, and also info on all the other buying limit questions.
Hope that helps!

Hi - I'm sure there's more to this than it sounds like. I'd love to look into this for you. Please PM me your case number. Our response time is usually just a few hours on average so not getting a response may be down to an issue with email or something else.

We read reddit to help customers that post here. It tends to be a single digit number of people each week, compared with the thousands of support requests we get through other channels (email, livechat, support portal, community, twitter). People post on reddit for a few different reasons - email being caught in our spam filter is a good recent example. But whatever the reason, we help in the best way we can. Sometimes we can't get a response back as fast as people like, or we can't help people that have violated our user agreement, but we provide support wherever we can.
Email and livechat are still our primary channels by volume, but the community ( is growing steadily. I'm happy to do some kind of AMA if it would help demystify Coinbase Support.
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:04:49
While we're dealing with this issue outbound transaction signing is disabled. How that will look from your view is that the transaction is pending. When we re-enable transaction signing, all the queued transactions will be processed immediately.

Hi everyone. Some customers are seeing an error on Coinbase.com that appears to show a negative account balance for their BTC wallet. This is indirectly related to current slow site performance. Our team is aware of these issues and we have identified the cause - a fix will be deployed shortly. This doesn't affect actual balances for any customers, but as a precaution we temporarily disabled deposits and withdrawals on Coinbase.com while we resolve this issue.

I take your point, and definitely don't want to upset with posts that might be considered spam. My logic for posting this is to let the wider Coinbase community know that if they live in Colorado they now have access to new features. The emails we send out only reach existing customers.

Many people have the opposite view, that small amounts are good for managing yourself, but large amounts are safer with professionals. Personally I see it from both views depending on the person or company using bitcoin.

Coinbase doesn't have a setup for automatically forwarding purchased bitcoin to another address. If you're technical capable enough it is possible to do this via our API. You would check your wallet balance, and send on the contents to another address. Sorry I couldn't help more with this one. It's an interesting case. I personally use lawnmower.io - it's really cool :)
If you ask over at community.coinbase.com someone may already have done the thing you're trying to do!

Coinbase allows instant buys. If you have a USD wallet, or GBP or EUR wallet in your Coinbase account you can also sell instantly. Plus we have the recently launched 'Instant Exchange' which gives your Coinbase fiat wallet a bitcoin address. Any funds sent to that address are instantly converted to fiat, and this also works in the other direction. 
Head over to  if you have more questions about this. The team will be happy to help you out.

Hi. This seems to have come up a few times in the last few days here on reddit. Trading of currency pairs and access to those on Coinbase Exchange is generally open to the region you're in. UK, EU, US. We're working hard on adding support for more countries and currencies in the future.

This happens from time to time. If a transaction doesn't confirm before the payment window expires then you end up with a mispayment. What's happened? The funds are with the merchant at their receiving address, and they can decide to honor the order or to refund you. Usually you contact the merchant and it's quickly resolved at that point. If you get stuck - like for some reason the merchant support person doesn't know how to handle the situation or how to find the order - email support and we'll be able to give you the information you need to help progress it. We'll do everything we can to help.

We have two payment options at the moment for Canada. Interac and EFT. We had set Interac as the default since this is effectively instant, but the list of Canadian banks that support Interac doesn't cover every bank. EFT should have you covered if you're not able to use Interac. EFT takes a few business days, similar to ACH in the US.

@_date: 2015-07-20 23:19:02
That limit should tick up over time as you use your account. We've switched to this model of starting low and increasing limits over time instead of the less forgiving cancellation process we used to have.

Thankfully that's not the case on Coinbase Exchange. We have always used price improvement, any orders that are mistakenly placed miles away from the target price will execute and match with the highest bid or lowest ask. The fat-finger protection adds another layer of protection for traders.

Seems like this was an issue where the order expired before the funds reached the merchant. In those cases, the merchant still eventually receives the funds. If the merchant is not sure about how to resolve that then it is my hope that they reach out to us for support. I'm glad it was resolved eventually, and I'll follow up internally to ensure we're getting people the right support in future. In this case I see when the response from our team via email is good, but of course being sent packing by livechat wasn't the most productive outcome.

I'm sorry to hear that you've had a poor experience, and that you weren't able to get it resolved with our support team. Merchant cases can be very complex, and it is not always obvious what the nuance may be that leads to resolution for any specific case.

The econotimes site linked is a replay of the altcoins site. Neither of these sites is showing subsequent emails that clarify the refund process.
We definitely did mess up and accidentally charge 25 customers twice for buy orders. We are refunding this immediately and directly to the customer bank accounts. It takes a few days to complete because ACH takes 2 business days (for credits) and this weekend has a holiday on Monday.

I'm really sorry if you felt that our response was generic. This particular feature request has been asked for by others too, and we certainly do listen. For some insight to the process, when this comes in via the support email it will be tagged as a feature request. Then either a new request is created in our system, or this support case is added as a reference in the already existing feature request instance. We are keeping track! This tracking means that sometimes when we release a new feature, we can email all those that contacted support asking for it.
I hope that helps. Again, I'm sorry if you felt like you were brushed off. That's certainly not the case.
Also, the community site has a LOT of Coinbase people watching it compared with reddit. Post your request there to get some discussion going ;)

Not necessarily. You made two trades. If the same participants were part of both trades then sure, they lost what you made. But if different parties only matched one or part of one or both trades then the outcome could be anything.

That's the official list published by Interac for Interac Online supported financial institutions. We've checked against anyone else offering Interac Online and they have the same list available that we do. It's possible you're checking the list for another Interac product. They have 'Interac' and 'Interac Online'.
I hope that helps clarify the setup we're using.

We have a growing base of API integrations by third parties. Those are becoming more innovative and solid over time and we've recently boosted the capabilities of the platform by releasing v2 of our API.
Coinbase is not just buy / sell / store / exchange. There is a lot of room for innovation on our platform. Have you tried Lawnmower.io yet? That's one of my personal faves from recent API integrations on Coinbase.

1 - No. Theymos had recently said that he may ban all discussion of Coinbase from I merely asked him for advance notice if he planned to take that specific action.

Correction - Coinbase is an Exchange:

Through the normal process at we were able to have the existing inactive accounts removed.

You need to fund your account either with your local currency (USD in your case, it seems) or BTC. You can do that directly from the Exchange in the 'Deposit / Withdraw' box from the sidebar on the left.

Cow dung isn't exactly a supported currency on the Exchange. But if you took one bitcoin you'd be able to sell it on the Exchange, withdraw those funds, and buy about 10 yards of grade-A cow dung. But why is it so much more expensive in Iowa?!

To clarify what has happened, there was a technical issue on our side that we identified and emailed some customers about this week. A small number of bank debits were made twice, and this error was identified almost immediately by our team. 
We have contacted the customers affected by this issue, and we're working with them to complete refunds for both the duplicate charge and overdraft fees that some customers incurred from their banks.

Good question. You'll still use your Coinbase account to access GDAX, as GDAX is not a separate company, it's a service provided by Coinbase, Inc. The verification requirements for GDAX are all done up front before you will be able to trade. This should simplify things - once you're onboard you're onboard.

Hi Austin - Does blockstream publish a list of employee accounts posting to reddit and other social media? I briefly checked keybase.io but don't see anything there.
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:59:09
These are good questions.
There are two ways you can do this on Coinbase Exchange.
1 - Make your order a market order. It will be fully matched with the order book up to the amount you specify.
2 - Use the advanced order types. These are listed under 'Limit orders' and allow you to set options. 'Fill or kill' is the one you want.
@_date: 2016-05-12 17:44:56
Have you checked out  where you can set bid / ask at the amount you want? That may be a better option for you over the brokerage side of Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:28:21
'while we can no longer process bitcoin brokerage orders via our banking relationship' That's not wording I've seen exactly, and I'm sorry if it's a little confusing but it means 'you can't buy or sell through Coinbase anymore'.
Usually this would be because of a user agreement terms violation, and I'm surprised that this wouldn't be mentioned in the email you received. If you PM me your case number I'll take a look and see if there's clarification that can be provided.
@_date: 2015-10-01 07:28:15
The terms have always been clear that the referral program can change at any time. Any payments from today will be $10 for each party, and not the $75 from the previous program. Likewise when we changed it from $25 to $75 anyone referrals from the month that it was at $25 were then paid out at $75 during the last few months.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:28:37

Hiya. Thanks for the feedback. I'm sorry if you felt this was sneaky in some way. We communicated the change through twitter, facebook, the website, and the support article on the topic. 
These numbers are very interesting and they vary a lot between professional affiliate marketers. I would love to hear your suggestions for how we can improve the referral program. As expected, we've received a lot of valuable suggestions already over the last few months and we're in a good position to start taking action on these. 
Please let us know what you would like to see by posting on  which is where we'll be collecting feedback.
@_date: 2016-05-22 06:14:13
Thanks for providing the case number, this is very helpful and allowed me to look into your specific case. I can see that we emailed you about 15 hours ago with a brief explanation. For additional clarity and to help everyone else here on reddit understand the issue better - refunds are in process, and unfortunately they started at the end of the week and the banking system stops on weekends. 
Refunds will take time to complete into your account, probably finishing on Monday. They will arrive, as we informed affected customers via email. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:07:56
The support article was created around the same time I made this reddit account. Nobody asked for proof until yesterday so I had never linked it on reddit until then.

I definitely have no concerns about your reddit username, as someone pointed out already that reddit has completely open name spaces and whatever you call yourself here has nothing to do with Coinbase.
Craig (the one that does work at Coinbase) publicly apologized for the confusion. Hopefully that's the end of it.
Here's a list for anyone that wants to check:
To be clear, nobody as Coinbase asked any mods to ban you. That was the actions of the mods at r/bitcoinmarkets, which they have since resolved by unbanning your account.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:19:42
Using Coinbase it would all be converted automatically on the fly for each transaction. $50k worth of transactions a month is not a large volume for us. We'd love to discuss this more with you - come and visit the communit forums here: 
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:55:32
Howdy - We have a couple of places that you can check that might help:
1 -  That's our status page which gives a pretty good indication if there are serious problems.
2 -  That is our discussion and help forum where you'll find many Coinbase employees at hand to answer your questions.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:03:21
I completely agree. For the longest time I was posting here with this account and nobody ever challenged me. As someone in the crypto community I found this perplexing. However we do have a regularly updated article that lists these accounts, and recently some of our team have started using keybase too. The official Coinbase keybase account only 'tracks' employee accounts. That's two paths for verification now. Now that I'm writing this, it occurs to me to include keybase info and links in the social media article. I'll get on that.
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:58:16

We take that as a serious suggestion, but which state are you in? One of the options we're exploring is the ability to have view-only access to Coinbase Exchange if you are in an unsupported state.

@_date: 2015-10-01 07:29:19
That's fine, it's Coinbase Exchange that we added support for and the USD wallet. Before that change you would still have been able to buy and sell bitcoin without any problems, but not access  for trading. Happy trading! :)

The price is entirely set by what people are willing to pay. You can set the price yourself on GDAX by placing a buy order for any price you like. If someone else likes your price and sells to you, that will be the price of bitcoin at that moment.

Simply put, we can't support your business. Brian explained that in a well articulated way. We're definitely sorry that we can't support every business or individual.
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:07:38
Hi there. Yes, you will still be able to use Coinbase and GDAX as a Canadian customer, but without support for the CAD currency. On Coinbase this means you will be able to store and transfer BTC (and soon ETH) and on GDAX this means you will be able to trade ETH/BTC and store and transfer both ETH and BTC.
We're not abandoning Canada, we just can't process or store CAD as a currency because Vogogo is shutting down that part of it's business.
@_date: 2016-07-12 21:06:12
It should now be working for everyone. Response times are back to normal and we're just tracking to make sure it's solved permanently but it looks good right now.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:32:34
This is definitely something that is talked about a lot internally. We are discussing and planning new features for Coinbase Exchange, and we'll be seriously considering responses on our community page (linked by OP) as we prioritize those new features.

I'm happy to personally follow up on this. Please PM me.
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:46:27


Respectfully, I think you have misunderstood what is happening. The URL above is not the one used by individual employees at all. An individual employee used their own personal referral URL, which is in the format of  (mine is /moonbase for example). 
That employee placed ads with their own funds, and hope that people will sign up after finding their way to Coinbase via those ads.
Separately, since you have put that employees personal details in this thread I will be reporting your submission for violation of reddit standards.
@_date: 2016-07-12 00:25:19
While there are other options for future support, I don't have any kind of timeline at the moment for when those would be available.
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:50:39
This wasn't a Coinbase listing. This was paid for by the individual employee.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:47:12
We have a support article for the USD wallet here:
I'd be happy to make some changes based on your feedback. There's mention there of the funding process already. Let me know what improvements we could make there. I think a lot of people are not aware of the support portal which currently has about 180 articles on various Coinbase and bitcoin related topics. Plus we have community.coinbase.com.
@_date: 2016-07-08 00:22:24
I don't follow. There's no way I would encourage anyone to throw away money.
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:39:29
All referral links, all four million, redirect and display /join as the URL AFTER you visit them. This doesn't prevent them from working correctly. OP is wrong, and now the Merkle is wrong too. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:10:25
You will still be able to access trading on GDAX for the ETH/BTC pair. No CAD required for that.
