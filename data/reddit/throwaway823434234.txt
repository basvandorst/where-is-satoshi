Wow. You do realize that there was 17 (at least) Zero Day Vulnerability found in the Nash Exchange during a recent audit by the Infosec community. 
**In particular, but not concluding, you understand the inherent risks listed hereinafter:
§ Risk of Software Weaknesses: You understand and accept that the underlying
Software, the Nash Exchange, the Smart Contract System and other involved
software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early
development stage and unproven, why there is no warranty that the process for
receiving, use and ownership of Crypto Assets will be uninterrupted or error-free
and why there is an inherent risk that the Software and related technologies and
theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the
complete loss of Crypto Assets. You agree not to hold the Company accountable
for any related losses.**
§ Regulatory Risk: **You understand and accept that the blockchain technology
allows new forms of interaction. There is a possibility that certain jurisdictions will
apply existing regulations, or introduce new regulations addressing blockchain
technology–based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the
Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications
of the Smart Contract System and/or the Nash Exchange, and/or the business
model of the Company, including its termination and the loss of the NEX token,
respectively Crypto Assets.**
§ Risk of Abandonment / Lack of Success: **You understand and accept that the
Nash Exchange may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including, but not
limited to, lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, or lack of commercial
success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects).**
§ Risk of Theft: **You understand and accept that the Smart Contract System, the
underlying Software, the Nash Exchange, other involved software, other technology
components and/or platforms may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other
individuals that could result in theft or loss of Crypto Assets.**
§ Risk of Blockchain Mining Attacks: **You understand and accept that, as with
other cryptocurrencies, some blockchains used for the Smart Contract System are
susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks,
majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks.** 
Any successful attack presents a risk to the Smart Contract System and the
expected proper execution and sequencing of Crypto Asset transactions.
That's fucking worrying! lol. They basically say THEMSELVES that **"You understand and accept that the underlying Software, the Nash Exchange, the Smart Contract System and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early development stage and unproven"**

It's Bitcoin == Scam!

Without a doubt, He's not the first and certainly wont be the last. 
All the big exchanges are big because they allow fraud, and fraud is the only thing left in this market.
Running away from the madness is smart, but he won't be able to hide forever. Honestly surprised he has been able to hide this long.
These people have so thoroughly destroyed crypto that I have to think it was planned.

Sadly it's the same with most exchanges.

In Switzerland we have Bitcoin Vending / Selling machines. Muhahaaa. They never are filled up with money (The owner company "Värdex" says always: they will be filled up soooon).
Sometimes you can buy a bitcoin or two. But if you want to sell them, the machine says: Please come later, technical problems. No money back...
A transaction with this machine takes multiple hours. If the machine functions, you lose at least 1000 $ for transaction costs.

When you've no clue what to do, you turn to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:54:17
Desperate for cash, they're hoping that $$$ comes into the exchanges after a light volume fluff job.
Something is coming down the pipe that is nasty. You won't get your money out of these "exchanges" in a panic. Have you considered that?
@_date: 2019-04-03 07:47:49
lol, People who cant afford Bitcoin go into the shitcoin market thinking they can make it big time. It's human nature, hurd mentality. Yes. Yes they are.

Note that that last candle was the same size as this one was on the day Tether and Bitfinex got subpoenaed by the CFTC.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

There were a bunch of April fools articles pretending that BTC ETFs were approved.  Possibly set off the algos (or confused humans)?

Everybody is out of bitcoin and the exchanges just manipulated the price to lure idiots in who believe it will go back to 20.000 
And once enough idiots are going in, they'll sell as much as possible.
And if nobody gets in, they'll try to ramp it up again.
And as there's so many idiotic millenials who still dream of the get rich without effort scheme, my money is on a crash.
 
AND I'm pretty sure the bitcoin paid pumpers will give it another "missed rally, once of a lifetime" salespitch on it.
he pump originated on Bitfinex. This is the deployment of fake money Tethers. They have printed some 400 million of them in the last few months with minimal effect on the price. Guessing they were waiting to use it all at once without having a single big print anyone could point to to show the obvious fraud. Sneaky sneaky.
Too bad the idiots don't know how markets work. Sudden boners like this one are obviously not organic.

In a world of so called smart investors... hasn't anyone figured out that this is a "PUMP AND DUMP" scheme?
It's like watching these people with blockchain tech moving into MLM's now... a total fraud.
Crypto's are a complete fraud - take it from someone who's been in them for the past 3 years heavily investigating and have reviewed hundreds of them. Many if not most of them are a TOTAL FRAUD and this is clearly a pump and dump from a few at the top. Blindem and Robem - it's all sooooo simple when the entire establishment is utterly destroyed of any credibility with no one to hold anyone accountable for any real crimes.
These criminals who are doing this are very wealthy, this is without a doubt an inside op to juice bitfraud here.

Come on people. This is so obvious.
The biggest stable demand for crypto is implosion of fiat
Zimbabwe (premium of Bitcoin there massive)
Argentina in 2013 (you would talk to cab drivers about Gold they would answer crypto (that was an eye opener to me when I went there). Easier to procure, and no metal detector can prevent you to leave with your money-- unnlike Gold)
Venezuela (Very much in use to evade the hyperinflation)
Now Turkey.
The speculation , big money is NET-NET a wash, the real demand is emerging markets people protecting themselves.

The noobs in crypto call it accumulation. I watched the spoofers on Bitmex (40% of BTCs volume) ladder bids worth 5mm each on March 26th and again on April 1st but this time with 9mm bids laddered every $10. Now those $9mm bids are trying to support the new price &gt;$4700. This market couldn't be more fake. The absolute best thing that could happen to these petulant millennials is new lows this week.
