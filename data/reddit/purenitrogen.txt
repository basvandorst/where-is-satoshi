How do you prevent the card from being used after selling them? The FAQ says you debit them, but then how do you generate them on coinforcoffee?

Some teachers.

The posts I'm seeing in that thread didn't seem in favour, was there more discussion I might have missed?

Musical group?

I disagree with him. I find everything I need on Amazon.ca cheaper than I can from other retailers. And they've expanded prime to Canada if you're a student.

Is it worth reading through Atlas shrugged? I got about 500 pages in but I don't think I even understood what was going on, but it has been years and I'm more well read now.

I like the way you abbreviate the exchange into gox mountain =)

Switching to a more powerful pool gives higher chance of success.

Ah, I wasn't aware you could do balance transfers on gift cards. Thank you.

You mean you think he spent 400,000 bitcoins on servers, hits, rent, and coffee?

I believe you're still supposed to declare your foreign income and can be taxed on that if your residence is still American.

Real growth and adoption from major corporations will require some real dumbing down of bitcoin. It's not assuming people are idiots exactly, but more that the average consumer probably reads the headline and makes up their own story.

I agree, but given the prevalence of bitcoin at the moment compared to credit cards, to say 40 million people could have been protected is definitely sensational. And my knowledge is limited here, but we aren't 100% certain of the security in bitcoin yet, as it is still relatively new.

It's sensational because it's a stretch. If targets servers weren't compromised their customers would be secure too. Or if they used cash. Bringing up bitcoin is sensationalist.

According to this coinmill website, it's 4.24 US. Pretty standard for a latte at starbucks or any sort of coffee shop..

To someone who doesn't understand bitcoin, that title looks like using "bitcoin" would prevent credit card information theft.
