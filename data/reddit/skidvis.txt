It was quicker to implement for this test of Apple's bitcoin-blocking. I'll be adding features, including that one, in the next few weeks. ..assuming they don't block it.

Yea, I've heard a lot of "Apple is banning!" but not much from wallet-makers explaining why, with the exception of that Rule 22.1.

You, sir, are my hero. I welcome all the ideas!
1: A pin? Easy enough.  
2: The password is the only way to see/change the seed. It is also as the key to encrypting things.  
3: yea I tested with random words during development, but 12-word entropy is a lot safer than a few words.  
4: The app only gets the current BTC price on load, so if you rush to check an address before it's loaded, you'll see that.   
5: Scanning paper wallets? Sweeping the balance of a paper wallet into an address? Doable.  
6: oh yes. I used bitcoin://address instead of bitcoin:address, my bad.   
Thanks again for the suggestions!

A password of your choosing is needed to get to enter a seed. No one can enter/view/change the seed without the password you created.
The next version will allow for the MPK to be entered instead to alleviate this concern. This was a quicker way to test if Apple would block it.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:42:10
I'll take them!
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:46:24
The private keys are only generated during the initial creation of the public addresses, but that step requires your password (the app only saves a hash) and they are not stored anywhere, only the public addresses go to local storage.
But yes, now that it's live I will update it to allow the MPK.

Yea, that makes total sense. I had the same question myself. Although bitaddress is creating an address offline, it's not just any random number, it's a mathematical result that adheres to the Bitcoin protocol. It's a perfectly valid address because it's one that **can** be a part of the blockchain. When you send money to it, then it actually **is** a part of the blockchain. 
You're probably also wondering, *"Soooo, this random number, can't someone else also randomly get it from bitaddress?"* ..and I'm glad you asked! 
Yes. It's completely possible. About as possible as you getting picked up by a tornado at the beach and getting hit in the eye by the **exact same speck** of sand that hit you in the eye when you were a kid playing outside on a windy day. It's not impossible, but ridiculously improbable. Ask anyone here and they'll be glad to present more astronomically unlikely events that have a better chance of happening. It's like our own version of [The Aristocrats joke]( I suppose. 
Anyhoo.. I saw that you also had some curiosity about public and private keys and what makes them so safe, so here's a really simple video that helped me grasp it.
Hope I helped.

The big thing, I think, is you don't want to keep LARGE amounts (anything that'd make you cry if you lost it) 
on any online wallet (coinbase, blockchain), put that on several paper wallets: 
* coinbase has them: coinbase.com/paper_wallets 
* blockchain has them under Import/Export
* go to  and make them (offline, of course)
* OR buy a cool one from me at 
Keep a small amount to spend on coinbase or blockchain.
If you're technically savvy, (feel comfortable playing with Linux), a common practice is to keep your big bucks in an offline wallet using either [Electrum]( (or [Armory]( 
* 
Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions. (about Bitcoin, not like, nuclear thermodynamics.)

This is what we like to call "bad comedy." 
you see, my car stereo has a usb port so I can connect a flash drive full of music. That little thing you see plugged into it, however, is a [USB Block Erupter]( and they are/were  used to mine bitcoin [or as hand-warmers, they get really hot]. 
They really aren't that powerful, and not worth using unless you have a bajillion of them and free electricity. I plugged it into my stereo as a joke because it's otherwise worthless and I got it to learn more about Bitcoin mining. [what? I did!] 
Note: They're ridiculously selling for $50-100 online, don't pay that much for one. Two months ago they were practically free inside Cracker Jack boxes. [no, not really, but you know what I mean]

I can say I don't have the private keys stored anywhere other than the bill itself, which is the truth, but as with everything Bitcoin, buyer beware. 
These paper wallets are not mean to have large amounts on them, they're just an introductory wallet to help people understand what value lies in Bitcoin and not in paper money.
I like your idea of customer-sent keys, though.
