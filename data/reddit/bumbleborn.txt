it seems like a giant scam 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:17:47
i’m well aware; bought something on purse from eth to btc and it costed me like $15. on the bright side it took like 10 mins
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:11
you’re probably thinking of eos 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:55:28
how so
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:58:47
it also doesn’t exist yet
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:37:19
you would have to buy it anyway and immediately rebuying with fiat would further adoption and not reduce btc stack
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:37:42
not yet in the us at least
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:16:41
please don't ban me mods, i'm not anti btc in any fashion and i feel like both currencies fill valid needs 
bitcoin cash can't really be called an altcoin, it shares a large portion of a ledger and is the third largest crypto by market cap. it is the superior coin currently for market transactions and use as a currency whereas bitcoin has a much larger community and developer support making it superior as an asset or commodity. 
this could change in the future, but as of now it makes no sense for btc to be used over bch as payment for items, the fees are just too high

whoops i don’t frequent nothing against btc but all my money is in eth
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:25:07
or you know replay protection
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:17:32
are you paid to be malicious, uninformed, and annoying? you can respectfully disagree with me and tell me why i’m wrong and i’d listen and possibly change my opinion but when you do this it just makes me reluctant to listen to you further.

jesus christ the toxicity level in cryptocurrency subs is so high relative to the rest of the website 
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:22:12
yeah lmao crypto is cool and shit but lets be real here, 99% of europeans have no reason to use crypto over cash or card in its present form
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:53:12
the chain is immutable but a new chain can be created and accepted by the majority at any time. it’s the same with btc and bch, if a majority switched to bch then most people would consider bch bitcoin and btc bitcoin classic. just because the change was to reverse a hack and not to perform upgrades to the network doesn’t hangs that fact

even as a store of value, why high fees? there are tons of valid scaling solutions that we don’t implement not due to technical problems, but for political and social ones. the goal is to improve over the current system, if you could send a bar of gold across the world for $5 or $0.20, which one are you going to choose? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:28:54
as a user, all i see when i want to pay for something in bitcoin is the extra $2 i’m going to have to spend over using my debit card 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:28:08
lightning will help, but on chain scaling solutions are probably also necessary for one off transactions 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:09:57
it’s still far too much for everyday transactions and could be significantly reduced for store of value use as well, it’s just value taken out of the hands of the users of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:06:02
this is exactly the point i’m trying to make, just because i see problems in btc doesn’t mean i’m promoting a shitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-25 08:59:39
i use ethereum and bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:47:43
diversification is always good
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:57:30
that’s bitfinex
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:00:46
are ethereum/other alts coming soon?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:01:18
as one of those high school teenagers, we’re an exception not a rule. i’ve tried to talk about btc and eth to some of my friends and they call it drug money. probably a generation or two to go 
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:51:21
because forced austerity is fucking stupid
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:37:51
wooosh 
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:06:27
i dont understand how one can rationally disagree with the premise that money supply has some effect on production, unless you’re a “every person is rational all the time” capitalist utopian type.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:07:01
bruh i’m a crypto investor also, it’s just deflation is dumb
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:39:25
i’m going to get crucified for saying this but bch is the fourth largest coin and has pretty cheap fees, ethereum was mostly what i was looking for, you guys are on top of it. 
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:42:18
psychology dawg
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:46:36
you really lack a fundamental understanding of currency. inflation is good. the devaluation of the dollar has little to do with its standing as a currency presuming it doesn’t hyper inflate or hyper deflate.
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:42:59
you know you can invest in currency right
