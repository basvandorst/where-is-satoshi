Thanks for this! This is fascinating. Simple on the surface but very subtle.

This is literally an article about a reddit post from like yesterday. It's not additional confirmation or even a secondary source.

Hypothesis: Mining pools will decrease due to fewer rewards, causing it to fill up again. If a slight decrease in demand is enough to allow it to empty, a slight decrease in hashing power (before a difficulty correction) may be enough to fill it back up.

Thanks! This is useful. Would this mean the merchant would have a lightning wallet as well, to receive bitcoin payments?

I've had no trouble buying bitcoin; it's getting Canadian money back after selling it.

exchanges will also charge fees.

1. You need the address of a wallet you control. This may mean creating a wallet on a public website (blockchain.info, maybe? Not a recommendation, just an option); creating a wallet on a phone app (I use and have used coinomi and mycelium; I hear electrum is good too.); or some other service which generates the public address and private key each wallet needs to function.
2. Dunno, never used "send to a contact". I would only trust sending bitcoins to a wallet (to a wallet's address, specifically), even if it's a friend's wallet.
3. Ledger or other wallets have no bearing on how long a transaction takes. A ledger or other hardware wallet simply stores the public address and private key of a wallet in a more secure, personal way than, say, a phone app or a public website. Transactions are confirmed when a miner decides to take the unconfirmed transaction, put it in a block, and add it to the blockchain. This may be within minutes or hours depending on many factors, such as mining fees.
4. With any wallet, if you lose it, it's gone. Really get this concept: a "wallet" is a combination of a public address (just numbers) and a private key (also just numbers.) It doesn't matter how those numbers are stored, and if you know the numbers you can put them into any wallet app or software and get access to the bitcoins in that wallet. The balance is easy to check: given a wallet address, go to blockchain.info or a similar website and just type in (or copy/paste) the wallet address. The bitcoin blockchain is public and distributed, so everyone has access to the info about every wallet's balance.
5. I've never had a hardware wallet, so I can't answer specific answers about how it stores the keys and such. If you have your 24-word key you can probably recreate the wallet on another device. For me, I was able to move bitcoins from one wallet app to another by using the word-based passphrase, since both wallet apps supported the same recovery format.

wow that rocket is not to scale. Like, he's literally straddling the Saturn V's upper stage. IT'S MEANT TO HOLD MULTIPLE PEOPLE INSIDE IT. Christ.

Well, I wasn't try to make stuff up. I was basing my assumption off of the charts on Blockchain.info. I kinda figured it was like the blockchain itself -- nodes would relay transactions around or something.

There may also be a difference between what Coinbase charges to buy from them VS filling a sell order someone else has placed on their exchange. That was the case with CEX.IO, at least.

Very recently the difficulty got too high and miners switched to mining BCash instead, since it was more profitable. Even so, bitcoins kept getting mined and eventually the difficulty corrected itself.
If the cost got to $1000USD ... I think many bad things would have to happen for that. However, I also think many miners would still stick with bitcoin mining out of responsibility and because the relative reward would still stay high. Less competition means better ROI when/if the price returned.
You can also look at what happened to the difficulties during the past few crashes over the years. Bitcoin has seen many "large" crashes in the past.

In some respect, it's like how merchants can accept USD, Euro, Yen, or other currencies: adoption, support, whether they can use them in their supply chains, whether they trust it, etc.

The first 3/4 are nice. Then you have a bunch of unrelated bullet points that don't really seem, to a layperson, to be related to the purchasing power or the printing of money. "What does cryptography have to do with inflation?" "What does verified without an intermediary have to do with less milk for $0.09?" etc.

Oh, okay. I thought you meant the s2x fork would've broken the Bitcoin network. Cool.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:48:18
Can you explain further how s2x would've crashed the whole network?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:54:26
in my case, my phone wallet client doesn't support it, but the wallet app itself is very nice to use and I don't think it's worth it to switch just for segwit.

This sounds exactly like crazy right- and left-wingers telling the population to ignore media/experts/reason/facts and instead believe the most charismatic or charming person.

Congrats on owning $400 of bitcoin! What are you going to do with your $350 of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:23:01
That rule is a little naive. What about climate change?

"not for predictions"
Oh really? You put the lines in extending past the present into the future for a reason. It's not a legal prediction but what is the point of this chart if not to suggest
A) that the price is still consistent with a logarithmically increasing price, or
B) there will be a price bump after the next halving?
