We need a world like them
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:16:53
Can someone explain what is segwit and segwit2x? which one we should adopt? How this will affect the different parts? Will this benefit hodlers, traders, miners or exchanges? How much will this centralize bitcoin?
How much bandwidth will people need in order to run full nodes?
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:34:31
what about bitcoin.org? is it biased too?
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:34:28
yeah it sounds like some kind of weird zoophilia to me
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:32:23
did your employee pays you a fixed income in bitcoin or the amount of bitcoins you receive each payroll is different?
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:16:12
What kind of dev are you looking for? I know some devs that are interested in accepting bitcoin for work.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:47
yeap, and at $100 too and when it reaches $1 I will buy 100 of them.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:12:48


@_date: 2018-01-17 19:06:44
Me too. I bought on 15k and again at 10k and will buy again at 5k if we ever go there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:45:30
Can you give more details please
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:21
But if nobody do transactions in their version of the code it doesn't matter right?   
Now, what if they also bribe some major exchanges to move to their version of bitcoin?  Can individuals running full nodes stop them? even if most of transactions are in the new version now? at what cost?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:24:19
Which ISP doesn't have a monthly bandwidth cap in the US??
I have Webpass, Very good speed but not sure about cap.
Has someone run a full node with webpass?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:00:08
I feel that most users don't have a say since they just trust 3rd party services and don't run their full nodes. I'm afraid that those 3rd party services which facilitate transactions has maybe too much power.  Even more than mining cartels. I would like too see mining more viable for the average user so people has more incentives to participate and run full nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:11:41
Thanks!  
Do you have numbers of how much kw/h cost to run a full node? I think it will depend of the hardware? let's say is a raspberry pi 3.  
And how much kw/h costs to run a miner?  
Why a miner consume less bandwidth than a full node?
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:33:11
Most people i personally know and they use reddit will take them 4 years or more to save 4000usd.
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:32:07
this one deserves to be higher.
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:35:26
I would like to introduce the ***Lucho (LUC)*** unit of account.
1 Lucho = ฿ 0.0001 = 100 μBTC = 10K Sat
10000 Luchos = 1 BTC 
At today Bitcoin price 1 LUC = 0.39 USD
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:39:19
I also want to introduce the ***Mucho(MUC)*** unit of account
1 Mucho = 10000 Bitcoins
@_date: 2019-03-07 00:41:57
* 1 Satoshi
* 10 Satoshis
* 100 Satoshis
* 1000 Satoshis
* 1 Lucho = 10,000 Sat = 100 μBTC (microBitcoin)
* 10 Luchos = 100,000 Sat = 1000 μBTC = 1 mBTC (miliBitcoin)
* 100 Luchos = 1,000,000 Sat = 1 cBTC (Bitcent) = 10 mBTC
* 1000 Luchos = 10,000,000 Sat = 10 cBTC = 10 Bitcent
* 1 Bitcoin
* 10 Bitcoins
* 100 Bitcoins
* 1,000 Bitcoins
* 1 Mucho = 10,000 BTC
* 10 Muchos = 100,000 BTC
* 100 Muchos = 1,000,000 BTC
* 1000 Muchos = 10,000,000 BTC
* 21,000 Muchos = 21,000,000 BTC

You will certanly lose, for sure
@_date: 2019-10-10 23:33:07
What would you say is the best way to go full in bitcoin? Do you buy in localbitcoins, in a dex, in an mainstream exchange with kyc or bitcoinATM? Or do you mine? Or do you get paid in btc?
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:31:30
180k can be life changing money if you are broke and about to be homeless.
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:39:02
Not sure why you got downvoted. 
This is the fucking true.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:58:24
I am not sure what you mean. I prefer ancient and middle age history and I don't know much about the 19th century. But what i'm sure is that 19th century worker didn't have the technology we have today. A direct democracy would be imposible a century ago. But now we have blockchains and mobile phones so it can be possible. You dont need representants anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:33:34
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:36:15
Oh i agree that education must be a priority in order to a direct democracy to succeed. But I trust that the citizens in a direct democracy will make education more a priority than politicians. Politicians usually don't have interest in invest in education. Is not good for their status quo.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:25:03
If most users in your exchange are using stop losses then yes.
But I don't think most people use them at all.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:42:23
I just found this and thought it would be good to share it here.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:33:36
Actually one of the problems the current system has is that most people don't care about politics. People just trust in politicians and then they fuck you.
Giving more power to money and less to politicians can make people care more about where their taxes goes and hopefully make them act according so they don't get rekt by other organizations.
It feels more democratic to me IMHO.
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:12:36
Good Bot!
  
Does this also means that Arizona will pay tax returns in BTC if asked?
@_date: 2019-01-31 22:36:37
This is the right answer.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:18:10
In a volatile market like this i think stop losses are pretty dumb.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:22:49
Lol. You are right. Im pretty new anyways just trying to learn. Good chat.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:54:39
True. I compleatly agree. This won't change it. Nothing have ever changed with changeorg i believe. My hope is that maybe with enough votes more people will aknowledge the problem. Knowledge is the first step for real change.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:06:50
Don't put all venezuelans in the same bag. 
The problem is their governors.
@_date: 2019-01-31 22:43:28
This! I totally agree.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:42:22
Not everyone has one, but more people has smartphones than people has bank accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:29:05
Link plz! That is interesting
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:17:40
We need this. Merchants should start offering discounts to people paying with BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:41:07
But to make gold coins you need gold metal and that can only be created by supernova stars explosions
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:53:07
This makes me think that it is as much important that employees accept being pay on bitcoin so business can accept it and then use them to pay salaries at least. 
In some states and countries you can pay taxes and rent with crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:52:31
Decentralized Internet? Can you elaborate on that?
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:18:12
I'm concerned that the last post in is more than 1 years old. I hoped venezuelans were using more btc.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:45:38


This is true.
And even the US dollar has some volatility
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:33:06
Wait wait wait! I am from a third world country.
I know a lot of people without bank accounts but not even one person without a cell phone. Even my grandmother who lives in the most remote place of the world has a cell phone.
If you think people are not using bitcoin just because they don't have cell phones you are totally wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:30:52
If bitcoin goes down to 2 grand for a few minutes you may be the only one who sell your btcs at that low value.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:17:48
Am I the only one waiting for bitcoin to go down to $5000 to buy more?
  
I already bought at 15000 and then bought more at 10000 but i wont buy again until price is 5000 or less.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:30:58
Dude. What i mean is they already have smartphones.
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:45:19
Great news I hope venzuelans can live better life with this. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:25:32


That statement is a fallacy.
Because, most people who has no access to banking, they do have smartphones, and most of them are not using crypto either.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:06:09


that is an 11 minute video. didn't watched it but it can't be that difficult. 
While I agree with yoda about this. Don't let him bully you.
it is pretty cool that people/business are accepting bitcoin even if you need to take baby steps first.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:40:45
Still is a fallacy.
At least consider that more than 1B are kids.. 
Kids under 5 doesn't have phones even in developed nations.
But the large majority of adults around the world already have smartphones even in the poorest countries.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:44:59
why that number?
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:19:37
What do you need to make lobby work?
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:51:32
I don't think the government will give free bitcoin to the people but if they are legally able to trade with it instead of using the bolivar and not be persecuted for that, it is something.
  
But today i read that they are actually being persecuted so fuck it..
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:43:07
Thanks for this.
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:15:24
I agree, it won't happen soon and when it finally happens btc will probably already have "quantum cryptosecurity" or whatever term will be used.
