Who said about buying?! :-)
Buying used is a minefield IMO. How do you guarantee the usage?! I concur they are ridiculously priced though. ~$10K new GPUs are still netting a reasonable output after operational expenses and getting cashflow +ve.

I had to have them reset my 2FA a couple months ago because my phone broke the day I set it up. They were prompt in response and were great with security (had to jump through a few hoops to ensure I am Me). Has the transaction be verified by your payment provider? Validate that 100% and document it thoroughly and get back to them in an objective fashion ... maybe even opening a new ticket to start the paper trail from scratch? I have had transactions frozen by my bank to different locations, not communicated to me, incidentally confusing the hell out of the people I was trying to pay when I raised it with them. Their responses were always get back to us when you have verified the transaction from your bank and deposit location.

ALL of these exchanges are under resourced and firefighting 24 / 7 due to the current popularity of cryptocurrencies... I'm not surprised they are a little shit on the support side of things. For support you have to play the game like you are dealing with an overworked IT help desk - there are always routes to solve a problem, there are always ways to find people to talk to and the solution won't magically occur by being emotional.

I really enjoyed this song and video. Wouldn't go as far as call it an anthem though and I have opinions about the bass line / bass tone. I however enjoy its moodiness.
