I don't want to deal with fiat. I use bitcoin as much as I possibly can :)

I would advise you to wait and see how the high fee problem sorts out. At the moment bitcoin is a terrible way to transfer small amounts of money - something it was created for. A normal user wanting to transfer like $10 to his mate will pay $5 in fees or more. This is a serious issue of the bitcoin network.

One could say Blockstream took over the bitcoin development by hiring Core.

Thank you for your answer! Don't you think a Hub will become a kind of a middleman? Something we have been trying to avoid creating Bitcoin? I worry a lot someday a Hub owner will tell us to pay a big fee and we are all fucked.

If the real Satoshi ever wanted to say hello he would post something anywhere signing his message with one of his private keys. That is it really.

Please tell me I am wrong. You want to pay for coffe and get 3x price of coffe as a fee. How is that shilling? I want BTC to succeed as much as everyone here. But be honest with yourself and see what it looks like at the moment.

I bet they are all buying already. They don't have to tell us they are buying otherwise the price would jump. So obvious :)
