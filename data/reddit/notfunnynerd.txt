Hey ,
Is [this]( eligible for your bounty ?
I've spent 4 days on it, I'm quite pleased with the result.
I plan on releasing the source code on Github, probably tomorrow, because now I have yet to add comments to the code, etc.
The app is fully functionnal, and doesn't even need an internet connection (after the first run). You can filter the places by type, and I even added something that will mark your current position on the map.
Concerning F-Droid and the Play Store, I won't be able to do so. I can't afford the fee for a Developper Account on Google (I know, it's like 20$, but I'm a broke student). Anyone other than me can publish it though... Doesn't really matter.
The other problem is F-Droid : they don't allow developpers to use the Google Maps SDK ... (because it's not considered "free"). So I'm screwed ! I hope it's not a deal breaker though, as I've put some work into the making of this app...
What do you think of it ?

0.3 BTC, 100€ purchase. It's now 300€.

I'm on it ;) I've developed some Android apps before, this idea seems great !
**Day 1** : 
[It's a start](
[Color coded different places (waiting for real icons), added info on click](
I'll continue tomorrow :)
**Day 2** :
Added the opensource icons used by CoinMap. It looks  [better](
Next step is the ability to filter by type, which shouldn't be too complicated.
Added filter menu (upper-right corner) and filter ability (!) : [screenshots](
The filter list needs some design enhancements though.
The app doesn't get data from coinmap anymore, but gets it from an upstream (JSON formatted) source (used by coinmap). 
**Day 3** : Finished splash screen : [screenshots](
Massive changes on the way the app handles filters. It's cleaner now.
[Last set of screencaps](
Next step : make the list of categories more human-readable.
**Day 4** : Done ! See my comment [here](
I hope this is what you had in mind !

Thank you so much ! Here's my address : 18asuEPD8yMyYgJmcDxxX1VYBa1AVTzupF
1. Actually, the listing is not sorted, but that's not hard to implement, I'll do it today. I'll also add the distance (I didn't think about it). As for the directions, what do you have in mind ? Something like "Awesome Place - Category: musicstore - Direction: SOUTH" ? Or, when you click on it, Google Maps pops up and shows you how to go there ?
2. All I can say is "sh\*t". I didn't know "OpenCoin" was a thing... And now I don't know what to do, should I rename the whole thing ? (+Github) ? It *could* be done, but I'd have to think of a better name :)  ("OpenBitCoinMapAbsolutelyNotOpenCoinThingyMap^I_swear")
**EDIT**: Directions are now available when clicking on the description of a place ([commit](

Exactly. On this app, I've spent around 4 hours yesterday, and 3 hours today (and counting haha). And [this]( is the current state. Not so much things left to do, apart from some fixes on design and tidying up the code. If someone work full time on this, 3 days seems about right, if there's nothing too complicated.

OP want an android app. Even with something like Phonegap you won't get the smoothness of a native app.

I bought a nice keyboard with bitcoins 2 weeks ago :) Someone had sent me 1BTC, a long time ago.

I've never used it before, but I guess I could try :)
Each "place" is stored in a Sqlite database, so the actual representation doesn't really matter, switching to the OpenStreeMap framework will be easy, once I'm done :)
Thanks for the suggestion though !
@_date: 2013-09-07 22:14:36
Oh my god, **thank you SO MUCH** !
Seriously, [thank you]( I'm now a real bitcoin user :)
[Here]( how I've implemented directions. When you click on a description, a dialog pops up asking if you want, well, directions. Pressing "Yes" opens up Google Maps' Navigation. Just as you asked :).
As for the developer account fee, seriously, I'll handle it. You've already been so kind, no need to send more BTC in my way. I'm just going to take some time to polish things (and saving some money). But it won't take long. I think it's best if I post it to when it's on the Play Store.
Again, thank you :)

Wow ! I don't know what to say, that would be so kind of you! Thinking about it, *if* I get the reward, it would totally pay for the registration fee... So there's no need really to add $20 on top of it. Your call :)
Also, I'm glad you like it so far.
As requested, I added a listing of the closest places, which can be filtered.
I've recorded a quick demo [here]( Still good ?
~~I'm going to push it on github in a few hours, once I'm done with the code.~~

If you've never used it before, it will be a bit hard. My first time using it was kind of a PITA. Just follow the official getting started guide and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:29:41
Wow, it looks really cool !
But 0.1 BTC for signup is a bit steep (for me). Any chance to get something like a free-trial in the future ?
Anyway, good job :)

What do you mean ?
