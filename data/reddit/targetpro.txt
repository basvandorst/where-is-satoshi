Agreed.  I used to be astounded at how bat-shit stupid so many of the posts were in the reddit crypto subs.  I had a hard time believing that shilling was even a thing, since who would want to take a job that fucked.
When I finally came to understand the degree of shilling on reddit, a lot of things made sense.  First was that, although folks on average aren't especially bright, when you read a post that's just stupid as hell, you can bet there's an angle to it.

If not already mentioned here, the development of computer readable contracts is something a few lawyers have started working on.
I don't know much about it, but my understanding is that they're developing ways to draft contracts using specific terms, definitions, etc. that can then be read by machine, turned into smart contracts, and stored and executed by the blockchain.
I think Pamela Morgan of Third Key Solutions could put you in contact with the right people, if this project interests you.  Conversely, she may also need some help with her legal-based bitcoin startup.

Sometimes a miner finds a block right after the last one.  Therefore, few transactions.  When there's no transactions in a block, it's more likely from a miner finding a block, then withholding the broadcasting of it, while they begin looking for the second block.  This can be profitable to the miner under certain circumstances.  Some call this a block withholding attack.
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:37:47

@_date: 2015-06-05 07:15:51
Yes.  As a protocol for exchanging value, Bitcoin's network effect is too strong to allow other altcoins to take that role.  There's a role for many altcoins to do many different types of things, including holding small amounts of monetary value.  But Bitcoin is certainly the most dominant here, and it seems, it's likely to continue to be so.
I believe the analogy to TCP/IP is valid.  TCP/IP wasn't the best by a long shot.  But it was simple and free, and anyone could use it.  (All traits similar to Bitcoin today.)  Down the road, I expect some better coins to emerge.  Perhaps Monero as an example.  But it seems unlikely any coin will be able to dethrone Bitcoin's store of value.

Conventional fiat comes into existence by creating a debt on the opposite site of the ledger.  Most central banks do this in a similar manner.  A treasury department will issue debt, i.e. bonds/treasury bills which are sold to the central bank.  In exchange, the Fed gives its notes (dollars) to the treasury department.
Every central bank around the world operates in essentially the same system.  A dollar of fiat begins as a dollar of debt.
Bitcoin is different.  It lives its life as an asset, born as an asset.
If Jesus was upset with the money lenders, and by extension, cared not for the lending/debt system, my guess is that he would have been particularly horrified to see whole nations adopt currencies based on nothing other than debt.  At least back in his day, gold and silver were common money.
That's all I was getting at. Hoping to *NOT* start a religious debate.  :)

Correct.  And one of the reasons (if not the primary reason) that horse-race betting (whereby betters are essentially betting against one-another in a dynamically set odds-pool) is legal, and always has been in all 50 US states.
The same is true for non-house blackjack tables (whereby no house dealer is present, and fellow gamblers take turns playing the role of the dealer) is also legal.  In this example the house is simply renting the space and the table for the participants to gamble against one another.
On a contrary note, perhaps the most devastating form of actual *gambling* among the poor, is a lottery—which interestingly, many nations not only not condone, they actively support.

ShapeShift sounds more akin to a money exchange at an airport.  If they require AML/KYC in the US, I'm unaware of that.  But as far as the rest of the world goes, no personal information is required and no sales tax is collected.  It's just one currency for another, a receipt, and you're on your way.  I don't think anyone would consider an airport exchange as taking "custody".

Yes.  This is the hard part.
I'd refine precisely how you'd like the site to look/feel and operate.  Sometimes, I draft sketches of what I want the pages, windows, buttons, etc. to look like in advance.  Include a flow chart of how you expect a user would use the site.  Keep clicks to a minimum.  Once you're happy with a basic design, this will make your ideas easier to explain and give a dev something to start with.
Then, I'd come back here and post about it again, with aim of finding dev partners.  In addition, contact (always best in person when you can) Bitcoin meetup groups and college Bitcoin/CS groups.  There's a lot of folks at meetups that are looking to take part in a project.  This would also be a great little project for a CS student to build his resume with.  Be open to sharing credit for the site, and keep an eye out for ways to monetize.

Of course.  In the beginning, I'd start with a 1¢ licensing fee.
Once the platform is proven, i.e. the code has been vetted by the community, and everyone's played their hand at hacking it and it's withstood the attacks, then marketing the value of the code will be trivial.
But first, it needs to be secure, easy to implement, preferably with a mechanism to provably demonstrate an exchange's liquidity reserves, and an architecture that fundamentally protects users' IDs, (even against root access if possible).
Once the code gains adoption worldwide (and I have no doubt it would), there's a bunch of avenues from there to monetize it, as well as earn income from additional services/features.
We're going to live in a world where every nation has dozens, (if not many more) exchanges.  Just as every international airport has currency exchanges today.  Someone might as well start working on a software suite.  It's simply impractical for each exchange to write their code from scratch.

Regardless of whether average block findings are 1 per 10 mins (as currently) or 1 per 2 mins, the difficulty remains the same over the same period of time.
In other words 5 block confirms over 10 mins, is the same difficulty (and security) as 1 block confirm over 10 mins.
For an increase in finding frequency, the mining reward would need to be proportionately lowed as well, but again, it's no big deal.  The same 25 BTC would be rewarded on a 10 min average, regardless to how that time is divided up.
Increasing block frequency would reduce miner pool consolidation, support transactions whereby a milder degree of confirmation is desired over waiting an average 10 mins, and provide better statistical analysis of Bitcoin processes.
The downside is a slightly higher orphan rate.  But I think we can live with that.

People often take issue with that notion.  In my experience, there's never harm in exploring all sorts of ideas.  Occasionally, they can lead to some interesting conclusions, even if the primary avenue of thought is discarded.  Don't worry, none of us want an increased monetary supply.

One example from 1948?  Granted there's been plenty more bad calls since.  I believe even Intrade made a pretty bad call at one time.  But no system is 100% perfect.  And a couple dozen mis-calls over 67 years is hardly a problem.

I'm using the word "bandwidth" here literally.  Not in substitution for throughput or latency.  I think someone else explained it below.


I don't think anyone disputes that an increase in frequency will increase the orphan rate. As mentioned above: "...but since that orphan rate is even distributed among all miners, it shouldn't affect their income."

I'm not sure how absurd this really is.
As you know, the amount of currency physically printed is a very small proportion of the US monetary supply.  I forget how the US calculates this, but it's either M0, MB or Narrow M1 out of the total MZM.  The Fed's primary tool for "printing" more currency is by lowering the interest rate which affects all supply, up to and including, MZM.  By lowering the rate to 0%, they've effectively been "printing" as fast as they can, with limited results.

It's an issue with no easy way to solve and likely won't ever have a solution against a 51% attack, since at that point, that's what the majority of miners are considering "true".  There might be some improvements to the variety of attack vectors leading up to 51% though.

When I pay with cash, I'm never asked for my ID ever.  In any nation.  Furthermore, when I land at an international airport and exchange my currency for local currency, I've never been asked for an ID.  This holds true for value amounts up to £6k.
ID has been required for various forms of payment whereby chargebacks and identity-theft (i.e someone posing as myself) has been an issue, as is common to credit cards.
Even paying by store credits/gift cards requires no ID.
Bitcoin is more akin to digital cash than anything else.  Applying KYC/AML to something like Bitcoin is an over-reach from the historical norm.

Agreed, Bitcoin certainly needs to be able to change and grow indefinitely to remain relevant.  On the other hand, the way in which it grows could open a door, as has happened for block mutability or possibly even malfeasance.  
About consensus, I'm not sure the majority actually do get to have their say. I question how much consensus actually occurred on the March 12th fork.  My guess is that the devs were in consensus, they then contacted several large mining pool operators, exchanges, and any large node-groups, all of whom were probably mostly in agreement, and then the change was pushed, with the average Bitcoin user having either never even upgraded yet to core 0.8, or caught unaware that their 0.8 was now excluded, or running an SPV wallet with no say at all.
How much consensus is there truly among all users if, for example, a few dozen devs took part, and a couple dozen key players from the exchanges, miners, etc. took part, but the body of all the remaining users had no clue?  Do you really think a majority of users participated in the outcome of that fork?  Or were most users dragged along?

Oh lord.  You do realise that the entirety of eBay's useful rep range is from 96% to 100% right?  I.e: you would never want to buy from someone with a 96% rep;  97% remains untrusted,  98% is questionable, 99% is ok; and 100% is good.
They could have just replaced it with an A-through-F grading system or 1-through-5 star system, since that's the end result of how it functions now.
I recall when their algo didn't function like this, as well as the various changes made over the years to it, which were almost all made to satisfy their sellers.  They gave up all granularity to their rating system in an attempt to instill false-confidence in newbie buyers.
eBay could have been great, out-competing Amazon.  Instead, they ended up with just an online flea market.
Lastly, I have no clue what you mean by "the core structure of [their] system is time tested for over 20 years" since their core rating algo has been changed so many times, nothing about it today resembles anything they had deployed in the '90s.
But overall, good work guys!  Just please don't follow eBay's algos too closely.  They really do suck.  Keep it simple.  I'm sure you guys can come up with a better reiteration.

From the post:
Last week, 1 or more parties hacked my Equifax account, set up an account at TransUnion, and ran up charges on a cloned credit card in Brazil. To resolve this, I’ve interacted with the FTC, police, card issuer, and credit bureaus. Here’s what I learned about the credit bureaus:
1. Equifax has no escalation path for security breaches on weekends. Even if a breach potentially affects millions of accounts, there is no way to report it until Monday.
2. TransUnion has no ability to investigate hacks or security breaches. They can only generate a reference number for the customer to file a police report with. (Note that their top product category is Credit Management &amp; Protection.)
3. TransUnion and Equifax do not cooperate on investigations. Despite evidence that suggests the same hacker was at work, neither credit union indicated any interest in even talking with the other.
4. If your TransUnion account is hacked, you will lose online access for life. You will never be able to download your credit report from TransUnion again, and can only get it via mail. For life.
5. Experian displays your mother’s maiden name on your profile page. There is no way to hide this, obscure your mother’s maiden name, or select a different security question.
6. Experian agents cannot view support ticket numbers or track tickets. Only a supervisor can access ticket numbers. Of course, that means you need to talk to a supervisor…
7. Equifax and Experian are extremely reluctant to generate a ticket or escalate to a supervisor. At Equifax, I requested to speak to a supervisor 7 times. At Experian, the agent awkwardly tried to resolve a CloudFlare server error by asking if I was using Internet Explorer. It felt endemic. I did not sense this at TransUnion.
This experience has eroded my naive confidence in the consumer credit system. The burden for prevention, monitoring, and remediation is borne almost entirely by the customer. This doesn’t seem right.

Could be done with a larger QR code, embedding the website, encrypted login credentials, and possibly the payment address.  That way, an initial scan brings up the re-order page with limited access to your account (privacy details still excluded).  If you want to make a change to your physical address, etc. then further login is required.  If you just want to re-order and re-ship to same address, click *OK*, or scan another QR-code thrown up for payment.

It doesn't change the overall rate over a set period of time.  Sure if you have blocks confirming every minute, then the power to over ride 10 would be equal to one today, but you also gain security from a more evenly distributed set, instead of the lumpy 1 block per ~10 min state we have now.
IIRC, the orphan rate of faster blocks was simulated Dave Hudson, and while it increases a bit, it's not significant.
And pools are already not publishing found blocks at times, when it makes economic sense for them to do so, (i.e. a withholding attack).

I doubt Bitcoin would ever become the preferred currency of the black market.
Firstly, it's too traceable.  Computer, phone, internet and GSM/CDMA forensics are simply too good to risk using anything online as a currency.  Physical cash is simply safer and predictable.
Secondly, if for some reason, a digital currency is required, the last coin to choose would be bitcoin.  Bitcoin's architecture is fundamentally based on transparency, with cleartext data sent over the net.

A successful 51% attack has not happened to date.  It's possible folks have tried, but in so doing weren't able to reach 51%.  It buys them very little in doing so:  double spends over a few blocks before they're kicked off the network.  And if they could accumulate 51% of the hashing power, they'd have every incentive to simply continue mining bitcoin, as that in itself is likely to be much more profitable.
If the subject interests you, certain attack vectors open up, at as low as a 20% mining control.  But be aware that this requires actual mining control.  Most large mining "pools" you see on the pie charts are just that—pools.  Made up of several different mining operators, each of whom can redirect their hashing power to another pool at any time (or simply mine by themselves).

But an attacker working on a current 10-min block, has to amass a substantial amount of hashing power, but may be aided by a degree of luck in coming up with a solution.
An attacker working on say a 1-min block will require less hashing power to fork that 1-minute block.  They would require the same hashing power to fork 10 successive 1-min blocks, as 1 10-min block.  But the role of luck is mitigated in trying to fork 10 smaller blocks versus one larger block.  This is the reason it seems faster blocks could be more secure.  (Obviously, this needs simulation analysis to truly vet.)
A slightly higher orphan rate, but since that orphan rate is even distributed among all miners, it shouldn't affect their income.
Thanks for explaining the SPV bandwidth issue.  That makes perfect sense.  And I see that 1-min blocks would likely take up 10x the total throughput as 10-min blocks.  But the headers are really quite small, so are you sure this is a problem?

I’ve PM’d several Redditors about this question now, and so far, haven’t received any replies. So I thought I’d put this out there for anyone who’s thought about it.
I’m trying to get my mind around how consumer lending would work in Bitcoin world.
Certainly, people will always need to take loans, whether for buying a house, cars, a business, etc. But doing so in a deflationary currency (as I expect bitcoin to continue to behave) could prove to be particularly painful, especially over a long-term loan.  I, certainly, am much happier that my home mortgage is in fiat, instead of BTC.
But if large-scale loans, like mortgages, were denominated in bitcoin, what would that look like?
To remain competitive in this context, banks lending in BTC could lower their interest rates, effectively compensating for the deflation. And just as banks estimate the ROI of their loans relative to inflation, they could equally do so, relative to deflation. If deflation were to be particularly extreme, one might imagine a competitive bank offering a negative interest rate.  (Not unlike Switzerland or the ECB have done.)  But this is where this idea seems to break down. Would a consumer-facing bank ever have the incentive to offer a negative interest rate loan, when they could just keep the BTC instead for a higher growth rate? More broadly, can effective lending happen in a highly deflationary currency?
For much of AD history, gold has been a popular currency.  So I can’t imagine that this issue has not been faced before.  But I don’t know what the solutions were, or whether they’re applicable to the degree of deflation, a worldwide Bitcoin currency could create.
Any feedback is appreciated.
TL;DR example:  How to make a 5% loan in a 10% depreciating currency, when fractional reserve lending is seemingly not an option?

I understand your point.  And I agree that that's the fair, logical and just way of doing things.  Unfortunately, that's not how some of the world works.  And it's very specifically not how the US works.
If you were to violate their law (even just a NY law), regardless of where you live, then they may charge you with a crime (whether you're in the US or not).  In fact, if you don't show up for your trial, then you'd be considered guilty by failure to appear in court.
For a small matter, they're unlikely to do anything about it unless you were to fly into the US, at which point they might arrest you at the airport.
For a *medium*-level violation of US law, they'll pressure your government to have you legally extradited to the US, so you may face trial (and possibly a jail sentence) in the US.
For a very serious crime, they use something called "extraordinary rendition" whereby a suspect is basically kidnapped (in their home nation), placed into custody on a private plane and flown back to either the US, one of their territories, protectorates, or prison camps.  To facilitate this, the US keeps such camps, generally hidden, around the world.  As an example, it was recently disclosed that Thailand had one such prison for US detainees.  Depending on your suspected crime, you may or may not be formally charged with a crime.  You may just be held indefinitely.
So your point was that you...


Unfortunately, the US lawmakers (including Ben Lawsky of the NYDFS) disagree with you.  Of course, you're free to do as you like.  Just as the US government is also free to do as it likes.
And they have the money, personnel, political influence, and military prowess, to exercise their own laws as they please, even if their laws affect citizens of other nations.
I don't agree with their laws.  But that's just how they do things.

My thought exactly.  Keep control yourself.  (You can always point the domain to another page in the meantime.)
Build (or ask the community to build) an easy-to-use website that informs newbies of the ways in which they may purchase bitcoin.
The page should first ask which nation they're in; then it should tailor the results from there.
A *"Find My Exchange"* wizard could also be integrated to help new users find exchanges, that will either process their exchange right away, or process larger value amounts, or protect user privacy better, etc.  All depending, of course, on what the user is looking for in an exchange.
Compound that, with an exchange rating system and user feedback comments, and you should be able to provide a valuable resource for the community.
As mentioned, it's generous enough of you just to offer your TLD for this.  Ask if others will pitch in the code you need, and provide the occasional updating.
This would help the community, and also provide traffic through your domain.  Should you later choose to sell your domain, the built-up traffic flow will support a better selling price.

If they understood the protocol, they'd realise it's actually a regulator's wet dream.
The protocol self-regulates in an amazingly fair way.  It's entirely voluntary, open-source, with no person or company owning the code, while supporting a level of transparency never before possible.
For a regulator to be against Bitcoin, means that he sees his job more as a means to control, than to benefit, the users of the protocol.

Partially right.  Bitcoin's value may not "come from" the net, but without the net, Bitcoin's value would be severely impaired, if existent.  In the same way, Bitcoin could potentially hold value without the ability to transact, but its value would then be limited to that of a collector's token.  It's the utility of its transactional use that attracts buyer interest and represents an "inherent" value to its use.  And with every transaction, comes a degree of storage, whether for a second or a year, further increasing value.
The effects of Bitcoin's velocity is a discussion too involved for me to give it the time to address on a forum, but it's quite a bit more complex than you've made it out to sound.  While part of what you said is true (by definition) you're excluding the *effects* of its velocity.
There's nothing to obfuscate.  It just doesn't boil down to a scenario as simplistic as you've outlined.  It's really in the distribution of the velocity that the added value becomes apparent.

How does this relate to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-29 05:21:23
What I took it to mean—and this is by no means definitive—was that like the 12 Mar 2013 fork, the resolution to that fork (read reorganisation) was done by a relatively small numbers of devs outside of the protocol's strong security (as you noted above).
The devs chose to recommend to users that they roll back the core to 0.7.  And thankfully so.  (0.7 contained all transactions.)  Theoretically however, they could have done nothing or recommended users continue using 0.8.
If either of the latter two occurred, considerable transactions would have been lost, and in essence a new history would have been written.  This represents one scenario whereby the ledger can indeed be mutable, although by human hand.  There may be a few other such scenarios.  Bitcoin is still in its infancy.
The key about the above reorganisation, or whatever one wants to call it, is that it presented a situation whereby changes were made to the blockchain that the protocol couldn't self-correct.  Or said another way, it couldn't correct on its own through the normal algos it employs to resolve forks (i.e. that with the longest chain).
The protocol's security may remain incredibly strong, but that doesn't help if the protocol is replaced, or a bug is exploited, or other factors come into play.
I'm happy the devs did what they did that March day, but the fact that such a small number of devs could push a change as sweeping as this causes other concerns to arise.  When multi-billion dollars of people's value is stored within the protocol, we need it to be robust.  One that is immune to even the worst bad actors, devs, miners, etc.
So there's work to do.
The above is just what I gathered from his post.  But who knows; I could have totally misunderstood his meaning.

I've been playing along with you, but you've piqued my curiosity now.  You do realise that "realest" isn't a word right—outside of *Scrabble*, and possibly *Google*?  And that, among with other reasons, is why you won't find it in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, nor in the OED.
Just like "realer" isn't a word.  Using the superlative of a word doesn't automatically make it a word.  If it did, "worstest" would be a word as well, which you've just correctly conceded it isn't.
Yes, if you scour the internet, I'm sure you'll find examples of its use.  As Tupac (referenced above) and several others have been want to use it at times.  Not unlike so many other non-words, which can be put to good use on occasion.  But if you were to write professionally for any reputable journal, using such words, you'd be scoffed at.  Any decent standards and practices desk would make the same comment:  *"That's not a word."*  That's why you won't find use of the word "realest" in the NY Times or the WSJ as examples.  On occasion they may quote someone else using it, or they may use it as a parody/joke, as when the WSJ called *Joe the Plumber* "...this realest of men..".  I won't expect you to get the humour in that, since it's probably before your time, but given the context, he was masterfully described by this non-word to good effect.  Without such context, any editor worth his weight, wouldn't let it slip by otherwise, because editors consider the superlative of real to be "most real".  Apologies if this comes as a surprise to you.
Since you seem obsessed to correct others when you clearly have no idea what you're talking about, I might as well mention as well, that you're also wrong in stating "...you corrected him incorrectly...".  In fact, there's nothing incorrect to my suggestion, regardless of your follow-up arguments.  And that is a fact that you can take with you to any competent English teacher on the planet.
TL;DR: you make a fool of yourself when you go to such lengths to correct someone else, when you, yourself haven't a clue what you're talking about.

Not necessarily.

Only the "they" in this context isn't ShapeShift.  It's the two independent entities that are conducting the exchange.  No different than if a couple folks met on a sidewalk to exchange their pesos for rubles.  Since in this example, the city would own the sidewalk, would you consider the city to now be the "exchange"?

Other countries rarely adopt the same regulations.  And it's unlikely they'll pay particular attention to the regulations of one US state.  However, IF measures like NYDFS's proposed regulations go through, AND every other country adds their own flavor of regulation to bitcoin on top of that, the near frictionless payment environment we now have with bitcoin, will be ground to a halt.  We don't need another Paypal.
@_date: 2014-08-27 04:06:20
The Bitcoin protocol is just a language.  It's something that can be replicated anywhere a couple CPUs can be networked.  Like the internet, no one "runs" the network or is in charge of it, and no one owns the code that runs it.  The original author who imagined the Bitcoin concept has preferred to remain anonymous.
The tokens of exchange are secure, more so than any bank can provide, and therefore can represent a value, which can be anything.
The first and most obvious implementation of this technology was to make a digital "coin" which could be used to represent anything that we'd normally put value on.  As far as its implementation as a currency goes, it can be thought of like a Paypal for the internet—only without the Paypal.
So far, what’s attracted the most attention to the protocol, has been its ability to serve as a digital currency, for which its well suited.  Its characteristics lend itself to work like digital cash.  But just like real cash, it is easily lost or stolen.  Much stronger security measures are in development, which the community hopes will one day make it secure for anyone to use—even my grandma.
However, for all its use as a currency, this is to me its least interesting aspect.
At it's core, the language allows disparate parties, who've never even met, to create a consensus on a given issue.  Something Congress knows a little about how hard that can be.  And it has been, until this protocol was imagined, equally difficult to do so between different parties over a network.
Until the Bitcoin technology came about in 2008, the only way to do this was to trust an (hopefully fair and neutral) arbitrator.  Bitcoin allows direct consensus without this intermediary.  This break-through still surprises me today, as I was fairly certain this wouldn't be possible.
But it turns out, it is possible!  And Bitcoin isn’t a gimmick or a get-rich-quick scheme.  It represents a significant step forward in computer science.  And like discovering a new physics theorem, we cannot un-learn it.  It's something that will influence the way code is written, how things are published, and how things are exchanged from now on.  It will impact numerous industries.
My own interest lies in medical research, and the implications the protocol has to me are fascinating.
Having said all that, it's still a fledgling baby technology, just five years old.  There are a ton of technical issues to work out.  But as insights into the protocol arise, it’s also giving us ways to solve those issues that have never come to light before:  like up-to-the-second provable solvency of an insurance or exchange business, as an example.
The technology at the heart of Bitcoin will improve research, accommodate greater transparency (for non-profits for example), provide for mediums of exchange, provide proof of publishing, and shift how decisions over things are arrived at.  We may even be voting someday in a variant of the Bitcoin technology in provably fair elections.

Well, it's not even a theory really.  More like a wild guess, premised by the fact that BTC-E practices little-to-no KYC/AML depending on the type of bank transfer done through them.  Consequently, many have commented that BTC-E is the go-to exchange for nafarious throughput.  This should generally cause the BTC price on their exchange to be slightly higher than other exchanges, barring efficient arbitrage.  But as pointed out, for the last year+ BTC-E has remained substantially under market.  Which leads me to believe they had substantial selling (of BTC) pressure from within their exchange.  Efficient arbitrage can be ruled out, because now that their selling pressure has been relieved, their BTC prices have not matched the other exchanges either.  That's the mechanics of my guess—but that's truly all it is.

Defining Bitcoin as a financial instrument greatly negates its many other uses.  Furthermore, how do you prevent a cryptographic coin from attaining value?  For Chrissake, even testnet coins occasional build value and the devs have to reset the blockchain to null out the value.
I'm interested in the development of a crypto-coin as a secure method of tracking medical records.  It has the potential to be a valuable service, but what if the cryptographic keys themselves (the tokens, i.e. coins) gain value simply through market forces?  We've already discussed this and realised that we'd have to exclude NY customers from the outset.

@_date: 2015-06-05 06:56:26
I was a bit rash in questioning your sanity.  Sorry.  I actually liked your synopsis;  it's just your conclusion I find completely misguided.
The NYDFS came out with a medieval reg, modified it slightly, and now you consider it "Bullish" news.  Really?  What would you call prison gang-rape?  A physically-intimate encounter with a bunch of young males, whereby they made clear how much they valued your body?
Their reg does little in the way to protect consumers, and everything in the way to protect legacy infrastructure.  Bitcoin itself is an answer to the corruption forced upon folks by the banking industry and their puppets in government.  By itself, it presents the very regulation the DFS should be looking for—if their goal were to be consumer protection.  To forcibly restrict the use of this voluntary protocol does more to harm consumers than protect them.
The regs however shine at widening the moat between big banks (and their hundreds of years of history at ripping folks off) and upstart challengers who come to the space with innovate, provably-fair solutions, requiring no institutional trust.  Bitcoin should be a regulators wet-dream, but they see it as a threat to their existing mechanisms of control, which have proven worthless.
Of the regs many clauses that make accepting NY users completely untenable now, is the requirement to get approval from the DFS before launching new products.  Show me another industry with this level of control, outside the automobile industry.  This clause alone makes it impossible to accept NY customers.  Trying to launch a new product is a pain in the ass.  Of all the hassles of vetting ideas, having engineers debate them endlessly, coordinate funding, deal with all the legal implications, develop sound marketing, get board approval, ***to only then*** have to send all this off to the NYDFS for "approval".  Are you kidding me?  It will take them 6 weeks to 6 months just to reply with an answer.  A successful startup needs to be able to execute a decision in less time than it would take just to explain to the regulators what they're trying to do.
The NYDFS reg is a disaster.  That its final draft is 0.01% less of a disaster makes no difference.  It kills Bitcoin startups trying to launch in, or accept customers from, NY.  That's not bullish, it's bullshit.  And I hope other states don't adopt these measures.

Setup is free.  Using the card costs $60/year.


Are you sure?  If that were the case, why do they charge an ATM fee, and then further cite an asterisk on their pricing schedule that reads:


Lastly, I see what Xapo is trying to do with their card.  And I'm sympathetic to their efforts.  But I hate to break the news that $3.50 per domestic ATM use, just doesn't fly in this day and age.  Unless I misread something:  this means that if one uses their Xapo card once per week at an ATM, that's $241/year.  More than anything, this causes me to question the judgement of their executive management.  Take a moment to contrast that fee to my primary debit card.  No fees, ever.  And my account is reimbursed for any ATM operating or network fees incurred anywhere in the world.
For that same $241/year Xapo fee (if correct), one could purchase $24,140 worth of bitcoin through an exchange and pay the same fees.  This point is made more salient by the fact that to use Xapo, one must possess the bitcoins already (and therefore have already paid the exchange fee).  To be really cynical, the Xapo card may be considered by some as simply an expensive way to get back into fiat.
Xapo should take their group of smart Palo Alto engineers—I know they have them—and go into something with serious potential that's also a blast to work on.  Tons of untapped ideas in the bitcoin world right now—that five years from now—most of us will be wondering, "How come I didn't think of *that*?"  Those are the ideas to pursue.  Not a friggin high-priced debit card.  Come on.  I'm sure the folks at Xapo are up for a real challenge.

Some might argue that.  And they would be wrong.  :)  I jest, of course.
But in traditional monetary theory (and it's anyone's guess as to how well "traditional monetary theory" actually translates to bitcoin dynamics) making:
* 1m transfers of $1 over 1 day =
* 1 transfer of $1m over 1 day =
* 2 transfers of $250k over ½ day
The velocity only increases when the total funds per time increment increases.  When the velocity of a currency increases, it *effectively* increases the supply of that currency.  The more supply of a currency there is, the less it is worth compared to other currencies.  At least, that's the standard logic.
So with bitcoin having a market cap of 6-8 billion, (without taking into consideration the relative differences in velocity to that of other currencies), it's market cap *value* is being underestimated.  In other words, taking the market cap alone of bitcoin assumes it has the same velocity as other currencies—which it doesn't.
If there's a real economist in the room, please come forward and help me clarify or correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm certainly not an expert.
Little history factoid:  certain nations at times have purposefully forced an increase in the velocity of their currency by date stamping their bills, and setting them to worthless at pre-determined expiration periods.

Theoretically 3600 new coins enter the market each day, but since miners have been—on average—beating the estimated 10min/block ratio, it turns out to be closer to 3900 new coins/per day.  (I haven't run the numbers in awhile, so I'm pretty fuzzy on exact totals.)
As far as the number of "re-sold coins", that's basically synonymous with "transaction volume" which you can look up [here](  For clarity, I prefer the log scale (same data), and don't forget that tons of volume is now happening off-blockchain.

What do you mean "No."
"No" to what?  Did you read my question?
It’s a fact that mining is what’s used to distribute new coins and process transactions into the blockchain.  Mining fulfills both functions (as well as securing the network) and some might argue it fulfills some other roles as well.
And of course you calculated:


Of course.  If you hadn’t taken those costs into account, you wouldn’t be calculating really anything of value.
My point was that you summed your costs to total:


Fair enough, but you’re leaving out the entire value proposition that the miners are **also** distributing new coins, of which, initially, they also own, once *discovered*.
Assuming your numbers are right, your post should read something like:


But the problem with saying that, is that trying to place a fixed dollar amount on both those things is extremely challenging at best.
It’s easy to calculate the fixed and ongoing costs of running a mining operation.  And it’s also easy to calculate the value of the bitcoin at the time it was mined.  But it’s very difficult to calculate the value that bitcoin has on a transactional basis, since once the bitcoin is created, it can be used in millions of transactions thereafter for dirt cheap costs.  Take the net present value of that bitcoin for its expected life-span as a unit for exchange, add that to the costs you mentioned in your original comment, and you’re getting closer to the right answer.  Of course, calculating the NPV of a bitcoin at the time of “finding” is a pain in the ass, (likely requiring several studies).  So no one knows what the approximated “transaction” cost would really be.  It’s safe to assume however, that it would be far, far less than $5 per transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:45:46
It's closer to about 3.4 Tx/sec, but that still far too slow for an entire nation to adopt at this time.  However this is a solvable problem, and good coders are working on it.  
This also does not include off-chain transactions, which most exchanges/high-traffic use-cases have already implemented.  With on and off chains transactions, teh network can handle many more Txs than 3.4 Tx/sec.

Regardless of attacking the chain, pre-mining the coins, centrally controlling the chain, or even if it's in the best self-interest of someone to do so, one simply cannot stop someone from choosing to sell their private key for some value.
That was my point.  Unless one excludes users from the possibility of even owning (or controlling) their own key, you cannot ensure market value does not creep in.
Just as it's illegal to sell one's own organs, yet it still happens, you can't ensure one's own data isn't somehow asked or offered for sale.  This wouldn't be an issue if the NYDFS hadn't defined the issue so broadly.
As a developer of a non-financial coin, one must not only not "sell" the coin (obviously), but also risk liability if the coin "assumes" value in some ad-hock marketplace.

Maybe 10-12 years.
Bitcoin's daily transaction volume is growing roughly 4 times per year.  Anything growing at this rate will change the world.
Example, let's say you and I started our own altcoin.  We traded it between each other and encouraged new folks to try it out.  Our coin was popular and the user base began growing at 4 times per year, so after 1 year, we had 8 folks interested.
If things continued at that same 4x rate, 16 years later everyone on the planet would be using our altcoin.  8.6B people.
If current adoption rate continues (which is only suggested at by the transaction volume), then Bitcoin has huge potential.

I thought the Xapo card was a *debit card*.  So who exactly does it allow to pay?  Grocery stores?  Forgive my obvious ignorance here.  I haven't done my own shopping in years, except sometimes online.  And it seems online merchants typically request a credit card number.  I can't recall them ever accepting debit payments (Star, Plus, Cirrus, etc.).


Xapo also announced it would free or near-free, placing it in a very different light.  Their marketing needed to be consistent in this, otherwise they risk getting a backlash effect, to a perceived *bait-and-switch* marketing ploy.


I think Xapo will find you're not the exception here.  Neither would I.

Start small.  Dedicate a small amount to practice throwing funds around wallet to wallet.  Get comfortable using things like changetip and buying locally, etc. Ensure your computer is safe.  One of the biggest problems people have with bitcoin is losing their own funds.  (It's sort of amusing:  the world's most secure p2p payment system is created and it turns out the biggest problem is folks losing their own funds.)  Practice making some off-line paper wallets, etc.  Never keep your funds in an exchange.  Then once you're fully comfortable, just start slowly.  Be patient.  Once you're all set, pick up more coins around the 1st and 2nd order std dev.'s below mean.  Or whatever methodology you feel comfortable with, just stick with it.  Plenty more big dips coming to town.  (Bitcoin's volatility isn't going away anytime soon.)  Be prepared to go long (5-10 years).  Bitcoin is in for some extreme battles, and may **not win**.  If it does win, even a modest holding at today's prices will reap enormous rewards.  Note that any investment in bitcoin should represent the part of your portfolio reserved for extreme high-risk investments.

Love the idea, but I sure wouldn't want to take a loan denominated purely in bitcoin.  Paying it back might be a pain considering bitcoin's growth potential.  (Taking a massive house loan is the *one* thing I love about fiat.)
If one were to set up a business model as you describe, but use something like Coinapult's Locks (  ) to set the *value* of the loan to something less volatile (e.g. gold, etc.) it might work.  Debtors could re-pay via a variable bitcoin amount based on the 'locked' value (plus interest of course).
I think there's already a coin (maybe it's IDcoin?) that's working to link users' personal ID to a public key for various uses like you describe.  So that part of the puzzle may be easier to solve by outsourcing that part to them.

Your synopsis is pretty good.  I know you simplified some things for clarity, and that's totally understandable.  Just a couple FYIs:
The Fed can also be thought of as the lender of first resort, since that's the mechanism for creating fiat in the first place.


There's a difference between inflation and increasing the monetary base.  While the latter leads to the former, they're not mutually interchangeable.  At this stage of the game, the base is being increased.


Agreed.  As you probably know, the Fed doesn't actually physically print bills or coins.  That's basically 'outsourced' to Treasury.  But the Fed, (by what you described) controls their creation.  The Fed has more powerful tools at its disposal for "creating" money, most notably by lowering the prime rate.

Inflation use to simply mean an increase in the monetary supply.  Today it refers to an increase in the price for goods and services.  While the two are related, they're not one in the same, i.e. "inflation" no longer refers to just the monetary supply.
I wish it would since really it *should*;  it would give a much more accurate picture of things.  Instead the US tries to calculate inflation against the CPI, which they periodically manipulate, and exclude a couple of the most expensive things necessary for living: home and vehicle prices.
Bitcoin actually serves as a good example of this principle.  While it's monetary base has been increasing substantially over the last 5 years (and will increase for the next ~125 years), it's usually thought of as being a deflationary currency, since its buying power has increased over the last 5 years.
As mentioned below, with a fixed USD monetary supply, we wouldn't have 0% inflation; we'd have something closer to an averaged 11-12% deflation per year since 1914. In other words, $1 USD in 1914 would have approximately $1m worth of purchasing power in 2014.
That’s the real shame, that the Fed, in its infinite wisdom, chooses to not comment on.
@_date: 2014-09-27 18:51:25
Right.  And apparently I came off sounding like this was a protocol problem, which clearly it isn't.
The problem is this:  blockchain.info's wallet has this problem, iOS's bitWallet takes a confirmation to validate the change, (leaving you BTC-less until that happens), other wallets have either a crappy UI or other issues.  Think Coinbase and Xapo issues, the dozen+ failed exchanges.  The list of non-user-friendly issues goes on and on.
For me, it's not an issue.  I like blockchain.info's wallet, as well as breadwallet.  But for the average Joe, these things cause frustration, annoyance, and sometimes loss of funds.  And guess who the culprit is perceived to be by the average dude?  Bitcoin.  No one said it's fair.  Or rationale.  It's just how it is.
If bitcoin were to magically skyrocket in popularity, the predominant user experience would likely represent thoughts, such as "No one can figure out this new payment processor" or "Another person lost funds today."
If we're going to really advocate this for mainstream adoption, the supporting ecosystem needs to be rock-solid.  Which means, all the various related—but unrelated—bitcoin services need to get their act together.
Failure at larger scales is no fun, especially once the media frenzy get involved (as we've seen with MTGox).  This is the time to flesh out the issues, and bring out the glass sharpening stones.  Public *perceptions* will be less forgiving down the road.

So, after the MTGox *theft* (for lack of a word describing whatever really happened), the price has generally headed downward.
This could be due to countless reasons, but could certainly be true if the ~440k coins are being sold off on a daily basis.  Perhaps with brief intermissions to allow the price to rebound.  Support for this hypothesis could come by way that a hacker would likely prefer selling through BTC-e since it's the most anonymous way to do so, and BTC-e's exchange rate is typically lower than other exchanges.

If someone sets up a fully free-market international marketplace (e.g: Silk Road).  Big deal.  Why should the burden of satisfying any particular legal issue fall on the operator of the marketplace?  It's the buyer's responsibility to keep wihtin the laws that they themselves are subject to.
For example, why should a business like eBay be punished for simply providing a marketplace where a seller sells a bottle of wine to someone living in Afghanistan, where alcohol is illegal?  And if the buyer in Afghanistan breaks their local laws, he is the one responsible to the jurisdiction he is under.  Not the seller, of whom it may be perfectly legal to sell alcohol in his jurisdiction, and certainly not eBay.

Any situation whereby time is a relevant factor in the transaction for starters.
Also, when the value of the currency (and its delivery) is more in question than what's being purchased.  (This is a non-factor in regard to the US and Euro, but in many places, this is critical.  Which is one of the reasons large international contracts are often settled in USD or Euro regardless of the two states making the transaction.)
Also, when delivery of the good or service is non-reversible.  If both parties are happy with the transaction as is, it's adventacious when the currency is irreversible as well.
Also, bitcoin isn't a substitute for fraud protection.  If I pay for something with regular cash and the person rips me off, they can choose to refuse a refund.  I can choose to take them to civil court.  The same holds true for bitcoin.  To me, bitcoin is like digital cash, with all the benefits and pitfalls that entails.
Plenty of fraud occurs as well in the opposite direction, when the product is sound and delivered, but the chargeback is fraudulent (think of what credit cards have to deal with regarding this).  That's not fair to the seller obviously.  Irreversible payment protects the seller in that context, while possibly providing lower fess to the consumer.
Lastly, bitcoin isn't necessarily for the US.  It's kind of a novelty and luxury for Americans and Europeans imho.  In many other places though, it's a godsend.

As a kid, I use to daydream about randomness.  How could you tell when something was truly random?  And was there a way to measure *randomness*?  (*Hint to kids:  this will not help you get laid.*)
When a teacher designs a test, the distribution of answers *A* through *E*  doesn't seem random either.  (At least that's my sense of it from when I was in secondary school;  teachers might properly randomize the answers today.)   It seemed back then, that answers *A* through *C* occurred more commonly, than *D* or *E*.  Furthermore, *lengths* of any one particular answer (such as 5 *C*s in a row), seemed less common than they should have otherwise occurred, even on 100-question tests.  I also felt a slight prejudice represented on the tests towards answer *E* when in the specific context of *E* representing:  "All of the above."  My sense was that teachers seemed to use that a little too often.
“No wonder I guessed wrong so many times!” *kidding*
I didn't pursue maths as a major at college, but in agreement with the article, my guess is that we, as humans, are likely poor at actually guessing random answers.  If the test's answers were truly distributed randomly, then drawing a line through the *A* column, for example, should be sufficient to provide a series of random answers, netting the student about a 1 in 5 score (on an *A* through *E* test).
When the test's answers are not distributed randomly, and a student furthermore chooses answers in non-random way, the resulting effect interests me.  Does it create more or less *randomness*?  Would there be more of a chance at acquiring a 1 in 5 score or less so?  (Assuming full *randomness* nets you a ~1 in 5 score.)  And would doing so repeatedly increase entropy?  Or just shift the distribution from a finer level of granularity to a more coarse granularity, without necessarily affecting the degree of *randomness*?
After all these years, I still don’t have a clue about *randomness*.  Still Curious, but I really don't want to delve into a bunch of classes about it.

* Imho there's never a good time to get in or out of any investment.  It only ever becomes clear in hindsight.  It's a very personal decision, and never let others, no matter how "authoritative" they sound, cloud your judgement.
* Ask yourself, do you believe the bitcoin technology is fundamentally sound?  Are the resources in place to fix problems to the protocol, that will inevitably arise?  Then, more importantly, as yourself, if others will be interested in bitcoin.  How will it benefit them?  Will they actually use it?  How accepted is the idea of it among the college/highschool kids?  (They will be the main market 15 years from now.)  Do you think it has any advantages over credit/debit cards?  Is it better for the consumer and/or merchant to adopt it?  What does bitcoin actually improve for most people?  Is it easy enough of them to try it?

* I very much appreciate you raising this subject Gavin.  And thank you very, very much for the years of work you've done (often unpaid) to make Bitcoin what it is today.
* I'd like to make a comment, that I hope you’ll consider.  If we ever want to have privacy in Bitcoin, now is the time to implement it.  Once more regulation is enacted, and more pressure is brought to bear by corporate and media interests, it will become either enormously difficult or outright impossible to add privacy afterwards.  But if we begin the process *now*, it will be fine.  It needn't be perfect at first.  And, as new core-devs come onboard, they can improve it.
* Furthermore, it’s a certainty that at some point, some government(s) will have an enormous incentive to break bitcoin’s fungibility.  There will be morally and ethically compelling reasons to do so, (accompanied by subpoenas and warrants).  But doing so will destroy bitcoin, as a currency.  Meaningful privacy is critical in protecting the currency of Bitcoin.  (And guides prosecutors—for example—to focus their investigations on the actual crime that was committed, not they way in which that crime was funded or rewarded.  Just an example.)
* Lastly, a government breaking fungibility, such as by whitelisting or blacklisting certain coins, will threaten the decentralised nature of Bitcoin itself.  They who control the blacklist, control the coin.  Meaningful privacy is the solution to this.
* I know I’ve stated several lofty and unsubstantiated assertions here.  If you’d like me to further substantiate my points, with evidence and examples, please PM me, and I’m happy to do so.  Again, thank you for all your hard work!  I’m happy we have you as a spokesman and Chief Scientist!

Right.  I've read that.  And seen it alluded to several times on Reddit.  But that's not evidence; that's hearsay.  If someone's going to accuse someone else, of something as heinous as being a pederast, please provide some real evidence.  Otherwise, it's a pretty cruel thing to do to someone.  If he's innocent of such charges, it's a serious shame for him to be treated this way.  If he's guilty, by all means, please bring the evidence, and I'll be the first to chew out his jurisdiction's police chief for not already investigating this.

What was of note to me regarding the Sino-Russian oil deal, was that it was one of the few deals at this scale whereby the payment mechanism was not backed by USD.  Perhaps a starting trend?

The potential of bitcoin to disrupt conventional payment will make many a large corporation and government displeased.  If you can't see that, you can't see much.  And historically, threats as such have been quickly destroyed.  Be it through outlawing, regulation or "competitive" market pressure--which can, on occasion, be anything but competitive.
Bitcoin has the potential to offer a sliding scale of anonymity--from full transparency to full privacy--letting the individual choose.  Currently it can do full transparency, but not full privacy.  All that I and others are hoping for, is the ability of bitcoin to be able to do both fully.
If you personally don't need it or don't want it, then fine.  Don't use privacy.  But don't dismiss the importance of it, just by your lack of knowledge around it.  In past decades foreign governments have charged their own citizens with espionage, simply for possessing US dollars.  Often many went to jail without even a trial.  Something that would be nice to avoid in the future, with a little privacy.

I see your point.  Obviously, their main problem is that in the *Democratic* People's Republic of Korea, there’s not an ounce of *democracy*.  And you’re right in that a simple change of currency **isn’t nearly enough** to improve their situation.  However, for those wealthy enough to even be able to buy a cheap cellphone, the possibility exists (however difficult) for them to smuggle out some of their savings, and eventually get it in a digital form (such as bitcoin) where they can go back to work, but privately maintain control of their own *money*.
It would have made it a lot more difficult for the DPRK to have seized their citizens’ savings.

That we have Monero, does nothing to dispel my concern.  If bitcoin privacy isn't important to you, then don't bother with it.  But don't force your preference onto others.  If others would like transactional privacy, it's their choice.
Today, bitcoin is excellent at full transparency.  This in itself is fantastic for many applications.  But for those who don't prefer to make their transactions public, bitcoin only offers limited privacy.  Something that I hope is corrected shortly.
In the end, those who want transparency should be able to have it, and those who want privacy should be able to have it as well.  Bitcoin has the potential to provide a sliding scale of anonymity depending on what you want.

Sadly, the whole concept of "Innocent until Proven Guilty" was never codified in the US Constitution.  At the time, it was just considered common law (as brought over from the Magna Carta).  Nowadays, I wish it had been codified.
Along with another un-codified common law practice and popular expression from back in the day:  "There's no such thing as a victimless crime."  (I.e: it's not a crime if no one was adversely affected by the breaking of whatever law.)  That was never codified as well.  It's long since been forgotten from popular memory, and nowadays tons of folks go to jail yearly for "victimless crimes."
edit:  However I should add, if you think there's NO presumption of innocence in the US, you should try traveling to most third world nations.

No.  Banks are not "responsible for stuff like that," once possession has passed from the bank to the individual.  Banks are responsible when they themselves launder funds.

The process is a little confusing.  And it's true, the Fed doesn't physically "print" more money—although they've been doing that on the side as well.

This argument has been brought up over and over.  It's a fundamentally weak argument.
Selling pressure causing a downward price is only cause for impact to the degree that buying pressure doesn't keep pace.  Recall that ~3900 new coins enter the market each day, (in addition to the stolen MTGox ~440,000 coins being liquidated.)  That's a lot of supply.  If the MTGox hacker has a year-long plan to dump his coins (seemingly being done so on btc-e), then that totals about $2m/day added to the supply.
A lot of folks are interested in bitcoin, and the user market is growing, but not necessarily at $2m/day each and every day.  That’s when the supply/demand becomes apparent in the price.  I love buying at times like this.

Also, mass adoption should in theory increase the price slightly—even without hoarding.  If millions of folks are exchanging bitcoin, the collective time of which they are holding them, if even for a few seconds, acts like a momentary holding of them.
Bitcoin is near frictionless, so this effect is not strong.  Compared to a typical cash currency, it is many multiples faster, i.e. higher velocity.  This measure is often used when weighing the value of a currency.  This is often counter-intuitive for many, but the greater the velocity (lower friction), the greater the effective monetary supply of that currency is.  The greater the supply, then typically, the lower the exchange rate to other currencies.
It brings up an interesting and usually overlooked value in bitcoin.  Bitcoin, as a whole has a current market capitalization of around $7.7b in USD, and can be thought to be worth somewhere between Panama's and Ecuador's currency value.  (  This is obviously changing constantly.
However, this metric fails to account for bitcoin’s velocity.  If it’s velocity could be measured in a meaningful way, the value of it would be substantially more compared to other currencies.  Bitcoin is maintaining a roughly (very roughly) $7.7b market cap, with this velocity built-in—which is typically not considered.

It took JP Morgan 175 rejected patent applications, before they were approved for their "internet payment system" on 10 Dec. 2013.  JP Morgan kept tweaking their *facts* to get a lock on it.  The sad thing is, their system still sucks.  I'm sure they would love owning the bitcoin blockchain instead.
But even JP Morgan's crappy payment patent, opens up Bitcoin to infringement litigation.  It's not a question of whether it's *fair*, or *right*.  They could be dead wrong, but without the funds to combat them, they win in court.  It's a question of how can a community of folks who simply like the Bitcoin protocol generate the funds to mount a defense.
One of the crappy things about Bitcoin being so decentralized, is that it would make it incredibly challenging (at best) for folks to work as a team to combat such fraudulent measures.  This is where I wish the Bitcoin Foundation was less of a trade organisation, and more of an actual non-profit serving bitcoin users at large.

As proposed, the regulation regarding bitcoin is drastically wrong.
For all Ben's talk, he's more interested in control than consumer protection.  If he cared about consumer protection, consumers would be encouraged to keep their personal identities private! 
The proposed regulations will effectively ban bitcoin businesses in New York.  Unfortunately, he's surrounded by the echo-chamber of big business and a few dumb players in the bitcoin space.  (I wouldn't be surprised at all, if the Winklevii team were among those he consulted.)
 If he had truly listened to the bitcoin community, he would have heard the strong majority of bitcoiners say, bitcoin isn't ready for regulation yet.  For crying out loud, the protocol is still in beta, with a global market cap less than that of any one of thousands of corporations.
 Ben will earn my respect, the moment he actually does what the community of honest sincere bitcoin users want him to do.  He's hired to protect our interests, not his imagined interests of what would be good for us, and not the interests of NY's banking sector.  As it is, he's treating the bitcoin protocol, and by extension its users, like some get-rich-quick money laundering scheme.
 If he does not see that his proposed regulations, will drive every NY bitcoin startup out of the state, and cause nearly all startups based elsewhere to simply block NY users, then he honestly sees no value in bitcoin, and is playing the hand of NY's banking industry exactly as they would have hoped.  The proposed regs are full of draconian measures, any one of which would do this.
 It's clear to me he doesn't give a damn about actual consumers. 
And if it's money laundering he's worried about, then I have news for him: all anyone with means needs to do, is consult the very NY banks that do this professionally every day, every hour.  The best laundering techniques employed today are legal. In the rarity of instances that they're not 100% legal, the banks are well versed in structuring them to fall within gray areas of the law, with sufficient plausible deniability, etc. that enforcing them, is a legal nightmare.  And prone to a heavy majority of acquitted cases.  More than any other office, his office should know that.  How many bankers, who committed massive fraud in the last downturn, were successfully prosecuted nationwide?  That's right:  one.  One mid-level bank exec who likely was scapegoated by his very own company.
 Ben is politically ambitious. And I can't blame him with a base salary of around $130k while trying to get by in New York.  What he doesn't know, is that his fighting bitcoin, is like trying to fight the advent of the internet circa mid-90's.  The world wouldn't have cared if the internet had been effectively banned in New York.  Is simply would have routed around that, which is exactly what bitcoin will do, if Ben is so intent to enact the regulations as proposed. 
In the process, he will have earned a worldwide reputation, that will haunt the remainder of his political aspirations—coming up at every opportunity his opponents can muster. Every time he were to—hypothetically—call for a jobs creation bill, etc., he will be laughed and scorned at, as the over-zealous regulator who couldn't do a thing to stop rampant banking fraud, but did everything he could to destroy one of the world's next major growth markets: yes, bitcoin.
 Instead, all he needs to do, is simply listen to community of bitcoin users. None of them want this regulation—as proposed. And most don't want regulation—period—at this stage of development.

@_date: 2014-08-26 17:02:34


Ah, sure.  But that's discounting some of the other aspects the protocol provides, such as those I mentioned above, as well as creating a *provably* scarce resource, i.e. the coins themselves.


Again, sure.  A lot of us would love to have that metric.  But like I said, to actually calculate it *correctly* is a pain in the ass, beyond the scope of just cost averaging mining costs on a per transaction basis.


Of course.  I'm not an expert, but I think that's kind of obvious.  Not sure why you thought I forgot this.  Of course, if you were to run mining on a single machine, you’ve just set the miner’s value of securing the network, to near zero.


Again, not sure why you think I keep forgetting these things.  What you're suggesting is also pretty apparent, although some might argue this point, on other grounds.  But I'll give you credit in the sense that the perspective you're highlighting here, is the most common view on the matter.


Sure, that's a fine follow-up.  Of course, increases in the monetary supply, and inflation are not universally synonymous, but you're probably aware of that already.


Sure, and it's fine to think of it this way.  In fact, this is my preferred way of thinking about it when I ran my calcs on it.  But here's specifically where your logic breaks down from your original post—imho.  *If you assign the electrical costs to coin creation, then the costs to include transactions in your block as well, is nearly free.  Conversely, if you assign the electrical costs to transaction fees, then that excludes the true value of coin creation.*
Your original post took the running costs and averaged them over a per transaction basis, without including the exchange value of the coin they create in the process, nor it's NPV, now that that coin is in play over the network indefinitely.  That last value—the NPV—is the *killer* value, in that it changes the equation dramatically, but it’s very hard to accurately calculate.
To accurately calculate the network cost per transaction is complex.  And to attempt to do so by excluding several inherently linked values, creates an *artificially* high price per transaction estimation.

I've wondered the same thing regarding stores that issue gift cards.  How come their 'issuing' of a card isn't considered a private (albeit limited) money?  And if I sell that card on eBay for USD, am I not a money transmitter under US law?  But I would if I sold bitcoin?  What about software license keys?  What if I bought and sold those?
I don't think the regulators get what money is.  Money is not the value itself.  It's what represents that value in a convenient form factor.  The real value is the work and services and products that we trade, using currency as a lubricant.
The IRS has known about this for ages.  That's why they don't tax your work, they tax *'the value'* of your work, regardless of how you were paid.
Since it's already illegal to steal value from someone, and to avoid your taxes, etc. I don't see any of the currently proposed regulations *protecting* consumers in a Bitcoin context.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:24:04
Yes.  I did about $300k worth of business through Paypal back in '04-'05.  Seller protection as well as buyer protection was a joke then, with one caveat:  I did, in one instance have to track down a skammer, dox him and present substantial evidence (from several additional users as well) to Paypal of his running skam.  Even though he had carefully followed the letter of law regarding Paypal's EULA, (which would have screwed me), Paypal did close his account and refund me.  I was pleased with that, but it still didn't make up for the multitude of headaches in dealing with Paypal, and their version of "customer support."
I'd like Paypal to integrate bitcoin, and then as an optional feature, provide varying types and degrees of escrow (at charge).  A user could simply use bitcoin as irreversible cash through them, (if wanting the charges to be as cheap as possible), or opt for an escrow plan that works for their business.
The idea of specialized escrow services riding on top of a Bitcoin infrastructure is something I believe has merit.

@_date: 2014-09-01 02:49:14
Exactly.  And the reason that you're right is that Bitcoin at its core is simply speech.  It's a way to assign a quantitative number to a qualitative value (like any currency).  Bitcoin isn't the value itself.  It points to the value.  And says, 'this product or service you're offering is worth this number value to me.'
It's a language, i.e. protocol which can be implemented dozens of ways.
At this point, if it bitcoin fails, another crypto-currency will simply fill its shoes.

In the banking community it's pretty accepted that no one likes the structure of the Fed/Treasury relationship, and that over time, it's not sustainable.  Just no one has the ambition/resources/backing to even think about changing it.

Yes, the way it can casually stroll in and integrate into so many things is not short of amazing.
Changetip is one of those things I know will be around regardless of whether bitcoin succeeds or gets regulated into oblivion.  All they'd have to do is change their *currency* to a credit or a gift card like system to maintain.
The effect of being able to tip shouldn't be underestimated as well.  For example, a lot of kids don't like to pay for their music, when they can easily get it for free.  But on occasion—and in my own opinion of the scene, it's not that uncommon—they do feel some responsibility to give back to the artists they love.  In fact, I think they actually *like* to support their favorite artists, but in this age, it really has to be on their own terms.  Something like changetip allows them to bypass all the production and distribution infrastructure (use to account for over 90% of a CD's cost) and tip directly to their artists.
Also, let's not forget that Apple essentially destroyed the music distribution industry by doing something as equally subtle in their iTunes contracts:  by forcing the ability for kids to simply pay for one song instead of the whole album.  The change seemed subtle, but turned out to have a huge impact to the music industry—and that's just among users who were still willing to pay the overhead on supporting their bands' production/distribution/marketing infrastructure.  If I recall, there was a really good article about this effect;  it might have been in the New Yorker.
And yes, it's not all *kids* of course.  I just affectionally think of anyone under 30 as a kid.

Factoring all this together, it turns out you're pretty close.

And a market cap *value* (not just the regular market cap) increase of:  66m%, (or an average per year growth of 2,209%)

Thanks for posting.  Just finished reading your article.
I feel a little apologetic.  I'm not going to be able to give you what you deserve, which is a better overall education in argument writing.  I know that sounds incredibly crass.  Sorry.  But I am trying to give you honest feedback.
In short I didn't care for your article for several reasons, and even though you've exercised the decency of sincerely requesting feedback—an admirable quality in anyone—it's hard for me to summarise specifically how poorly written it is, without spending an enormous amount of time reviewing the fundamentals of argument writing.  At least as I was taught them.
We were taught to present a thesis and substantiate that argument with a succession of logical arguments each predicated on accepted, cited works.  So when the conclusion is arrived at, it's not only substantiated, but the logic employed is clear to follow.  This leaves the reader with the full understanding of why you're making whatever claim it is, and how you arrived at that determination.
I'm glad we were taught argument writing this way, and I've come to enjoy it in others'.  It does take a lot of work though.
Your article makes a few very large claims, several generalizations, and little in the way to substantiate them.
I don't think this article would have passed Mr. Bergstrom's *Basic College Writing* class standards.

Good rationale questions.  At this point, bitcoin is still an experiment.  If you like the idea, have fun with it.  Try tipping someone 5 milliBTC if you like their youtube video.  (See [Change tip](  Or if a merchant you like accepts it, try spending a little there.
As an "investment" a whole new set of questions must be addressed (at a personal level of course).  There's no FDIC, and no consumer protection measures in place, although option markets are warming up, which will allow for some stability, at a price.
If you feel like investing, this is a great time to do so, but regardless, bitcoin should occupy a very small proportion of your portfolio.  The part you would normally occupy with your extreme high risk investments.  While bitcoin is certainly my most entertaining investment, I won't hold more than about 7% of it.  And I'm very long on that 7% as well (5-10 years).

I don't have a problem with Ripple per se.  But just to clarify, Ripple is only partially decentralised.  And the problem with that is, as long as some certain parts remain centralised, it acts as if the whole thing is centralised.  Centralisation is useful in certain contexts, but most of us who have an interest in bitcoin, take issue with it.  Lastly, r/bitcoin is probably not the best place to get an unbiased answer about this.

Not "appointed", but "confirmed".  And a US president has never dared to *not* confirm the Fed's chairman-elect.  The other chief restrictions required of the Fed are quarterly (under oath) testimony to Congress, and (I could be wrong on this second point, but without reviewing their charter, I seem to recall) that they must provide on-call testimony in addition to that under certain conditions.  The other restrictions are pretty minor, if I remember correctly.


The Fed acts like a federal charge.  It's privately owned and operated, with monopolistic powers (obviously).  It's owned by its shareholders, which consist of banks.  (The list of banks is not made public, but if you could find out, you'd make several generations of journalists very happy!)  Their profit sharing is distributed at a fixed 6% per year to member banks.  Profits in excess of that are returned to Treasury.  (Some argue that the "profit" that's returned to Treasury was never the Fed's to begin with, but that's a different story.)


Which board are you referring to?  The Fed's board is elected by its members.  Only the one member they choose to be Chairman, is required to be confirmed by the executive branch.

I don't recall anyone seriously preaching that concern since the Nixon administration was forced to let the USD float without reserve.  Now with the advent of the Euro, China reducing its t-bill positions, nations looking to diversify payment for their natural resource exports, and the USD beginning to get relegated into a second tier payment option among international contracts, I think one has to wonder about it.
Nothing will change quickly when it comes to the world's most powerful currency, but still, if it is so powerful, why are so many looking to reduce their dependency on it?  And as a "store of value" I don't know any advisors recommending to hold USD, (when not for short term or emergency uses).

As proposed, the regulation regarding bitcoin is drastically wrong.
For all Ben's talk, he's more interested in control than consumer protection.  If he cared about consumer protection, consumers would be encouraged to keep their personal identities private!  
The proposed regulations will effectively ban bitcoin businesses in New York.  Unfortunately, he's surrounded by the echo-chamber of big business and a few dumb players in the bitcoin space.  (I wouldn't be surprised at all, if the Winklevii team were among those he consulted.)
  If he had truly listened to the bitcoin community, he would have heard the strong majority of bitcoiners say, bitcoin isn't ready for regulation yet.  For crying out loud, the protocol is still in beta, with a global market cap less than that of any one of thousands of corporations.
  Ben will earn my respect, the moment he actually does what the community of honest sincere bitcoin users want him to do.  He's hired to protect our interests, not his imagined interests of what would be good for us, and not the interests of NY's banking sector.  As it is, he's treating the bitcoin protocol, and by extension its users, like some get-rich-quick money laundering scheme.
  If he does not see that his proposed regulations, will drive every NY bitcoin startup out of the state, and cause nearly all startups based elsewhere to simply block NY users, then he honestly sees no value in bitcoin, and is playing the hand of NY's banking industry exactly as they would have hoped.  The proposed regs are full of draconian measures, any one of which would do this.
  It's clear to me he doesn't give a damn about actual consumers.  
And if it's money laundering he's worried about, then I have news for him: all anyone with means needs to do, is consult the very NY banks that do this professionally every day, every hour.  The best laundering techniques employed today are legal. In the rarity of instances that they're not 100% legal, the banks are well versed in structuring them to fall within gray areas of the law, with sufficient plausible deniability, etc. that enforcing them, is a legal nightmare.  And prone to a heavy majority of acquitted cases.  More than any other office, his office should know that.  How many bankers, who committed massive fraud in the last downturn, were successfully prosecuted nationwide?  That's right:  one.  One mid-level bank exec who likely was scapegoated by his very own company.
  Ben is politically ambitious. And I can't blame him with a base salary of around $130k while trying to get by in New York.  What he doesn't know, is that his fighting bitcoin, is like trying to fight the advent of the internet circa mid-90's.  The world wouldn't have cared if the internet had been effectively banned in New York.  Is simply would have routed around that, which is exactly what bitcoin will do, if Ben is so intent to enact the regulations as proposed.  
In the process, he will have earned a worldwide reputation, that will haunt the remainder of his political aspirations—coming up at every opportunity his opponents can muster. Every time he were to—hypothetically—call for a jobs creation bill, etc., he will be laughed and scorned at, as the over-zealous regulator who couldn't do a thing to stop rampant banking fraud, but did everything he could to destroy one of the world's next major growth markets: yes, bitcoin.
  Instead, all he needs to do, is simply listen to community of bitcoin users. None of them want this regulation—as proposed. And most don't want regulation—period—at this stage of development.

In the meantime, you are actually more right than you may know.  Bitcoin will likely reach DPRK well before the internet does.  Why?  Cellphones (with SMS texting) are being smuggled in by droves.

This whole thing is the biggest pile of steaming shit imaginable.  How can the folks we elect be this misinformed or do they purposefully hate bitcoin?
Bitcoin is not a bank.  It's a currency.  Since when was the British Pound, the German Deuchmark (I know-- the Euro now), the Singapore Dollar or the Chinese Yuan ever treated this way?
These regs won't protect consumers.  If that were at all a genuine concern, then these regs would be replaced by--for example--a hashing algorithm demonstrating (and proving) realtime solvency of an exchange's bitcoin wallets.  Or another hashing algorithm demonstrating--for example--provably fair gambling play.
These regs are about government control under the auspices of "protection."  The barriers to entry these regs create limit competition.  Limiting competition in bitcoin development at this stage is extremely hurtful to the overall growth and well being of the currency.  And there will be no killer apps written by college kids in their dorms, if these regs pass.  No companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Facebook or Yahoo--all of which started on a shoe-string budget, would have had a chance to breathe.

The US and Europe are not currently *the best* markets for the transactional use of bitcoin.  So yes, you're right.
However, both have increased their monetary supplies substantially in recent years.  To the extent this will lead to inflation is not yet known, but it can't help.  So bitcoin along with other hard assets can help hedge against that in 'stable' countries.

The Bitcoin protocol is amazingly self-regulating—not entirely so, but a surprising degree.
It's because typical currencies are fundamentally insecure, requiring substantial third party trust, that substantial regulation is necessary for them.
Bitcoin solves a few fundamental issues, and in so doing, is truly a new technology.  It most closely resembles digital cash.  But the breakthrough (that is the blockchain) has sweeping implications far outside of a currency.

Seriously?  Do people on Reddit just disagree with a comment first, and then look up facts afterwards?  Seems like that at times.
People have been questioning to what extent the Fed is private or public since its inception.  And it will probably boil down to a personal opinion.  Most people who are not particularly well educated about it, which is nearly everyone, side firmly on the, 'it's definitely public' or 'definitely private' sides.
The more one learns about it, one discovers there's a lot of complexity to it.  For example, while a strong argument rests with it being privately owned, in the sense that the shares of it are *owned* by member banks (and paid a dividend on), the degree of control the Fed has is limited by Congress, albeit not significantly in my opinion.


The Board of Governors is the name of the Fed's board.  It's not an outside board run by any of the three branches of government that either monitors or controls the Fed.  It's the decision-making body of the Fed itself.

Yes and No.
As prosecutors, yes, they have a public obligation to fulfill their role as, well, prosecutors.  However, the law affords them considerable latitude in how they do that—and for good reason.
The best exercise of justice lies in the ability to weigh the many factors involved, and effect a reasonable degree of pressure and/or punishment.  What I see here, is ***not*** that.  I see the typical "throw the book" at him, hope the charges stick, resulting in an easy plea deal—which they got.
I've never known a prosecutor to give a second thought as to whether (and to what extent) they should have charged.  Nor whether they just ruined someone's life in the process.
For crying out loud, we have grandmas in federal penitentiary for growing and consuming cannabis for their arthritis.  In one case I was reading about, an elderly lady invited an officer in her home for tea, only to be imprisoned, when he saw her plants in her kitchen.
Shrem's *amateur-ness*, clearly evident, is more of a sign of his lack of criminal intention.  Most pros in this business, who know very well what they're doing from the start, take the necessary steps from square-one to maintain security and plausible deniability.
Lastly, money-laundering is fundamentally a questionable "crime" to begin with.  If I think of routing certain funds in a certain way with a certain intention:  it's legal.  But if I think about it in a different way, even if I'm essentially doing the same thing, and am willing to disclose my thought process and paper trail, then it can be illegal.  This is one of the reasons banks place a premium on confidentially of their internal records.  No matter what their intentions, if records are made public, they may be used to construct a case against them, regardless of their intent.
This is also a reason that some folks (perhaps more on the extreme side) call money-laundering a "thought-crime."  It's already illegal to do whatever the action was, that the "laundering" is suspected of aiding.  Why not simply prosecute *that* original action?  And if the core action wasn't illegal, is it even laundering then?
In the case of Shrem, so what if he sold bitcoin to someone—even if they told him they were going to spend it at the Silk Road?  Several items for sale at the Silk Road are perfectly legal.  Furthermore, even if someone told Shrem they wanted bitcoin for the explicit reason of purchasing drugs, who's to say those drugs aren't legal in that person's jurisdiction?  The Silk Road sells internationally.

It's not that Bitcoin is big.  It isn't.  It's that its potential is big.  And the internet was ignored, looked down upon, and generally considered useless for decades until HTML happened to catch on.  You certainly wouldn't have told people that you thought the internet was "amazing" or that you were thinking of starting an "internet business."  You would have been laughed at and considered a freak.
The first time I entered a URL, there were a little less than 20 websites in existence.  And they sucked.  I couldn't see why anyone would want to use this protocol.  Was it just for its hyperlink capabilities?  Stanford Research Institute's implementation (and possibly creation) of hyperlinks was already vastly superior.
I also couldn't see why anyone would want to use hyperlinks, since I could just tell them where to go already, as well as send/receive files, pictures, text, etc.  I was wrong of course.
Remembering those times well, I find Bitcoin to be *VERY* similar to the early internet, especially will all the negative mainstream publicity it receives.  But like the internet, it will have substantial hurdles to get over.
Fortunately for the net, it was largely ignored by anyone in power until it had a chance to grow up.  And unfortunately for Bitcoin, it's already getting way too much political/media attention at this stage.
And by the way, in Sept 2013 the number of bitcoin transactions was about 30,000 per day.  Now it's about 65,000.

There's a common misconception that the dollar is what's valuable.  It's actually the goods and services that are valuable.  The dollar-value is simply a way to express that value.  An alternative currency doesn't succeed or fail based on its relative trading value to other currencies.  The Yen for example is a fine currency.  It's worth 1/100 of a dollar, but serves the needs of Japanese fine.
Where the issue of relative value comes into play is when currency is used as a store of value (which incidentally the USD is not great at).  In this case, what matters is the value of the currency relative to what it use to be valued at, i.e. whether it continues to go up or down.
A lot of folks simply look at bitcoin as an investment or a commodity (no surprise that the US IRS recently choose to tax it that way).  In fact, Bitcoin was designed and is better suited as a currency.  At least, that's where its real strength lies.
IMO Bitcoin succeeds just fine as long as people continue to adopt using it.  Relative price to other currencies is a whole other factor, and mostly irrelevant to the function of Bitcoin as a currency.

I can't blame you for that.  And of course, the video was utterly simplistic.  You took several questionable points the video made, and expounded on them.  In so doing, cracking the lid a bit open.  I just hope you don't put too much serious stock into your own conclusions as well.  Each argument you raised (while valid or not or somewhere in the middle) has had many books written about it, with many powerful arguments agreeing and opposing your views.
For example, your comment:

Yes, and more so.  Inflation doesn't only benefit individual debtors;  it's especially helpful for nations carrying large debt since they control their own monetary policy.
A nation can, for example, issue 10-yr t-bonds at 3% and then increase the monetary supply, adjust the prime rate, or enact other measures, making the yield owed on the bonds essentially free for them.
Of course, the citizens ultimately pay the price in the devaluation of their currency.  But then again, they always pay the price.  They're use to it.

As of course you know, mining and passing transactions are integrated in bitcoin.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the cost you describe:


is for both, not just for the transaction.  And the majority of that electrical cost is in producing the coin.  But once a coin is *found*, it can then be used indefinitely, so assigning a fixed dollar amount to it wouldn't accurately represent a per transaction cost.
And all of this, assumes, the protocol isn't improved up to facilitate micropayments.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's only because they're not purpose-built to hash.  If you compared their raw computational power to that of the current network of mining rigs, would the difference still be so extreme?
@_date: 2014-10-03 03:18:03
Good question.  I could go on and on, over why I felt each attempt was insufficient.  But it boils down to trust.  Simply, I could never trust any alternative currency attempts over my nation's fiat.  There were too many factors in play that could have devastated the 'money'.  And which have turned out to be the case.
With bitcoin, the code is peer-reviewable, and basically peer-written.  There's no one person or one business to trust that all is well with your 'value'.  Your coins cannot be seized, and value remains in the network as long as others continue to value it.  Regardless of anything else, save internet access.
Lastly, I can't invest in something unless there is critical mass.  A lot of great ideas fail, just because they can never fully get off the ground.  While we're all "early adopters" of bitcoin—even at this stage—there's sufficient mass to begin the (social) chain reaction.

Several things act deflationary, and that doesn't stop people from buying or selling those things on a regular basis.
I understand a lot of Keynesian economists hype this deflation argument, but as fond as I am of Keynes, this concern needs to be put in the proper context and given *just* its fair share—and no more—of weighted consideration.
What concerns me much more about bitcoin, (and I haven't heard anyone address this issue yet), is what happens to a population like that of the US, who have a median negative net worth.  If you're a net borrower, (as many homeowners are), the lack of inflation directly affects your ability to re-pay your loan(s).

If I remember correctly, gap manipulation can start at &gt;25% or &gt;33% control of hashing power. But your point is still a weak one however.
Since you hate bitcoin so much, why not study it for real and then criticise. Bitcoin has many massive flaws, with huge potentials for failure, none of which I've heard you comment on. You could put some serious whoop-ass into your comments, if you spent a little time learning the innards of the protocol. Who knows; your criticisms might even be helpful to the development then.

Agreed.  Also, coins that were purchased (i.e: non-mined) drive the price up at the time of purchase, which is necessarily, before they're spent.  Therefore, in this particular scenario, it's net-zero at worst.
For mined coins, it's obviously the oppostite.  Everytime they're sold there is downward pressure (around $2m per day).  That's why I say that *everyday the price is flat is a good day for bitcoin.*
For those early adopters, bitcoin-accepting merchant expansion isn't much of an issue.  Are they going to cash out now, just because Newegg, for example, accepts bitcoin?  No.  If their going to cash out, they'll do so for any number of reasons, but likely through an exchange if a bitcoin-merchant doesn't exist yet for what they want the funds for.  With Circle, now at 0% exchange fees this is especially true.
The *merchant's causing down-pressure* argument is a misnomer, veiling the fundamental question, which is, are folks hodling or cashing out.  None of the early adopters or serious investors that I know, have any interest in selling until at least 1% of the adoption occurs.  And by 1%, they mean *world adoption*, which is around 140x the current user base (admittedly rough estimate).
Lastly, many of these early adopters/massive hodlers were of a pretty optimistic and idealistic mind to have entered bitcoin when they did.  I believe that for them, wider merchant adoption suggests a growing overall bitcoin market, making it advantageous for them to hodl longer.

Welcome back.  Yea, it's one way of looking at it, which I believe is a valid measure, but there are many such metrics—some of which disagree with each other, others not.  All of the various metrics usually fail to account for something.
Economics is sort of a sloppy science.  Data and analysis typically suggest a conclusion, while not necessarily proving it.  Little can be proved in econ so we go by what the data points towards.
If Bitcoin truly succeeds, the transactional data embedded in the block chain will make for amazing degrees of analysis never before possible.  New economic theories will evolve and old ones will get refined to more accurately reflect what's happening in reality.

I believe there are some differences between politicians.  While many politicians believe bitcoin should simply disappear, a couple, for example, think bitcoin should not even be regulated.  And not to start a thread war here, but a few have even learned enough about safe alternatives to light-water reactors as to not dismiss the entire industry out of hand.  Other politicians do simply what their told by the benefactors.  Of course, corruption is rampant.  It always has been.  But within that are interesting folds, that on occasion challenge the status quo.  US history is ripe with such instances.  If you believe voting is fully irrelevant, then you've already lost.  And it's because so many share this sentiment, that big business is able to buy the remaining voting pool at discount.

Wrong on many levels.  Too many to write a page long reply of.  I'll make a small comment though.  I'm going to go out on a limb here, and state that, I suspect the chief difference we have, is in how we measure growth.  The price in USD of bitcoin is *not* the "growth" that interests me.  Bitcoin's success lies in its ability to build a thriving economy of its own—regardless of how that's measured against other currencies.  To the degree bitcoin succeeds in this (which has been nothing short of amazing to date), will be the degree its relative worth grows, as measured in price or price-volume.  This is a lagging indicator btw, never to be taken seriously.
Other than that, your arguments are not convincing in the slightest, and suggest a topical study of monetary economics, completely discounting—among other things—the velocity and off-chain transactions.

Ahh.  Apparently, you're not familiar with studies.  Not the kind you may be engaged in at school.  But the kind entire firms of professionals are devoted to, and charge an absolute shitload to perform.  Their very job hinges on their ability to produce mathematically backed research of things far more complicated than establishing a link variable between bitcoin addresses and users.


If you think that can't be done, then it might surprise you to learn these firms have no shortage of business nor repeat customers, which include many of the world's governments and Fortune 500 businesses.  If they can conduct a [study of Iraqi deaths]( during a war, with a 95% confidence interval within 44% of the mean, then determining the average number of bitcoin addresses per user is child’s play.

The average American lives in a daydream, wanting little more than to get off work, have a couple beers, watch his favorite sit-com, hop in the sack with his wife, and go to sleep.  Repeat.  Anything that violates that daydream is felt to be abrasive.
Furthermore, basic secondary education in the US is laughable.  It's no surprise the employers want to see a college degree from applicants for tasks as menial as secretarial work.
For my work, I have to interview a lot of folks.  It's tremendously difficult to find candidates who can truly think for themselves, problem-solve outside their area of study, bridging their creativity with their learned skill-set.  One can discount a nuanced understanding of complex issues.  We end up hiring one in about 125 interviews.  It tends to be the smart kids out of college, (even though their skill-set may be underdeveloped) that get the positions.

As someone who likes Bitcoin, I also like my credit cards.  *I know: blasphemy on r/bitcoin.*
But credit cards serve two important features:
* Most obviously, they provide *credit.*  As I pay off my bills each month now, I barely use this feature, but I sure did as a kid (and it was very appreciated at the time).
* Secondly, most of my cards are good dispute arbitrators, and by 'good' I mean the result ends in my favor.
Instead of MasterCard et al, employing lobbyists to regulate bitcoin into a steal box, they should be jumping on the chance to integrate push payments, a blockchain of their own, and bitcoin-like cryptographic techniques, conserving the confidentiality of users' identities.  That would be the *killer app* they'd like to have, but that would also require a board of directors to have the nuts to implement it—which they certainly don't have.  Not by a long shot.
It remains cheaper for them to simply lobby congress, the NYDFS and spread media FUD.  If bitcoin can break through the blitz of flying bull that's about to head its way (2015-2020), then it will succeed marvelously.  But equally possible, if not probable, Bitcoin will be tormented ravagedly by a half dozen industries until it's pinned to a corner.
Bitcoin threatens entire whole industries:  banks and central banks, credit cards, money transferrers, payment processors, insurers.  And they will fight back.  I'm not expecting it to be pretty.  The first real retaliation so far being NYDFS' BitLicense.  Don't let the proposed regulation fool you.  There's nothing of substance protecting consumers in it.  It's about control.

I'm sure these prosecutors are really proud of their ***bust***—pressuring yet another harmless kid into a plea deal.
And while they're doing that, countless professional launderers go to work, day in and day out.  The only difference is that they have the financial backing and legal counsel from those who specialize in these things.
Most of what the pros do is technically "legal" so there's nothing to prosecute.  And when it's not 100% legal, they know how to structure their arrangements to fall within certain grey areas of the law, making a successful prosecution of their practices, a legal nightmare.
Instead of facing any of these fundamental issues, or having the balls to investigate real cases, the prosecutors, as typical, go for the low hanging fruit.  Regardless of the fact that what Shrem did, is for all practical purposes, harmless.

If you sell bitcoins to someone how could you possibly know what they're going to spend it on?
Even if they tell you they're going to buy stuff at the silk road, what if they change their mind and don't?  How could you be responsible?
Also, the original silk road sold plenty that wasn't illegal.  So even if you sold them bitcoins, and they told you they were going to buy stuff at the silk road, you still woundn't even know if what they were buying was necessarily illegal.
Furthermore, even if they bought bitcoin from you, told you they were going to buy drugs or something from the silk road, and then in fact did so, what if it's legal for them to do so in their jurisdiction?  How can you be held responsible for that?
Lastly, what if they bought bitcoin from you, told you they were going to buy drugs from the silk road, did indeed do so, and it was it was illegal in their jurisdiction to do so, you still don't know their underlying reasons for doing that?  What if their grandma had asked them for some weed to help her with her arthritis?  Shouldn't that be the moral/ethical decision of the person doing the purchasing?  If they really feel it's necessary in an example as such, let them weigh their own risks and conscience.  You're not their moral judge or authority.
I see no way a seller of bitcoin should ever be held liable for preventing someone else from committing a crime.  If so, would a store like Home Depot be liable for selling a hammer that someone then uses illegally?
It's really a shame US prosecutors have become so vitriolic.  What they've so often gained in the way of great educations, intelligence and available resources at hand, they've often lost in the way of seeing the greater picture or exercising compassion.

Bitcoin wouldn't collapse, but users would get rolled back 3.5-4 years in terms of their ability to exchange it for fiat. Non-regulated exchanges like Localbitcoins.com would proliferate.  Those operating within a bitcoin world would continue to be able to do so.  This doesn’t collapse Bitcoin.  It just makes it harder to exchange for fiat.  I would continue to accept bitcoin as payment, since despite its volatility, I still consider it a better store of value than current fiat.


Yes, we're all familiar with this argument.  But money is not exactly debt.  True, contemporary central banks create money by creating an equal amount of debt, and fractional reserve lending multiplies this effect.  Yes, it's a vicious cycle, but a lot of economists seems to like the elastic nature of this dynamic.  Yes, it's probably not sustainable over the very long term, but since the entire world has been embarking on this experiment since the 1930s, only time will tell.  If money were truly equal to debt, then the wealthy would be showering their money upon the poor, and renaming their retained value something else.  




So?  Regardless of how one chooses to define “cash,” if there’s a market for it, then there’s a market for it.  If people want to exchange their “receipts” for BTC, so be it.  And vice versa.


Sure, but for all of bitcoin’s problems, liquidity against the M3 index isn’t something we need to worry about.  If that day ever comes, it will be a glorious day indeed.


Sure, but no need to get into the nitty-gritty.  Considering it as a centrally-controlled ledger is fine for the scope of your argument.

I wonder whether the entirety of the proposed regulations may be replaced by two things:
1.  Requirement of exchanges to publish a running hash of account balances proving, second by second, their solvency.
2.  Normal KYC &amp; AML requirements (already required by law).
I can't see how the proposed regulations benefit the consumer in any other way.  But there are certainly many ways in which these regulations severely damage the use of bitcoin.
It is fully obvious that the strong majority of people using bitcoin DON'T want these regulations, so what is the real reason they're even being proposed?  To protect vested interests outside of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:01:37
Yes and Yes!  I hadn't even thought of your first point before, and I'm sure there are many more excellent thoughts on the matter that can be included.
To multisiger:  For a *grandma-proof* wallet implementation, don't be afraid to exclude features the rest of us would love, and replace them with incredibly limiting, annoying, and possibly even invasive functionality.  You are actually doing her a favor.
Some thoughts that come to mind:
Daily and/or weekly spending limits.
Addresses of friends and relatives should get white-listed along with perhaps a couple hundred popular bitcoin addresses.  Then, trying to send bitcoin to anything outside of those addresses should throw a warning or not be allowed.  She would likely respond well to receiving an automated phone call or text message, ensuring (by pressing 1 for example) that she is sending to the right address.
Any known phishing sites should get blacklisted.  Consider as a public service, publishing a running list of such addresses, which automatically get blacklisted.  Likely not possible, but if you can think of a way, then go for it.
A record of her behavioral spending patterns (like credit cards companies keep) should be considered.  Flags thrown when attempts to spend outside of her normal behavior is spotted.  In fact, you might want to study the precautions credit cards companies use, and come up with something similar. 
Proximity checks might be in order, i.e. if she’s trying to spend at a restaurant or local market, then perhaps it goes through, *but not* if she’s trying to spend at food court in Bangkok when her phone’s location reads that she’s in Vancouver.  
Absolutely, do not let her change the "settings" on anything.
And again, don't worry about limiting functionality.  If the day comes that she actually begins to get annoyed by all the safety measures deployed on her behalf, that will mean she’s actually graduated from using the *grandma-proof* wallet, and is ready for a more robust version.

Agreed.  And thanks for your comment.  But please know that some elegant market solutions are coming into play, which massively trump the hammer and stone methods of convention regulation.
Obviously I'm very much opposed to any regulation of bitcoin at this time.  But I say that being largely in favor of many regulations.
The Bitcoin protocol brings a ton of new features to the market.  While often hailed as some kind of anonymous currency, it's real strength is in the amazing degree of transparency it affords.  Regulation that would require non-profits, public companies, government bodies, to cite their public keys could prove beneficial in years to come, leading to higher degrees of accountability.
The protocol can also do things like providing a running, up-to-the-second hash of all account balances.  In other words, an exchange could publish a hash of their accounts, continuously proving solvency of the exchange's holding.  (Certainly I would do business with that type of an exchange over the others.)  If this rumor is true, then it’s underway already in China:  
Furthermore, as new insights get turned into code, I can envision regulation (down the road) that makes it illegal for exchanges to hold your bitcoin balances at all.  That is, every account you maintain in bitcoin is simply part of your HD or multi-sig wallet, with conditions-for-use placed in advance--possibly even on a blockchain.
Lastly, even though Blockchain.info is just a wallet—I guess I should say, I just use their site as a wallet—one thing that's really cool about their business model, is that they never hold any customer funds, period.  Even if their own CEO, along with all the company engineers, were to try to hack your account, they couldn't.  This is an example of what can be done today—all before measures of regulation are introduced.
Just some thoughts.

If you like bitcoin, do something in the space, to make it more useful.  Or easier to use.  Or inform folks about it.  Do something to make it better.  Believe it or not, the price will eventually catch up with the value you (and the rest of us) put into it.
This endless asking on reddit of when is bitcoin going to be worth how much and vice versa is silly.  It suggests an intellect more concerned with making a quick buck than doing something meaningful in life.

@_date: 2014-09-16 02:22:32


Can’t help you there, but depending on your relationship with them, you may be able to inform them of your circumstances, and offer a solution.
For someone who grew up under the assumption the world was a treacherous, dangerous place, with everyone looking to simply serve their own best interests, I've been amazed by the understanding of others, when met with direct honesty.
If you’d like them to consider bitcoin, the key issue is that credit cards offer a lot more to the buyer than just payment.  So in a sense, you’d be asking them for two things.  To make the exchange more affordable to you, and to limit the power of their existing payment method.  For example, when they pay via CC, they may have a 1 to 18 month float, before their CC charges kick in.  Furthermore, they retain the right to dispute a charge, recovering their funds relatively easily.  Lastly, they may have other CC ‘perks’ (discounts, air miles etc.) that they utilize.
This doesn’t mean it’s an unworkable situation, but I’d be prepared to give back quite a bit.  Maybe even 1% net 180.  Remember, bitcoin is generally better for the merchant than the consumer, so you (acting as the merchant here) would have to adjust things to make it mutually beneficial.
Start soft by offering a discount when payment is received in BTC, and move on from there.  Let them keep CC as an option.  If appropriate, offer to send them a consultant to get them set up with a Coinbase or BitPay account (free).
Down the road, you may be able to offer a more substantial discount for using bitcoin, or if they get comfortable making occasional payments in bitcoin, you may be able to transition that to accepting payment *only* in bitcoin.  Just one redditor’s 2 satoshi.

You must not think much of the bitcoin community, if you think anyone gives a shit to issue thousands of transactions per day (at cost) just to inflate the numbers.  That would take a concerted effort on a large scale, and frankly, no one cares that much.
And pointing out the volume of price exchange doesn't prove your point in the slightest.  An exchange price volume chart has a mind of its own, with little correlation to real growth.
Transaction volume has been increasing at roughly 4x annualized since inception.  About 2x since last year.  And unlike your comment, that is one of the best metrics to measure growth by.  Even a sustained 2x Tx growth is massive.

It's an idea that seems to have merit, but it's been tried and tested in regular fiat currencies long ago.
The problem in doing so, is that it destroys the fungibility of the currency, which in turn destroys the currency.
Courts have repeatedly ruled that the currency represents a value and that value must remain immutable.  This doesn't preclude someone from still seeking justice if funds were stolen from them.  The courts obviously allow for that, just not at the expense of damaging fungibility of the currency.
I believe that this will someday be a huge issue in bitcoin.  Perhaps if some hacker steals a massive amount of bitcoin.  The temptation to make those coins valueless will be strong.  But if that day occurs, I for one, will be divesting of bitcoin.

If that's the case, then he's failed more than I could have imagined.  I can't recall a single thing in the proposed reg that *protects society from bitcoiners*.
There's a lot in there that protects the banking industry however.  Ben was so daft as to go the extra distance to specifically protect the **New York** banking industry, as cited in NYDFS proposed reg:
"Persons that are chartered under the New York Banking Law to conduct exchange services ***and*** are approved by the superintendent to engage in virtual currency business activity” are exempt from the licensing requirement.
Said another way, if the exchange your trying to set up is based in Texes (or anywhere outside New York for example), you may get permission to engage in business (under the license), but you still won't be exempt from this regulation unless you're also chartered under New York banking regs.

Ghash has acted very irresponsibly.  They could have just as easily increased their rates, until enough miners moved off to other pools.  That would have likely ended up with less price volatility in bitcoin, and possibly even more total income for Ghash, while keeping people confident in the decentralised architecture of the protocol.
Let's not forget, currently 21% of mining is done by 'unknown'.  To entertain an absolute worst case scenario, Ghash could currently have up to 63% of hashing power.  Please correct me if I'm wrong on this point.

Agreed.  Coins that were purchased (i.e: non-mined) drive the price up at the time of purchase, which is necessarily, before they're spent.  Therefore, in this particular scenario, it's net-zero at worst.
For mined coins, it's obviously the oppostite.  Everytime they're sold there is downward pressure (around $2m per day).  That's why I say that *everyday the price is flat is a good day for bitcoin.*
For those early adopters, bitcoin-accepting merchant expansion isn't much of an issue.  Are they going to cash out now, just because Newegg, for example, accepts bitcoin?  No.  If their going to cash out, they'll do so for any number of reasons, but likely through an exchange if a bitcoin-merchant doesn't exist yet for what they want the funds for.  With Circle, now at 0% exchange fees this is especially true.
The *merchant's causing down-pressure* argument is a misnomer, veiling the fundamental question, which is, are folks hodling or cashing out.  None of the early adopters or serious investors that I know, have any interest in selling until at least 1% of the adoption occurs.  And by 1%, they mean *world adoption*, which is around 140x the current user base (admittedly rough estimate).
Lastly, many of these early adopters/massive hodlers were of a pretty optimistic and idealistic mind to have entered bitcoin when they did.  I believe that for them, wider merchant adoption suggests a growing overall bitcoin market, making it advantageous for them to hodl longer.

They're trying to create a de-facto ban on Bitcoin by introducing regulation that is so retardedly stringent, that you can kiss the idea of "Bitcoin startup" + "New York" away.
Much of the same stuff happened back in the mid-to-late '90s over the internet.  But unfortunately for them, the internet grew to be too big before the regulators could really get their teeth in it.  Then 10 years later, they realised, why bother.

Since bitcoin has the potential to become widely adopted as currency, you can bet that nearly every US gov't agency will want their hand in it.  Either to monitor it, control it, "safeguard" it, outlaw it, or regulate it.
Any one US agency may not necessarily be trying to get rid of bitcoin (although I can see Treasury and the Fed being happy with its eventual disappearance).  Each agency may, in fact, be trying to just do their jobs.  Unfortunately, the meddling and cumulative effect of control of bitcoin, can easily destroy it, or leave it neutered by excessive regulation.  And that's just in the US.  Ministries in every other country will have their "concerns" as well.
The arpanet was able to flourish, and become the internet we use today, largely because most government agencies ignored it for its first three decades.

Bitcoin doesn't do the above examples.  The protocol is capable of it.  That's what amuses me.
What claims made of bitcoin have been falsified?  And who's making such claims?  Do you have evidence?

If they are related, I'm a little skeptical to the degree they're directly correlated.
My first-take guess is that they are more likely related through another metric, such as a reduction in users.
A lot of folks lost their bitcoin holdings with the failure of MTGox.  That was only about a 3.8% loss of bitcoin's market cap, but since the liquidity pool is so tiny, it has a disproportionately high effect on the price.
Also, China's PBC has been squirrelly on bitcoin:  allowing it, limiting it, allowing it, limiting it.  Sending many of the Chinese traders elsewhere.
One thing I can tell you with confidence is that greater volume over the limited supply of bitcoin, should certainly lead to higher prices.  Over what time frame, remains unknown.

I guess I don't understand your question.  Proof of payment is obvious by a few confirmations in the blockchain.  How you could provide "proof of service," I'm not sure.  Usually folks just send an invoice or receipt which describes the "service" to be paid for.  How to provide *proof* of that, I'm not sure.


For this, why not just publish your public key on your invoice.  They can use that to pay you and it links it to the blockchain, so you can check it later.

I like the idea (not sure at all how well it could be implemented though) of individuals buying, owning and maintaing their own ATMs, while participating in a coop (not unlike a Star or Cirrus system) which would relate to the legalities for its members and provide a degree of public tracking information to ensure safety--and honesty--in the ATM network.

Good question.  Short answer: no.
But look at the price volatility closely.  It's been extreme in recent years and has been even more extreme going back to inception.  (Obviously multi-year charts don't show this granularity.)  Until bitcoin derivative instruments are rolled out (which I hear rumor is underway), I haven't been able to identify anything that would likely reduce volatility, other than the gradual increase of the liquidity pool (happening slowly).

Well apparently they consider what he did in violation of money-transmitter laws, but when you're using a medium such as bitcoin, which only certain departments of government have even recently defined, then who's to say (until it's defined) that it is money?
If Shrem were selling software, say for example, (valid, paid for) serial numbers to Microsoft Office, which anyone could then use to either activate their copy of Office or sell to someone else who could then activate it, would money-transmitter laws be applicable?  Most of us would think no.  But when it's a Shaw-256 key does that make it money?  If so, all the government need do, is inform people that they consider it to be money now, and that applicable money-transmitter laws regarding it, will now be in effect.
To retroactively charge someone for a crime when the state of what bitcoin is, remains undefined, doesn't even leave the good actors the chance to exit the market, or consult with attorneys to get up to speed, so that they may implement the rules correctly.
It's a severely harsh punishment, and suggests a level of prosecutorial zeal that isn't warranted in this case.
In regard to money-laundering, I suspect that charge is more of a subset of violating the money-transmitter laws, particularly their AML, KYC, SAR, BSA regulations.  So if guilty of that latter, then also the former.

I eat out regularly, and I'm thinking about leaving paper wallets as tips.
I'm considering printing up a bunch of official bill-like paper wallets (like those at bitcoinpaperwallet.com ).  Probably denominated in .005btc (~$3) with instructions on them as to how to exchange them into fiat.
Next time I'm about to leave a restaurant, I'll ask the waiter whether he prefers a cash tip (I always tip in cash usually) or double in bitcoin.
If everyone chooses bitcoin, it will end up being a bit more pricey for me, but you know what:  if they all start trying out bitcoin, that pleases me more.

There's a lot of ways to look at this argument.  But firstly:  what is the US Dollar backed by?  Oh yea, "the full faith and credit" of the U.S. Government.
We know how well that turned out for the Native Americans.
Personally, I don't put a lot of faith in the US government—particularly its fiscal discipline.  Nor would I prefer a currency that is backed by any one nation.
Considering the way in which the world is changing, that information, business services, trade and cultures know no national boundaries, it makes sense to use a currency that's equally as international.

The first thing to do is find a good bitcoin gambling site.  Put your BTC down, double or nothing.  Now you'll have 2BTC.  A lot of people just quit right then and there.  That's a mistake.  The real key is to then take that whole sum and double-down on it again!  This is what separates the men from the boys.  Now you'll have 4BTC and earned a 4x multiplier on your capital.  High-Five!  You can do it!

Person : What about my notes?
Bank : I charge others an interest rate on them and charge you a small amount to keep your notes safe.  Except when the loans I make default, in which case, I'll have you pay me back through your taxes.  The IRS is better at enforcement anyway, so outsourcing that to them is a big cost saver.  Except when I need the notes right away, then I might just need to seize them on the spot.  But that's OK;  part of the tax you pay goes towards purchasing FDIC insurance for your account, in case I need to do that.

If it's any consolation, The Bank of England estimated in their [bitcoin report]( that there is currently 1.6m ~~wallets~~ addresses with a balance over .001btc.  That's easy to verify on the blockchain.
If a study can link the number of ~~wallets~~ addresses per user, then we might be on to something.  How to find a random sample of bitcoin users to query may prove challenging, but that's why some firms specialize in things like this.

Good question.  If the charge was fraudulent, then you're left with the same recourse, as if you had paid in cash.  With one caveat:  it's very hard for someone else to spend *your* bitcoin.  They'd need the key for that, and they're not going to guess it in this eon.
If the merchant is scamming folks, i.e. accepting payment, but not delivering their product/service up to stated levels, this is more easily mitigated by the leveraged interaction between many multiple consumers to one merchant.  In other words, it's hard for a merchant to stay in business while doing this on a repeated basis.  Customers, on the other hand, can get away with a lot of friendly fraud, especially if they know what they're doing.
Bitcoin, while not perfect, is better than the existing cash or debit card system imho.  I won't compare it to credit cards because there are fundamental differences in what they do.  More importantly, Bitcoin has the potential to be much, much better as multi-sig and HDW become widespread.

There is sort of a solution though—albeit an unfortunate one.  If the regs as proposed (or even approximately as proposed) are enacted, I'm very much in favor of a complete and immediate black out from ALL bitcoin businesses to New York users.
Preferably with a splash screen stating something to the effect of:




The amusing thing about this, is that one doesn't even have to petition bitcoin businesses to do this.  It will simply happen, with or without a splash screen.
Without being able to *control* bitcoin businesses, the primary goal (as I see it) of this regulation fails, and will many years later, likely get repealed.

I'm not sure if any are up yet.  I'm absolutely certain it will happen, for whatever that's worth.  I envision it first being set up for large auction house purchases or business arrangements etc., especially those occurring across national boundaries.  Later it could become common for everyday consumer purchases.
With multi-sig coming into play this year, the escrow service or arbiter could hold 1 or more of the keys, and upon decision, could release the key(s) to the "winning" party.  These would likely be specialized circumstances, regarding (for example) the sale of a boat or vehicle.
For highly litigious circumstances each party might hold 4 keys, with 7 remaining for a jury of sorts (so out of total of 15).  **Someone just wrote about this btw, but I can't remember where I saw it**  If both parties agree that the transfer went well, they themselves have 8 of 15 to allow for the transfer bypassing a jury entirely.  If there's a dispute the jury votes, and hands the majority of their keys (4 in this case) to the winning party.  This model might even be able to integrate into civil suits.
For everyday consumer escrow services, you would want this process automated in code, with perhaps only occasional human supervision in unusual circumstances.  But there could be a selection of escrow services that specialize in general bodies of retail, such as car or appliance shopping, or hiring a contractor, etc. that may be more tailored to the needs of the buyer/seller.  Furthermore, different escrow services could now compete against one another.  In a utopian view, the fairest of such would gain market traction.
In the case of a consumer buying something and claiming non-receipt, an automated process could ask a variety of questions.  For example, is there proof the item shipped?  (yes) Do you have the tracking number?  (yes)  Did the driver claim delivery? (yes) How many packages has the driver delivered in last ’n’ period of time?  (1150)  Has any of driver’s packages been claimed missing?  (2)  Did the shipping weight the carrier measured match the expected product weight?  (yes) How many times in 'n' time did the buyer make such claims? (2 in last month).  Out of how many total purchases?  (2)  How many complaints against seller for not delivering in 'n' time?  (5)  Out of how many transactions?  (34,000)  Pump it through your proprietary algorithms and see what you get.  In this case, it might go towards the seller's favor.  This is a very crude example of how a merchant could protect themselves through an automated system as such.
This is obviously a gross simplification, off the top of my head, but you get the rough idea.   Something like this could represent the kind of lowest level of everyday consumer purchases.  I’m sure others are developing such things much, Much, MUCH further.  I’ll be interested to see what they come up with, as bitcoin grows.  Hope that answered your questions.

You're right.  Attempting to predict a future price based solely upon past ***price*** performance has been proven to be no different than selection through random chance.  But there are many other metrics to define "performance" and tons of more ways to estimate potential growth.
As long as the number of new bitcoin users continues to grow, as well as the number of transactions and the rate of merchant adoption, bitcoin will be fine.  And it's price will follow suit.
Despite many comparisons between Bitcoin and M1, Bitcoin's potential market is the world's entire M3 monetary supply ***denominated*** in bitcoin.  At a current growth rate of about 400%, that would take bitcoin about 6 years.  I have no doubt that 90+% of people are ***not*** able to accept a change that radical over a period of time that short.  So I expect the growth curve to soften considerably.
But then again, I've been wrong many times—almost always by underestimating people's ability to accept change.

I find bitcoin's growth to be pretty organic as is.  Sure, there are a few proselytisers, but what innovate, new technology doesn't have them?  If anything, I think bitcoin suffers from a lack of a directed marketing campaign since there's so few with the funds and drive to make it happen.

Yep!  And my sense is that the original crypto crowd—still largely among us—represent pretty strong hands.
(One of my friends has outright told me, he'll *never* sell his 3500 bitcoin for any currency.  To him, they're a piece of history that he had a part in the making.  I think he takes some pride in that he mined them himself, back when it was easy to do, and everyone thought it was a bizarre, ridiculous notion.)
The weaker hands seem to come from the mining community and the daytrader folks.  Mark Stephens (aka Robert X. Cringely) has pointed out that it's a common Silicon Valley dynamic for the investor-class participants to cash out early, often well before the venture reaches its *real* growth phase.

It would need to start by linking an ID to a unique cryptographic address.  This may require an altcoin blockchain, or may be embedded in the--already secure--bitcoin blockchain.  Encrypted at certain stages of course.
(Just building this link between an ID and address opens other business-related revenue paths, but for the sake of just pursuing a Votecoin, you may not want to head that way--just FYI).
Figuring out a web and SMS interface that is utterly simply will be challenging.  But the idea is to allow anyone to vote over their phone, even just with SMS ideally.  Several precautions need to be in place, as when people lose their private key, etc.
Once a party has their unique address (which only they control) they may choose to vote for a particular candidate by sending them their "coin".  Preferably the coins do not have any monetary value, but if they were to cost a satoshi (to keep the process on the bitcoin block chain) that *may* be acceptable.
To the user, the entire process should feel coin-free, i.e. people use an app or send a text to vote via phone, without involving the user in the complications of how they're vote is being transmitted.  Normal users don't want to know that.  They just want to know that their vote is secure and was correctly received, and that "double-spends" can't happen.
Several other folks have commented on how a vote coin could be implemented.  I'm definitely not the best technical resource for this.  Far from it.  In fact, if I remember, I think there's a vote coin out there that's trying to get developed.  It's worthwhile to learn their methodology and compare that to other's thoughts on the matter.  Especially those that have given this much more consideration than myself.
If interested, do some digging around.  I think you'll be able to get up to speed quickly with the latest thoughts from people on this.  If you have any trouble finding info on it, contact some of the big players like Andreas or Gavin.  They'll guide you to the right people to contact.

I'm sure their price will adjust based on the market and/or how much they care to make it into a business (or not).
Once the ecosystem evolves, a lot of escrow will likely be coded into the blockchain, but there will always remain some escrow services requiring both party's trust.  I'm a big fan of multi-sig for this.
To the extent that they can establish that trust will likely go a long way at to what they can charge.

With a 10% worldwide adoption of bitcoin (which would be huge) occurring in ten years (doable at current rate), and based on the fact that there will be almost 20m bitcoin by that time, I come up with ~$300k per coin.
This of course fails to consider a ton of other variables, and sets as static many more.  But just for amusement.

Irreversible transactions are fantastic in certain situations.  And while credit cards and certain wire transfers remain reversible, bitcoin can become reversible through multi-sig escrow services.  So unlike the others, bitcoin has the ability to do both with ease.

It sounds like you're considering—and possibly trying to define the size of—the **liquidity pool** of BTC relative to the total amount in circulation.
Let me know if that's what you're referring to.
As an aside, the number of bitcoins in circulation is increasing at 3600 per day.  But there's also demand for them, which has been increasing for the last 5 years more so than the supply has been increasing, hence the price increase per coin.
The price volatility gets exaggerated (both going up and down) by bitcoin's small liquidity pool.

@_date: 2014-08-22 23:56:15
Yours is better written than my first thoughts on the issue.
But pleas make sure Dana Syracuse gets a copy, as only public commentary received by his office is required to be reviewed.
For what it's worth, my own thoughts on the matter:
As proposed, the regulation regarding bitcoin is drastically wrong.
For all Ben's talk, he's more interested in control than consumer protection. If he cared about consumer protection, consumers would be **encouraged** to keep their personal identities private!
The proposed regulations will effectively ban bitcoin businesses in New York. Unfortunately, he's surrounded by the echo-chamber of big business and a few dumb players in the bitcoin space. (I wouldn't be surprised at all, if the Winklevii team were among those he consulted.)
If he had truly listened to the bitcoin community, he would have heard the strong majority of bitcoiners say, bitcoin isn't ready for regulation yet. For crying out loud, the protocol is still in beta, with a global market cap less than that of any one of thousands of corporations.
Ben will earn my regards, the moment he actually does what the community of honest sincere bitcoin users want him to do. He's hired to protect our interests, not his imagined interests of what would be good for us, and not the interests of NY's banking sector. As it is, he's treating the bitcoin protocol, and by extension its users, like some get-rich-quick money laundering scheme.
If he does not see that his proposed regulations, will drive every NY bitcoin startup out of the state, and cause nearly all startups based elsewhere to simply block NY users, then he honestly sees no value in bitcoin, and is playing the hand of NY's banking industry exactly as they would have hoped.
The proposed regs are full of draconian measures, any one of which would do this.
It's clear to me he doesn't give a damn about actual consumers.
And if it's money laundering he's worried about, then I have news for him: all anyone with means needs to do, is consult the very NY banks that do this professionally every day, every hour. The best laundering techniques employed today are legal. In the rarity of instances that they're not 100% legal, the banks are well versed in structuring them to fall within gray areas of the law, with sufficient plausible deniability, etc. that enforcing them, is a legal nightmare. And prone to a heavy majority of acquitted cases. More than any other office, his office should know that. How many bankers, who committed massive fraud in the last downturn, were successfully prosecuted nationwide? That's right: one. One mid-level bank exec who likely was scapegoated by his very own company.
Ben is politically ambitious. And I can't blame him with a base salary of around $130k while trying to get by in New York. What he doesn't know, is that his fighting bitcoin, is like trying to fight the advent of the internet circa mid-90's. The world wouldn't have cared if the internet had been effectively banned in New York. Is simply would have routed around that, which is exactly what bitcoin will do, if Ben is so intent to enact the regulations as proposed.
In the process, he will have earned a worldwide reputation, that will haunt the remainder of his political aspirations—coming up at every opportunity his opponents can muster. Every time he were to—hypothetically—call for a jobs creation bill, etc., he will be laughed and scorned at, as the over-zealous regulator who couldn't do a thing to stop rampant banking fraud, but did everything he could to destroy one of the world's next major growth markets: yes, bitcoin.
Instead, all he needs to do, is simply listen to community of bitcoin users. None of them want this regulation—as proposed. And most don't want regulation—period—at this stage of development.

Laundering is already a crime, whether in USD, yen or bitcoin.  If in fact, he's guilty of it in his jurisdiction, then yes, he should be charged according to those laws.  Ripping people off is ripping people off, regardless of denomination of currency.
This has nothing to do with bitcoin.  It's like asking if it should be legal for someone to launder money in British Pounds.
The problem with Mark's case, is that he gives such plausible grounds to those who would simply consider him a bumbling idiot—not that that's a justifiable defense.

As mentioned early, that's the transaction price volume *in USD*.  Know what your looking at.  You can't trust Blockchain.info's ambiguous titles.  This is the volume chart that matters:

We may also be encountering a situation that feels like inflation, but isn't.  If the stolen MTGox coins are being dumped on the market, that would add inflation-like pressure to the ~3900 coins mined each day.  The current price slide began around the time Gox failed.  If the thief has a one-year plan to divest, that would put around 1200 extra coins on the market each day.

There's no **guarantees** in bitcoin;  i.e there's no one in a position of authority to make a guarantee or award compensation.
And there's nothing **physical** to the protocol.
The code is open-source and has been hacked at continuously.  There have been loses.  But they seem to be mainly due to folks storing their coins at exchanges or making security mistakes themselves.
Having said that, I trust the protocol more than any single bank or nation.  Everything has its flaws;  it's only a matter of degree.

Coinbase or Circle *might* let you wire funds to a corporate account.  If not, you'll have to send your BTC to a US exchange, have it deposited into your US bank account and have them send it to the company's account.

I usually feel uncomfortable around vegetarians, especially when they tout it in my face.  Several years ago I asked myself why.
I know abstaining from meat could be very healthy when properly done.  (Or at the least reducing my weekly intake of it.)  And I know that there's many strong environmental and political and moral reasons for doing so.  I realized I'm in a strange class here.  I actually agree with many of the reasons that people cite for being vegetarian and if I had more personal discipline, perhaps I would be.  But I don't, and I love the taste of several meat dishes.
So it brings up for me a little bit of the cartoon imagery of an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other.  The angel claiming the health benefits; the devil claiming how good a nice steak would be right now.  The matter remains unresolved for me--and so being, remains in my sort of default mode, i.e. continuing to eat meat.
When the internal friction I have with it, is made front and center, (by for example someone standing in front of me declaring their vegetarianism) I'd rather look the other way.  In short, I think I'd rather be a *veggie*, but for me at least, it seems pretty challenging to even think about it.
On occasion, I've wondered if others fall in this same boat.
Sorry to pull away from thread!  :/
I promise to not hold your vegetarianess against you!
@_date: 2014-08-11 05:04:46
agreed.  Also, the value lost coins has to the market cap is in *addition* to the monetary supply increasing under a roughly constant exchange price.  It's just another reason all is good, even under a ~constant price.

Coins that were purchased (i.e: non-mined) drive the price up at the time of purchase, which is necessarily, before they're spent. Therefore, in this particular scenario, it's net-zero at worst.
For mined coins, it's obviously the oppostite. Everytime they're sold there is downward pressure (around $2m per day). That's why I say that everyday the price is flat is a good day for bitcoin.
For those early adopters, bitcoin-accepting merchant expansion isn't much of an issue. Are they going to cash out now, just because Newegg, for example, accepts bitcoin? No. If their going to cash out, they'll do so for any number of reasons, but likely through an exchange if a bitcoin-merchant doesn't exist yet for what they want the funds for. With Circle, now at 0% exchange fees this is especially true.
The merchant's causing down-pressure argument is a misnomer, veiling the fundamental question, which is, are folks hodling or cashing out. None of the early adopters or serious investors that I know, have any interest in selling until at least 1% of the adoption occurs. And by 1%, they mean world adoption, which is around 140x the current user base (admittedly rough estimate).
Lastly, many of these early adopters/massive hodlers were of a pretty optimistic and idealistic mind to have entered bitcoin when they did. I believe that for them, wider merchant adoption suggests a growing overall bitcoin market, making it advantageous for them to hodl longer.

Well, you could eliminate bank fees by moving BTC in and out of a secondary coin, (while possibly conducting secondary arbitrage on that coin's value as well).  You'd want several coins to work with, so each transfer (of both coins) could be profitable.  It wouldn't be fully risk-averse as in the normal thinking of arbitrage, but you could likely mitigate for that.
Give it a shot, tell me how it goes.  If there's not an algorithm in use for this already, (easily determined by comparing the market values) then get one developed and sell it to an exchange or budding remittance startup.  Interesting idea.  Don't expect a wide spread to last once Bitcoin's liquidity improves.

@_date: 2014-08-10 05:55:51
true.  More importantly the CPI fails to take into account the opportunity cost had the USD monetary supply not been so heavily increased since 1914.
With a fixed monetary supply, we wouldn't have 0% inflation;  we'd have something closer to an averaged 11-12% deflation per year since 1914.  In other words, $1 USD in 1914 would have approximately $1m worth of purchasing power in 2014.

365.25 * 3910 = 1.428M BTC 
Miners, on average, beat the difficulty rate since adjustments to difficulty is a trailing algorithm.  Last I recall, mined block rewards were averaging around 3910 btc/day or a block every 9:12 min. (This from a few months ago.)  So we're likely still over a 10% "inflation".  Technically, it's an increase to the monetary supply, which some debate isn't exactly "inflation", although the two are clearly correlated.

I don't have any problem with an inventor making a buck (or in this case $500m) off this idea, provided he's subject to the same rules as any other minor, which in bitcoin's case he was, unless you have pertinent info to the contrary.
I'm a little confused.  What do you mean by the "initial" distribution?  That makes it sound like there was a latter distribution.  We're not talking series-a vs. series-b shares here.  Bitcoin didn't have any premined blocks, so the current distribution (another 16 years for a 99% distribution) should be the only distribution.  Am I missing something?
I'm not going to blame him at all for maintaining anonymity.  Once he breaks that, he's left with a shit ton of overzealous media to deal with, and will never be able to switch back to a private life again.  You probably know that he did break his silence during Newsweek's Dorain Nakamoto publicity stunt.
Do you feel skeptical of bitcoin on a whole or more on the optimistic side?  What's your take overall?

Exactly, in fact the vast majority of worldwide M3 is digital already, and fully subject to revocation.
That's the leading reason why swift or ACH transfers take so long to fully 100% clear.  If you have an account in another country, just try sending some cash there.  You'll be presented with two options:  pay a hefty fee for a relatively quick transfer (about 5 days for a developed first world nation, you'll be lucky to do it under 4%), or go for the "no-fee" option (whereby there are still fees and it's still pricey) and wait and wait and wait (up to about 90-93 days)
This is why folks were at first shocked and then excited to learn of the Bitcoin protocol's solving of this issue--a problem that was first postulated in 1975 and thought to be unsolvable.  All you have to do is wait for a few blocks to clear and your transfer is done.  And it's final.
If you want reversibility, insurance, or escrow services, etc., it's possible to build those features on top of the core protocol.

While it would be nice to have proper regulation, can you think of an example where it's implemented in a meaningful and effective manner?  I'm actually a fan of the concept, but when I see that at every point, the practical implementation of it turns out to be disastrous, I have to conclude it simply doesn't work.
I'm in Thailand currently, and there's apparently no regulation of anything.  At least none I can see in practice.  And while I cringe at the thought of what's happening environmentally, the nation somehow functions effectively.  People find a way to make do, and route around problems.  It's certainly a buyer beware state, but when everyone knows that those are the rules, it works out.
Regulation of Bitcoin is no different.  Many will get burned, but the majority will learn how to use it safely, and the proposed NY regs will eliminate crypto-currency startups from NY, while doing nothing to protect consumers.
Apologies in advance for the rant.

Agreed, provided there aren't alternatives.  It's my personal belief that if use of bitcoin were to hypothetically be made compulsory, this could present serious problems for debtors.
On the other hand, if bitcoin can remain simply an optional choice (as currently), along with several other optional currencies (and altcoins) then, the choices, measured in their totality, might provide degrees of flexibility that could be helpful to debtors.  Heavy emphasis on the word "might".  In short, it's a good question.  And there's no easy answers that I know of.  Except as I pointed out earlier, it's not necessarily such a big concern regarding commerce, as many Keynesian's have been worried about.


I see what you meant regarding your statement now.  So that's called the Gini index—and yes, bitcoin's gini index sucks.  I'm glad you noticed that.  A lot of folks gloss over that fact.  This is something that I find less of a concern right now, but it's worth keeping an eye on.  The reason I say that, is that if anyone were to try to distribute a new currency, in the beginning the wealth disparity would be extreme.  In fact, when Satoshi made the first trade with Finney in 2009, at that time, two people owned 100% of all bitcoin.  So it is getting better.  But how much it's getting better over how much time, is debatable.
As a whole, bitcoin is becoming more distributed, and as it does, it's gini index should continue to spread out.  It's still a very small currency.  For example, Tesla is a small car manufacturer, and bitcoin's market capitalization is worth 1/5 of Teslas.  If bitcoin catches on in the mainstream, it's market cap will be measured against the value of all currencies—not just a single small car company.  In time, I'm expecting it's gini index to further distribute, but if it doesn't, that is a dangerous sign (against mass adoption) imho.

I'm assuming you mean a fiat-to-BTC exchange.
If so, velocity remains a factor, even in your example.  If the $1b infusion of BTC demand happened immediately (time=0) then you're absolutely correct.  But if the transfer happened over, say one year, it might only raise the current price (of ~$236) to ~$307, and that's not including the effect of bitcoin's inflation of its monetary supply in the interim.
To compare, one might think of bitcoin as something that has already had $3.3b of value exchanged for it over a 5 year period.  Which caused the price to raise from 0.25¢ to $236 per bitcoin.  This is not a hard-set way to think of it.  Just something to consider for illustration.

Nothing indicates a reason for OFAC listing.  OP is free to work in the US or wherever, presuming he was granted a work visa/permit.  He's free to consider launching Bitcoin exchanges (or ATMs) in whatever nation he chooses.  Should he choose to fly back to Iran and open an exchange, only then will he not be able to exchange value from his business to the UN-protectorate nations having joined in the agreed sanctions against Iran.  The comments I've read here suggest appreciable legal naivete.  Even setting up an exchange in certain parts of IKA airport may still be legal (even by US law) if Iran was granted international zoning to parts of their airport, and that grant remains valid.

No, not for real—was exaggerating in Ross's case.  I guess I have very mixed feelings about this whole case.  Plus, knowing enough LEOs, I've seen way too many tricky (and sometimes outright illegal) things pulled off, all under the guise of a respectable, authoritative image.  Which I've come to learn is generally nonsense.
I very much doubt Ross is as tyranical as he was made out to be.  And unless real evidence can be brought to light regarding the "murder for hire" allegations, I give it no credit.  Especially in light of the DEA's conduct.
Lastly, I subscribe more to the Japanese system of imprisonment.  While I dislike many aspects of their legal system, they typically reserve jail time only for defendants that are truly a physical threat—hence their requirement to be physically barred.  They'll fine the hell out of someone (even for the rest of their life), and greatly limit their freedoms, etc.  But rarely do they jail folks unless they present a physical threat to society.
That makes more sense to me, especially in Ross's case.

**"Is it necessary..."** No.
Bitcoin can function just fine on a pretty low exchange rate.  We'd lose a lot of miners, and the mining field would likely consolidate (regrettably), but we'd still have more than enough of a hashing rate to protect the network.
**"Couldn't a stable, long-term value be ~$500?"**  Absolutely.
But that's a pretty long discussion, with several factors that have to be estimated, including the extent to which one believes Bitcoin adoption will supplant national currencies, the extent to which users decide to hold their bitcoins (versus spending them), and the expected velocity (in regard to bitcoin, I believe this is best calculated in unconventional terms, disconnected from the "equation of exchange").
Once we get some more data in, as to how users actually use their bitcoin, then we should be able to consolidate these questions down to simply what expectation one has of bitcoin's "market share" compare to other currencies.
A current soft-ceiling on bitcoin's value is around $374k in 2014 dollars, if it replaced 10% of global M2.  Higher velocity will lower this potential (and bitcoin is capable of extremely high velocity), and users' storing value by "hodling" their bitcoin will raise this potential.

For me, the internet back then didn't feel like that big of a deal.  A lot of companies provided email, FTP, etc.  (Some back in the 1970s)  Plus, there were a lot of BBSes back then, and I didn't use usenet.  When Mosaic came out, I tried WWW and there wasn't anything new that it brought that we couldn't already do.  (Except for links, which I felt were not that big of a deal.)
But the web brought an easy GUI and of course, pictures of cats.  Never underestimate these things for popular adoption.
When personal computers became available in a retail consumer way, we all knew it was going to change everything.  We weren't sure how though.  Visicalc had some compelling use cases, and there were a bunch of us nerds that just like playing with them.  I still don't understand why thousands and then millions of families bought Apple IIs, Commodore 64s, TRS-80s, etc.  They didn't add a lot of value to most people's lives, and they were expensive.  But there was something in the air.
Today, I don't feel the world is really ready for Bitcoin just yet.  Give it 3-5 years, but that sense of being on the edge of something really, really big, is exactly the same as when the personal computer was just coming out.

The "Getting Started" link on the right side panel is good.  Most wallets that you download to your phone or PC will be actual wallets (i.e: you'll have full control).  Web wallets, are usually "custodial" accounts, whereby one has to trust the site operators to keep your BTC safe.

Yes.  There's a lot of good ideas in the Constitution that aren't actually practiced by lawmakers.  Article 1 says Congress can't fund wars for longer than 2 years, and that the accounting of all public money should be published, but we don't see either of those things happening.
In regard to your point though, keep in mind that, at that time and for several decades afterwards, most money was printed and controlled by individual banks.  In other words, if it wasn't gold or silver (which States were allowed to coin), then it was in the form of a paper currency printed by individual banks and redeemable at them for gold or silver.  Currency back then was like what cheques are today.  And it was the norm for it to be issued by private banks.
At one time the US was just like the EU is today, only less united.  After the civil war, the "United States" (plural) became what it is today, the "United States" (singular), and basically became one nation, for better or worse.

As of about 2006, I can't recall hearing anymore internet "disbelievers" (trolls today).  I battled them since the late '80s—claiming the internet had world-changing potential.  It turns out every single one of their arguments was wrong, and every single one of my arguments was more right than I ever imagined.
And while I've never received a single confession of mis-judgement, or even an admission of error, I know somewhere they're using the net today, to do any one of the countless things, they once argued so vehemently, would never be done online.  After many years, they finally just shut up.
Sheep will be sheep.  It's their role to play the fool.  Whether it's in regard to the net, Bitcoin or the stock market.  But I'm grateful for them.  It's they, in mass, who allowed me to buy ETFC at 5.5/sell at 22; NILE at 34/sell at 65, AAPL at 55/sell at 160 (pre-split), TSLA at 25/sell at 172.

Agreed.  And I indirectly references this in another post as well.  What people commonly think of as "velocity" isn't really what the economic equation MV=PQ is about.  However, there remains a powerful effect, that is probably better defined under "transfer time" this I believe is of importance as it enlarges the effective monetary base, without adding anymore BTC to the network.
It may not be such an issue if we were comparing one flag fiat to another, but since we're comparing a flag fiat to bitcoin (which has a huge velocity) I believe it's relevant.
This effect will be countered to an unknown extent by the degree to which people hodl their BTC.  Currently, it's anyone's guess what that division is, and what it will allow in regard to upper price resistance.
I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but would love some better data about this.

I know of no "blockchain-based" wallets that do this.  All bitcoin is stored on the blockchain all over the world at once.  Therefore there's no transferring of bitcoin to another location.  Even if you sell your bitcoin, the person having bought your bitcoin, retains their value on the blockchain.

It turns out, he just considers bitcoin a part of history—and a part that he played a small role in, back when you could mine by CPU.

Why do you think anything "should be free"?
When there's competing interests offering nearly identical services, those of us who are *not* enslaved to convention, will gravitate toward the cheaper service.
ChangeTip is a great service and near free.  Obviously, Google wants to compete with them.  But for crying out loud, why not then *actually* compete.  Go face to face against ChangeTip.  Either match their service-to-price, or charge less.
ChangeTip will be charging 1% exit fee beginning 2015.  All transfers within their economy (send and receive) are free until you choose to cash out.
What Google has opted to do is not develop anything new per se.  They're using tired, old, weak technology here (not even making a profit on it, which should render their attempt entirely useless to them) and instead, they're implementing a traditional payment process.  It costs them a lot to run it, which they pass on to users.  Pointless.
I'm happy Google sees that users like the idea of direct tipping, but their implementation of this, is just dumb.  And I say that, from a standpoint of being largely fond of their decision making.  It's very rare they miss something like this, but it happens to the best of companies.  And I think that's primarily what folks are pointing out here:  their payment process for tipping is surprisingly conventional (especially for Google) and just plain dumb.

I'd have to say that simplifies the concepts so much, that it's more on the side of being incorrect than correct, but you're headed in the right direction.  
Basically it’s a bunch of game theory, mixed with a crowd-funding incentive structure, mixed with the decentralised nature of bitcoin.  
It all becomes a lot more relevant if you’re familiar with the sociology research that’s substantiated Francis Galton’s early research about the wisdom of crowds:
There's a few folks that have done an excellent job of explaining dominant assurance contracts.  Fundamentally, it's *NOT* a simple concept to get, unless you're Mike Hearn.  (After a talk, he just looks around the room and doesn't understand why anyone wouldn't get it.)
I don't know how much it interests you, but these folks explain it well:  (and fun to listen to)

That is not really the right logic that applies here.  Transactional volume is good (and probably the biggest determinant of bitcoin's long-term success) and that needn't necessarily relate to bitcoin's exchange rate.
Personally, what I'd like to see is a softening of the price, while the transactional volume continue to grow at roughly the 400% it's been doing for the last few years.
Bitcoin has already achieved a price that imho is so high, it's detrimental to its long-term success.  The protocol needs time to grow, without the influences of media and politicians, who in their short-sided view of things, place price above all else in their understanding of bitcoin.
Slow and steady growth, fleshing out the numerous problems along the way, and keeping regulators at bay for the time being, won't lead to a $2000/btc price 5 months from now.
But it may lead to a $200,000/btc 20 years from now.

They certainly are.


It certainly was.  The whole concept that the "Framers" brought to bear was unbelievably radical for its age.
Although they used different terminology, they essentially built the first **decentralised** government (at least since Greek times).  It was supposed to be a government serving the people, made up from the people.  No different today from all of us building a network to serve *everyone,* which in turn, is also run by *everyone.*  The gift of this form of democracy was to be that the government could never become tyrannical against its own people, because the people themselves were the ones to *run* it.  It was brilliantly conceived.  And protected by an early form of regulation: The Bill of Rights.  This limited the powers of the wealthy and the trade companies from infringing upon the people’s rights.  A "constitutionally-protected republic" was born.
Unfortunately, it's proven to not be durable, nor immune to corruption.  There was a time when the rest of the world looked up to America.  As a child growing up outside the US, I remember those times well.  American nationals were respected, admired even.  Internationally speaking, those days are gone.  But what I believe was America’s final collapse (in terms of its thought-leadership), was that few American citizens could actually grasp the accountability, power and responsibility they inherited.  Evenings in front of the television became a norm mid-60s.  And eventually it became too easy to order Domino’s than go to the polls.  Today, less than one-half of US citizens vote, and corporations control the legislative agenda.
This is a recurring problem with democracies.  They require relatively high-degrees of citizen responsibility and local participation to remain effective.  (This is also why some democracies today outlaw or fine their citizenry for *not* voting.  Ecuador, Australia as examples.)
Today, the US is akin to other police-states.  The "government" acts with little actual representation of the people's wishes.  And regulation, far from protecting citizens, furthers to constrain them.  It’s a sad state of affairs, but it’s natural for states to rise and fall.  The US is no different.

His comparison may not be perfect, but having launched a couple startups, with all that entails, I've experienced much of the same thing.  I was in a room with a handful of techies one day, being shown a demonstration of HTML.  There were about 20 websites in existence that day, and you can imagine what they looked like.  I thought it was pretty useless, since we had ways to do everything HTML did already minus the linking, which to put it mildly, had limited appeal at that time since so little was available online.
One of the young guys watching the demo with us (he might have been 19 years old), exclaimed during the demonstration, "This will be the primary medium of commerce.”  I remember it quite clearly, and yes, odd as it is sounds, those were the words he used.
Everyone in the room lambasted him, except me.  While I really couldn’t agree with him, he had pulled off some clever work, and so I choose to remain undecided and silent on it, and let the cards fall as they will.
Today that young man is on his second or third startup and worth many times more than I am.  His next business after he left us?  It was about 5 years later, selling these virtual game swords and things (used only within the game) that completely floored me that anyone would pay a dime for.  Still have trouble *getting* it.
Anyway, I’ve encountered this sentiment many times in the tech sector, both as someone dishing it out and as someone receiving it.  I believe it’s pretty common, even among geeks.

Yep, and if they try to stamp it out, it will turn into another altcoin.  And if they try to stamp that out, it will turn in to what will be appear to be the exchange of random information.  And if they try to stamp that out, it will turn into the exchange of perfectly legible information, that won't have the meaning it appears to.
The lawmakers problem is two-fold.  They can't stop two people from communicating.  And if those two people each decide to give the word "lalala" a certain value (representing goods or services, etc.) and they decide to exchange that word (carrying that value) between them, there's no way that can ever be stopped, without a full North Korean-like lock-down of the state, limiting all speech and assembly.

@_date: 2014-08-29 01:47:19
Yea, I know what you're getting at.  The thing is that it's very hard to do in practice.
Sure a ton of off-chain transactions are happening, but if the off-chain trades are exerting more demand than supply, then those extra coins have to come from somewhere.  An exchange can practice several techniques (should they even choose to favor a whale buyer) to limit the impact this has on the market (thereby keeping them more affordable for the buyer), but this is challenging at best, and certainly not sustainable.
The *effects* of off-chain buy orders, however the orders were routed, twisted and manipulated, trickle through various intermediaries and end up once again being accurately represented by bitcoin's price as a whole.  
Oh yea and you mentioned:

The question is in regard to a deflationary currency.  So let's assume it's deflating at 10% per year.  That is, it's value is increasing in regard to goods and services at that rate.  If I were a bank considering making a loan, I'd be better off just holding my bitcoin than lending it out.

Yes.  I've never known ambiguity to *not* be intentional.  I'm not a lawyer, but part of my work requires me to approve contracts of businesses we hire.  Over the years, in every case of ambiguity—however slight—it has never served us well.
Nowadays, the younger guys I work with, wonder why I'm a curmudgedy stickler of details.  On occasion I receive hesitation (like sighs or rolling eyes, but less dramatic) during our review meetings, even on occasion from prospective partners.  It took me awhile, but I've come to be grateful for this;  it's an indicator of who I can cross off the list.
Consistently over the years:  ambiguity = problems.
People complaining that a little ambiguity is probably fine = more problems.
The proposed DFS rules are so heavily predicated on **control**—at the expense of clarity, and even at the expense of user protection—I question much of the reasoning behind them.
Furthermore, a careful reading of the proposed regs suggests something peculiar.  At every instance of ambiguity in the regs, (which are many) common interpretation of what’s written leads to an **increase** in the scope of their control.  For example, while there are many ambiguous points, no where in the regs, is there an instance of ambiguity which could be interpreted as leading to greater control by businesses and users.  The ambiguity you correctly identified isn’t randomly distributed.  If it were, it would simply suggest poor execution on the part of their draft team.  In this case, it very much suggests the ambiguity as written, is intentional.
Hopefully this will tighten up in the next revision, but I don’t believe significant changes will be made to what’s been proposed.
A friend of mine works in the crypto-currency space for a company most here on Reddit would recognize.  He has to consult with regulators continually.  The other day he mentioned something to me that stuck.  In one of his meetings, he learned that the US can currently track better than 90% of all estimated, international money flows—regardless of the originating or destinated nations involved.
That's quite a powerful tool.  Even though he did make the distinction that the US can *track* that amount, not necessarily *control* it.  If true, I can see how threatening, the bitcoin protocol could be to certain federal agencies.  And the favorable position that would leave Ben Lawsky's department in relating to them, if their proposed state regulations can successfully track the crypto-space.

The US's income tax model was a travesty from the start.  They should have kept with just excise taxes, which is what the US and nearly all other States had used, up until the early 20th century.

Good point.  Future criminals take note:  first start a multi-national corporation, then have it conduct your illegal services.  If caught, pay 10%.  Better yet, distribute the risk by incorporating two dozen such companies, so if any single corporation gets caught, only it pays 10%.
And to follow your logic, why issue any fine?  A 10% fine harms thousands of innocent shareholders as well.

Even if a Bitcoin company wanted to be regulated—which is a terrible idea right now—it's very hard to even do so.
Regulators are typically a pain in the ass, even for a business looking froward to adhere to their *rules*.

It's a very good point you make, although personally it doesn't cut it for me.  Information is free.  There's always information around covering how to do any number of illegal things.  From uranium-235 distillation to building chemical reactants, to yes, I'm sure, how to ship things illegally.  The entirety of the world's information is out there, however difficult some slices of it may be to gain access.  It's an impossible task to attempt to censor every little piece.  The federal government in its attempt to do so, has banned public algorithms, certain large prime numbers, and even modest keys, such as those used for digital rights management.  And it's a losing battle.  At the end of the day, if someone commits a crime, they need to be simply charged for that crime.
If the Silk Road had a page describing how to evade customs handlers (I'll take your word for it that they had) then the question I'd ask is: "Is that illegal?"  If so, charge the responsible party.  If not, move on to the next charge.  Customs officers can take care of themselves;  they have plenty of means and expertise to do their job.  Charging the site operator (who I understand was not specifically selling illegal goods himself) makes no sense to me, and leads to an unwise and possibly dangerous precedent.
It's cases like this Ulbricht one, that cause me to question the prosecutorial zeal of the DOJ.  And at the end of the day, is it "justice" to send a kid to jail for the 30 or so years, for what he did--even if the court finds it is a crime?  I wouldn't want anyone's son or daughter to go away for that long.  That's not justice.  And where are the victims of his alleged crimes?  If the Silk Road served as a platform to allow drug sales, it seems to me that's a transaction between what's likely to be consenting adults.  How is that different than the laws that destroyed so many lives during Prohibition?  All for something, that since then, we decided to simply regulate and in ten years, the crime associated with it vanished.

It's a good question and a tough one.  And it's one that should be fully vetted before launching a venture.
I like the idea of crowdfunding the initial R&amp;D when possible, but this is obviously not sustainable revenue.
If I were producing a device such as a Trezor (for example), I'd consider putting more investment into the upfront hardware, including the screen and keys, (possibly re-purposing cheap phones for this).
Initially, I'd keep it simple, using little of its capability.  Then as updates are rolled out, I'd push the security updates out for free, but charge for updates which enhance the overall functionality of the device.  Users would also be incentivised to buy new hardware models, as these would ship with all the latest software perks.
I like what Satashi Labs has done and admire their effort.  And they show a lot of foresight jsut by jumping into this space, but the Chinese knock-off companies are with us, and here to stay.
This issue I have with the Trezor is that if you're going to have a device like this, you want a screen to present a QR code to someone for them scan with their phone.  You also want a camera to scan their code, or website, etc.  At this point, you might as well just put the Trezor on a phone.  How to securely do so, amidst all the Android attack vectors is beyond me.  Perhaps a specialized, highly-protected memory card or one of those tiny USB drives that barely protrude out from the port?  I’d be questioning what’s possible in that direction.

For one, the decision in this trial will speak volumes to the degree businesses have to take responsibility for (and survielling and reporting on) their customers.  For example, it's one thing if I open a marketplace and simply charge a fee to each retailing booth (that's how my local farmer's market is run).  It's quite another if I open a similar marketplace, but now I (as the owner of the place) am personally responsible for each of the goods and services sold at that market.
There's no way that I would be able to run around and check on everyone doing business to ensure whether or not they're compliant to each of the laws governed by each of their respective jurisdictions.
I call tell you for starters, we'd have no more farmer's markets or flea markets.  Take a website serving an international clientele, and the problems multiply by orders of magnatude. 
A much more simple approach is to just allow for an open market.  Inform buyers that it their responsibility to learn and to adhere to the laws that govern them. If you live in Afghanistan (where alcohol is illegal) don't accuse and shutdown eBay if someone living there bought alcohol off eBay.  On the other hand, if someone in the US buys hashish off an eBay like site, don't charge eBay. Charge the person who bought the drugs since that's the laws they're under.
It's already illegal to do many of these alleged crimes made against this kid. If that's the case make the bust in the crime itself, not the avenue or arena that provided the place for it to happen with. 
By the logic the government uses, cars should be illegal since they often serve at the purposes of someone doing something illegal. No.  Charge for the crime itself.  Don't charge the owner of the night bazaar, or the ISP service that someone used to do something illegal through, or the fiber-optic
companies, or the computer manufacturer.  Just charge the person with the crime. And it shouldn't be worthy of a "crime" to open a free market, online or elsewhere.

That Bitcoin, furthermore, offers degrees of anonymity is a consumer-protection godsend.

I think the question is one of prosecutionary equality.
To the extent that America's drug war has inadvertently entered this discussion (sorry for my partly bringing it into discussion), that represents one of the few arenas whereby the US is, at the very least, consistent and equal in its prosecutional zeal.
In regard to the banking sector, America is all over the map as to what it prosecutes and what it doesn't, with an apparent favoritism afforded large corporations, regardless of how indulgent their crimes.  To the extent this perceived favoritism is accurate is hard to tell, but I for one, am convinced it's valid, whether regulators themselves are aware of it or not.
It takes a lot to step back and look at the bigger picture, especially for those of us mired in the minutiae of this on a weekly basis.  But it's worth questioning (for example) the US' 2008 financial fiasco, and considering that throughout that entire affair, only one mid-level manager (among all the thousands of corporations involved) was sent to jail.  Everyone else walked, or had some fine applied to their company.  (Which is akin to 'boo-hoo.')  At the same time, millions lost their homes and/or their investments and were left utterly, indisputably screwed over.
It's instances like this that the regulators fail.  And they continue to fail, time and time again.  Whether it's the S&amp;L crises, the derivatives-market crisis, the home mortgage crises, etc. to the point whereby a reasonable person begins to question, "Who are they actually serving?"
And when departments like the NYDFS begin to consider regulating Bitcoin—against the widespread and very vocal opposition of its own users—while ignoring for example, Wallstreet's lust for and often unethical uses of HFT, it calls the regulators' intentions into question, more so than ever before.
It's possible that beneath the hype and ego-aggrandizing, the only thing the regulators truly care about is the well being of their own fiscal budgets.

Coinapult is a neat little site.  So the thing I like about it is that you can transfer some of you wealth into btc, then lock it to a gold or silver rate.  Then when you want to transfer it out, you can unlock it and send wherever you want.
It's a bit pricey.  I think it's 1% to both lock and unlock it, but I could be wrong.  Worth looking into to check for yourself.
Also, bitcoin is highly volatile, but over the last 5 years, retains a track record that would make any wallstreet trader salivate.

While we're certainly not "worse off" now than during the US's Great Depression (which incidentally was felt around the world), we would be in a far better position if the monetary supply was static.
Obviously, I'm not a Keynesian when it comes to monetary theory.  And many fine economists disagree with this standpoint, so it's a matter of your personal choice.  The last debate I watched between Kruger and the Austrians, it was clear to me that specifically (and only) as it regards monetary policy, the Austrians won the arguments hands down.
However, most economists (regardless of ideology) will attest that the CPI is largely irrelevant.  It serves as a convenient metric for politicians, but other than that, it's largely deceiving in how the public or media understands it.
The main problem is that the prices it incorporates are only "consumable goods."  Furthermore, what's included and excluded from the CPI has been tweaked so often, that meaningful comparisons to previous decades is difficult at best.  Lastly, the very items that are the most expensive for a person to pay on a monthly basis, are excluded from it.  (Homes, cars, rent, medical expenses).
Younger folks will find this hard to believe, but there was a time not long ago when jobs were plentiful in the US.  When large auditoriums were rented to provide job fairs, where employers were desperate to hire enough staff to run their businesses.  And where a postman's income was enough to buy a home, support his wife, and send his children to college, while still having a little extra for vacations.  And this was not only true for postmen, it was true for bread bakers, dry-cleaners, school teachers, the entire middle-class of blue-collar workers.
Time again, this market dynamic is what happens, when wealth is more evenly distributed in a society, and the value of the currency is kept in-check.

But researchers are open to the idea that we may be looking at things wrong from the outset.  What we commonly think of as two things may be one thing.  And we still have a lot to learn about space/time itself, and consequently distance.
I find quantum mechanics to be highly counter-intuitive.  And like most things, the deeper you get into it, the harder it is to explain.  Furthermore, I know very little about it.  Just a few of the questions physicists are grappling with.  How the link between paired particles violating C being one of them.

Good points.  If the police were seriously interested in reducing real crime (and by that I mean harmful crimes involving actual victims) not only would they support the SR, they'd launch a version of their own.
Regarding drug sales:
Simply taking the whole transactional space off the streets, away from gangs, guns, paper bags of cash, and the occasional hot-load, would help society greatly.  Buyers and sellers in an online environment are free of violent crime.  Purity levels and dosage amounts can be specified and labelled.  Seller reputation can be tracked and published.
Consider the crime bosses that were made during the prohibition era, and the reduction in crime that subsequently followed with its repeal.  It amazes me that prohibition lasted all of 13 years, and all the damage and crime it created.  Today, we have a perfect parallel.  Only this time, it's been going on for the last 45 years.  A serious crime in itself, having destroyed 100s of thousands of lives.

Yea, even $29 will be a little pricey for folks in developing nations, but when you consider all that a *semi*-smartphone does for them—checking weather for farming, coordinating a ride into town, getting news, etc.—I think they'll pony up.  They already are in large part, selling like hotcakes in even remote regions of the world.
Compound that by the volatility of many 3rd world currencies, and it bodes especially well for bitcoin.
If the day comes that we have p2p distributed cellphone coverage (one phone acting as the hotspot for another) the reach will extend even further.

Bitcoin is digital cash.  And like everything, there's a certain place for it.  It's not a replacement for an extension of credit and escrow services--both of which are provided by credit cards.

I often feel that a prolonged cooling-off period of price is just what Bitcoin needs.  Steep price growth isn't *necessarily* a good thing, and widespread adoption can arrive too early, creating further complications.  There's still tons of work to do:  making wallets more user-friendly/secure, developing the ecosystem in general, and building out the core (e.g. we still haven't found the right balance for our miners' incentivisation structure;  [Dave Hudson]( has some noteworthy analysis of this).
It's simply amazing, that bitcoin even reached parity with the USD as quickly as it did.  That, in itself, is a massive accomplishment.  The further high-water marks Bitcoin has achieved invite media and political scrutiny, as well as that from regulators and legacy financial businesses.
A cool-off would ease the hype;  and I doubt it would slow down any real development.  BTW, always appreciate your posts here.

Wealth also goes through periods of general distribution (often following major wars), but in general you're right that wealth likes to consolidate (regardless of denomination).
To personify bitcoin, I don't think it’s ever pretended this is any different—be it measured in btc or fiat.  Furthermore, if you're looking for a crypto-currency that solves every social/monetary dilema, then good luck.  You won’t find it here, or among any altcoin, or any fiat the world has known.
I came to bitcoin, (and before that virtual goods) as a complete skeptic, but the more I've learned about it, the more intrigued I am.  And for those comfortable accepting a high-degree of financial risk, paying $230 for 1/21m of a fixed, worldwide asset is dirt cheap.

Not so much.  Anecdotal but, when my neighbor lost a substantial portion of his fortune via margin call, none of the rest of us were affected.  Sure you can argue local businesses lost some small amount of income that he would have otherwise spent on them, but for every sell, there's a buy, and now someone/thing else is spending his previous value.
In the case of emptyGox, if Karpeles walked away stealing a shit ton of BTC, he'll be looking to spend/invest it elsewhere.  If he didn't, and the collapse was due to his sheer ineptitude (easily plausible), then the lost BTC, has just increased the *value* of everyone else's BTC by a small fraction.  In either case, the inherent value was not necessarily lost.  Transferred wrongfully?  Of course.
Regulation may help safe-guard that stored value when it's under the control of an operator such as Karpeles, but instead of introducing more bureaucracy from a regulatory body mired in its own emasculation (be it from political pressure or not), why not let the Bitcoin protocol itself address it.  **No other technology** can offer the degree of self-regulation that Bitcoin can.  From its ability to offer full institutional transparency, to its ability to provide up-to-the-minute provable accounting of reserves, to its ability to let a third-party institution, use, and even invest, a person’s bitcoin *without* that person necessarily forfeiting ownership of their BTC (this through publicly reviewable algorithm, not trust, nor contract), why not let the protocol, and the tons of people supporting it, develop these ideas without governmental regulation?  Even this last week, a multi-sig development was made in securing the exchange of BTC prior to block confirmation, that is very interesting, and could have profound implications.
We know the history of regulation.  You, I’m sure, more than others.  This technology needs a chance to breath.  A few dozen failures, even several hundred failures and outright scandals, are normal for something of this magnitude at this young age.  And the failures we’ve seen to date, account for little more than scams (already illegal, will continue regardless, and already addressable through traditional legal channels) and outright technological incompetence, (placing them on par with most businesses).  All these things are currently getting addressed at the protocol and layered levels, without governmental interference.

It's a rabbit hole that quickly enters exponential complexity.  
Traditionally, gold or the stock market, aren't things to be considered when measuring the value of the monetary supply of a currency.  Those are assets, whereas a modern currency is a debt-instrument.
However, Bitcoin does change things.  And it will be hard to know how exactly.
For example, if Bitcoin were to catch on, someone who might otherwise have a proportion of their savings in bonds, earning a very moderate interest, may opt to store that value in BTC, and trust the deflationary nature of a fixed-supply currency to foster an increase in purchasing power.
Obviously, this example (bonds to bitcoin) isn't comparable until BTC volatility substantially decreases, but I believe the argument is still valuable.  Bitcoin has the potential to cut into asset-classes not typically considered *supplant-able* by currencies.

Yes.  Actually those are called red flag laws and they were largely implemented in Great Briton (and some US states) in the late 1800s. At the bequest of the railroad industry, a ton of regulation was placed on the burgeoning new automobile industry. The laws were so limiting in Great Briton that they effectively put an end to their development of the automobile even though England had the world lead at the time on engine technology. Thankfully not all US states subscribed to this nonsense, which allowed the non-regulating states to usher in the growth of what would become one of America's major exports for the next 70 years.

Typical "investors" don't know what they're invested in, much less how to invest, much less how to even spell what they're invested in.  It's a marvel of genetic evolution that they're capable of forming sentences like other human beings, and occasionally having the rare coherent thought.  They're good at watching TV, some of them are good at golf as well, but the scoring maths require them to keep a pad and pen since digits are involved.  When fed sufficient news coverage, they will eventually do what they’re told, but they move slowly.  It's as if they were bred to be sheep—their primary strength lying in their ability to provide wealth for others, at which they excel.  And don't get me wrong, I like investors.

Yes, I'm happy you mentioned that.
Very true;  simply holding fiat is "not a store of value" as any investment adviser will tell you.  Interestingly, this is precisely one of the arguments waged unsuccessfully against bitcoin by Keynesian economists.  (Paul Krugman as an example.)
Furthermore, when one *beats* inflation by gaining more in investment returns than one loses to inflation, this is by no means *beating* it.  The effect is cumulative regardless.  For example, if someone made 11% on their investments last year, and lost 2.4% of that value to inflation, their net take-away as expressed in the "value" of their ROI would be 8.6%.  It's still theft regardless of whether someone outperforms the inflation rate.  And fiscal policies such as QE add greatly to this, as we are likely to feel over the next 20 years.

I'd estimate that massive level fraud is actually better conducted through an environment that's "highly regulated."
Reason being that, the best, most comprehensive legislation always has its holes.  And when they're exploited, they're done so against folks who have been unknowingly misguided by the notion that they're "protected."
A free market bazaar, as often found in the third-world, is filled with scammers, but everyone knows this fact, and caveat emptor is the rule of the land.

Concise and poignant as always with Erik.
The problem is actually much worse.  Inflation in the US is measured against the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has been continually toyed with over the years making long-term comparisons impossible.  Furthermore, the CPI only measures "consumable goods" excluding cars and homes.
This is meaningful because one's mortgage payment (or indirectly through their rent) and their vehicle(s), typically constitute the largest monthly bills a person incurs.
Where I live, the CPI has absolutely no relationship to reality whatsoever.  With an average home mortgage of USD $11,000 per month, it makes no difference if a bag of rice costs 2.3% more than last year.
To get a real sense of inflation, all the things we purchase, consumables and not, need to be accounted for.  And if that were the case, the USD—the world's *strongest* currency—has lost a lot more than 99% of its value since 1913.

Good points gizram84.  In regard to [deleted]'s (lol) comment:


This metric may actually be a little more relevant than many expect.  Reason being in that, this is how all currency is measured.
USD, Euro, Yuan, etc. when measured for transaction frequency, includes all intra-corporation and intra-person transfers.  I.e, a significant amount of wealth is transferred between one person's checking account, their trading account, their retirement account, (their Cayman Island accounts :), etc.  The same is true for corporations.  Of their gross revenue, that value, is typically transferred 3-15 times before leaving the corporation's ownership.
I've heard this argument brought up a number times against bitcoin, but as it's measured in bitcoin is no different than that of any other currency.

The US Federal Reserve is a private central bank with shares owned by, and dividends paid to, its member banks.  (Not unlike most central banks.)  The executive and congressional branches have limited authority over it, including the inability to audit it, or override its board decisions.  There are many popular misconceptions about central banks, but unfortunately I'm not here to dispel popular myths regarding them.
On a national basis, it is not illegal to attempt to "compete" with the Federal Reserve although any attempt is doubtful to succeed, and taxes are required to be made payable in Federal Reserve notes or credit (i.e: USD).  On a state basis, a few states have made the use of any currency other than the USD illegal, but most allow alternative currencies, provided taxes continue to be paid in USD.  (Of note, California recently repealed its USD-only law, in favor of alternative currencies.)
There's been several alternatives to the USD over the decades, particularly before the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and especially before Andrew Jackson's term in office (1829-1837).  Many of them, quite interesting, and nearly all of them commodity-backed.

You describe a scenario whereby the subsequent fiat exchanges of value lead to a consolidation of fiat wealth.  This anecdotal example is in itself questionable, but furthermore, you fail to mention who's buying the mined bitcoin.  If the bitcoin is purchased by average-income earners, who 15 years from now benefit from a price increase, then there's your example of counter-consolidation in bitcoin.

Yea, yea.  Tell us something we didn't already know.  All kinds of attack vectors at this level, but unless there's a van parked outside your mining operation, I wouldn't worry about it.

Make no mistake Warren Buffett is a great investor, possibly the greatest, honest investor of our time.  And he follows a certain methodology, part of which is not investing in anything he doesn't understand fully.  I can't blame him for not investing in bitcoin.  It's simply not in his risk-tolerance or investment methodology.
And how many bitcoiners fully understand bitcoin anyway?  I don't.  And I'm skeptical of anyone claiming they do.
On the other hand, for those of us who are much more risk-tolerant, and enjoy having a little skin in the game of an amazing new technology with outstanding potential, then sure, I'm game.
Where Buffett errs, imho, is in telling others to *not* invest in bitcoin.  It would be more even-handed of him to simply identify bitcoin's high volatility and risk at success, and suggest to others to research it thoroughly before investing.

How come you didn't accept payment in bitcoin indexed to USD or another asset-class?  
@_date: 2015-01-31 03:29:36
Yes, Bitcoin has a terrible gini coefficient.  But unlike states like the US, the UK, India and China where it's getting steadily worse, Bitcoin's gini index is rapidly improving.
(Let's not forget that every currency begins life with a gini index of 1, i.e. total inequality.  It takes time to distribute, and btc is no different.)
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:23:04
Agreed.  Unfortunately, there's a divide here that the reddit trolls are all to eager to exploit.
There are those of us who appreciate the technology, can see its promise, and remain in awe at the implications this breakthrough can bring.
Then, there are the rest.  Many of whom, despite all of bitcoin's implications, simply view it as an investment. And in their minds, when its price goes up, its "value" goes up and vice versa.
It's a simplistic view and this sub is filled with those whose understanding is indeed this limited. (And yes, they'll readily take offense at the notion that there's any bigger view to it, especially in how its value is defined.)
What can I say?  For some, thinking outside the box is just business as usual.  For others, it's an impossibility, no matter how well or kindly you try to show them. Most people do not want their views expanded.  And it's threatening to them to have someone suggest they do so. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:31:13
"Hundreds" is unlikely;  "dozens" (or less) is more typical.  And yes, they're hard to prosecute.  Corporate arrangements (of fraud, laundering, etc.) don't just happen overnight.  They're strategised upon months in advance, by teams of lawyers and accountants (many are among the best in their fields) to execute such practices, specifically in ways which are difficult-to-impossible to prosecute.  That’s the whole game.  That’s why a brief sit with these guys (in a consulting capacity) will run you USD$1000 to $15k per hour.  They're not idiots, they know precisely what they’re doing, and what that is worth.  In general, I like these guys, as I like most folks who are good at what they do.  But make no mistake, often what they’re doing is ethically problematic, and when it hurts the casual citizen, it’s a problem.
The vast majority of illicit banking activity happens this way.  99.99%  (Sorry, I can’t cite a study.  Just what my intuition tells me from being raised in a banking family.)  In fact, some might argue that it’s only when there’s a “screw up” that the principals involved are even subjected to prosecutorial review.
The solution in these cases is to pull their corporate charter.  You’re probably aware that when the US established the legality of a public corporation (and in doing so, largely absolved the owners of responsibility) and that the trade-off for this was that a corporation, by law, was required to serve the public interest.  (Hardly a public corporate today gives a dime about the public interest, unless they can spin it into their latest marketing gimmick.)
Send the cases to court, and let a jury of twelve decide if [BofA, Citibank, etc.] is “serving the public interest” when it e.g. recklessly underwrites sub-prime loans.  That would scare the hell out of any exec.  And if this causes some banks to go bankrupt?  I’m sorry to have to tell Americans this (who are generally perceived by the rest of the world to be bullies with sticks and the spines of wimps), that their lovely nation will still survive, and will in time, likely be the better for it.
No, the US regulators won’t go there.  They’re too busy finding cases to prosecute like Charlie Shrem’s or Ross Ulbrecht’s (sp?), or finding a way to squeeze, something as harmless as Bitcoin, into a cage.  Like your comments btw.  1 smile @_date: 2015-05-27 22:40:09

Great input.  A few comments:


I'm happy you capped "could" because that's exactly right as I understand it.  Just our *uni*-verse is beyond my conception.  Multiverses, based not only on what happens, but what "could" have happened, totally beyond me to make sense of in any tangible way.
After a cursory understanding of general and special relativity, which I found pretty fun and fairly comprehensible, I'm at a full loss to gain any further "intuitive" understanding of physics.  Multiverses and aspects of QM and time, have proven very hard to impossible for me to get my head around.  But if there's one thing I've learned, it's to follow the math. Whatever world we live in, it's not that way just because that's what happens to make sense to us little people living in it.
You raise a lot of fascinating questions.  Much food for thought today.  I hope your questions are largely rhetorical though, because the hell if I know the answers to them!  :)
I like your comment about the grain of sand too.  That relates to one of my peeves about sci-fi shows, when they 'go back in time' trying ever so hard to not change anything, so it doesn't *screw up* the future.  A single displacement of a CO^2 molecule would change everything.

Good article.  And now with the advent of multi-signatures, this process will become even more streamlined.

I can envision contracts where an arbitrator holds the third key in a 2/3 multi-sig exchange, or even a jury panel holding nine keys in a 6/11 multi-sig exchange.  Others have taken this far beyond what I can imagine as well, including this young team of programmers who published this amazing concept last week: [Bitcoin Hackathon Winners](

True.  Average home prices here are way out of proportion to most of the developed world.
If I remember correctly for last year, average US home prices (not counting new construction) was around USD $180-200k, putting an average US mortgage at about $1000+/- per month.  With an average US household income of about $60k, that means approximately 20% of peoples' spending is on their housing (before taxes).  Far and away this impacts the average Joe, one hell of a lot more than whether those grains they purchased at the store only when up 2.3% due to inflation.
And this doesn't even include their vehicle, medical expenses, etc.
Point being, the CPI grossly underestimates the real effect of inflation due its excluding of important "basket" items and the repeated manipulation of what's included in the "basket" to begin with.

Alleged. And not in the indictment, which I find interesting.  Furthermore, when a federal or state agency attempts to rally the public with a series of pre-trial releases, the correct response is to be skeptical. Not just believe something because they say it's so. And question:  if they have a rock solid case, why beat their drums to the public anyway.
As a side note, pre-trial news releases, as the prosecutors have been on a tear to get out, are considered by many in law to be unethical, unjust, and simply in poor keeping with any sense of public responsibility.

@_date: 2015-01-31 23:12:09
Good question.
It's an argument used by those who claim Bitcoin's failings, by citing that bitcoin is not a "store of value", and therefore is not "money" per the traditional four-tiered definition.  Bitcoin may very well **not** be a store of money at this time.  (I wouldn't store the entirety my savings in something as volatile as bitcoin.)
However, the arguments lacks two key points.  Firstly, by that definition, then neither is the USD or Euro, or most of the world's other currencies, "money" as well.  None of them are a good store of value.  And secondly, while bitcoin's monetary supply is pre-set, statistically predictable, and likely to behave deflationary, there are no such contexts for nearly all fiat currencies.  In fact, with US and European QE, and dirt-low overnight rates (negative in EU) among the central banks, it's even more likely monetary inflation among fiat currencies will continue—making it even less a "store of value" as we move forward.
@_date: 2015-05-01 04:21:37
Very much so.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:49:57
Kind of, but not really.
Back then, "exporting" (or allowing an international party to download) certain cryptographic software (which had been generating in the US) was illegal, but publishing a webpage or book of that code, was never illegal.
It turned thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans into felons, every time they left the US with their laptops.  Without them ever knowing it.  Fortunately, US border authorities were generally unaware of it as well.
@_date: 2014-09-06 03:04:43
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:20:20
Very true.  And it's worth pointing out that there is such an abundance of laws on the books that all of us--police and prosecutors included--break some laws some of the time.
I recall when BMW was developing plans for a slide-up glass window to partition the driver and passenger seats. (For separate heating/AC ability or to have a private phone call, etc.). BMW quit the concept when the  NTSB informed them it was illegal.  Why?  According to a federal law, when exiting a vehicle, parallel parked on a surface street, it is illegal to exit through the driver's door. The driver is supposed to scoot over to the passenger's side and exit through the passenger's door.  Any obstruction to that process was deemed illegal.  Who knew that every American who drives is most likely in violation of that law.

A world of confused physicists is awaiting your explanation.  I should book a lecture tour for you, because many of us have been questioning how a couple entangled particles change their spin at the exact time regardless of distance.
At least now we know they're not communicating, so we can check that off the list.  Tell me, at the instant they switch spin, is the space between them reducing to zero and then back again?  Or is it happening in time-frames we're unaware of?  Or are particles not at all what we currently think of them as?

Thanks.  I've read those first two links, (the white paper I had to read several times initially).  The last link you posted seems like stuff I'm already familiar with now, but I didn't give it a thorough read.
I should clarify since this is r/bitcoin.  I'm comfortable with my level of understanding, and based upon comments read on r/bitcoin I'm not comforted by the level of understanding in general.  But this is also a far cry from someone who fully understands it.  And when folks like Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Andresen are knowledgeable and humble enough to say that even *they* don't fully understand bitcoin, then I have to take a step back, and appreciate the scope of what’s involved here.
The key is in the use of language, specifically my use of "fully understand."  At this stage of the game, there is so much to bitcoin, (the protocol, the types of encryption used, the incentivisation of different actors in the space, the economic and social concerns, and the metrics describing all this) that few people, if any, are experts at bitcoin as a whole.
Even parts of the code have shown to have significant ramifications that I suspect Satoshi herself was unaware of.  For example, who would have thought that one could brute-force the master record of certain wallets (provided partial knowledge of the password exists), allowing one to unlock the wallet, while still forfeiting the ability to spend those coins?  When Dave over at [Wallet Recovery Services]( first mentioned this, he was scoffed at, until Mike Caldwell came along and verified it was possible.  Or who would have thought that multi-sig would have all the implications it does, including the degree to which it’s now been demonstrated, to be able to [increase pre-block security](
My point is, it’s quite an ecosystem and growing rapidly.  For anyone to claim they *fully understand* bitcoin, is arrogant in my opinion.

@_date: 2015-08-04 07:29:19
Ahh.  Long one to explain.  Someone asks about this every 3 months or so, and to date it remains unanswered.  (I should say many have offered partial solutions, but most don't seem to understand the question fully to appropriately answer.)   Let me look up the time I asked about it:
To begin with, let's clear some facts.  Bitcoin's monetary supply is increasing, and is expected to increase for the next ~125 years.  However, I'll define bitcoin as deflationary (as most do) since the demand is currently at ~$1m/day, and has increased relative to other currencies since inception.  And in a world whereby everyone were to be using bitcoin, I think it's fair to say the price would be substantially more than its current price.
So to get to the point, people will always need to take loans, whether for buying a house, cars, a business, etc. But doing so in a deflationary currency (as I expect bitcoin to continue to behave) could prove to be particularly painful, especially over a long-term loan.  I, certainly, am much happier that my home mortgage is in fiat, instead of BTC.
But if large-scale loans, like mortgages, were denominated in bitcoin, what would that look like?
To remain competitive in this context, banks lending in BTC could lower their interest rates, effectively compensating for the deflation. And just as banks estimate the ROI of their loans relative to inflation, they could equally do so, relative to deflation. If deflation were to be particularly extreme, one might imagine a competitive bank offering a negative interest rate.  (Not unlike Switzerland or the ECB have done.)  But this is where this idea seems to break down. Would a consumer-facing bank ever have the incentive to offer a negative interest rate loan, when they could just keep the BTC instead for a higher growth rate? More broadly, can effective lending happen in a highly deflationary currency?
The whole concept of lending in a deflationary currency seems to break down at the point where the debtor's risk factor is sufficiently low, that their assigned interest rate is less than the rate of deflation.  Think about it or do the math.  And for what it's worth, Chris Larsen has said it's impossible.  Let's prove him wrong, if in fact, he is wrong.
For much of AD history, gold (typically though of as deflationary as well) has been a popular currency.  So I can’t imagine that this issue has not been faced before.  But I don’t know what the solutions were, or whether they’re applicable to the degree of deflation, a worldwide Bitcoin currency could create.
TL;DR example:  Why would a bank ever make a 5% loan in a 10% depreciating currency, when fractional reserve lending isn't an option?
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:15:47
They sure do.  Folks like to think of the Bitcoin protocol as some sort of utopian democracy where everyone has some say.  That will come to an abrupt end when serious conflicts of interest occur between the miners and any other interested parties.

Agreed, and no one would contest that each of them are Bitcoin experts.  But the dozen or so experts that constitute this group is far too few to draw any meaningful conclusions from, or to use the majority of their opinion to justify a position.
I like the concept you employed of flaring some users, but this group should consist of at least 60, if not over 100 experts who are selected by the community.
Personally, I think this would be a fun project for a team to put together a consensus-driven mechanism for polling subscribers as to their recommendations for entry into such an expert list.  For purposes of integrity, the team doing this should be autonomous, and not beholden to any one mod (yourself included) or the mods as a whole.
Taking measures such as described above, would give this body of experts the integrity, backed by the community, to speak with authority.  It would also allow you and others to draw from their conclusions regarding such issues like the block increase.


This may very well be the case.  I've certainly heard this from others as well.  But we need to know for certain and in a way that's independent of any single person making this claim.  The test of "I think that in all of them..." underlines two problems.  One is the uncertainty of it.  The other is that it's too important to be left to a single person (in this case, yourself) to make that decision.  This is the core of decentralization theory.  Your role should be to foster the growth of a healthy community, which is a role that requires holding a larger, more universal viewpoint, than that of jumping into the fray and debating the issues directly.  Let the community do that.  And foster that discussion.  And when possible, help provide metrics (such as a body of flaired experts) so that the community can arrive at the answers they're looking for.
By the way, it's very appreciated, and is testament to your confidence and potential that you're even here discussing this.  It hasn't gone unnoticed.  And I thank you for that.  Consider the above.

By the way, I've been meaning to ask you: do you dislike the userbase?  I'm not trying to be rude in asking.  I'm genuinely curious and a bit confused.  I came across an earlier post you made on and it sounded like you did, and I've felt a bit unsure about you ever since.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Or if it's too much to deal with right now, please feel free to ignore this question.  Here was the post in question:

Of course.  I'm always surprised at how folks on this sub seem to think otherwise.
Until Bitcoin can offer an easy-to-use revolving credit line and insurance against fraud, credit cards certainly have their place.  And while credit cards function under a variety of currencies, there's nothing to suggest they couldn't be denominated in bitcoin as well.

Yes.  Perhaps others here are hoping the federal government would respect states' rights more, and the clear, propositioned mandate of their people, but I don't see the fed gov doing that anytime soon.
Even in states where civil forfeiture has been made illegal, the fed has been conducting busts in those states seizing civil assets under their supposed claim of jurisdiction.  Thankfully, the whitehouse has issued some handwaving suggesting this might end soon, but I'll believe it when I see it. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 03:35:26
Well, that's a fair point.  I'd exercise caution though with using the terms "prove" and also "immutable".
The Bitcoin block chain is immutable to the degree a mining pool doesn't gain 51% control and then decide to start rolling back blocks.
"Prove" can be tough to justify, regardless of evidence.
In general though, I share your sentiment.  I think they should call it something else, and perhaps say it was *inspired* by Bitcoin's advancements.

Nope, never works.  Adorable concept, but people *extremely rarely* ever change their beliefs after hearing a few good opposing arguments.  As much as people like to debate this, that and everything in between, polls have consistently found that arguments don't sway opinion.  They only help to further substantiate opinions already held.
And if you question this, just ask yourself.  What arguments would convince you to raise the block limit (as an example)?  You will have, by this time, heard all of them.  Leaving the word "none" to be your most honest answer.  Chalk it up to human nature and move on, but don't pretend that this represents a valid avenue to change your identified "policies".

I'm guessing XT won't make 75% node adoption and therefore (by its own rule set) won't get enacted.  But if it did, big deal.  We need to move the block cap sooner or later regardless.  ***But not being able to discuss it*** as an option, is why folks are up in arms here.

That's a good point.
Bruce Schneier's remark (quoted in pic above) holds true for a brute force attack against SHA-256.  Even I'm told, against a quantum-computing (QC) brute force attack.  Unfortunately, our RIPEMD-160 and sept256k1 curve will likely not be so fortunate against a QC attack.  Thankfully they are replaceable within the protocol.
But if/when SHA-256 is broken, it will certainly be due to some kid envisioning an entirely new approach to the related maths.

You should be able to tell by my tone that I'm more familiar with the BitLicense than I'd ever hope to be.  Was that not already evident or did you just miss that?  Check the KYC parts and read what is says *for yourself.*  Quit being a lazy ass.  Read the reg like the rest of us have had to.  Better yet, comprehend it as well, if that's possible for you.

Legal writing is a little different than everyday verbiage.  Certain things are specifically defined in context, especially in how conjunctions are used.  If I have time tomorrow, I'll try to answer this in more detail.  (I know it seems as if it can be correct in either context on first glance.)

Serious question:  have you read the BitLicense?
I ask because, if it boiled down to issues such as the one you cited above, there'd be no controversy to it.
In a very practical way, the BitLicense creates a skewed playing field disadvantaging any business subject to it.  This is particularly relevant since the very industry that the Bitcoin protocol has the most potential to disrupt—the banking sector—is immune from its regulations.
As an example, can you imagine the push-back the NYDFS would have received from the banking lobby if every new product, service or "activity" that they were to conduct, had to first receive written approval from the Super himself prior to such roll-outs?  
(Not to mention the 4-10 week estimated turn-around time per decision.)
Under no circumstances, would the banking industry would find that tenable.  And yet a Bitcoin startup, trying to compete against them, they are required to do so.
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:06:00
If you could provide some solid evidence of this, I'd love to see it.  Currently, we know for sure where the five core devs stand (mostly low limit), and we know pretty sure where theymos' flaired experts stand (mostly low limit also), but getting a larger pool of experts and accurately understanding their positions would be invaluable imho.
@_date: 2015-08-15 07:34:08
What if they're not handling your money?  What if a startup serves only its own tokens?  Or only trades among other crypto-currencies?  Or deals in tokens not related to any store of value?  Or simply issues a crypto-token as an account management process?  What about HDRs and multisig?  Provably fair odds or provable reserves?
Why should businesses looking to integrate any of these concepts  be subject to the BitLicense?
From what I can tell, very few Redditors have actually read it.

@_date: 2015-08-04 04:47:10


Are you trying to de-escalate or escalate this?
Regardless of who's model is better suited, it's going to be a long and rocky road to anyone to reach an *un-buggy* point of wide-adoption.
And while clearly there's plenty of disagreement to go around, claiming (by exclusion) there is not another person with "real research experience" who's involved in decentralized PMs, discredits at the very least Paul Sztorc's work, if not a few others.  Do you sincerely believe Sztorc's research experience at Yale fails to meet the test of even to be considered "real"?
If you want to succeed, there'll be a dozen more such battles, against far more difficult "foes" that you'll have to let drop, in order to succeed.

Actually, not really.  It's not meaningful to represent the value of an asset by its own value nomenclature, unless someone is trying to make the silly point that the value of the Bitcoin market is worth 14.5m BTC (current value of Bitcoin expressed in bitcoin).

A 51% attack can easily happen, even without malicious intent.  As miners put more and more hashing power online, they're not exactly aware of what other mining pools are putting online at the same time.
It's kind of a poisson distribution problem.  If one of the major pools were to receive their latest shipment of new asics, (say it was an order of 10,000 mining rigs) running at the highest level of efficiency currently available, they may inadvertently reach 51%.  Further compounding this problem is that the data (and popular pie-charts) describing the current hashing distribution is really not that accurate, and as always there's a high degree of variance based on the mechanics of finding blocks.
When ghash.io appeared to have greater than 51% control, it's unlikely they actually did, outside of the standard variance that temporarily pushed them over the 51% mark.
If any pool reaches a true majority, it will build a positive feedback loop further solidifying their control.  It's unlikely the users would even be aware of this as diversifying the mining pool names and IPs is trivial.

But I like your thought process there.  It opens up all sorts of creative possibilities.  The next time I quote something about Bitcoin, I might as well just poll my mum's knitting circle girlfriends and quote them.

So above you wrote:


According to the BitLicense, it's for any company operating anywhere in the world, that has at least one customer in NY.
(Incidentally, this isn't new to Bitcoin.  Banks have had the same requirement under NY regulation for awhile, which is why you may have heard of some foreign banks not supporting New York and—more recently—US clients.)
Furthermore, if a business has a NY customer, that business is supposed to apply NY's version of KYC and AML controls (and in some cases BSA and SAR as well) on ALL its customers, regardless of their nationality, and be able to provide that documentation to the NYDFS for up to 10 years from the date of last transaction.
This is why I mentioned earlier that the BitLicense pertains to a whole slew of people.

I disagree with this part.  Several folks I think of as experts are also:
1.  Intimitely familiar with the code and simply choose to not write BIPs; or:
2.  Have a thorough understanding of how the protocol functions and can offer:
* Strategic
* Legal
* Statistical analysis
* Economic
* Theoretical
* Political
* Management
* Cryptographic
* Marketing
...input without necessarily knowing how to code.
I hate to cite Steve Jobs as an example, but the value he contributed to Apple was immense, but never technical.
As Bitcoin grows, no one will be an expert at everything.  The core-devs will write the core code that everything else connects to, but network engineers will address the networking side, mining engineers will build and maintain the hashing mines, SPV engineers will tie their networks into the block chain, etc.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:10:11
What concerns me more are the conjunctions to the following clauses:




requirements otherwise applicable under this Part: 




Read correctly, the BitLicense as it currently stands, exempts only merchants who happen to also be consumers, who happen to also have a banking charter, who are also approved by the NYDFS.
Good going Lawsky!  Your parents and I knew that eighth-grade English class you took, would serve you well.  Kidding, of course.
But on a more serious note, these guys do know exactly what they're doing, and regulations today are often written like this.  They're written to cast an enormously wide net, allowing for virtually anything to fall under some degree of violation.  This helps the regulators cover all their bases, while allowing them to cherry-pick cases for prosecution while letting other cases slip by.  It essentially grants them czar-like levels of governance in the space.
**Two Examples:**
If a cute, little, clean (and non-threatening) Bitcoin startup comes along (like ChangeTip for example) regulators can take the stance of "Oh, you're fine.  Don't worry about trying to adhere to every little coordinating conjunction of speech as written in the BitLicense.  You've been approved."  They can then chalk up the BitLicense language to some small drafting error or just a matter of grammatical interpretation.
(For those who are educated (read lawyers and judges) this is not a matter of subjective interpretation.  It's clearly evident.)
If/when some threatening, dark-matter, recalcitrant Bitcoin startup comes along—who may be following all the other requirements of the BitLicense properly—the NYDFS can chose to tighten the noose, relying on a strict interpretation of each word, as written, in the BitLicense.  Putting an end to the business or never affording them the NY license to begin with.
In most cases, the use of "and" conjunctions like this won't hold up in court.  And it's safe to assume the NYDFS' lawyers know this.  But they also most certainly know what everyone knows: that they can shut down nearly any startup simply by filing charges.  (Unless a startup happens to have half a mill lying around for a legal defense, they're out of luck.)
***TL;DR: BitLicense too sneaky for its own good.***

The trolls aren't shouting down 2MB blocks.  That's a fundamental misunderstand that apparently shares with you.
This is a divisive subject among users.  Most haven't spent the time to understand the technical details, (myself included) and I'm sure even many Bitcoin experts aren't certain of the ramifications such changes with create.
But whether or not we can discuss it, is what's important here, and it's why I disagree with the way has addressed it.
The trolls on this sub are more than apparent.  And their comments are plentiful, but not especially based on bigger blocks.  This is actually a user debate, in my opinion.
I'd love to be proven wrong, so we can just move-on.  Because that would certainly make this discussion easier and validate actions.  But there's no evidence for either side of the argument, that this is the case.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:02:39
That's true, but only because if you count financial scams conducted in fiat currencies, around the planet, they'd be so numerous, and of such high value amounts, it would be impossible to measure.

* Free checking
* Membership rewards programs
* Special offers
* ATM fee reimbursement
*without* requiring prior written approval from the NYDFS' superintendent.
And as for "activities" it's anyone's guess as to how that's defined.  (It's not defined in the BitLicense, as you're supposedly aware of.)  So what is the point of such wording?  From being familiar with substantial bodies of regulation, I know exactly why it's included.  Do you?
And as for MTBs,  everything Bitcoin-related now falls under—at a minimum—this umbrella.  Even non-custodial fiat exchanges, who are traditionally exempt, are ***not*** if they're trading in cryptos.

Yes, but IMHO, that's really not an "innovative" step forward.  It's more of an incremental and blatantly obvious mechanical move, like plodding one step forward in front of the other in a long march.  Frankly, I'm surprised it took them as long as it did to even implement it.
On the other hand, Bitcoin is truly a new technology, with stakes that question the very foundation of economics and how we "think" money works.  It furthermore raises the question as to whether money is simply a content-type, or a layer of language itself. 
To the degree that Facebook becomes attached to their debit card tokening system, is the degree to which they are even more likely to miss the potential in Bitcoin.

With Bitcoin, more so than ever before, we have money as a content type.  Trying to limit the dissemination of it, is akin to limiting people's freedom of speech.
The US is particularly well protected against this, since to the extent one defines Bitcoin as money, it becomes protected under the US Supreme Court's ruling on money being a form of free speech.  See [Citizens United v. FEC](

Anyway, the article was obviously written in a light, playful manner for popular audiences, but yes, the facts of it are correct.

This is one of my major concerns with the protocol.  A mining pool will reach 51% control at some point.
I believe there are too many positive feedback loops in support of this for it to not happen.  If this happens, the pool will begin receiving most block awards, and eventually all block awards.  Other mining pools will be forced to drop out.  It's unlikely we (users) would even be aware of this happening as the pool can disguise itself under several names and IPs.
My guess is that such a pool would take considerable measures to maintain their privacy (as some pools already do) and to best satisfy their customers (we, users), by offering very low or free transaction costs and timely propagation.  At the current price of bitcoin, such a mining pool would be earning about $1m per day.
Once their mining competition dropped out, they could effectively lower the difficulty rate, raising their ROI considerably by providing *just enough* difficulty to make it not worth it for competition to enter the space.  (By the way, a growing difficulty rate should be considered a sign of healthy competition among miners.)
This will possibly happen the next time a manufacturing plant makes some significant step forward in hardware (possibly at the 8nm stage coming in a few years), and decides that instead of selling their chips, to simply use them to mine bitcoin instead.

Take the most number of transactions that can fit in an 8MB block (about 18,200), multiply that by the average transaction fee (0.0001 BTC), and it still pales in comparison to even orphaning one block.
As a miner, you'd have to risk receiving 25 btc for a found block, in order to hopefully gain an extra 1.8 btc.

Coin Center believes that in lieu of AB-1326 passing, Bitcoin will be subject to California's more stringent *Money Transmission Act* and I understand their concern.
The issue I take with this, is that I'm uncertain that is ***necessarily*** the case.
The argument needs to be made that the Bitcoin protocol is just that—a ***protocol***.  A use of language.  More specifically, an agreed-upon set of rules whereby parties may exchange information.  That 'information' ***may*** represent a value, a proof, a simple statement, a domain name, even a [DNS certificate](  But more importantly, that information is ***not limited*** to describing 'a value' or any of the other examples I just cited.  Anything can be represented through a cryptographic token.
Furthermore, even when every attempt is made at ensuring that a given set of information remain "valueless", market forces can insist that a monetary value be applied.  This has occasionally been the case with testnet coins, whereby folks will on occasion buy &amp; sell testnet coins, only to have the developers have to reset the network to avoid them becoming a commodity of value in and of themselves.
Lastly, the concepts at play that created Bitcoin, can equally function outside of Bitcoin's network.  And one can argue outside of the internet, and even outside of a digital medium.  If one can communicate a cryptographically signed message via oral communication, radio transmission or even smoke signal, we need to re-consider what is actually taking place.  Is this really "money transmission"?  Perhaps not, if no value is assigned.  But what if someone (even at a later time) were to place a value on such messages?  Would it then be considered money transmission and subject to all the regulation that defines that?  And how is that different than if I were to publish some information (such as a book) that at some point others were to trade for value?
At the heart of it, Bitcoin presents something new.  And it's important to fundamentally understand what's taking place, before rushing to regulate.  In rushing to legislation, we risk the alienation of users and qualify the freedoms we like to think we enjoy.

Good point, but it was early than '94 or '93 that the net was available to the public.  IIRC, I was given an email address in '87 (and I wasn't doing anything specific to research or defence at that time).
So perhaps it was the mid-'80s when the NSF opened it up.

If you feel like investing in Bitcoin, invest only a small amount, and be prepared to hold it for a long time.  It has the potential to go up *a lot*, but equally so, you could lose all you invest.  It's highly, highly volatile. (Not for the faint of heart.)
But if you like playing a little bit with the market, or if you're into penny stock trading, then there's a place to have a little fun with bitcoin as well.

I'm not sure if it becomes illegal or not, based merely on suspicions.
But ethically, I wouldn't sell to them.
Pimps are almost always very abusive to their ladies, and you don't know ***who*** they're pimping.  You certainly wouldn't want it to be a minor.
Lastly—and this might come as a surprise—most pimps never pay their ladies.  Their ladies are expected to work for free for the pimp while he collects all payments.  In exchange, he might provide a place for her to crash at, occasional food/drugs, and limited protection.
It's not a good thing to support IMHO.
Escorts are an entirely different world.
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:59:11
Mixed feelings.
Agreed that the network effect towards a single ledger is huge, especially as serving a store of value.  But then again, a lot of folks (including corporations) have made it clear that they can't use a coin that's as transparent as Bitcoin.  So perhaps some of the alts this guy is predicting are coins like Dash or Monero, which can be immediately swapped in and out for BTC.
In any event, it's likely the distribution will heavily weight Bitcoin with a rapidly falling curve for the others.  Similar to our current distribution.

Demand won't be increasing by that much per day anytime in the near future.  If real mass adoption occurs eventually, it will likely follow an exponential growth curve.  Something in the ballpark of doubling per 6 months is not uncommon for a growing tech.
If worldwide M3 is at about $60t and bitcoin began doubling every 6 months, it would take about 7 years to reach that level of value.  Of course, there's a ton of other factors that would affect it as well, and Bitcoin isn't a direct replacement for M3.  M2 is probably a better measure in general.

For the strictly fundamentalist Muslim, who is trying their best to adhere to the rules of Shari'a law, fiat may present problems simply by its issuance.
In the US for example, fiat is created when Treasury issues a bond and then sells it to the Federal Reserve who issue US dollars to pay for it.  The Fed then *collects on the subsequent interest* from that bond.
If Shari'a law forbids interest, then conventional fiat (generated as a form of debt) may be problematic for their *true believers.*

A bank's choice to participate in the FDIC is purely voluntary.  Banks pay a monthly premium to be a member, and in exchange receive limited insurance.
You may have noticed that the last letter in FDIC stands for "corporation" for whatever that's worth to you, and that enrolling banks proudly post an FDIC "Member Bank" sign or sticker if they're a member.
Banks typically carry several forms of insurance, FDIC membership being only one of them.


Sorry.  $40b in allocatable reserves is peanuts these days—particularly for the US economy.  And the FDIC has repeatedly made public warnings that in the event of a serious issue, it has nowhere near the ability to cover up to $250k for every account that has $250k or more of savings in it.
And lastly, FWIW, most American's "savings" isn't even stored in a savings or checking account, and is not even covered by FDIC insurance to begin with.

Hey throwahoymatie.  I may be mixing up the mining pools, but as I recall it was AntPool and F2Pool that are in the same building.  It was mentioned by one of the owners/operators in one of the recent videos out of China.  It was posted here on Reddit within the last ~3-10 weeks, but damn me if I'm going to try to find it using Reddit's search tool.  I tried a YouTube search for it, but without the video being keyword tagged, it's a needle in a haystack.  If you know a better way to search for it, let me know.  I'd like to see it again just to ensure I'm recalling the correct two mining pools.
As for BW.com, very little is known about miner.  It could well belong to another mining group.
Same goes for "Unknown" in the pie chart.  It's not a category exclusive to other miners.  It's simply not known.

Correct.  No charges are made against you.  Only against the money or "inanimate object" (Yes, it's *that* weird).


Actually, it's you who has to sue the governing agency to get your money back.  If you want legal representation, then you have to hire your own attorney.  None is afforded to you as in a criminal case.
By suspicion, the money is considered guilty, and it is up to you to prove it is not.
Some municipalities have set up fast-track process to help you recover your funds if you have a reasonably strong case.  (In reality, this is more likely a process put into effect to save the government money from defending a long case, that they'll likely lose.)

One party is required to have residence in NY, and when that's the case, a bunch of KYC kicks in, affecting users of other nations (which FinCen and the NYDFS have long considered part of their jurisdiction, even if they can't practice enforcement there) who have nothing to do with NY.
Then again, this is r/bitcoin.  And I realise that most of you lack the ability to read before commenting.

Pools are made of up individual operators.  Sometimes many, someone just one.
In the case of the former, individuals who don't like a pool's policy can direct their hashing power to another pool, or if extremely disgruntled, stay with the pool they're at and refuse to publish any found blocks.
In the case of the latter, there's not much that can be done.  One can only hope they'd act rationally and realise that when transactions don't clear, people stop using the network and the value of their entire mining operation becomes worth less (not worthless).

Actually, Bitcoin is backed by two things, each of which is a bit too subtle for mainstream media (or typical economists) to pick up on.
Firstly, it's backed by the fact that no central authority controls it or can manipulate its value.  It shares this quality with only other forms of hard money, such as gold, or commodities.
Secondly, Bitcoin is backed by its utility.  In our digital age, it can perform certain functions that are impossible through other means, even after the digitization of conventional currencies.  This is a unique advantage.

INAL, but from what you've said, ***at the time of the trade*** you were unaware that they may have been pimps.
Furthermore, as a non-MSB, I don't believe that it is your burden to ensure who your customers may or may not have been.  If you want to adopt KYC procedures, then feel free to do so.  Personally, I would.  It may also be helpful to those who buy bitcoin from you in the future, to state your preference for some level of KYC in advance as well.

Yea, spam was already becoming a problem before the e-commerce floodgates were lifted.  (But only about 1 spam per week then.)  Many thought it would get a lot worse, and it did.

Not really.  Andreas Antonopoulos's remark that a malicious actor would get booted off the network is easier said than done.  For better or worse, one of Bitcoin's greatest—if not its single greatest—strength is its censorship resistance.  But this cuts both ways.  
Getting a bad actor off the network would require the remaining miners and nodes to work in unison to manually block IPs, creating a game of cat and mouse, as the bad actor would jump from IP to IP.  It possibly could break the protocol trying to censor them.
I really hope my assessment is wrong here.  And if someone with more knowledge than me would like to jump in here and point out any flaws in my logic, I'd love to hear from them.

Ha!  I see the trolls found this thread today.  And from the comments, it seems they chose to disregard the OP's statement "disregarding moral arguments".
So apart from all moral arguments, one negative consequence is the negative effect this would have on someone's credit report.  Whether denominated in dollars, euros or bitcoin, loans will continue to be necessary, and credit reports provide the primary means of assessing an individual's credit worthiness.  And credit reports don't care which state you live in, or which currency you transact in.
Additionally, to the extent that everyone does their best to repay their student loans, it helps keep the price competitive for students as a whole.  (Granted this argument might fall under the moral argument category.)

From the very brief, and probably incorrect description, given here by RT, it sounds like yet another altcoin.  Sometimes, folks need things like this as an on-ramp though.  Once they get use to it, they may look around and find better options, namely one not controlled by their bank alone.

Oops; I should have clarified.  Please don't take what I said as a commentary on Bitcoin writers specifically.  
I don't hire writers (re: Bitcoin or any other subject matter).  I hire a freelance contractors on occasion for a variety of projects, just not writers.
Based on the lack of quality writing I find in the Bitcoin space, my guess is that most writers are paid virtually nothing.  Then again, many professional outfits don't pay any more for real writers either.
Since papers like *USA Today* came out (mid-'80s), it's been a pretty rapid race to the bottom, dragging even the WSJ and NYT down from their once vaunted pedestals.
I'd be all over a good Bitcoin publication if there was one.  But I don't see it happening any time soon, and especially not until people are willing to pay for that which good quality is worth.

I like to use Bitcoin to tip content creators on YouTube when I like their work.
I feel this is the right thing to do.  It also encourages them (if others start tipping them like I do) to avoid putting ads in their videos (which I can't stand).
Sometimes I pay for things online with Bitcoin.  When I use Newegg.com or Expedia, it's easier for me to point my phone at the code on my computer screen and press 'send', than it is to go get my wallet and type in my 16-digit CC number.
I also like the fact that Bitcoin is a grass-roots, fully-independent, open-source project, owned by everyone.  That's how money should be.  It's too important not to be.  In the old days, gold or silver coins served this function well.  And it was impossible for any one government to control the 'monetary supply'.  Today, things are different, as all typical currency is controlled by central banks, which in turn are owned and controlled by regular banks.  It's not common knowledge, and it's a lot to explain, so I won't go into it any further.  Take care.

That's certainly an option.  Of course, large scale double-spends will quickly out a 51% pool as being such, leading to distrust and collapse of the currency.  This is definitely an option for the malicious attacker who's goal isn't to profit, but to destroy.
For your average attacker, the profit model for them would be to continue to milk the 3600btc per day reward.  I would estimate 2 weeks (1 month tops) before all remaining miners would either point their hashing power to the dominant pool, or drop out.  With the difficulty re-targeting, and the competition out, the dominant pool could continue to lower their hashing rate (cutting on their power bill) reaping further profits.
A dominant mining pool doing as such would be likely to keep their users (us) very happy, until their domination is firmly secured.  At that point, transaction fees would likely increase.
Bitcoin is an amazing breakthrough in so many ways, it's tough to grapple with, but we shouldn't overlook its problems.

Assuming Backpage is properly US incorporated, they need to evaluate bringing an action against the DOJ or the governing authority that recommended to MasterCard, Visa, etc. this course of action.
Since the courts are leaning more and more towards the full interpretation of a corporation being a "person" this may be considered defamation of character or slander. The fact of the matter is that if the DOJ has a legitimate case to bring against Backpage, they need to either press charges or let them be.
This grey-zone of surrupticiously pressuring corporations into compliance to a "better" world as they imagine it, is both illegal and unethical IMHO.  This is not due process.  Bring charges based on the body of law the legislature has enacted, or drop it.
I hope Backpage stands up for their rights both as a corporation and as the courts' recent interpretations (last 20+ years) of what a corporation is.

There's only one rational scenario I know of where a miner would pass on the award, and that's when the miner purposefully doesn't publish their found block. As when a member of a mining pool becomes concerned over the relative size of their own mining pool.
When Ghash.io briefly (and it's debatable that they even did) surpassed 50% of the network's total hashing power in 2014, some miners left to join other mining pools to re-balance the network.  In effect, this helped ensure the security for users, as a whole.
In addition, at least one miner, in this situation, continued to mine at Ghash's pool, but refused to transmit any found blocks his equipment found.  This can have a greater affect against the mining pool, than simply re-directing one's hashing rate to another pool.  Again, this helps the network, as a whole, maintain a decentralised level of security, at the expense of the pool in question finding as many new blocks, than it otherwise would have.
Once Ghash lost &gt;50% of hashing control, I believe that miner either switched to another pool, or continued pointing his hashing power to Ghash, publishing found blocks as normal.
Any miner or pool that accumulates &gt;20% control, can lead to certain types of attacks, be them rational or not.  Making the situation worse, is that mining pool statistics are notoriously unreliable, as well as contain a high degree of variance.

Of course, but unfortunately many juries (despite the judge's specific instructions) hear this is as "Is the defendant more likely to be guilty or innocent?"  Furthmore, countless cases have had considerable jury bias in an assortment of contexts. I, for one, would hate to be charged with a crime in the US' deep South.
And yes, throwing in some *terrorist* charges, such as "terrorist threats" which can be added to virtually any crime with little-to-no evidence, further scare juries into leaning on the prosecutions side.  Not to mention that if real terrorist charges are made, several rights are no longer afforded the defendant from the get-go.

Sure, but to find the number of actual users, we would need to find out how many store their value off-chain as well, such as that typically held at exchanges, (while remembering that we're not looking for MAUs or even "active" users).  Just total users period.
Coinbase alone is currently publishing that it has 2.4m "users".  Not "accounts".  And offhand, I know several who (despite my wishes), continue to hold their BTC value at Coinbase (off-chain).

Historically, it's a relatively new "crime" as well.  For thousands of years, things we call "laundering" today were simply standard practices one utilized to protect one's own wealth.
Then in the 1930s the US introduced money-laundering laws, and citizens were expected to do something they never had to do before with their own money:  they had to structure their own transactions in such ways that were not in their own best interest, but that satisfied this new body of law.
Eventually, the IRS caught on to this and enacted a new ruling called "structuring"—a seizable offence, whereby even those ***trying to be compliant*** could have all their funds seized.  Not just the funds that were considered to be "structured."  And not just the funds that would have represented the IRS' fair proportion of taxes, but all savings a person held.
The initial body of money laundering law specifically defined it as money gained from crime.  That definition has now morphed into money gained, transferred or spent in any suspicious manner.

Assuming Backpage is properly US incorporated, they need to evaluate bringing an action against the DOJ or the governing authority that recommended to MasterCard, Visa, etc. this course of action.
Since the courts are leaning more and more towards the full interpretation of a corporation being a "person" this may be considered defamation of character or slander. The fact of the matter is that if the DOJ has a legitimate case to bring against Backpage, they need to either press charges or let them be.
This grey-zone of surrupticiously pressuring corporations into compliance to a "better" world as they imagine it, is both illegal and unethical IMHO.  This is not due process.  Bring charges based on the body of law the legislature has enacted, or drop it.
I hope Backpage stands up for their rights both as a corporation and as the courts' recent interpretations (last 20+ years) of what a corporation is.

Lawsky played right into the hands of the banking lobby without ever even realizing it.
And while he and the bankers congratulate themselves over a "reasoned and balanced" approach, "incorporating the concerns of the people [users]" the resulting regulation tells the truth:  it does everything to protect banks and everything to make launching a bitcoin startup in NY nearly impossible, reaching far beyond even federal requirements of KYC and AML.
For example, what bank, MSB or payment network has to file in advance—and get approval for—any new products or services they plan to offer?  If Lawsky knew how any startup worked, he'd understand that requirement is impossible to adhere to.  And imagine the push back, if he had tried to make banks live up to the same requirement?  They wouldn't tolerate it for a moment, and would probably attempt to get Lawsky pushed out of office for even suggesting it.  (Of course, he exempted banks from the bitLicence entirely.)
My written questions to the NYDFS remain unanswered.  As did my request for their research and analysis, which they are required to provide to the public in accordance with their office's own rules.  I doubt anyone other than some poor group of interns even read the vast quantity of emails sent to Ben Lawsky or Dana Syracuse.  Certainly, none of the public's many concerns reached any meaningful inclusion into the bitLicence.
In the end, what his office produced was public theatre, for the benefit of the bankers with virtually no public input affecting the regulation.
No.  Lawsky is a hack.  This is his legacy.  And he created it for himself.

Oh I see your point.  So a 402 is an HTTP status code.  The HTTP protocol didn't come out until 1991, about 19-22 years after the beginning of the net (depending on how you define when it exactly started).  The code was a good forethought however, as commerce wasn't allowed until a little while later.  I don't recall the date the ban was lifted.  It could have been as early as 1991, but I think it was closer to '94-'95.
Someone writing for Wired claims it was '95.  I think he's right.

FWIW, the FDIC is a private corporation, forced into existence by Congress.  It's only funded up to about $40b.  So good luck.  Plus, if you read the list of FDIC exclusions (what it won't cover in the event of a loss) they're as long as my arm.
Thankfully, most banks supplement their FDIC insurance with various forms of insurance from other insurers.  However, each of these insurers have their own get-out-of-paying loopholes as well.  An no entity in the US can cover losses as a result of a true panic.
Also, the US does not control its own monetary supply.  Since 1913, Treasury is limited to only minting physical coins.  The bills you use belong to the Federal Reserve.  Only the value those bills represent belongs to you.

Catching up with old mail here;  please excuse this belated reply.
A quick note about bandwidth vs. throughput though, since this is an incredibly common misconception.  Throughput is actually bandwidth * (1 / latency).  The misconception is subtle as you'll see.  Think of bandwidth as how wide a pipe is.  For example a water pipe.  The wider the pipe, the more water (i.e. data) can be transmitted through it per minute.  This is "bandwidth."  And you can see why it's tempting to leave it at that since it seems to be a straight forward data over time equation (which typically equals speed).  But there's more.  Latency (i.e. ping) is how slow that water is actually moving.  In plumbing this would equate to pressure (or voltage if you're into electrical stuff).  So the pipe width (bandwidth) might accommodate 1 gallon per minute if drained by gravity.  But if you were to force the water down, faster than its normal drain rate, you can get more water through the same pipe size per that same given minute.  In essence latency is the actual speed of a single piece of data, whereas bandwidth is how much data can be transferred per that speed.
Both latency and bandwidth are critical.  Consumer ISPs don't advertise based on latency because it's difficult for them to determine what your latency will be, and its hard for them to regulate it (for different payment schemes) like they can with bandwidth.
So both are important, but not fully interchangeable.  If you're downloading movies and big files, then bandwidth is better for you.  But if you're just hitting up a bunch of websites as part of your work, or playing an online first-person shooter then low latency is what counts.
Disregarding up and down rates, most professionals and businesses will prefer a lower bandwidth, but with lower latency (faster ping) connection than a higher bandwidth, but with higher latency (slower speed) connection.  The reason being that for most internet use, what makes the most difference to the user, is lower latency.
Here's someone else's example:






Here's a paper written about it by a Stanford student back in '96 (never mind his paper's title):
His key analogy being:


Would you say that a Boeing 747 is three times "faster" than a Boeing 737? Of course not. They both cruise at around 500 miles per hour. The difference is that the 747 carries 500 passengers where as the 737 only carries 150. The Boeing 747 is three times bigger than the Boeing 737, not faster.














So that was a brief note about bandwidth vs. latency.  Thanks for your above reply.  Sorry I don't have time to address the rest of your post, except that so far, I remain unconvinced by the arguments against faster block confirmation times as posted in this thread.  Be well.

From what I've heard about this:
The network does not automatically forget a transaction at some point in time.  It's an undefined state.  Folks are still thinking about possible solutions to this one.  One thing that can be done is to double-spend it to the same address and see if the newer tx processes.  At that point, the old tx will be invalid.
I'm not an expert.  This is just my current understanding of this issue.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Ellen Pao was an overpaid hack at Kleiner Perkins, tone-deaf to the more subtle, cultural currents that build relationships between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.  More so, she's completely oblivious to the culture/community that is Reddit.

From &gt; "I don't think the analogy is exactly right, but it's close enough."
Agreed.  Even if Bitcoin takes 23 years to catch on, (as did the net from say '72 to '95), then we are doing *Just Fine!*
If the analogy holds, just another 17 years before the beginning of mass adoption.  It may well be faster than that, but I also believe Bitcoin will encounter some enormous push back from totalitarian-leaning states, the US included.

They're paying what the best accountants and lawyers have recommended they pay, based on their creative use of loopholes, IP leasing, off-shore accounts, etc.
If the IRS cared to change anything, they'd petition congress to have such loopholes closed.
It's unlikely they'd do that however, since it's congress (and their benefactors) that created such loopholes in the first place.
And when congress hasn't created such loopholes, the IRS and SEC have done so on their own, e.g. [swap funds](

Any selling of goods, merchandise, services, etc. over the net use to be disallowed.  The net was considered something for research or  military communication back then.

This ban was lifted around '91 or '95.  Can't recall.  You'd have to ask an expert for exact timing, as most online info about this is inaccurate.

*LOL!*  :) I grew up as a child haggling at bazaars so I'm all too familiar with the word.
Unfortunately, the word "bazaar" is not *commonly* used in most of the Western world.  Certainly, one doesn't hear folks say, "I'm going down to the bazaar to get some groceries".  It's used much more throughout Asia and the Middle-East by English speakers, where it appropriately describes the marketplace.
The word also carries with it several connotations, many of which are not positive.  Among those connotations, one of the unfortunate ones, is its phonetic similarity to the word bizarre though.
Lastly, bazaars are almost always 'open' (both in terms of what is available for sale and in terms of the physical space).  Calling something an OpenBazaar is largely redundant.

If you're referring to overall portfolio diversification, then—depending on your risk tolerance—a relatively small amount should be invested in longer-term, higher-risk assets (for the normal investor).  Within that category, a relatively small proportion might be devoted to extreme high-risk holdings—which is where bitcoin would fit in.
The pluses for Bitcoin are a mile long, and so are the negatives.  Once you have had a chance to understand what it's all about, you'll know where you stand on it.
I'm incredibly optimistic about it, which means I have about 7.5% of my holdings in BTC.  (I don't recommend this for 95%+ of other people.) But I can afford to be invested in it for 10-20 years without touching it, I'm extremely risk-tolerant, feel very comfortable with the protocol in general, and have an envious track-record over 35 years.  With all that, 7.5% is probably still a bit too high for me.  If I were a little more responsible, I'd probably reduce exposure to 6.75%.

Not Tim's best post.
He begins by a laughably simple premise, that there's multiple blockchains.  Of course, there are.  I don't know anyone who disputes this.  To do so, would be to dispute the existence of altcoins.
However, when referring to ***the*** blockchain, it's an unambiguous term to those with any familiarity with the crypto-currency space.
If he's unaware of that, I'm not sure what to tell him.  If he's aware of that, yet still published his blog post knowing so, then I find his post to be somewhat disingenuous.

SHA-256 is at the heart of the protocol, protecting the stored value of bitcoin.
RIPEMD-160 and the secp256k1 curve provide transactional support and are both replaceable within the protocol via a fork without loss of BTC value.


So far.  We'll know as soon as it's compromised.  It will destroy the protocol.  Furthermore, there's a multi-billion dollar incentive for anyone who can hack it.  Thankfully this remains very unlikely.
SHA-256 is more than adequately protected against a brute force attack, even a quantum brute force attack is likely to be impossible.  See [Schneier's comment](  But there's always the possibility that an entirely new methodology is imagined that breaks everything.
However, RIPEMD-160 and Bitcoin's elliptic curve are susceptible to a quantum attack, and we may see this in our lifetime.  I expect we'll have prior knowledge to this, as many security protocols will be vulnerable.


Yep.  That's called a withholding attack.  Happens occasionally.  Not a big deal, but it would nice if we can come up with a solution for it.


Sure.  There's a ton of vulnerabilities.  See Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer's [work on the subject](  Since their report, there's been further analysis (I think by the same team) that illustrated certain attacks can occur with as little as 20% of the available hashing rate.
That's the short of it.  It may sound bad, but it's plenty secure for me to substantially invest in it.

The Fed was specifically set up by Congress to *NOT* be a part of the US government.  I'm sorry if they misled you in school.  It's not common knowledge and the Fed would rather people believe they are part of the government, hence their very authoritative name.
* The Fed issues shares of ownership and is wholly owned by its member banks.  The public is not able to invest.
* It pays an APR of 6% guaranteed return to its member banks, which include most of the large banks you're familiar with.
* The Fed is not inspected or governed by any arm of government.  It's accountable to no one, and has repeatedly refused to allow itself to be audited by congressmen and the occasional president (Jimmy Carter was the last president to attempt it.)
* The full extent to which the Fed is governed by law was passed by Congress (I think in the 1930s) which limited the Fed's mandate from exercising a fiscal policy purely bent on preserving value, to one that also included the support and creation of jobs.  The President can only "recommend" a nomination for a seat on the Fed's board of Directors.  It's their choice whether to fulfil it.  The only other main requirement is that the Fed Chairman give a status report to Congress quarterly.
* The "US dollar" and the "Federal Reserve Note" (which you use) coincided together from 1913 to 1971, at which point the US dollar (produced by Treasury) was ended.
* Since then, the US has had only the privately-controlled Federal Reserve Note.
This is a war that goes back to president Andrew Jackson, who made it his 2-term mission in office to end the control private banks had over the US monetary supply.  He was successful, until the banks regained control in 1913.

For Bitcoin, I feel the killer-app is better described as the killer-industry.  And there are at least a few industries that can pair incredibly well with Bitcoin.  In no particular order:
* Remittances
* Travel
* Secure storage of value
* Cannabis clubs  (they're having big problems with accumulations of cash)
* Adult services
* Micropayments (huge industry, think YouTube, Netflix, Pay-per-view sports)
* Crowd-funding (a new industry that I was pretty sure would fail, but has proved me very wrong)
If just one of these industries adopts Bitcoin as their de facto standard, that will be a sufficient foothold for Bitcoin to skyrocket from there.
And it may come from an unexpected corner, like the travel industry.  It's hard to tell.  Booking hotels/flights with bitcoin is pretty convenient, and being able to travel throughout your destination, simply using your cellphone to pay for things, without having to convert to local currency, is quite enticing to a tourist.  (Furthermore, merchants, in much of the world, will happily employ any payment method if they think they can make an extra buck off it.)
Ultimately however, Bitcoin has the potential to be the payment method of choice for the entire internet, which obviously represents the single most important market worldwide.

Additionally, if Bitcoin truly hits the mainstream, we may lose the ability to successfully pull off *any* future hard forks.  Bitcoin is already fairly heavy and unwieldy.  (Just think of of how long the IPv4 vs. v6 upgrade is taking, and that's a relatively backward *compatible-ish* upgrade.)
Core improvements at this stage need to begin being thought out for a long future, possibly in the 20 year range.  That's why we need as many dynamically-adjustable variables as possible.

@_date: 2015-07-29 05:22:45
Agreed.  All I did was read what you wrote and answered.  (The trolls here have an impressive ability at creative interpretation.)  
One thing that I certainly think is unethical and harmful to the American economy is the rate at which students loans are charged.  When I was young, they were ~3% max.  I'm told some grads are now paying upward of 11% which I find shocking.
Certainly, if the Fed can afford to lend to banks at 0.25% interest rate, congress (to the extent it has the minerals to take action) can mandate that the Fed provide student loans for 1.5 - 3%.
I began saving for my daughter's college education since shortly before she was born, so she didn't require any loans.  But if I had been unable to do so, and this were taking place today, I might very well be recommending to her a career and education outside of formal university.
In regard to your question of:


The nature of a student loan is treated differently than several other loan types.  Unlike a revolving credit default, as respected in most US states, a defaulted student loan will weigh with you for the rest of your life.  In most cases (in the US), large assets that can be attributed to your owning, such as cars or homes will be seized.
Some wealthy people have found ways around this, through the incorporation of various entities, and the clever use of off-shore accounts, but unless you have a very high-paid attorney and accountant in the know, this avenue is unavailable to most Americans.
The best approach to dealing with debt is to grow out of it.  By that, I mean do everything you can to make yourself as valuable as possible to your employer.  Continue to self-educate yourself and hone your skills.  Then continue to seek employment at the best paying firms, etc.  Don't be afraid to branch out into other fields, and take side jobs.  (Consulting on Bitcoin as one example or selling a service/product that people want.)  The internet has made this easier than ever to reach tonnes of customers.
Only if the above is ***truly not a possibility,*** then you'll need to consult with your loved-ones/family.  If they can provide financial cover, you may be able to eke out a very humble and mild existence, living in default.  Moving to another nation may help, but I don't know the ramifications of this.
All options are difficult in this situation.  The easiest option will likely be to repay.  And remember, if you can't repay the whole amount each month, always make your best effort and pay what you can.  (Judges take kindly to those who keep full accounting of their finances and can provably demonstrate they paid every cent they could afford to each and every month, even if that's only $2.  But they don't take kindly to ***missed*** monthly payments FWIW.)
@_date: 2015-07-29 10:10:47
Those are some strong claims, with very interesting repercussions.  
Can you please cite your sources?
I'm curios who took credit for the stress test.
I also sent four payments during the last test (not the mini one today), each with a $.01 miner fee.  They all confirmed within 2.5 hours.
If others were paying a similar $.01 fee, as I did, an accumulated total of $70k would suggest 7m txs happened in that time period.  (This is not even including the fact that you mentioned the $70k was "above the normal fee".)  But we know that only 1.51m txs happened over the 9 days of the last stress test.
Any clarification is appreciated.

For me, it's not about the price.  What 1 BTC is exchanging for, relative to other currencies is irrelevant.
However, as a security function, price has some bearing.  Lower price would support a decrease in mining difficulty, which would lead to a less secure network.  But since the difficulty level is orders of magnitude above that needed to secure the network, this presents no issue to me.
The technology itself has fascinating implications, regardless of exchange value.  The utility of this protocol, as a payment network, and a secure value storage, for the majority of the world's population is astounding.

Sorry to pop your bubble, but banks don't hate tether.  They're too busy doing things that matter to give a fuck about what tether is.  I dare say, most bank execs have never even heard of tether.
Secondly, pegged currencies aren't new (digital or otherwise).  They've been around forever.  A bunch of nations pegged their currency to the USD after WWII.  I don't need to "imagine" what this might be like, as you suggest I do, because I'm not a kid like you are.  I've lived through it.
The fact of the matter is that Tether was a great idea when Brock's friends and him first thought about it.  I wouldn't call it an earth-shattering idea, since many others had thrown around similar ideas.  But nonetheless, it was a great idea.  But since then, Tether has changed so much, it's practically unrecognisable from its original business plan.  About the only thing that remains the same is the word "tether".
Fast forward from 2012 to today and what you have is ***a complete and total scam!***
If you can't tell Tether is running a scam, then you should be careful.  Because there are a lot more subtle and sophisticated scams taking place everyday.

Since bitcoin can be converted to fiat nearly immediately, exposure to volatility rests with those who choose to keep their value in bitcoin.
As our liquidity pool grows, volatility will average out.  And as that happens, BTC value will likely increase in value, as more businesses chose to keep their BTC longer.
And regarding our liquidity pool:  let's not forget that Bitcoin's entire monetary supply is still smaller than the market cap of many a single US startup, e.g. Yelp's.
Bitcoin is infinitesimally small in contrast to its potential.  And if anyone questions its volatility, just have them review a chart of oil prices for the first 18 years it was on the market:  [chart](
Bitcoin is not even 5 years old, as measured from the first Bitcoin-to-fiat exchange of value.  [17 May 2010, UTC](

Sukrim, please.  I know you're sharp, so I have to interject here.  Bitcoin can replace, with ease, nearly all contributing account stores included in US definitions of M2 as well as parts of M3.  That you consider BTC to only be comparable to the physical coins and paper cash carried in one's pocket is surprising.
I can tell you must disagree then with Bitcoin's whole "Be your own bank" premise.  Because that would alone place bitcoin into most of the M2 index.

A lot of us simply appreciate the technology and the principles behind Bitcoin, and its possible repercussions.  My guess is that we're a relatively quiet segment.

Next time you ask whether something is legal, consider if this thought is applicable:
Free people ask whether something is right, whether it's good, whether it makes sense.
Then they check the body of related law to see if any of it is applicable.  Or whether the law itself is just in their regard.  If unjust, they take measures to get the law changed, or move to another jurisdiction.  Such actions are painful and time-consuming, opening one up to criticism, and on occasion, pushing one to the brink of financial insolvency.  Free people will trade their comforts, in exchange for a soul and a conscience that's at peace.
The first thing Sheep ask is whether an idea is legal.  If there's the slightest chance it's not legal, they banish the thought from their minds, never to consider it again.  Comfort, and fitting in, are at the top on their list, while letting their voice and their vote slowly slip away.  They consider it a necessary evil, endured to protect their comforts and to not cause waves.  They're too shallow to appreciate the greater good, too confused to realise the denial and "quiet desperation" they endure.  They drown it out with nighty rituals of TV, *infotainment,* drinks and a lay.  But they're never truly at peace.
Sheep are always right for the slaughter.  And Wallstreet, the central banks, and politicians, slaughter them on a daily basis.  Without them ever the wiser to it.

I haven't looked into this extensively, as it's a very deep and intricate rabbit hole I'm hesitant to enter.  But my gist is that now that US security settlements have supposedly been resolved by the SEC (2013), true "ownership" of stock is possible again.  Therefore any exchange, including a p2p based exchange should be as "valid" as any other exchange.  Integrating this into a blockchain should be easy (or into the Bitcoin blockchain through something akin to Factom).

Yep, just that little bleep for now.
What amazes me though, is that Bitcoin's *market cap* is already about 1/100th of India's entire M2 supply ($389b).
I know that ~1% of India's M2 may not seem like much, to most Redditors, but India is a huge nation (1.3b people) with everything that entails:
• enormous cities, with their share of skyscrapers
• substantial infrastructure, military and a diversity of industries
• a nuclear power, co-leading the thorium revolution
• strong educational institutions and a large tech industry, etc.
For Bitcoin to currently carry the value of ~1% of ***all that*** is astounding.  That it did so in only 5 years is stunning.

In perspective, Bitcoin's monetary supply is still microscopic by today's standards.
(Out of the millions of businesses worldwide, choose from just one nation, say the US.  From the US' hundreds of thousands of businesses, choose one modest-sized startup.  Say yelp.com.  Bitcoin's monetary supply is still less than the market cap of that one single startup.)
Today, bitcoin has 3 orders of magnitude of growth before even reaching 7% of global M2.

Constructive criticism:  the "Directory" menu is a bit *adverty,* for my tastes, but somewhat useful.  I discovered two new places nearby that accept bitcoin.

I can live with this, since it's a free app.  But if you publish a paid version of this, I'd like the ability to turn off this menu.
I also noted, a small bug which would be nice to get fixed.  I don't allow apps on my phone to auto-query for location.  When I go to the "Directory" menu, it gives me a "Location Warning".  Have it give that warning (3) times to users, then stop pestering them with it.  Just my 2 satoshi.

So far the bitcoin lending sites have left a cautionary impression with me.  I would need to see more accountable information from them as to exactly what their profit strategy is before I felt comfortable investing with them. I’d also like to see provable reserves and a co-investment by them in each of their approved ventures.  This would help align interests and I suspect lead to a better success rate.
In fairness, I've never tried one though.  I’ve only read their FAQs and once heard Andreas mention a not-so-great experience he had with one of the lending sites.
On a much wider, Bitcoin protocol level, lending in BTC might prove problematic.  One thing to be said for inflationary fiat, is that it’s great to be a net-debtor in.  Trying to pay back a loan, denominated in a deflationary currency, such as bitcoin, could turn out quite painful, depending on the exchange price gains in the interim.

In a sense Bitcoin is quite conservative, with similar qualities to gold.  It represents real money, and a real "store of value".  The fiat "experiment" that the world has undertaken these last 100 years, stores value at the expense of someone else's debt: usually your own.

That's exactly the issue.  I've never seen that claim made ever.  Yet buttcoiners, i.e. trolls, bring up that point and a number of other fully disingenuous arguments regularly, without the mods doing a thing about it.

I think was referring to an actual "source".  Not something made up out of fairy-tale land.
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:53:29
OK, let's start from the beginning then:


Firstly, Bitcoin isn't anonymous.  Anyone looking to launder real dollar amounts or anyone truly concerned about privacy isn't going to use Bitcoin.  The blockchain is clear text; and why subject your transaction to the statistical reliability of a tumbler, when you can use a proven system instead:  the US dollar.
Established currencies have been exchanged privately since the beginning of time, which is why states like Luxembourg and Lichtenstein have an economy.  It's also why the Cayman Islands has only one high-school and over 1,400 banks.
People serious about their craft don't take chances with things like Bitcoin's "pseudonomous" offering.
Money can be wired to a private account just as easily as anything else.
Bitcoin is superior as a general currency for many reasons, but in this context it has nothing to do with a presupposed degree anonymity, and everything to do with its *non-reversability.*  
Which brings me to my second point.  This quality, which is typically limited to cash and some commodities (such as gold) is a critical function for a currency to be used in thousands of different types of transactions instantly.  It's trivial to add *reversability,* to a *non-reversable* currency, but nearly impossible to do the opposite.
This is more likely why these criminals would want to use bitcoin here.  Once payment is made, it can't be rescinded, even if their coins are traced to an exchange.  It's also why central banks, insurance companies and corporations will all be using some form of crypto-currency in the future.  Whether Bitcoin, FedCoin or what have you.

It's more a misnomer than an absolute, which my comment certainly didn't make clear.
The issue is that a piece of software, such as MS Windows, generates a certain dollar value in sales per year.  Depending on how willing one is to play fast and loose with the numbers, one can try to take the sales of that piece of software, apply Microsoft's P/E ratio to it, and roughly estimate a "market cap" for that specific piece of software.  Bitcoin, on the other hand is free to use, i.e. has no sales.  In a sense it has no *market* value, but is a mechanism by which one can store and transmit tremendous value.
The difference being that in the first scenario, it's like valuing the worth of a retail chain store or a bank.  In the second scenario, it's like valuing the worth of the *inventory* being held by a retail chain store, or the *deposits* of a bank.  They're not easily comparable.  The deposits of Bank A are not easily comparable to the market cap of retail chain store B.
I see what you're getting at by drawing the comparison and it's kind of a fun thought-experiment, but tough to gleam any real data out of.
You'd have to take the *free-ness* out of bitcoin to draw the comparison.  The question would then be how much would the Bitcoin client sell for, if it were closed-source, patented, without any of the current altcoins, and owned by a corporation with the means to defend it, legally and politically, and champion in its use via ads, etc?  Then you'd have to compare that to something like the market cap of MS Windows itself, excluding the rest of MS's products and their expected future earnings.
All said, Bitcoin wouldn't be worth much in that context, just as TCP/IP or SMTP wasn't worth anything upon its introduction (or even 6 years after its introduction, (to more closely compare it to Bitcoin)).  Regardless of how poorly Bitcoin may map to conventional valuation metrics, I have no doubt that Bitcoin's true value is immense.  Just hard to fairly put a number on it.

IMO, it means there's a lot of consolidated wealth, sitting around in big funds.  And not doing much to really spur the economy, except to make the stock market appear to be on a bull trend.
If the subject interests you, you can think of velocity as how fast money moves through an economy.
With high velocity, a dollar I might pay you for something, you would quickly turn around and pay someone else with it, they would then quickly do the same, ad infinitum.  Over the course of a year, there was only ever one dollar, but it was used many, many times.  If we were to take a snapshot of the economy in motion, we may, for example, only see that one dollar exists, at a moment in time, but it has fostered many transactions.  This acts to effectively grow the monetary supply, without actually growing it, if that makes sense.
Economists measure this by the inverse of what income you don't spend.  For example, if you earned $100 and spent $60 (keeping $40) then you would have kept 40% of your income.  Inverted, that's: 1 / 40% or "2.5", which would be considered the velocity of your personal income.
On a nationwide scale, this is typically calculated by GDP divided by MZM, M3 or M2, over a 1 year period.

In the Bitcoin world, things area changing at a remarkable speed, even compared to other tech fields.  We also have a lot of young, ambitious and idealistic entrepreneurs.  (This is by no means a criticism: this is how Silicon Valley was built.)  We have a ton of new ideas being explored, ventures succeeding, ventures failing (some spectacularly).  New partnerships made, others broken.  A huge number of scam coins and scam artists (e.g. Josh Garza, et al).  Incumbent industries at threat, in some case from kids in their 20s who've just learned JS.

The Australian gov't demonstrated prescience by not further regulating Bitcoin, but the open-ledger, while having a couple advantages, can also be used as a tyrannical tool the likes of which we've never seen.  I prefer to not give governments that possibility from the outset.  And I couldn't care less about receiving any sort of "pat on the back" from them.  They have no right to regulate something that is free, open and provably fair, despite whatever authority they, or any other government, believe they possess.
Your comment that they feel they don't need to regulate it further, **is** as if, I told you that I had considered your exercise of free speech to a friend, acceptable for the time being, barring certain restraints.  And that, for the time being, you and your friends, were allowed to continue exerting free speech unless I deemed it necessary to limit it sometime in the future.  You'd laugh at me, and likely claim, "What makes you think you have the right to govern my speech ever?"
Bitcoin: Nothing other than language:
A computer protocol, which is nothing other than an agreed upon set of language that two or more computers use to speak to each other, has no right to be governed by any middleman (government or other) who may try to step in and tell you or me, that we can or can't use it.  It's simply none of their business.

I believe it means the Fed has dumped as much money as it can into the economy.  It's landed in the typical venues of storage, i.e. the hands of the wealthy and their corporations, and it's not improving the economy because it's not trickling down into the hands of ordinary people who are much more apt to spend it right away.  I see slow velocity as a sign of money laying stagnant, invested in bonds, mutual funds, the stock market, etc.
Sure, one can argue that investing in the stock market indirectly spurs corporations to do more hiring, etc.  But I think that argument is tenuous at best, and clearly nothing creates velocity like directly tunneling the money to the very people who will spend it immediately—often just to get by.
This isn't to say I'm an advocate for social welfare programs.  I'm not.  But I'm also not an advocate of corporate welfare programs either (of which the government seems to have no issue at coddling greatly.)
IMHO, it's dangerous policy.  And it goes against one of the supposed reasons the Fed was set up as a separate, private entity, i.e. to ensure that politics wouldn't interfere with sound fiscal policy.

* Last I recall, global M2, as denominated in USD, was estimated at about $51.3t at end of 2014.  If Bitcoin were to successfully replace 10% of that "value" (technically it's representative value, but let's not get into that now), then each bitcoin (based on bitcoin's supply of ~13.7m at the end of 2014) would be worth about $374k in 2014 dollars.

Amazingly, this is true.  Nearly all the political wrangling that has screwed up the US Fed's policy attempts (they were set up to be as independent of Washington as possible) has come from the "need" for war.  WWI, WWII, Korea (a little), and even Vietnam (which finally forced the US off the gold standard) and Gulf wars I and II, all played their part in the US' debt load, but more importantly, the substantial modification to a sound fiscal policy.
Engaging in war, turns out to be highly corollary to problematic monetary policy.
On one hand, a Bitcoin world, might alleviate this.  On the other hand, if Bitcoin were the accepted norm of currency, and a war came along that was truly necessary to fight, then it may not be possible to do so.

Bitcoin works just fine at $2/BTC.  The few paid devs aren't paid so depending on the price of bitcoin.


2014 saw a steady decline in the exchange rate, during which substantial investment and numerous startups have entered the industry.  None of their business models is contingent up on the an increasing exchange rate against the dollar.
A certain minimum value of BTC is needed to secure the network.  We're already 10,000 times past that.  Beyond that, bitcoin's exchange rate is just that—an exchange rate.  The protocol functions fine regardless.

If Bitcoin were to successfully replace 10% of that "value" (technically it's representative value, but let's not get into that now), then each bitcoin (based on bitcoin's supply of ~13.7m at the end of 2014) would be worth ~$374k in 2014 dollars.  I don't know if that makes sense.  It's a bit technical to explain.
* This is simplifying some terms, but should give you a ballpark figure of its potential.  What's more fascinating, is Bitcoin's velocity, which has the potential to blow away any currency not crypto-based.  (That's a whole other discussion.)
* **TL;DR:** Bitcoin has the potential to be worth ~$374,000 per bitcoin in 2014 dollars, if it took over 10% of current currency as we know it.  (Or $3.74m/BTC if it replaced the entire M2 index—unlikely.)

Of course you do.  Do you not know what modding a discussion is?  Do you lack any and all powers of discrimination?  This is not a free-to-write-anything, 1st amendment issue.  Judgement calls—*personal* judgement calls—are made on a daily basis, by every mod.  And thank god.  When someone comes along, and makes a series of comments or posts that amount to "you're stupid" you ban them.  If on the other hand, they choose to add to the discussion by substantiating or proving why they think "you're stupid" then let their comments stay.  At that point they may be adding to the discussion, and may even be right.
What I hear from you is a complete unawareness and abdication of your responsibility as a mod.  If you sincerely cannot tell the difference between a troll post and truly constructive criticism, why are you a mod?

I've heard this too, but never accompanied by evidence.  I suspect it's unlikely for one reason.  There's a lot of inefficiency in the bitcoin market.  Measurably so, as [Kevin Zhou]( has made note of.  Any decent degree of collusion would firstly take advantage of those inefficiencies.

1.  I haven't heard people say that Bitcoin will end banks.  We still need banks to get loans from, even if that loan might be denominated in BTC.  And being "your own" bank, doesn't preclude institutionalized banks from operating.
2.  Why would Bitcoin end governments?  Will people no longer feel the need to organise and defend themselves because they may have adopted a new currency?
3.  This one really confuses me:  Bitcoin will end taxes?  Yea, good luck with that.  Anyone who's told you that lives in a fairy tale.
4.  Most peoples' homes are already mortgaged, and I doubt a bank would lend them a second mortgage if the stated reason was honestly disclosed "to buy more bitcoin".
So who exactly are these people saying all these crazy things?  Any credible news sources?
Or are these just the multitude of voices in your podunk head?

In regard to your website (as viewed by a laptop), just to the right of the field whereby you request the BTC change address, ("Where we'll send your change") include a button-icon of a camera, which upon clicking it, brings up a QR scanner via my computer's built-in camera.  (Makes it east to hold my phone to my computer to scan it in, since my primary hot-wallet is on my phone.  Much easier than typing or even copy&amp;pasting.)
Include an "About Us" page with pics, and a "Contact Us" page with details including physical location.  (Try to **not** be based in New York.)


Not sure, but possibly blockchain-based provable reserves whereby any one user can lookup their 'balance'.  (I understand this may not apply here.)

If anyone, ever, is "panicking" over a BTC investment, they shouldn't be playing the field.  Bitcoin's volatility is not a secret.  In fact, it's about the only thing one can count on.
@_date: 2015-04-15 06:46:44
Full privacy at the core level will likely spell whether Bitcoin succeeds in serving the world freely, or whether it's badgered, handicapped and ultimately neutered by various government regulations.  I say this as someone generally in favor of regulation—when it's done correctly.  But regulating something like Bitcoin is as absurd as regulating free-speech in a private conversation.
We've already seen how bad just New York's proposed regs will be to Bitcoin—to the point that launching a Bitcoin startup from there is untenable.
Without inherent, proven privacy, there's too many ways for governments to attack it.  The first attack will be against its fungibility.  Privacy, implemented in advance, cures that.
And if privacy is not implemented before regulations around the world start kicking in, it will be impossible to "add it on" later.

Wow!  I thought my comment was long.  I guess you are serious.  I'm not sure I'll have time to address all your concerns/thoughts, but I'll give you my best, quick response.


Partially true.  But your blockchain transaction cites your IP address, and we all know that hasn't slowed down law enforcement in apprehending actual people.  Sure you could go through Tor, but the average person doesn't use that, and even that is potentially leaky.  Furthermore, sending BTC around to different addresses is somewhat useless, unless you can actually spend or exchange that BTC.  Sure, you could hold it for a long time, but that just postpones the process.  In most spending situations, you either buy something online, (in which case a mailing address is frequently required) or you buy something in-person.  In either scenario, your identity can be compromised.  (By the way, According to Snowden, nothing online is 100% safe.  And considering he had PrivAc clearance at the NSA, I take his word for it.)


I agree with the first part of that statement, but would cross out: "...so long as you're physically exchanging paper bills with a party whose identity you don't know."  Nearly all the world's wealth is represented in digital fiat.  And nearly all laundering is done via network transactions (digital of course).  At this stage, conversion to paper is unnecessary, and only raises red flags.  The USD serves as a proven mechanism for laundering.  No one knows how much USD is laundered each year, but when the US claims that just Luxembourg launders/ed $200b/yr, then I'd guess the worldwide total is at least $1t/yr.




Taking the time to write a primer on laundering isn't something I'd do online, and way beyond the scope of a reddit comment.  Furthermore, I'm sure there are much more sophisticated mechanisms in place today than the few older techniques I'm aware of.  The gist of your comment suggests you don't think laundering is possible or at least easy.  I'm not going to debate this with you, except to say it is possible and relatively easy.


Yes, non-counterfeited paper cash is truly non-reversible (per my comment above).  Like gold and several other things.  But not the 
**digital** transfer of "cash" **at its base state.**  When you send a SWIFT transfer (I don't want to get into the technicals here, except to say SWIFT is essentially a messaging system, not a payment system—contrary to popular belief) the network is essentially sending (and replying to) a series of verifications, as well as structuring insurance into the transfer.  That's why you can send a chunk of money say $100k in a few days at reasonable cost, but to do so in under 12 hours, will cost an arm and leg.  The primary cost of the transfer is the augmented insurance to account for a fundamentally weak security architecture.  Not to mention, every bank involved (and a typical international transfer has a minimum of four) wants their slice of the pie.  (Bitcoin is vastly superior to this current approach.)


At the **base level** of fiat, we haven't so much "added" reversibility to digital fiat, as it's proven to be fundamentally too difficult to do so.  It's more like we've accepted it, and found work-arounds that usually resolve in a reasonable transfer time, while affording degrees of insurance to protect the transaction.  This happens behind the scenes, at the bank-to-bank, bank-to-clearing house and central bank-to-bank levels.  And at this fundamental stage, reversibility is a hindrance to the exchange process, and measures are taken to eliminate reversibility.
When we move up a couple levels to the type of money we, as consumers use, then reversibility is most certainly added, and it plays a very valuable role for us.  I think we all like the fact that we can reverse a false charge on our credit cards, as an example.
By the way, I don't mean to sound opaque about some of this.  Your questions are big questions, so I'm trying to answer as concisely as I can without simplifying too much.
Anyway, the above mentioned consumer fiat, which most commonly appears as that in the M2 monetary index or "purchasing power", via credit cards, etc. is mostly reversible—but at this level, it's a good thing.  This is getting integrated into Bitcoin, and surprisingly many of the solutions do not require a third-party intermediary, as you alluded to.


Bitcoin isn't superior because it "facilitates an illegal transaction."  It's simply superior.  And because it is superior, it facilitates all kinds of transactions better, legal and illegal.  It's like the fact that TCP/IP is clearly better than say, the old Minitel network.  Because TCP/IP is superior, all kinds of information exchange is possible (text, 256k-colour, pictures, vidoes), whether they are legal and illegal.  The same analogy holds true for a sports car.  It's like saying a sports car is better because it facilitates breaking the law.  No.  A sports car just accelerates, brakes and hugs the road better, therefore it's better for all kinds of things that require that.  Mostly having fun.  But of course you could use a sports car for illegal things as well.  As with any good tool.  And Bitcoin is nothing other than a good tool, with all the good and bad that entails.


Non-reversibility is one of the cherished gems of a good currency.  I hope I touched on this above.  It's rarely better at the consumer level.  But it's critical at the inter-bank, inter-business and Fed exchange level.  It's a key component of a powerful currency.  And by Bitcoin's architecture, it has it natively. Consumer facing charge back services are of course also needed, regardless of currency.  And from what I hear, they're being developed for Bitcoin as well.

Furthermore, Ripple is a US corporation which has zero jurisdiction in Slovenia or the UK.  If BitStamp didn't want to process the Tx, they should have just refunded it back to Jed (or whoever it/they is/are).
@_date: 2015-04-10 20:54:03
You were right.  I looked up the last five transfers I did through CB and the number of normal (non-business) days taken to process each exchange was:
6, 6, 7, 7, 6.
What threw me off was that two of my purchases, made previously, still show "pending" status.  Not sure why; perhaps a cashflow deficiency in my banking account at or near the pull request time.  I suspect it was one of those 'pending' transactions that I had looked at 12-14 days after initially placing it, that made me think "Coinbase takes forever."
Sorry for claiming CB was *that* slow, when the evidence shows it's not.  (4-5 business days is still a bit on the slow side though!  :p )

...is microscopic in comparison the the US over-the-counter market.  Most investors are barely aware of it.  Last I heard the US OTC market was estimated at $795t.  So the entire Bitcoin supply is 0.0003% of that.


Apparently not.  Otherwise daily discrepancies wouldn't continue.  As far as exchange inefficiency goes, it's free to sideline cash on Coinbase exchange, and I'm sure anyone who cared enough could look into how to do so on the other exchanges, leaving only settlement, which could be done once per month or year.
The more I think about it, and from reading your and others comments about it, I'm confirmed in my suspicion that the Bitcoin market remains relatively immature/inefficient.

That's not the way to do it.  If it were me, I'd require users to pay in bitcoin to an HDW address set, held by my corporation or LLC.  Then (if I was a permanent US resident) I'd set up an individual account at Coinbase (or other) and receive bitcoin to that address.  From there I'd cash it out to my banks (using several) when needed.

But when did RL consider the selling of XRPs to be "sabotage" to its brand?
Not to mention it was only $1m, which they had Bitstamp (practically a subsidiary of theirs) freeze under threat.
And regardless of what agreement RL had with Jed, that agreement is non-binding for XRPs previously endowed to family.
Lastly, If RL didn't figure it out, their actions caused substantially more brand damage than selling $1m could have, not to mention calling into question fungibility issues.

Out of all the nations to be headquartered in, a network such as what Ripple's built, would have been better set up in another nation.
I don't think they spent much time shopping for jurisdiction before launching, which is sort of a mistake, if your goal is to build an international network while also trying adhere to the full regulatory compliance of one specific state in that network.

This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, just with this sub.  Personally I've heard some great jokes from buttrolls that I've loved, I've laughed over, I've cringed over, and I've upvoted them over.  That's not the issue.  We love it when they do that.  (I speak for the rest of us because I've seen known trolls receive significant upvotes here for just such humor.)
The issue is when they come along and state something to the effect of "you're stupid", "you're an idiot" or "it's a ponzi", without doing anything to substantiate their claims.  Hey if I am stupid, bring it on, with your insights, arguments and reasons.  If you think Bitcoin is a ponzi, fine.  Tell us why.

Thoughts to consider:
• These particular XRPs (now frozen) didn't belong to Jed, but were given by Jed to his family, prior to his agreement with RL.  Agreement not binding of others' possessions, just his own, which remain substantially greater than the $1m in this transaction.
• RL is a US corporation.  Any compliance by BitStamp is voluntary.
• one of RL's founders is on Bitstamp's board.
• BitStamps chief counsel and COO is also the chief counsel of RL.
• Why didn't BitStamp simply refuse the transaction and/or send back the XRP?  Why convert it to cash (via a RL agent) and then freeze it?
@_date: 2015-04-16 09:52:41

For those on the mainland, holding BTC means they can export it at anytime to a foreign exchange.  This can be difficult to do otherwise.

Personally, I'd like to see the core code built out better, before mass adoption takes place.
I have no doubt Bitcoin will hit at an enormous scale, touching every nation on the planet.  But before it does, I want it to be more robust, with a mature ecosystem.  (For example, Bitcoin supporting only up to 3.4 transactions per second is a joke in terms of mass adoption.)
It's easy to forget we're still in beta, and a lot of newbies still have a tough time figuring out their wallets, and being responsible for their own security.
Once these issues are resolved (mostly by code development and good UI), lets open the floodgates.  Doing so beforehand can lead to serious network problems and disfavourable branding.

The Federal Reserve, along with several other government agencies, frequently have private industry draft their press releases.  In some cases, it highlights the revolving-door relationship between government and private industry, that can be disconcerting.  In other cases, such as the Fed's, it's less of an issue, since the Fed is owned by its member banks.  There's nothing to prevent the member banks from agreeing to the terms of a release beforehand, and then having the Fed release those terms in an official capacity.  Remember the Fed is not owned by you, the taxpayers or any branch of government, nor is it accountable to them.  (Several congressmen, over the years, have tried to audit the Fed, and they've all failed.)  The Fed is simply there to serve the needs of its member banks.
It's pretty much a locked-in system, rife with collusion and corruption.  If it bothers you, solution: Bitcoin.

It's always a matter of degree.
Another thought suggests to me lack of collusion.  I have a feeling the bitcoin market is relatively unsophisticated.  There's typically daily arbitrage opportunities in the 1.5-2.5% range, that remain unexploited.  A mature market wouldn't allow that, i.e. at least someone would figure out a way to capitalise on it.

You got to love the Fed.  Andrew Jackson spent his two terms in office fighting the bankers, wrestling  control of US currency away from the private banks and back into the hands of Treasury.

I find it best just to relay what the numbers suggest.  Naysayers will always exclaim disbelief, one way or the other.
Having said that, it's actually pretty tough to compare the monetary supplies of Bitcoin to fiat.
For the most part, the fact that fiat is a debt, versus Bitcoin, an asset, doesn't raise problems.  But when you get into the nitty-gritty of comparing monetary supplies, it gets tricky.  And the answers are hardly clear-cut.
Furthermore, Bitcoin has been, and is expected to continue to act, like a deflationary currency—despite its regular increases to its monetary supply.  This raises issues as to Bitcoin's effectiveness to be successfully lent—possibly excluding it from certain M2 functions.  It also suggests that a greater amount of bitcoin will be simply held aside, instead of being reinvested in the economy, as fiat is.  This is likely to raise Bitcoin's exchange rate.
As mentioned briefly in my above comment here, Bitcoin's velocity is in another league compared to fiat, even digital fiat.  The effect of this is to undervalue the monetary supply of the faster currency.  That is, if one could accurately monetize its velocity value in fiat terms, Bitcoin would be worth substantially more than it currently is, as defined by its current monetary supply.  This also means that Bitcoin can provide for the same volume of transactions, while accommodating a lower M2 dollar amount.  Apologies if this comes off as counter-intuitive.  I'll try to make a better hard-ceiling estimate when I have time to look up some data.
**TL;DR:**  In general, I suspect Bitcoin will do great, barring heavy-handed regulation.

@_date: 2015-04-08 08:16:11
It's a good question.  I heard the phrase tossed about a few times until I first saw it for myself, and thought "Wow, this actually does happen!"
Concern trolling is like when newspapers headline with a question.  As you probably know, this is an age-old technique used by every tabloid to avoid litigation.  "Is John Travolta gay?"  "Did Streisand end up in hospital due to ex-boyfriend's drinking?"  They won't come out and make a claim because they have no legal foundation on which to do so, e.g. exposing them to a possible slander suit.  So instead of making any outright statement, which may or may not be able to be fact-checked, they just pose a question.  And while this most likely means nothing to you and me, it sends a few million, little old, blue-haired ladies into a flurry.  (Respectable papers will rarely headline questions unless it's absolutely sincere.)
So as that might be an example of *"concern journalism"*, a "concern post" seen here on this sub, might be something like: "Which account holders are to gain the most, if in fact Bitcoin is just a massive Ponzi scheme?"  This would strike me as possibly a troll post because:
1.  While sounding innocent enough, the author is assuming a suspiciously negative tone towards something he doesn't seem to know much about.
2.  The question is hardly a question.  Those who are to gain are simply those with the largest BTC addresses.  Simple answer.  Satoshi at 1m BTC, followed by numerous other users with lesser BTC amounts who, almost universally, are impossible to link to an identity.
3. The question presupposes that the issue of whether Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme was prepensed in question.
4. The question of whether Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme has not been in question by any credible critics.  Bitcoin is many things to many people, and has significant hurdles to overcome, some of which I'm unsure it will ever be able to do, but being a Ponzi scheme isn't one of them.
And of course, concern posts don't need to be questions.  There's a lot of ways to mix it up.  The short of it is, you'll know it when you see it.

Private currencies in the US have been the norm for most of the state's existence.  The first federated currency supported by the 13 original states failed miserably after a few years.
From about 1835 to 1913, the US had a generally successful public currency (Civil war not withstanding).  It was again privatised in 1913 with the creation of their Federal Reserve.
On a very small scale, alternative private currencies still remain in many states, as well as the right of their Treasury Department to issue federal public currency.
California was one of the few states (until last year) to outlaw the use of any currency that was not supported by the federal government.  Since that law was repealed, the use of bitcoin—as a currency—is no longer illegal there.

Good question.  As much as Bitcoin's exchange rate may be meaningless (besides securing the network), it certainly promotes a lot of hype among investors.

BTC-e is the biggest exchange (that takes Euro), and they've been ahead of the curve during this whole past year's price drop.

What are you talking about?  Forking, consensus and immutability are all separate things.  If the protocol couldn't fork, it wouldn't be able to drop the shorter chain.  It's by the very fact that it can fork, compare lengths and validate the longer chain that consensus can be re-established.  All of this was in place since day 1, and it's why it works so well.
Sure, we (as the community) would like to avoid deep forks, especially those that split down the middle of nodes, like in 2013.   But even that fork resolved itself—via the protocol's own design—about 20-something blocks later.
It's this very ability to split and continually re-mend that imho gives bitcoin its strength.  So I don't know what you mean when you say the protocol wasn't designed for that.  It's how it was coded up from the getgo.

Legality is determined in the courts. Not because you or someone else says so.

Ripple had the potential to be sort of a cool sidechain of Bitcoin, with some special qualities.
It was highly innovative back in '04-'06, and would be significant today, if Bitcoin hadn't come along.  Around the time they re-wrote their code, things changed with them.  Instead of trying to figure out how to fit in with Bitcoin (a clearly superior protocol) they forged ahead, pursuing their own blockchain knock-off.
Today they have a payment network, lacking popular demand, that doesn't truly provide irreversibility, isn't fully open-sourced (at least last time I checked, which was when they claimed it finally was—but wasn't), requiring “trusted” gateways and some sort of accreditation/rating system, hosting a near-worthless pre-mined token.
It’s hard to figure how they ended up in such bad shape.

Certainly worth considering.
In a sense, Bitcoin's payment system inherently leans this way.  It's attractive for merchants to offer a single public address for receiving payments.  This address can be mass-displayed (at websites, registers, etc.) and confirmed through third-parties that it is the correct public address for that business.

That doesn't take into consideration that XRPs are still a pre-mine.  Which means, the BoD could choose to transfer the remaining 68b XRPs into the possession (however temporary) of one of their executives, a subsidiary, Ripple Labs, etc.  Therefore bringing the coins "to market" and moving all 100b XRPs into the "in circulation" category.
Ripple's got a lot of great people working for them.  But their ever-changing business strategy sucks.  We need their personnel to come out from a failing venture and join the rest of us.

I have this same suspicion, not to mention that the CPI has been fiddled and tweaked so often, how does one truly compare back 30, 60, 90 years ago?
I'll say this from experience:  when I was a child, a typical blue-collar worker, earned enough to buy a home and car, have his spouse stay at home, take a short vacation every year or two, save for retirement (for two), raise a couple children, and send about one (on average) to college.  
This was true of mailmen, bakers, most retail salesmen, delivery guys, etc.
Those who were a little better off—engineers, managers, professors, regional sales distributors—might own an additional home at which they'd take a few months off each year to "summer".
I don't see this today.  Even among some very talented engineers and mid-level managers.

Yes banks are middlemen, but they themselves have to hire additional middlemen for all sorts of things, including transfers and various forms of insurance.  For example, if a bank wants to send funds to a foreign bank, typically a minimum of two intermediary clearing houses is required to do so.  Specialized insurance is also required to cover said transfers.
Ripple is currently trying to solve these issues for banks and hopes to become *their* middlemen.  Of course, it would all be a lot easier if they just switched to something that's inherently more secure: Bitcoin!

Amused, until the pitch for UltraCoin.
For whatever reason (likely network effect) value is being concentrated in bitcoin.  The remaining altcoins may be good for a number of great and amazing functions, but as a value store, they fall far short of bitcoin (including XRPs and Ripple's questionable accounting practices).
Instead of developing one more altcoin to join the masses, why not apply the work you've done on UltraCoin to the Bitcoin world?  Your post states that UltraCoin is based on Bitcoin.  If so, then why not simply allow for your trading platform to use bitcoins directly?

Fair enough; he wasn't being tortured.  But having been extorted by Carl Force out of $850k and then received a death threat from him, Ulbricht likely felt threatened for his life.

I've only caught them lying once (for a brief period), back when they were calculating their XRP *"market cap"* by taking the market price of XRPs and multiplying that by their entire base of XRPs (100b), disregarding the fact that most of those coins weren't actually in the public market.

Been in the space since the 8080 came out ('74).  The Bitcoin protocol is the single most identifiably disruptive social breakthrough I've seen.
Frankly, I never would have thought there would exist enough collective *trust* in the concept, to allow 1 BTC to reach parity with the USD.  That it has—and greatly surpassed that—boggles my mind.  This represents a social value, not technological.
Many years ago, Bill Atkinson (older programmer, remember MacPaint 1.0?) told me something interesting.  He said "100 years from now the invention of the computer will be a footnote to the popularisation of the internet.  What will be remembered was that the 1990s ushered in a new age of worldwide networking."
It's as clear as day to me, that what the net did to liberate the exchange of information, Bitcoin will do to liberate the exchange of value.

Agreed, the exchange rate is a second-order effect here.  However, second-order effects can "encourage bidders to bid less than they would have otherwise done" per above.


More than likely there will be several auction winners.  (If I recall they're being auctioned in 20 blocks.)


Frankly, no one has a clue what the winners will do.  For all we know, a winner might submit their bid for $255, just to immediately drop them on the market at $265.  It's tough to know what their agenda is.


I expect you're right.  But the fact is, none of us really know.  And if it were my office, I wouldn't take the risk.  It's not responsible, nor necessary in this case, nor defensible to most boards.  They, like me, would want a liquidation plan, mitigating risk, ensuring the highest return.

Many small businesses, (perhaps more of the *new hip ones*, even) are moving towards iPads as their processor.  I've had an iPad handed over for me to "sign" (with my finger) at restaurants, and I've been to several places where both the cashier and I (as the customer) had opposing iPads fixed in place at the front desk.  (Card readers attached obviously.)  Building on this platform seems substantially easier, if it represents a much smaller (but growing) use case scenario.
Additionally, things are moving just too fast in the bitcoin space to produce a stand alone device, and then add integration with existing cash registers down the line.  A fully integrated POS system is needed from the getgo.
If you were to get funding, consider from a business perspective, what there is to prevent the big POS manufacturers from taking your idea, integrating Bitcoin into their systems and marginalizing your potential sales.

Apologies.  I know it sounds harsh or unethical.  But is exactly right here.  The currency is not the value itself.  It's the token representing the value.  The value in this case had already been stolen.  In typical fiat, they can on occasion, slightly impair fungibility and get away with it, i.e. without compromising the integrity of the currency.  But this can only be done at a small scale.  In Bitcoin, everything is endlessly trackable, so breaking its fungibility does in fact scale, which could prove to be the end of Bitcoin, unless privacy measures are introduced.

Without giving this any thought or research, what first comes to mind is Changetip's statement that they'll be charging a 1% fee when users cash out.  Makes perfect sense.
Augment that with payment rails for off-chain micro-transactions, advertising services for charities and a little retail, and you have yourself a solid business.  If they get in trouble, they can default to user fees per tip: charge 0.1% per tip.  If I want to tip someone 50¢, I really don't care if Changetip charges me 1/20th of a cent to do so.  Sounds deceivingly small, until you remember volume * velocity.
Down the road, provide single-shop fundraising support and a payment mechanisms for crowd-funding and DOAs.  The sky's the limit.  Anything where you have a ton of little transactions that you want pre-processed off-block.

It frustrates me too.  And is the primary reason I've invested little in bitcoin to date.


Transactional privacy.  The day—if ever—that the Bitcoin core implements real privacy, (as ZeroCoin, Monero and Darkcoin are attempting to do) will be the day I invest significantly more in BTC.  Until then, the core devs are still abdicating their responsibilities to their political representatives.  Bitcoin has the potential to much bigger than any single government, and the core devs' responsibilities lie with its users, not any particular political jurisdiction.
At the core, Bitcoin is just a form of communication.  Innocuous and neutral in nature.  That "communication" should never be given to others to control, hinder, regulate.

It was an awesome system and clearly ahead of its time.  +1 on your comment BTW.  It faced two problems since.
* Satoshi's whitepaper came along.  It landed softly but carried enormous power and implications, of which we're just at the first tip of discovering.  This marginalised Ripplepay.
* Ripple's executive management has led their team astray, trying to build things that can simply be done through Bitcoin's blockchain.

When did Bitcoin become a business?
FWIW, all currencies simply represent a value.  And:


@_date: 2015-03-17 05:51:33
Not really.
Bitcoin is the most grassroots, bottom-up protocol I've seen, providing a means for anyone to pitch in and be apart of it, without corporate or political governance.
Ripple and its XRP, is a for-profit, centralised payment network, not "fully" open-sourced, functioning through a debt-based IOU coin to which Ripple pre-mined all units.
The two are about as different as can be.  Ripple wouldn't even have a seat at the table, if they hadn't burned their old code, and rebuilt it in 2011, borrowing extensively from the Bitcoin protocol. And consequently, marketing the *"crypto"* advantages of their business. 
Ripple's problem is that there's no substitute for good taste.  When they borrowed from Bitcoin, they took the more mundane principles of Satoshi's whitepaper and built off of that, leaving most of the very best principles behind.
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:05:03
In theory: correct.  But if I remember correctly, in the US constitution, certain provisions were provided against "the tyranny of the majority."  Perhaps someone with a better knowledge of US con-law than I, can expound.

I think his point was, after you've paid back the first dollar, what would you use to pay back the additional dollar of interest?  Unless Treasury were to accept an alternate form of payment, you'd have to use another dollar to pay back the first, thereby perpetuating the debt.  It's simplified—certainly—but I'm not sure it's simplified to the extent that, Maloney is necessarily wrong about this.  Frankly, it's an aspect to the monetary supply I wish I understood better.

Yes, "effects" can be substituted for "affects" in many a sentence, changing its meaning.
ProQuestion:  in what specific context is "affect" used as a noun?
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:01:16
True.  But as a public agency of government, they also have a responsibility to employ a modicom of sound fiscal practice when it's now *supposed to be* "the public's" BTC they are selling.
No one knows if over the next 3 months the price will go up or down.  And no one knows if the current price represents a low or high.  But dropping $13.5m over a 6-hour time period can potentially drop the market price or encourage bidders to bid less than they would have otherwise done.
Spreading the sale out over a 3 month period, as an example, greatly reduces, if not eliminates, this undue absorption of risk.
This isn't advanced theory.  It's what any decent board of directors would do if they had to dump some company stock.

They're pretty similar.  Circle doesn't charge you the 1% fee, but you need to confirm at what price you're purchasing your BTC at, because their price isn't the same as Coinbase's.

The issue with that is, if everyone were to simply hoard, without building out the payment network, then BTC becomes no different than that of any other collectable, i.e. subject to the whims of the market and its mania, not unlike the tulips of 17th century Netherland.  Simply hodling bitcoin separates it from the *"inherent value"* of its payment utility.

But that assumes you have an alternate currency or something to make payment of the additional $100 in.  If there is no such additional currency remaining, per Maloney's example, how would you make payment?  I'm not an expert in this by a long shot, but that was my take on Maloney's argument.

Good question.  I'm not sure anyone's investigated which coins were Finney's.  But someone did come along a few months after his death and place one huge dump on the market.  You can look it up, but from memory, it was perhaps on the order of 30k coins.  It can be investigated though, since we can track some of the coins to Finney.  (He was the first one to trade with Satoshi.)  Would be a fun look to see if they truly were Finney's.

Don't have a source, but I know checks were taken with suspicion for about the first 100 years.  If I remember correctly, the cheque was a British creation circa 1870s.  When I was younger, they were still fairly in-fungible, up until about the early 1980s.  (Shop keepers would look over them carefully and consternately, often turning down a check from a bank they hadn't heard of, and certainly some banks, with good reputations, were preferred over other banks.)
The introduction of the Visa credit card (1958) was met with such incredulity, people gave it little attention.  It was as if a stranger told you he had just built a transporter device.  You wouldn't give it much attention.  Sound investors of the age stayed away from it.  Visa's business plan was considered untenable.  Visa was actually more *revolutionary* then, than Bitcoin is today.  Source: family.

Let me rephrase, since I'm sure you're aware English isn't my strong suit.
You wrote: "Ripple predates bitcoin by a number of years."
I clarified: "Ripple the business [predates Bitcoin by a...], not the XRP,... [which obviously does not predate bitcoin]"
Frankly, I don't know why you'd then state: "Ripple dates from 2004, though XRP specifically only dates to around 2011."

You just cited a great catalog of people writing about Bitcoin who don't understand Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-21 20:42:22


No.  When you "suspect", you inquire.  And consider the claimant's reasoning openly.  If you have evidence to the contrary, then you may elect to not accept it.  Barring any evidence, accept the claimant's word at a face value, and file the necessary paperwork, per your jurisdiction.  BTC-e apparently is not required to file such paperwork, so be it.
Fungibility is a critical issue for any currency to survive, and it's not to be taken lightly.  Remember, it's not the US Dollar, the Euro or the private key of a Bitcoin address that's valuable.  It's the value that currency or key represents.  In a court of law, that's only ever what a successful plaintiff is awarded.
Lastly, BTC-e is not in the law enforcement business.  Why should it be their responsibility to become so?  If Bulgaria finds that there's sufficient concern to regulate their exchange, then I'm sure they'll take the appropriate measures.

The period of time when "credit cards" were greeted with suspicion and consternation was from the 1950s (Diners Club, Visa) to about the early 1970s.  Back then, Amex's card wasn't technically a credit card.  It was a charge card (more akin to today's "debit" cards).  It wasn't until many years later that Amex issued its first credit card. By the time Amex did that, yes, credit cards were in popular use, and readily accepted.

Very true.  Furthermore, 99% of people, simply put, are followers.  For whatever reason, they lack the capacity to evaluate something on its own merits.  Typically they look to someone, who they hope to pin their trust on, or make the best decisions on their behalf (hence, the "trusted" news anchor or a democratic "republic"). When that person succeeds, they bathe him in admiration.  When he fails, he's scorned or vilified.  The average person must use these tools and leverage them as best they can, as they have no other tools at their disposal.
To complicate the issue, the average-Joe, while truly a follower, finds it important to think of himself as *a leader.*
It's best to avoid the whole drama of others' strange and delusional states of mind.  Let them argue among themselves, while we build something new, empowering and fun.

You raise good points.  And I'm likely a little over-reactionary here based on my prejudices.  I'd say the charge of tax evasion is probably one that falls in to this category.  Depending on how I think about a fund structure, it may fundamentally be tax evasion.  If I think about it in different terms, it may not be tax evasion at all.  Plenty of persons have been charged with tax evasion, who were later acquitted, based on the evidence provided being unable prove it was evasion, particularly when alternate lines of thought are presented.  Just some thoughts.  But I take your point wells.

Primarily, I don't think of Bitcoin as an investment opportunity.  I think of it as an amazing payment network and currency.  That it may gain in relative value is great, but doesn't drive my use of it.
It's easy to use, especially for online shopping.  And I'm not a fan of serving my CC credentials to merchants.  It's also easy to use at the cafe I frequent.  Bitcoin has many interesting implications.  I'm not sure they're all good or bad.  But I'm in.  I think it's worth a try.

Yes.  For example, I'm quite content that my mortgage is denominated in an inflationary fiat.  (Over the last 20 years, it's gotten significantly easier to afford my fixed monthly payment.)
The same value proposition (for both bank and consumer) can be made in a deflationary currency.  It just requires the bank to estimate the deflation rate (as they already do for the inflation rate) and then assign the appropriate interest rate as a negative value.
For example, if Bitcoin were to fully catch-on, say 20 years from now, a bank might estimate bitcoin's 30-year annualised deflation rate at 5% and consequently, provide a consumer mortgage at a -1.5% interest rate.  Over time, your interest payment would get smaller and smaller, while the bank would maintain a ~3.5% annualised return on the loan.
Just a thought-experiment at this stage, but my point is that loans appear to be workable in BTC.

Everyone likes building from scratch, but at this stage of the game, we don't really need new services, as much as we need a substantial amount of help getting what we do have, just working correctly.
You would likely be a valuable addition to the core dev team.  Gavin's been saying for awhile that they have too many pull requests, and not enough people to properly test and evaluate them, which leaves them remaining not integrated.
I love the idea of building something new and fresh.  But if you could hold off a bit, until more of the fundamental architecture is in tact, (perhaps supporting that), then there will be plenty of time to build great and beautiful things.
We're at the very, very early stages here of Bitcoin, despite what the crazy folks on this forum think.  There's plenty of time.

Increased volatility is more of a reason to spread-out the sale, not less.  And "...getting the fuck out of bitcoin yesterday..." does not dampen the risk.  It only locks in whatever risk one is currently subject to.
As mentioned, no one knows if the price will increase or decrease, therefore most pros in this case will prepare a liquidation plan.  It may not be necessary for only $13.5m, but if I ran a government office, I certainly wouldn't take the chance in not doing so.

Keynesian economists are great for most things.  I mostly subscribe to Keynesian theory myself.  But monetary policy is one of their weaknesses, imho.
And don't believe anything an economist tells you, be them: Keynesian, Austrian, Chicago*-ian*, Neoclassical, Marxist, etc.  Consider their arguments, as well as that of the opposite, and come to your own conclusions, as to what makes the most sense to you.  This is pretty much true for everything.
Lastly, let's not forget that throughout human existence, cities and states were built upon hard currencies.  It's only been this last ~100 years, that we, as a people, have been experimenting with the notion of non-backed fiat currency.  And crypto is no different in this regard.
In another 100 years, I'm sure all currencies will be crypto-based, whether or not they're controlled by central banks, backed by anything, or provide for inflation.

Mosiac came out in '93.  It was hit among a selected group, but the average person had no idea what it was.  Navigator came out in Dec. '94 and people started to catch on.  Hotmail was the first publicly available free email provider to get any traction, and that didn't come on the scene until July, '96.  The public, at large, didn't really jump on board until late '90s.  And the social-media aspect of the net was generally a post-2000 development.

It's certainly an aspect of Bitcoin that needs much more discussion.  Frankly, I'm surprised regulators are so concerned over Bitcoin.  If they understood it, they should love it.

Depends on your objectives.  If you're just buying a little to play with, maybe spend some at your local cafe or for youtube/facebook tipping, then *personally* the price fluctuations are not important to me.
If you're thinking about investing in BTC, because you believe in its long-term potential, then this is a relatively good time to do so (imho).  Just be aware that it's highly volatile, only a small portion of your investments should be in BTC, and give it **many** years to mature.

And apparently Satoshi used all but 0.00% of Ripple's ideas.  Whereas, Ripple threw out their old network code, and completely re-built an entire new crypto-currency network based on a shared blockchain, after Satoshi's white paper gained traction.
Ryan Fugger regarding Ripplepay in 2005: "...the goal was to create a system of debt money without artificially imposed scarcity."
Don't get me wrong.  At the time, this was very interesting.  And I have all the respect in the world for Ryan Fugger.  But let's be realistic.  Satoshi's whitepaper blows all these ideas—the good, the bad and even the best—out of the water.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:30:25
True, but that's like saying Bitcoin ≠ the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-03-17 06:07:37
Ryan's original idea was awesome.  And Jed's 2011 implementation was smart in many ways.  Unfortunately, as they recruited and built their exec team, they did a not-so-great job.  I say not-so-great because their execs would excel at many another industry, just not this one, where it pays to have some engineering/crypto experience beforehand, as well as a cultural understanding of the space.
This has happened many times in the Bay Area.  It's nothing new and has been going back to Shockley in the mid 1950s and the treacherous eight.  There's a common dynamical mismatch between the execs and engineers.  In my opinion, the execs usually screw things up, which is what I'm seeing with Ripple, particularly since around 2011-2012.
Ripple, has it currently stands is a joke, imho.

What he did just isn't a criminal.  Perhaps according to some (ok, many) statutes of law, but he's not a criminal in any ethical/moral way.  And aren't our ethical/moral principles what criminal law should be based on?  I'm sure if I met him in person, he'd be about as harmful as a butterfly.
Furthermore, there's no apparent victim.  And as evoorhees mentions above, his website was voluntary.  No one made people use it.
I've never done drugs, barely ever drink, have never broken the law (that I know of), drive very safely on our roads, and am pretty much a goody two-shoes as a citizen.  Drive near me in traffic;  I will let you in.  And if my daughter came to me one day, and told me she was curious about drugs and wanted to try some, (knowing that it's impossible to stop the curiosities of youth) I'd probably want her to buy some whatever from some reputable Silk Road seller, with dosage, ingredients and purity levels correctly labelled, instead of from some back-alley dealer with who-knows-what mixed into it.
This war on drugs, (and we have it here too) is simply crazy.  Even the US' alcohol prohibition only last 13 years.  How long has this war on drugs gone on?  I think it was part of Nixon's re-election campaign if I remember right.  The damage it's caused is immense, even abroad.

It's amusing how clueless New Yorkers are to West Coast startups.  HP, Disney, Mattel, Apple, Maglite, Amazon, Google didn't start in garages because they preferred that unkept drafty feeling.  They launched where they could because they were broke.  And if $5k was required of them, much less $250k, we wouldn't have them today.
New Yorkers take a different approach.  They spin a division off of Citibank.  Call it a "startup."  Cut some closed-room deals, bring their political buddies on board, and think the world owes them a profit.
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:02:17
I just mention it because if you've done a lot of Bitcoin research, and you're looking to make some money, there's VC firms that I'm sure would like to get some harder data on Bitcoin.
They're getting a lot of bitcoin-related business plans lately, and I'm sure there will be plenty more on the way over the next few years.  The problem is, it's hard for them to know how big the potential market is, what the user-base currently is, how fast is it growing, and how *spendy* is the existing base.  All the normal demographics.
User-data in Bitcoin has typically been scant.  If you can fill that need, even if it requires partnering with a college buddy who may have more of a math background, that might be profitable.  Those types of reports aren't cheap, and I'm sure MasterCard and others would like to have their copies as well.  Actually now that I think about it, Citibank's already funded at least one such [study](  So at the very least you could try to get a grant from them.  It mainly depends if they need some answers in this area or not.

It's especially sad when the state enforces some new law, (which would have been considered completely absurd when I was a child) only to result in some unaware citizen being so ashamed that they mistakenly broke it, they blame themselves.
It's really quite amazing.
A well-known expression from my youth was: "There's no such thing as a victimless crime."  This didn't mean that there was always some victim—however unidentifiable.  It meant that a crime was simply not a crime, no matter what, if no one was hurt.  I doubt anyone even knows this expression today.
And it certainly hasn't stopped state prosecutors from levying a bevy of charges against individuals on a regular basis for 'victimless crimes' in this age.
The least one can do today, is to try to gain some semblance of actual control of their personal finances and privacy.  Enter Bitcoin.  (But I do wish Bitcoin had more privacy though.)

Are you sincere?  Take even a relatively young nation like the US, and just consider how many different currencies it's had in use and the vast changes made to them over the years.  There wasn't even a federally-backed bill until the end of Jackson's term.  And even that collapsed.
Even instruments such as the Visa credit card were mind-blowingly radical for their era (late '50s).  More so than bitcoin is today.  Back then, the idea that you could buy something without money, but with "credit," which was instantly granted no less, regardless of what you purchased (consumable or not) was shocking to people and incredibly innovative at that time.  And as usual, 99% of people thought the whole idea was absolutely and laughably rubbish.
Bitcoin is the cash for the digital era.

It's not the event that matters.  It's the information (or awareness) of the event that matters.  This is a pretty elementary aspect of *Investing 101*.

I don't share your optimism that fleeing is a viable option.  If he had close family abroad, and very much depending on the nation, it may present a slight chance of escape.  Other than that, if he were to attempt to flee, I think he'd discover exactly how small the world actually is, especially with the bounty on his head.

Ahh, no.  And that you stick so strongly to this belief without citing further evidence, suggests to me you'd be well served to give it a little more study.  Furthermore, your statement of:


does little to validate your claims, for two specific reasons.
Firstly, having settled on a block finding time prior to live network analysis, does not suggest the 10-minute time parameter was arbitrary.  Many of us make non-arbitrary decisions frequently, before testing.  We're able to do so from the body of experience we bring to the task, in addition to estimates performed in advance.
Secondly, you don't know that Satoshi "settled on it" before the network went live.  He could have easily coded it for 10-minute blocks, then brought the network live, to see how well it functioned.  Who's to say he didn't monitor the performance of the live network's 10-minute finding time, only to "settle on it" afterwards?  There's no evidence that any of this was arbitrary.  On the other hand, there remains, very much the suggestion it wasn't.
I’m not sure if you meant to post your second paragarph as written.  There are multiple, fatal flaws in your logic, demonstrating a pretty complete lack of knowledge on the subject.
Your third paragraph:


Right.  Are you aware that incentivisation structuring is a field of study in itself at the graduate level?  There’s quite a bit to it, beyond your topical and apparently elementary, appreciation of it.  There’s no need to speculate how high fees need to be.  They will be too low when miners drop out, and too high when consumers switch to another payment method.
It’s simplifications like these you’ve presented, which is why I can’t stand to read from authors like you.  You bring nothing new or interesting to the table, and exercise poor analysis.  You've demonstrated an unwillingness or inability, to study the subject before arriving at an opinion.  A pretty stupid opinion at that.

@_date: 2015-02-01 08:50:27
I'll typically bounce back and forth a bit between a log and linear when trying to get a sense of something.  The data is the same of course, but log scales give better context to older data, typically represented to the left of a chart.  To scale correctly, linear charts need to compress this.  The numbers are accurate either way, but the log scale typically brings out the severity of events as they were experienced at their time.  It's also easier to estimate a trend via a log scale, not that I recommend technical analysis—I wholeheartedly do not.
And not to forget, we live in a log world.  Everything increases or decreases in some form of exponential fashion.  So it sort of makes sense viewing things that way.  Anyway, it's all a matter of what works for you.
If you compare these two charts: [price in log]( v. [price in linear]( you might be able to get a better sense from the log chart of how severe the previous drops where.  Whereas the same data on linear chart mitigates those effects.  For example, when in mid-2011, the price reached $32 and then fell to $2.30 by Jan-2012, you can see it more clearly on the log chart.  (This was devastating to some early hodlers at the time.)  If you look at the same data points on the linear chart, the data is scaled down (to make room to show the later highs) and it mitigates the impact of that mid-to-late 2011 decline.  Linear charts typically compress the data the more you go back in time.
Hope that helps.

A jury's choice is theirs and theirs alone.  They are beholden **to no one** to answer **why** they make any decision they choose.  Any discussion of a case after verdict is theirs to make purely **voluntarily**.  And unless someone's called to the witness stand and testifies, and is *proven* to have intentionally lied to the court, perjury is difficult, if not impossible, to prosecute.  I'm a firm believer in a jury's power to not only decide guilt, but to decide whether the law as applicable to the defendant is indeed just.  Accurate, fair and specific Justice is simply too important.  Avoiding this level of humanity, is precisely how states become machines, and how courts lose their moral authority at exercising justice.

I guess I prefer the Japanese system of criminal justice, whereby if a defendant is not a physical threat to society, he will rarely be locked up.  (Granted his property will be seized, and he'll be fined to hell and back.)
Jail is a physical treatment that I believe should be used for the specific purpose of detaining those who are a physical threat.  It saddens me to see the US so strongly use it as punishment, and in so doing, lock so many of its kids up—at considerable expense—ruining the remainder of their lives.  Which it absolutely does, despite popular perceptions.

Who asks who to blindly trust something?  None of my tech friends have ever asked me to trust bitcoin.  In fact, quite the opposite.  To a one, they've all told me to look into it for myself.  And they couldn't care less whether I happened to be intrigued by it or not, much less if I've ever purchased any.  To them, it's an interesting technology, with a lot of promise, whether or not it succeeds as a currency.


The maths really isn't that complex.  Frankly, it looks worse than it is.  But isn't that how maths always is?  Remember learning the quadratic formula in secondary school?  It looked like an absolute mess.  Or Pythagorean's theorem before that?  I'm sure you'll admit, that once graduated, it really wasn't that bad.


As for the majority of Americans, yes, you may have a point there.  *Trying to understand* something isn't typically their greatest strength.


Again, who's asking who?  As it relates to religion, I've kindly asked some of my religious friends, a particular family member, and those who show up at my door, unannounced, to please cease their attempts at converting me to their ideology, to little end.  Which incidentally, is severely predicated on trusting something I cannot touch, see or hear.


Yes, we all like products and consumerism in general.  But rampant materialism is not, in itself, a solution to anything, except to that of an empty wardrobe.
Yes, a degree of trust is required in bitcoin, if for example, you were to purchase some.  But that is your own choice to do so.  The data is all publicly available for you to research.  And only to the extent that you choose to not educate yourself, is the extent to which you need to trust others for advice.  As a protocol and an entire ecosystem now, it is complex.  But you have the choice to have it be dramatically less so, depending upon your own actions.  And yes, some trust is needed in pursuit.  But bitcoin protocol is about the most *trust-less* concept I can think of.  Everything about it, is fundamentally based on NOT trusting others.
Instead of *you* suggesting I've advocated some position—which I haven't—and then secondarily, suggesting I stop doing so, why don't you simply follow your own advice and cease to suggest I change anything?

I'm looking forward to distributed Wi-Fi via phone as well, especially as you mention, for the developing world.  I'm kicking myself because I can't remember the name of a start-up that was looking into something similar to this about 4 years ago via the GSM network.  And I'm probably butchering their test results here (apologies in advance), but from what I remember, they found that an average smartphone connected to a GSM tower could be made to act as a hotspot providing voice/data to another smartphone, which could then in turn do so for another smartphone, etc. down the chain to 5 phones in total.  Essentially the 4 intermediary phones were acting as routers and nodes.
Part of the problem they knew they would face related to the GSM network.  But dropping GSM, going Wi-Fi instead and integrating BTC payment, it could be huge.  Particularly in poor, population-dense nations.

Ahh. Let me FTFY.  There's kind of a technical point here.
The Fed owns all "Federal Reserve Notes" simply because they own all Federal Reserve Notes, regardless of monetary supply.
You're not allowed to deface, mutilate or destroy a bill because it is not yours to do so.  (Oddly enough you are allowed to do this with US coins, because coins are made by the Treasury, not the Fed, and when you own one, you truly do own it.)  When you carry a bill in your pocket, you don't technically own that bill.  You own the value of which that bill represents.
Some have argued that since citizens own the "value" the bill represents, that then inflation should be made illegal, since inflation detracts from the value of a bill.  Unfortunately, this argument fell on deaf ears long ago.

Very different instruments.  One is a currency; the other a transaction lubricant, credit provider and insurance product.
While I can envision Credit Cards denominating their value in BTC someday, they do something that bitcoin in itself doesn't:  they lend credit.  They also provide a degree of consumer protection, in the form of slight arbitration via merchant charge-backs.  Something the Bitcoin protocol wisely does not support.
Down the road, I can certainly see the need for such consumer instruments built on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

That part you quote is untenable for the successful operation of a business.
No online business could deal with that, unless Ben's proposing something like a 90-minute turnaround window for approval.  Which of course, isn't long enough for them to review it, much less understand the implications.  I don't think the NYDFS knows how business is done under pressure.  It's a 24-hour cycle and most of us are never five feet from our cell-phones.
Interestingly, I believe this could open the door to substantially more fraud:  if his office does approve a change, and that change turns out to be malignant, his office will then be liable for having approved the decision.  If I were a regulator, I certainly wouldn't want that responsibility.
Lawsky's regs are simply a non-starter.  The NYDFS would be less disingenuous, if it simply proposed to ban bitcoin in NY.

Love the links you post, and this one was no exception.  But I'm left confused by your comment:


I still don't see how multiple private keys could control a single public address?  (Unless you mean the different versions of the same private key, such as those in Base58 or those still un-ammended after SHA256, but I would consider those the same key)  Would you mind clarifying, or pointing me in the right direction?  And thanks as always for your posts.

Every time I hear of a bitcoin remittance business, I'm a bit puzzled.
The blockchain is already global.  So all that's needed is one exchange in the first nation and another in the second nation.  I can receive someone's public address as a text or email, etc. and fund it directly myself via my phone or PC, etc.  All that's needed is a way for them to have the value usable in their local currency, i.e. an exchange.  If each exchange charged 1%, that seems much more cost effective.
Tell me what I'm missing here!

Absolutely.  Security really needs to move into the architecture level, whereby even the execs, the coders, even those with root access can't control the users' private keys, as one example.
I don't recall the name, but an American guy on the East Coast has been (or still is) trying to develop an ISP that by its very architecture is incapable of recording users' identities.  So when the NSA comes knocking, subpoena in hand, he can lawfully comply, while not giving up a single identity.
Seems to me, bitcoin would be good for this as a payment mechanism.

Yes, and according to the US Constitution, only Congress is supposed to control monetary policy.  But that's long since been thrown out the window.

Your number is off. It should be a bit higher without doing the math on it.  Regardless it's not a big deal, nor an "incredible" investment for that risk level.

Oops.  Sorry, I thought you were speaking in regard to private businesses, in which case an unwarranted audit can be disastrous, even if the proprietor has done his very best to maintain compliance.

Absolutely.  These revised regs are as clear a indication as one will ever get from a government office, that they couldn't care less about the concerns of the users.
No online business could deal with that, unless Ben's proposing something like a 90-minute turnaround window for approval. Which of course, isn't long enough for them to review it, much less understand the implications.
Interestingly, I believe this could open the door to substantially more fraud: if his office does approve a change, and that change turns out to be malignant, his office may then be liable for having approved the decision. If I were a regulator, I certainly wouldn't want that responsibility.
Lawsky's regs are simply a non-starter. The NYDFS would be less disingenuous, if it simply proposed to ban bitcoin in NY.

Right on!


Good question.  I'd have to run some simulations to make sure it was acting how I'd hope, but the idea is that someone (probably a business) could hold BTC in a relatively long-term position, while not experiencing the deepest lows or the highest of highs.  But maintain something of a 6-month trailing average, free to exit at anytime.  Basically buying themselves some risk-aversion.
If it's possible to put together a product like that (I'm not sure what position a counterparty would need to take to make it work) I could see some conservative individuals using it as well as *many* businesses.  In fact, if you get the maths worked out, it would likely be good to partner with BitPay or Coinbase, either of which would bring a lot of liquidity to your platform.  Maybe license them an API?  I don't know.
Right now, most Bitcoin merchants are immediately dumping their BTC for fiat, because they can't handle the risk.  But I'm sure that some of them would like to keep some earnings in BTC, if the risk can be managed.  I'm sure you guys will figure something out.  Best Wishes!

You're measuring value as denominated in $.  What's the value of the protocol as denominated in BTC?
If the protocol originally called for the distribution of 21b coins, (instead of 21m), and each coin was valued at 25¢ would that mean the network was any less valuable?
I agree with you in terms of relative market cap, but not so much in terms of a per unit $ value.

It's just because doing a code patch on the bitcoin core protocol is an engineer's nightmare.  (Andreas Antonopoulos described it as trying to do a firmware upgrade on the control system of a Boeing 747 in flight.)
Reason being:
1. It happens live.  You can't temporarily stop the bitcoin network, while you upgrade.
2.  Once you push an upgrade, there's no going back.
3.  If it's a bad upgrade, leaving part of the community running the old verison, and part running the new version, we could have an unintended split in the network.  This could raise many issues, if not resolved timely.  It could also lead to two Bitcoin networks.  (You Bitcoin experts out there, please chime in if I’m wrong here.)
4.  The Bitcoin network is currently supporting $3.2 billion of people’s value.
5.  The media would *love* this story.

If you're truly off-grid (i.e. not charged) with 24x7 power, then that's a plus.  You're going to want a fiber line with very low latency, and you'll still need to scale up to bring your costs/hash down.
It's one of those "Go Big or Go Home" dynamics.  And it really doesn't pay to set up a small to mid-sized operation.  Do the math.  It's pretty obvious.

You do realise that, apart from whatever they taught you in pre-calc, once you enter the working world, professionals use *logarithmic* and *exponential* interchangeably, since [a = b^c] = [log(sub b)^a = c].

In practice, it's degrees of trust.  And I cringe when I think of Satoshi's 'one CPU, one vote', because what he had in mind was way more decentralised than what's evolved.

No.  Maybe we're reading this totally differently.
I assumed he meant 'compromised' in the sense that e.g. victim Bob touches something, then attacker Alice comes along, lifts the print, scans it, and now has either a digital identification of it or can make a physical print of it.  That's the problem with biometrics.  We leave our fingerprints and DNS all over the place.  A retina can be scanned through certain nefariously-placed cameras.  And both the retina and the fingerprint may be able to be re-derived from a DNA sample—**assumedly**.
So if your passcode is your fingerprint and someone gets that print, I guess you could switch to another finger, but they may already have those prints as well.
Maybe I'm wrong.  That's what I took from how he was using the word 'compromised.'

The issue with Keynesian theory isn't that it's "wrong."  (Not to criticize.  I know you didn't say that.)  Many aspects of it have been demonstrated to work.  Just as many competing theories have good and bad aspects, and parts that are testable, while other parts will remain forever in theory.
It's mainly when it comes to *monetary theory*, that many (especially the Austrian economists) feel a Keynesian approach is lacking, myself included.
And you're absolutely right, in that folks on all sides get zealously religious defending whatever camp they're in.  Once they've locked in to their side, open-mindedness, curiosity and creativity go flying out the window.

Sure, but ECDSA is easily replaceable in the core protocol.  Plus Satoshi made an interesting and unusual curve choice.  And I have a suspicion, he had some reason in doing so.  Lastly, and I'm not an engineer, but if memory serves a 32-qubit attack should be sufficient to break ECDSA and we haven't seen that attack yet, even though quantum computers supposedly have a few hundred qubits now.  Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.

In fact, it's a great point you make.  And it's related to many an industry including currencies, and to an extent, even commodities.  (It's been estimated that only 14% of gold's value is from its useability for jewelry/electronics/etc.)
The concept runs into problems though with TA, in that, to gain a competitive advantage this way, one must try to forecast a strategy that the herd (for lack of a better word) won't be utilizing.  But since everyone is already trying to do this, it sufficiently diversifies the body of competitive TA strategies, thereby bringing it back to a point whereby any one strategy approximates random chance.
But like I said, don't take my word for it.  Just run a proposed strategy against the back-data.  If you find an exploitable glitch, you are in luck—big time.

8% is possible.  Remember Bitcoin is really better for merchants.  A lot of businesses function on a ~3% profit margin.  If they can convert 20% of their credit card sales to payment by BTC, and are currently paying 3.7% (e.g.) in credit card fees, that translates to a **~25% increase in profit** for one year, and that's just if they can convert 20% of CC sales to BTC sales.

I've often been amazed at how small tokens of appreciation from the merchant to the consumer can translate into sales.

Ripple is working to do this, but they've shifted strategies.  They're no longer targeting a retail customer base.  They want to integrate (possibly replace) SWIFT, ACH, EFT, etc.
Awhile back, I was doing little research about Swift.  Back in '73 Swift had the very clever idea of being an exchange, but not being an exchange.  One reason Swift is so successful, is that it basically performs a communication "messaging" service, which in turn can transfer value.  Old and clunky, but not unlike Bitcoin.

Yes.  ~~One of the~~, no, the primary problem facing the Fed (and all central banks) is that the monetary structure created is inherently not sustainable over a long period of time.  Granted it may fly for a couple hundred years.  But at its core, it's dependent upon continual debt creation and an increasing monetary supply.  (Marx would have argued this was true for all capitalism, but I really can't comment without further study.)
The Fed, while being a pretty darn independent entity, is subject to a congressional mandate to optimise its policy for job creation.  (To the extent they exercise this is debatable.)  I believe this *intention*, but the instituting of central banks has so many other problems at hand, that I, for one, would like to see a competing instrument.  Enter *Bitcoin.*

Thank you, but the arguments you presented are already compelling in themselves.  You guys are onto something very big here.  And I wish you all the best!  Thanks for being so responsive in your replies.  And I'll check out the markets section of your site.
I hope you choose a good VC firm.  They can work wonders to make your business a success, especially if you're fully upfront with them about the difficulties you're facing.  (One of my VC friends, retired now, once answered me, "I always know when a startup is failing because they stop calling me."  :)  If you're open with them to the troubles ahead (and there are always troubles), they'll respect you, but more importantly, they're good at problem-solving a variety of start-up issues.  Especially once their cash is on the line!
One last thought, once you get funded, please weigh the option of being headquartered outside the US.  (Even if your R&amp;D, employees, etc. remain state-side.)  As you scale, this will inevitably save you several long headaches.
Best Wishes!  I'll be watching, and definitely trying this out someday soon!

Selling a few things bitcoin related, such as some of [these]( [these]( or [these]( might bring a little attention to your store from those predisposed to buying in bitcoin.  Of course, once they're in the door, it will be up to you to convert those sales into additional ones.
(PS: this works quite well for my local corner store.  They price-match on milk and other basic necessities, and then make up for it in abundance on all the other things we end up buying while in there—which are certainly *not* price competitive.)

You have a good point there.
I know some places will let you pay x amount on one CC and the remainder on another.  Those places may let you do the same with BTC.  But you're right, they are the exception to the rule, where it's usually all or nothing per payment service.

For my area, the CPI is wholly irrelevant.  While official inflation figures have crept along at under 3% for the last 30 years, (I think the figure is closer to 2.4% per year average going back to '85), the average cost of homes, rents, vehicles and medical expenses has greatly outpaced that.
Making matters worse, household income, while it's outpaced the CPI, has greatly lacked relative to local property and medical costs.  It's caused a tremendous divide in our local economy.

As mentioend, open the time scale and switch to log to get a better understanding, just as Rism links to. From there you'll note that there certainly was a drop after The Goxxing (early 2014), but come April 2014, its rebound is more than the chart can reveal, since by then, a lot of outfits switched their internals to off-blockchain transactions.
So yes, it appears flat for the last 7 months, but it's fine.  And growing.  You just won't find accurate growth data now since so many exchanges and businesses are off-block now.
If you're concerned about bitcoin's adoption/use/volume rate, and want more accurate data, switch to other metrics.

We'll see if they can liquidate those, as well as the SR coins.  Agreed though, if all those coins fall on the market near the same time, there will be a massive price crash.  But it's ok.  Bitcoin's strength lies in the number and diversity of its users.  It will recover.

Yes, this is necessary for a healthy market.  And I know it sucked for a lot of folks, but these are normal growing pains for a new industry.  It's things like this that will lead to provable reserves and degrees of transparency.
Also, the EU and US, are so use to rigged and also heavily-regulated markets.  (I know one should exclude the other but they don't seem to ever do so imho.)  The Bitcoin network is still a largely free-market phenomenon, so for better or worse the rules of free markets apply—a new concept to so many living in first-world nations.  (Caveat emptor.)

Key words being: "computer failure" and "separate insurance policies."  The FDIC is basically setup to insure against bank insolvency.  Banks can, and often do, buy additional coverage (not provided by the FDIC) to insure against additional problems.  But the scope of the FDIC is fairly limited.
Regarding you second question, I'm pretty sure it can be hacked with the right implant (rootkit).  But that doesn't mean "...it's impossible to safely generate transactions."
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:57:52
"safely" is relative here.  Compared to the number of banks that got hacked in the '90s (which incidentally: hacked funds aren't covered by the FDIC) I'd say generating a transaction is pretty darn safe.

So far I don't buy the prosecution's case for this.  But in fairness, my knowledge of the case is pretty topical and I haven't reviewed the case notes, and likely won't be.

So you posted the basic interest equation.
That's cute.  And frankly, that's better than I expected.  Indeed, it suggests you did attend highschool.  Congratulations!
Where your lack of analysis enters is three-fold:
You've arrived at a 4-digit resolution (47.11%) from a statement I made that he had "approximately doubled" his value.  That in itself is cause for questioning your sanity, but we'll skip that for now.
The issue at hand *isn’t* what interest rate corresponds to just a doubling of value.  It’s what interest rate corresponds to the return he received.  Since resolution is important to you, start with the actual evidence on hand, not my (or anyone else's) offhand (and stated "approximately") conclusions of it.  That is, the starting price of ~$99 to now at ~$225.  That's a 2.27 multiplier of his value, during a period I’ll estimate to be about 540 days or 1.48 years.
The investment in bitcoin doesn’t compound.  It’s not a bank account.  It’s not subject to accrued or compounded interest.  But I feel your need in doing so, to be able to compare the value he gained to that of a comparable *annual* percentage rate.  The key word here is *annual*.  So to make that comparison, use a time value in years, not months (set n=1.48 or thereabouts, depending on what you think a reasonable starting time is).  Other than that, the equation you used is fine, and should result in a ~74% APR.  Hence, my stating that your number was off, even though I hadn’t done the math yet.
By the way, I didn’t mean to be offensive.  When my own numbers are off, I take no issue getting corrected.  It’s just another day at the office.  But yes, to address your other point, I do find it easy to dismiss people with MBAs.  Their degree simply isn’t that meaningful to me, especially when I see the types of mistakes they make on a regular basis.

The funny thing is that testnet coins routinely pick up value, against the devs wishes.  (This is one of the reasons the testnet periodically gets reset.)  So according to this draconian NY regulation, even testcoins could be subject to prosecution.  Is a prosecution like that likely to succeed?  Of course not.  But it will still cost you $200,000+/- to find out.  And unlike the UK, those funds are most likely not recoverable in US civil courts.

In the rare occasion it happens, that's what the bond is for.  Strap an ankle bracelet on him, and he won't be leaving.

Yes, and it's only been tested for a blink of an eye in historical terms.
If I remember correctly the first US currency, issued during the revolutionary war was a fiat and failed miserably.

I'm not sure there is one.  If you'd like to help the cause, reach out to the rest of the world.  r/bitcoin is already made up of converts or trolls.
Sign up for accounts at business weekly, nytimes, forbes, wallstreet journal, etc. and comment your thoughts when an article about bitcoin shows up.  The press often gets bitcoin wrong, so it's helpful to speak up when they do.  It's also great to changetip folks on youtube, twitter, facebook, etc.
And have fun during these times!  Once this technology catches on, it will become powerful, but a lot less fun.

Thank you.  Couldn't your transfers work by someone simply setting up a bitcoin ATM near your family's nearest city?  By them entering their key, (which you've already funded), and just make a peso withdrawal?
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:30:17
And how does that relate to the OS?  Oh yea, it doesn't.

A century that saw money backed by commodities turn into fiat currency, and there's been repeated monetary disasters ever since.
I think it would be cool if some nation like Switzerland said, "We've had enough" and went back to backing their currency with gold.  The value of their currency would likely sky-rocket.

Yes, and it's a question of direction as well.
Big money continues to consolidate in the US, UK, China, India, Brazil.  But continues to diversify in the Bitcoin world.

Embarrassingly so.  Thankfully my girlfriend knows to not test the waters like that.

True, a log chart isn't more accurate than a linear.  And a linear isn't anymore accurate than a log.  Obviously, it's the same data, just displayed differently.  And how many people knew about bitcoin, and when, is largely irrelevent to the question at hand.
Saying things such as:


suggests a novice outlook.  Log charts are useful at identifying a lot of things, that may not be obvious by a linear chart.

Yes, Dave of [HashingIt]( fame as been working on just what you're talking about.  He's got a [great talk]( about mining stats and problems with bitcoin.  (Slides are in the comments.)

worth reading.  Thanks!

When Bitcoin replaces 1% of worldwide M2, it will have only just begun.  And at that level, a single bitcoin would likely be worth around USD$30k.
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:08:50
Very true.
They've been trying to float this idea that somehow they're decentralised, as well as open-source.  And frankly, they're neither.  They're "gateways" are controlled and/or certified by Ripple and their source-code is only partially open.
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:28:08
Besides being a shit article, this has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 09:31:53
Fair point.  Seems a pricey alternative to not simply learning how to use a bitcoin ATM (I understand they're not rolled out yet there, but if they were...)  AUD $90+ is decent money in PHP.
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:09:16
Thank God.  I thought they were using an Audi.

Of course, but a sub-network can become so overwhelmingly powerful, users forget about the larger context.  Just as today HTTP dominates the casual user experience, while they have little idea what TCP/IP is.

They're already not even complying with their own regulations.
During the first public commentary period, I looked up the appropriate contact info from their site.  In addition to finding it, I found the following statement regarding the bit-license:


So I requested a copy of any "statements and analyses."  Never received it.  I then FedEx'd my request with proof-of-delivery.  Receipt was confirmed, but still no response.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:32:00
I'd like to see bitcoin held up as a form of communication, which at it's heart is truly what it is.  And then protected by only one government regulation:  the first amendment.

I think we all do.
What amazes me is how she did absolutely no research, except to:
1. apparently look through a phone directory,
2. then befriends Dorian by pretending to be into model trains,
3. then in a single instance, when she addresses him as Satoshi (his middle name), and he replies "Yes?" she concludes from that exhaustive research that he is Bitcoin's author.
Her stupidity is beyond belief.  Clearly, Satoshi respects his anonymity.  Did she really think he was trying some double-reverse extra-clever anonymity by living under his own name?
She's now been questioned at length over the article, but true to her IQ, she's sticking with her claim.  While most American journalists aren't quite this bad, I'd say she's fairly representative of the lot.

I forgot to mention there are winners and losers to this game.  This isn't one of the winning answers.

It's an exchange.  Processing USD/credit cards/bank transfers.  Of course it's going to be regulated, either by state or self.  What exactly is the author looking for?
@_date: 2015-02-15 03:54:13
Ripping someone off?  Is that what it's called if two people engage in a mutually agreed transaction and one party thereafter loses value?  If so, you might as well hold car dealerships accountable every time someone drives off a car lot in a new car losing a few grand in value right there.

Ripple has no market cap.  It's a bunch of made-up nonsense.  I remember when they were calculating their market cap by using *all* their XRPs, i.e, even the ones out of circulation.  Games like that show intent.
