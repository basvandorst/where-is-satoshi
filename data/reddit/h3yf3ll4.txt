Doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:51:10
Redditards are always super concerned what people think of them and need to be viewed favorably by everyone. They need to be seen as smart, and funny, and altruistic. They need the ego stroke and the pat on the back. 
4chan, by nature, gives no fucks. 4chan, incidentally, produces much better content which filters on down to reddit who then latches on and drives it into the ground with their neediness and thirst for approval. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:51:30
Delicious pasta. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:07:05
I think you mean "4chan is too chaotic, fast, and hard to follow for most people so they prefer the relative order, slow pace, and ease of reddit". 
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:31:33
Oh boy an internet petition. Can't wait to see what this doesn't change. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:29:33

Amazingly, your bias is out shining your butthurt.

I wouldn't wear something with a QR code on it because I don't want to look like a tool.

i still have the coinbase app, but keep smashing your iphones idiots.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:33:24
PM me when you're having a firesale to try and recoup anything at all from your failed business. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:17:37
4chan is smart people acting stupid;
Reddit is stupid people acting smart. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:45:16
Go smash more iPhones, you idiot babies.

Meh. My 5S will last me at least a year or two. Also I can just jailbreak it in case of catastrophic data loss. Cry me a river.

Good luck with your endeavor. I hope your dreams of printing one-off t-shirts that make people look like tools comes true. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:50:25
I can tell you're the latter.

OP's bacne is pretty gross. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:41:53
Cool. Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:41:11
a doctor and what?
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:35:46
I do care. Fuck me, right?
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:46:00
No, it's about doing whatever the fuck you want because you're going to anyway.

You have autism.

Don't try to aw shucks this away. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:01:41
It's because you want control, isn't it OP?
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:50:09
how nice of them to respond in a timely and efficient manner and not wait until their hands were forced by public shaming.
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:46:32
It's not about winning and losing.

My bitcoins have doubled in value.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:19:58
I, too, am butthurt that I can't spend my gold bars at the apple store. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:59:58
What are you crying about now?
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:25:42
delicious pasta.
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:49:33
hmm... this.
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:32:13
Look, bro, you do whatever the fuck you want. You're going to anyway. I feel the need to not remain silent when something that I feel is important gets, yet again, associated with being drug currency. For every two step forward we make we are dragged back one by the public perception of bitcoins as blow stamps. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:34:29
only if this public park camping has the intention of changing the world.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:50:33
Diversity of ideas, huh? Then how about we get away from "bitcoins=drug coupons"? Got any new or diverse ideas or is it still just internet dope currency?
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:47:59
I've been busy all day, what did I miss that's being over-cared about?
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:58:23
But you recognized it as a hashtag, didn't you? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:26:35
I'm not going to be tolerant and positive about another negative association. I'd be positive and tolerant if people were associating bitcoin with legal and positive purchases. Why not just start calling them "rape tickets"? It's just a joke, right? Everyone, even the normals will immediately understand, right?
We have the opportunity to affect how the bitcoin community and bitcoins themselves are perceived. How are we choosing to use that power? Let's just call it "cocaine money". Brilliant. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:15:31
I'm saying, explicitly, that bitcoin does not really need yet another direct drug association. I am also explicitly stating that I do not even give a single, solitary fuck how I seem to you. What I do give many fucks about is widespread, popular acceptance of bitcoin and each time someone heaps another drug joke on the pile it is another negative association I have to overcome when explaining anonymous cryptocurrency to Dave Normal the local shopkeeper.

Don't respond to what I said, cry about downvotes.

I have .67 btc happily waiting for btc to hit the $1000 mark. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:20:24
I'm not sure you and I have the same long-term goals for the public acceptance of bitcoin. President not sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:04:19
thanks for the followup. now, do i cash out my $670 or do i wait for BTC to hit 2k?
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:03:12
It's like the old joke. If I build one chair am I a carpenter? If I fix one toilet am I a plumber? But I fuck one goat..
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:01:13
Brb checking every thread on reddit for possible pertinent information to the thread I want to reply to. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:24:56
what bitcoin needs is more direct drug association.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:54:13
a doctor and a jew walk into a bar. he owns it.

You can buy drugs with cash. You can buy drugs with bitcoins. You can buy a Big Mac with cash. You cannot buy a Big Mac with bitcoins. 
See the problem? The quicker we move away from bitcoins being seen as only "cocaine vouchers" the quicker more widespread acceptance and penetration will occur. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:42:18
You're trying too hard. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:40:13
This is literally retarded. Don't you have something you could be occupying instead, OP? The outcome would be the same. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:47:11
Eh. I like leaving the back open for huge pieces, all that flat skin and open space.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:28:39

story checks out.
@_date: 2013-10-30 21:07:33
You can make all the jokes you want when I can walk into mcdonalds and buy a Big Mac with bitcoin. Until then we are fighting an uphill battle. Wouldn't you rather get some positive associations out there instead of reinforcing the current negative ones?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:41:57
No, we won't. The important thing is the intentions though. How else can you hold your self-righteousness over others?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:17:23
fuck off, cunt.
