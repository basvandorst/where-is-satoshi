That makes no sense, they would recoup their fees and then some if they validate higher fee txns. If anything this is anti-spam because the spammers have to actually pay fees instead of just having them clog the mempool until they are dropped.

Bitcoin will go down if it's just a crash. If there's a currency crisis on the other hand ...

50% chance of solving p=np in the next year? That's laughable

The max confirmation time increases polynomialy with block size. I recall reading somewhere that the worst case for a 2mb block is about 15 minutes. So ya problem becomes significantly worse
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:52:18
true, but we are all gonna have to bleed a little bit to fix this problem. Miners vote with hash power, users vote with nodes, I vote with my dollars. By dumping I'm saying "I'm out until you get your shit together" maybe if enough people dump then miners will actually get their shit together.

wtf anyone who has ever done taxes knows this

It's not up to core though, core gave a solution that would increase block size sufficiently for the time being (segwit) and it was not adopted

Trading between two cryptos is non taxable in the US, only trading crypto for USD is taxable
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:02:03
I think the solution is to dump actually... Bitcoin is supposed to be a self correcting system, so if the price of BTC drops below the point where it is profitable to mine then the miners will actually do something about it instead of just jerking off like most of them are doing now. Notice how segwit adoption is at an all time high now that the price has slipped $200? It might sound crazy but I think the best thing for Bitcoin in the long run is total Carnage and blood on the streets in the short run. I'll go back to hodling as soon as BTC starts making some forward progress.

What if I told you that you don't even have to predict the price to make money trading

Holy shit bro do you listen to yourself when you talk?
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:40:06
Holy shit...
"An obvious way to generate different candidates is to grind the
coinbase extra-nonce but for non-empty blocks each attempt will
require 13 or so additional sha2 runs which is very inefficient."
This would explain why antpool has been mining empty blocks...
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:39:11
I don't think the "people would save forever and never spend hypothesis is even true tbh. Just some fake idea propagated through the field so nobody would question the central bank. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:36:12
the power-saving exploit requires 13 extra SHA hashes only if the block isnt empty
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:48:35
the hash can be changed anytime via hardfork if this happens, in which case there will be almost no contest over which fork is valid because one will literally be completely useless, so it will basically be a soft fork.

That's a bit nit picky for you to be such a dick about it don't you think? You can barely compress random data in practice
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:59:37
You don't have to be embarrassed for me bro, I barely give a shit about real life opinions, much less those of reddit. :)
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:13:40
There is a mountain of evidence disproving random walk
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:30:23
Stock market data can be compressed, therefore it cannot be truly random without violating information theory. Google if you want more examples
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:55:47
You only need correlation for prediction, though you won't know why, just when.

Except gdax is an exchange and the coinbase app is a merchant service. So if coinbase is unable to provide liquidity their app will stop working whereas gdax will continue working because the users are the ones providing liquidity

I like bitcoin and I think ICO's are out of control, all I'm trying to say is that you and I are just as much speculators as the guys investing in ICO's. If you dismiss an ICO's because they have "Imaginary value" then why did you invest in BTC? We should dismiss ICO's for better reasons. I don't buy ICO's because their "imaginary value" is WAAAAY too high to be reasonable. If they were priced down (a lot) I would definitely be buying into some of them.
