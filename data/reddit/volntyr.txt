I would also go for this once all the details are worked out

Im currently stuck in that cycle. However, when its payday, the price is high. When after all my bills are paid and no extra funds, the price is low.  Waiting for Christmas though :)

Feel free to visit Downtown Johnny Brown's near the Civic Center near Horton Plaza.  The ATM is right inside the door to your left and only accepts bills.  It is VERY easy to use and will be planning to get more this week myself.
As far as the one in the Gaslamp area, its Nikki's and Co. Fine Jewelers.  Not sure which ATM they have though
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:21:49
Hopefully they are using dollars instead of actual physical bitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:32:00
I wonder if he would accept a few bitcoin for his re-election bids?

Ok, just submitted access to the Beta.   I really hope this takes off!
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:55:50
Now if only widespread adoption of bitcoin could go viral but then again, this is good news
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:46:41
Any proof of your wallet balance?

Heading to Downtown Johnny Browns at Lunchtime!

Try getting photos copied at Walmart.  Their copyright policy is 100+ years after the photographer died.  In their eyes, if a person took a picture in 1890 and lived to 1950, that photo would be still be copyrighted.

And paying 5.50 in fiat at Starbucks isnt too much?
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:15:03
I don't know why the OP is that surprised. Remember who owns the Wall st. Journal?  News Corp.
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:47:51
I sure hope not.  Although I am in it for the long haul, I would kill this Zombie Bearwhale in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:36:21
Not anymore.  
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:04:16
I am actually looking forward to it dropping a little bit more.  That way, I could afford some more when my payday comes in a week.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:59:24
Sure a lot of people named Mike Smith

PayPal is only accepting Bitcoin, more or less.  No one said you had to use PayPal whatsoever
@_date: 2014-09-19 23:27:16
That was Awesome! Was just at Downtown Johnny Brown's and was amazed at how easy it was. Will have to come back on Payday!
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:18:39
Google+ would be the little sister
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:54:18
Ow...thanks.  My first tip :)
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:51:06
I know.  When I went there to make a wall collage for my father in law's funeral, the supervisor of the photo department told me that Walmart goes beyond this just to be safe.  I quoted them the exact same thing you mentioned but the supervisor said she didnt care as some of the pictures were taken in Italy during WWII.
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:41:39
You might want to check your math there.  Decimal point problem
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:31:58
I seriously wished I had a 1/1000th of this type of problem.  Personally, I would sell them over a time period of a year to mitigate any potential harm to the price.  Sales of 5,000 are not that rare anymore and doesnt really hurt the price that bad, if at all.  Then again, I didnt have time for Second Life
@_date: 2014-12-01 05:20:05
I would recommend something along the lines of the whole Western Union ad.  Maybe something like BITCOIN: BETTER THAN WESTERN UNION or BITCOIN: The FUTURE IS HERE!
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:28:50
With the price of Bitcoin not really fluctuating over Black Friday (no Bearwhales or that sort), should this be an indictation of stablization?
@_date: 2014-12-01 04:38:31
The nice thing about Johnny Brown's is it has a lot better menu than Nikki's and Co.  Better drinks too 
@_date: 2014-11-18 04:08:14
Oh well, you need to be at least a Full Member

I would love to swing by but I want to Vote today
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:29:59
No, I am going to buy some but have to wait until Friday
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:15:36
Either way, I win
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:02:37
I dont know about you but I am waiting until payday (friday) to buy some more of these cheap coins
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:38:20
I will definitely be checking these charities out when I get home
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:49:50
Like I said, you panicked.  In cases like this, if you have absolutely no idea what to do, use as much of the time allotted to try and prevent this.  I can assure you those scammers were pretty surprised that you cut their ransom time that they gave to you in HALF.
If those two Tech people who work with you don't know how to fix it or even try and fix it for you, then I would start looking for better Tech people. (There is always the possibility that they could have been behind the ransomware as well but that is another thing).
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:17:31
Next time, don't panic, ok?  When you pay scammers like this, they will just get emboldened to do it again and again and again....Besides, you had a full 13 hours left.
Still head over to and have them help you completely clean your system.  Because guess what?  Who is to say those same scammers wont be back to get more money out of you?
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:24:46
First off, try and talk to the people in There are several different types of this type of scam and a few of them have been defeated and removed from the infected system.  They will be able to direct you to a better solution then paying that ransomware crap
@_date: 2015-10-26 02:26:06
Oh, if only it was that easy for Public Employees
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:58:27
I know that at least one of the two Bitcoin ATM's in San Diego doesn't even get plugged in anymore.  While it was the first one in this city to have one, there has been a sign on it for months to simply call the number listed and someone will meet you in person
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:18:00
Not at home right now or I might
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:17:06
Actually, you might want to use a Debit card to buy any Bitcoins.  If you use a credit card, you will get dinged with a Cash Advance fee on the credit card.
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:54:05
Sent PM
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:39:15
Just sent you a PM of the stuff that was listed.  I can also forward the screenshot I took this morning
@_date: 2015-03-16 14:23:55
I will have to do it when I get home as I am at work right now.  But Yes, I was trying to send money to my sister in law via the Send an Inmate money link and poof, I got the above code.
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:00:10
You would be surprised about prisoners with cell phones.
In order to send money to a prisoner, you need to send it to the jail.  When they get the money, they put it on a card for the prisoner.  Apparently, the only way to do this is thru Western Union
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:53:56
Yes, I do realize that but when something loses half its value overnight, thats hard in my book
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:15:23
True but it does legitimize Bitcoin just a little bit more
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:43:19
I think you are right.  Just a minute ago, saw about 210 Bitcoin hit China
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:11:00
This almost sounds like a future business opportunity waiting to happen.  A person being able to rent out at secured room in a bank to facilitate an electronic transaction.  Bank makes money for the rental of the room, more people become knowledgeable about digital currency which in turns makes it more mainstream. Bank also checks currency for counterfeiting.
Still needs to get rid of the stigma of money laundering though
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:10:20
Which moon though?  I am thinking maybe Io or Triton perhaps
@_date: 2013-07-25 02:53:36
Ok, sell the machine in pieces then.  Problem solved
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:16:11
I sure hope so.  I get paid this friday with my new contract.  Rent will already be paid to boot!
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:24:49
Why not just call them uBits and mBits
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:04:09
From the website:
At BitcoinBath we combine payments from multiple users making it near impossible to know which funding inputs (Bitcoin addresses) were used to pay which outputs (Addresses being paid). Ultimately your coins are returned to you almost as clean as the day they were mined.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:17:15
What I am taking away from this article is FINCEN is claiming that since he is considered to be transmitting money, the US Government is recognizing Bitcoin as actual money as FINCEN is part of the US Treasury Dept.. IMHO, its just one step closer to legal tender for Bitcoin.  If it wasnt actual money, FINCEN wouldnt really care about it.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:44:09
You mean to tell me you trusted a Reddit user that has only been here, counting today, for three days?  Fool and their money...
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:29:02
If the seizedBitcoin is not declared legal currency in the US, what would it be declared as?  Computer product?  If so, would that type of thing be listed in one of the Government auctions?
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:56:26
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:29:59
The problem with that, unlike JPMorgan, people like Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:28:28
Hell no if it means that the likes of Ray Kurzweil is given any more publicity
