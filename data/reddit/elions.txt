With trends of hype also comes the reality part of Bitcoin. Much of the price going up was people being very enthusiastic about it, this brings the attention of people and, of course, their interest pikes (I may have written that wrong) the price.
Once the reality of Bitcoin settles in, AKA: They see not just the advantages but some of the hurdles that Bitcoin is still going through at the moment, the price goes down, as people seem less interested and are being much more cautious on the matter.
It's a bit of a roller coaster, really. And many currencies deal with this sort of thing.

I post my podcast here when it pops up as it's a good site to promote yourself from, like many others promote their ideas or services through it.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:02:36
It's a good idea. While Bitcoin scams get posted on the subreddit all the time they tend to get lost in the sea of otherwise random or important news.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:57:36
Not to mention the issues of obtaining a credit card AFTER getting a bank account, and then trying to not get that credit card stolen or copied.
Bitcoin solves all of that in one fell swoop
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:05:15
Could be. The number of Zombie Bitcoin could, in fact, be lower than what this graph says. 
A lot of people do tend to hold onto their bitcoins for ages, or sometimes they don't have the chance to spend them as often as they'd like.

I think, what both of these guys mean, is that it's very difficult, if not nigh impossible for most people that are serious about crypto-currency to take something like Dogecoin seriously.
It's a crypto currency in it's technical form, yes, but it spawned out of a meme as a mean joke towards Bitcoin. 
I won't make a criticism over wether Dogecoin is viable as currency regardless of how it started, but the way it did makes a lot of people feel uneasy towards it, and honestly, I cannot blame them.

I envy you. Right now I haven't been able to find a place near me that sells stuff in Bitcoin. I know a restaurant recently started taking Bitcoin payments in my country's capital, but I haven't had the chance to go there yet.
Still, might be a good excercise to show my friends and family that "Bitcoin isn't a sham" if I buy them dinner there one day
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:27:52
Being honest here. It's a bit difficult getting your podcast out there. I worked on a possible project with some other people but it quickly fell apart due to the time zone differences and the like. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:23:48
Pretty obvious spam... Reported.
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:02:49
How is this spam? It's a podcast site, with a real interview with the man.
@_date: 2014-01-20 21:56:33
Wave of negativism followed by a wave of positivism. I'd say to be carefull as the bad stuff could come around the corner.
Still, like always, it's a good idea to read as many different places for news as possible to get a good feel of how things really are. You don't want to have too much of a positive view because then you'll be blindsighted to possible mistakes or danger
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:09:58
Much as i'd like to say that wouldn't happen... Yeah...
If graffiti artists take credit for someone else's work sometimes (The minority but nonetheless something that happens from time to time) there wouldn't be much to stop them from replacing QR codes in the middle of the night.
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:57:54
The problem is currently getting the stuff itself to people rather than to interest them in it. There's already an interest for Bitcoin in South america, a very lively one that is still growing inmensely, but the fact of the matter is that it's still hard for people down here to get Bitcoin apart from the few that understand english well enough and have proper contacts for it. Something which isn't exactly common (Not yet at least.)
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:14:57
I want to see one of these installed in Argentina or Chile. We'd really get some good use out of them.
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:47:11
I feel like that argument is... incomplete. 
Plus, I have to disagree on the idea that Bitcoin should be the only accepted crypto-currency. Crypto-currency is a concept that isn't solely defined by Bitcoin
Bitcoin is it's most accepted example, but it's certainely not the only one. And the same potential that Bitcoin has of being accepted as a form of purchase exists in Litecoin. The arguments that are used against Litecoin can technically be used against Bitcoin as well, but the idea is still the same with both (to an extent, of course), which makes it hard to go against one and accept the other without making some compromises, or keeping double standarts.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:24:29
This list also has some good information on legal milestones for Bitcoin too, in case anyone is interested.
@_date: 2014-01-25 05:19:40
Unfortunately true. Still, this is one explanation to the phenomenon, not the absolute truth.
That said, i'd love to hear other points of view on it.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:00:31
It's a weird question to ask. What could those 4 million be used for? are they even GOING to be used? Let's hope that if they do they get used for the better, not the worse.
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:17:48
Perception is, sadly, more important than reality.
@_date: 2014-01-12 00:15:02
Oh, don't worry. I'm marking this to read it up later. I'm just explaining why they would be against the idea of reading things on a dogecoin sub
It's important to not only make a good message, but make sure that the message is displayed in a medium that won't push people away.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:52:07
They'll post it here anyhow from time to time, so a tag would certainely make things easier for everyone. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 04:17:04
I just did a quick read of the general rules. It seems I did need to educate myself on them. That said, I still stick by all the proper rules for this subreddit.
All of my posts are related to Bitcoin in this subreddit. And i'll refrain from simply posting the podcast and leaving it at that for now. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:39:28
I covered this recently with Juan llanos in an interview, but I figure it wouldn't be bad to recap some of the stuff in a simple manner.
To note, these things would also help people in countries like Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Columbia and Brazil.
* **The currencies in South America are not very stable**
Particularly when it comes to the Argentinean peso, the value goes up and down heavily, and much alike what happens with other countries in South America, people do not trust the banks when it comes to handling the currency itself either. Several issues with the government's way of handling the economy as well as banks having... less than friendly policies, cause people to consider keeping their money in other currencies. Dollars are the most common. Of course, this is not a practice that's massified just yet, but it's one option that people who are concerned are using.
* **It's easier to buy ANYTHING online with it**
This is the one point that seems to work for all countries that are interested in Bitcoin, but it's much more pronounced in South America, precisely because of the issues with banks that I mentioned earlier.
Buying online requires a credit card, which many people dislike to down here due to the many issues with banks and their policies. High rates, or difficulty to get the credit cards, along with the issue of taking care that the credit card itself isn't duplicated, which sadly is a **very** common practice down here.
With Bitcoin they can just order up whatever they need online right away, and get it in a much quicker fashion. Specially considering that some banks down here are known for having... Less than favourable customer support in case something bad happens to your credit card.
* **Bitcoin can almost entirely take away third parties**
Following the same thread of disbelief of banks, many people in South America wish to take away third parties from transactions, which Bitcoin can do very quickly.
The reasons why they want to take away third parties are varied, of course, but the main gist of it is keeping control of their businesses without regulations that many people do not have any faith in.
It's the basics of how it is, and of course, i'm butchering up some of the reasons for the sake of simplicity here. There are many more reasons of course, one of the more interesting ones is the fact that many entrepeneurs in South America want to get ahead of the technology curve rather than stay behind like it has happened in the past. Please consider that things like Credit Cards weren't widely available in countries like Chile (Where I currently live) untill about 10 years after these became popular.
The problem right now is that there are no good ways for these people to get Bitcoin. Exchanges have come and gone, and most Bitcoin trading is done through forums and the like. Some people in South america have to rely on systems like Paypal (which I don't need to tell you, many Bitcoiners HATE) or talking with friends abroad that have easier access to Crypto-currency.
@_date: 2012-07-16 05:46:17
They're using Bitcoins to pay for it. As well as normal money. And there is the fact that it drives more interest into Bitcoin if it's being used to buy more products.
@_date: 2012-07-14 22:52:22
There's more information than simply "why" it fluctuates but why it's fluctuating currently. And this is information that in it's full extent can help some people in the long run.
@_date: 2012-07-10 03:17:38
Hopefully so. I'll have to research a little and write something about it for tomorrow/past tomorrow. To keep people informed properly :P
@_date: 2012-07-10 01:43:23
Not at all. Most of the time you can see a decay rather than an improvement. Only in Argentina and Brazil does it show any good signs, but alas, Argentina and Brazil are not the whole of south america, but a small portion 
@_date: 2012-07-15 23:49:06
Do explain how it's nonsense. It seems a lot of people are gaining interest in their processors lately, and i think it's a stretch to say that they haven't been getting preorders for their new line already
@_date: 2012-07-10 01:42:39
Nothing at all. And the progress only seems to go slower to be honest.
@_date: 2012-07-05 21:13:28
I think you'll find this small guide me and my friend put up usefull for understanding a little bit about Bitcoin. 
It is good that you're informing yourself about Bitcoin though. Way too many people get into this without realising how important it can be. This is literally money we're working with, not just pretend stuff.
@_date: 2012-07-18 21:57:51
I actually have a small post out on my page that may come in handy.  
Feel free to take anything out of it and put it there, though you seem to have most of the stuff i touched already covered.
@_date: 2012-06-29 23:23:49
If you like it do let me know what other issues you'd like for me to cover on the site. We're just starting but we have ambitious goals :)
@_date: 2013-05-21 03:40:53
More than likely i'd move away from the country. Or at least save up the money to start the process of moving away. Immigrating is hard as all hell when you've got no money
@_date: 2013-09-20 22:17:35
It doesn't surprise me at all, Bitcoin's a pretty interesting thing for South America right now, specially for those of us that need a better way to buy things online.
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:19:10
Agreed. I'd just like it if people IN the bitcoin movement could also appreciate that every once in a while instead of taking the super-negative route towards these news
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:31:18
I'm on the "It comes and goes" field as well. I'm not too worried for the pop as I am worried of people exagerating things with the prices
@_date: 2013-08-13 20:22:00
I would not call it a success, so much as I would call it a "good and major step.". 
We need court precedents to show that Bitcoin is accepted by legal bodies, both in the US and the rest of the world, and we also need people who don't necesarily know about Bitcoin and are in important positions, like judges and business owners, to understand Bitcoin better
Unfortunately i'm still seeing that the Bitcoin community doesn't understand the legal part either.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:22:43
Any specific reasons why? I know there's quite a few but I wanna know what everyone thinks on the matter
@_date: 2013-09-03 04:04:35
Agreed. But I also share the opinion that Litecoin just seems to have more application for day to day transactions than Bitcoin. It's more appealing in a way when you hear someone trading for something that's not in the 0.X numbers.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:33:47
You'd be surprised how many people don't really research investments, both related to bitcoin and otherwise. Very good advice really, even if it seems basic.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:01:52
Thanks for the heads up. I don't know if you can tell, but English isn't my first language. I'll fix it up on the Site 
@_date: 2013-07-06 22:30:03
It does depend heavily on it however, which is where i'm coming from with the idea. 
I can agree that I might have used "Centralized" wrong, but you have to admit the dependancy on certain specific companies is a worrysome thing currently.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:23:29
It's one of the reasons why I say that this is going different so you never know what will really happen. That said I still say that it'll have to go down eventually, we just don't know when... Or how much it will go down.
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:49:12
I'm not saying it's a bad idea or that it necesarily needs a change, it just feels like the timing might not be the best.
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:04:27
I got warned this would happen, but I had already posted it.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:51:10
Pretty cool story. Chile's one of the few places where there seems to be some interest in Bitcoin at the moment, at least interest in the way that you can actually make some proper business here and there.
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:13:32
 This video shows pretty well how it works. This video however is from a few months ago so take it with a hint of salt.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:55:03
For the record, for those that might say that this seems like a bit of "obvious" advice. I feel like a lot of people tend to forget how easy and powerfull this can actually be. 
Word of mouth can sometimes be more powerfull and faster than an ad campaign, and in all honesty, many of us forget to do so because we think "What's the point? My friends and family aren't big players in economics".
You'd be right. They aren't big players, but they are the BASE of economics. The consumers, the people who use these things in their everyday lives, and talking more to them on the matter, informing them, and even getting them excited about the prospects of something like Bitcoin can take things that one step further that we all want.

Mind elaborating a little bit? I'd just like to know why you don't think so
@_date: 2013-07-07 01:53:42
I see what you mean. I feel many a times that the only way for this to remain short-term is if people do start using other places, which sadly no one seems to be doing (I've seen more than one exchange/attempt at enterprising with Bitcoin fail miserably because no one pays attention to it) 
@_date: 2013-08-13 21:07:00
I'm gonna have to implement this on my site later.
@_date: 2013-04-27 05:41:29
Not a bad idea... This is the first time either one of us really goes forward with a podcast, so we're currently testing out different ways to both record and get it to people.
Next episode's gonna have a download link, don't worry.
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:21:17
This is very true. It's unfortunate that the "climate" in other countries isn't precisely good for Bitcoin, but it doesn't mean it can't advance yet.
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:49:36
Huh, I didn't know that there were a few others podcasts, i'll have to take a look into them later

To be honest it was just a bit of google searching :P
