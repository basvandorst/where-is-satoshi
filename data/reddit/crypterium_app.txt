We are working on a global solution that will be able to make crypto available for everyday transactions. The world will be a better place having global adoption of cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, we don't live in a world like this, but someday we will. Note that we are working on different partnerships that will make our services available worldwide, one of them is our crypto card that will be available very soon. Stay tuned for official updates!

Thank you for your continuous support.

Try being polite first so that you don't sound like every paid anti-Crypterium 'user'. 
We're in the process of issuing the first 5000 cards to the market, at the same time we're in the middle of launching our marketing campaign - stay tuned for more information and watch us how we will handle the millions of crypto to fiat transactions processed through the network.

Our application will help millions of people get acquainted with Bitcoin and other digital currencies in easiest way. That will increase the involvement of people in the blockchain technology
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:17:52
Currently BTC ETH and LTC, but other tokens will be supported very soon.

When employers are paying their employee's in Bitcoin directly to their personal wallet of choice, with Crypterium, whatever they can do with traditional money they will able to do with digital assets. This idea is supported, among others, by the co-founder of TechCrunch Keith Teare and over 400,000 registered users, and the number is growing by day.
We respect your perspective. Right now, this is the option we see possible for a brighter crypto world. If you doubt the project, we respect you, it is probably for the best that you seek other means of crypto buying and stop insisting your point of view. Let us have some respect on different opinions. But if you like what you read and see from Crypterium, we will be happy to have you aboard. 
With much respect.

Hi! Crypterium has already released [a feature that allows you to spend crypto on everyday expenses]( by transferring it directly to bank accounts.
Paying your mortgage and loans, bills and taxes, and even your gym membership with crypto - all at once is now a reality. Users can also make bank transfers to personal accounts, which means they can not only refill their own balance, but easily send money to friends and family in other countries.

Hello  ! Technically, Applied commissions will be calculated automatically and shown on the confirmation screen. On the confirmation screen there are two types of fees:
Crypterium gas. Crypterium’s crypto-to-fiat engine requires a fee of 0.5% of the transaction in CRPT tokens with their subsequent burning. It will be applied at the moment of transaction
Blockchain fee. It depends on several factors including network congestion.
No other fees are applied from Crypterium’s side. You can find more details about our project and transactions in our Whitepaper : [

Hi there. Thank you for reply. I want point that there is also no example of an era when the primitive walked in the skins and hunting on mammoths. Guess why?) You're right - because the article is about Money and its history. Be more kind and supportive, much exciting things are come;)

The video is real. Your words are not justified. Our team is actively developing Crypterium app and our goal is to provide a range of banking-level services throughout the world! And we are the first who is making this already today. So, we can say that Crypterium global card is the first one

Sure they do. CRPT is used as gas, so users can top up their cards with BTC (Other tokens to be added shortly). The user can then use their card to purchase items at UnionPay accepting locations. We provide the bridge between digital asset to fiat purchases. The Bitcoin is deducted from the users account instantly upon purchase.
