Yes. See below:


the ChainAnchor architecture that adds an identity and
privacy-preserving layer above the blockchain, either the private
blockchain or **the public Blockchain in Bitcoin**
Private blockchains don't need an overlay to "anchor" them into compliance because, being private, they can be designed with permissioning and compliance built in or can be hard forked for the same.
As a matter of fact there isn't a single publicly reported case of a private blockchain that uses PoW mining as a form of consensus and I doubt that MIT receives research grants to solve non-existing problems.

Damage control is still possible to some extent but would first require to stop acting in denial.
@_date: 2016-04-29 12:53:10
That's exactly the reason you need fine grained permissions. If I install a plugin that I authorize only to access say my BTC and to send them only to a specific set of whitelisted addresses, there is precious little the plugin could do to hurt me.
Plugins should be denied **everything** by default other than running code that can't do any i/o. Then it should be allowed specific things with user approval, like access this or that exchange using this or that account only, and access this or that crypto using only this or that address etc. User should be able to grant / revoke permissions one by one. Plugins should get exceptions when they are trying to use a feature that requires a permission that was denied by the user and know to fail gracefully and/or continue in degraded mode if the feature was not absolutely necessary.
Fine grained permissioning is what Blackphone / Silence OS is doing with its appstore. It's the only way to allow applications to be entirely harmless regardless of what their code does. This allows trustless use of arbitrary code. If there is one field where this is necessary, it's  crypto. I know I will **never** let arbitrary code access to my exchange accounts or crypto wallets unless I can control exactly what it is allowed to do with it.

@_date: 2016-04-27 08:21:57
You are making a strawman and trying to spin the debate to make it look like the heat around ChainAnchor is tinfoil hatting.
Nobody seriously thinks MIT intended to actually implement that scheme themselves. They are a research institution, not a cyber warfare unit or a regulatory agency. They were ordered that research and did it. The question of who ordered that research and what is their intent is another story.
The heat comes from MIT's denial of the fact the research was intended to apply to Bitcoin when there is overwhelming and undeniable evidence of the same. MIT is trying to defend an unsustainable position so the heat will keep growing until they stop creating cognitive dissonance, recognize the hard facts and move on to explain their motivations.
Nobody would be shocked if MIT just said they were researching an attack vector against Bitcoin. Hal Finney did just that and it was perceived as a useful contribution because he was upfront about it and nobody had any reason to doubt that his intent was good.
Nobody would be really surprized either if MIT just explained that this research was ordered by the SEC or the FSA or other gov agency to determine the feasibility of retrofitting Bitcoin and other PoW blockchains in the existing regulatory framework. We all expect the government to try to extend the reach of law to blockchains and its only normal for research institutions to do research including for government agencies. We already know that MIT is doing some research for the NSA and nobody is making a big deal out of it.
What is not OK however is to see members of a prestigious institution acting like they are obviously trying to hide something, lying through their teeth and behaving like trolls on public forums in spite of the fact there is undeniable evidence that they are not being honest.
Get your shit together MIT. It's ok to do research on attack vectors. It's ok to contract for government agencies. But it's not ok to lie and try to get away with it.

There are different use cases. Some apps are **not** supposed to make payments or shouldn't make payments to a random address that wasn't whitelisted explicitly. For instance if I use a bot plugin to do arbitrage between exchange accounts, it should only be able to send funds between designated exchange accounts. It should be possible to have that level of restriction if the user wants it. That way the user can just download any plugin and still be sure that nothing can happen that he hasn't approved explicitely.
Of course there are use cases where it wouldn't be practical but in that case the user should be requested to approve explicitely such behavior and the sandbox layer should still have a pop up to approve payment (with a "don't show this again" tick box of user really wants to trust entirely the plugin).




"Don't show this again" will do. That or your allow users to chose a profile with advanced user getting to see and set all the fine grained details.
I'm currently in the process of doing what you are already doing (that is to say implementing connector modules for each exchanges and type of crypto) for a trading framework I am developing. I get no added value doing all that extra work so if your app has the right level of security for handling safely 5 or 6 digit figures trading flows, I'd consider using Mycellium as a connectivity backend for my application. I would even consider having a pure Mycellium plugin as one of the apps I would offer to my users.
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:41:58

@_date: 2016-04-24 04:48:48
Are you only reading the headlines or actually reading articles before posing as the champion of science?
Let me quote the article


The study doesn't show **at all** that bigger blocks don't increase centralization. On the countrary it proves they do: **here 10% or 450+ nodes would drop off from the network with 4mb blocks** and these likely are nodes from countries with filtered Internet which are the ones that need Bitcoin the most. The point of the study was only to **quantify** the impact of the increase of the block size.
Nothing new under the sun. Core already knows that they can tradeoff some bandwidth in exchange of sacrifying nodes on the altar. The point being that there is absolutely no need for this sacrifice when the bulk of the traffic is currently spam generated by large boockers to make it seem like blocks are full, and exchange deposit / withdrawal which will all move to lightning anyway.

They didn't move on to other things. At all. They just changed the wording of the whitepaper to make it sound more politically correct before they publish it. The core is still the very same scheme to attempt to pervert and denaturate permissionless blockchains to force them into submission to centrally dictated compliance requirements.
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:38:24
If you won't let plugins send crypto to addresses that have not been explicitely whitelisted, that can't happen. That's the point of **fine grained** permissions. Creating and signing a Bitcoin transaction should only be done by the trusted Bitcoin code. All that a plugin should be able to do is ask the Bitcoin module to craft and send a transaction, and for this to happen the external function call should check all parameters and make sure that the address provided and amount match with what the user has explicitely approved to be whitelisted. 
If that's already what you planned, then it wouldn't be mycellium's problem / shortcoming if a user downloads a random plugin and approves the permission it requests without reviewing them carefully. In the example you give, the plugin should have to have approval to create pop-ups, call back home via the Internet to get add content, and make BTC transactions to a specific address. A careful user will have reviewed that the address provided is indeed that of Starbucks. 
My point is that an advanced user should be able to control **every permissions** so that it would become impossible for a plugin to misbehave regardless of what its code does. Currently I'm emulating that using Qemu VMs (one per wallet software) and fine grained iptables permissions. If Mycellium handles that natively and offers a plateform that runs on Linux I'm interested to switch and even invest in the project.

I am not equatting anything to anything. I asked what was the evidence that the moon landing actually happened. You tried to answer that by reductio ad absurdum, namely pointing that Russia would have released the intelligence they had on the moon landings had this not been real. 
I'm just telling you that this reasonning isn't valid because you are making invalid assumptions on how modern states are managing information and making wild guesses on Russia's motives. Assuming Russia has compelling intelligence on Apollo 11 missions, an equally good explanation for the fact they haven't released it publicly is simply that they don't stand to benefit from doing that at the moment, or that they have already released it via indirect leaks that you are calling conspiracy theories.
I'm not having a horse in this race. Just pointing that available evidence that supports the theory whereby the moon landings actually happened is as flimsy as evidence to the contrary, and insufficient to establish it as a fact.

Interesting analogy, but not totally accurate. A plane is not a very redundant system save for the two engines and the engineered redundancy of some of the equipment. A single human error made by a single human being can crash a plane with very little consensus and cross-checking having taken place and no way (at least as far as we know) to reverse / backtrack to before the error happened or warp into another alternate reality where the crash wouldn't have happened.
I agree that in the case of Bitcoin the construct is ultimately being derived / iterated upon by software and that a human error in one of the more popular client could lead the consensus to go down an invalid derivation path provided other conditions are met involving typically a series of failures by multiple parties representing more than 50% of the hashrate with respect to review, testing, monitoring and deployment.
But the main difference isn't even in the degree of redundancy and required quorum that prevents such occurence but in the fact that in case of error it's not even the construct that changes but the consensus by humans who derive it and decide which of the many possible derivations of the state of the construct they agree is valid and should be canon. The construct, all its past known instanciated states, all its known alternate states all continue to "exist" in that weird mathematical sense that they remain computationnally reachable. Human error in that context doesn't actually affect the construct itself. It affects the relative position of the collective consensus with respect to what derivation is right. Should the error be detected, the understanding wouldn't be that the construct has failed but that the state humans and software have built has diverged from it and isn't in fact pointing anymore to the correct construct. In that case it would be possible to backtrack to the point of divergence and resume from there. That branch would in fact probably already have been derived given that there are multiple implementations of the protocol that are unlilely to be all affected at the same time by the same set of human errors and will have derived a valid alternate path / fork.
This is not to say that the occurence of such a series of human errors and failures wouldn't affect the perception that the market has of the relative practicality and value of the products and services based on the construct. But as such human error cannot affect the mathematical object because by definition of the object, it simply cannot be derived into an invalid state and simply ceases being that object the moment an error is introduced.

They just tend to be more successful and more likely to reach a position of authority because they seek power and control and have very little qualms doing anything it will take to get there including lying, cheating or harming other people.
Nerds on the other hand tend to belong in majority to the autistic spectrum which does have a significant skew toward high intelligence and analytical abilities and poor social skills. Alhough autists are generally out of touch with the neuro typical "norm" and can seem aloof and distant, they have a normal ability to empathize and a normal sense of morality.

That's not how things work. Governments hardly ever go frontally against other governments or call them out publicly on their lies and deceptions unless they really have a very strong incentive to do so, are in a dominant position and are pretty damn sure that they can keep the situation under control when SHTF.
Every government has mountains of dirt on every other government and more specifically on every single of their officials. That's the entire point of intelligence. They spend billions every year collecting and classifying all that dirt. They could go balistic and release all that information and risk a nuclear-proportion diplomatic meltdown, but the fallout could be disastrous and would probably undermine national security, their very own power, their domestic credibility or even endanger people's trust into the current global power structure when all is said and done. But that's not what they do. Governments understand that [knowledge is power]( They take a very careful and methodical approach to managing information: they compartimentalize it, classify it, and only allow its access and release on a need-to-know basis even among high-clearance officials. Information is used as an instrument of control and bargaining between governments, or between a government and domestic and foreign invididuals through blackmail and favors. Information is only released to the public when it is determined that doing so would help further the state's agenda while having limited and manageable repercussion. And even then, the utmost care is taken to ensure that releasing the information will fulfill the intended objective while causing as little collateral damage and side effects as possible to relationships with other nations and economic interests. Indirect release through leaks and rumours is often the preferred method as it allows to put the information out there while retaining the possibility to discredit / cover it up once the desired effect has been achieved. It also allows to hedge against the risk the target nation / government / officials could openly retaliate.
Just look at the shit show that happened around the last US election just because Russia allegedly leaked a tiny fraction of all the dirt they have on the Clinton campaign via a very indirect route involving hackers and Wikileaks in an attempt to nudge a little bit the election results toward their preferred outcome while maintaining plausible deniability at state level. And yet, just this tiny leak got the whole Washington DC and US establishment in such a state of rage that they dialed the anti-Russian propaganda machine to 11 and started trying to impeach the president while giving all signs that a war with Russia was not out of question.
If a small, indirect, plausibly deniable and officially denied leak like that can cause so much turmoil, just imagine what would happen if Russia was to call out openly the US government on one of their bigger lies. They are not crazy, they aren't going to attempt that. They have a lot to lose and very little to win doing something like that. If history is any indication, many times Russia could have spilled the beans on some pretty crazy stuff, but instead just kept their mouth shut. Take [MK-Ultra]( for instance. It started with [operation Paperclip]( just after WWII when Germany was occupied by **both USSR and the US** during which the US exfiltrated **1600** german scientists, many of whom should have been judged for war crimes during Nuremberg, and instead were allowed **under Russian and US supervision**  to emigrate to the US. Do you think that Russia didn't notice all these scientists "disappearing" before they were judged, and that they had no idea that the US were conducting human experiments? Obviously they knew it, and yet they never said anything about that, at least not officially. Of course, there is no saying that MK-Ultra didn't surface partly due to Russia leaking the information strategically while maintaining plausible deniability as they always do. But they never said a word of that officially. 
When a government has decided that some specific piece of information should be released publicly, their modus operandi often involves leaking things through layers and layers of indirection in as coincidental a way as possible to retain plausible deniability. This is the very reason that you see the US establishment pushing so hard to try to retain control of the online narrative by having Facebook, Youtube and all other social media platform censor what the US government single-handedly identifies as "fake news" or "hate speech" or "non-politically correct content" or (what a coincidence) "russian propaganda". 
Given the above, don't expect you'll ever hear directly from anyone in an official position anything about controversial issues such as the assassination of JFK, the moon landings or 9/11. Instead, you'll probably never hear anything until such time that releasing the information is deemed necessary by a foreign nation, or sometime by the US government itself, from which point you will see information surface here and there via different unofficial channels and sources in a way that will initially look hard to verify. Naturally, unless the release is deliberate, this will all be immediately denied, and counter-intelligence will do its job by cleaning up, spinning the narrative and drawning the fish in a flood of other equally crazy sounding but provably fake leaks all the while making all parties involved look like a bunch of nutjobs.

If anything, Viktor's musings on the Cicada 3301 theme are more of a counter evidence about Ethereum having anything to do with Cicada (at least as far as Viktor is concerned). After all the effort they made to remain anonymous, it would make no sense to casually spill the bean in a tutorial example. But of course it's also possible that Viktor is suspecting their involvement in the project and used that example as an indirect way of signalling it.
In all likelihood, Cicada is the evolution of the cypherpunk mailing list with only the core contributors and an invite-only mode to filter the crowds of trolls and noobs. Every single thing we know about Cicada is shouting very loud that they are crypto nerds, transhumanists, cyberpunks and anarchists... Pretty much a dead giveaway...

It's still less computationally intensive to try all the permutations of a set of characters than to try to bruteforce a key with no information whatsoever. Especially if you used the characters to write BIP39 seed words.
If that happens to you and you spill the characters, take immediately a picture of the cryptosteel with whatever is still inside as well as a picture of spilled characters as the way they fell contains information about the way they were arranged before they fell and therefore about your key. Don't touch anything until you are sure you have taken enough pictures or footage to locate precisely the position of every piece relatively to each other, their direction etc. Take also a movie where you re-enact how the whole thing happened and how it fell. This may not be so usefull right now but it may make a big difference in the future when we have the technology to compute regression models from records of real world entropic processes.

@_date: 2016-06-25 16:02:20
I know what long means, just got the margin asset mixed up. You borrow the base currency only when short selling the pair so indeed you still get to buy from the market on leveraged longs so you are right that this one doesn't work.
So that lets OTC purchases dumped on the market, borrow + big dump and buy back over a long period of time, or buy first over a long period and dump it all at the most critical moment. Either way it allows someone with deep pockets to kill important rallies at the most critical times like when they are about to break through a resistance level.

Oh and I'd like to add: I have a need for a password manager beyond web apps. I also use passwords for encrypted drives, protected documents, encrypted wallets, pgp and ssh keys, sometimes ssh logins etc. So a chrome plugin isn't enough.  For full generality a python tool that allows to push to storage, retrieve from storage, add/remove/edit entries, fetch a password and of couse do all the communication with the trezor would be very useful. It can serve as a base for developers to integrate directly trezor based authentication in their app. We could even hack gwm/kwm/pamd to login in a linux box just by inserting the right trezor in the USB port. Why Python? because the trezor password manager becomes a trusted security component so it is critical to be able to check what the deployed instance does which excludes using a compiled binary.
Please trezor if you read this consider the above. If you come up with a fully general solution you will soon be selling trezors to a much larger market of non-bitcoiners but security-savyy people as well. I for one would buy several units and it would be easy to sell the idea to my company.

Your answer was credible until this point. The point of a paper wallet is to have an entirely airgapped wallet that can't possibly leak entropy. If you are going to generate it using a website created and maintained by god knows who, that uses god knows what key generation algorithm and source or randomness and serving you javascript which you have no idea is the original thing because the site could have been hacked, then you are not any better off in terms of security than trusting an exchange or online wallet in first place.

I'm not saying that having been part of the cypherpunks movement before the advent of Bitcoin implies being necessarily a wonderful human being beyond all suspicions. It does however correlate very strongly, and for good reason, with the very ideology that underlies Bitcoin, that which endeavours to restore the financial and intellectual freedom of mankind through the use of cryptography.
Cypherpunks have arguably been very dedicated to this cause at a time where there were not many incentives for doing so other than philosophical and ideological and where the US government regulations on the export of cryptography and its crackdown on anything that could facilitate spying was placing the list and its members in a potentially hazardous situation. We owe them as a group a huge bunch for all the freedom enhancing technologies they have released: PGP, TahoeLAFS, HashCash, RPOW,  Wikileaks, Bitcoin and more recently ZCash. Although the level of dedication obviously depends on individuals, cypherpunks have done quite a few things that are nothing short of heroic and have deeply changed the world. Just think of Julian Assange's still ongoing struggle to shine the light on the corruption of the world governments at the cost of his own freedom and possibly his own life, or Hal Finey still making security patches on Bitcoin by batting his single functional eyelid while being entirely paralyzed with terminal stage ALS. If that's not hardcore dedication, I'm not sure what is.
This is in contrast with the post-bitcoin era that has thrown in the mix a lot of other incentives that have made it much more difficult to gauge reliably what is really motivating people. Some (in fact many, the majority probably) have joined the movement because of economic incentives. Some have joined seeing an opportunity to gain personal power or fame. And yes some have joined the movement to infiltrate it and subvert it from the inside. In the post-bitcoin world it has become extremely difficult to tell who is who and anything that can help telling the grain from the chaff is important to look at.
In that context, pre-bitcoin involvement in pro-freedom movements such as the cypherpunks, hacking, hactivism, ancap, voluntarist or libertarian scenes is very helpful to figure if someone had genuine ideological leanings before hand. This is not a bullet proof heuristic, but it increases significantly the chances the individual in question is in for the good reasons.

I've been working many years at large investment banks. Nobody up to the top management gives a fuck about share holders, customers, or even whether the firm will still be in business the next year. The **only** thing that matters is: next bonus. After that they can hop on to another firm since all firms do exactly the same business and everyone knows each other. That's why the whole financial industry is still "Buying The Fucking Dip" even though everybody knows the equity market is overbought and due to crash. And that's also why the Fed has kept the QE music going on for so long at the cost of damaging even further the economy.

You can as easily split the coins without a smart contract. Due to difference of blocksize, fees are going to be much lower on BCH. To split, you can send the tx on BCH first to address A, with a fee that will allow it to execute immediately on BCH but will get queued on BTC. Then you can make a second transaction that spends the same outputs and send them to address B, but with a high enough fee to allow immediate execution on BTC. This effectively and safely allows to split the funds.

I don't see how skepticism toward the banking system has anything to do with this. The entire crypto community scorns the banking system. It's more than skepticism, it's understanding that the whole thing is a scam. And why "still skeptical"?

Both what?


Assuming that Blockstream, the company that has the highest concentration of notable cypherpunks in the whole crypto space, is in bed with banks or government is just that though, a crazy conspiracy theory. If anything CIA and MIT MediaLabs friendly Gavin Anderson, R3CEV shill Mike Hearn, con artist Craig Wright, and their countless collective attempt at usurping the control of Bitcoin away from core developers feel like a much more likely place to find conspiracy material if they are so enclined.

Karma is but a name for the idea that what goes around comes around. If you have ever changed your attitude to someone following something they did whether good or bad, or praised someone or bitched about someone, you have already enacted the law of karma. If you have ever felt good about yourself for doing something or felt guilty or ashamed, there goes karma again.
Karma just talks to the persistance and transitivitiy of emotional state in our reality and the very easily verifiable fact that if you act like an asshole you are setting yourself up for a painful reality check somewhere down the line.
Claiming it doesn't exist is as absurd as saying that causality doesn't exist.

Speaking of which even an email that would seem to be coming from this website or other similar service could be an attempt at social engineering. If you receive an email that seems to have been written by your husband, don't let the emotion take over rationality no matter how much you wish that message to be real. Analyze the message with a critical mind. If it really comes from your husband, he will probably have added enough personal details only the two of you know to establish authenticity. Since deadman switch services have access to the messages they send on behalf of their customers, it is very unlikely that the information contained in that email alone would be sufficient to retrieve the bitcoins as this would have allowed deadman switch operators to get the coins too. So if you receive such an email and have any doubt on its autenticity, don't hesitate to come back to this sub and check the steps and service names and service URLs on by one to make sure that the instructions are legit. Just remember to remove any series of words like "TOMATO LADDER SERENDIPITY ...." (these are called Seed Words) or random series of numbers and letters (like 0x9b8ef0a33. ..) or any other random looking data including weirdly off-topic sounding sentences like "The cats are jumping on the moon and I eat wood at office" (which could be a brain wallet key or passphrase) before you ask anyone to confirm that the instructions are legit. The rule of thumb is: if what you want to ask a question about isn't generic looking instructions in plain english, be extra cautious as it could contain elements of the key, account credentials, or details that could help subsequent social engineering, hacking or tracking.
Since you and your husband have been sharing a house, the most likely type of instructions you would receive from a deadman switch will most likely be something involving information on paper and storage devices hidden physically in your house, and it should be self-explanatory as your husband will have known that you are not familiar with crypto.
Last but not least, it would be very surprising that your husband would have had the presence of mind to setup a deadman switch while never having a conversation with you about how to access the crypto should he pass away. Usually people use deadman switches as a complement to a well discussed contingency plan.

If there is any chance that your husband could be having significant holdings (which is quite possible if he has been in crypto for several years, has invested a lot of money or time, has regularly been withdrawing significant cash amounts, or has seemed to grow more and more confident about the financial future of your family), I would recommend that you don't touch anything from your husband's crypto estate until such time that you know what you are doing. Put it all in storage in a safe place, stop using his computer entirely, disconnect everything from the Internet. Don't use the USB sticks or memory cards for anything else at the moment. Don't throw his paperwork, old computers, old disks, old CDs etc. Don't throw his favorite books or move the eventual bookmarks. Don't throw his post-its, notebooks, notes. Keep everything in storage. Your husband could have been very creative in the way he hid the private keys so if you have any doubt about the meaning of something he wrote, jotted down somewhere or printed, keep it aside just in case. You can do the clean up later once you have more clarity.
In the mean time, try to learn about Bitcoin and crypto. Open your own exchange accounts and wallet accounts in the same services your husband used, buy a bit of bitcoins, sell some bitcoins, transfer some bitcoin, setup a desktop wallet, setup a mobile wallet, do tutorials, ask questions, read conversations. After a few months doing that as a hobby, you'll have a much better understanding of the whole situation.

In order to make some progress on this, you are going to need to understand what you are doing so that you know what to do or look for next.
You mentionned that your starting point is a list of user name and passwords of "bitcoin related accounts" and that you have checked the accounts balances. This sounds like you are talking about web based services. You need to understand what are these services, and what your husband did on these services, that will tell you where the money went next.
If some of the services your husband used are on the list below, these services are "exchanges"
An exchange is a service you use to exchange between fiat (regular money) and crypto (Bitcoin of course, but also other cryptocurrencies). If your husband used this kind of services, what you are looking for is the "deposits" and "withdrawal" history. With a bit of accounting accross all the exchanges deposit / withdrawal transactions, you should be able to tell how many bitcoins (or other cryptocurrencies) your husband bought, how many he cashed out, and therefore how many are left to locate. Next step is to locate them. For that, you should make a list of all the addresses your husband deposited crypto from, and all the addresses he withdrew crypto to. If the same address was used for both deposit and withdrawal, this is very very likely a wallet. Check the balance of that address on the relevant "block explorer" (e.g.  for Bitcoin). Note that a zero balance doesn't mean that the coins are gone as they could have been transferred to another wallet also controlled by your husband. Addresses that were used only for withdrawal may or may not be a wallet controlled by your husband, so don't get your hopes up if you see a large balance in there. In general, since there are not many ways to spend crypto yet outside of ICOs (google the term), it is reasonnable to assume that your husband's holdings correspond to the difference between all the crypto he bought, and all the crypto he sold on exchanges.
The information you will find on the deposit / withdrawal page of exchanges is transaction data which isn't very sensitive (it's mostly public already since Bitcoin uses a public ledger) other than for privacy. You can safely give the printout of the deposit / withdrawal pages of each exchanges to someone you trust if you don't know how to do the accounting yourself, but know someone you can trust who is more experienced with that. Don't post publicly the exchange history though as this could attract scammers if the data shows that your husband has withdrawn and was still holding significant amounts of crypto, not to mention the possible troubles with tax authorities if your husband didn't pay his taxes on capital gains.
Once you have managed to map out how much crypto your husband has bought and withdrawn, you'll have a better idea of how much you can expect to find when you eventually locate his wallet(s).
Since your husband was apparently trading actively, note that it is very possible that he was also trading other cryptocurrencies. You can easily see that in the withdrawals section of the exchanges he was using. If all he has ever withdrawn was BTC and regular money, you are looking mostly for BTC. If there are other things such as ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH etc. things could get a whole lot more complicated.

Blockstream has AXA Venture Partners, an investment arm of AXA, as a **minority shareholder** following the **later stage** Series A investment round of **2016**


The CEO of AXA **was** Henri de Castries until 2016.


So to summarize, the "link" is that the former CEO of an insurance company that owns one of the VC funds that invested in Blockstream (among other dozens of companies) as a minority shareholder in the later stage Series A round of 2016, and who retired the very same year (take a breath) is also a chairman of the Bilderberg group?
That's a pretty damn tenuous link if you ask me. By the same token half of the companies on this planet must be somehow "linked" to the Bilderberg group one way or another given how the Bilderberg group is essentially a collusive cartel of Fortune 500 companies, governments and billionaires that collectively own or control the world economy for the most part.

Being a heroe doesn't imply being a martyr. That's just another cliché.

You are being told that politicians that are voted in office are "representative" of the people as if the voting process was some sort of magic pledge that guaranteed integrity and prevented the pursuit of self-interest. But that you are being told so doesn't make it so. 
Once in office there is very little means by which an elected "representative" can effectively assess the will of those who have elected him (neither is there a mean for electors to withdraw their support) and very little incentive to do so when the system is such that relationships and adherence to groupthink within the establishment are a much stronger determinant of success than popularity. After all, once you are in office you have a few years before the next popularity contest takes place, few years during which forging alliances within the establishment and finding strings to pull to keep your ennemies at bay are going to be key to your survival and your future career either as a politician or at a non-elected position of power within the administration or the industry. And although it's always nice to be popular you won't win at next election if you can't even make it to next election due to you not being nominated as a candidate by your party or lacking funding for your campaign or having your arm twisted by some nasty blackmail or being in bad terms with key stakeholders of large mainstream media or web companies.
Access to office is extremely well garded and rare are the politicians who can make it this far on their own without having to make deals. As a result, most of the politicians, by the time they make it big enough to have a chance to be voted in office, are already struggling with a complex situation of multi-faceted conflict of interest, favors, clientelism, pressures and sometime (too often sadly) even threats and blackmail due to the trail of "dirt" said dealings have left in their wake.
For these people, making laws and voting laws is a subtle balancing act between many forces, popularity and faithfulness to one's campain promises being but one.
Here is a simple mental experiment: imagine you run a poll and ask people if the US should continue waging wars in the middle east: what do you think the answer will be? Now look at the policy of the US government over the last 20 years wrt to warmongering in the middle east. Has it really changed with the different offices? Has it ever actually stopped? Isn't there a blatant inconsistency between the warmongering policy of the US government and the will of its people? Is the US government being "representative" of the people when it uses trillions of dollars of tax money and debt to do something morally atrocious that the people explicitely and loudly disapprove of? 
The truth is that in far too many cases it is impossible to reconciliate the actions of the US government with the aggregate will of its people.


Not when all the candidates the people can choose from all turn out to break their campaign promises once in office and fall back to the very same decades-long policy wrt warmongering, surveillance and the progressive abolition of constitutional rights. At this point the only choice people have to express their disagreement with the current policy is to refuse to vote and ask for a overhaul of the current deeply biased societal system.


You cannot vote someone out without voting someone else in. If the guy hat comes in won't actually represent you any better than the guy you just voted out by virtue of the fact the incentives are heavily stacked in favor of maintaining the status quo, you can do all the voting in and voting out you want, it won't change a thing.


That is what you are being told but again this is not how it works. The fact they have been in office and have spent most of their term cultivating relationships, making deals and generally building influence guatantees exiting politicians great positions as lobbyist, lawyers or advisors in the industry or at a non-elected position of power in the administration. This is the main plan for most politicians. Being reelected is a nice, if unexpected, bonus. A few years down the line, they can always attempt a come back. This is such a well known phenomenon in Japan that there is even a word to describe it: "amakudari". Look it up, it's worth the detour. Although it is less well known in the US, it is nonetheless exactly the same.
 &gt; But that of course requires for the people to exercise their civic duties, which again I suspect they are negligent of
"civic duties" is yet another grand sounding propaganda term for an absurd belief that portends that you are somehow magically comitted morally at birth to support and legitimize by your vote the current societal paradigm no matter how much you disapprove of it. Refusing to exercise your "civic duties" is not the problem but the solution. By refusing to vote, you are voting against the entire system and asking for its overhaul. If you do not approve of the actions of your government such as wars, torture or surveillance it is your moral duty to refuse to give it your consent.

This. One of China's top most priorities is to accelerate the downfall of the USD. They are doing everything they can to undermine the USD hegemony: trade agreements with Russia, Iran and North Korea in complete disregard of US imposed financial sanctions, creation of gold / Yuan oil future, creation of the Shanghai Gold Fix, massive stock piling of gold, adhesion to the IMF and inclusion of the Yuan in the SDR basket etc.
Gold, Yuan, SDR and Bitcoin are the four top contestant to take over the role of global reserve currency. There is no way China would give up its key strategic position on Bitcoin when everything else shows that they have been restlessly pushing the CNY and increasing their control over gold and the SDR. 
More likely, the fact Bitcoin mining is on that list is just the result of different agencies making their own agenda independently. Or it could be deliberate bluff.

Indeed. Protesting is counterproductive because it reinforces the legitimacy of whatever one protests again. Withdrawing one's consent to be governed and opting out of the system every time an opportunity to do so presents iself is a much more effective way to make the current system go away than trying to beat it at its own rigged game. Stop voting, stop using the legacy banking system whenever possible, stop listening to mainstream media, and dare standing by your principles in society and calling a spade a spade and you'll do so much more damage to the system than you could ever do by protesting in the street.

Hitler put an end to the Weimar Republic and starter the Third Reich within two months of being appointed Chancellor. You can hardly say that he has much to do at all with the period and the economic collapse that happened at that time and either way, even if he did somehow manage to become retrospectively representative of a period he played no notable role in, that still wouldn't Godwin the thread since nobody compared anything or anyone to Hitler or Nazi germany which is the essence of Godwin's Law ("As a discussion on the Internet grows longer, the likelihood of a **comparison of a person's being compared to Hitler or another Nazi reference** increases").


That's precisely what you could say about the Fed's successive rounds of quantitative easing though.
I don't otherwise disagree with your views on the period, but remember that you have the benefit of hindsight and that in hindsight causality is always much more obvious than it was for an observer back then. We truly have no way to predict with certainty what will happen once the US empire starts shrinking and the US dollar loses its status of global reserve and exchange currency. 50 years from now what people will have to say about the monetary policy of the US and the consequences it had will probably be as unflattering as your view on the Weimar's republic money printing madness.


I'm not saying that the Iranian government is smelling of roses. But whatever they did that justified the sanctions back then is just that: an excuse for the sanctions. The sanctions themselves and the fact they have been maintained to this day is but non-military way to incite regime change. Why do you think the US appointed themselves heroes of social justice in Iraq (2nd largest oil exporter), Iran (3nd largest oil exporter), Kuweit (5th largets oil exporter) and Venezuela (6th largest oil expoter) and not say .. in Somalia where it's a permanent civil war zone and population could use an invervention of the US to oust the warlords and install a proper democratic government? Right Somalia has got no oil...

Either you don't understand what Godwin law is, or you have very inaccurate notions of European history. Perhaps both. Or more likely you are just trolling.
Either way, Weimar republic is a good example of how even a powerful country can end up caught in a hyper-inflation spirale. This could (and likely will) happen to the US. As the US dollar loses its position as the default world reserve and exchange currency (which is already ongoing) and is gradually being replaced by CNY, EUR, SDR and gold futures the cheer amount of USD that will flow back into the US economy and flood the market will be too massive to be quenched by changes of monetary policy. Imagine a giant totally uncrontrollable QE starting at the top of an already fairly inflated equity and bond market...


If Iran and North Korea were not trading with China and Russia in defiance of US economic sanctions, they'd have collapsed already. That's the whole point. Economic sanctions are a tool explicitely intended to damage the economy of a country and cause suffering in the population in the hope that said population will uprise, overthrow their government and support the creation of a pro-US government.

Charges were dropped. Accuser admitted having filed phony charges. As you can see in the news Assange isn't being extradited to Sweden to face rape charges but sent straightaway to the US to face treason charges (absurdly given that he isn't even a US citizen)  and probably put in front of a firing squad after a farcically biaised trial.

We are living in the same reality, you just don't seem to understand it too well.
Did you notice people taking oaths before witnessing in court, being sworn in office, marrying? Why do you think people do that, and why do you think other people are more willing to trust them after they did that? Is it because it's somehow legally binding? Nope, there are contracts for that. Is it because people are religious? Nope, even atheists take oaths. It's a moral commitment. Something that binds people at a much higher, deeper and farther reaching level.
On a more casual level, did you notice that most people refrain from literring public areas even when there is no witness? Did you notice that most people are trying their best to keep their promises even when they could easily cheat and get away with it or made that promise to themselves and could break it easily with no apparent consequence? Did you notice that people tend to feel bad about lying, bitching about other people or hurting other people even when they manage to get away with it? Again, that's because people are morally commited to being good or at least decent human beings, and they know intuitively that breaking this commitment will hurt them at a this more abstract moral level where their conscience resides, and that this will in fact have consequences somewhere down the line by the very principle that some "weirdo" people like myself call "karma" but that's more commonly known as "what goes around comes around".
Moral commitments are binding. Not legally. Not always socially. But they are always binding spiritually. It doesn't matter if you make them in person with your hand on your heart or over the Internet while hiding behind a pseudonym. You are commited and bound all the same because you have yourself made that step and crossed that line that nobody forced you to cross, and that decision stays with you. You are your own witness, judge and executionner. There is no "final judgement" but an ongoing assessment by yourself, your peers and reality around you, and subtle consequences rippling invisibly from all of your actions, thoughts, statements, deeds. 
Let it sink in: you have pledged that you rest your case regarding Pizzagate and will take a part of the guilt and responsibility if you turn out to be wrong. You have even taken the extra cheesy and dramatic step of pledging your entire soul. That's how much you don't care. That was really stupid but you did it. Believe it or not, this is not going away. You will remember this conversation when the news of the network take down eventually break out and you realize that a known pedophile network has been allowed to continue their unspeakable deeds for many more years thanks to the collective willingness of the likes of you to look somewhere else, go along with the cover up and even actively support it by taking an active part in trolling and discrediting the movement that was trying to expose it. You will remember that you had the opportunity to research the matter for yourself and verify the facts and that given the gravity of the allegations it was your responsibility to do so before forming a judgement and acting on it, but you were too lazy or weak so you didn't and instead went for an easy piecemeal judgement that didn't require you to adjust your views about politics or the society your are living in. You will remember that people tried to tell you the affair isn't what the mainstream media make it look like, that the narritive has been heavily and deliberately spun, that this is a blatant coverup, that your action and that of your peers is hurting the movement that's trying to expose the network, and yet you just tried to shut them up and ridicule them. You know what that makes of you? An accomplice. That makes you guilty by association. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes on that day and have to deal with the knowledge that I share a part of responsibility in the cover up of one of the most horrible and evil crime one could possibly conceive.
Frankly I'm not expecting that any of this will make any sense to you at this point but since I have taken your pledge I owed you an explanation. You'll understand eventually.
I can tell from your Reddit handle that you probably don't have a great opinion of yourself. It's sad. I hope you find it in yourself to be less cynical and actually start to care. It's never too late to make amends.

ICO are horizontal inflation. Although they started with a valid and healthy purpose when they were used to fund truly innovative and legit crypto projects, they have indeed become a cancer. The ecosystem of ICO sites and platforms, coin flippers and exchanges has become accustomed to easy money and turned into ICO junkies constantly looking for their next fix. If no real ICO is coming, they'll talk random startups,  businesses, con artists and day dreamers into doing their own ICO regardless of whether their business model really stands to benefit from tokenization so that the ecosystem can keep doing more and more ICOs, pocket the commissions and bounties, and make a quick and easy profit by flipping the tokens when trading starts.
Now that governments have started cracking down on ICOs, there is a real risk of landing in jail for the sleazier teams that can't be bothered to hire a lawyer and come up with a clever legal setup. This will significantly improve the signal/noise ratio by weeding out the amateurs.
At last we can stop spreading the capital thin like butter on a toast, and start growing the ecosystem vertically again by supporting the true unicorns among the projects that have already been funded. We can also stop living in a permanent state of information overload and FOMO im search of that one truly groundbreaking project potentially hidden in the midsts of mountains of garbage ICOs.

Obviously it's always possible to split but sometime the benefit of staying with the majority far outweighs the benefit of continuing on your own on your minority chain even if that means you have to let go some of your requirements.
This is a voluntary decision. I'm not saying that core devs must comply. I'm merely saying that the way things have been setup, a majority of  economic actors and miners are commited to uphold the NY agreement and if they have any integrity should and will uphold it. In all likelihood both the economic and miners majority is going to decide that Bitcoin is the 2x chain. I don't like that outcome but I understand politics and I am afraid that this seems to be where the new shelling point is forming whether we like it or not.
So the question is whether the core dev team wants to act like uncompromising and inflexible nerd, lose control of Bitcoin and end up maintaining an alt-coin. Or if they can swallow their pride and accept the tradeoff that they got Segwit but had to accept 2MB blocks. If they do the current core client, which is the reference implementation used by nearly everybody and controlled by core devs, will be compatible with 2x so the corporate interests who came up with the NY agreement will fail to usurp the technical leadership in the community as their client and repo will not replace the core client as the new reference implementation.
The only way to defeat the coup that  2x was designed to cause is for core to embrace 2x.

I'm not saying that the USD isn't signficantly more widely accepted than USDT. After all  the US government has got a whole lot more guns than Brock Pierce and his scamster friends.
What I'm saying is that the way the USD is created is exactly the same as USDT: it's created out of thin air, so what Brock Pierce is doing with USDT is ironically quite fitting to the name of his token: a worthless fractional reserve based unit of account backed by mere faith into its (untrustworthy) issuer.


The USD that was first minted in 1785 was an interely different currency backed by precious metals. The worthless paper currency we are using today was created in 1971. The fact the name was kept the same is a typical case of bait and switch.

Again, for the Nth time, this isn't a "crash", this is Kraken going off-line so that they can front-run the price movement quietly by taking all the buy liquidity and buying back from the last few long margin calls on the way down. 
Kraken and Bitfinex are known for being doing that as a (most profitable) side business. MtGox was doing that too before them. If you wish to be able to place orders / cancel your orders during a crash, do not use Kraken and Bitfinex. It will *always* be like that. The profit to be made front running a crash is simply too high to pass on for these exchanges.

You seem to think the corporates who are pushing for 2x actually want 2MB blocks. They don't. Nobody ever actually wanted larger blocks. The reason why the other side is using larger blocks as an excuse to oppose to core is that this is **the** feature the core dev team refuses to allow. That's why the other camp went as far as spamming the network using bots to "prove" their point that larger blocks are needed.
The point of the Bitmain failed coup and subsequent fork was not to increase block size but prevent the activation of Segwit that in incompatible with the AsicBoost hack in Bitmain ASICs.
The point of the upcoming "NY agreement" coup is not to increase the blocksize but to usurp leadership on developments and control of the reference implementation. If core doesn't follow and the majority adopts this fork, the new reference implementation will become the 2x one and core will be left out.


It's not about having a belief. It's about being incapable to compromise even when success depends on it. I know, for being one, that experienced developers tend to be very stubborn, perfectionist and get so engrossed by the pursuit of technical awesomeness that they often miss the big picture: sometime you just want something to be good enough for everyone .


Be my guest. I entirely agree with you. 2X people are just your typical scheming, unethical, power hungry, self-serving politicians.


All the parties to the NY agreement will all start considering Bitcoin to be 2x come November. And this includes Coinbase and by extension its sizeable share of the American market. There is no way to tell for sure whether or not they effectively represent the strict economic majority but it's almost anecdotic because either way they represent enough of it to create a major split and make it stick as a serious contender to the title of "Bitcoin". Even if the core chain prevails eventually, this will still create a giant confusion and damage severely Bitcoin's image in the public eye. The risk is very real. What is delusional isn't pointing to the very real risk but acting as if it didn't exist.


Exactly my point. If Core aligns with 2x, the attempt by NY agreement CEOs to usurp leadership will fail, the political situation will revert to the usual status quo, we won't have a spit. The only negative consequence is that the blockchain will become more bloated and that some core developers will have to swallow their pride.
In the other hand, if core refuses to align, we will have a split with two claimants to the title of "Bitcoin", both with significant claims and support. One will be the core Bitcoin run by the same folks as we have now, and the other one will be a corporate cartel coin with a lot of capital, political clout, corporate interests and main stream media cronyism on their side.
Of the two, the second alternative is much much more risky and damaging to the ecosystem.


Communication != information. There is no trust. We don't know who bluffs and who doesn't. We don't know who will join which side in the end. All we can do is guess. Any outcome that is perceived by most participants as the likely point the majority of other participants will converge to hereby making it the point of optimum payout and therefore the best outcome to bet on, is a schelling point. And 2x is starting to look more and more like it.


This is not democracy where only the perspective of the majority is allowed to exist. Blockchain creates as many alternative chains as there are stable and incompatible views around which consensus forms. It doesn't mean anything to say that Core is "following the consensus". They necessarily follow A consensus amongst the MULTIPLE consensus that arise from disagreements with other development teams. And the consensus they have always been following so far is the one that arises from their very own ruleset. It would be an entirely different thing for Core to accept to revise their views and follow a consensus that formed around another ruleset than their own. So far this is unheard of and this is exactly what I am saying they will probably have to do this time if we want to avoid ending up with two chains.       
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:04:24


I agree but not for the same reason. Core should suddenly start embracing 2x for the reason that this will nip in the bud the attempted coup. If core is on with 2x, then they ... can't get rid of core anymore :). On the downside we will get 2MB blocks which aren't necessary, but that won't really hurt anyone.

Chinese investors who seek to evade capital controls look at their asset value from an international perspective.

Just have trade partners devaluate their currency at the same pace as you do, manipulate the price of gold, and bomb the shit out of non-compliant nations while calling them terrorists and blaming on them all the problems of the nation and the sharp drop of buying power.
It's been decades they are doing that successfully and the US dollar has already lost 97% of its value since it went off the gold standard, even using manipulated gold prices. That's a 4000% inflation, and would likely be a 10000% inflation had the gold market been allowed to really float freely.

Quote where I said that "everything is some big conspiracy to control the masses". We were talking about JP Morgan. Pulling the "conspiracy theorist" straw man when you run into someone making an argument that conflicts with your reductive vision of the world isn't very constructive.
There are three possible explanations for JP Morgan being recapitalised allegedly against its will
1) The same treasury that decided to let Lehman Brothers sink because it couldn't justify recapitalising it at tax payer expenses volunteered to spend $12B of tax payer money to bailout JP Morgan, a bank that wasn't even undercapitalized and didn't want their help.
2) JP Morgan was indeed undercapitalized and at risk, but its CEO refused a bailout **in breach of financial regulation that requires banks to maintain a minimum tiers one ratio** and at the risk of letting his company blow up.
3) JP Morgan was undercapitalized and willing to be bailed out, but to avoid panicking even further a market that was already on the verge of a complete melt down, the Treasury and the Fed decided that it was preferable to present the bailout under a different narrative that would be more palatable.
Since you are a fine critical thinker, you must know Occam's Razor. So tell me which of these explanation is the most credible?

Regulations regulate activities, not specific people. No regulation will ever point the finger specifically to a given type of business and have wording such as "banning Bitcoin exchanges". Regulations will outlaw or require licensing for specific types of trades. Here it's the exchange of crypto for fiat that is becoming regulated. That means that it will be as illegal to perform that activity as an exchange, or as a small individual trader.

It's been a long time Bitcoin has ceased being an effective mean of payment and is being mostly used as store of value and capital on/off ramp for altcoin trading. This may change again once Lightning is fully operational and start gaining adoption, but we are still years away of Bitcoin having a stable price and being widely used in commerce.

The US government doesn't print USD. The Fed and member banks do. And technically, as far as creating it out of thin air goes, what Tether and the Fed are doing is exactly the same thing. The only difference is that all it will take to make the Tether fractional reserve scam collapse is a run on the bank or a forced audit of their reserves whereas the Fed scam is done in plain sight and officially endorsed by the US government, so that it's allowed to perpetuate ad infinitum at the expense of the entire world economy.

It doesn't matter who has the majority of the hashpower. The point is that there will be enough hash power on either side to keep both chains alive. It will be a little bit bumpy at first, but things will be back to normal once there is a retarget. Once both chains are functionning normally from a user point of view, the chain that has got the most user support (Bitcoin), the strongest economy (Bitcoin), and/or the most legitimacy (Bitcoin again) will retain most of the market cap. Eventually, hashpower will rebalance according to profitability and the majority of miners who were forced to mine 2X due to the fact they signed the NYA will have to revert to Bitcoin or sink with the boat.
The bottom line is that 2X will just be another bump on the road, quickly left behind and quickly forgotten. You can't make users to care about 2X just by having more hashpower. As long as Bitcoin remains functional, nothing will disrupt it. I'm most curious about what the anti-bitcoiners will find next.

If it's not, how do you explain that exchanges, for whom exchanging crypto for fiat is the main activity, are closing?


It depends what regulation they are referring to. If it's a new regulation that explicitly says that exchanging fiat for crypto is illegal (don't forget China is a pretty authoritarian country), then yes that means that it becomes illegal to sell Bitcoin for fiat, which by extension makes it impossible to buy Bitcoin without the other party doing something illegal. Now if the regulation is only about getting a license, or is just identifying Bitcoin as an existing class of regulated asset requiring certain additional formalisms to be respected, then it wouldn't be entirely illegal to buy Bitcoin. But then exchanges wouldn't be closing...

Chinese investors who seek to evade capital controls look at their asset value from an international perspective.

It's like the 6th or so time it does exactly that, and 100+th time mainstream media declare it's dead, the 100+th time some banker calls it a fraud, and the 3rd or 4th time China threatens to ban it and does a lot of handwaving to show off its awesome power all the while being entirely incapable or effectively even willing to actually banning it...

I second this. First we need to introduce stake based voting to ensure that the economic majority approves a change of PoW. Then we should move to a new PoW with the clearly advertized policy that we will do it again should miners deviate again from the will of the economic majority. This will teach miners to stick to their job of securing the network instead of trying to take control of the ecosystem.

Knowing that chinese media are goverment censored != knowing how the censorship works exactly... For example, you assume every piece that's posted is being reviewed first. Unless you have a detailed understanding of Chinese policy, you can't possibly be knowing that. It's amazingly costly and slow to have every piece of news being reviewed before it's posted on a media website. It's much easier and nearly as effective to let things being posted, and ask the media outlets to take the article down if a particular piece is controversial. In which case your claim that the article is "as good as official" is misguided.

Clients don't "connect to a blockchain". They are either generic nodes or SPVs. Generic nodes connect to other nodes on the overlay network, and will receive all the blocks from both chains since both will be using the same overlay network. Since generic nodes verify transactions they won't be fooled and will discard 2X garbage. SPV clients that connect to a trusted node will rely on the judgement of the trusted node, and go along with Bitcoin or 2X depending on which version their trusted node supports. Only SPV clients that use the chain with the most computing will get confused and switch between the two chains to follow the one with the most PoW done.

The bad faith behind this bill is baffling. This bill pretends to criminalize large cash transactions under the absurd claim that crime status and 2-year jail threat will dissuade illegal black market activity but illegal black market activities are already criminal for the most part and already come with jail penalties far greater than 2-year. If you are trafficking drug or doing murder for hire and you are caught, you have bigger concerns to worry about than the fact you infringed on the cash ban.
This ban is hardly going to change the risk level for actual criminals. This is meant to scare normal people away from cash transactions, not criminals.

That's what the propaganda in your economics class manual is conditionning you to believe. Look at your premises: why do people have to spend? To boost the economy. Why do we need to boost the economy? So that companies make more money. Why do we need the companies to make more money: so that they can increase the value of theirs shares (if shares were a currency, they would be deflationary: more about that soon) and hire more people doing full time jobs and pay higher salaries. Why do people need higher salaries? So that ... they can consume more.
So basically we need people to consume more so that there is enough demand to occupy them full time so that they may maximize their income so that they can consume more. Meanwhile we are destroying the environment and wasting our lives. And the most ironic thing is that the upper class invests its savings in stocks ... which value is constantly growing thanks to the inflationnary monetary policy ... which encourages them to keep their capital in the stock market instead of consuming.
In other words, inflation is meant to force the lower and middle class to slave on and consume so that the 1% can become richer thanks to its neatly deflationnary equity investments.

@_date: 2016-05-06 09:51:20
You didn't define what is "it" in "will you believe it".
If you are asking if I would believe that the statement was signed by a key originally created by Satoshi, sure I would as this is what crypto allows me to verify.
If you are asking if I would believe that it is Satoshi or someone he/she/they trusted enough to give the private key to, I would say yes as Satoshi being a persona needs not really be a single person or an entity fixed in shape over time. If the original Satoshi allows more people in the secret over time these people become Satoshi too until we are all Satoshi.
Now if you are asking if I would believe the statement to be true just because it was signed by Satoshi, the answer would be no. I have no reason to think Satoshi would necessarily tell the truth. Now given your specific statememt, if I can establish the endorsement of the statement both ways i.e. Satoshi claiming to be Donald Trump and Donald Trump claiming to be Satoshi, I would believe that indeed from now Donald Trump is indeed Satoshi either originally or through a bilateral agreement to transfer the persona to Trump.
But how does that relate to my post?

Excellent post that puts the right words on the problem. Nobody "accuses" Gavin of anything.

There is a strong connection between R3 and Craig Wright, both directly throuh Ian Grigg who is a close friend of Wright and architect at R3 and was  actively involved in the hoax, and indirectly through Mike Hearn, a core developer at R3 and a crony of Gavin Andresen.
The timing of R3's fundraiser just after what was supposed to be a glorious return of the master is also uncanny.
Sounds like a very weird coincidence. I wonder if R3 had bragged to banks that they had the support of Satoshi himself. That would explain why banks would suddenly backpedal over a measly 200M funding request when they found out that they had been taken for a ride.

Gavin claimed that what convinved him beyond doubt was that Wright signed a message using the same private keys that were used to sign block 1 and block 9. Either Wright has access to the private keys and then he can prove it publicly, or he doesn't and then whatever Gavin supposedly saw was staged.
There is no need to drag David Kleiman in that story.

I haven't made any connection or derived any conclusion so not sure what theory you are referring to. Just stated some pattern I saw between people who endorsed publicly Wright's Satoshi claim.
That being said if there was any sort of organized effort to try to attack Bitcoin, it would certainly make sense for the attacker to have pawns in both camps.


Not aware of him. What is supposed to be the connection?


Did Wladimir also endorse Wright? If not he is not relevant to what I was talking about here.


I think OP's theory is not about it being a conspiracy of big blockers. The way I understand it is that he suggests that the schism around the blocksize was engineered to divide the community in which case they (whoever it is) surely would need pawns in both camps...
I'm not taking a position on that (sincerely I don't know) but given the type of deception games that we know have happened in the past including the whole enigma story that lasted years and was kept secret for decades and a good number of high profile false flags some of which are still being boiling-frog'ed away, and given how astroturfing has become the new trendy game in town to influence public opinions (see the HB Gary leak), an engineered divide of the Bitcoin community is a perfectly plausible theory IMO.
Either way, just sharing the pattern that I saw. If OP or someone else wants to dig around these connections he may (or may not) find interesting stuff.

And trust managers in the 21st century write using 19th century typewritters and treat clients with 500M USD of assets under management with cold contempt, refusing to make appointments. 
And the trustee will let you sign with private keys twice (for Gavin and Jon Matonis) but not a third time because this would affect the trust assets (it's well known that private keys are subject to wear and tear). And Wright being so honnest will of course have religiously shredded the keys after each demonstration and had to ask for a new copy to the trustee each time instead of simply keeping the keys of block 1 and 9 handy.
Not to mention the decision to handover control of the complete Satoshi holding to a centralized fiduciary institution when the whole point of Bitcoin was to avoid that.

They seem absurdly content to let their reputation burn in flame. This is the most bizarre thing of the whole story.
Don't take my word. Just look at their reaction since the story started. And ask yourself if they knew or not what kind of shitstorm was coming. This should be enough to make you understand that there is much more (whatever it is) to that story than it would seem.
This is not to say you shouldn't follow the story anyway and pick the clues etc. What I'm really saying is that a lot of what you will uncover was planted there for you to find and the real purpose of the whole thing for whoever composed that act is likely not what it is explicitely claimed to be.

Read JVP's interview by Bitcoin Magazine and Grigg's blog: they are both copiously embroidering on top of the story. Grigg plays it more human drama with details about how the "Team Satoshi" has been hiding and living in fear and torn apart by the pressure and the death of Kleiman. JVP plays it more mystery, riddles and secret society. And Uyen Nguyen is the youngster on the verge of a nervous breakdown who will spill the beans in next expisode.

There is evidence of Gavin endorsing publicly a known hoaxer and supporting his (so far) baseless and (apparently) fraudulent new claims.

Gavin's integrity and/or competence as a core developer is and will remain in question until further proof is provided that he didn't misreport alleged verification of cryptographic proof that CSW controls the private keys of block 1 and 9. 
Note also that in spite of the recent events Gavin has reinstated his endorsement and CSW has claimed he will provide further proof. There is therefore no harm to wait until sufficient evidence is provided to clear Gavin's name.

@_date: 2016-05-05 19:07:37
This is complete horseshit. Gavin reported that Wright was in control of the keys that were used to sign blocks 1 and 9. Either this is true and Wright can do the same thing once again and be done and not move a single coin and not move a single trust asset. Or the demonstration to  Gavin and Jon Matonis was a sham in which case current Satoshi claim holds no water at all and can be dismissed as yet another hoax. Again for the N+1 time **sign an identification message with they keys that were used to sign  blocks 1 and 9 as was allegedly done in front of Gavin and Jon Matonis or GTFO**. Keeping on making more and more increasingly cheesy claims and dragging in the story more and more gullible or dishonnest cronies won't do **anything** to change your hand. This is not poker. If you can't reproduce what Gavin reported that he witnessed we are not interested in your story.

I think he **is** the real person after whom the Satoshi persona was named. The coincidence of having a Satoshi Nakamoto living 2 blocks away from Hal Finney's home is just too improbable to be ignored.
Hal and his cypherpunk counterparts intended for this old friendly retired man whose house had been foreclosed by banksters to be the symbolic figure behind the financial renaissance on behalf of all the victims of the modern financial system. Satoshi is Dorian and I think it's just fine that way.

Exactly. This is absurd. Gavin knew what he was doing. He hasn't even withdrawn his earlier endorsement. I'd venture to say that things turning this way was probably the plan all along. No idea what was the real goal of all this drama but we shall understand it in hindsight someday.
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:46:18
Bad judgement doesn't stop there. Gavin picked a turn-coat as trusted associate when starting Bitcoin XT (Mike Hearn, now working for banksters at R3 and actively trying to undermine Bitcoin), endorsed a known con artist in his attempt to con the entire Bitcoin community (Craig Wright also strongly connected with R3 via Ian Grigg), and got hired by MIT MediaLabs (also behind the very controversial and borderline evil ChainAnchor). Meanwhile he hasn't contributed anything of actual significance to Bitcoin in years.

I'm the OP. There is nothing in what I posted that implies that CSW is actually Satoshi or that I think that he should be as a form of reverse psychology.
If you take the time to read again what I am saying is that **what we are going through is an act**. We are being taken for a ride. It is a programmed shitstorm that Gavin, Grigg and Matonis were fully aware of. This is the only explanation I can see for their  zen attitude while they are watching their reputation burn in flames without moving a finger to do damage control.
Now the question is why would they do that? Why all the obvious 419 scam level nonsense? Why the career suicide?
That's what i am trying to figure. I don't pretend to have the final explanation, but this reminds me very much of the [bizarre career suicide of Truecrypt]( where the core developers litterally discredited themselves and started criticizing the project because they couldn't reveal that they were under a gag order and national security letter and forced to implement backdoors by some three letter agency to make Truecrypt unsecure.
If Gavin had been compromised and risked being prosecuted for treason for revealing it, what would be his options other than litterally shooting himself in the foot for an apparently unrelated reason? 
I'm not claiming this is the case here. But that's an hypothesis that could explain some of what we are seing. Either way, I believe that the truth is much more subtle than what it seems to be and we should start reading between the lines instead of going first degree and mobbing around this bizarre absurd and strangely insistant hoax.

Early blocks carry more value than their balance since they can allow to impersonnate Satoshi.

Yet another cheesy, useless and self-congratulating blog post which just makes the whole drama even sillier.
Gavin reported that Wright demonstrated control of the keys that were used to sign blocks 1 and 9. Either this was staged and then Gavin's testimony is worthless and the whole affair a complete sham, or this was real in which case Wright controls the keys and can prove it. Until proof is given, we have to and will assume that the whole story is likely a fraud and the longer it will linger and the more unconclusive gesticulations from Wright, Grigg &amp; co there will be, the more naturally inclined we will be to consider this is indeed a fraud.

Gavin's commit access was removed because something about Gavin's ability to perform as a rational, analytical, upstanding and competent core developer appears to have been compromised and lead to the posting of this absurd endorsement on his blog. Assuming that it was his system that had been compromised was the only fair and proper inital assumption to make and the only diplomatic and respectful way of announcing publicly the revocation of his write access before starting to question his competence and/or integrity. But doubt remains and Gavin will have a lot of explaining to do to gain back the trust of other core developers.
Compare this to a C-level officer of a company found to have publicly endorsed a fraud. Even if every element points to his good faith, he will still in the most favorable case be suspended from duty temporarily until investigation is complete and his name has been cleared. Doing otherwise would be irresponsible and carry enormous systemic risk for the firm.

The fact Gavin, a core developer with years of experience maintaining a **trustless** cryptographic ledger decided to give a public and categorical endorsement of Wright being Satoshi based on very shaky evidence produced in a non-trustless manner shows very poor judgement on his part. It shows many damning things:  
1) Gavin appears to think that legitimacy can be authenticated by appealing to authority hence his intervention to **endorse** Wright. Andreas Antonopuloulos saw it and refused to even sign the NDA as the whole idea of relying on appeal-to-authority is contrary to the very nature of decentralized trust, something the real Satoshi would definitely understand. But Gavin didn't.  
2) Gavin failed to realize that the execution environment in which the demonstration was performed was not neutral and could have been compromised in multiple ways although this was trivially obvious.  
3) Gavin failed to grasp the subjective and logically unsound nature of his own conclusion and published it as a fact without any "caveat emptor" and any word of warning regarding particular limitations of the authentication process.  
4) Gavin failed to wait for publication of an effective public proof before publishing his endorsement.  
5) Gavin still doesn't appear to have fully realized the above points and still hasn't withdrawn his endorsement in spite of its logical unsoundness and the systemtic risk it exposes Bitcoin to.  
The fact that Gavin, a core developer supposedly expert of trustless authentication, failed to perform proper authentication and even failed to realize it puts seriously into question his competence and/or his integrity. 
Under such circumstances revoking his direct access to the repo was and still is the right thing to do. This doesn't mean that Gavin shouldn't be allowed to contribute to the code. Gavin can still submit pull requests. What this means is that, like every other non-whitelisted contributors, Gavin's contributions should undergo careful peer review **before** they are commited to the master.

He has been remarkably good at that so far actually.

It's pretty ironic that the guy isn't a USA resident or a USA citizen nor did he run his business in USA, yet he got extradited to the USA for a crime defined in USA laws (which shouldn't apply to him) and prosecuted in the USA. This is crazy.

Your employer doesn't "lose money". It exchanges one asset (money) for another asset (labor) just like the counterparty of any market transactions be it Bitcoin, gold or whatever.
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:10:44
Well when they report about alleged criminals they don't forget to put "alleged" as they are aware that judging someone's involvement in something is a difficult and unreliable process that usually requires the help of a court of law and a bunch of experts and witnesses and may still end up being inconclusive or even giving invalid conclusions. They are also aware of the risk of libel litigations should they unfairly misreport charges.
The same prudence in reporting was needed here but wasn't applied probably due in part to FOMO on the scoop that led to rushed publication. Wikileaks is right, this is a massive fail for these news outlet's credibility.

There are some interesting triangular relationships between people who endorsed Craig Wright's latest Satoshi claim. I'll just drop that here.
**Ian Grigg**  
Ian Grigg is a friend and supporter of Craig Wright  
Ian Grigg supports publicly the claim that [Craig Wright is Satoshi](  
Ian Grigg [works for R3CEV]( a banking consortium formed around the goal of creating a global financial distributed ledger controlled by banks.  
**Mike Hearn**  
Mike Hearn [works for R3CEV](  
Mike Hearn is the co-inceptor with Gavin Andresen of Bitcoin XT, the first fork of Bitcoin Core by the big blockers community.  
Mike Hearn is an outspoken critic of Core and recently even an [outspoken critic of Bitcoin in general](  
**Gavin Andresen**  
Gavin Andresen supports publicly the claim that [Craig Wright is Satoshi](  
Gavin Andresen is the co-inceptor with Mike Hearn of Bitcoin XT, the first fork of Bitcoin Core by the big blockers community.  
Gavin Andresen is the [Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation]( a controversial self-appointed influence group claiming to represent Bitcoin.  
Gavin Andresen is currently [employed by MIT Media Labs](  
**MIT MediaLabs**  
MIT MediaLabs is the initiator and host of ChainAnchor, a research project aiming at allowing the extension of KYC/AML to public permissionless blockchains, that is [currently sparking controversy]( due to the leak of a former whitepaper that describes its application to Bitcoin and involves a bribing mecanism for miners.  
**Jon Matonis**  
Jon Matonis is a [founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation](  
Jon Matonis supports publicly the claim that [Craig Wright is Satoshi](  
TL;DR: there are interesting crossovers between MIT, R3CEV, The Bitcoin Foundation, and Bitcoin XT/Classic around the same people who publicly endorsed Craig Wright's latest Satoshi claim and are also somewhat connected to each other.
Disclaimer: remember however that correlation doesn't imply causation.

Exactly. It's fine to research attack vectors. Hal Finney did it and it helped make Bitcoin stronger. The security by obscurity model is bound to fail anyway. If Bitcoin can't evolve to counter this attack it is as good as dead eventually.
What is not fine at all on the other hand is to act in denial, lie shamelessly and troll people who are asking questions. It's really a shame that it's what MIT has been doing so far.

The original paper is signed Satoshi Nakamoto. You can't modify the paper while keeping it under the original author's name as this would be forgery. You can do a rewrite of the paper under you own name but then this isn't the Bitcoin whitepaper anymore and pretending it is would again be forgery.

It's intentional. Kraken and Bitfinex are doing the same. MtGox was a big fan of the practice too back in the days.

This isn't the first time Gavin is involved in questionable matters: meeting with CIA, participation to XT with Mike Hern who later went on to develop permissioned blockchains for R3CEV and their bank overlords, trying to take over Bitcoin by leveraging on FUD around block size matters to sell his own fork, currently funded by MIT Digital Currency Initiative who also authored the very controversial ChainAnchor, and now he is caught red handed endorsing an impostor who pretends to be Satoshi.
If Gavin was not hacked, then Occam Razor's next best explanation to his current highly suspicious involvement is that he is a mole planted to disrupt Bitcoin. 
IMO at this point and with all the dubious affiliations there is enough doubt on Gavin's real motivation to justify a permanent revocation of his Bitcoin repo commit access rights. Of course he can still contribute by submitting pull requests.
