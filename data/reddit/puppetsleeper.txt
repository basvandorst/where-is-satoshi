So use  one of those other fiat to crypto exchanges available to you that aren't completely swamped right now...
Yes it sucks, not it's not really good enough, perhaps they should have closed new registrations giving time to scale up, but the bottom line is for many people it's the risk they have to take if they want to get money into crypto now rather than whenever an actually decent alternative comes along.

So many scams like this all over crypto. Gotta use bookmarks. Adblockers too I suppose.

He could, but why would he care? It's not his mandate to avoid detrimentally affecting the bitcoin market.

Yet presumably they are absolutely fine with people walking into a betting shop, and putting money onto absolutely any ridiculous bet that the bookies will accept? If they don't think people are smart enough to manage their debt then they shouldn't be offering credit at all.

What's the difference between not being able to pay back a holiday paid for on a credit card and crypto paid for on a credit card? If someones a bad credit risk, then they shouldn't extend credit to them, not try to restrict what it's going to be spent on.
"Idiot kids" who'd spunk money away on crypto shouldn't be given any credit, not just not credit for crypto surely?
