Even if he sold only one, he netted $17k profit. Quit fronting and pretending that's chump change.

Pure ideology is cancer. Ideology is the reason that Segwit isn't even 100% adopted. And that's a pretty basic upgrade that most anyone should be able to agree on. Bitcoin is running on a principle of forced burdens right now, basically refusing to grow up and adapt.

Decimal points &gt; commas for fractions. I've never understood it. Commas already have a place in arithmetic.

CoinMarketCap sucks though. Their pairing is always like 5% off (or more).

*Financial advisor* FTFY.
An accountant is like a money manager that is authorized to act in your stead, financially. A financial advisor advises. You don't want an accountant.

I was being funny. It really is a kick in the head for all kinds of traders.

It won't.

I bought in Bitcoin around $800 so haven't lost anything whatsoever there lol. Alts though....I lost a fair amount.

Even the longest term hodlers have only seen one major crash. Over 85% of BTC's life has been mainly flat and unimpressive. For real. (Some of us have been here for a while and it was never volatile because it wasn't profitable because it was totally underground and barely used).

Bull altcoin market? I don't know about that. The only alt that's been worth holding recently is Ethereum from what I see. All of my alts are pretty stagnant.

So....dumb it down a shade for me. What's your point?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:08:56
If you held from 2014 to now, you mainly have seen a flat market. So the whole bravado against new investors is nauseating at best. Stop pretending that ANY of this is just to be expected. Bitcoin is changing drastically and is 100% unrecognizable from just last year. Grow up and stop playing big on the internet.

I was mainly talking about the fees that are supposedly up to 125% larger than the entire transaction. All the horror stories that were posted ad nauseum while the drop from 19 to 10 was happening. A lot of it was fake stuff. Sorry to rustle them jimmies yall.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:06:41
$200 1 input, 1 output.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:06:02


Or hodling since 2014 with no need to do any transactions so I never saw any fees or the mempool. Same diff I guess ��

This is gonna happen again before the end of the weekend......

Quote from myself. I never said it was good or acceptable. Just not very much worse than a lot of other methods and undeserving of the negative press.

Ripple is the Federal Reserve yall. No thanks.

It was sent from a Trezor at 544 sat/B. I totally regret saying anything now. I don't really dig the whole giving out addresses and tx and all to randos on the internet. Public blockchain is invaluable for people doing trade. Not pointless talk on social media. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:48:01
Way to shit on the Bitcoin community and college students at the same time. You're the reason that financial aid treats people like they're trying to sell drugs with student loan money, and had you failed it would have been all over the news and made Bitcoin look shitty. It's pretty scummy actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:52:27
Sounds like he is incentivizing the HODL game to me. Don't trade. Only buy.

Yeah I've seen your comment history around here. If you hustled as hard as you hate, you might have too much money to worry about how other people invest theirs. I hope you find something that works for you. And if you do, I double hope that some rando doesn't come along to shit all over it for no reason.

It's exaggerated and ultimately more attributable to operator error.

Good thing you aren't the sole arbiter of currency and universal symbols of recognition. Conversion to units of fiat are never going away, like it or lump it. I love watching people pretend that fiat is literally worthless. Grow up.

Australia has a higher number of uninsured per capita vs. the United States. But if we're talking about quality of services, people travel from all over the world to go to medical school or hospital residency here.


No. We can turn right on red. You're on the wrong side dummy.


The entire country was mapped in and built to the standard mile. It's too late to change now. 


Apple is a multinational conglomerate at best. That would be like calling PepsiCo uniquely American. It is not.


Totally irrelevant to the issue of freedom and greatness of the entire country as a whole. More Americans have Androids anyway.


Again, completely irrelevant. So did the Egyptians. So did the Ottomans. Empires/nations fall. America may well itself one day, but if it does, China goes too. Who's gonna buy all their products? Australia? ��


There is. It is essentially the stock markets of the world and the global marketplace. And it takes 1.3 AUD to buy 1 USD. I think we're winning the money game...mate.

Get the fuck over yourself. We control the money, not the other way around. I have zero loyalty to any currency, I have loyalty to people. If an EMP happens and we're back to sticks and stones, are you gonna bitch about what is traded for goods? Cause I'm not. I'm gonna work with the tools that are there. I'll say it again; all currency matters. Get more. All kinds. And fuck off while you're doing it ��

Nah. "Day/Month/Year" format is the confusing (wrong) one.

I agree. I will definitely cross that bridge when I get there.

Buying BTC with USD gives the dollar more purchasing power when the value of BTC rises, rather than just using the dollars. Either way you're "getting more out of your dollar" when it's in BTC form, whether it's purchasing or selling off when the value hit crazy peaks.

I wish. My income isn't quite like that. I've got a little savings and I'm going to school so I get fairly average FA disbursements every 6 months. But I agree, I'd like to get a little more in before it hits 5000 lol.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:19:09
I've heard plenty about Coinbase, good and bad. The idea of moving from the wallet on a huge exchange to a private wallet like Mycelium seems like a bit too many fees for such a new buy in though. For right now anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:25:12
To put it quite simply; "to maximize the efficiency of my dollar". Dollar transactions are mainly electronic anyway and there's a heavy amount of time and fees and interest involved in almost everything with $$. BTC is clearly better. I've been dragging my feet on it since 2013. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:45:28
Are we using the word "crash" now? I thought it was a "healthy correction".
