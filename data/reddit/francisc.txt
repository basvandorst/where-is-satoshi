First time I've heard of onename.com. Thanks for the suggestions!

Perhaps I'm being overly-paranoid.

Right. But I was thinking there might be a "layered" option. Like you could have a service that publicly shows a set address, but then that forwards the BTC to an address that's not publicly listed. An address and private key that I could change whenever I like.

Why does anyone listen to this nitwit?

I just tried buying from them a few minutes ago. Got a weird error message saying something like 'Coinbase has reached the maximum number of bitcoin purchases for the moment. Please try again later.'
Are they limited by the number of orders they can make on any given day?

This comment really helped me out. 
I was trying to buy 2 BTC, it never worked.
I tried 1 BTC and the order went through right away.

I see. 
Would be nice if they posted those stats on their site.

Ah, OK. Sounds like it's more geared towards business accounts.
