Can someone give a transcript of what he says?

Keep scrolling. It requires u to make an account in 10 secs.

Oh thank you so much! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:20:35
No one here. People are in because the value appreciates. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:38:05
Dude, this is me exactly. Luckily she's open minded and willing to listen and learn.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:23:30
Eff that website. Forces you to signup to read.

What are the top ten cryptocurrencies?

How do you change your fees?
When I buy or sell bitcoin, there's no option to set your own fee.

How exactly does this testing help?
I'm lost after I get it running on my linux.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:16:56
I would love that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:17:53
Balances just shows how much BTC u have.

Original was better to be thought an idiot than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.

What do you mean manually? I haven't used blockfolio, but from his description it's pretty self explanatory and it does calculate automatically.
Or are you talking about an exchange?

What happens if you lose this?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:15:47
Would be nice if there was a good chat option.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:51:48
I don't think that you understand that BTC is like the gold standard. Every exchange uses BTC.

Haven't tried Bitfinex, but Poloniex sucks. There's no portfolio telling you your gains.
Also you can't trade IOTA on there.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:32:45
Think about what?
Too much power in their hands?
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:28:23
But BTC ceiling is higher. There's no way Monero will even be close to BTC's worth. But either way, you should buy both.

Or extremely small layer of management and able to make decisions quickly?
