It had to when wallet is created. Then gives options to recieve segwit. Last time i posted about this a guy checked the transactions and one was sent from segwit and one from normal address. 
There is no option to send all from segwit as it would be expected instead of just generating recieving segwit only. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:52:25
Never used a normal address. When opening the wallet to setup doesnt give an option of segwit or normal. Then in settings to recieve it says recieve to segwit address. Ive always sent to segwit and when i sent out for bills thats what i happened. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:03:38
This shouldnt even be an option given the fees today and advertising as a segwit wallet. What other settings will increase fees?

213000 bitcoins. Numbers maybe off but in report

Yes well purchasing it to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:16
Yes took over exchange and claimed they were against the govt and taxes. Hit polish news. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:24
Because paying a $10 bill online and paying  $15 in fees makes bitcoin not a functional currency. This drives down the people wanting to purchase it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:02:16
This is a problem even if stopped. Other reports saying its an exchange

Sticky  And you should have been watching and sold
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:31:48
Yeah on bitcoin talk somewhere 
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:16:49
Yeah I have it on mobile and while there's a place in settings for displaying usd it doesn't display it for the wallet itself. Tried everything with it. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:47:31
My example is completely relevant. I have a $20 bill, pay $22 with processor and end up paying over $25 by the time Im done with it on Jaxx.
I had a $13 bill with fees with $14 in an electrum wallet and paid it just fine. 
The spendable limit before miner fees are even chosen is a rip off. why should i have more then needed in that wallet just to make a payment and have to send more to it to satisfy a payment? Now I have $3 in the wallet I didnt even need there. but the spendable limit is requiring me to have it there.
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:44:18
I have electrum. I just dont like how it doesnt display the amount in USD and only bitcoin. Ill check the others thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:44:16
about 5 mins apart. I was online paying some bills and maybe 5 mins difference in time. Thats why I was transferring what i needed per my bills and not over transferring. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:23:07
Again I stated the fees thru jaxx were higher and it's not the same with mycelium or electrum wallets. Seems your just wanting to circle jerk jaxx and the high fees they are charging for it. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:27:24
Not really. Fees with mycelium are not bad. 
Example. I had a $22 payment (including processor fee) to send. I had $25 in my jaxx. Jaxx wouldn't let me send and said I had a spendable of $22.40 in my account. The amount to send was below the amount available and the amount in my wallet but I had to deposit more into my account to sent it. So then I go to my alt coin wallet and send $7 from there with the built in shapeshift and receive  $3 in bitcoin added just to sent a $22 payment.... 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:51:08
I had a small bill to pay and transferred from an alt coin. Fees yesterday were about $4 I paid thru mycelium. So I transferred enough to pay the bill minus $5 fees
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:21:29
When I want to pay something for $20 it will cost $60? This is ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:25:11
Are other coins cheaper now? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:06:57
3% of profits and your stealing their name to sell shirts? I thought legally you had give more to do that.

Ok so why are you guys upset that he doesnt want to regulate it? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:15:18
There are many bitcoin plugins. Working ones another story.

I know a guy on my Facebook. Sells New York Life insurance and claims is a financial investor. Always talks about it and claims he knows everything and how it's a bad investment. Every time it goes down he starts about how he told everyone. Yet I had to shut him earlier when he was making fun of it. I told him at 200 when he said it was a bad investment then it's now 2k. Even if it dropped 800 it's still 1800 higher then when he was bitching it was a bad investment. 
Some people are too stupid to see the obvious. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:50:46
Lol I thought this when I saw his post

Not going into everything it's been 6 weeks + and I'm still not verified to level 2. On your site in Q&amp;A you give a spot admitting to long verification times. So it's not just saying to verify to level 2 when you can't even verify anyone in a reasonable amount of time.  
Here's a link showing amount and fees and still waiting over 6 weeks for verification
 
This transaction was a lesser percentage but same fees if 400pln or 800pln. And I still couldn't send over 800pln.
Thankfully Kraken verified me in 2 days and cheaper fees.
