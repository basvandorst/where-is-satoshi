For people who are just getting into btc now they are NO WAY dissapointed the only people dissapointed is the people who are broke and bought 80% OF the btc they own above $500USD and these same people for some reason beleive btc will never rise again.

Btc addresses can stay its what will be built over it, in lets say WALLETS , Im sure i saw some appS that do this already.. but either way people will have addresses and in your wallet app you can link theur names with the address like your phone contacts. Simple, there is need at alll to  change protocol for that reason. Imagine your phone book was just filled with numbers and  no names? It will change you just watch

Lol @ government? Reallly??? Think about it long and hard and do some research and you may realise thats not true. The government is not benefiting AT ALL by doing this,  they are just allowing more people to jump in at a lower price. All it is , is all the get rich quickers realising its not so quick and are all bailing afraid the price will get REAL low and then they are too late that 2nd mortage now needs to get paid. THIS is what made the price bubble in the first place and willy bot helped also, it was NEVER meant to be at 1k that early on i guarantee it will get to 1k but not as quick as some may think UNLESS a something sparks a massive buy frenzie because of some new killier app or because an fiat economy busts and every1 jumps into btc to get saved .. who knows if none of this then the price will plateau at around 200 and then slowly rise again and i mea  SLOWLY

Guys that 1200 price was a bubble dont you get it.. media hype + mt gox + silk road shutdown + senate anouncment .BITCOIN  itself is NOT a bubble ..but and here is a BIG BUT thats not to say there will not be any price bubbles. And i am afraid that last November was one.. but at each bubble we get a hole new wave of adoption so we may have a another bubble 1600 which settles at a new low of 800 then again and again.. or we may from now on get a agonisingly slow price rise. Who knows.. but its not bad news trust me. FOR some reason people think from 1200 we should just keep rising no wayyyy we need much more adoption and with all these peice of shit altcoins camoflouging the real deal makes it even slower for adoption.

Circle is very user freindly and can verify in 1 second... especailly if your in US. i was lucky i was from AUS and i did it with my card and its all good to go.. even though they have a lock now no more NON-US  cards until they expand .. so lucky i already have a card locked on there. When i first joined within 5 min i had btc in my offline storage
@_date: 2014-10-02 05:29:56
This is not correct the fee changes with the amount of BTC i purchase it is treating it like a cash advance. Circle doesnt know what my bank will charge them. this fee is instantly appearing on the purchase on circle. If what your saying is correct there is some hidden fee i am not seeing then how do circle know exactly how much it os without even knowing the bank i bank with. I have already spoken to my bank there is no fee with online purhases i have done this for many years

But its not centralised only a small portion is, there has to be some group co-ordinating and organising things otherwise it can get messy, i dnt see this as being centralised like a bank.. this is what we really should be afraid off.  They still need consesus, we can all view the code, they cant make bitcoins from thin air, they may have alittle more power implementing code just as some do now, but if we dont like it we just move away and laugh at the people who destroyed the worlds greatest financial system, they will be in the history books, when you see the word fail you will see all their faces lined up next to each other in the dictionary..
Anyway this is not one a single person, and i doubt he will sit on a throne and demand things, obvuosly it will work the same way as it is now as the foundation devs are doing it... and wouldnt you want the code to benefit the coin otherwise the backbone of why you exist fails? so in otherwords they would need to be extremely careful stepping into btc because perception is a huge thing here, if they fail this they fail consesus and votes and btc goes to the curb. There is a team of devs working together on both playing fields i thought that if something works great on the side chain they will organise a meeting with the main net devs and see how they we can make it fit etc..... that would be awesome...by the way how does blockstream make its money?

The problem is ppl dont want to throw in money and then nothing changes for the protocol.. if there is a voting system where the devs list top 10 protocol changes or adjustments from 1 being most priority and 10 being less priority .. this way people can see what there helping with then each time one gets done.. its  crossed off the list untill all are done. Then a new group of 10 updates gets listed and the dev team starts again

No they expect this bro. Theu will and they are aware fraidsters will slip the gaps. The risk is calculated ... eg.  First limit is only $500 limit per week. They have other steps to avoid the fraudsters and if some slip the gaps there benefits are are worth more than the risks. No one will do it if they are going to lose in the end and if they end uo losing more then benefiting then they will adjust there processes

In regards to btc soon there, will be more apps and easy to use bitcoin apps and things that will make it even easier to spend, actually diamondcircle.net in aus already has nfc btc terminals aswell as debit cards with secure key no 3rd party only you and the card.

@_date: 2014-09-05 01:51:00
thats probably why its never 100%... always 99.9%  as max... i like this idea.. its based on what is happening as we speak. Ofcourse no one will know 100% . Thats like going to a restaurant sitting and eating 100-200 meal the owner usually makes his own judgements and if you look like your not a drunk junkie you will be allowed to sit eat AND THEN pay. We all can run after we eat to maximise our daily income expense profits but we run the risk of not being trusted their anymore.. it was a good buck while it lasted but not so great for long term .. and what the owner does is put out his own judgment which is never 100% to allow you to eat before you pay. Merchants can use this feature as a bonus to their own judgment calling. They can still choose to wait for 1 confirm.
Saying all that above... and now lets go to the front end of the person  transacting &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is not easy to do a double spend.....  Most (virtually all) nodes will reject and refuse to relay or include in a block the second transaction they see as it widely known as bad actor. If all miners setup their miners to accept transactions with greater fee well nothing happens here because the miners dont know another transaction is coming so they will accept the first one. what happens when the 1st transaction is seen 1st with a normal fee? 60 seconds later (which is quite some time in blockchain world) another transaction comes in with a little more fees. What will happen? Well if i did it from most wallets both will be accepted in the blockchain and sender looses both coins lol if your some sort of hacker and tried to duplicate the same transaction then as said above most miners will reject the 2nd transaction they see

Plus the more coins there are it will be inflating the more important currency by making ppl beleive there is too many to choose from, and being distractions and blinding people from the more powerful, valuable  assest which is backed by over 300million of invester funds and some of the biggest names in the internet world. Look yes, i recon there will be other coins but they will be experiments at most.. the rest will exist but be so insignificant it would be a joke to even hang around them.

I said "permanent" discounts from places such as- dell , expedia ,dish, overstock etc.. if btc is really cheaper for them to process and accept they should pass on some of discounts to consumer using it.. i know newegg and dell had some promotion but they were not permanent. Well the savings from accepting btc are permanent so they should pass it on permanently.
This way ppl will eventually be like "dam these bitcoin users get everything cheaper  lets start converting our fiat into btc so we can shop!! Now THIS is how we grow consumer use

Well if they intergrate it with GPN this would mean they will only intergrate the POS system with them only! so if a customer is on a site who is with GPN and they select the GPN payment option this then directs customer to the GPN payment gateway and then this is where you would select BITCOIN as the method .
This is how south africas payfast does is for 30,000 merchants by intergrating the POS system with Payfast's system only

They are the peoole who dont understand it and cannot beleive that its still working. All there conspiracy theories they tell there family and freinds all go to shit because the pure existence of bitcoin makes all their theories redundant .. so then they try to bag bitcoin and make that look like the conspiracy hoping that will help there previous shitty foilhat theories make sense and not make them look like shit talkers.

I cannot beleive this... i have done over 100 transactions from 0.01 &gt; 6btc ....for all i can remember... not a single transaction took longer than 12 minutes
Next time show proof ... how are we meant to know your telling the truth or you paid the fee. Trust no one
Anyway saying this .... why do ppl wait for confirmations for ... you do know even waiting 10 seconds after transaction is made cuts the chances much less and then 20 secs 30-40-50 . You wait 1 minute after the transaction is broadcasted theres been so many nodes that have seen it it will be extremely hard to reverse .. think about it this was 2 minutes after broadcast it is probably as secure as 1 litecoin confirmation transaction

For the more tech minded ppl we dont need any of these we know how to protect our funds and the protocol does the rest.... for all these ametures who are angry at btc because they bought in at 1000 and sold out at 500 or ppl who lost on mt gox or have been hacked some of these ppl are the type who should learn or would benefit from these services and proper online wallets with insurance like xapos vault.

Coinbase is doing exactly whay they should be doing.. they are even going as far as to contact authy for you.. and it seems authy did reply to you.. i dont get what the issue is with coinbase.. this issue is a client side issue. Authy works perfectly fine. If your phone &amp; authy is playing up you need to speak to authy to sort it.. does coinbase have a option to completely verify yourself from scratch to access your coins maybe a 30 second video of you holding your lisence, showing your face saying your complete phone number.. dob.. address .. full name and balance amount in coinbase after security verify this video and deem it legit maybe reset your account. Video needs to be atleast 480p and no more than 15mb ...your lisence photo an details need to be visible and clear aswell as yourself visible and clear

The most simple offline cold wallet is  a simple paper wallet + priv key  &amp; Mycellium
Mycellium is great as it deals with 1 address per wallet even after you send bitcoin from the address
 I love it as its like a bank account and you do t have to keep re-printing change wallet addresses if you wanted to use $100 from your cold storage so u scan the priv key and bring it online for a few seconds to pull funds out. Then send it back offline by deleting the key again from the wallet . Brilliant way i found
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:09:36
Yes but if you pay for something in btc every second you wait makes it much more secure.. it was spoken about before by satoshi even 0 confirmations is secure enough for most transactions... and by the way i have done over 100 transactions and never had to wait more than 11 minutes 90% of the time its done under 8 minutes... not sure why you would wait 1 hr.. youd have to be pretty unlucky if your paying the right fèe . Also If shop owners are educated enough to realise that you really dont have to wait for a confirmation if you can see the transaction broadcasted, as it is the same risk and accepting a cheque or a cc and not having a chargeback done.. if anything id say its even more secure then these. Once they know this, the waiting for 5-10minutes is not needed for the majority of transactions.

All these detractors of the internet came out when internet started... come on seriuosly you think btc will stay the way it is now for ever? Bitcoin NOW will not change the world but bitcoin in 10-15yrs will put a large dent in the way people do finance and contracts. Look at what blockstream is trying to do... and you say the wealth is not distributed? It can be VERY easily if more people bought . You know how much people are mining and instantly selling? Thats distribution right there there us enough sell orders now to supply a large portion of the population and if demand gets low btc prices rise so that even a few points of btc is worth quite abit of money.

It is literally programmable money, yes you heard right PROGRAMMABLE, for non techies reading, it meañs you can make your money do things. Amaziñg!!!

Simply because apple is nothing to compare bitcoin with, btc is a whole new paradigm of finance and OFFCOURSE takes more time for ppl to adapt probably rven more so now . Applepay used the same old traditional payment system and utilised nfc, thats all nothing groundbreaking about it... here in AUS we have had nfc tap n pay for over a year now all cards now come with nfc chip embedded within. You can literally tap your wallet over the paywave system not revealing any cc numbers or name details. But guess what? because its so simple, and doesnt require you to authorise the payment, whats to stop anyone from taking your card and going on a shopping spree? Well Their "so called" trick is to only allow payments under $100 to go through paywave, anything over requires you to insert your card and enter a pin revealing details. If applepay allows you to make $1000+ payments by just tapping your phone... the banks better get ready for more stolen phones and hacks they need to deal with

Comment on that article says it perfectly-
"Yes!!! Stop making 2.0 when 1.0 isn’t even out of the gate yet!! Everyone’s efforts should be put towards enhancing Bitcoin. Not recreating the wheel. Sidechains and tree chains should be able to do the vast majority of this and make Bitcoin even greater. But alas, everyone wants to be rich. So they push alt coins and 2.0 pump and dumps with all their might."
@_date: 2014-11-09 02:03:01
Well the plan would be that the sidechains are pegged to bitcoin so the mining bitcoin will be like mining the sidehains... dont think about sidechains as seperate coins... they willl be mostly for things other than currency as we already have btc the currency, there is no need for more coins really... if btc was the only currency it would be worth more than it would now... with all those 500 crappy altcoins and the distractions.. its almost like a shittier version of inflation.

By the time that happens and IF that happens you most orders you will see will benin points like 0.00000234 which is equivalent to $234 dollars but again by this time we would need to add more decimals as right now the fee is 0.0001 this would be ridiculous even a $1 fee of 0.00000001 is too much .... the good thing about being digital is you can brake a btc peice into tiny segments

No matter how much people say some coins are not copies.. the fact of the matter is they are in the eyes of mainstream...all of them existed because of bitcoin.
 None existed before... 95% of the world will not look into source code to see the differences.. so they will go by the biggest crypto there is.. bitcoin will always be ahead as long as there is investor funds and there is PLENTY.. Bitcoin is also not stale...in fact FAR from it.. we have (Blockstream)-sidechains coming and if thats done properly...(property, smart contracts, applications, assests, multisig financial contracts ETC...)  &lt;&lt;&lt; all this will follow.

Doge 1? LOL what a joke.
make people rich?? Doubt it.Not with that silly name and mascot..the main reason all these coins started to exist is because everyone wants to try be the first people to start mining hoping there beloved hundreds of thousand doggy toy tokens even reach 1 dollar which will be a miracle. Everyone should be concentrating on the btc eco system for now as nothing else brings anything extra special to the table.
 
Lmao seriously but..
Dog + money is just ridiculous mix ..dogecoins image literally looks like a childs token for toys, some sort of joke.. the funny thing is it literally came from a joke/meme but in my opinion it has not moved from this scene. And the only reason it has some sort of market cap is because there is almost 90 billion coins
Plus why would you buy doge when you can buy bitcoin accepted by over 100, 000 merchants and more daily... more than 250million has been invested into the btc eco system this is more than the internet when it first came out.. 
just buy mBTC if your one of those people who like to feel like they got some money instead of looking at decimals of a full coin.. i find that stupid that people would buy another  "even more" uncertain coin just so they can say they have 100000 coins of something.. thats how funny some humans are
@_date: 2014-08-28 08:44:44
I find it sooo funny and stupid how people think owning bitcoin requires u to buy a full coin .. its digital for goodness sake it doesnt mean anything but 1 000 000 bits ... lollllll its a fkn number that is divisible so it doesn't matter.  All you need to know is more bits = more money

I sold my litecoin for well above the market rate i then got a chargeback and then i got the money in the end because the time realised this was a scam i instantly thought "shit paypal only protects the buyer if something was actually shipped" i went poat office and posted 3 little silver 5c peices to the address on the paypal and sent the proof to paypal.. i essentially turned the sale into real coins .. paypal never even questioned it. I got my money from paypal and i guess the scammer got his coins and im guessing the owner of the paypal got his money also.. im not sure but
Really quick thinking enabled me to not get ripped off but use the paypal system to the full advantage

Yawnnnnn here we go again!!!!... same old post after same old price drop... so many weaklings.. why would you buy btc in the early days when its known fact that  its going to be like this for the next few years, hearing the same old shit is getting irritating as fk,  Dont you get it yet??? Seriously.. its the adoption that makes btc rise and this is happening gradually and very slowly... although, soon it may be possible to see it spike when new companies come out in certain areas which then boosts adoption quickly.. like payfast in south africa and global payments network.. anouncments is one thing but if no adoption happens this is why you dont see spike after announcments.. people dont go running to buy btc after every good annoucment. I bet you everytime you see it spike downwards abit its more than likely an old holder decided to buy a property or a yot with his btc lol and unloaded a large lump  ..since its early days and adoption is low... anyone whos sneizes bitcoin on the media or whoever decides to buy something real expensive you will see it impact the market

Btc goes up and down get it??? Its volatile ppl who buy in know this and the smart ppl are in it long term the idiots who buy at 600 and then sell at 485 and cry deserve it because thats just ridiculous AND DUMB! you should be aware that btc is volatile and could even go to 200 and them creep back up.

This prediction is ONLY based on the lucky guess prediction you made to reach this current stage... which by the way was TOTAL luck.. what your saying is that again btc will drop by half again 12months time if you want to continue your prediction algo. You do realise we have governments, senates, lawmakers, lawyers, investors, massive corporations now involved in btc your price prediction is putting below the price it was before even 1/4 of the above were involved theres over 300mill investment dollars banking on this thing not to fail more than there was invested in the internet the first 8yrs  Your predicitions are going way up against the flowimg river

@_date: 2014-08-18 06:47:24
You need to tell the exchanges this! they are the ones that can put systems in place.. you wouldnt not want to implement that kind of thing in the core.  The problem is no matter what you implement in the core.. someone will always have something else to implement.. its a never ending cycle. This is why i like saying bitcoin is perfect as is, just clean up the minor bugs will be enough for me. (Ofcourse after the 7 transactions a second i sorted that is) but thats in progress and the most important thing on the list :D everything else can be implemented ontop of bitcoin.

If BTC devs got involved with BTC and i mean REALLY GOT INVOLVED then we will have the same features as etherium we dont really need ethereum. Gav explained a really simple bitcoin 2.0 without ethereum. The wheel is already spinning with great speed. There is no need to re-invent another wheel and start to spin it when bitcoins is getting stronger by the day. There are already features starting .. smart contracts.. decentralized market places.. color coins , property.. all using bitcoin.. we really do not need ethereum. I do not understand why they are designing something so complicated when there is no need for it. Type "gavin ethereum" in google

There are bugs im EVERY system but bitcoin has been tested by THOUSANDS of individuals and there are no dangerous bugs you can use to exploit.

I agree, for the majority of ppl its more hassle than ease... i myself definitley find it easier to spend bitcoin but this is because i own some in the first place and i am very computer literate... when ppl own some and they are computer or tech literate then i beleive its easier than using paypal or credit card.. less steps .. simply copy address to clipboard and use your wallet in your phone.. yes its not 10x faster but i beleive its a fraction faster and we dont need to be scared about our cc details or paypal accounts being hacked...and its just feels more seemless.... inregards to being forbidden about diff payment methods i didnt know this very interesting and ridiculous.... maybe merchants need to play the game and keep repeating the promo codes and changing the promo end date.. i think in that way u can bend around that forbidden rule. Yes i agree btc has a long way to go but i know and you know its only goin to get easier and easier with more and more wallets coming out every month

In regards to altcoins:
Do you think having over 300 languages all over the world is essential? Or do you think it is more of a hinderance?  Think very carefully about that.
there is no need for more than 1 digital coin which is doing the same thing.... you wait till sidechains kicks into bitcoin, you will see how even more useless alts are.
Like seriously , a dogcoin? You may aswell take wankcoin seriously... just because a hoard of idiots decide to say yay make wow doggy yum yum money wow big... and every1 laughs and memes go viral THE ONLY REASON PPL.HAVE IT is because its cheaper than my piss and they think they may become rich one day in their lifetime loll  now thats what i call funny

He has a point.. i think btc should be a little regulated but only to stop any dick and harry from starting a business, obviosly we dont wany to choke all startups but we need to sort the good from all the rubbish around in this community. Eventually if too many idiots start business way over their heads and this commumity is going to look worse than the wild west everyone will lose their trust.

Its actually very simple... not enough buy orders ... too many sale orders from all the merchants converting back to $ plus all the mined btc . This is why when reward drops price goes up. Because there is less mined btc per day. Most miners convert to $ to recoup losses.. slowly as adoption increases the scales will tip towards more buy orders and when this day comes we will start to see btc increase

This is like asking someone in 1990 whats the quikest way to write to someone.. offcourse it was email.. but at this early stage .. both sender and receiver would need to join a provider.. buy a modem .. learn how to connect to the internet and then learn how to use the email app it would be far quicker to use current resource available

You need to do more research why are you downloading bitcoin core for? Do you want your computer to become a node which helps the network.. like being a seed for a torrent you downloaded OR are you just wanting a simple wallet to store some bitcoin? If it is the latter then you dont need to download the whole blockchain.. get multibit or electrum or armory or you can use blockchain.info  which is like an web wallet...ITS NOT AN ONLINE HOT WALLET so you cam trust it. If you have an smart phone, im particular android.. i would pick mycellium!

Yes we are at the beggining.. we all know the start of any new world disrupting evolutionary product/technology is going to be shaky especially when we have goverments trying to regulate/understand it anf then you have 10000s of miners trying to make ROI by dumping their coins on the market. Time will settle.. especially when reward drops and larger mining data centres start appearing all over the place... the more ppl invested in it the more ppl that dont want their investment going into the drain.

So your saying that this person austin wants to destroy the very thing his working on? Lol centralising bitcoin is destroying it by the way... people will sell like there is no tomorrow and in the end NO ONE will use bitcoin... you seem to have your own set idea about what this guy wants and your idea is basically saying that all the core devs are idiots.. including Gav... gavin seems to be ok with what his doing, i doubt very much he is trying to take over all development and have his way or the highway, i bet his trying to implement new things and then ask for consesus from gav and the rest of the devs and then see if they can merge it with bitcoin core and get consesus with the community, i really doubt his going to try take over dictatorship style

Opinion - if this is another attempt to create another altcoin in a sneaky type of way then this concept is  ruined  by making another useless token when you could have easily use bits ONLY.. should be bitcoin and only bitcoin. Why wouldnt you use the worlds most popular digital currency as the ONLY token you can send, you can easily send BITS even if you buy 10 x bitcoins and spread the 10 million bits around - i dont know, everytime i see a new token i think the devs want themselves rich by hoping their tokens gain value. Seems to me like they are btc earlybird wannabes... since they were too late to be rich of bitcoin or so they think.
GEMBITZ is what it should be called and dealing in satoshis is how it should work... who the hell wants GEMS? when people hear you be getting bitcoin? Now thats a marketting driver.
Anyway this is why i would not use this and many others mosy likely also, and you know what even people who dont know about crypto wont be as enthusiastic as they would if they here BITCOIN is involved, many people now associate BITCOIN with money now which is why its much more attractive then anything else

This idiot got cut hard so now has a grudge join the list of idiots who have a grudge with btc, go sit and dont even talk about btc as it reeks with biasness. 
Some of the smartesr people are not early adopters and are bringing new ideas to the table and are just as exited as the new adopters. Thank god you lost all but 200 that should teach you that btc is not a get rich scheme but a real innovative financial/propert trustless ledger.
Off course the early adopters benifitted for fuk sake they are the ones who took the risk not even knowimg it will take off. Just like the cleaners at Microsoft who got rich because they bought some of the first stocks. Now  think of today can you jump intp microsoft and think of getting rich in a month,  Not likely. Same with btc but unlike microsoft btc will be bigger and it is STILL IN its infancy.

I still cant believe how many ppl start bagging out btc every time we get into a dip.

I just read the blog "why we are cofounders", if sidechains is trying to remove the need for multiple currencies, this is awesome isnt it? Bitcoin is the only currency we need and we need to innovate on top of it like there is no tomorrow. Not create a whole new blockchain with a whole new currency , im sik of altcoins  if this is going to help bitcoin why not? If you think 1 man will have control over ALL the bitcoins developement that sounds like a lot of BS to me if the core devs actually allow this to happen then they too are BS and dont even deserve developing on this amazing technology. I somehow beleive this is not the case and the main aim for sidechains is to innovate faster and seemlessly without effecting amd risking main net

The more miners the better for btc.. why tel ppl to stop?? its up to them if they want to help the ecosystem and make some coins on the side... its better for the the people whò dont mine. I mined for almost 1 year before i stopped and sold all my miners and bought btc with the money. The trick is if yoy have free elecricity ar work. Grab yourself 2 x 4-5TH miners and just let them mine.. you will make roi in 3-4 months and then profit from then on.. it is still worth it for ppl with cheap power or people who know how to manage $$ and calculations..Technical/Business minds are handy in this type of investment scenario.. also if you want to unload the.miners the trick is unload them when they are still able to make some coin and not obselete.. just before they are obselete is perfect timing.. dont be left holding the hot potatoes. Unless of course you have free power then just never turn them off and add to the hardware with more hardware

I bet ya there is some corrupt bullshit going on at some exchsnges.. how can orders be goinf for 450 and then drop $100-less then go back up to 450 again... who in the right mind would sell btc for less then there worth.

If you were the first person on EARTH to find gold and decided to mine it as you think it may be worth something in future because it looks pretty and you think it may be very useful.. does this mean  that no one will ever want to buy gold of you because they think its not fair that you were first on the scene? Which infact was a risk to you because you had to invest in all the mining gear risking that no one will want it or even think its worth anything.
NOTE: BTC ONLY has value at the moment of the trade or sale. They will be distributed and spread out one way or another. It doesnt matter who was there first, this is how life is with MANY things not only bitcoin, first ppl on the scene of something special usually are the ones that benefit the most. Eg; Alot of the cleaners who worked at Microsoft who had shares are now richer than the microsoft general managers high up in the chain working there asses off 9-5, offcourse thats if they were smart with their money they made when the share price exploded and didn't lose it all gambling. But yeh in regards to having value, think of it like the first person who found gold mined ALL OF IT on his own and then hoarded it without touching it till the day he dies. What did the gold do for him in his lifetime? Nothing, he may aswell of held 0 as it was never distributed, even distributing it to 10 people would make massive difference in the value as it causes a chain reaction. It has to be used if it is to have any value. Sold , obtained goods with, traded with etc this is how the market gives it the value...and this is how BTC will slowly be distributed. Lets not forget 80% of miners sell coins which is really helping in the distribution. The chain reaction of bitcoin distribution has already started infact the price dropping and all the panic sales helps further by distribution, the whole system is working perfectly in my eyes.

Not a loophole at all
 As per my comment below. This is expected and satoshi even stated. If you lose your btc consider it a future gift for the community as the price will raise the less btc there is around.

People will not buy a product of ebay for the same price as there local shop. Plus you risk doing the the work and having a product sit in your hands without sale.
Ebay takes 10% paypal 2.9% you then nèed to organize shipping 10% you will pay this if you really want to sell it otherwise no one will buy a product and add shipping to it if they can get it from local shop for same price. Then after all that if you actually want to sell it you need to discount it another 10% from the local shops price.
Good luck with all that lol

:p  Ive never seen one. But yeh your definitley right there maybe 2 people on earth (BricKnMortar) but here is a challenge, find a merchant that would keep any percentage in doge unless they are a mum n daddy shop who are invested in this copycat coin ;) 
My opinion - all these 500+ coins are just a waste of space and time and inflating the crypto industry, they all wanna be the next satoshi + bitcoin, but difference is they are hungry to become rich from satoshis Idea and code, instead of supporting the king off coins they'd make a useless doggy token which any outsider would look at as a kids play coin.

I dont pay anything for my current debit cars.. no transaction fee, no monthly fee! And i have been with 3 banks which are all the same.  i know with credit cards there is a fee.

So your telling me that EVERYsingle coin holder has to vote and if one single person doesnt vote then no decesion can be made?. Or a decision can be made with or without EVERYsingle coin holder makimg a vote? meaning it is not trustless. Anyway there seems to be to much of a manual political system happening here. My main question here is Why would you need to create a new coin when one coin is BOOMING why assume the future when you cannot see it. Do you realise how many people doubted satoshi and bitcoin stating it wont work and brought out soooo many reasons why it wont work. What astonishes me is it has worked and shocked and actually fkn booming if you ask me and look back 4 yrs. Now as it is in the middle of its booming years a whole other breed of nay sayers now jump on and make a whole other set of reasons why bitcoin will be doomed, noticed how it changed to wont work  to now failing in future. You do realise right there are nay sayers everywhere and even if bitsharesx was the first coin that was created and some miracle brought it where btc is today.. there will be another breed of nay sayers.. Money makes the world go round and im betting it will also play a big factor in the future of btc.. there are some massive players in BTC with huge $  banking on the success of it,  so beleive me when i tell you if btc is in trouble it will naturally evolve. Its not in trouble now and far from it for the time being.
 With btc ppl dont think about the Rewards will drop downward pressure will ease dramatically within 10 years.. i truly beleive there are over 400 ppl that are trying to be the next satoshi... for gds sake we are in the middle of a radical change of financial system era and here are people truly only thinking about being on the next boat as it was initially with btc
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:51:35
Question .. when you purchased with it.. did you buy back the same amount? Because that purchase most likely would have created another sell order  @ BTC/usd which atm infact contribute to the downward pressure of the market price :)

What are you talking about... its not a big deal it will eventually stablise when coin minting reduces and userbase grows ... the algorithm is fine you cant expect a digital currency taking on a very old currency system HEAD ON and one which me and you, your dad and your dads great great great great great grand father was brought up with and existed well before then up untill now. You expect a 5 year digital currency to be stable already? after taking on the whole concept of what money is and was. Have you heard what makes the world go round? Bitcoin is in a realm BIGGER than the internet was Lets not forget its not only taking on 1 currency its taking the whole WORLDs "idea of money" on

Funny that, ive seen some issues with circle from some people. I personally cannot fault them. Literally everytime i deposit money within a second the coins are in my circle account and within another second i send them to my offline wallet by the time i press the home button on my S5 - android &gt; then goto apps&gt; and click "Mycellium wallet" the funds are already broadcasted and are showing on receiving and waiting for confirmation. So roughly 10 seconds from deposit to opening up mycellium is the time it takes for me to see the funds out of my circle wallet and into my other
Amazing

In Japanese, Satoshi means “clear-thinking” or “wise.” Naka can mean “inside” or “relationship” and moto is used to describe “the origin” or “the foundation.” Put it all together and you get “thinking clearly inside the foundation.” 
Wow satoshi must of thought about this nick name for ages.. because the meaning is amazing.  Make sure you guys dont take off your foil caps.

There is definitley a fee which i thought was not the case... they pass this fee onto the customer from visa (proccesing fee). But when i choose $60 usd i get $60 in btc its never less but + visa fee that THEY CHARGE not my bank, circle charges my debit card including the fee.
Choose BTC .... NOT  USD... if you did choose BTC THEN THIS is odd i have a feeling instead of charging different amount from your bank(as this can cause further headache), when btc rises or falls they choose to keep the debit amount the same and increase or decrease as per btc exchange rate at that last second of purchasing.
Although i guess they have to charge fee since your buying money.  Bur i have a feeling there is slight spread which means there really is a fee if you look at coinbase before fee i have been told its cheaper but with their fee it puts them little behind. This must mean there is spread = secret fee

Are you even reading the solutions in this thread? First of all bitfast commented something if you check this may solve most of the issues. And if you take look at how long a credit card takes to fully confirm I guarantee you its alot longer than 10 minutes ... so just think there a ways to solve this issue without changing the security of the confirmations and orphan percentage. . You just keep looking at these alt coins and think they are the best because of 30 second confirmations when you dont realise to be as secure as 1 btc confirmation it would need 20 x 30 second confirmations. Reason why you get downvoted is because your probably one of the 1000s of other ppl who point to a problem without a solution.. all this is being worked on behind the scenes I guarantee you if there was an equally secure way to have faster confirms it would be done

Your post made me think nick is on ethereum team which he is NOT. Anyway, offtopic I recon ethereum is a waste of energy and time going into spinning an entirely new wheel when we already have one mega large one spinning and more than $$1/4 Billion Dollars$$. Sorry but something irritates me about vilatek or whatever his name is, If this pencil neck geek used his inflated brain of knowledge into building new bitcoin 2.0 tools ONTOP of bitcoin instead of an entire new token and blockchain .. we would be way ahead and SO WOULD THEY. The geek got swamped by money hungry dogs who want to be the new early birds of yet ANOTHER altcoin, only this one more decorated and developed with over 20+ developers trying to get sticky fingers in the pie. As Gav said we dont need ethereum its much easier getting these types of things it built ontop of bitcoin and MUCH cheaper + less complicated.

Transactions one after the other is no problem, no confirmation is needed. mycellium is the best wallet out there.. by the way most of my transactions confirm in 6-8minutes.. thats pretty dam fast for 100% confirmed and unreversable with awesome security behind it.
If the 10minute was a REAL problem it would be first inline to be fixed but as u can see it isnt, there are millions upon MILLIONS of dollars in bitcoin dev work so beleive me when i say if it becomes a prob it will be fixed. Litecoin network power is so much smaller than btc meaning MUCH less risk and less transactions happening.. if there was a coin with an ecosystem as large as btc then the 2.5min would have been an equal test .. but btc is huge and there must be some risk behind it which is why it isnt done, they would have done it the first week btc protocol was done if they thought this is better

Put it this way - as soon as someone does what you are trying to do but instead of an altcoin they choose BTC as the only coin in the app. They will take you out of business you'll see.

Szabo musnt be that smart then, lost TOTAL respect..I totally disagree that bitcoin wont go anywhere but being a currency. Is he blind!!! There are already things being built ontop of bitcoin... i just read today about smart contracts starting.. openbazaar is another decentralized market being built using bitcoin/ multi sig. Even gav stated that there is really no need to build a totally new wheel when we have the worlds most powerful wheel already spinning.. he stated in a few simple sentences how bitcoin 2.0 can be implemented without all the complexity behind ethereum... 
"Hedgy" another startup utilising smart contracts and hedging against votality... you watch whats going to happen. Bitcoin will grow so fast ppl wont see a reason for ethereum

So in those sentences that he stated you came to the conclusion that Elon knew what bitcoin is about... wow well my mother also knows as much as he does.
In reality those few comments he stated didnt tell us anything about how much he knew and the broader public seems to know the same.

Thank gooooooodnessssss for blockstream and sidechains we dont neeed millions of currencys to inflate the fuk out of our wallets.. we only need one scarce currency and 1000s of experiments, 1 earth = 1 currency &amp; i think company tokens is ok to be dealt within organisations or stuff like that.. but its so much more simple if we all were interchangable ... from 1 corner of earth to the other, by having one currency or even 1 digital world reserve currency it would make life so much easier.... BITCOIN + sidechains is going to eliminate the need for these copies altshits or make them even more insignificant then they are now. I cannot wait for the innovation to start.
@_date: 2014-09-02 08:31:39
This exactly what i say to myself ... when the price is down people start commenting about how btc is failing. . How merchants are driving prices down.. how devs aren't doing enough work .don't ppl get it yet .. btc is a baby and all this volatility has happened numerous times, it may takes years to mature and develop. . If the current devs aren't doing enough they will get phased out naturally by the new gen.. you will see. I am surprised i have only been here for 1 year and i dont get scared or budge when prices go down im in it for long term ... i believe in this alot!

Exactly its just people are very impatient they buy into btc and expect ONLY TO SEE A RISE soon as they see a decrease all these stories start coming out. As above poster said its inevitable eventually too many merchants will accept bitcoin they wont need to trade into cash as they will be able to re-stock using btc pay there bills using btc.

Guys they are not accepting these coins aswell as bitcoin.. its GOCOIN that are the dmcunts. We dont even have bitcoin down pat and we have these dickheads offering even more coins. Fkn joke coins and copy cat coin? Its a joke. That dog coin does my head in geeeeez what kind of toy money is this &gt;&gt;&gt; A DOG?? A FUCKN DOGS HEAD ON A FKN COIN bahahha what a joke. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; that is what the public thinks. Honestly all these bullshit coins are camoflouging bitcoin soon its going to be hard to se through all the bullshit. The only thing that is doing is making people think that digital coins are a joke, and they will all stay away. Dogecoin and litecoin where get rich quick schemes. The creaters wanted to be one of the first to mine like satoshi but instead i bet ya they cashed out much more than satoshi did. There was no need for more coins bitcoin can supply billions.

Bro... i never spoke about circle. Today i state that by FAR circle is the best company to buy BTC from.
I am from Aus-sydney.. i joined circle.. gave them my address and DOB i then added my visa debit card. Just as a test i decided to purchase $40usd. No joke it was instant. And then as another test i instantly transfered it to cold storage. Again instant.
total time from joining to having BTC in my offline wallet= 4 minutes
Never not even im my own country was i ever able to do that. So by far This has changed the game in many countries. Its even cheaper to buy from circle than it is to buy from the 3 cheapest exchanges in australia
@_date: 2014-05-24 04:53:44
Well just incase you do not find any ...I know the easiest way would be to convert btc &gt; $ and this opens your options
@_date: 2014-09-25 11:20:36
Wait a minute im confused. The people you say who will continue mining because they beleive in future price, why would these people sell the btc they mined if they beleive in the future price of it..
And if people stop mining dont you realise hashrate and difficulty drops allowing the little guys to jump back in and profit..where there is easy money there is ppl so this wont happen... and if it does it all works out perfectly because there will be even more individual miners mining with smaller machines as the diff will be low and then if it gets high again it will end up where we are now. Media will have nothing to say because btc is created in away that it is prepared for this.
@_date: 2014-08-16 09:44:50

@_date: 2014-09-05 09:27:01
Well why not pump it to $2000 if thats the case. Dont you realise markets go up and down and because of the size of btc a big buy can make price move up down quite visbly
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:11:44
I do not expect prices to start moving up untill coin distribution slows down and block reward halfs and then halves again even... untill then for the user base this is more inflated than USD.
Its still early time i dont get why people are even wondering... id actually be more surprised if the price shoots up and spikes instead of the current situation--&gt;  up &gt; down &gt; down &gt; up &gt; up &gt; down &gt; up

NO ONE CAN FK AROUND WIT THE KING BITCOIN just because you were able to afford multiple cheap as shit gldcoin does not mean they will rise ,  your one of those ppl that want to try get rich by being an earlybird and not spending too much money... and you say to yourself gldcoin just sounds like the perfect coin... "gold" &amp; "coin" fkkkk we cant lose. Let me tell you something bro your going to lose and you may aswell dump the rubbish and get to the real shit. I cant beleive you have not figured this out yet, i figured this out 4 months after i got into crypto. Sorry for the straight out blunt
@_date: 2014-08-13 07:06:41
I beleive there is some manipulation to some extent as there is with every single market... but the entire thing isnt.. ppl think that btc is supposed to reach 2000 anytime now and if it doesnt then something is wrong. More merchants accepting doesnt mean shit... what means shit is more people who are our neighbours start buying btc and start using it not 20 ppl im talkimg 10000s of people ... obviously if spending with btc has an edge over cc and money then it will grow.. we all know it has benefits for merchants but does it really benefit the people with a debit card and money.. we must question how the fuk is btc that good that it will make people disregard their debit cards and start using bitcoin merchants HAVE TO START charging less for online usage and this is the way it will bring ppl... since the merchants pay hardly anything why should they cost the same as a product sold with debit card

  Go measure what all the worlds banks and there branchs, security, data centers,  lighting., armour trucks, i think all that makea btc look like a baby energy consumer.  Asics getting more efficient. . We can even run mining farms of solar panel.
Bitcoims proof of work is the most powerful secure system we currently have.. people need to relax.. i cant believe all the naysayers. Guess what? there were many naysayers when satoshi showed the white paper. . But I bet they are all eating ther words now and you will eat yours in a few years. The market evolves and it will solve the problems that arise

The difference is you cannot spend stocks like money instant transfer.. and  once more consumers start accepting even putting in some incentives like 2% off when u purchase with BTC  this will make u think about spending

Same like australia... simple as 1 2 3... takes 1 day to open and verify your account with a bank account. Once verified its so simple from then on to' deposit money, withdraw, sell

You think btc is failing because price is low?  Its stronger than it ever was and price will correct itself if it be lower then so be it. It needs to balance the sell orders.  Once this corrects itself then then price will stay or increase simple as that. This doesnt mean its failing. We all know that adoption needs to increase thats VERY obvious

I understand, everyone will have there own ideas on how things work and this will never end, even with your idea. BTW I edited my above just before you typed not sure if you read the changes, the thing is it will not be held by 10 people and if it did you will not know about and if demand was there the price will increase on the rest of the digits evening it out and correcting itself because of supply and demand. As said the market will choose, id choose something not because of who owns what i choose something that is fair and supply is not controlled by a central organisation. It really doesnt matter, aslong as it is available to you when you want it and it is spendable.
Th point is btc is working and its only been 3 yrs as the first couple not many people were even doing anything with it or using it. I think you will be surprised on the outcome as many have been already.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:16:28
I dont understand why so.many altcoins exist... the only reason i can think off is they are easy to.mine and ppl think there goimg to be the early birds mining with a gpu and become rich... its all about being rich om fiat.. no alt coim bring any real benefit to the place they just make things worse be camflouging the whole eco system with shit.. confusing newbies and promising the moon if you join .. all fukn bs if u ask me.

Do you realise that there are 100s of millions of dollars in investment in the first 4 years of bitcoin... imagine in 50 or 100 years time how much more money will be poured into it lol i find it funny how ppl are worried about things so far into the future when there may not even be an issue...do you really think they wont solve the issue IF it is an issue by that time ?   Lollll go throw your money in coins with no outlook into the future.
Bitcoin has monster investors making sure it succeeds.
@_date: 2014-10-21 04:19:55
If EVERYONE were to convert the bitcoin the price will stabelise because MORE people agree that this is worth THIS ... trust me when i say that because its a young market the price fluctuates as the current liquidity can be felt throughout market depth. As the market grows the votility will decrease as the market depth increases and buys and sales and news will be felt much less in the trading market arena. If i sell 10,000 bitcoins you will all feel it in the price... now lets say market has grown and because the demand has grown so will the price because it will outweigh the sell pressure. Lets not forget people will also be dealing with less btc because each btc will be worth 4-5x it is now... example ppl that have 20btc now have a quite nice chunk off cash but 3 yrs ago the same equivalent would be some 1925btc so as you can see rhe tradings will shrink as time goes creating less effect on the network. It may eventually be rare that you see a buy or sell order of 5btc

Why would you need to increase the cap? This will destroy the ENTIRE MEANING of why satoshi made the coin and also make it like an inflatable fiat dollar. There is no way it will be increased. If the price gets too high per BTC it will just be divised further.
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:30:03
Well here is example you have 10btc which costed you $4500 to purchase.. if you hold and price goes up substantially you may be able to sell 1 btc for $4500 and there you have 100% profit

Dude have. Been checking out the dev. Bitcoin development soundforge site ?  Every day people are on there designing discussing future patches updates fixes etc... there is also a whole other world building apps on another layer ontop of bitcoin... the core is pretty stable .. when the fix the 7 transaction per second thing  and maybe auto adjustable fees. Then i think the core is pretty much set, scalable and all that is needed is layer and apps ontop of bitcoin

Dogecoin is the silliest sounding/looking/shit phrased/annoyingly followed/cheapo coin i have ever seen..
Heres a story---&gt; I showed my mum the list of altcoins and she pointed to the coin with a dog on it and said whats that... is that for dogs? It was quite embarrasing talking to her about the seriousness of bitcoin and then explaining to her why there was a coin with a dog on it .. i got back to serious mode when i just made up something and told her that coin is a joke coin that people made for fun 1000 of them coins are not even worth a  cent.. nothing serious like bitcoin, where the amount of money poured into it is more than the internet in the mid 90s

There will be many server farns get it? Its up to the free man to run a server farm get it? This is what decentralised it and what bitcoin is. You cannot do that in a bank can you. 
The more effiecent miners get the more decentralised it will be also. When rewards drop there will be less daily dumping of btc in the market because there is less btc rewards...in return this is making the buy orders increase which is making btc price increase bringing even more ppl in the game.. just wait and see ;) 
Satoshi even said that in future mining will be done in large data centres.. the protocol still stays the same no unlimited printing like the reserve bank.. this is the impòrtant thing about bitcoin... and because thete will be 100s of dafa centres all around the earrh = no single point failure
Ps ontop of the 100s of LARGE data centres there will still be private garage miners with solar energy and powerfull machines &amp; thousands of world wide NÒDES.. now comeon thats pretty damm dectralised.. i dont see any single point failure here... the above sounds like nothibg like centralised.. everyone is free to run miners or nodes..

Im bettting satoshi thought of PoS or something similar and the risks with it made him do PoW instead. It may not be "as" economically freindly, but it still doesnt have as many risks as PoS and to hurt POW costs much more than pos its a hell of alot cheaper to attack POS. Just go google it.
Asics are becoming much more energy efficient as times goes by and solar is becoming more popular.
Also just think about all the resources fiat banks use - large electronic security vaults, 247 server warehouses, armoured cars, billions of lights, alarm systems, security guards.

Simple. The price of BTC WILL rise as demand increases there will ALWAYS be sellers. If the demand goes way sky high then having 1 full btc may mean that you are well off and it may be very rare to buy a full btc because its expensive. Since btc is digital each decimal byte is worth $ .. ppl will be buying fractions. So 0.00003451 maybe be worth $780 . They can even add more decimal points to it from the core.
Breif.Demand increases btc rises
example if demand goes so high then 0.0000001 could be worth $1  meaning we would need to add more decimals . This would mean that 2 million btc is worth 4 trillion dollars

So its best to let things as they are working.. so many ppl doubted satoshi at the start but LOOOOK its working perfectly fine and much better than Banks,  credit cards, paypal etc...

Offcourse the price MUST RISE but the rising pattern doesnt have to follow your assumption of rise... i mean it can go all the way to 250 and then turn around back to 350 then go back to 230 the  up to 300 then 350 then back to 200 then up to 300 then 400 then 300 again then 420 then 530 then 500 and guess what year where in ? 2016.... so no you cant predict anything all of you ppl come out and say the same fkn shit again and again always at the price low moments.. annoying!!

Its all conspiracy due to the fact satoshi vanished... people have dug through the the core code for 5 years+ nothing of any sort... also sha256 has been looked through for even more years.
If sha 256 has a back door then many banks and security organisations would need to fix this also so just think its not only bitcoin looking through the code its MANY more ppl. If something is ever found it will be headline news and it will br patched within a few days.

Simply just copy your privte key  un-encypted on a peice of paper that looks like something else... half the key in 2 places so you need these 2 papers together to complete the key and place 1 half in a bible or something and put it in a book shelf with another books. And put the other half in a safe which is locked away with a key and pin.

Why on EARTH would you have given her coinbase... really??? Arnt you wired up in this community to figure  out circle is better? talk about the irony.
 Whats strange though is 1% is cheaper than cc fees right? Didnt she ask for CC so With circle she could have used CC for the usual visa fees. And you would have gotten your btc instantly. Visa Fee example.. $100 = $2.90  ... which is what credit companies normally charge. Some merchants absorb the fee unfortunatley circle doesnt. But they are still the best option, bank account link is absolutley free

Diamond circle in Australia already have tap to pay BTC terminals using NFC and they also have bitcoin debit NFC keycards linked directly to your bitcoin wallet which you only have the key to NOT diamond circle.. like your bank would have access to your debit card. So really all we needs is shops to buy this cheap $99 nfc readers and they can then accept bitcoin using free pos application WAY cheaper to adopt than apple pay.... by the way 90% of shops in aus have paypass using nfc... all our cc and debit cards have nfc chips inside.. the thing with NFC , there is $100 limit though because if someone steals your debit card all they have to do is tap and they got the goods. But the banks will refund this which is why they limit the tap to pay to $100 anything over prompts you to insert your card and type your pincode. So i would say apple pay has its $$ limits if there is no pin required as it would be too easy to rort the system - pretend your phone was stolen and you didnt realise untill 1 hr later.. wear a hat walk into a PC STORE tap and do a $1550 laptop purchase then 1 hr later claim your phone stolen and call the bank for a refund :)

Is there a sending id that is unique from each wallet address. Example is : if i sent 5 payments can the receiver see which wallet it came from?

Australia already has all the NFC infastructure in merchants ... we already use tap and pay with our cards so i dont think apple is going anywhere here.. we also have diamondcircle who is utilizing the NFC imfastructure for bitxoin.. i already have a btc  debit card waiting for merchants to add btc payment via diamond cirle .. this will explode if done.. the great thing about the diamond circle cards is that the private key is encrypted inside the card itself and diamondcircle is only the infastructure they cannot control your money... so if you have btc in that card and you dont have a backup and you loose the card well you also lose your btc.. think of the debit card like a cold wallet... so you snooze u lose.. you need to be responsible using btc, if you do not want people to control you through the money they control in your cards and wallet then bitcoin is for you but you need to be your own bank and you will reap the benefits in the long term

@_date: 2014-08-27 08:31:27
I like to Forget the transaction part of bitcoin for now. the genious part is the actual protocol behind it and if everyone were to start using btc, Its far better than cash... the momentum of the network is hard to catch with all the money invested into it in regards to alt coins that is, and the fact the devs can add features if worthy enough.  Anyway The reason its acting like a transaction method now is because its early on and ppl need to eat and most grocery shops dont except it yet or what evér industry there is. But what happens when you can buy 90-95% of things with btc this means ppl will not need to change btc to $ they will store it and use it buy food, materials or re-stock the shops shelves then it eventually will become more stable as this is another important factor. we dont need alt coins when btc can do the same thing but have a better backed network.
Then we will have things like: smart contracts, multi sig contracts, coloured coins etc.
Btc is like programmable trustless tranparent ledger with its first feature being money "programmable money infact" all this is where i sèe the value.. by calling it something equivalent to a money order is extremely under-evaluating it and means you cannot forsee the future pontential of it

If not then we have a real world problem , i can do this with CC, CHEQUE OR DEBIT. The way it is marketted  to the merchants could solve the issue,  explaining that its too hard stop a transaction or reverse it which allows them to take the risk like CC or CHEQUE.......... OR we can reduce the confirm time in  the protocol, by finding a way to keep the same security

Well the UK treats it as Money? So why cant we? Look at some of the positive countries and see how they are treating it, why did AUS decide to join the small group of fkd up countries They could have twisted it in the way as Follows: ANYTHING which is not a currency from Australia is considered Foreign currency, which puts BTC in this category. But they decided to say Because BTC is not adopted by a country we cant use it foreign currency. Absolute BS, they fkd it

Yes i have been using them for 1 month now.. they are part of the big 3..
Igot and cointree are the cheapest but cointree had the edge.. more speedy. Deposits and excellent support etc... you can even pay your bills with btc.. they are awesome.
We nees to help them stay alive because if this tax law comes into place where normal consumers will pay 10% gst just to buy bitcoin.. these exchanges are over.. if you have any legal loopholes or ideas that would potentially save them from charging customers 10%gst in return stay in australia and not shut down.. please let them know about it.. i have given them a few ideas and they were appreciative

My Goodness! Come onn man why dont you ask the world why is it always bitcoiners? We are not all rich with millions in funds just waiting for disasters so we can support them.

The fact that you need to spend electricity and buy hardware to obtain the coin already gives it a figure of what its worth.. hard work is needed to obtain pow coins like bitcoin.. they same way hardwork and resources is used to mine realworld gold... think of it like this if gold grew on trees or it was REALLY easy to get.. i wonder how much it would be worth? Ill leave that questoin for you to ponder about

Wtf is going on here these rulings are fkn messed... all over the place one persons says there great the other says they are bad.. the OZ exchange says all is normal and for most users it will be business as usual. Lol is everyone reading the same ruling? This is getting ridiculous.. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:36:26
This is not accurate.. i stopped mining at 75mh and this was 3 weeks ago when profits were higher in the multipools
 Clevermining was more profits than waffle anyway @ 75mh i was barely making 0.03 per day and this is BEFORE electricity cost. When you minus the electricity costs it was barely 0.02 just not worth it at all. You may aswell just buy btc you will make ROI on the spot lol and dont have to wait 5 months

Someone bought a large amount of btc ... could be as simple as that. The down pressure is definitley still there as you can see price heading back down.
I had a great shock this morning, as you know in AUS btc is more expensive. I saw the price at 462aud then jump to 520 within 1 hr . Now its sitting on 485aud 10 hrs later.... Igot exchange
@_date: 2014-08-22 03:21:51
Fuk that exchange ... how can you trust an exchange that went from 460 to 309 but still had 460 orders to sell .... that was shifty as shit .. if it was the margin shit then no one should support this type of trading until btc is hedged and much larger than it is now

As per ozziecoin he states that gst on btc purchases are only gst applicable if your selling to business meaning us as individuals dont have to Pay?? Scroll up check his comment

Correct.. juet tweet it on his page. Why should ppl buy and spend btc if its easier to use cash as you dont have to buy cash. There needs to be some incentives for the average joe who doesnt care about privacy , security etc they only care about savings and because the merchants are actually saving on fraud, chargebacks,fees. They should pass on the benefits onto the consumer because the more benefits for consumers the more btc customers they get meaning more business.

Get someone with A very high rating . Not a single bit of negative. And then you just need to trust and risk . I think it will be fine if he doesnt want to tarnish his name

Lol.... wasted video... useless!  People who truly cannot see a use for bitcoin are seeing bitcoin in the present.. "the bitcoin that we need to change to $ to feed ourselves or families".. they are not looking at the bitcoin of the future where we dont need to change to $$ because so many ppl accept it, meaning we dont have to change to $ unless we want to pay taxes. We will be Able to buy food , petrol, etc travel internatinally and not need to exchange $$ &gt;&gt;€€ &gt;&gt;££&gt;&gt;¥¥ we will simply have an phone wallet that send them btc wehther we in china vietnam thailand bali usa russia greece lebanon portugal etc.. if you have travelled to a foreign company you will realise how much this will change the way ppl travel and spend.. even if a plumber came to ur house to do a job.. u dont like carrying cash around so u simppy scan qr code and say thank u and bye. Just think about the possibilities that will be in our hand.. we can send money in an envelope with multisig meaning once they receive the post card  they call u and u need both keys to unlock there gift... no middlemen or even corrupt postmen
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:43:10
It will not do a single thing.... the DEMAND has to increase ... meaning many more people have to BUY BITCOIN not just sit there and recieve it .. thats like saying if 50% transfer your money to another wallet it will increase the price
If the publicity works ,  possible! but this is a big risk as it may not do much..

For goodness sakes your comparing bitcoins with doggy tokens.. those things u buy dogfood with.
You know that funny looking play money with a doggy on it which is pronounced 4 differebt ways and looks like something you wouldnt even waste a single cent on.
@_date: 2014-10-02 09:07:44
No you do not need to inflate it, think for a second. The more it gets main stream the more demand making each btc worth more, the only thing that  will happen is 1btc will be divised further and further if demand and price increases but this doesnt mean inflation. In the very very far future having 1btc may mean that you are the wealthy few ... every one will be dealing in millibits or bits because it may end up meaning that 1 satoshi is worth $1... this would mean they will have to add more decimals to allow for fee tx. But this is "IF" it becomes this valuable .

By giving two scenarios . 1 = btc= $60 2 = btc possible beyond 10k.. doesn't seem so balanced.  How about the scenario which is most likely to happen? Btc will go up down up up down up down down up down up up (bubble) (pop) down  up up down up down down up up down up. By this time its 2016 and bitcoin is sitting at $987 per coin and we all think its low as shit because of the previous bubble which took us to $2340 per coin.  And thennnnnnnnn repeat with a base low between $850-990
