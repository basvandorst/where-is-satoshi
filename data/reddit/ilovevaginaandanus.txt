So you like sheep, eh?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:49
Who is to say that you aren't being a sheep right now?
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:53:17
Yeah, I see it now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:53:54
They are also rolling around with their Negro female slaves and focefully impregnating them too.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:27:30
Now that's just what a predatory homosexual sheep would say.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:23:02
Now that's precisely what a sheep would say.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:24:31
Using a metaphor substantiate your posture is like fucking yourself in the asshole with a thorny dildo and hoping people give you money just because you have a tight vagina.

Is some math more artificial than other math? By what measure do you call math artificial?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:04:51
Yeah, sarcasm is not easy to detect.

A better question is "Who opposes regulation" and the answer (I believe) is the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:10:12
No regulation means nothing can be done against (allegations of) inside trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:09:22
Why would you insult us like that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:16:27
I'm sure that your misspelled comment devastated the entire banking community.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:31:05
Don't you agree that the fees are a real problem though?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:06:15
The minute quantum computing becomes feasible, all of bitcoin goes down (as well as traditional online banking etc.).
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:22:01
"Regulated bitcoin" would not be anything like bitcoin. You would lose most of its advantages.

The thins is, Asian 'packages' tend to be quite small. Perhaps you would prefer an African package.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:31:40
What's so funny about the anus though? Is Uranus funny?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:00:41


Still, that energy could be going toward better use.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:11:47
So do you know what 'stable' means?
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:25:44


Are you a prophet?
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:33:13
Right, a long-term visionary would never turn to conventional medicine for his cancer. Long-term visionaries attempt to cure themselves by eating lots of vegetables and dying shortly after.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:40:33
Imagine homosexual rape...
So mining bitcoin doesn't seem so terrible now, does it?
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:35:51


and unusable.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:04:16


Hack after hack after hack after hack beg to differ.


Tulips were valuable too... until they stopped being valuable.


My semen is even more scarce. That doesn't make it valuable.


That's like just your opinion, man. That's pure speculation. I'm not even saying that you're wrong - I'm saying that there is no way to know.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:59:26


Who is to say that the FUDer isn't you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:14:25
You could transport those solar panels etc. relatively easily and use them somewhere else in a better way.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:04:59


Do you know the meaning of the word 'contradiction'?
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:36:47
TIL my penis is dead.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:01:25
You say "I trust math" and I hear "I trust greed".
Fiat currency and the banking system have no less math involved.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:39:16
I can tell, silly sir.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:06:31
Invented by Uranus, probably.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:15:37


The entire world has changed as well. Let us not forget that until quite recently, homosexual behavior (just as an example) was looked down upon. People made it their business to make sure you wouldn't stuff your penis inside another man's asshole. Why? For no reason.
This is truly a brave, new, world.
