that's great, being a former Louisianian that just moved to Texas, I hope nobody gives them any.

after my last experience buying bitcoins I will never use MtGox again. They have withdrawal policies that were set when bitcoins were very high, and don't make sense any more.
Their support are worthless script reading drones. Don't use them.

wtf does being an Athiest have to do with bitcoin mining?
get over it, you don't have to bring it up in every fucking discussion. To think that a lot of athiests get mad when you compare them to fundie christians, but their beliefs are all these two groups of people ever want to talk about!

You can get them using a credit card as the original source, but it seems to take quite a few steps. You can send money online from your credit/debit card through western union. You just have to do that and send money to an exchanger for liberty reserve and then just convert your LR to BTC.

they claim this is fixed now, but it seems to still be going on. I had a transaction yesterday that was affected by this problem, and it finally cleared about 30 minutes ago. I Just fired off another transfer (fuck mtgox's daily transfer limits too) and it looks like i am going to have to put up with the same bullshit again.
damn I can't wait to be done with this round of purchases so I can switch to tradehill

mtgox sucks, you might want to try out tradehill. I am next time I need to buy some BTC.
MtGox has ridiciulous daily transfer limits and their support is bad to say the least.

using such stupid wall street terminiology as calling users "bears" and "bulls" annoys me to no end. Get that shit out of here.
If you need proof that most people who talk about BTC are full of it, just look at the number of people who have been telling anyone who asks a question about mining that its' not worth it and they shouldn't try because the ASICs are going to be here any day and ruin it all. Well I *know* I have been reading this line of shit for at least 3 months and they still haven't shown up. That tells me these people are either 1. naive about the ASIC timeframes (doubtful) or b. spreading misinformation. Which one seems more likely?

leaving out a whole word can never be classified as a "typo"

How is your stupid post any better than an image macro post. It's still stupid bullshit that is clogging up the subreddit. Your whining about it is just as annoying to me as the image macro posts.

a better question is...HOW would they ban it's use? It's designed to prevent such things from happening.

this is different because the Facebook IPO was a stock offering that was sold on the NASDAQ. Bitcoin is nothing more than all of us pointing at it and yelling "Look! it's money!" and some of us have paid us dollars for them.

I have to say I think this whole hubub we've seen about this reddit tip bot is really just more Reddit circlejerking. Everything the author of this post attributes to the tip bot is really just the benefits of bitcoin itself. Bitcoin has already given us a way to install transfer to anyone in the world, why do we need to reproduce that? Especially in a way that seems ripe for abuse via many different attack vectors.
The only problems the tip bot is really solving will be fixed simply by bitcoin becoming more popular. Once bitcoin realizes it's potential everybody will publish their BTC addresses for tipping and such.

When you have a "society" that would collapse when you don't prosecute criminals, then it isn't worth saving.

no comic books are valuable because people think they are, this is entirely different.
