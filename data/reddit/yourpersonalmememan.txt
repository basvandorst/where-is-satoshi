Not even 10 years for know if it can somehow continue this insane 10% up a month.

Your right, anonymous is the correct term, saying untraceable is frankly just wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:33:25
That's a scam just waiting to happen!

He is a greedy asshole who likes media attention. No real reason to believe him. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:14:13
Saying anonymous would be accurate. Saying untraceable is wrong and now I realize that.

I should probably tell him to lay off the fox news

Don't use mycelium for 47.5k worth of bitcoin, buy a Trezor, and keep that key hidden if your life depended on it. If

Legitimate question: how does the federal reserve work.

Could he register under my name? What payment methods does Localbitcoins take? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:47:20
Gotta wait for a reputable exchange to pop up and most people will probably sell off the BCH for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:28:50
He does, why? I know steam takes bitcoins but you can't buy through them as far as I know. He's looking to hodl! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:36:08
If it hit 13k omg!

By Friday, I can see easily 3000+. Tomorrow seems soon.

Nothing will overtake bitcoin, but I can see something like Litecoin being used instead of bitcoin for day to day transactions because of it's lower price. Spending 100 on litecoin and getting 2  Litecoin is much more approachable then spending 100 on bitcoin and getting 0.001 btc

Sounds incredibly flawed and like it's run on bullshit.

Really, hope so!

Coinbase. They charge a flat fee so doesn't cost as much as other exchanges.

Right around 4100, so whenever that was

Probably a shitcoin

Oh, I didn't know it had changed. Thank you for the correction, much appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:37:45
After 72 hours it would throw out, that's to prevent this problem. I think they say forever is because it prevents people from setting a 1sat/b tx and the tx from throw out of the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:27:02
Okay, 96.2 fully supports segwit! Thank you 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:42:24
They definitely should say if tx remains unconfirmed then tx will cancel after 72 hours. Or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:09:48
Why? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:33:04
Before segwit that was true but now fees are so low the literally minimum fee usually gets confirmed quickly because there's nothing else to mine. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:24:26
If your unlucky then could be a max of 72 hours, then the transaction gets thrown out of the mempool or unconfirmed transaction list (basically). 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:11:31
It doesn't split tell November so no exchanges will currently accept it. Coinbase will allow buying and selling after the blocks gain some stability
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:41:16
Very stupid, isn't it? It's impossible for a "stuck" tx to even happen (for more then 72 hours) and I'll glad that safety feature exists.

Kraken can go up too 50k without special request.

Full sw or just the capabilities but not fully enabled yet? On armory. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:06:17
Maybe not then, but still like 30 dollars markup without shipping.

No the 2x split.

Mempool is 4mb, so low! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:46:11
A large markup though. :(
