Like it better than the current logo that resembles fiat , dollars, etc. This looks more tech/future like.
The B with lines looks like some fiat knock off lol

What about not wanting to send private info to exchanges (dam passport?, etc) Are their any exchanges that you can buy BTC without all that verification? (Other than localbtc)
Im Canadian with USD in PayPal. How can i use this to buy bitcoin.

Is their a way to fund a gift card or something with my paypal/usd and use that to fund an exchange like gdax?

I thought about this method! Didn't entertain it because it seemed like a lot of work setting up.. but it might be my only option. Especially if i want to use USD outside of PayPal for what ever reason. Thanks for the input.

My USD is in paypal. Not on a credit card

Same boat as you.. Canadian exchanges suck. I want to use my USD in paypal.

I completely understand the reasoning behind it. I'm more so asking for a work around and not really expecting to use PayPal.  
Something Like " send paypal usd -here- and then send it -here- to buy BTC"
Don't want to convert USD to CAD to buy bitcoins. (Exchange rate sucks)

No problem. My issue isn't with withdrawing BTC. I cant fund any US exchanges with USD using PayPal. I'm not American so i can't use the bank transfer option.
Basically , i want to use my USD in PayPal to buy bitcoin.
