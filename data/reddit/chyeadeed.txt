I'll look into it. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:58:40
Try ethereum.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:11:10
Do I have to pay for this? Where can I check it out.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:41:32
Yeah I recently set up an account with a local bank. They have no fees and is all locally owned. I'll be switching this week. Good timing.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:35:49
That was a hell of a read. Thank you.

This was bound to happen. We were all waiting. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:17
Lmk if you figure it out i accidentaly closed the popup and couldnt read it.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:40:29
What does mix coins mean? Does this make them untraceable?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:19:32
What is super bitcoin? Why are we forking?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:24:52
If not they should be.
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:01:00
How is Eth a scam?
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:58:55
Maybe we should repost this one more time. Just incase.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:39:37
Maybe skip the litecoin.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:11:40
Idk if your joking but that's forsure not legit.

It's the older ones who can't comprehend it. People who can't open a PDF or create a new folder in windows. They still run shit for now. Until they get replaced with a more competent and tech savvy generation that is.
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:20:34
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:46:11
Then Satoshi already knew that. There are privacy coins out there for a reason.
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:09:47
His post history is a goldmine of nonsense.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:59:33
Maybe she isn't worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:53:59
Good idea i think im going to do the same!
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:16:21
No it's just sending Bitcoin to a 3rd party and they pay with a gift card.
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:51:41
If it was controlled by people who run banks. Then why wouldn't the banks just use it now..?
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:57:20
Yeah but you said Bitcoin was the baddie.
@_date: 2019-02-13 15:31:22
Yeah I had a group of guys I work with, that are like 20-30 years older than me, came up to me last week saying. "Hey I heard your Bitcoin guy died!" Looking all smug. Like they just have to find every reason to hate on Bitcoin because they don't understand it.
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:34:15
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:45:06
I second this.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:26:27
Machinist at a tool and die shop. My co workers are mostly anti technology country people. They think im crazy for having money in bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:03:56
You got it. The market is heavily manipulated. Ride the waves. A new wave is coming soon.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:17:55
If dogecoin can sponsor a nascar driver, we can def do this.
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:40:11
You can literally see how much they are holding yourself
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:00:26
Check out a website called moonmath.win
Also when the halvening happens, That means that the amount of bitcoin generated everyday by miners decreases by half. If demand stays the same and supply decreases then the price goes up. That's "supply and demand." DO NOT this as investment advice. The only sure things in life are death and taxes. Just because the supply halves that doesnt mean its guaranteed to increase price. But historically speaking it always has. Do not invest more then you can afford to lose. Also if your interested in crypto in general. Check out ethereum.
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:45:39
People have tried before. It doesnt work. Whales just have too much money.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:48:54
I could be misremembering this but I do think I heard of 'crypto loans' awhile back using Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:13:29
I have a rig with 2 cards mining. A flashed Vega 56 and an RX 470 I get like maybe a little over a dollar a day. I don't really care if I make a huge profit or any at all. Do it if you want but don't expect to get an Roi if your buying new cards.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:22:54
I mean that's at current prices. If (when) it goes back up then you'll be making more.
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:12:07
"According to two people familiar with the matter." Okay.
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:49:24
Amd already has multiple miners.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:02:07
Is this real life?
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:09:45
That's genius. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:16:57
I agree with this statement. I'm sure this is unrealistic. But could we as a subreddit agree to contribute like 5-10 dollars A week on a particular day? Would that even have a noticable effect on price?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:06:11
I bought my first from coinbase a week ago. Everyone pointed me to gdax afterwords. Coinbase is a good place to start though
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:42:56
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:50:56
Arent the nodes it runs on hand selected by the devs? I think nano is cool but its fast because it isnt decentralized.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:17:34
I see. So they rotate the nodes they use every so often to avoid using the same ones over and over again?
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:15:04
Check out compound.finance, maker cdp, and God's unchained. There's more to crypto then just spending it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:17:21
I would steer clear of litecoin. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the best IMO. Do your research. Dont buy shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:16:15
Didnt know that thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:21:46
16k as the prophecy has fortold.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:46:50
The devs forked to save a bunch of people's funds after a hack. Gets a lot of hate for that. But it has the most developers by a landslide and you can already do a lot of stuff with it besides just HODL and wait to get rich like bitcoin. (I own both 70/30 bitcoin/ether)
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:17:40
Not sure what I made you "click through". But I'm just letting people know this BS is getting sent to people's phones now.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:34:25
We need more crypto gandalf.
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:55:06
What usb miner are you using?
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:24:16
Got em.
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:50:55
Seems plausible.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:03:09
From stores such as Target? No. But in this situation you're just converting Bitcoin to a USD gift card... Why not just use USD and skip the Bitcoin aspect all together. It doesn't make sense to me. This is just a more complicated way to buy a gift card.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:52:38
I really do appreciate the willingness to bear my btc burden. But seriously the chart and everything is gone from my app. Just weird.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:43:30
More like spend Bitcoin for Target gift cards.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:59:53
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:47:05
But that's not Vegeta.
