I feel like a leader will emerge per type/use case.  There will eventually be numerous successful cryptos with good adoption IMO, but not necessarily many that are primarily intended for the same use/market.

Bitcoin ATMs still exist to serve people that have no idea where else to acquire them or aren't interested in learning about exchanges.  A good example might be a 65 year old that still uses a flip phone and doesn't have an email address. 
Getting money from an ATM is something that's familiar to everyone, so they're geared towards serving a very specific type of person.  In exchange for providing a familiar purchase vehicle, they tend to charge massive fees and make huge profits per transaction.

I hate to say it, but 4 Bitpay card holders that OP knows + all the people in the comments saying they have fraudulent charges means that Bitpay was almost certainly compromised.  Whether it was a hack or poor PCI compliance procedures, it doesn't matter.  Your money is not safe there right now.

I did as well, just shy of 7,500.

Topped off BTC at sub 7500, then shifted to a stablecoin at around 9650 last night.  Waiting for the market to drop and stabilize to re-enter at a better position

If a phishing campaign or credential reuse netted the bad guys plaintext cardholder data, then it's due to horrendously negligent PCI compliance practices.  Unfortunately, there are too many instances just in the comments below for it to be a single vendor or merchant.
Coming from someone that was the lead systems engineer at the largest payment processor in the world (at the time), I can say that there are extremely strict requirements for storing and/or transmitting any cardholder data and there should never be a situation where a compromised account (or even multiple accounts or an admin account) leads directly to this type of data, especially in plain text.  The attack vector could have been a phishing campaign or a set of credentials getting out, so you're correct about that, but that alone shouldn't have led to this type of data. 
I'm obviously just speculating here and have no clue what actually happened, but cardholder data is definitely out one way or another, unfortunately.

I'm far from an expert on Lightning, but it has to do with nodes running transactions off-chain for speed, then ultimately syncing back up to the chain.

First and foremost, I'm glad to hear most of your coins are recovered.  
The thing about Lightning that worries me is related to your advice   It seems that any time your physical node shits itself with channels open and not synced, there's a decent chance you lose your funds.  That sounds like a pretty crazy risk to take and a pretty crazy stipulation to release the technology with. 
The fact that people are running nodes in their basements without at least a UPS is batshit insane and just shows that not everyone is ready for this type of thing.  The fact that a power outage or host failure can lose your money is a flaw with the technology.  As is the case with any tech, you have to design safe-guards to protect people from themselves, especially when your intentions are to go large scale.
