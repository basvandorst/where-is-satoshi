1. Excepy when the person who wants to pay only has Bitcoin that they want to spend. Also, easier than what? This is essentially already done by third party services. Vendors just sign up for an account and copy paste some code to their site's payment page.
2. Ok, you're one of those "I have nothing to hide people." So? You're not everyone. Again, like I said, the fees are there regardless of if you hit them so I'm not wrong.
3. You can make less than inflation by putting USD in your bank account. You seem to be unfamiliar with rates of inflation vs return. You can't put bitcoin in a bank account yet.
4.  You seem to not realize that all of these things are actively being developed which is why everyone is so excited and speculation is running wild.
5. A card can be used to transact in bitcoins.

Come on, the name of the place is "sheep marketplace." You can often learn a lot about a place by its name. I learned that in particular about law enforcement who has a habit of "cleverly" naming criminal facing sting components.
If I was buying stuff from these black marketplaces I would only operate on very tiny marketplaces. The big ones are always going to fuck you somehow. Either the government, the operators, the vendors, or the customers are going to fuck you.

Pretty much since the start. Don't worry too much, even among early adopters keeping a file thats "worth" $1 is very difficult. I remember being able to get like 1/10th of a Bitcoin with my gaming computer in only a couple hours or something. At the time, that was laughable.
I think at most I ever had like 3-5 bitcoins and I accidentally formatted the computer the wallet was in. I even immediately realized I had done it, and could have recovered it then, but was like.. fuck it, its $1 and this shit is stupid anyway. I'm not trying to buy any drugs on the internet.
Then awhile later I went and bought some bitcoin to pay for server hosting on a "bulletproof" Chinese server for SEO purposes. Guess what happened to the remainder of those coins? Same thing, lost it because I didn't care to save the remaining coins after I had successful conducting my transactions.

I believe you're referring to wear leveling. In this case, you can erase the data using ATA Secure Erase functionality on the drive.

I'm saying what computer is it that you think you're doing this sneaky stuff on. Whats the difference between doing this on a PC you own vs PC x? Are you implying its some kind of hacked computer you intend to remotely wipe the drive of?

It is possible to selectively route certain applications over a VPN. However, its difficult to setup if you're not technically savvy. The most common home solution would probably be setting up a *nix system to use as a gateway so you can make more complex ACLs via iptables. For example, pfSense is a BSD based router that could do application level VPN tunnels.
You can run VPN software on an individual computer that will send all traffic over the VPN tunnel, or you can use a VPN tunnel at your gateway to send all traffic from all devices on the network that is leaving your local network over the VPN. These are the two most common examples for home use but there are other configurations.

I was thinking a bit about what a bitcoin bank might look like. Do you think we'll see a return to paper banking in a bizarre twist? So far it seems like almost everyone is failing to properly secure bitcoins in that larger sense.

Um.. what? I can't believe you're bringing Bayesian statistics into a discussion about the existence of God.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:02:36
Its right in the definition. I can't help it that atheists often can't understand words that have multiple definitions. My original statement is in response to someone stating that God definitely does not exist. That falls under a doctrine that there is no deity, not a disbelief in dieties.
noun: doctrine; plural noun: doctrines
    1.
    a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a church, political party, or other group.
Thus we see that if you make statements that God does not exist, you simply have a religious doctrine, just like anyone who says God does exist. Atheist means more than one thing.

Thats silly, the whole point of bitcoins is to use them, not be depressed about about using them. Being depressed sucks but this isn't a good reason. I hope you feel better in the future.

First of all, I would suggest you take a look at your priorities. You want to make speculative investments when you don't even have a car yet? Uhh..
Second, you stop being such a pussy and realize its your money and you can do whatever you want with it.

1. Merchants are instantly converting BTC to other currencies avoiding any fluctuations. All they have to do is peg BTC item prices to a dynamic value based one exchange rates.
2. You can instantly exchange bitcoin/cash using localbitcoins.com. Your debit card is tracked by your bank and there are bank fees in order to obtain one (regardless of if you hit those fees or not).
3. No one said the intent of bitcoin is making money. Once price is normalized/stable you won't be making money by just having bitcoin, just like you don't make money by having USD (unless deflation which bitcoin has built in).
4. If you have no money there is probably a reason why and getting that credit card might be harder than you imagine. Besides, what does a credit card indicate? A balance in owed value to a loaner. You can just as easily provide a bitcoin credit card.
5. Using bitcoin to shop online is one of the easiest experiences you can have. You don't have to sign into PayPal, enter your credit card, etc. You just copy the unique address for your purchase and enter that with the total into your bitcoin wallet and click send.
6. Again, why can't you have a bitcoin card?
It doesn't matter that the average person doesn't see why to use bitcoin. A large part of the drive right now is its decentralized and anonymous nature. Thousands of people already use bitcoin to conduct transactions and they do it in bitcoin for very specific reasons.

I'm saying that you completely misconstrued everything I said to fit your stereotype of a strawman you could tear down to satisfy your own doubts.
When I said "near the tailend" it refers to existing bitcoin history, not some theoretical max value.
I also am not telling him to "give it away," I suggested he donate some to charity to alievate his obsession over becoming wealthy by owning bitcoins. Something it sounds like you might be obsessing over as well.

The difference is that the printing of bitcoin is done by the private industry. An individual can create bitcoin by "solving" a math problem, thats all it takes and then suddenly they own bitcoin.
Conversion to other currencies and any fees involved is irrelevant. Theres also nothing to stop inidividuals from trading directly.
The value here is that there is no international money between individuals. I can't go to a website and buy Yuan from someone a few miles away. I can't take the Yuan and go to Russia and easily find someone wanting to exchange it for Rubles. Only exchanges make this convenient and they take a large cut because they have no interest in the transaction, they just want to be a middleman for their percentage.
Exchanges will exist for bitcoin too but the difference is they aren't even really the best option. People are realizing that as time goes on and more exchanges are subjected to frozen funds by governments and so on. Just trade with your neighbor.

You can convert instantly from BTC to USD on transaction using bitpay from what I understand.
Of course you should put a sign up. ;)

Its right in the definition of atheism actually.

Every single day there are opportunities such as your imagined fantasy investment into bitcoin. They just occur in places you don't see them and they aren't publicized like bitcoin since its such a novel thing.
You sound like you're in kind of a manic state due to a combination of being involved near the tail end, probably making some money, and the constant media attention over the past couple weeks (meaning stories are actually being written for you to obsess over).
I would suggest giving away some of your bitcoin to a charity or something to reverse your obsessive desire to own any tiny piece you can.
Also I chose to delete dozens of bitcoins years ago. Its partially because all of the people at the start of bitcoin threw away their wallets that the prices went up recently. There is a 99.99999% chance you would have been one of the other people, like myself, who intentionally deleted their wallet without a care in the world.
..and you know what? I still don't care. I even knew the price was going to spike from $120 to $1000 plus and didn't buy in, couldn't care less. Money isn't everything and its quite easy to obtain if you obsess over it.

Yes, but your parents can open one with you. It shouldn't be difficult to convince them to open an account for you so you can put your money in the bank and then you can do whatever you want.

There was a Defcon talk about encoding images and text into the blockchain to preserve it indefinitely. Really cool talk about a really smart guy who commited suicide shortly before. I could try to find it if there is enough interest.

I would create a bootable Clonezilla USB stick, boot into Clonezilla on a computer that has the drive attached, and then clone that drive. Now you'll have an image file that I'm fairly certain you'll be able to do a basic "file recovery" type search on with free open source tools. Another possibility is to boot into a Live CD type environment, or install the disk in a computer next to a working bootable hard drive, and use the same tools on the hard drive that way.
Basically you should start with what you can do on your own. When you pay $3,000 its because they're going to do the Clonezilla step like I described and then they're either running custom software or manually trying to find a wallet file specifically.
After mounting the image or booting a Live CD with disk at /dev/hda this command would output a list of recoverable file names from the disk and display any of them named "wallet.dat."

Sure, how much equity do I get in your company?
Edit: Also I'd be very curious why you got a round of funding from a VC presumably but they aren't interested in continuing. The whole point of VC funded startup rounds is to allow the VC to back off at any point if things aren't going well. So, why did they back off?
