The definition of a economist is a person who can tell you tomorrow why his prediction from yesterday didn't come true today.

Yeah but most titty bars aren't fans of you having your phone or really anything with a camera out. I think it's best just to keep it simple and print a whole bunch of 1mbtc paper wallets and do it the old fashion way. No need to over engineer this.

 id like to point out that right now the time is 1:55 A.M. CST on a weekday. it stands to reason that a large chunk of North American traders are asleep or not following the market at the moment and the day is just starting in Europe. Draw whatever conclusion you want but the evidence is there that a large chunk of these trades are likely coming from Japan from someone or some group that thinks they know something we don't yet

Thanks for sharing that write up. I'm glad I found a way to contribute to the bit coin community besides just buying coins. So far I have about 200MB of block chain downloaded and 22GB to go and my raspberry pi still performs its file sharing and HD video streaming duties flawlessly. bitcoind currently takes about 60%-90% of the cpu time so be aware of that if you want to run other cpu intensive services on the pi and it took about 3 1/2 hours to compile so be ready to wait until you can start using it.

I'm going to assume this is why my gold/ silver guy only takes cash and doesn't write receipts . That said I've never sold 10 oz of gold (the amount required for them to have to send a 1099 to the irs) before so I'd be interested in seeing how that would play out.

I've bought a little in the mid and high $700 range but most of my coins where bought in the $500-$600 range. I keep my savings split between BTC gold silver a 401k and my companies employee stock purchase plan. Right now I have most of my money in a 5BTC paper wallet, plus I keep a small spending wallet with about 0.25 in it to promote spending btc. I plan on not touching the wallet until December when I will have had bit coin for a year to see how the market plays out and decide what to do with the money at that point.

Sorry if this is shameless self promotion. i finally have completed my first software project good enough for other people to use. The web design is pretty ugly and I'm sure their are still bugs i haven't discovered yet in there (along with a few minor things with how the page displays that i don't want to mess with fixing right now) but it is usable at this point. All you have to do to try it out is create a user tell it what your main bitcoin wallet (public key) is and how much silver and gold you have (if any) and it will give you a read out of exactly what it's all worth at the current market prices.

looks like it could drop under $200 within the hour

what it dose is it allows you to create a user that you can save the amount of gold and silver you have and a primary bitcoin public key that you keep a majority of your coins in like a paper wallet or something like that. when ever you log in it pulls the data that you provided and goes out and gets the current gold and silver spot price and bit coin exchange rate from coinbase as well as how many coins you have at that address from blockchain.info and tells you what your holdings in gold/silver and bitcoin are worth both individually and in total as well has how much each has gone up or down in value since the last time you logged in.
