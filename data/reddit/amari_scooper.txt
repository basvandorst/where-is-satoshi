Gemini will let you deposit USD and you can instantly begin trading. You just can't withdraw until the deposit clears which takes like 4-5 days in my experience. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:38:19
You say that as ETH is taking losses.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:00:35
Brian Armstrong gave up on Bitcoin a while ago. He's been backing Ether heavy.

China is apparently going to stop buying US treasuries so we might get a chance to find out sooner rather than later. Also, for people that don't know, that isn't the end of the world. It could possibly just result in a market downtrend. It could also do nothing at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:30
It's still dropping
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:05
It's just a running joke that started as a typo but now is kind of an official term for taking a long position on coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:13:39
Fuck your grandma. Then buy more Bitcoin and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:51:08
That sub reads like r/T_D 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:43:22
I actually agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:37:27
Yeah it has con artists behind it instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:33:19
That thought might be too rational for this market to be completely honest.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:45:51
Their system is being overloaded. The trading volume is insane right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:26
A lot of people are saying it's a coordinated attack from BCash holders selling off mass quantities of BTC holdings. Idk if it's that sinister but BCH is climbing. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:26:12
They hold it in a single wallet though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:13
Some of the exchanges can generate transaction reports for you. I know that if you use Libra tax, you can upload those reports and it will create a tax report for you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:22
Because the exchanges aren't connected. It's like shopping at different stores. The prices aren't always going to be the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:45:47
No they're trying to co-opt an existing brand. It would be like if I opened a fast food restaurant and called it McDonalds Junior. I'm getting free built in name recognition without doing any of the work. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:49:30
Unless there was a collective government ban on exchanges, wouldn't Bitcoin most likely recover from any bubbles bursting? Like if hypothetically Bitcoin crashed over the next couple of months wouldn't you consider trying to buy back in at the ground floor and riding it back up? Or do you think a major crash would kill crypto altogether?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:23:51
Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size and isn't as prone to the backlog of transactions to be verified like Bitcoin. Roger Ver is the most prominent Bitcoin Cash backer and he says that it does what Bitcoin was made to do better than Bitcoin by acting as a peer to peer system. You can go on and on about the debate and ideologies behind the two but at the moment I side with Bitcoin Core just because I don't like Roger Ver and all the people foaming at the mouth at r/BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:08
They'll go live again. You have to remember that these exchanges don't have decades of high volume trading to build off of. Just months ago the volume of trading was significantly lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:17:45
What account?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:01
where'd you sell at? Anywhere near that 19k mark? Because that might be the best move I've seen in a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:34:10
Holy shit, those people all have total Star Wars names. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:15:01
No one knows but I don't think anyone here is going to tell you that you're making a mistake. Just hodl and and hope for the best. Plus I'm assuming your $300 isn't going to make or break you
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:08
Still a nice move. Good luck, my guy
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:27
It's always viable. It's just not going to magically make you rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:26
Yeah the core developers have chosen to maintain the status quo and  have the lightning network as a second layer solution. I'm pretty sure when it comes down to it, the choice to not increase the block size is done to maintain a consistent backlog as an incentive on the mining side. Not everyone agrees with it. I'm not knowledgeable enough on the technicals to really weigh in. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:11
It's a fire!! ^^sale
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:56
The profit on each trade is taxable, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:04:14
It didn't stay above 19k very long so that's a pretty good play, my guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:43
It's like asking if it's going to rain on your wedding day when you aren't even dating anyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:41:52
I don't get how anyone can listen to a word Roger Ver says without their eyes rolling out of their head. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:45:03
It's why I find it extra weird that Roger Ver wants to talk about it so much. He's always like r/bitcoin is censoring posts and this and that. I'm just like "you mean that subreddit where people are constantly shitposting memes and talking about how they just bought $20 worth of bitcoin?"
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:25
Not trying to get doxxed
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:23:00
Then you buy BCash. It's the fundamental argument that Roger Ver is making by calling BCash the real Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:57:20
If Bitcoin hits 100k next year........I'll be very pleased and maybe buy myself something nice. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:20:48
They claim they're the truly decentralized currency though
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:00:08
As much irony as there is saying that in the comments of this post, you're not wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:19
Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:27:41
But, think about the dotcom boom. All of these bullshit websites exploded in value and then most of them failed, but look at Amazon for example. They survived and became a massive global enterprise. If cryptocurrency is "doomed to the same fate", who is to say that Bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other coins can't survive the burst and even grow from there?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:30:50
Can we not? I'd rather think of crypto as the Martin Luther to fiat's Catholic Church. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:06
Financial sovereignty doesn't mean that the government needs to be overthrown. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:11:50
There are a lot of scummy companies but most of them don't go around blaming black people for their shitty sales. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:07:09
They're in there circlejerking about how Kim Dotcom is backing Bitcoin Cash. That alone is enough for me to stay away. That guy is fucking cancer. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:43:53
The FBI holds the largest bitcoin wallet in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:54:17
They're absolutely terrified of the average person having any sort of control over their financial future. It's hilarious watching them squirm. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:59:42
I told my mom about Bitcoin and she wants to write me a check so I can buy some for her. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:53:32
It's people in their 60's who sit at home with their dogs and watch The Big Bang Theory. I know this because my mom does this and so do her friends. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:16:38
I've heard that but I also heard that they just dispersed the coins to make it seem like they did. Idk too much about it. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:02:13
I agree. Don't give Roger the attention he wants. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:34:08
Do you?
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:59:36
If you lost over 2 million dollars worth of anything, I think the last thing you would do is turn to reddit. I'd be going on a rampage right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:39:37
Warren Buffett is extremely risk averse. It would be shocking if he ever got behind Bitcoin. Gates is in the tech world so he likes the underlying concepts of Bitcoin. It's so pointless to even talk about them like this. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:54:46
Your critical thinking skills are basement level. Holy shit, the American education system has failed you. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:56:38
"I just had over $2 million stolen from me. No big deal though. Just don't let it happen to you guys! :)"
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:20:42
And people need to be smart about it. If you're mortgaging your house to buy bitcoin then you're fucking up. But if you're throwing a few thousand dollars from your rainy day fund into bitcoin then it's an exciting investment opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:11:45


It's as simple as that. If you had $6,000 in cash you wouldn't just give it to your best friend to hold onto even if you did have trust in them. Anything could happen to it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:04:08
Hmm I was wondering what the Good Boy Points to Bitcoin conversion was
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:28:28
It's mostly just for fanciness and the UI. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:54:04
Unless you're trying to retire within the year, you can afford to wait. People are just terrified of seeing losses. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:16:59
The article is a little hyperbolic but I would suggest diversifying either way. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:07:10
The stock market is taking a shit too.
