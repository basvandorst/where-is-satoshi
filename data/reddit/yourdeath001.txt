Well I only used Bitpay because they offer that card where you convert bitcoin to USD instant from ATM, guess I am not doin that anymore.
What about Copay, same shit?
What phone wallets do you recommend?

So basically whether funds are confirmed are not does not matter, but the less money you have the more you lose?

Loved Samourai. Now my next question is what website do you use to cash out bitcoin to USD into your bank account? I use Glidera and love it.

No I meant I sent my last $1800 from circle to my bank before they banned me, so nothing circle can do to stop the transaction now right? Like am I good or can they cancel the transaction mid transfer and keep my money?

So do you think I will be able to get my processed money to my bank or now that they have closed my account, they can somehow stop the transaction and keep my $1800? lol

You live and you learn, I did not think they kept tabs on this kind of shit, but I know for the future.
Thanks for the help bro!

Well when I transfer to a personal wallet, they don't have the option of sending to my bank, so how can I transfer the money from personal wallet to my bank? Bitcoin atm? (26 minutes away lol)

shieeeet alright man, but they have no right if they decide to ban me to take my money no matter where I got it from wtf, but lets hope it reaches my bank or I'm fucked.

No, that's why I came here asking for sites and you are the first one to let me know of these, do they offer low fees?
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:38:04
oh okay okay thanks

Fuck... What about Kraken as someone else has mentioned?
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:48:00
I did not keep it I already withdrew the money 2 days ago and its in processing and it told me that I shall receive it by December 1st. My balance was $0 when they banned me so fuck them. However, can they cancel the payment mid processing? If they already issues the payment I don't think they can stop it just because I got banned??

So what about sending from Gambling site &gt; Phone wallet &gt; Exchange wallet such as Kraken? Can that trace as well or ??????
