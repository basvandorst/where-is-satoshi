You: hammer
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:38:22
Just because you dont know for 100% certain doesn't mean you cant make educated guesses.  Bitcoin will most likely test the 200 mark again as it flirts with a double button.  Where it goes from there is uncertain.  Dont try to predict the trends but learn to ride them up or down.  You get that right you will most certainly profit.
@_date: 2015-01-09 04:18:33
yeah they might sell like 5 of them
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:40:20
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:20:44
Because WU pays apple for placement if that isnt obvious to you.

I sold it all around 700.  So glad i did!
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:23:17
You dont need to buy a second hand D430.  Just remove the HD and use something like this: 
Plug it in to a computer (offline if youre super paranoid) and search for "wallet.dat". If you find it, instant bitcoins.  Good luck.

Nobody cares

Ouch that stinks. So glad i got out early
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:40:07
Cool idea but act fast. A pizza might cost you a whole BTC in a few days!

@_date: 2015-01-13 04:19:45
Guess it depends on how you measure success. If your standard is existence then i guess bitcoin is a success.

@_date: 2015-01-24 04:17:49
I can't wait until bitcoin is mainstream enough that every little shot hole business doesn't post that they "take bitcoin" on reddit.

Who keeps their btc on blockchain.info anyways?...idiots.
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:45:50

Oh i think i read about this is in "nobody cares magazine"
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:50:09
pretty much accurate 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:37:12
...and why it's actually GOOD for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:25:46
Good idea until your bank looks into the transaction, sees it's bitcoin related and suspends your account.
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:08:54
obviously anyone who questions anyone who is pro bitcoin is wrong...right cult...i mean sub.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:50:29
You are EXACTYLY why bitcoin will never be adopted by the mainstream. I assume you want the price to not be zero yeah? Does it matter then?
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:47:57
Problem appears to be fixed.  Very impressed with the developers rapid response! Great job guys
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:02:28

@_date: 2015-01-16 16:07:45
no way 1 million people use bitcoin!

If you use this obvious scam site then you deserve to get scammed.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:05:42
Should the person who invested &gt;5k on the machine give away bitcoin for free?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:10:49
It will most likely test the $200 level
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:33:05
No. Don't do it.  Even with free electricity there are no profitable miners on the market.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:16:35
This is actually GOOD for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:25:16
0.2 btc is NOT a lot of money.  If its a lot to you, you probably shouldnt be buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:16:10
Cool so how much money have you lost in the 24 hr?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:46:11
Not true at all.  Cex.io just shut down their could mining. Hashrate has dropped about 15% in the last 24 hours.  We are much closer to the "break even" point than most may think.

Just because its an amazing idea doesn't mean its going to be a success.

According to slush.  Satoshi labs seems unaware of this problem.  This is very concerning...
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:10:03
Haha i sold all by btc when it was &gt;700.  Just an observer at this point.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:48:19


@_date: 2015-01-31 23:13:02
Just becuase you believe in bitcoins doesnt mean you need to hold the bag while people are shorting. You wont wake up one day and see the price rise to 10k from 200.  The rise if any will most likely relatively gradual. You'll still have plenty of opportunities to buy.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:06:36
Another way of looking at: If people are willing to pay +15% then bitcoin must really be in demand.  Youve disproved your own point.  Way to go OP
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:19:16

@_date: 2015-01-31 02:05:05

@_date: 2015-01-19 23:22:07
In other words...piss off
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:35:59
Because a lot of bitcoins supporters are losing a lot of money. This should be a concern as it raisers the barrier for future adoption.

thats not as profound as you think

I'm sure 99% of people on this sub would claim that too
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:57:19
Mining is very profitable.  That is why everyone does it and everyone is rich.  
@_date: 2015-04-11 20:00:53
I say go for it dude! Dont let the haters talk you out of it!

What makes you think it will hit $1000?!
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:40:39
Yes i have used before.  100% safe
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:15:46

@_date: 2015-02-07 17:52:11
Coinbase is just fine. Their vault is very easy to set up and works great.
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:25:17
Calm down. Just asking for everyones take.

Not really. Id say most people on this sub own way less than 1 btc
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:18:38

Mycelium now uses HD wallets so you can recover your wallet on your new phone by using the seed you were given when you backup your HD wallet.  If you havent yet done this make sure you backup ASAP.  When you are on your wallet balance page hit the menu button on your phone and select "backup".  You will receive the key which you can use to import your wallet into your new phone.

Remember the ONLY way to keep your bitcoins safe is something something umbutu live cd...something something...paper wallet...something something.  If you dont do this your bitcoins will be hacked and stolen!!!

Bitcoin QT and local bitcoins are the 2 worst.  ANYTHING else would be better.
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:15:28
Sorry, thats not true
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:41:41
What is the point of this?
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:05:53
Security perceptions are becoming a really issue. Anyone new to bitcoin who reads this sub would be seriously concerned about security.  Why would anyone hold a currency that is so easy to steal/hack?

You shouldnt demand that a company do a certain thing.  If you dont like their business practices, simply use their competitor.  Free market baby!
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:29:02
This is actually GOOD for bitcoin

If you think these companies are going to put R&amp;D dollars into bitcoin hardware youre living in a dream world.

Bitcoin market cap: ~3.1 billion USD
Cost of 30 second super bowl commercial: ~4.5 million USD
4.5 million / 3.1 billion x 100 = 0.1%

Run on sentence fail bro.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:39:57
Depending on scale, we still could be very close to the "peak". Keep that in mind.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:03:16
What are you 18? Nobody here really cares about your whining.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:24:50
They offered a refund so they are hardly f**king you over. Nobody in this sub wants to hear your whining.
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:38:27
Great analogy.  I back up all my cash with a 12 seed key in safe of theft/loss too.

You will have a neg balance and paypal will send your account to collections.  Huge hassle and will harm your credit.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:27:24
nobody cares man sorry
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:54:44
Notice how youre only getting downvotes...interesting huh?

If you've already entered your pin on your trezor you are not asked for it again before additional transactions until the device is disconnected and reconnected.  
If youre having trouble on chrome try clearing your cache.  This has worked for me when i've had similar problems.

Will a 280x run far cry 4 well?
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:43:38
Whats your average cost per bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:37:45
Your are very close to 100% safe.  There has never been a confirmed loss of coins from a non-rooted android phone using mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:12:03
Cash out!
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:35:18
Thanks for making me rich r/bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:31:58
He's right in the fact that the average person should NOT be investing in bitcoin at this time if their only goal is a return on that investment.

The only people that fear education are those that have never had any.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:08:30
He obviously means btc to fiat
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:21:56
Works fine for me
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:00:21


Source? Historically ASIC tech has increased faster than GPUs in term of hashrate.  New asics have been coming out every few months where as the product cycle for the top GPUs have been on the order of years.

This is actually GOOD for bitcoin!

Wow 90 total votes.  Nice sample size
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:25:36
Why do you think its not?
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:52:48
Yes you obviously did
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:28:29
If you think these are similar cases you're an idiot.
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:15:12


Incorrect.  Current version does still do this.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:11:35
Dude, this is just pathetic.
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:18:04


I didnt i said it would perhaps rise.  Nothing is certain.  Also "large events" dont really drive the price that much anymore. The ONLY thing that will drive they price up is people buying bitcoin...its that simple.
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:03:06
He was just asking a simple question he made no mention of expecting or being owed anything. Your irrelevant personals views add nothing and no one here cares to read them.
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:33:31


You obviously didnt go to a univeristy in the US
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:33:54
Really professional 
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:21:10
Cool now you can use her credit card to buy more bitcoin! To the moon!
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:50:57
Its sad to think that some people actually feel like this is a possibility. US could outlaw bitcoin tomorrow if it wanted to.  It would be fun to watch the price plummet!
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:51:38
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:25:55
Mine isnt working either! Hope its not another hack!
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:31:26
Sorry man, wont happen
@_date: 2015-02-01 05:07:34
Youre totally right! The reason people dont just give their money away is before bitcoin it was just too hard.
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:51:26
Google HD wallets dude.  Thats the non-circle jerk answer/truth
