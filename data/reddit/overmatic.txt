I was under the impression that is how it's suppose to work. I have no idea what this shit is or why would anyone use it when you can accept payments directly anyway.

You're kidding yourself if you don't believe bitcoin would be rolled back If a good chunk of the supply was hacked.  
Every user and exchange that was affected would want it done and their voices would out number the few who protest the rolling back.

We don't care about the tech problems anymore bruh we only care about the price bruh.

Mt Gox was before anyone cared about it and BFX wasn't that massive, users received their money back so no fuss from them.
I would also argue Mt Gox users were led to believe they were getting their coins back and are still in the process of getting them back.
If millions of bitcoins were hacked from multiple exchanges and hundreds of thousands of users at once and there was no way to pay users back it would be rolled back.

Maybe one day Apple produces super quantum computers for 20 bucks and maybe one day Microsoft releases windows 5000 an operating system that can read your mind to compete with Apple but still many will never own either stock or care about owning any even though people tell them about the stock price day after day.

For some reason the exchange allows people to buy pennies worth of bitcoin but it won't allow them to sell less than 0.01 ($114.91) bitcoin though. 
I don't think they thought this all the way through or updated the allowed buy sell amounts since bitcoin went from 200 to over 10,000.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:55:48
Don't feel bad. I was duped by people saying eth was just another alt coin at 10 bucks and forks are bad, and the blockchain is too big and it is doomed. I missed out big time.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:23
because looking at previous steep climbs like this and ignoring the fact some of them fully retraced the entire climb is not a smart thing to do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:23:19
Bitcoin can be compared to stocks, commodities and currency. The majority of people buying are speculating on future returns and the hopes that more and more buy it up so their digital coin they speculated on rises in price. Same thing with stocks. Most see it as a investment not a method of payment.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:31:46
I''m not sure what effect it might have. I think traders follow futures so if futures says up it might go up and if it says down it might go down.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:00:22
Which I believe buys or sells it directly off the exchange and that is why fees are high to make up for any movement in the spread.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:43
This. The fees are sometimes insane.  If i had $3000 or less I'm not sure I would invest it in btc short term. The gains are too small for me now trading short term.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:02:34
Many reasons. It's not some crystal ball or magic power they have it's more about price action and volume. They are not always right just like the people that think it will reach a certain price are not always right.
Usually when people say it needs to correct it's their instincts telling them that it is getting too risky to buy or hold at a certain price because the rally has slowed down and there are less and less buyers and more and more sellers coming into the mix.  
 
In the end nobody is 100 percent certain a rally continues or ends and nobody wants to be the guy who bought a top for years to come or sold too early. Otherwise if everyone was 100 percent certain something would happen everyone would invest more than can afford to lose.

I received it too.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:52:59
Yeah they sent it as "**URGENT:Bitcoin changes may affect your account here are your options**"
They also tell users **the only way to avoid potential negative consequences of a bitcoin fork is to not hold bitcoin** and then instructs users how to convert their bitcoin balance to dollars, euros and pounds.
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:31:18
How does the smart bitcoins work? In the video it says send bitcoin to address in exchange for smart bitcoins. Does this mean there is no need for an exchange and the smart bitcoins are really just bitcoins on another blockchain and can be exchanged back and forth seamlessly? Meaning 1 smart bitcoin = 1 regular bitcoin? I'm trying to visualize how this works. Or is there no such thing as a smart bitcoin in the sense of another token, is it really just a balance sheet of bitcoins who committed value to smart contracts running along side the bitcoin network? Meaning there really is no second token and smart bitcoins are bitcoins? Or is it a mash-up  of the two concepts?

What is taking so long to fix the problems bitcoin has now? Where is this Lightning Network shit everyone keeps talking about? I keep hearing about this block size shit going on over 2 years now. Surely it shouldn't take this fucking long to implement something reasonable. its open source software after all. 
Maybe both sides of the debate are just fucking around.

Really this is what you're upset about? A comedy show making a 3 second joke about Bitcoin and its many forks also called Bitcoin something? Maybe he didn't see the logo the graphic department put on the screen, Maybe it was a jab at the entire Bitcoin fork drama and they wanted to get a response. Maybe they don't follow crypto news and see every little detail. But who really cares though?
Sounds like many of you are more upset with his politics than the joke and the joke is a excuse for you to vent your political leanings.

That is like saying home buyers and house flippers taking out massive loans at top of the 2006 housing bubble still received back their purchase price or made a profit. Many of those homes were foreclosed on and ended up at auctions at rock bottom prices. All that value that was moved around in the process simply didn't exist when it came time to cash in. It was a made up number.

I can say I use bitcoin more than other types of online payments. 
I buy gift cards on gyft a few times a month, amazon and restaurant gift cards( so many birthdays and holidays in a year). I sports bet almost every week on nitrogensports, directbet and bovada. Depending on the lines offered. 
And of course I hold bitcoin so i can show people in real life what I'm talking about. 
I think a big thing that could happen for bitcoin is if Bitpay could get a site like netflix or hulu to accept bitcoin. It only takes one major site that offers subscriptions to accept it then the dominoes will fall. What I would really like is a way to pay to watch live sports with bitcoin. I would gladly pay a pro sports league or network for a HD sports game stream that doesn't lag or have pop ups. subscription or pay per game with bitcoin.

I might have to check it out then and look over the source code. *It does look like the closest fit for what I want to see on the desktop.
It's just that security and trust is a big concern for me.  I'm not a big fan of downloading programs willy-nilly especially ones that deal with monetary value. Apps that don't have large user bases lack over sight and source code checks and balances even if they are open source. Bitcoin core is probably the most secure right now because there are more eyes on it looking for vulnerabilities and bad code with each update. 
same goes for exchanges and sites that deal with bitcoin. I trust very few of them. Only the ones that have insurance and are licensed. Even then I am still not fully sold.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:44:33
cry and look at the huge number for days.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:23:10
I was kinda hoping some bitcoin core devs would make a lighter version of their bitcoin core. A wallet that looks and feels exactly like bitcoin core but runs like andorid bitcoin wallet without the space requirement.

Some of the new tech settles instantly. For instance byteballs (weird name) but It uses DAG. I could see that or something similar filling the void of payments.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:12:34
You guys should be looking at market cap not price. More coins exist now and they are more distributed instead of solely in the hands of a few strong handed holders. Market will behave and act different.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:28:45
less money was invested in bitcoin at the time. There were only about 3 exchanges determining price and the one with the most volume (mt gox) had questionable practices like the infamous willy bot theory.
@_date: 2016-07-11 06:23:57
how many coins were bought since 300 anticipating this and waiting to take profit? also how much demand is left since 300?

no thanks
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:27:36
I don't know what to think about them, but I was more or less thinking about the dozens of other new exchanges that I have never heard of or seen anyone mention that have around the same amount of volume as the well known exchanges.
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:55:44
You do realize this proves nothing right? If a shady exchange is creating a fractional reserve there is no way of knowing since most exchanges don't share wallet addresses.
Hell a shady exchange could print as many as they like and even have fake trades, fake orders and fake customers and there is no way of proving anything because traders and customers that don't exist never withdraw. Why would a shady exchange do that you ask? To get real people to sell low and buy high. To create a illusion of volume and liquidity so their exchange looks legit. If their fake orders out number their real accounts  they can make price do whatever they want to a degree especially if they know where all the stops are or when a real customer logs in to make a trade. They could move their buy and sell walls around milliseconds before the order completes or even make it look like there is massive selling or buying taking place.
one of the main reasons I only trust regulated well known exchanges which there are only a few that exist today.

I'm not completely sure. I'm waiting it out. I don't want to wake up and lose all my profit from the dramatic 250 rise from last november. Like i did when we sat around in the 600's 2 years ago. If i see volume and buyers I'll happily jump back in a little. with tight stops of course.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:22:47
Well, if you look the bitcoin market cap chart we were already pretty close to all time high in the 700's. It takes more money invested in bitcoin to reach the same prices now that more coins or "shares" exist.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:05:37
I think if it was going to continue going up it would have hit 700 by now. instead mass dumping happens around 660. It looks like whales are exiting and deleveraging to me.
