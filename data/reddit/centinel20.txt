Ok so i used nmap to see if the port is openen and I get: PORT 8333/tcp STATE filtered SERVICE bitcoin
The ssh port: PORT 22/tcp STATE open SERVICE ssh
Does the bitcoin port need to be open or is filtered ok?
Edit: both public ip and internal ip give out the same thing on port 8333. Also I have setenforce 0 to let selinux be permissive. And still filtered.

Maybe I can be of some assistance. Deflation as the collapse of the money supply wich is what it is is bad. What people here are trying to say is falling prices due to eficiency and a money that preserves ita value. While this is not Deflation per say, just as prices rising is not inflation per say, they are trying to refer to the latter which is very good for humanity.

@_date: 2018-05-17 03:59:59
You are absolutely right. I assumed it was working because it was configured. It is not forwarding tge ports for some reason. Or atleast I cant see them open on any tool. But does there need to be something on the config for bitcoin core such as server=true or sonething like that?

Ah so much damage done by this guy. Once lightning is implemented bitcoin will have a pow pos hybrid. And bitcoin doesnt need inflation inflation is not good. There is a theory in economics, wich name escapes me, that determines that the idea amount of money is the moneyavailable. All transactions will take place with the amount of money available, and this is true speccially in bitcoin where the coins can be divided infinitely( not dovides really because the code is defined in satoshis)

Bcash is an exact copy of bitcoin before the upgrade that fixed a bunch of bugs and gave us segwit wich allows for infinite scalability ( atleast in theory ). The other diference is that bcash has 8mb blocks while bitcoin has 2mb blocks. Bcash suporters like the bugs because its more profitable for them to exploit them. They are also pushing for ever larger blocks wich is a bit crazy ( try transmiting validating and storing 1gb every 10min, that is dificult to say the least). Anyway basically bcash is a hostile attack on bitcoin. An atempt to disrupt both politically and technologically what bitcoin is. It will fail so i wouldnt worry too much about it. Hope this clarifies some things.

And there is nothing centraliced about billions of users having a multitude of open channels earning fees.
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:47:44
Yes exactly. Now that most of the spam has subsided, Im guessing because the 2x and bch guys think they got what they wanted, you can see a more realistic amount of real transactions. Which unfortunetly means that not a lot of ppl are using bitcoin. But thats fine, ita on an upward trend. So for now until lightnin segwits 2mb limit will do.

@_date: 2017-09-27 15:56:20
The thing is. 2x is not an increase to 2mb, segwit already did that. 2x is an increase to ~8mb this becomes really big really fast. And you can only do like 70 transactions per second. So no good to compete against visas 10,000 tps. Also the 2x client btc-1 has absolutely no testing and no development so that is dangerous to implement on a 70 billion dollar network.

I dont know if they are against open source but at the moment there is no development of btc-1 with the exception of the copy paste they are doing of core. When confronted with this people who support 2x say that it is being developed in the slack channel which no one can join. This is: they are (suposedly) developig in secret. That is not open source.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:58:24
Not true. Even at 8mb you can only do like 70tps its no where near what you need for a global adoption. Layer 2 options like lightning give you billions and potentially limitless cheap transactions, now we are talking.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:44:37
Ok so the miners have been blocking segwit ( segregated witness ) an upgrade that includes bug fixes and most importantly a way to implement certain 2nd layer solutions such as lightning network wich permit for therically unlimited transactions per second. They mostly block it because they want to use a bug on bitcoin called asicboost secretly, wich reduces theyr electricity cost by around 20%. Also they would like bitcoin to be controlled by theyr cartel. Users grew tired of this and threatened to leave the miners behind and activate segwit with a UASF (user activated soft fork) this caused the miners and some large bitcoin companies ( coinbase, shapeshift, and a lot of digital currwncy group companies (DCG) ) to meet behind closed doors and in secret to make an agreement( the new york agreement) to beat the users and activate segwit, then take control of the development of bitcoin by promoting a hard fork and develop theyr own vetion of bitcoin wich has double the size of segwit (~8mb), This is 2x(there has been absolutely no development of the client called btc-1, the 1 developer they have has copied and pasted all of the upgrades core have made. If there is development hapening it is in secret). They have efectively created a new cartel with the miners. Before they could activate segwit a large group of miners and participants of the nya( new york agreement) decided to break away and make theyr own hard fork called bcash (bch). I hope this helps.

@_date: 2017-09-27 22:37:44
You are right I didnt directly counter your argument. Here it goes: ultimately it is untrue that increasing the blocksize will enable more transactions per second because at 8mb the blockchain becomes so large so fast and the latancy so long that the network becomes unsecure and unstable unscalable. Thus not being able to service more users. :)

As far as how does china play out in all of this. Who knows. Miners switched back and forth when bch ( bitcoin cash ) forked. Nothing happened. Miners will look for profitability, as they should, and mining can move to Russia or japan ( both of which have offered cheap electricity and are developing asic chip production) in case china bans ( i would say its a good thing since it would decentrilize mining a little).

Yes its enough. Mempool is empty.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:28:02
Not to mention everyone keeps saying its a 2mb block increase. But segwit is already ~2mb 2x is an 8mb block! 
Edit: aparently I was unclear. Segwit allows for close to 2mb blocks. 2x allows for close to 8mb blocks. So it kinda triples the size already doubled by segwit. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:56:42
What you say is correct. Except the 2 parties are a few large companies and a large number of miners. Developers where not included. Users werbt either. The thing is we dont know what the terms of the agreement where since its a secret agreement. But since bcash is out and the 2x btc-1camp isnt developing, hasnt tested theyr software, refuses to implement replay protection. It becomes pretty dangerous to implement it. So im guessing there where a couple of important points that havnt been met: 1. Bitcoin was to remain in 1 chain ( this is gone since the miners broke this part with bcash) 2. Reasonable safety and testig of the new implementation as to ensure the safety of the network ( 70billions woth of network by the way and there is no testing or assurance since the code doesnt exist or is secret). This is all speculation. But i would guess reasonable to assume.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:53:30
Its sort of an attack on the network. It hasnt been tested. There is no widespread consensus. And it stemed out of a secret agreement between companies that we dont know exactly what it says.

What baffles me is that blockchain was invented in 1991. If its so inovative why did no one use it back then? The thing all the blockchain yes bitcoin no people dont understand is blockchain is only one of several technologies and technical advances ( Computer science, economics, networks, psycology, political science, Game theory, cryptography, and I really dont know how many more disciplines ) that form bitcoin. A blockchain is just a really expensive database.

Sorry. Some redditors are a bit agressive. I guess its just frustrating for a lot of people that this is happening. However its just delaying the inevitable. Generaly the market follows the talent. It happened in etherium hard fork for example, even if etc ( ether classic ) is more ideologically sound, the altcoin eth took all the talent with it. So the same will happen with bitcoin. Who would want to run software that hasnt been tested and keep money on it? Anyway back to the point, you are right they are free to do as they like, it is free software, but its still a dick move and they are still bad actors making an attack on the network. But bitcoin will prove to be anti fragile once again. Cheers.

@_date: 2017-10-28 17:21:12
I think we should wait and see if segwit and lightning fix some of this risks. We know that segwit makes asicboost useless, this will make it easier to compete against bitmain. And lightning will make bitcoin into a proof of work/proof of stake hybrid involving more parties and thus increasing decentralisation. Lets wait a little and see where these pieces fall. If it becomes necesary to do a hard fork it should be done right and not emergency rush. And a lot more things can be fixed with it so we should have those upgrades ready. That is why i oppose 2x. I wouldn't be afraid of 90 percent of the hashrate going to mine 2x that will not happen. We are almost down to 80% signaling NYA  . And the futures of 2x coin are at 800 bucks  . At the current difficulty it costs around 1200USD to produce a bitcoin so the  cost to produce a 2x coin will be the same, so all miners that move to the 2x side completely will be operating at a 30% loss. That will be unsustainable belive me I run a factory no business can hold a 30% loss for more than a month. 2x doesnt have the stupid emergency dificulty adjustment BitCH had. It will be messy but this will blow over in a month. Dont worry too much about it just keep your coins safe. Cheers!

No. Its a block size increase. Check a recent mined block list. Some blocks are already more than 1 mb.

They would probably go: Yea! You go Roger! That will teach those scammers not to mess with bitcoin jesus. Dox the heck out of that scammer. Well done. 
Might have gone overboard.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:29:38
But why rush it in 3 months? Segwit was tested for over 3 years! If the 2x guys really cared they would have followed good software practices and work on a more reasonable timeline aswell as contribute resources to the development. Which they havent.

I wrote this a while back it has some basic stuff:
I think your concerns are very valid. First: understanding bitcoin as an open source proyect. That means the bitcoin team is you and me and all bitcoiners. If there are problems we can solve we should colaborate to do so. Second: understanding bitcoin as a protocol. Think about the internet, are there 2 internets? There are smaller intranets and networks but there is a base layer that we call the internet. The internet is massively expensive to run but because of eficiency and innovation the end user gets a relatively cheap service.
Now given that: bitcoin can be thought of as the internet a base layer where other aplications and services can be run on top of. I can give you a couple of probable solutions to some of the problems you bring up. By no means this is what will happen, the truth is we dont know, would we ever have predicted facebook amazon and google?
As bitcoin becomes more scarce it becomes more valuable. How many gold bullions you think are lost each year? I would bet not many. So there will come a moment when people stop loosing bitcoin. This works well with a concept of sidechains. When bitcoin is worth 1,000,000USD 1 satoshi ( .00000001 btc) will be woth one USD cent that means transactions smaller than that wont be possible. But you can have a pegged sidechain that can subdivide the satoshi into smaller fractions. 
As for the mining fees. A space in the bitcoin ledger will have a market price wich will balace itself out with the amount of security it provides and the need for that security. The fees will adjust but on ledger transactions will be( in a 100 years ) really expensive. But that doesnt matter because we will use 2nd and 3rd layer solutions that will be dirt cheap. 
The thing is at 2 mb wich is what bitcoin blocks can have at the moment we can do maximum 14 transactions per second (tps), what is tragic about this is that even at 8 mb you can only do 56 tps. Visa, for comparison, does 10000 tps. We would need a blocksize of 1428mb to match it, and we dont want to match it we want to surpass it! Imagine more than a gb each 10 minites. That breaks moors law curve pretty good, no one could keep up with that amount of storage. So here come the layer 2 solutions. One proposal is to use, now that segwit is active it allows for this,  a solution called lightning network wich is an offchain payment channels protocol. You can theorically do infinite numbers of transactions and then only touch the blockchain to settle after some time. Now thats more like it! Billions of transactions per second means theyll be dirt cheap but once it setles all those cheap transactions will amount to quiet a bit of bitcoin wich will be used to pay for the space on the blockchain and all the people who provide liquidity to the network.
I forgot if there were more concearns and i know i made a huge post. But I hope this gives you some ideas of what is possible. And what we havnt imagined yet. Cheers.
Edit: forgot about the forks. Dont worry too much about it. Bitcoin is what you call anty fragile like most open source proyects like linux. What makes it anty fragile is the comunity around it. Its like a sayin ( you know. Dragon ball ) the more you attack it the stronger it gets.

You forgot to tilt it slightly like bcash! Or maybe to be more original. Make it upside down?

@_date: 2017-09-28 08:39:58
There is no time. The agreement is not public we dont know what is being planned! There is nothing to work with here except trust btc-1 client that is being developed in secret and hope for the best. Sorry but that is not acceptable for a 60billion dollar network. Not even microsoft would do something like this to its sistems.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:12:28
Not to mention the code isnt beibg developed ( or developed in secret ) and we dont really know what these people signed since that is secret aswell. I think the biggest problem is not su much the block increase but the secrecy adn subterfuge.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:36:20
Thank you all so much for making bitcoin what it is!
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:33:59
Yea I understand. Its 3am so i cant articulate a long answer. The thing is the speed of light is set and electronic signals can only go so fast. So once you go through a certain size, someone once argued it was 300kb the latency starts to become an issue its not immediatly apparent but it makes the network more vulnerable as it takes longer for the whole network to get and validate blocks. This opens up the theoretical posibilities of all kinds of attacks. Im not sure if i articulated this correctly.

Some people would regard what ether did as going against the ethos of an unmutable decentraliced ledger. The dao had a bug but dao wasnt the same as ether. ether wasnt insecure yet they decided to split the chain, still when they did it they had broad consensus and it still caused a split. Bitcoin doesnt have catastrofic bugs on the code and most known lesser bugs are fixed on the segwit upgrade, which was tested and perfected for over 2 years. The problem is that when you are willing to risk a 60 billion dollar network on a software which isnt being developed, much less tested, and kept in secret and rolled out in 3 months. That is a problem. A hard fork needs a lot more testing and development to be done correctly and securely and a lot other things could be included to make the most of the upgrade. The buttom line is that its not about the blocksize. Its about power and controll. And that is not ok for an open sofware proyect, which bitcoin is.

This isnt very well thought out. Enen if a building is condemned the land is still worth something. And when were talking about buildings, they can last forever. The only reason a building would be destroyed would be to build something better for that place at that moment.

explanation: 2 different visions, some miners and companies want more centraliced control ( I would assume with them controlling ) users and most of the comunity including the programmers who have made most of the code would like to atleast keep everything as decentraloced as it is now. All of this using the excuse of a real life problem wich is the saturation of the bitcoin network. The solution to this and many other "problems" bitcoin has was made as a new version called segwit wich builds on the existing vertion. After 2 years of testing and making shure everything is going to work and screening the comunity to make sure there is consensus the developers launch segwit with a threshold of 95 percent hashpower expecting everything to go well, after all sewit is tested and benefits all. But some miners make a power play to see what they can achieve, a hail marry if you will, they will atleast get huge transaction fees for aslong as they can delay segwit ( aparently they are also secretly using an exploit wich reduces the cost of mining by 20% called asiboost which is not compatible with segwit ), so they make a competing proposal called unlimited which doesnt build on the existing code but creates a new chain and blocks segwit since it was launched for 95 percent wich is pratically full consensus. Now users and programmers are tired of not getting segwit activated and paying huge ( for bitcoin standards ) fees. And so it was proposed.to activate segwit with user support, this triggered an accord between important companies and miners ( leaving users and programmers behind) to make an activation of sewit before the users activate it, but with the condition of making theyr new chain in 3 months. And they want to program this and run it across all data centers in 3 weeks ( which if you know IT this is madness not sparta ). And that is where we are now. Best case scenario sewit gets activated and the new chain gets forgotten and never happens, worse case scenario segwit activates and the miners try to make theyr chain and bitcoin continues on without them, then they come back crying looking for the profits they lost by going on a worthless chain. I hpe this helps.
TLDR; 2 proposals:  segwit: less centralization and fixing problems. Unlimited: more centralization promise to fix problems later. segwit2x: half ass atempt to save face by the miners, we get segwit (yey!) But the risk of a chain split in 3 months.

Litecoin can be the cents to bitcoina dollars. The silver to bitcoins gold. In all seriousness litecoin could be an impotant sidechain to bitcoin. When bitcoin is 1 million usd 1 satoshi will be 1 cent. This means after that small or micro transactions will be dificult or imposible. A good secure sidechain that can instantly exchange between btc and the sidechain ( litecoin ia an excelet candidate because it has atomic swaps with btc ) and thus be able to further divide the unit without having to make a hard fork and change the unit.
