A major political or economic event (with bloodshed in the streets) in the US can make bitcoin explode overnight, and can make the quote literally true.  Also, keep in mind that Bitcoin has seen worse periods than this (like when it crashed 95%).  And yet, a few years later, you had Bitcoin millionaires, and everyone believed that *they* were going to strike it rich using Bitcoin.  And then, the bears returned.  
If Bitcoin was going to disappear, it likely would've already gone away since Bitcoin has seen far worse.  It's here to stay.   At some point within the next few years, everyone will forget that Bitcoin has seen hard times, and we will go through Bitcoin and cryptomania again, likely much larger than before...and then it will crash.  That's how markets work.  And that's the entire justification for buying gold (or silver).  Paint a picture of armageddon (Global Warming, horrifying war. terrorism, doomsday economic crash, asteroid strike, etc.), and then tell people that the key to security is the buy gold.  Buy when there is blood in the streets.  Worked for a lot of people, including with Bitcoin.

That is a possibility.  Remember that Dimon was publicly blasting bitcoin while his JPMC company bought more than $100 million worth of BTC.

At the very least, you should diversify your portfolio.  I've profited many occasions from Bitcoin, although I recently lost money (having pulled out nearly completely when the price fell down to $6500).  That is the nature of markets though.  
So why then?  Simply because there is *potential* for profit.  And whenever there is potential, (no matter how dangerous, difficult, or unlikely winning actually is) there will be an endless number of people working to strike it rich.  Besides, people play lotto and go to casinos even though the chance of winning big is very small, and even though you are mathematically guaranteed to lose if you play long enough.

He is probably just looking for a cheap buy-in.  Don't think you will escape the whales by investing in crypto.  They will be (and likely already are) the biggest investors.
