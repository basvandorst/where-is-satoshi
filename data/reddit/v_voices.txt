You're suppose to, depending on your country. I report all my stocks traded. This year I've added crypto to my investment portfolio.

Sounds like it was just the market movement. BTC VS BCH, not mush to say. Don't own BTC and only have a small position in BCH which I'll be selling soon.

Interesting. Just getting around to see what all this BCH news is and reason for this latest pop....

Yes definitely trade under market value, especially today with all the selling. I'm usually watch multi exchanges for price diff. I mark all my trades on my phone (blockfolio app). Binance fees are .1 (I believe) but if you own a few BNB you'll get a 50% temporary discount [every year the discount will decreases: 50% year 1, 25% year 2, etc.]. You didn't mess up, you just paid .1 in fees instead of .05 (while in bittrex you were paying .25 in fees). The small amounts of ETH/BTC is dust, doesn't meet the minimum quantity to trade, but it's just pennies.

Day and night, binance has been wayyyyy better then bittrex/poloniex for me. Still have 2 support tickets with bittrex, months old, all I got was an auto reply + they held my coins hostage till I was forced to prove my ID even though I HAD a legacy account. 
Binance does have it's hiccups like no stop limits or no sweep dust [hope they add soon]. Other then that, I've been pretty impressed with binance, buy few BNB coins for discount on fees and happy trading.
