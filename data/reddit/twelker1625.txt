If you live in CA or NY or maybe even in Fl you’ll understand that this isn’t really that far fetched of an idea. A lot of foreign investors from China, Russia and other countries buy real estate in these markets as a safe alternative to savings In their home country. Maintaining a house that appreciates faster than the expenses and the safety of the investment has dramatically raised prices in these markets and, I’m sure, several others around the world. Make Bitcoin easy, understandable and safe to store for the masses, not just the tech literate, and you’ll see an explosion in the price of BTC.

It’s a mess for sure, but seized means confiscated not frozen. It means you’re no longer in control of the assets. If someone else controls the assets then you do not have access to those funds and cannot distribute them if needed. 
I don’t know the details but seized is a word they use, not me and while litigation may in fact go in their favor, it doesn’t guarantee the assets will be returned.

Same same but different

Seized and safeguarded do not complement each other. So which is it, seized OR safeguarded? 
Jesus! The response is worse than the news. Was it written by a fifth grader? Take some of your millions and hire a press corespondent, or at least someone with a smidgeon of writing skills.

Liquidation usually means forced, as in, meet the capital call or be liquidated. Covering a short position doesn’t necessarily mean they lost money, they are just closing the short position. Since it says liquidated i’d guess they were forced to sell. Just my opinion though.
