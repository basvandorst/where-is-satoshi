Our Satoshi who art in heaven, Bitcoin be thy name. Your miners come, Your chains be done, In alts as it is in BTC. Give us this day our daily spread. And forgive us our FUD, as we forgive those, who panic sell against us. And lead us not into fomo, but deliver us from fiat. For crypto is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

Turns out when you send them emails, they just reply with a bot. And then you message that bot again, it just keeps going like that....

This post isn't about my personal experience, I can't say what I own and how much for obvious reasons. But that's just one of the problems my friends have been encountering with transferring BTC on Coinbase and such.

Think about its many qualities, censorship resistant for example, is the tradeoff between resistance and decreased convenience really efficient? Why would someone bother to pay transaction fee for everyday legal transactions (haircut, grocery and gas) just so one could avoid the papertrails from NSA and IRS? And in places that could use its censorship resistant features like North Korea for example, the usercase is dramatically reduced.

They already make money from users, when you store money in Venmo before you transfer it to your bank, they make money from interest off of the loans using your "deposit".

From my understanding you are free to purchase and sell cryptos online, the only reason ICOs are banned are due to potential money laundering concerns (they are cracking down on that in China). But majority of the medias are missing a key piece, there's almost no incentives to use BTC for transaction in China as Wechat Pay is dominating the financial service industry. And giving that majority of the population have no exposure to Bitcoin beside its crazy runups value wise. So in a country where it's already going cashless unlike the US, BTC has limited potentials in the short term.
