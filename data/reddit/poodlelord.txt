It helps to associate bitcoin with shady underworld stuff.

If you dont ever do what you want though..

Not all press is good press.
This is not good press, it isn't too far from an endorsement from a drug lord.

Any government can do a lot to hurt the value of the coin by making it harder to trade or trying to ban it.
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:57:31
That isn't exactly the kind of endorsement you want lol.

essentially using blockchain technology to get all the music metadata in one place where it can be easily updated.  currently there are a bunch of unconnected databases for this stuff. then pay everyone through bitcoin so people get payed in days rather than months.

It didnt start as a result of for profit prisons. For proffit prisons arrose as a result of the war on drugs.
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:56:51
how exactly is this even possible?
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:16:08
Good moderation. I agree with this judgment. BItCoIn isn't as ready to spend as even the car in some places.

10 key pads are for anyone who likes efficiency.

What actions did the company take to increase their value? Are they continuing to do those things, do they still increase value? Those are the real questions, you won't find your answer just looking at graphs.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:28:52
That's it this sub is officially dead.
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:40:36
No, this sub is not what it was 3 years ago... It has become shitty memes.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:54:19
Yup, 32 gb of ecm was 440 bucks for my recent upgrade. Was very painful.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:10:21
Be honest though it's 90% circle jerk
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:37:26
wouldn't you rather drikn?

Everytime I use an app like that money is in my account with in minute.
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:34:15
This sub is regarded as the worst moderated on the whole of reddit.
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:47:05
Every day we stray further from gods light...

It just means bitcoin is going to have serious issues being a real currency people buy goods on, it's not attractive for small transactions if it takes a week to get your money. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:07:49
And yet still can only process 4 transactions a second :(
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:02:23
Bitcoin can only process 4 transactions a second, so i would not say its strictly better.
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:21:55
No but it will of everyone  started to use it.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:03:53
Someone made a stupid comment! Nice.
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:28:57
Did you even read the rest of the bullshit on this repost.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:45:13
People said the exact same thing 10 years ago, you don't know shit about what will actually go down.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:01:44
I'll take faster transaction times of a credit card tbh.
