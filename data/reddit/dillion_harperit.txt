That's reasonable
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:06:05
Even though Apple excludes us from imessage
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:24:53
This is good idea

Someone I know tells me hardware wallets are not needed and coinbase is fine since it's insured. I however have the same question as you     
    
     
   
Edit: why downvote? I said I have the same question as him I'm just relaying information I've heard 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:00:47
Coinbase is a user friendly gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:20:37
This is what makes me want to invest in a hardwallet
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:15:16
Maybe he meant to say that? ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:08:33
How? It's saying the man loves his job more than op does
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:28:32
Thank you for the information 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:52:17
Same thing going on here 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:11:52
Gdax doesn't have fees??
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:14:32
TIL and switching to GDAX

What's HODL?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:00:12
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:56:56
At 5500?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:58:20
I think you failed at understanding the joke here. Have a nice day

I'm never sure anymore 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:30:15
We don't want to buy bitcoin.. We want to *mine* it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:02:44
What do you think about just buying 2 S9's? Is there anything else I would need?
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:13:40
That still sounds quite profitable to me, thanks a lot for the help mate! :)

Wait.. what? Lucky?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:32:21
Thanks for the information! Would it just be better to mine for Eth or Ltc?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:28:06
I was thinking about a 6 GPU linux machine.. but if it's not profitable for bitcoin, what're your suggestions?
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:19:58
I really appreciate your suggestion, but we already have gaming rigs and would just like to dabble in mining.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:05:20
Thank you so much! We're ordering 1 antminer s9 right now and the powersupply, going to see how that goes for a month and then most likely order a good bit more. After calculations we should only be paying ~$82 on power. We're paying 11c/kWh , does that add up to you or is my math wrong?
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:46:53
What about Eth?
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:50:08
Looking online I see tons of power supplies, are you using an S9 by chance and have a reccomendation for which PSU to purchase?

Do I need the breakout board or is that for running multiple S9s
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:19:24
This is a long term investment if the first month goes well we'll be looking to upgrade the mining op quite a lot, would more machines outweigh the increase in difficulty?
