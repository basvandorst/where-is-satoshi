This would be more appropriate in I will echo that the price is too high. It's almost an insult that you want bitcoin but say "the price could be 100 tomorrow"... So take USD where the price will be USD tomorrow?

Ripple scam blah blah blah. Get over it. There is no need to hold XRP. Instead using it in a quick manner as a bartering tool is fantastic.  
The real concern is how long will ripple hold up to the same pressure of not having proper licensing.

Bitcoin is a engine. While I would love to wait and see every platform built on the engine open source it's not going to happen. Remember when everybody bashed coinbase  and now they are strongly becoming the go to exchange? 
For all we know portals may have the ability to use their own currency already, but choose XRP because people are already familiar with them. My point is already valid because I have used it for over $5,000 worth of transactions in and out of XRP. There have been exchanges for over 3 months buddy. Don't be naive :/

Long read but hopefully will educate anybody AND zombie about this "bitcoin business idea". Taking potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars through illegal funding to open bitcoin ATM in published locations/western countries sounds... Stupid. 
Love the ambition but I need to ask. How long have you been in the bitcoin space? I feel like you may be in over your head if you are buying these machines before even contacting counsel in these regions. Even just sitting on reddit and bitcointalk for the last 8 months (I've been for 18) would have most coming to the realization that until a money transmitter license is obtained in the us you are wasting money. 
Please EVERYBODY keep in mind. Regulation in the US is the next hurdle and there are more eyes on bitcoin than ever. Bitcoin ATMs are more brash than say the pirate ponzi scheme and look how the SEC came down on him. I'm afraid with the many posts about how unprofitable mining is , we will see many group buys/funding which are just out of their league. 
If you REALLY want this to work in the long run I suggest you partner with a company who has a money transmitter license at minimum. Go talk to the guys at Neo&amp;BEE and see how it's going in a country who is as open as Cyprus AND has the capital. You may find a cautionary tale of a beast unravelling  that could save you a lot of time. 
Last but not least. I glanced at your forum posts and saw a popular name on bitcointalk for an escrow service. Please people don't send your btc to anyone who's idea sounds great but goes from a unicorn(1US based ATM) to a rhino (10+international ATMs) in hours. Once there is concrete proof of a business license and counsel has been obtained THEN take a look at it.   
Tldr: If you don't know who pirateat40 is you shouldn't be investing in the bitcoin space at all.

I was hoping to start a geocache for bitcoin. Use the geography of the city and place qr codes as needed. Have the balances changing randomly so you never know if you will be a winner or not when you go. Obviously larger wallets will be in tough to get to spots, or require multiple locations before you have the full (qr code?)
Once this gets rolling hire a few people in bitcoin popular cities to walk around with qr code hats. People start asking what bitcoin is,  which would be a win win for us. Eventually use donation/site traffic revenue to create a blitz campaign where we have stashed a large amount of btc somewhere. Every news company will love it. Every you get person will think of all the shit they can buy on SR.  Tons of traffic, tons of users, we win the world.

They hardly put them to shame. Having a gift card which is available for weeks (years?) to come, for purchases when you have no internet or access to your btc is very valuable. While 2% is reasonable gyft gives you 3% back, so if you consider 5% peanuts then we should be friends. I'll purchase anything you want day to day and you can give me 5% :) 
I have not used snapcard in all honesty and it appears they are more put together than bitpay, but we all remember that experience. I think it is currently more valuable for adoption from existing business, which already have a dialogue with other companies, than for new bitcoin only business to start right now
Side by side Atlas Shrugged comparison. What experience denotes value added? I'm going with gyft over snapcard. Is gyft perfect? No. Will two airlines, two grocery stores, and two fuel companies make it? My opinion is yes!

Makes me wonder if they are leaving it be because they're falling behind so they don't get too many more orders. Or because they are not really giving the project much energy and haven't even noticed. 
Conspiracy would be because they know there is a huge correction coming and where the dust will settle is how much they want to be selling them for.

We need companies who recognize the volatility but understand the magnitude of the engine.  Payments? Sure! I see the most use coming from some aspect of the protocol we have yet to see in action. Colored coins, ripple, and third world exchanges that account for volatility and we are rolling.

I absolutely love being able to quickly convert some btc into USD without having to use an exchange. Coming from a person who holds 90% of their funds in btc this gives me peace of mind sometimes going to sleep. Since early July this peace of mind is almost constant with low volatility.  For all those people who may bash me for not keeping it to what I can afford to lose, I will say this. The only time I have lost money is the week we went from 200+ down, and I had plenty of opportunities to not lose anything at all had I not been on airplanes with no Internet connection. 
 Bridgewalker allows one to do this, but I think they are android only. Their fee is 1% which is equal to an exchange. I think this service would flourish if one could get it to a  .5% fee.

After seeing many people casually inhale the solvents propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin I have come to one conclusion. They are good to use to quit, but should not be considered substantially healthier during the process or if continued.

It says it on the Dow website as well as the msds. I think you feel I'm saying it's as bad as smoking, but I'm not. I'm saying it shouldn't be thought of as a safe alternative but I totally suggest it be used to quit and do believe it's not as bad as smoking.

If you are really serious about completing it you totally can. I suggest finding a flight instructor you like at a club where instructors are independent contractors. Then just explain bitcoin to them and how you would like to get your license, but bitcoin is the only way. Explain bitpay etcetera.
 I may have one in the SF Bay Area.

It's amazing what 6 months will do for an exchange. Coinbase was getting bashed HARD at the beginning of the year, now look at them!

I totally understand the bashing of the paper. 10 years isn't ideal, but let me point out a few things. The best model comes with the ability to back up your keys onto a USB. It also has USB drives for a monitor, keyboard, and mouse which means if you can set it up to print on a regular printer. If in ten years you haven't scanned a watch only copy, saved multiple copies of encrypted usbs and the Internet/bitcoin still exist I think there may be a larger problem. 
The main purpose for  it, or any paper printer for that matter, is low cost secure generation of keys.  With a little bit of effort you can achieve anything you want in this generation of paper printers.

The logic behind this argument is sad. There are many ways for a government to pay "people" without knowing. Do you really think a government is going to pay a contractor, not a spy, via a payment method that is in its infancy? Do you realize that it's nowhere near anonymous?
You can't equate bitcoins crazy ride the other month to Cyprus. 
You can't bail out a failing economy to bitcoin, as in Argentina. 
While I love bitcoin there are and will always be way more practical ways to perform covert operations. You think it sucks trying to verify a mtgox account or finding somewhere close by to trade more than $1000 worth of coins? You remember there are still no trusted prepaid credit cards that are international right? Anonymity is not solved with bitcoin. Boarder less cash proxy is the real gem here, and even that is on chopping block with the recent FinCen talking points.

I don't understand why nobody has explained the proper way to do it..
Your LB account has a deposit address under the wallet tab. Fund your account, or look at the advertisement he started with you and fund that address. Then once you meet and be shows/gives you the money you can release it an will receive a code which is used to prove its been release ( he will already have this code, this is for him to know you have release). That way he instantly receives them in his wallet.
After you can both leave feedback etc etc. I highly suggest using LB wallet and basic escrow, which is the code thing I mentioned above, if you are struggling with how to meet someone and sell them coins. It's a very basic function than is straightforward from a third party which goes a long way making first timers comfortable.

Haha I love how people down vote in this sub. 
A warning that its a .onion link, that's all. While many people on and probably running tor I doubt many people are.  
And It's not fear, it's transparency. I don't think having to use Tor to by bitcoins is necessary. Maybe I just live in a place where localbitcoins is popular.

 I've applied a few times over the last six months. It's interesting because I know they have seen my msgs and linked in profile, but have not even said "No thank you". I have a feeling this new round of funding will allow the great minds at Coinbase to build and hire as needed to beef up the already amazing service. 
The funniest thing is I've wanted to work there since the spring because I know they are one of the most important business that exist in this space. The  ranking yesterday only made me bummed I wasn't part of the team yet.
