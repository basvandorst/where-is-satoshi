This guy is so full of shit.  I am glad I saw all of those Bitconnect ads after his and went all in.

That is why you get dark colored shelving.

Mind sharing your exhaust layout and which fans you use?  I am building a datacenter in the garage for GPU mining this month.  I'm sure you know all about how big of a problem heat is.

Wow.

Most people who are invested in something don't like FUD.

So don't send BTC using an app you don't trust?  Come on now.

It doesn't, but OK!  Unless you are strictly speaking of a bull market during which you sell to take profit.

Why?  Apps may glitch, but the blockchain never lies.  If you understand how the tech works, this image should be no cause for concern.

This is false.  You are still extremely limited when compared to the Android counterpart.  iPhone is great for the average user, but for power users Android is king.

ZEC (ZCash) performed their first atomic swap with BTC a month ago by the way.

Your Bitcoin debit card holds a BTC or fiat balance?  I assume it holds a fiat balance that you initially filled by converting BTC.  BTC is unrealistic for microtransactions at the moment and anyone who understands the tech knows it.

Apparently not.  Thank you for clearing it up without being rude.

What is this then?
