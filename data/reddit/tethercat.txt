I have no idea. I mean, I didn't think my junk warranted that much praise. It's good junk 'n all, and I like it, and I'm sure others like it, but not enough to click on some sketchy link by some "redditor for 20 hours".

Yeahhhhh, I was figuring it was something like that.  Ahhh wellllll....
Maybe *someday* someone will love me for my crotch, and not just my immense vault of coins.

I'm really glad you could make use of it. Great job. Keep it up.
You should [tineye]( some of those pics and see if anything shows.

So I guess that happened, huh?
@_date: 2015-03-04 15:23:23
I figured it was this guy.

So it reaches front page?? Ha ha! Ahhh you're good. Actually put a smile on my face there. 
I'm pretty sure that not everyone puts things on reddit solely for glory of front page, not that you'd understand that. 
Also... why are your parents siblings? That's weird. You're weird. Stop being weird.

I was thinking it was Gaz from Invader Zim, with her Game Slave.

I'm thinking back to *all* the nudes I have online... like, there's gotta be terabytes of them... I mean, I barely wear clothes ever... and I'm amazed at how much of a touch-typer that poster is.
Any sane person would've gone blind.

Obviously, I didn't click on it. Did you? What was in it?
