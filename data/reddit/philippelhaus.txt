Yeah exactly, 1MB is already a hard fucking limit. With segwit its already over the border.
The Blocksize needs to stay small and space on a block needs to be expensive. I wouldnt reduce it further from 1MB, thats a perfect size.
People need to be forced by high fees to use Lightning. Lightning is a kick ass solution, similiar to what Alternating Current was to the problem of Direct Current limitations back in the 1900‘s. It will allow Bitcoin to scale fast and being extremly cheap at the same time. It‘s that good of a solution, im not even making this up or hyping it.

1mb is fine, LN will fix a lot.

Anyone known of a date when Lightning Network will activate for the MainNet ?

1MB Blocks are fine; they will force users to use LN because of the high fees. LN transfer will be way cheaper and way faster, we all know it. The question is, when will LN deploy? I tested yesterday Eclair Version of LN , the Alpha, but didnt get it to run on Win sadly due to some RPC problem. I found a vid of some guy managing to get it to work on Linux and it looked cool af. Can‘t hardly wait till this gets deployed, seriously Lightning is, even in a conservative sense, a massive Game Changer.
Anyone know of any dates when LN will transfer from TestNet to MainNet ?

this is not true. 
all cryptos together today = 37 bil / day
nyse = ~169 bil / day 
(2013 figure! Its propably way bigger now)

I checked, the Integration test from the three teams passed, the standard is done (
i doubt that it will still take „long“ or „very long“ till it gets deployed, on the eclair git they have been very busy the last days reporting all sorts of bugs (good sign) - i don‘t think it will be years till this goes live.
