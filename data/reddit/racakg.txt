I haven't gotten my hands on a Pi 3 yet. Overclocking is safe because you can just undo the settings if things start getting a bit hot or unstable, so you should try it and report back :)

Laughed so hard I spilt my drink. Thanks a lot.

I trust him with a $16.1B industry.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:04:58
Not very well.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:21:00
What a waste of $5,000.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:42:43
Transactions are independent of blocks. A transaction that uses an unconfirmed input is no different to a transaction using a confirmed input.
By default I think that Bitcoin-Qt will only use an unconfirmed input if it's an input created by itself (change) as it wouldn't be safe to trust somebody else. Not sure about other clients though, they could do something different.

Maybe the stick could sign a timestamp for somebody to verify that it has the private key?
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:42:14
Where'd you buy the Bitcoin from?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:23:56
Yeah it seems that not all of the nodes added recently are genuine. However a lot of them are probably real, I recently set up a full node and have convinced a few friends to set one up too.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:18:12
I believe the SegWit proposal increases the limit to 4 megabytes?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:29:11
Is the cutout at the top for a fan? You can get decent overclocks on a Pi with just passive cooling
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:12:03
I just set up a full node at home too, going to set up some more on other servers too.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:01:12


You mean a shitty DAO smart contract that got hacked?
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:54:12
Segwit has been running on the testnet for quite a while now.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:42:55
The one with Jihad Wu at the wheel does.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:28:52
Praise should be given where it's due :)

Segwit has been running on testnet for quite some time.

This is a pretty good drawing, looks like it belongs in a newspaper.

Nothing is ASIC resistant.

What were people really expecting when they signed up for cloud mining though?
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:45:03
I agree that recently maybe it is a bit too much, it'll hopefully calm down soon.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:15:22
Build it from source, it only takes a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:27:12
It looks like a food processor.

Why is it clickbait? The link is exactly what the title promised it'd be.

Mystery of the century right there.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:02:02
Do we need an obituary for obituaries?
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:43:21
The CIA text on Gavin's shirt makes this perfect.

I'm never going to exchange my coins back to dollars, but I still use Bitcoin as a currency. Currently using it to buy games on Steam, things on Amazon, for a VPN service and for a VPS :)
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:46:35
How'd you block all of the DO IP addresses? Did you do it with iptables or something in bitcoin.conf?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:41:43


Well, what else do you expect them to do?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:09:35
I don't think many people are "pro small blocks forever". Eventually block sizes will need to increase, but BU is plain irresponsible.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:55:53
I don't think he walks around enough.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:33:14
Ah yeah, better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:12:33
Yeah, we need to let the miners choose the block reward! Fsck the central planners!^^^^/s
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:41:11
In Bitcoin you can spend an unconfirmed input (what I'm presuming you mean by an IOU).
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:06:58
The threat of legal action is absurd, but let's not forget that BitFury are signalling for SegWit support.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:10:56
Thanks I'm going to try that now.
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:46:59
It just constantly uses 6 minutes and 20 seconds of downtime. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:25:16
So as long as my node has caught up with the network, I can have as many addresses/accounts as I want without things slowing down too much?


I think that the getbalance call has a parameter for the minimum number of confirms.
And thanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:10:21
There's a page on coin.dance for this.

Why not use the rest of the SI prefixes? Seems like millibitcoins and microbitcoins are already common.
No harm in also using kilobitcoins or nanobitcoins too.
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:24:40
Why are they going to see a huge jump? I suppose they'd get to use Lightning, but Litecoin blocks are nearly empty and happen even more frequently than Bitcoin blocks so transaction capacity is not a worry for them.
@_date: 2017-04-09 15:38:47
bitcoin-cli should be installed along with bitcoind when you `make install`.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:56:58
He has some strong opinions, but he's still an excellent programmer.
As for why he works on Bitcoin, only he can answer that. He's active on so maybe he'll reply c:
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:54:35
Same here
    $ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo | grep subversion
      "subversion": "/Satoshi:0.14.0(UASF-SegWit-BIP148)/"
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:21:12
I'll have a look at doing that, thanks 
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:20:55
Alright I'll stress test it beforehand just to make sure.
