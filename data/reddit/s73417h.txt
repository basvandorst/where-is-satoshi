Many rich people invest in casinos but themselves do not gamble in those casinos....

I suppose that depends on how much reward and how long the expected future is ��

I appreciate the sentiment of your argument. However, respectfully, that’s just just really poor logic and bad advice.
Why would you ignore all tangible metrics by which to assess the value of something?
Cmon man. Let’s be serious. If you’re suggesting that bitcoin has a unique and flawless governance model then you really need to educate oneself a bit more. Bitcoin has A governance model. It has one that set the benchmark for decentralised governance for sure. But it’s not without its flaws. Satoshi was not a god. 
Don’t tell people to disregard reality. We have religion for that.
No. OP — you have your own mind and ability to think for yourself. The best advice anyone can give you is to do your own research and ask the right questions. Don’t ever take someone’s opinion as gospel. Always question. Be the devil advocate. 
Learn how blockchain works. Learn where it breaks. Research alternative solutions and implementations. Understand the people. The companies. The politics. Look beyond crypto to decide where/if government and regulation has a place. Form unique opinions and don’t be so matter-of-fact. Be willing to not have all the answers and don’t be afraid to accept that there are no silver bullet cryptos out there.
Bitcoin is amazing. It’s going to be with us for a long long time and I want it to continue to succeed very much. But for fuck sake don’t become a basic sheep. There are too many people being brainwashed into the church of Bitcoin and it’s so incredibly damaging for Bitcoin and crypto more broadly. 
There was nothing wrong with your original portfolio provided you purchased those commodities know full well what they were. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Each it’s own story. Each it’s own utility. And guess what? Maybe none of them will be worth anything tomorrow. That’s the very real risk you take.

Pro tip. Don’t take advice from maximalists on reddit. If someone’s telling you shitcoin this, shitcoin that, then they probably don’t know what the fuck they are talking about anyway. Research each project, their objectives, implementation, community and core team and make your own decisions.
