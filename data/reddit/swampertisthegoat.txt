Don’t put in what you can’t afford to lose

I don’t wanna be that guy, but it seems like this past year whenever bitcoin seems stable, it’s really just a set up for another big drop. Hopefully this next drop is the last!

That’s fine. I have $0 in crypto this whole year. I haven’t lost a cent while people who are dollar cost averaging since the high thousands have lost a loooooot.

Rip all the people who fomo’d at 4K this past week

Nigga you got a crystal ball or something?

What in the fuck am I reading   
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:42:37
I am with you dude. I think the bottom is between 2000-3000. I love how everyone is now instantly a bull again. As if this fake rally hasn’t happened like 6 times since ATH last year just to go to even lower lows for the year.

The reason for bitcoins rise last year IMO was Russia, North Korea, and Venezuelan type countries using it to bypass sanctions. Russia also used crypto to pay for cyber ops to influence the American election. I think people aren’t thinking about this aspect enough. North Korea stole and used bitcoin to money launder millions for their rogue state.

Same lol. I want to see it fall to $2000. I have thousands of dollars waiting in my bank account to buy at a super low price. Not gonna buy until the price stabilized for at least a whole month. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:22:41
Very organic upticks guys, you’re all super duper smart! 
@_date: 2018-12-25 05:00:27
I said it before and I’ll say it again in spite of the downvotes from permabulls. It’s gonna be under 3k soon, it’ll probably bottom at 2k - 2.5k. Gonna try and buy a whole coin around there. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:58:45
I’ll be back around $2000 to see what the sentiment here is like 
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:09:21
All I’m saying is 6000 looked like a bottom and it was stable then all of a sudden the floor disappeared.

Dõmp ëtt

Way to jinx it you stupid fuck lol.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:03:45
If I miss the upswing that’s fine. I’d rather miss the upswing than buy in right now just for it to fall to $1000 and stay there for a year or two. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:58:56
I do believe myself lol. Keep fomoing tho 
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:23:21
Yeah there’s no chance what’s been going on isn’t manipulation by big whales. Not touching this with a 10 foot pole for a while. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:31:21
It’s gone up pretty strong this past year but it’s always found a true bottom. I’m not buying until it falls below 3k. If it ends up hitting 6k then I still won’t put in. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 19:07:53
I never even mentioned the energy argument, why are you bringing that up? The fact is that rogue nations like North Korea, Venezuela, and Russia are using crypto currency to bypass WTO sanctions. If you don’t like that, then ok. But just saying fake news is retarded. Good day sir. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:50:02
Not buying it. I put the bottom at $2000-$2500 going by -90% from ATH
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:01:07
I understand but I’ll start dca-ing once it hits the upper 2000’s. I won’t put in a dollar until it breaks that line.
