I see what you're saying based on the belief that bitcoin will keep rising. However, who is to say what bitcoin is for and what it's not. If this is going to work as we hope is because of the freedom it offers as opposed to centralized currencies. Why do you want to start limiting what people use bitcoin for? Some buy for speculation and investing profits. Some don't.

ETFs are a vehicle of investment. Most likely a price increase due to an increase in market share. An ETF would make it possible for many investment funds to purchase bitcoin (or bitcoin shares which have to be backed by bitcoin itself) as part of their investment portfolios. This would increase demand for coin and thus increase in price.

Sunk cost fallacy. You're letting the price you purchased at affect your decisions of buying/selling as if that price mattered anymore or the coins you bought at price x differ from coins you bought at price y. Once you bought now all you have is how much bitcoins you have and how much they're worth RIGHT NOW. If you believe it's going to keep dropping and then come back up why not sell and buy cheaper? You'd end up with more bitcoin than you started.

What open market exists without expectations of value or costumers? Something can be certainly overvalued but your explanation of it makes no sense. The ultimate value of anything is what someone else is willing to pay for it. Something can be certainly overvalued if you buy it but no one else will buy it from you at that price, but this is not the case.

Thanks for the response :). I agree hedging is a smart thing to do. Who knows what happens with these specific crypto currencies

Jesus, at one point the anchors couldn't hold back their teeth anymore and showed their intent to tear this guy apart. Looked like piranhas out there.

Depends on where you think it's going and how much money you have to invest. If you are holding I'm assuming you believe it will grow so I'd say keep putting money in periodically according to your income.

Keep depositing gradually and you'll have it soon. As you said below , if this thing becomes as big as we hope it will, one bitcoin will be huge. You have time until then. Keep chipping away :)

Did you create an account just to post this?
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:15:30
You have a good point. Who knows what will happen and it's very cheap right now.

Why do you want to eth? Genuinely curious

I see it as him giving the options. Not advocating either.  ;)

How so? Shouldn't we be attempting to make it something more than just a store of value/investment? If you want it to keep growing it has to actually be usable...

Can you please provide examples outside of this thread when gender has even come up in bitcoin discussion? I ask because in three months browsing this sub I've yet to run into it once. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:42:08
Doesn't this essentially make it an exchange? The whole point of using it was to keep it away from exchanges. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Can anyone verify this site

It's because you did an ach transfer directly from your bank. Use a card and it's instant.

I believe in the blockchain technology but you have to remember that bitcoin is just one iteration of it. It's like AOL was one application of the internet. There's a ton of risk to bitcoin and many many things could make it drop to nearly $0 It's like a penny stock with a ton of potential I'd say. There's a million investments safer than bitcoin, but none with this potential in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:40:51
I'd sell around 10k, invest in some other safer investments and keep putting in my weekly deposit to bitcoin. If this thing is going to become as big as we holders hope, anything we put in now will make us rich.

He has a knack for explaining it in a way we can understand. Just watched his podcast with Joe Rogan and he got me to, after many years of thinking about it and reading and backing out, to open my wallet and exchange some FIAT for some bitcoin. He's doing great work!
