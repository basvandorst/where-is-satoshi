It's a hard fork either way you look at it. Might as well fix everything that is wrong with Bitcoin before forking it. Think of it like replacing the space shuttle with the millennium falcon.

ELI5 version: So Satoshi was going bankrupt and he created Bitcoin to save him self.
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:11:17
At least the trust account prevents him from dumping those 1.2 million Bitcoins until 2020...Phew pump away!!!

This is getting very interesting.

Same time as Satoshi stopped posting on Bitcointalk
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:59:13
you can withdraw via the Blackcoin wallet as it functions fine ;)
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:46:36
Just make Bitcoin POS with 10 second conf, get rid of miners and make it an energy efficient coin like BlackCoin.

Zenpool total hash rate is 250GH and you have 2GH making you 0.8% of miners
@_date: 2014-11-05 06:11:22
Me too. Spent 2 BTC buying primes when they were $16. Sold them all for 4.8 BTC. Just treated them as penny stocks. GAW is dreaming if they think 1 hashcoin will be $20 in value

If you are going to Fork then while you are at it why not make it Proof of Stake and put a stop to all this mining nonsense. POS use less electricity and everyone makes money by staking their wallets. Seem like this 20MB increase is to serve some interests but not nobody cares about the earth!

That is because it does not contain wallet info for the 40,000 that have already been sold. The next court hearing is in September and this when you can expect the coins on that list to move.
