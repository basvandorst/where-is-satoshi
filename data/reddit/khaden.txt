True, you could do that. The thing I found interesting is this snippet about taxes in the FAQ. TLDR is that every time you buy/sell Bitcoin yourself, it's a taxable event and you'd have to pay short term/long term capital gains on each trade. If you hold one of these Sets, the rebalances that happen inside are likely to be considered black box trades depending on which jurisdiction you're in, meaning you're only liable for the buys and sells you make on the Set itself, and not the BTC inside the Set. Depending on how much you buy/sell BTC, that could be more money you hold yourself instead of letting it go to taxes.

If you want to educate yourself on Bitcoin as a technology, 'Mastering Bitcoin' is a great resource. It was originally written and open sourced by Andreas Antonopoulos.
