thank you for feedback
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:05:18
I believe you. Until the point I realise that any major retailer or entity can't pay taxes in bitcoins so they need to go into cash. boom
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:03:26
good luck. network backing up the system is not a backing of the system in terms of liquidity.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:17:36
Every retailer needs to pay taxes so and show profits to shareholders and I cant see it happening in bitcoins. so every company need to go into cash.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:05:01
imagine major retailer accepting 10% of bitcoins for their product. as bitcoin is no accountancy unit they will periodically need to cash out as they cant pay bitcoins into their suplly chain. Good luck for exchange of bitcoins who will need to have infinite amount of cash inflows to buy bitcoins from wall mart. 10 billion dollars in cash? you think this is not a problem for the market?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:00:02
shareholders cant pay taxes in bitcoins, it is not a legal tender
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:43:01
I do not have hatred for governments. I am only disgusted by unconstitutional theft and blatant robbery.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:53:07
Yes you are right and I am not against bitcoin. But I believe that would be true if the rise in price was gradual and slow. And capital has enough time to create liquidity, and hedging market for risk appropriation. That didn't happen and no legal framework. Either way it is not a legal tender. any public company will need to cash out to close to books and hit dolar earnings per share benchmarks. or you believe shareholders are going to love bitcoins in yearly statements? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:30:26
believing in something which relates to wealth preservation doesn't sound smart to me. More during times when governments strive for every penny from taxes. I must say you are dreaming a very bad dream.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:18:02
What I mean by that is they are more easy to gamble and have higher motivation to get out as their investment is growing exponentially in proportion to their capital commitment. It is different trade some asset for 1 mln. when you mined the bitcoins and when you bough bitcoins. The propensity to stay is different in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:14:44
yes I understand. But you dont know where they want to get the cash, on which exchnage, and as the settlement time as in futures markets is not set ahead you face liquidity crunch all the time.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:43:41
cash2crypto&gt; i am not questioning complexity of bitcoin. I am questioning liquidity and going into cash as I am a trader and those markets represent some sort of backup you need to run it constituently, bitcoin doesn't have capital backup. Or any other provider of liquidity besides the actual cash sitting on particular exchange to buy bitcoins.
What is complex about the settlement of bitcoin? please elaborate more on that and I would love to discuss.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:53:49
yes I understand market depth as I was trading derivative markets. and that is why futures exchanges settle cash every day account against account until delivery notice day where both parties agree to settle on a predetermined date""" and that is crucial. this is what will crash bitcoin exchanges as anyone going out when the price rises will have exponential more need for new ready people enter bitcoin market with cash. or other speculators jumping in and out who are adding only to higher volatility what you dont want to see during exit
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:08:36
so you expect mass adoption them by companies?
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:33:40
Yes it can. I talk about it in other articles about bitcoin. I am not a proponent of bitcoin, I am outlining risks mostly
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:16:29
And moreover. You expect fiat to be replaced by bitcoin? Fed is printing 85 billion dollars monthly. Do you know what is the size of fiat market? trillions of dollars. Size of bitcoin market is 15 billion. And state doesn't like to be paid in bitcoins and every company needs to pay taxes.
If we expect it to stay small market without retail ok. But otherwise I see problem there.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:00:58
yes they are. and are facing a liquidity crunch in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:10:09
you need to understand that if you want retail to join they are having accountancy problem where they need to transfer to cash in certain periods otherwise they would have problems with closing their books. so to say. you have huge problem any huge company with big revenue periodically cashing out billions in cash. they ned cash to buy their supply chain where they cant do it with bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:02:43
yes and it is connected like this&gt; they need to go into cash , I mean companies, and that creates time imbalances on local bitcoin exchanges because you never know why with what volume, what is different from exchanges I have explained in the article and so creates risk. You may dismiss it but it is there.

sorry for that I was copy pasting it from my blog. I didnt mean to bother
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:11:32
you obviously don't understand that if you don't have enough timely cashflow the whole system is broken and waiting for catastrophe? You better understand what you are talking about and check how SS is underfunded
The Social Security System has an unfunded liability of $18 trillion. This means our politicians have promised $18 trillion more than they can possibly pay out
The Social Security system had a negative cashflow of $47.8 billion last year, after running a $48 billion deficit the year before.
I guess you understand how much 18 trillion is.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:13:02
Yes. time will tell. I see that it will be catastrophic.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:00:28
Do you expect that any major retailer can pay taxes in bitcoins? if we expect mass adopsption? so to say they will cash out.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:59:36
OK. So first of all every retailer needs to close his books, show results to shareholders and so cash out of the market as I do not expect that we can pay taxes in bitcoins. so to say they need to cash out. 
furthemore the retailer that would get most of bitcoins in a fastest possible way will have control over profit margins of all other holding bitcoins, and as they all need to cash out to close books and pay taxes it will be a race who will cash out first
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:25:06
because they do not know if apple walmart or any other bigger retailer wants to cash out because of taxes, you will never know because of anonymity and companies can't allow to take risks about profit margins if they take business seriously. The risk of concentration and someone cashing out and dropping price ahead of you.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:36:05
if you argument holds true then I believe they will hold until the price reaches one million. At this moment you expect no one to cash out? 
imagine major retailer accepting 10% of bitcoins for their product. as bitcoin is no accountancy unit they will periodically need to cash out as they cant pay bitcoins into their suplly chain. Good luck for exchange of bitcoins who will need to have infinite amount of cash inflows to buy bitcoins from wall mart. 10 billion dollars in cash? you think this is not a problem for the market?
that cash will go out of the system and never back. rinse repear rinse repeat and the exchange is bust.

No it is not. Sorry for grammar mistakes. I am not a native speaker nor do I live in english speaking country.

Imagine any major retailer joining bitcoin and having to close his books and pay taxes at the end of the year. They need to get cash.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:46:30
thank you for feedback. I am having delays in possibility to comment as I reply a lot and I am new to reddit . I can't thank all the people giving feedback negative or positive.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:15:52
No it is not because the rise in price got ahead of capital infrastructure where you lack stability of liquidity or have players which are committed to supplement liquidity. It will go wrong in my opinion but I hold fingers crossed for all other in bitcoin. For me it is a ponzi structure that got more visible when the price is high as less people can questions exchange liquidity when trading for 3 bugs for bitcoin, and $1000 for btc
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:53:08
Yes you are true about it. But you expect the price to rise exponentially or no? that is my feeling from bitcoin owners. The more bigger player join, the harder for public to get in for good price and they would be hostages of biggest holders.
 But then when you expect major retail adoption you need companies to pay taxes. So they need to go into cash as shareholders do not like to be presented in bitcoins and capital structure needs to be backed by profits otherwise they cant do business. So to say they need to cash out. 
As they do not know which retail player has how much of the market thanks to anonymity, they want to cash out first not to face steep price decline on local bitcoin exchange. Imagine google apple joining in and how would they feel about their margins being dependent on other big bitcoin holders when all of big companies will need to exit into cash. Liquidity problem as you do not have balanced liquidity during time. Like you have in futures, forex etc.

Up until now, retirees have been taking out more than they put in, and that can't continue — this pattern relied on finding ever more workers to join the system
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:15:23
I believe I have good feeling towards all the people and I dont judge. Either way I am not responsible for previous generations that they believed in ponzi scheme in the first place. I didn't commit to their beliefs in predetermined end, mathematically. 
My expression of feeling to people who lie to themselves would not change anything about actual situation of the system. I believe that honesty and correct funding of system creates trust.
the sooner we will realise it is a trick the sooner we can demand change and not to threaten that our children will end as tax slaves.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:44:32
sorry. I nave pasted it in caps from my blog. sorry for that. I don't see myself important.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:38:33
no you dont need everyone to cash out. you need small amount of big holders to cash out to either bust the price or wait until there are enough cash account on particular exchange to buy in. the higher the price the higher the needs for new cash to supplement the same level of liquidity. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:02:47
imagine google or any bigger company involved cashing out down the road? liquidity is not a concern? and they need to go to cash as I have stated above. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:50:12
bitcoin isn't accountancy unit. you need to cash out if you are publicly traded company. or you think shareholders would like to be presented with millions of bitcoins at year end statement? And not pay taxes from it? keep dreaming. and if they hold on to bitcoin, the retailer who gets biggest share has power over profit margins of everyone in bitcion. So you can drop the price affter you cash out. I see retailers wanting to join this gable..
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:16:29
One the price rises to 1000 dolars a bitcoin tou need twice as much new cash to buy bitcoin to hold same level of liquidity. Every major company wanting to join needs to pay taxes and so will cash out of the market yearly and the more bitcoins you have the bigger power over other companies profit margins.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:04:09
Can any major retailer pay taxes in bitcoins? I dont think so. Boom. cashing out is must for them.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:47:42
yes. still it is backed by faith but at least with one more thing. ability of the state to force people to pay taxes. and so you have revenue backup. that is the difference.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:11:19
Every larger retailer wold need to cash out to close the books yearly and get cash. Why do you think the busted bitcoins by US entities would not serve as tool for price manipulation. I don't think I would be dumb to exit if it rises to one million for one bitcoin and I was only basement miner. Taxes taxes taxes. this is not a legal tender and so is poised for liquidity crunch
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:11:25
I wish best of luck with that. Until taxes are paid in fiat. But time will tell. 
and furthermore because of anonymity, how would revenue agencies control taxes when now in economic crisis I somehow can’t see how government would trust that certain company has only one wallet and no other hidden.
Thanks for feedback
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:56:37
in my opinion bitcoiners are dreaming a dream. you see somewhere nations allowing to get anonymous payments for major products? you see them losing control over 100 years investing in banking cartel? you think they will lend the power to bitcoiner?
imagine major retailer accepting 10% of bitcoins for their product. as bitcoin is no accountancy unit they will periodically need to cash out as they cant pay bitcoins into their suplly chain. Good luck for exchange of bitcoins who will need to have infinite amount of cash inflows to buy bitcoins from wall mart. 10 billion dollars in cash? you think this is not a problem for the market?
that cash will go out of the system and never back. rinse repear rinse repeat and the exchange is bust.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:59:16
thank you for feedback. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:50:56
:| that is shortsighted in my opinion if you want to compare it to some other medium of payments. State would not allow to pay companies salaries in bitcion...and furthemore you expect wallmart employees to understand it? I can see wallmart crypto fans lining up
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:42:50
Yes but that I do not own it doesn't change anything about what I have said. Please be specific if you want to judge . I have 10 years of derivatives trading experience and understand what liquidity means in long term. Thanks
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:30:51
Thanks for feedback. much appreciated
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:21:45
Probably I am trading 10 years :} . and that is why I have compared markets with real infrastructure against no capital infrastrucre in bitcoin market.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:50:24

@_date: 2013-12-03 18:20:40
If any major company joins, they need to pay taxes in fiat and so they need to go into cash, the more you sell the more bitcoins you get and so it is fight to have major market share and have power over others. with limited amount of final number of bitcoins, any major player would try to buy in first and have control. it is self defeating game until bitcoins are accepted as legal tender.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:46:38
Yes you are true. That is why I have elaborated on more aspects&gt;

@_date: 2013-12-03 22:01:02
Yes I imagine. But right after that I again think about taxes and internet adoption rate.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:16:14
yes but as I have said you need to pay taxes in fiat so you constantly face liquidity problem as you don't know who wants to go out at what time. There is a big issue with every price it will be more visible.

@_date: 2013-12-03 19:13:34
I do not see you can buy a lot of stuff for them. And any major retailer getting in will create huge and constant demand for cash as they need to pay taxes and close their books for shareholders. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:06:28
Thanks for feedback. Yes I know what you mean. Until we expect major retail joining the market as they have to pay taxes and close their books and so go out of the market.
I don't see any major adoption at the moment  to expect that I can stay in bitcoin infinitely.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:04:36
imagine any major retailer joining in. bitcoin is not an accountancy unit, you need to cash out. imagine wall mart cashing in and out 10 billions monthly. governments holds you by the guts
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:45:56
so your arguments confirms, that it needs very little for any major bitcoin retailer to get all the bitcoins in very short time. I didn't want to exagerate but that market is poised to liquidity crunch in my opinion. it is nive to expect that no major holder wants to cash out if we continue to rise exponentially expecting mass adoption.
