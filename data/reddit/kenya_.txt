Was it a dank pizza though?

Exactly, if anything it is just experimenting for me.

I have yet to check out bitmarket but i will as soon as i finish typing this'. My mom has been nagging me to sell all my old trading cards but i havent gotten around to it. Could i sell them there?

Stock investing has always interested me but i never had enough confidence in any stocks to invest in them. I feel confident in btc. I think it will be a good place to start atleast. Even if i don't succeed i will learn valuable lessons.

Im sorry but i dont remember, i believe i found it via this subreddit. Sorry i cant provide.

So far from what i've read it is going to come muchhhh quicker than everyone expected if btc continue to blowup

I have no proof it does or that it was accurate so i guess not. All im saying is i read it.

Very good point! I considered this but unfortunately my parents don't see the future in bitcoins and wont allow me to make this drastic of an investment :/ 
PS- Doesn't really matter but i don't drink (:

Very good advice, i really just want to be a part of it before the production limit is reached.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:06:19
I've considered this but i haven't really thought of anything yet. Appreciate the feedback!

I will be spending a lot of time with this, thank you very much for putting me onto it.

I mean i like the concept of having enough money to be comfortable without worry, I think bitcoins COULD be a way i achieve that. If not it will still be a beneficial experience i think. But also I like bitcoins because they just make so much more sense to me than any other kind of money. Like Donald Glover said, “Being backed by gold seems very old and nostalgic to me. Being backed to a bitcoin, which takes time to actually make and there’s this equation that has to be done, that feels realer to me and makes more sense.”

People seem to think I intend to "get rich quick". I did not mean to come across like this. I have always been interested in investing (stocks) but was never confident enough in any to invest my money into. Bitcoins is the first sure thing i've come across (or what seems sure).
