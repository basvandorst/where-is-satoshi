But sorry to hear it, mate. Hope they are caught and what you lost is restored.

3) literal ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2012-04-18 08:21:37
Ok, well let me start by saying I'm only pointing out the possibility for one, not saying I have turned up evidence of one here.  
The important part of a ponzi scheme is that you are taking more people on than are leaving your business.  Have more than a handful of clients and don't have to keep really transparent records?  Promise 20% return, you can deliver it to a select few on the front-end.  They receive 20% and tell their friends, "no shit, I got 20% interest."  Others join and put their money into the pot.  Not many take it out--who doesn't want to be making 20% interest?!  The few that take it out over time are given what they are owed, and as time goes on reinforce the delusion that you really are making enough on every dollar to give back 20% interest.  You aren't though.  You are just using the money.

My comment was made with a light-heart.  But honestly when we are talking returns of 120%, I think it deserves space with those other two options for how they are making money.

I don't fully understand the cryptographic intricacies of the "replay attack" well enough to say. I do know that as I have seen that evidence presented it's not self evident, and more its been offered with an assertion and labeled an attack. I prefer self evident and presented sans conclusion. When the experts are split, you are especially in need of those things.

I have never known someone adept in a domain like cryptography to the point of being a virtuoso that didn't suffer from problems in some other domain like social. It's almost like life is on a skill point system where everyone starts with a similar fixed amount to plug in to different attributes. I think these actions could fit with either profile here.

I agree with its being an attractive idea. The only reason i know to consider this is that I myself appreciated the intrigue or mystique and was mildly annoyed at the idea of it panning out this way. But whether or not it's now, if and when the time comes, we won't really have a choice but to give it fair consideration so long as our concern is the truth. We can't very well ruin someone's life--wacko or no--just to make the eventual movie's plot cooler.

Well, a lot of joy here and fulfilled expectation. I hope you guys are right. And who am I to say otherwise, I certainly am no authority. But I haven't seen much positive evidence for this guy being a con man. Certainly not of the caliber/quality of evidence you are demanding in the other direction. I come out if this with the distinct sensation many very much *want* there to be no Satoshi. Not now, not ever. Certainly not this one. But in my experience great minds live in complicated people further in complicated situations. Does yours differ?  Say he wasn't a con man. Just imagine it for a moment. Do you even doubt a genuine response like this might be the result?

Legalize it! Finally. And hopefully medicinal bitcoin will be legal in several US states by the end of the year.  What a time to be alive!

A person who has room only for strongest evidence outside of narrative gets more than my understanding. I respect that perspective greatly.  The problem I have is not with those people who apply utmost skepticism everywhere.  Instead it is with those who apply it only in situations to suit their desire or need. I have seen the many *claims* of deception. But none of them have been delivered with the burdens for evidence in quality and quantity as is asked in the other direction. People are saying in one direction, "I don't want to consider the bullshit circumstances just show me the hard evidence" toward his claim and those same people are saying, "consider the circumstances, he's a clear scam artist" toward the idea of his being a con man. There is just this huge discrepancy. I am open to the idea there could be quality evidence out there in this direction that i haven't seen, but I haven't seen it as I have watched this all unfold and it certainly wasn't presented anywhere here at 100 comments. If it comes off that I am strongly challenging the majority idea expressed here, I don't mean to. I don't have a strong opinion. I am just pointing out something I do see here, a problem in inconsistent rigor and logic in general.

Why does your comment show the edit asterisk but theirs does not?  Was theirs fast enough to be a ninja edit? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:58:16
Yeah, I saw:


Just wondering what the difference between your two edits was.  I didn't know that you could make an edit that substantial without the asterisk showing up.  I guess it's just about how much time has elapsed.
