Agreed, I was out of hand. I just hate how crypto talks always somehow derail into conspiracy theories.

To ruin the arguement:
We are talking about the world economy where hundreds of trillions are changing hands. All in fiat. I would say that 2 trillion is a drop in the bucket for a pool that big.

Wackos like you are the ones stopping people from full adoption. I will never touch crypto because of the absolute morons that preach for it.
The smart ones are making money off of the sheep that buy into their shitcoins.
But yes keep focusing on that “leftist agenda”
My point: you can’t compare the market cap of a currency built on air, to the laundering of money in the world economy.

GDP is not the same thing as what I was describing
@_date: 2019-07-27 19:58:11
The money is all around the bitcoin not in it. These morons just love getting played

It will be worth $100 in a year

What are you trying to accomplish?
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:43:24
Lmao all of crypto has lost its shine, enjoy the pipe dream 
@_date: 2018-10-17 01:41:36
All of these made life easier, how will bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:40:50
How the fuck is crypto gonna go mainstream if it requires software engineering to understand.
@_date: 2018-10-17 00:25:08
That’s some great anecdotal evidence. Really shows mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:48:13
Na thats a false equivalency. You still don’t have a full adoption of the internet. Are you really expecting a 60yr old to use crypto?

Guy is a fucking retard. Thinks the gold standard is coming back and follows Q.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:56:12
Once it becomes a currency.
@_date: 2017-04-12 05:07:31
This whole USAF thing that's been going on for a week now. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 04:43:21
Everyone loves bitching about this or that. I have no skin in the game and all this freaking out is getting old. It's a wonder why it's not a currency with it being this volatile. Just a stupid lurkers $.02

Shhh your supposed to act like this is a currency, and rip on the system that actually works.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:18:15
No, just making fun of the way you type. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:08:38
Not trying to change your mind........................ (that’s sarcasm in case you didn’t realize)
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:49:20
Lmao you are off your fucking rocker
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:34:06


@_date: 2018-12-23 23:11:34
Or because it has no daily use
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:07:48
For 99% of people
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:29:34
No, it just has no use.
It would be best to spend it now than later. Cuz it’s worth something now.
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:08:20
God these memes are complete shit
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:06:56
I concede
I have been bested
