I am surprised yet no-one has proposed some kind of BTC fork that would move the mining from PoW to PoS. Could be a great idea for someone to do this, using the “climate change” argument, and calling it something like “BTC green”. Terrible idea?

Interesting theory but what do you have to show to prove it’s not just speculation?

Thanks sir, will put this on the reading list for the weekend.

So you think the motivation is a monetary and economic one, rather than a practical one?

 Can someone honestly explain what's the difference between the impending eEuro and the eUSD compared to the digital euros and dollars I currently use? I never use paper money just digital cash - so what's the difference between the current digital items that I use versus the eEuro and the eUSD they're referring to here? Isn't currency digital for most intents and purposes anyway?

Ladies &amp; gents,
We’re near the 61.8 after 5 waves up on the weekly.
People are losing their shit of course – they typically love to go bearish near a 61.8 correction for some reason.
But that is all this is – a correction.
I thoroughly expect a bottom at the $7.2k area with perhaps a brief wick down to $6.8k Then UPWARDS.
Also – the HALVING MATTERS.
BTC rose too quickly this time (as it often does) and is correcting. Price at the last halving was around $660 and thus around 57% of the then-previous ATH of approximately $1.2k.
If we mirror this then BTC should be around $11.3k for the next halving (57% x $19.8k). Price increased  too rapidly due to FOMO, is now correcting to the 61.8 and will then gradually rise to at least $11.3k by mid-May.
Do I think this will happen? Yes. Can I be wrong? Of course. BTC is an unruly beast, but from a fundamentals perspective things have never looked rosier, you don’t want to be shaken out before the real gains are made.

Stamp and Kraken both decent.
