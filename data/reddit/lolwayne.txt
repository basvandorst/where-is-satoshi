Your Bitcoin wallet will have a QR code for receiving btc. You should be prompted to hold a smartphone up to a sensor. Good luck.

Seriously??? That is absolutely 100% false. I got to the restaurant around 5pm. I was excited to see the ATM to my immediate right. 
The place was pretty empty and I was approached by someone from the restaurant right when I got in. I said I wanted to use the ATM and he said that it was out of operation and didn't know when it would be running. 
Why would I make up this experience? You're not going to win any customers by lying.

If you were in the back of the restaurant for 5 hours that doesn't mean you were there all day......come on. 
Might have just been bad luck for me but I was at Flat 128 at 12:30pm and the front door was locked. Have you been to that location? Is there a trick to get into the store? The store's door is behind a door that required you to be buzzed in because it is residential too and I had no luck entering. 
In all honesty I just wanted to exchange dollars for bitcoin and wasted 2 hours trying so I am frustrated.

I wouldn't add it just yet. Very frustrated that it was not running after making the trip to the location. Restaurant employees said I couldn't use it and that they didn't know when it would be running when I visited today around 5pm. PYCBTC is blatantly lying about being at the location all day.
Earlier in the day, I tried to visit the other Manhattan ATM (Flat 128) using the Hours provided on your site and as well as the store's site but it was also closed. All in all I probably wasted 2 hours today.
I've never purchased BTC and was hoping today would be the day.

This is somewhat off topic but can you explain the difference to me between keeping my coins in a wallet with coinbase vs using breadwallet? Specifically security wise but also functionally.

Really? Cause when I went today it was not in operation. 
Thanks for wasting my time. Very poor form.
