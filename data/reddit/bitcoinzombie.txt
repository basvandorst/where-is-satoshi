The threat was telling the public. I feel it was warranted. Explain how it isn't?

I just started attempting to day trade on btc-e, and hate how it eats up all the gains on ~$5 swings :(
tips for a newb would be greatly appreciated, as to what exchanges to use or, arbitrage, trading tips etc.

I agree with you mostly, except we have to face the fact that Algorithm trading is going on, and thats what todays minor pop was due to, if you look at the chart, it wants to bubble back up, I just measured all sell days to buy days since Dec 15th 12, and we have 49% more buy days  than sales days...
Suggesting several scenarios; either most people are buying intending to hold, most people aren't selling yet, most of the sales are panic sales, institutional investors may be buying it up slowly to cause a big crash.
Also if you notice the time of last nights flash crash, 2am pst. 90% of all of North America was sleeping, it dropped to 55, then a massive buy came in and drove it back to 65, in .5 seconds, and now its been struggling to break past 68 all day. Due to the Algo's and ppl being scared of past trends, thinking this market is like Anything we've seen before...
Today was a lesson with how a well timed attack can affect the price for a day, or days... This time next week, I expect it to be back on track, with what we saw over the last few days... Once Havlock makes Shorts available... These daily swings are going to get bumpier!

as USUAL Downvoted for trying to bring the truth about an active, corrupt "Tragedy capitalizer" like the Red Cross. Ignorance Is BLISS
I wish people would stop being willfully ignorant to the truth. Instead of downvoting this post, simply do a little research, before giving your money and faith away to the one global private Charity with its hand out every time a disaster strikes.
"ABC news asked the Red Cross why it was sitting on a few hundred million dollars of funds for Haiti and they responded by explaining that it's better to dole out the money slowly for the best impact. OR, could it be that the interest helps fatten their own bank accounts or, perhaps over time, people will stop keeping track of how much they're holding from people who've so generously given to the Haitian effort?
Very carefully and very softly the media will mention how slowly the flow of funds from places like the Red Cross seem to trickle in, this even after billions were donated world wide for earthquake relief.
A few years back the Red Cross was scrutinized for putting a massive amount of funds into their infrastructure for things like remodeling and new computers they said they needed to grow their efforts in the months and years following the massive amounts their received world wide after 9/11.
While the media doesn't report very aggressively about the greed and shadiness of this organization, they will mention it from time to time, but the Red Cross is such a sacred cow that you'll likely never see a major news network or newspaper go after them aggressively.
If you give, give to other national or international charities associated with the quake. If you must donate to the Red Cross, try to do so directly with the Japanese Red Cross and keep your money away from the U.S. and International Red Cross organizations.
This organization is crooked, greedy and dishonest at its core, I have no doubt about it."- some random guy on the internet ;)

The Magic Bed Bugs
On Feb. 22nd 2013 I put $1500 under my mattress.
On March 11th I took that money back out and it magically gained $800,
SHOCKED, I Quickly put that $1500 back under, and paid the Rent!
There were magic bed bugs under my mattress...
The sad thing was, 17 of them Died under my bed. Only 30 Remained.
...The saddest thing they told me was, if I had waited 15 years they would have made me $47,000,000 Bills...

Agreed, based on my research they seem to have a 4-1 or 1-1 take on donation campaigns that they run. Most of it gets reabsorbed into the "General Fund" and is then used somewhere else like CEO pay or fundraising, with very little accountability or transparency.
They are vampires who prey on the ignorance of people who want to help people in need, suffering from a tragedy. It's disgusting that our world allows this to continue.

"The Red Cross has taken its share of heat over its handling and channeling of funds. 
A highly critical Los Angeles Times article (“The Red Cross Money Pit,” Richard M. Walden) makes several damning points: that the Red Cross received 70 percent of Katrina funds; it is reimbursed for shelters, food, etc. by the federal government; it relies overwhelmingly on unpaid volunteers; and it spends over $111 million a year in fund raising. Quoting Walden, “The Red Cross expects to raise more than $2 billion before Hurricane Katrina-related giving subsides. If it takes care of 300,000 people, that’s $7,000 per victim. I doubt each victim under Red Cross care will see more than a doughnut, an interview with a social worker and a short-term voucher for a cheap motel, with a few miscellaneous items such as clothes and cooking pots thrown in.” In addition, it sells donated blood for around $1.5 billion annually. His obvious question is, “Where does the money go?” [The article]( makes for fascinating reading.

I think you are using seriously flawed logic. I sent them thousands of dollars, and barely heard a word. Printed their wire instructions, and sent a substantial sum of money from my bank, how is my response not fair, would you rather not know about how shady Kraken really is?? Thanks for your constructive input friend!

IF we all go all in, and the media hypes it, we can all make money, while the sleeping giants suffer, it's a positive feedback loop, the entire world will run to bitcoins in a matter of months....
People ALWAYS forget they can place a stop loss order, with a max loss you can tollerate, be it 20% loss or 10% profit... eg. buy at 38 SELL at 40!... Problem solved, we all protect our butts against manipulation, we exit and enter again when we SEE massive value/potential to preserve our wealth.
Pump it up, with all OUR funds, make small sales on the build up to the pop, sell high to recover your initial investment, if you want to be extra safe.... **Live off the Deflationary profit.**

As long as it has more Hype and Innovation driving it, IT WILL trend up regardless,of daily instability now, if the trend is year over year exponential gains, everyone will be using bitcoin.
Thus, we the early adopter 10% get the most benefit from dumping everything we have into bitcoins then forming our own bitcoin economy offering 15% discounts in bitcoin payment for example.
It will be like a Utopia virus, if we all just believe!

LOL, you ask me for evidence and I already provided it! Though I appreciate your red herring, I already showed how monopoly men like Soros sell their paper, to manipulate the price.
As did Bill Murphy in the video you supplied. Why his bombshell evidence was significant is that the U.S. likely owns NONE of its 'Gold,' to understand why that is significant... Audit the Fed ;)
Derivatives, Options, ETF's, Bonds. -Levers used for currency and Gold price manipulation.
Face it, we live in a world where nearly every commodity that is traded, has a cartel behind the scenes fixing the price. You think Gold has immunity to the same price fixing seen in Banana's, Diamonds, Chocolate or Oil? Give me a break! Bitcoin, atleast gives us the ability to jump ship if too many Hedgefunds jump in at once.
