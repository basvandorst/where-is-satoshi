your parents have less time to make up for mistakes if they take risks. they have a strategy that has worked well for them and they're smart to stick to it. they have risk avoidant habits because they have responsibilities they can't drop (ex: paying for you)
you on the other hand have tons of time to make up for mistakes and almost no responsibilities. you also have a different worldview (one that is being optimized for 10-30 years in the future hopefully) while your parent's worldview works pretty well for the past 15 years and probably pretty ok for right now. 
you should just eat the 9% fees, invest aggressively, and make sure you're not storing it all in one place. by the time you need it (age 30+) 9% fees will seem really unimportant. 
convincing your parents of anything at 15 is pointless. try to convince a teacher or better yet your peers.

I didn't tell op to follow the same strategy that brought their parents success. I told them their parents were different people with their own good reasons for their strategy. Op is also their own person with a different set of constraints and should do what they know is better for themselves while at the same time respecting that their parents make different decisions for mostly good reasons.

inflation sure SEEMS pretty bad if you're middle class or higher in many countries in south america where inflation can go from 5-10% to 200% or more literally overnight. International banks stop accepting your country's currency for your mortgage. Government response is to default on all debt and create a new currency. 
This kind of thing actually happens with some regularity in south america. So yea, I guess you're right inflation does make you "look for returns"

no, argentina's government is very corrupt and makes bad decisions like implementing capital controls but argentina's value is still in its citizens and so it does make some attempt to maintain an educated middle class.
Venezuela's greatest value is it's oil, which doesn't need an educated middle class to extract. Their elite don't have to take care of their citizens at all to maintain wealth...so they don't. Venezuela also attempts to set prices on basic goods like flour and milk without correctly subsidizing the supply side so it all goes into a resale black market. Venezuela ALSO has 2+? currencies (bolivar and petro) and they are hyperinflating the most commonly used currency, the bolivar.
It's not one bad problem or even a few like argentina has. Venezuela is a perfect storm of financial societal collapse.

by "we" do you mean the us or the usd?
the article is about south america, south american currencies, south american economies and what south americans are doing to avoid inflation and usd capital controls.
maybe inflation isn't bad. according to you, maybe it's not even real. but in south america people are avoiding it. 
i don't think the problems with the eu are 100% comparable. the biggest problem with the eu imo is national budgets but union level currency decisions (inflation etc). in south america the same entities make both decisions but still end up with catastrophic inflation occasionally.

cryptocurrencies not controlled by their government (aka not the petro) will give individuals a safe haven store of value when other currencies (bolivar) hyperinflate. 
crypto can't do everything though, like 
\- when you can't buy bread because there isn't enough volume in the market
\- when infrastructure like roads, electricity, and water fail because the taxes+wages trick doesn't balance out and employees don't show up 
idealism and hodling don't matter too much. you're just trying to feed your family.
culture affects value of a currency and the average person just can't adapt fast enough. venezuela has the bolivar and the petro and they're talking about a new bolivar or some kind of fiat reset. there's no clear solution to basic fiscal problems like wages, rent, and groceries. there's definitely not any legal solution. using a blackmarket and/or circumventing capital controls on some level is probably something most people do just to survive there.
if people get desperate enough to learn then yes, something like bitcoin would help immensely...IF price fixing enforcement by the government stops which i wouldn't count on. otherwise it really only helps a few smart people who are probably also smart enough to just leave if they can.

That's not entirety true. You can setup a recurring withdrawal as well. In my experience all recurring actions run at the same time but with a 1 day delay you can buy and then withdraw. You could set it up to be daily and your risk of loss if something happens to coinbase is only 1-2 days of investment.

I think this is the most accurate opinion I've read about the mtgox situation.
Why hasn't Mark hired a core developer or hired and groomed a frequent committer.
At the very least, where is the careers page on mtgox?
Is the ceo of mtgox really also its lead developer?
I have the suspicion that almost every line of code, image resource, and icon were made by Mark Karples and that he is the only one who could recover coins from cold storage. I think Mark is trying to solve every problem with a technical solution that he himself writes when a business solution would have been better. Like hiring someone to manage mtgox public image or keeping an eye out for well implemented new exchanges that he might buy to take their talent or even just flat out rebrand their site as mtgox?

Just don't question it like people don't sit around wondering how they help the USD by having $20k in the bank. They're just like, cool, got some money, better hang onto this for later. It's not like "when am I gonna dump this $20k USD for Euros?" Or even "how can I help USD beat the euro?"
Just save like normal and spend when you have to, or when it's convenient, or whenever really. 
Bitcoin doesn't really need your help anymore. It's not a charity cause. It doesn't need any external motivators or help. People will help it incidentally to make a profit just like the dollar or gold or whatever.

Fiat and banking require immense trust. So do other 3rd parties like cc companies and payment companies. The trust is in everyone involved(lots of points for failure) and government/society to punish those who violate that trust and provide some recompense if possible. 
The Japanese government is fulfilling that trust in whatever way they can by investigating and prosecuting those responsible (I assume).

People should read the FBI document. It's very tame and almost completely accurate.
Politicians will probably be drama queens about it, but from reading the paper myself, it's pretty straight forward in explaining what bitcoin is with regards to the work the FBI does without expressly condemning bitcoin. It does fairly directly say something like "we can't shut it down" to make it clear that a court order+swat team can't be used to handle illegal use of bitcoin unlike something like egold or whatever. Which is true and objective and something someone in that line of work should know.
It's actually a pretty good paper to pass to the next person who asks you why bitcoin isn't a scam/has value/etc. This kind of legitimizes bitcoin even more.

it's basically to train people to provide computational power for the network, which is needed now to verify transactions, and will be needed on a greater scale as the network grows. At that point it will be common to pay minute amounts to transfer funds that will more or less be "shared" as a reward for running the network. in the same way the 50btc payouts are now shared(that is not a continuously even split, but over time, statistically evenly distributed)

I love how almost every article about bitcoin at some point says "it's not really worth anything." Isn't such an evaluation up to the people earning and purchasing with bitcoin? Stating that its value is unregulated and determined purely by market forces would let the reader decide whether such a thing is valuable or not.
maybe this isn't the place but I just had to get that out

They won't pay government employee wages in bitcoins? Or pay contractors to build bridges or fighter jets or pay for health care? Governments don't typically have problems with hoarding too much money.
If a large enough government required that taxes be paid in bitcoins, there would be an unimaginably large price bubble, there would be riots as the price rose exponentially after taxes had been assessed but before paid, as people would not be able to obtain enough to pay their taxes. It would be absolutely disastrous for a government to do this.
Allowing people to pay taxes in bitcoins would raise the price, but it would stay relatively stable compared to the other situation.
Any attempt to collect significant amounts of bitcoins would cause a speculation bubble, bitcoin can't be ended so easily.

pretty decent and tempered explanation of bitcoin. Her statement that bitcoin wouldn't catch on in a big way because it was too difficult to use was thought provoking and valid for now if not the future. The same could be said of lots of technologies though, we all use countless protocols that most of us don't really understand. That's probably a good way to describe bitcoin, a monetary protocol. The USD would be another, more analog monetary protocol, but credit cards and physical currency that represents it are really what make it usable. The end was a bit frustrating. I kept wanting to answer the "what is it/what do you get/etc" questions. The answers to questions like that are tedious though. People don't question what they "really get" when they get a paycheck from work, though. The answer to those questions would be equally tedious.

mining is over for anyone who isn't going to devote to it as a business. there's a thin margin.
the real currency issues for argentineans are
* how to purchase things outside the country/move money outside the country. they have increasingly shrinking options for doing this, basically credit cards with a high conversion %
* how to save with a currency that inflates 30% a year(and they fear that inflation will go up), when they cannot legally purchase other currencies. people in argentina save in foreign currencies in PAPER in safety deposit boxes. 
* the govt has a history of "nationalizing" bank funds. the government could decide to audit the safety deposit boxes where they keep their savings(in usd or euro). That would mean widescale...i don't even know...but um, the argentinean govt has made bad decisions in the past.
bitcoin solves all these problems, and it's even legal(at this point)!!

This guy seems quite smart, and makes some interesting points, however
His proposal to flag bitcoins controlled by all of these associated addresses as invalid and ignore them on the blockchain is completely contrary to the design and even the spirit of bitcoin. For one thing, this is all based on one paper. Assuming he's right, he's suggesting flagging someone's earning invalid for scraping together a measly 240k usd in bitcoins. This shows a severe lack of perspective on the scale of wealth and how little money 240k usd really is. There are a plethora of counter arguments, where do we draw the line for "too rich", do you really want to start a witchhunt based on such supposition? is it justified even if it were correct?
Luckily, we don't have to consider such things, because the core bitcoin design is not going to change, and that's one of its greatest values.

yep. bitcoin's most valuable quality is not that it can be exchanged for dollars, that's where skeptics miss the point. its most valuable quality is that it is extremely predictable and stable over the long term. decentralization is a part of what makes it stable. its exchange rate may change unpredictably over short periods due to mood, but the elements of bitcoin are known and unchangeable functions. 
you could say that bitcoin is a basic element of an economy assuming no magically extreme advances in computing(i mean really really extreme).
@_date: 2012-03-26 05:31:06
From the general perspective of economics as a field of study as we know it today, this is pretty logical. But economists work for governments or banks or investment banks. Yes they also teach and such but even leaders in academia are funded by banks or government. No government or bank wants to change to an alien form of currency.
Points 1-3 are trivially refutable.
Point 4 could be valid. There's no one to "fix" economic problems in bitcoin. The government&amp;banks have the power to force things in ways that can arguable help. Like stopping runs on banks, "printing" more money to fund a war, chargebacks for fraud. Obviously these all have negative side effects, some of the the "side effects" seem like the primary effect, and the positives don't seem worth it. Maybe governments have to "fix" things because they were broken to begin with?  For instance, negative impact of runs on banks are intensified by fractional reserve banking. Maybe fractional reserve banking+govt intervention isn't the way to go? That doesn't necessarily mean the bitcoin model will work on a global scale, but it could, I really can't think of any similar precedent for what bitcoin is. It will however, always exist in some niche of the world exactly because noone can "fix" it.
As I've been writing this, I more and more feel it SHOULDN'T be refuted.  He's convincing investors not to invest in bitcoin. What we really need is merchants to accept it and consumers to spend it. People should write about the advantages of bitcoin TODAY, like hassle free, no chargeback billing, not about the effects it may or may not have on the economy in 2+ years, or how it will fare as an investment vehicle. It's obviously more fun to think about the house we're all gonna buy for only 50btc in 10 years time, but those days may never come. It's worth alot more to appreciate and share the large advantages of bitcoins TODAY.
If consumers equally preferred credit cards and bitcoin, every business would prefer payment in bitcoin, even if they automatically exchanged them for another currency after every sale.

No, you probably don't know when its actually "low". Increase your regular cost averaging purchase if you want, but don't buy based on price movement. If you're buying on price movement and winning you're smarter than most(or luckier) and statistically, you probably aren't.

That's a different argument and distracts from the real issue, which is EVEN IF the government were 100% selflessly interested in the well-being of all people, it could still have its golden key backdoor stolen by a malicious agent. 
A truly benevolent power would not want to hold the keys because that makes the whole system vulnerable.

There are likely existing laws for bartering. If you earn income, it will be taxed based on its worth in your government's currency at that time. Later, it any gains it has will be taxed when you realize them(money hits your bank account). Technically this would also happen everything you bought anything with bitcoin, like if you bought lunch everyday with it or something. I'm not quite sure what governments are going to do to fix that problem.
This is my understanding from a us perspective. No idea what the UK would be like.

Legal requirements of setting up such a thing aside, it's nice to know that bitcoin related crimes have some more legitimacy now.

your argument has some merit but you really don't understand argentina. Their currency is pretty fucked and no one trusts the government, not even some police i talked to in my admittedly anecdotal experience. They basically nationalized euros and usd in 2001 and created hyperinflation in their own currency. Argentineans aren't trying to avoid paying some taxes, they're trying to make sure their savings aren't LITERALLY stolen as a lump sum, since this HAS happened before.
@_date: 2013-06-18 12:29:38

I think this is a valid question. And I think the answer is that, what you view as an important tool for liberty, others view as a dependable trustworthy way to move money at almost zero cost as well as protecting themselves vs inflation. The beauty is you can have your revolution, and the capitalists can make their money and neither of you can stop each other. And no one else can stop either of you. How is that for being worth the bother?

People spend money when both sides view the exchange as beneficial. Not to help the economy or because they are sooo in love with the currency. Some examples of why even talking about hoarding is ridiculous: most people live from paycheck to paycheck and aren't hoarding a dime when you consider their debts, google is sitting on 50BILLION dollars in just cash. People who aren't prepared to let things play out however they do probably shouldn't sit around bitcointalk or r/bitcoin complaining about hoarding the completely unregulated, runaway train that is bitcoin. 
Don't let people here get you too worked up man. Just sit on your hoard until you want to spend some and watch the fireworks.

It rarely takes me more than 4 characters to realize i'm on the wrong layout and start typing the other way, 1-2 if I'm actively looking where i'm typing rather than an area/whole screen.

I completely empathize with your sentiment, especially the pragmatism part, but I don't think an influx of users or capital, however rapid, will be bad for bitcoin, though it might be bad for the user if they buy high, sell low and leave jaded, convinced it would be a get rich quick scheme. Even if users do come in high and sell low, that's not something that's unique to bitcoin. If we assume widespread adoption of bitcoin, this kind of personal loss for the user is inevitable for someone, either buying/earning fiat high and selling low for bitcoin, or buying/earning bitcoin high and selling low for fiat. I do assume widespread adoption because I've read the code, I at least marginally understand the technology, and I think it's practically un-killable. As long as it's not completely dead, there's always the chance to go up. 
They say invest in what you understand, and invest for the long haul. That's probably a reason to not try to convince people to invest in bitcoin, it does its own convincing, and if not then i guess they don't understand and therefore shouldn't invest in it. 
tldr; bitcoin will succeed on its technical merits, not its nice community or market stability. community and stability will inevitably form around it because of its technical merits. see! look at me convincing you! dialog! community!...
