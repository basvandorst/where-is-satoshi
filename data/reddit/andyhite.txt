Mt. Gox code that leaked about a week ago.

As the parent of a two year old son, I hope to one day be as awesome as your parents are. They're teaching you a lesson kid - not trying to scam you out of money.

Purchase coins on Coinbase, transfer to Bitstamp for trades, then transfer back to Coinbase when you want to "cash out" to fiat. I think that's how most people do it, myself included.

Less risky than Bitcoin, yeah. Bitcoin is high risk, high reward. Stocks (and especially bonds) are lower risk investments - the odds of you losing your entire investment are way, way lower. There's nothing wrong with being a high risk investment (or putting your money in one), you should just be a little more careful.

Cool, that makes sense. It just sounded (to me) like that $20 was the only money you could spare for any kind of savings.

I guess you're new to Bitcoin, or just incredibly out of the loop. Read a few of the posts here over the past two weeks or so and you'll understand.

If that $20 is all you're contributing to your entire savings / investments (which judging by the way you worded your post, it is), then I'd recommend putting only a small portion of that into Bitcoin. We all want Bitcoin to succeed, but it's a volatile and risky investment...so basically, don't put all your eggs in one basket because if that basket drops, you're shit out of luck (see: the Gox debacle).
If you're putting $80 a month into investments, then put $70 of that into something less risky - like stock and / or bonds - and the remaining $10 into something risky, like Bitcoin. If BTC goes to the moon and your $120 / year investment turns into $1200 overnight, that's awesome...but don't bet your entire savings on it.
That being said, you can set up recurring purchases on Coinbase.

There's a difference between good code that isn't "pretty" and bad code. Most of the comments that I've read regarding the leaked Mt. Gox code were pointing fingers at bad coding practices, like repeated values that should have been stored as constants, as well as a few nit-picks about "ugliness" that fall into the category of your complaint.
I could give a shit less about code being "pretty", but bad code is bad code. If you continually hack stuff into your code in order to "just get it done", you end up with a jumbled, unmaintainable mess that's brittle and error prone. That appears to be the case with the Mt. Gox code.
Pretty or ugly, it doesn't matter - just take your time and do it right.
Edit: I was under the impression this was referring to the Mt. Gox code leak, not comments about Satoshi's code. However, I stand by the point I was making (even if it may not be relevant to the OP).

Considering Apple has banned Bitcoin wallets from the app store, it's doubtful this would be a possibility (at least as far as iOS is concerned).
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:58:54
Yeah, that's the gist of it. Just don't use Coinbase for making all of those trades - it issues an ACH transaction against your bank account for every trade, which is not going to be fun (and your bank will probably not appreciate it). Exchanges that have actual trading platforms have a kind of "brokerage" account that holds your fiat in between trades, then you cash everything out in one big transaction when you want access to it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:11:38
My mistake - I believe myself and a few other people were under the impression that you were referring to the Gox code leak from last week. However, that still doesn't change the point I was trying to make.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:32:14
Because childish insults is a great way to convince people they should give you money.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:37:51
Yeah, I guess I should have said "insert trading platform of your choice".

Today is a federal / bank holiday in many areas of the US, so that could explain the lack of response from their support staff.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:09:52
My mistake. Given the discussions a few days ago about the leaked Mt. Gox code, I assumed this was just a "late to the game" response.

I believe the general sentiment regarding Buffett's comments on Bitcoin is that while yes, he is a brilliant man, he has on multiple occasions said that he purposely avoids investing in tech related companies because he doesn't understand enough about them to properly value them. If he (self admittedly) doesn't understand enough about tech companies like Google or Yahoo, then it's very far-fetched to believe he understands Bitcoin enough to make an informed statement about it.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:02:34
Yeah, that's the way it works. Your money never leaves Bitstamp, it just gets moved a around internally so you can make quick trades.
@_date: 2014-09-15 01:50:38
WTF man. Stop spamming your social media shit. No one cares.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:26:56
This smells like a hoax. There are a handful of things that seem "off" (as noted by other Redditors), but if they were preparing to admit defeat and go under (effectively taking all of Bitcoin with them), they wouldn't have even made any attempts to fix the malleability issue. I recall that a few days ago it was noted by that a response from their API was showing a new TXID, which seems to prove there has been some work done on the malleability issue.
This seems like someone spreading FUD in order to crash the price even further to buy ultra-cheap coins before the *real* news comes out and things (possibly) recover.
It just doesn't add up. I'm going to take the opportunity to snatch up some cheap coins and hold until this whole thing is over, for better or for worse. I haven't invested any more than I'm willing to lose, and I'm in it for the long haul.
