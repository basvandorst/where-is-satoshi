are triangle breakouts scale invariant??  How do you know the proper scale of your graph to be sure its a triangle breakout?  Do they happen on the scale of minutes, hours, days, months??

It seems bitcoin crossed some exposure threshold in this current bubble of being covered on many mainstream media outlets and getting attention from governments and legitimate financial folks.  How do you think all this exposure is going to effect the longevity of the current bubble??

this guy is a scam!

yea, if you weren't you would be offering someone a percentage of your money to recover your bitcoin.  Instead your just bitching constantly that you don't have any hoping someone will just give you some

Good points.  I agree more with the first point and on that note:  
Are you familiar with the term "giant connected component" in network theory?  I think, structurally, a GCC is connecting around the world of people who know about bitcoin and see its potential.  At first it was just an obscure tool known to lucid druggies and hardline libertarian anarchists.  Now the need for a digital, decentralized currency is being realized by a lot of people around the world and bitcoin is taking off.  This will be the first currency accepted anywhere in the world.  Exchange rates are a thing of the past, every good in the world will have a bitcoin price and you will make the purchase with your smartphone. 
I don't know much about how finance works but I think the bitcoin will keep rising in this current bubble and its true market price will be realized.  This price will reflect the fact that bitcoin is the next revolutionary step in currency.  I think this current bubble will be the largest leap in bitcoin price before its starts to normalize around said market price and then will just fluctuate like every other currency does when world events happen.
