This guy and his cronies stole 10 bitcoins from me on his gambling site. He's one of the worst members of the bitcoin community and any/all of his endeavors should be boycotted. Glad his twitter is suspended. 
Details of the theft, as well as obnoxious retorts from MP et al, are in this bitcointalk thread: 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:45:39
You accept BTC as payment because it makes it much easier for a BTC using consumer to transact with you and lowers your transaction fees.
As long as you spell out how you handle bitcoin refunds in your return policy, why would buying and refunding bitcoins (at USD price of product) at the time of return processing be a problem?
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:18:44
Sum Pig food truck takes bitcoin. Yeah, Cavanaugh's is kinda fratty, but I've gone a couple times just to pay in btc. Their wings night isn't bad.
There is another cafe that purports to accept them, but I remember that the guy behind the counter wasn't sure how to check the balance of the wallet whose QR code was displayed... can't remember the name of the place right now. 
I've been pushing Breezy's Cafe to take btc for a while now, without much success. The guy at Iztaccihuatl was into it when I told him about it, but not sure if he followed through.

That's a decent idea - it would be about break even but that would probably be okay. Our margins are [posted]( on the website, if you're curious.
I'm a little wary of posting it on r/bitcoin though because I don't want to annoy people by posting what's essentially an unsolicited ad.

Thanks! Yeah, I'm really excited about it, though I want businesses to be even more radically transparent - sharing manufacturing techniques, partners, etc. Essentially, I'd like every product I buy to come with a lego manual explaining its production...
Right now we're looking at integrating with BareMetrics because they have a project called the [Open Startups Initiative]( that seems really cool and along the lines of what we want to do. A bitcoiner actually got in touch through our "Services Wanted" page recently and is working on updating our product pages so that when you mouse over the price it pops out with the cost of goods sold breakdown.

We already run a 'BITCOIN' promo code that gives 25% off so should probably do better than that. 3 shirts for $40 (like you suggested earlier) might work, though - just have to find a good platform to post the deal.
I agree that there should be a bitcoin spotlight website - is there anything else out there besides bitcoin black friday? Open Bazaar isn't quite ready yet, right?

What I really want is an exhaustive list of the spots on the web to promote a bitcoin business. So far I've posted mine on the bitcoin wiki, reddit, bitcoin black friday, coinmap, and various facebook groups (though those aren't the best place to post). I did a $1BTC per share promo on facebook which put me in contact with a few people offering social media advertisement (a popular brazilian bitcoin website, twitter accounts with large followings, facebook pages, etc.). I'm talking to coinforest as well.
What else is out there?

To my detriment, I've held all coins from Pirate Printing Company's sales so far - most of which happened on Bitcoin Black Friday when the price was &gt;$1000. It shouldn't be a big deal in the long run, but the volatility is (obviously) a problem when you have material costs.

I don't have any problem with this post - just want some clarification. I posted a few links (admittedly with poor header wording) to my t-shirt company over the weekend, but was voted down severely each time. 
I read the no advertisement clause in the sidebar this morning and ponied up for some reddit ad space (tho there are no impressions available on this subreddit!).
Did I just not understand that my "girlfriend" (in quotes cuz that could be faked, though I don't doubt the OP) had to post my business for it to be okay? WTF, reddit?
