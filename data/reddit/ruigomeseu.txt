The client seed will be editable in a future iteration. However you are still able to verify and validate your spins.
If you have some time to spare, I'd love to discuss provably fair improvements, hit me up at hello

If you have enough balance to withdraw (&gt; 1 satoshis), there should be a withdraw button next to the balance.
Just enter a Ligthning Payment Request for the amount you want to withdraw and you get paid instantly.

I believe there isn't any Lightning Mainnet iOS wallet so far, so your best option would be to have a desktop wallet such as Zap:

Beautiful, thanks for playing, hope you enjoyed the experience ⚡️

The lightning payment request preimage would definitely be a good idea. However there is the possibility that you play with the balance you already have, in which case there is no payment request.
Regarding the client seed, that makes sense. Will add an editable client seed first thing in the morning, currently just past 3AM here in Portugal. Thank you for the advice, it is much appreciated

Yo, fair criticism here.
I'm the guy behind Lightning Spin and you definitely can't find much about this project online.
I've just launched it today on Lightning Mainnet so other Lightning Network enthusiasts can have some fun and win some sats.
Lightning Spin is provably fair and it also offers you instant settlement of your bets, meaning you can take away your earnings instantly using Lightning :)
Hope this clarifies some of your concerns!

Lightning Spin is meant to be played with a wallet that supports both sending and receiving payments.
In case you can't receive payments through the Lightning Network, I can manually send you an on-chain transaction. The fee is paid for by the receiving party.
Hit me up at hello with your Current Seed Pair, which you can find on the Provably Fair modal and your BTC address.

I believe OpenNode should be the easiest way to start accepting bitcoin at a restaurant/bar. Just sign up for an account and use the Quick Invoice feature on any tablet or smartphone and you're good to go.

They're using % of volume using SegWit.
The website you refered shows % of transactions using SegWit.
Their source seems to be  which actually shows both those metrics.

There’s Eclair and Bitcoin Lightning Wallet on Android.
There’s Zap on desktop.
There’s the Casa Node.
Or just follow Pierre Rochard’s guide on how to set it up on any computer:

One of the most important developments of the last few years, being built right now in the midst of the bear market!

Different websites show their own view of the network, it’s not uncommon to see this kind of discrepancy.
