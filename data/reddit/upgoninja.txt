You're wrong there's no downside. For all we know, BFX will watch the market *and then* decide which rules to pit in place. They have already forcibly converted people's money into tokens, now they are going to watch us trade them and publish info that will move their value after the fact. There's no way for the average person to win. At best, we can guess and get lucky while friends of BFX don't have to guess.

The director claimed to run from from Miami to the BitPay office in San Francisco. That's over 3,000 miles and yet he was noticeably overweight on arrival.
3,200 miles in 150 days is &gt; than 20 miles EVERY DAY for 5 months, not to mention that some days would be uphill the entire marathon.
Assuming he rested 1-2 days per week - something that professional runners would need to do - then he ran back-to-back full marathons, no matter the weather, no matter injuries, no matter sunburns and heat exhaustion, no matter topography and road or trail conditions, multiple times per week for several months. Needless to say, he didn't do it.

Actually, [absence of evidence is always evidence of absence](
"Under the vast majority of real-life circumstances, a cause may not reliably produce signs of itself, but the absence of the cause is even less likely to produce the signs. The absence of an observation may be strong evidence of absence or very weak evidence of absence, depending on how likely the cause is to produce the observation.  The absence of an observation that is only weakly permitted (even if the alternative hypothesis does not allow it at all), is very weak evidence of absence (though it is evidence nonetheless)."

Minor typo:


The "fee marketplace" argument for 1MB blocks is out of touch with today's reality, but improvements in wallet software would make a marketplace work pretty painlessly. Still I would want the block rate to be dropped down to Litecoin levels. This way you could wait 1-5 minutes for the first block and add *child-pay-parent* or whatever to bump the priority if it wasn't included as you expected. Waiting 5-30 minutes for a block is unnecessarily slow.

Welcome toThere is a fairly strong shared belief around here that bitcoins are undervalued relative to the fundamentals of usefulness and scarcity of the coins. Sometimes that's taken as a premise because we don't want to explain our reasons in detail in the middle of every single conversation.
Anyway, having bitcoins readily available to the world's largest liquidity pools will let joe investor speculate without understanding private keys, cold storage, or even basic computer security. Speculators provide a service to the market which can be decoupled from actually understanding this technology. We think that a small percentage of this untapped group of investors/speculators will grab coins once it is on par as easy as everything else they speculate on. It's not a 1% fallacy to believe this if there are independent reasons to think that making Bitcoin easier and more familiar to these people will change their behavior.

Rebroadcasting a similar transaction with a fee attached will invalidate the one that's waiting. Basically you initiate a double-spend and the new one (with a fee) will get confirmed. Once it's confirmed, the old transaction will be invalid and forgotten.
Your client probably does not allow double-spend attempts, but it's possible via blockchain.info. Warning: Don't create a raw transaction unless you really know what you are doing!
People are working on making fee changes easier for us mere mortals; one example is ConfirmNext. I have no idea if this service is reliable or secure, but it might be worth exploring.

Heretic here. I think the transaction should be invalid unless there is a flag included that essentially says, "Yes, I want to include an unusually high miner's fee."
Specific implementation details - where does the flag belong? what is the definition of 'unusually high'? - can be left to the experts, but the functional requirement is to make it much harder to accidentally tip a miner your life savings just because you used buggy software or thought you were super smart enough to make a raw transaction.

Notice that I did not say high fees should be invalid, rather high fees should include a hard to mistakenly include confirmation flag. I agree that there will be users who want to include very high fees; maybe OP found just such a case.
Remember too that part of the motivation for validation functions is to protect users from buggy software and even from their own mistakes. Since transactions are irreversible and may contain suicide levels of money if lost, the utility of these validations are high.
@_date: 2016-03-03 05:30:09
Why? Would it require too many CPU cycles for fully validating nodes?
Application designers prefer to write validation functions in once place rather than 70 separate client applications. The rule 'confirmation is required to pay miners more than half your transaction if &gt;1 BTC' has a lot of utility, don't you think?

Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Summers became a professor of economics at Harvard University in 1983. He left Harvard in 1991, working as the Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act."

Coinbase follows U.S. money transmitter regulations, they use cryptocurrency best practices such as "cold storage", and they've been around for awhile. If you use their Vault, then the coins are further protected by various timelock schemes, and the Multisig Vault gives you even greater control, see 
So to answer your question: No, Coinbase does not have a history of losing people's money and they are *probably* not going to lose yours. But with Bitcoin, you have so many options; you can be your own bank. Would you rather have 100% control of your coins? Are you prepared to secure them against hackers and simple mistakes? Be your own bank is an awesome property of Bitcoin, but a fairly large percentage of us have lost coins due to carelessness or a sophisticated hack.
*edit:* The most important thing you can do right now is add Two Factor Authentication to your email account. There are many ways a hacker can steal your online accessible Bitcoins if only they hack into your email. Two factor auth makes unauthorized access a thousand times harder. Do it. A lot of bitcoiners learned this the hard way.

[CoPay]( Install it on your phone and again on your PC, then create a 2 of 2 multisignature wallet between them. Now a theif would need access to both devices (or their seeds) to move your coins.
Write down your seeds, send a small fraction of a coin to the wallet and then delete the software from your phone and your PC. Now use the seeds to get your money back! This proves to you that the system works and that you can recover from dropping your phone into a lake or whatever. It takes a little extra time to test the backup, but there's nobody to call if you screw it up.

Well, there's that, huh?
OP, this guy is referring to some network scalability issues we've been debating. As of now, the Bitcoin network won't process thousands of transactions per second like Visa, or even hundreds of tps like PayPal. If it could, we are afraid that some bozo would spam and overload the network, but exactly how to set this limitation is hotly debated. The good news is that these decisions are made out in the open for all. The bad news is that Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second at this moment - a number that is laughably low for global economy.

Unless something has changed in the last couple of months, Circle will not accept a Visa gift card.
OP, this will take a few days and the exchange rate will not be in your favor, but the only way I know to spend a gift card for bitcoins is to use purse.io - you will buy something on an Amazon public wish list using that gift card and use the purse website to act as a 3rd party to broker the deal. If all goes well, you'll get bitcoins in 4-5 days at about $30.00 per coin higher than the exchanges. Yeah, that sucks, but I don't think you'll find any other business willing to give you bitcoins for a Visa Gift Card.

The post (and the linked webpage) asks for bitcoins to be sent to 32hpM5uCFHFEkV1UuXWfwFef2u7GNKa4Yj. Wrapping that sentence with a PGP signature will stop a hacker from editing the text without us knowing.
Granted, most people sending a few millibits won't bother to PGP verify the message, but for anyone sending a lot of money, it's a good idea to check.
It's just weird to me that Bitcoin companies don't regularly use digital signatures. It's as if they are announcing to the community, "Hi, We are too busy or ignorant for this level of security, please let us have your digital currency anyway!"

It's kind of like personal computing. The IBM PS1 didn't solve enough problems for many families, but PC's kept getting better.
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, aka OP_HODL was just released for testing, and it's a good example for Bitcoin: "How can I force my future self to save money?" Or even, "How can I give money to my kids without giving them the power to spend it now?"
For large amounts, you might setup a trust or something, but that's not cheap and most of us never do it. For smaller amounts, you can go to Walmart and put stuff on "layaway" (assuming that the money is set aside to buy stuff at Walmart).
But OP_HODL solves the problem beautifully. I envision a Wallet with budgeting module built right in. Do you have a bill due next month for 50k bits? Just click the lock icon and enter how many days to lock them. Small or large amounts can be lock saved without asking any 3rd party for help. That's the kind of thing crypoocurrencies make possible and I think we've only begun to explore this space.

"Bitcoin’s value as money needs to be understood like gold, which comes not from legal force, but from its specific attributes. Bitcoin’s attributes make it an amazing form of money and it was engineered for just that purpose. It is easy to divide and recombine It cannot be counterfeited It is highly durable, so long as certain precautions are taken It can be sent anywhere, instantly, at near-zero cost If you were going to make a super hero currency, this is one of the traits you would give it Can’t do that with gold due to physical constraints, or dollars due to legal constraints It is scarce, with a known supply and a known inflation schedule And it cannot be manipulated, restricted, or seized by any central party (shares this property with gold). Nobody has special privileges. In this way, it is very democratic, and very egalitarian.
Just as mankind has engineered houses to be used as shelter and cars to be used as transportation, so too can we engineer something to be used as an ideal medium of exchange. But while the dollar is a poorly engineered money (so poor in fact that it relies on coercion for its value), Bitcoin is a brilliantly engineered money.
It might not be perfect, but it’s pretty damn good, and this is why people are using it as money, despite the fact that nobody is forced to.
And given that it is so useful as money, due to its attributes, it should not be a surprise to anyone that it commands a market price. Any good that is useful and scarce will have a price on the market.
Economists and journalists get very caught up around the question, **why does Bitcoin have value? The answer is easy: because it’s useful and scarce.**" - Erik Voorhees, u/evoorhees

Because you want to incentivize certain development tasks, or schedule, or process that's unlikely to happen without paying people.

This kind of market is a sweet spot for Bitcoin: Users are above average technical + other forms of payment take a huge cut of the revenue.
IconFinder will make more money even if they give bitcoiners a discount. And don't forget the value of having zero chargebacks: guaranteed money within minutes.

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." The design didn't specify who those peers are intended to be.
Your questions about scaling Bitcoin are answered and debated all over this sub, dev mailing lists, blogs, the bitcoin.org wiki and elsewhere. Additionally, they are vague.

I think part of the problem is that Gavin has not yet said, "Oops" with an explanation of what happened.
Good engineers know how to admit mistakes and then work through a post mortem to prevent that kind of thing from happening again. If Gavin does this, I think a great deal of trust will be restored. He will never satisfy all the critics, but I think he can satisfy many.

You described the problem well: bitcoin/bitcoin carries weight. This is a problem because its existence necessitates a management team or benelovant dictator for that shared fork. Then people tweet "X does not deserve commit access" and unnecessary arguments ensue.
Git does not require forks to be hosted at a central project URL. Confused people who apparently don't understand distributed source control require the central host. Since Greg, Luke, and the rest of the team do understand Git and the pull request workflow, I would expect them to be willing to shut down /bitcoin/bitcoin as a central and official end point in favor of GitHub user repos like /laanwj/bitcoin.

I have a pretty decent grasp of the English language, yet I have no idea what this *means*.
