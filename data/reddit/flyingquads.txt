Correct help for OP should be:
- Never spend what you cannot lose
- Not your keys, not your coins. (meaning: put the coins in your own wallet, don't leave them on an exchange.)
- Buy low, sell high.
- hodl (meaning: don't sell if you don't have to.)
- Inform yourself. Don't rely on others for tips when to buy/sell, do your own research. If unsure: just hodl.

Kraken is also a very responsible market. (But your data is held indefinitely by the U.S. intelligence agencies. Just so you know.) I have been using Kraken for a year and have also experienced a very nice customer service for specific Dutch problems (the ABN bank blocked one of my transactions because they dislike BTC). Kraken was very helpful.

He asked for a 'cheap way'. Bitonic is fine, but not cheap.

I've given all customers (about a 1000 per year for context) the upfront option what payment options I accept. I've also had 1 year (as a try out) where I offered a 10% discount when using Bitcoin. With or without the discount (which is why I stopped the discount) I've had about a handful (or maybe 10) a year of customers paying with Bitcoin. Only once or twice have I actually had customers using Bitcoin because they wouldn't want to use any other payment option (so essentially customers I would have missed out on if I wouldn't accept BTC).
This very low number of customers using BTC has also lead to me not automating the process yet and all transactions so far have simply been through me manually providing address, verifying the transaction, etc. (and refunds when a customer returned a product and paid through BTC).
For context, I sell computers and computer parts online, I ship to every nook and cranny of my country and my customer base is quite tech savvy, generally.
I will continue to provide the BTC option and hope it will pick up in the future, but so far it has been quite an unpopular method for me.

I have used ndorier's libraries a bunch of times. They work really well and are very easy to get into if you have a small bit of knowledge of c I just thought it was a shame the blockchain parser was focusing on azure deployment, I'd much rather use it on my home PC and experiment, than to host it in a cloud environment. Other than that, the documentation is generally great and most common stuff can be found (stackoverflow FTW).

To be honest, something like dogecoin would be better for microtransactions. No one is going to do 1 satoshi transactions using bitcoin. But when using dogecoin, it would only cost 1 doge (1/50th satoshi per transaction). Trading back to BTC is always possible. Additional advantage is the user experience, dogecoin is much faster and works in 1000's for meaningless amounts of money, whereas btc uses 0.00000001 for it. Technically implementing a different cryptocoin is not more or less difficult than btc.

Don't forget Bitcoin is also tied to a Dragonball Z meme. Whenever it is just under 9K we buy just enough so it is over 9K and we can all post memes again.

Not to mention that banks kept the money the Jewish people left behind after the second world war.
Same thing during the Jugoslav war, the Slovenian Bank kept the money and people trying to get their money back after the war were just told it's all gone now.

Just so I get it right. The people behind these 400M worth of longs that are liquidated, just lost a ton of money?
