So hang on a minute....is lighting network live on the main net? Haven’t visited this sub in a while and can see posts about it. Also transaction backlog seems to be down. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:32:28
Not sure if I’m being stupid, but if they can’t actually buy the coin, and can only predict if it’s going to go up or down, won’t it not do anything to the price? Because they’re not actually buying or selling

They blocked scaling solutions for years because it made their mining equipment less efficient. They then told everyone ‘bitcoin is shit because it can’t scale, we are forking the coin, removing segwit and increasing block sizes so that we can align with satoshi’s true vision’
Whereas in reality; 1) they blocked scaling for years, if it wasn’t for them we’d be a lot further ahead right now. 2) increasing block sizes means less miners on the network since it uses more bandwidth etc. (Which is good for them, as them they can mine more). 3) they only don’t like segwit because it stops their ASIC advantage. 
Whole point of the currency is that it’s decentralised, bigger blocks removes this and puts more power to the mining companies. 
They also dont say it’s bitcoin cash and just call it bitcoin. People who are new will go to bitcoin.com, create a wallet thinking they are creating a bitcoin wallet, then send their bitcoin there, losing their funds. That’s really despicable imo. 
Edit: also I’ve never used bch, but I’ve heard it’s slow.

Of course it’s malicious. They’re grabbing money. 
I read today that the difficulty adjustment implemented on Monday will create 2,000 more bcash than bitcoin each week. Meaning that miners profit more. 
Can no one supporting it see this?

I knew gold had a bounty up to implement it, still makes them look pretty incompetent. 
So s2x is a blatant attack? Why are any exchanges listing it? Just because they signed the nya? (Which was already broken when bch was forked)
The whole thing is retarded and will be a massive turn off for the masses when it goes tits up. It's a real shame that a few peoples greed is going to fuck it up for many.

Just saw a post on r/btc where they are celebrating that bitcoin.com is ranked higher than bitcoin.org. 
Just shows how retarded their followers are, they’re happy that new people will go to their website and be scammed into buying bitcoin cash, they’ll then deposit to a btc wallet and lose their funds, as they won’t understand the difference. 
That and their only argument for bigger block sizes is ‘BUT ITS SATOSHIS VISION’
Shut the fuck up already. You’re all a bunch of fucking sheep that are being manipulated. If you can’t see that you’re a fucking idiot who can’t think for yourself.
I would post this there but I don’t want to lose all my comment karma. Also I’m quitting smoking so I might be a bit grouchy, but yeah, my point stands.

Putting aside what any of the other guys have done, I don’t understand how the others can show fake satoshi any sign of respect. 
He literally went on national television and lied, claiming to be satoshi. You’d have to actually be messed up in the head to be able to lie like that on live TV. The pressure would be insane. 
Does it ever come up at their meetings? Do they refer to him as satoshi? Do any of them ask him questions about early days? Do they actually believe him?
It just doesn’t make sense to me 
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:16:18
Sorry bro, but that's another thing that annoys me. When people compare it to the dot com bubble. 
It's different, the dot com bubble was due to people buying shares, hoping they would go up, you couldn't do anything with these shares other than buy/sell them. 
Bitcoin is a whole different ball game because it has real life use cases, you can send money within the hour to someone on the other side of the world without using a middleman and for a fraction of the price that you'd pay using western union etc. 
That alone is game-changing. Someone sent $160 million dollars in August for around $2. Can you imagine doing that with current methods, I.e. Your bank, PayPal or WU?
The difference in bitcoin is that it's got real world uses, that makes it different than stocks or shares. (Yes, a lot of altcoins are similar to shares as they have speculative value and no working product, however this topic is about Bitcoin)

Yes it does, why doesn't it?
Originally there was just bitcoin, just because others have copied it, is that bitcoins fault?
People make fraudulent paper money, does that (noticeably) devalue paper money?
Does fools gold (or any other metal, based on your argument) devalue real gold?
No.

Pretty much, the worst thing about it is, it's pretty objective. Like it's hard to argue with some of the points, yet people still believe. 
You could probably list 100's of things wrong/scams that have happened etc etc with the central banking system, then list reasons as to why it can't happen with bitcoin, yet people still shake their heads. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:57:35
Nice picture. 
Only thing I’d say is it starts off for beginners then when you get to ‘what does bitcoin do’, a beginner would be left with more questions than answers. (‘What is a decentralised currency’, ‘how is it without banks?’, ‘peer to peer currency’)
I’d just show what you did about fiat in reverse, then people will think, ‘hang on, my buying power increases over time with this ‘bitcoin’? Instead of decreasing like the first pictures. 
Nice and easy on the eyes though. Great job

We are adults and we are having a conversation. Nobody is telling anyone what to do. 
I’m trying to convey my point that telling people who are new to the space they should just hodl is detrimental. 
We, as adults, can have a debate without resorting to ‘DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO’. I’d suggest you grow up a bit tbh. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:50:37

Thanks both for clarifying.

Additionally, there’s little difficulty and less risk than fiat unless you’re stupid. 
Fucking hell. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:45:08
Oh yeah I forgot about that, miners are blatantly propping up bch, so all of that hashpower moving over to b2x will (likely) finally cause the death of bitcoin cash. 
Doesn't this also mean that the original chain is going to be extremely slow/bad for a while?
(I don't know much about mining - does the difficulty adjust on the original bitcoin chain? So that would counteract all of the hashpower leaving to b2x?)
If this is the case, why is all of the money expected to come back into alts after the 25th (date you have to have btc to get bcg in Nov), won't even more money be pouring into btc so that people can also get b2x? (Whenever that's meant to come out - I read November?)
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:09:40
I’m not saying people need bitcoin to live their lives.
I’m saying there are clear benefits of using bitcoin over fiat, but you don’t seem to know what they are. You’re just here to make a quick buck which is a worrying trend in crypto currencies. Why do you think it went up to begin with? Because of the tech and benefits of using it over fiat. 
Anyway I’m not continuing to argue with someone who doesn’t understand the fundamentals of crypto currencies. Please DYOR before investing.

You do realise hodling is bad for adoption. 
All this ‘hodl’ bs needs to stop. 
Buying bitcoin and forgetting about it for two years isn’t good for anything other than making/losing money. Which it’s not meant to be about. 
Spend bitcoin so more people use/accept/see it as legitimate. Then the price will increase naturally. 
There’s nothing wrong with hodling, but all of this shit that gets spouted over reddit about how everyone should hodl ain’t right. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 14:04:17

If you look at it like that it’s a chicken and egg situation. Also it’s currently failing to have any use other than speculative value. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:17:28
Again, I don't think you understand bitcoin. 
Yes bitcoin could soft fork to create more 'bitcoins', however nobody would buy/mine it, as it defeats the point of having a fixed supply. 
To get it on the main bitcoin protocol there would need to be a consensus (I'm not 100% sure how many) of people agreeing to the change. Which would never happen, beauty of decentralisation my friend. 
Bitcoin cash isn't bitcoin, it's a fork, bitcoin has been forked 1000's of times since inception. However 99.9% have ceased to exist because nobody mines or uses them. 
Also I haven't looked into it, but the majority of the computing power for bitcoin cash is held by one organisation I hear. It's not bitcoin, nobody who knows anything about crypto thinks bitcoin cash is bitcoin, this topic is about bitcoin, not bitcoin cash. 
Edit: yes, downvote me instead of replying with a reasonable argument 
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:32:47
See, this is exactly what I mean. Hodl (and subsequently hoping to make money) is all new people buy it for. 
You don’t even know the benefits of using bitcoin over fiat. You only think it’s a vehicle to make money. 
This comment solidifies what I’m saying here. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:44:13
There are 1000 bitcoins. 1000 different people own 1 bitcoin each.
990 of these people hodl their bitcoin and it never sees the light of day.
10 people spend their bitcoin. A few no coiners see these 10 people spending bitcoin in shops or whereever, see that a shop accepts bitcoin and think, 'hmm that looks good, I want in'.
Adoption gradually increases and the price may slowly go up. 
Example 2.
There are 1000 bitcoins, 1000 people own 1 bitcoin each.
990 people spend their bitcoin.
lots more people are spending bitcoin, shops suddenly start thinking 'hey hang on, these people are spending bitcoin, we don't accept bitcoin. Let's start accepting bitcoin so that we can ensure that they're always able to spend with us', no coiners now go into many more shops and see that lots of places are now accepting this 'bitcoin' and they think 'I want in'.
Adoption increases quicker and the price may go up quicker, as now many more people want a piece of the pie.
Look, I'm not telling anyone how to spend their money, I'm just saying can we stop spouting that HODL is the best strategy, it's not, and telling newcomers this is detrimental to the space and to your wallet. 
Also from a profit perspective if you had purchased many of the top 100 coins 12 months ago you would have been better off at selling at pretty much any point during the last 12 months than by hodling till today.
Hodl is a meme.

@_date: 2018-07-02 10:04:37
I’m saying you should do both. Obviously if you have money you don’t go out and blow it all in one load, you have some in a bank and then spend what you need on things that you need. 
What I’m saying the problem is, is that there’s this thought process on reddit that you should buy a coin, lock it up for a few years and never see it. Which again, it’s your money do what you want. But we gotta realise that’s not the best strategy, nor the best thing to be telling newcomers. 
I kinda see it like; everyone’s to scared to miss a pump so nobody wants to spend their bitcoin (which I understand). However everyone’s shooting themselves in the foot by doing this (from an adoption standpoint; which would lead to a price increase).
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:08:26

@_date: 2017-07-19 19:14:07

@_date: 2017-07-20 11:19:30
Perfect - that's exactly what I was looking for, thanks. 
So what's the deal with august 1st, if BIP 91 isn't activated before August 1st then 148 will automatically activate on august 1st?

@_date: 2019-05-21 06:39:13
I’ve been in the crypto scene for 2 years. 
My point is, the poor dude has lost a shit load of money. I’m sure now he knows ‘not your keys, not your crypto’. 
But having someone commenting on the post rubbing it is is just annoying for the dude. Every single time someone loses money on an exchange someone comments ‘not your keys, not your crypto’. 
Yes, I agree, you should hold your coins in cold storage. But having someone writing snide comments when the guys obviously gutted doesn’t help.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:04:25
Thanks, so basically, both BIP 91 and BIP 148 are a way of activating BIP 141 (which is segwit) and they are both soft forks?
If BIP 91 can activate segwit, but it'll be activated on august 1st by BIP 148 anyway, what's the point in signalling to activate before August, as it's just going to happen on the 1st anyway?
EDIT: just reread your post and I think I understand it better, so, BIP 91 and 148 is a way of activating segwit (141) before August 1st, which will mean that there's no chain split. However 141 is due to activate on august 1st anyway, and if it activates without enough people signalling for 148 or 91 then it will cause a chain split?
