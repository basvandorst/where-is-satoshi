They really should have put Dogecoin second on the list.
They would get lots of actual orders of this device if it was able to make Dogecoin Wallets...not so sure about Peercoin.

Seems like a good idea.

Would have been nice is if focused in on one of these cracks in the system and explained it in detail and why/how it is being exploited and by whom and why people in charge do not dare to fix it.
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:13:51
Ah that makes a tiny bit more sense.
But overall no matter what 20k + 250 a month + upkeep repair costs + time spent filling it etc =  a massive loss.

Bitcoins can sponsor a field of runners for the NYC Marathon (each charitable spot costs $2500).
So a field of 10 runners would do three great things.
1) 10 distinct and worthy charities would get funded.
2) 10 runners that might not otherwise get to run in the marathon get to run and would spread the word that they were funded by bitcoins.
3) With 10 runners bitcoins would get some very positive press.

1 day old Dogecoin guy here.
After following bitcoins for a year+
All I can say is I have had a lot more fun with dogecoin and for some reason was able to purchase some effortlessly, tip with them, receive tips and play poker (and won a bunch more) all in 1 day.
Bitcoins nodda :(
Not sure why but the fun carefree attitude just makes it all less worrisome is all.

Reddit is weird sometimes.
@_date: 2014-10-15 09:39:00
Ah cool but wow $25k could be spent another way to support bitcoin and have fun.
Heck buying $20k coins and then throwing a crazy $5k Bitcoin party would probably do more for it.

Hi BashCo
You are making /bitcoin a better place for sure.

People being jailed over bits and bytes of virtual 'money'.
Pretty sad and very corrupt.

The benefits are that people value it (but why do they value them).
Going to go a bit off track here to hopefully help and not use tech terms.
Imagine that 1000 seashells exist and  they are extra beautiful.
Now imagine that these 1000 seashells are unique and impossible to duplicate.
Now imagine instead of them being in the real world they are digital and -easy- to send to someone safely.
Next imagine that anyone at any time can look at see that all 1000 seashells exist and are still in perfect shape.
What humans do is see someone unique and nice looking 'thing' that is scarce and easy and cheap to move all over the world.
People decide they want one (or more than one) because that is what humans do when things are unique (we don't run to the beach and grab sand because sand is everywhere).
So now people start to compete to own these things and the value rises.
TL:DR Bitcoins are really cool seashells with a lot of great properties.

I do agree this is a horrible scam but here is the bigger issue I have and its with your business plan and the simple math behind it.
You are down $20,000 from day one and counting...could make 5% of that as an investment instead but ok.
Next you sign a $250 a month lease instead of finding a busy location and 'selling' the owner on it helping their business somehow. Even so $250 a month is HUGE and at best it should have been something like a % of profits maybe.
Lets say you make $2 a transaction...
You need 4-5 a day to pay off the rent on the location.
Then over the next 3 years you need to make back your 20k so 6k a year (no counting the machine breaking and paying to fix it nor counting the expense of trips to fund the machine etc).
So you need another 10-12 uses a day.
Nearly 20 people need to come use that machine every single day just to break even in 3 years.
20 people a day for 1000 days in a row.
My gut says even if you got a machine on day one you would still be DEEP in the hole.
And this is just me guessing with zero knowledge of your per transaction profits.

The 3rd semi-colon after preventdefault is not needed?
Doesn't hurt anything but at first glance it looks out of place (I could be wrong).

Use a new wallet address.
Then only the coins in that address are linked to you.
Anyone could have sent coins to the address for any reason and there is no way to prove the prior address is linked to you.
Privacy is not anonymity.

Thank you for writing a great article, I hope it does not fall on deaf ears.
As for the Winklevoss brothers I highly suspect they were/are deeply involved with the writing of this new set of regulations and it seems obvious they are trying to carve out a space for themselves with a large paywall around it.
Shameful and if true they deserved to lose Facebook.
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:57:37
Why not just check the address on the blockchain and email the public address to yourself.
No need to fire up a wallet.
A website could even be made to email you a daily update on any address you make if you wanted.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:11:05
That is quite a chunk good luck.

The bad thing is any company doing business out in the open in the US could be faced with harsh punishment and would simply close shop instead of risking the wrath of our government.
You boycotting a business would simply play into the governments hands even more so because the only 'business' left would be shady back alley non sense.

The basic idea is their is an approved list of charities...well let me back up.
The marathon is full already and the only way to run it now is to be sponsored by a charity (each cost $2500 I think).
So people that want to run, sign up and pick a charity then they try to raise the money...which reminds me I need to get in touch with a friend to donate to her efforts to run this year.
The race is November 2nd.
@_date: 2014-05-04 23:53:09
Thanks will look into this right now.

The bandwidth is tiny once the ledger is downloaded unless you go with a lite wallet or use a trusted third party wallet (than no bandwidth issue at all).
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:29:25
The US is/was not the best place for Bitcoin to have been 'born' but that is water under the bridge.
World wide adoption will unleash the true power of the public ledger.

Those execs have a ton of dirt on people in power and have given them a shit ton of money to make sure they never pay the price.
The execs and politicians are in collusion and both should go to jail.

Im still new but something that could hold back bitcoin is the high transaction fees compared to other alt coins?
If bitcoin goes to 10 grand a bitcoin what would that do to the min xfer fee?
Im new so I could be way off base but would like to know.
Thanks :)

It is disgusting that you even have to tell anyone why you are buying anything that is not explicitly illegal (like crack or some hard drug).

So a somewhat secretive group could not set up 40-50 mining farms (consisting of 100s of mining machines) over the course of a couple years and gradually build up enough of a hashrate to have voting power? Or better yet, some bank could not come along and payoff the directors of some of the major pools to do what the bank wants?
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:15:10
Calling it an alt-coin is playing dirty.

Thank you for the info.
Would be a neat problem to solve though (that being the need to fully verify the complete history of every single bit and detail for everything for ever vs an agreed upon somewhat recent snapshot of the current lay of the land for each bit in existence, basically like an artificial new starting point which the majority of minors all agree upon which is built into the protocol).
Ah well
@_date: 2015-07-30 05:26:31
I wonder why a snapshot can't be taken of the current blockchain. Then have it verified as accurate and 100% valid, then start a clean empty blockchain that also has a pointer back to the snapshot and the frontend can offer an option to use the snapshot or not (for final full verification).
Lugging around every single tiny fraction of bitcoin exchanged for eternity just seems wasteful when it comes to bandwidth and storage.
Something along the line of an annual snapshot.
I imagine there must be a dozen reasons why this is a bad idea but if something like this could be pulled off, it would address a ton of problems/concerns at once.

X.com was partnered with Confinity (sp) who also had the paypal.com  name and yes they did the Palm Pilot beam thing with an email.
When the companies combined they stuck with x.com for the 1st year then swapped to the paypal.com name and also ditched the beaming and skipped right to the email part.
They were not really competitors (x.com was mostly/mainly in only financial services like giving you the ability to pay bills and consolidate stuff).

And watching how this whole debate was handled was not healthy at all...the mods labeling the fork an alt coin was a slap in the face to the devs that work hard for free.
