Me too. I've tried several different versions of the sound by increasing and decreasing the pitch, but instead of 'yanny' I hear 'yayley'.

The linked website does not match the thread title. There is no mention of activating anything "on demand" or "Windows update", and only one instance of "backdoors", used in an unrelated paragraph.

Judging from the icons and UI, I'd say it's this little obscure program called Google Chrome. But seriously, not everything is an app, damn it!

It is an exchange that only trades between cryptocurrencies, e.g. BTC for ETH or vice versa. To buy Bitcoin from Poloniex, you first need some other cryptocurrency.  
  
If possible, check the fees and rates for Litecoin and Ethereum in your country. They may be cheaper than Bitcoin (i.e, buying $100 worth of LTC and selling it for BTC may provide more BTC than directly buying BTC with the $100).

Just for future reference, Poloniex does not trade Bitcoin for USD or any other fiat currencies, so it was no wonder you couldn't buy from there.

Bitcoin still has non-zero mass. The entire Internet weighs about 50g:   
  
For Bitcoin to weigh 1kg, its blockchain's file size would need to be about 20 times larger than the entire Internet.

Well, if you start to bring magic into the argument, then of course anything's possible.

What is the mark-up on ATM Bitcoins? I wouldn't be surprised if it was much cheaper to buy from exchanges.

I just said in the previous post that Bitstamp has "0 crypto withdrawal fees". *They* pay your fees, so you receive exactly what you buy. This applies for all the other currencies they trade in as well, like Litecoin, Eth and Ripple.

Depends on where he buys it from. For example, Bitstamp exchange has 0 crypto withdrawal fees, as well as 0 fiat deposit fees for EU residents. Of course, this doesn't apply if you're from outside the EU.

Bitstamp has *free* withdrawals: 
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:00:37
Yes, but I forgot to mention that Bitstamp is based in Luxembourg and is an EU company. Withdrawing to a US bank would count as an international transfer, so there's a 0.09% fee, with a minimum of $15.

The exchange rate is given in the Price / BTC column. You don't use any rates when withdrawing Bitcoins. There is only a flat network transaction fee per transaction.  
  
The rate refreshes about every 5 minutes:
