people who are selling off BCC are those who had left their coins in the exchange overnight and were credited an equal amount of BCH to match their BTC. 
Right now it is not possible to send or withdraw coins to/from the exchange, but if you have been credited for keeping BTC there you will be able to sell them for more bitcoin which can be withdrawn later.

There is a massive lack of evidence here... and your arguments on your "Part A1" are ridiculous. I guess you didn't read CMC's FAQ where they clearly state
Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.
APPROXIMATION being the key word.... 
The fact you point out the ETH supply being off by 100 at the time is about where I stopped. If you pay attention long enough it becomes pretty obvious that CMC is pulling their supply numbers directly from etherscan on some interval that is just not always going to be in sync. In fact, I'd be willing to bet most of their supply numbers come from block explorers that anyone with technical knowledge knows you can't just instantly update throughout the day.... leaving those communities running those coins responsible for the manipulation, not CMC...
This entire article and the follow up are pure speculation and provide no real proof of anything you stated.

You are full of shit and I was done with you weeks ago.... You literally sound like a mad kid willing to attack whatever you can because you didn't get your way..... Your facts are awful and your article stinks of an idiot who failed college... goodbye.
