You are right, but what are the chances to get 10 "no" straight if the system is honest. I had max 5 "no" and still won.

Nice, but with the martingale strategy I can take bitcoins out of this system.

Please explain. How could it be verified?

My bad, look now. It takes only few seconds.

auch :D We just had that much winners that server run out of btc-s. I can see your balance in the log. Just clear your cookies and give me a new address, i'll send your balance to that address.

So.. that would prove that I have the btc that is played with? Or is there another reason to do that? Thanks for your responses once again!

The delay should be in the server side. Thanks for the feedback!
