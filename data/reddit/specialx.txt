Lmao nice fucking orders when BTC is declining. May as well just wait for it to do a huge dip to 1k and then pump your entire amount into it. Your buying technique only makes sense in an asset with a steady price, not one like Bitcoin that has been increasing in value since it was created, and will continue to do so.
Also, sign me up for your book. I'm going camping soon and need some kindling.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:35:10
So wait, you're going to sell your gf's gift so you can buy back in? Because if not then you selling at that price and then buying back in are completely unrelated.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:52:52
I agree, it has been a bad investment for only 0 days

Are you new here

It's anything but surefire. I know people that haven't paid taxes on their income their entire lives. If they can tax evade, surely a crypto investor has the chance of avoiding detection.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:42:20
Why would anyone care that you bought 18 BTC at 20k and sold at 10k? Weak hands
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:14:06
When Bitcoin goes vertical, it's time to hold.
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:50:22
There is no dip. It's a total myth. All there is, is momentary fluctuations as the price continually increases. Been like that for over a decade

"Stocks are bad"
*Panic sells*
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:39:44
The big guys would make more money if they held. By buying and selling, they will be missing out on a certain amount of dollar gains. If you are a whale, you can't sell all of your bag at the market rate, as you sell more, you take a discount because demand can't match your supply.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:44:44
Patience is the only good way to miss out. It's going up. Buy now. You may have missed your chance forever to get in at 4 digits.

They aren't. Fractional reserve just means that they have less USD in "storage" than outstanding Tether tokens. So if everyone went to Tether headquarters at the same time and said, I want my USD, they would be in hot water.

Historical context is fine and often needed. Your buy-in point however, is not. It seems like you are just trying to back up your argument by claiming you have made money, and therefore know what you are talking about. We know that these things aren't correlated. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:36:38
What point are you trying to make? It says that Tether owns 0.075 BTC to cover tsx fees on the Omni network. How does a few hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin count as backing?
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:44:22
Well first off, the story seems fake, but even so, losing 10k would not be fun for the average person.

@_date: 2019-10-28 22:06:23
Of course. I just think that if you are going to forego owning property to reduce your monthly cash flow needs so that you can put more into Bitcoin, you may as well just take out a loan so you can put even more in. Which, in my opinion will actually pan out, although I'd never do it myself.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:06:41
It didn't. You just picked one isolated moment in time that exactly fit your example, instead of all other time periods. Unless you are a time traveler and know exactly when instances of financial significance will occur, then your example means jack shit to all the non fortune tellers.

Ahh. The diversification approach. Worst of both worlds.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:03:52
Bitcoin's price is completely irrelevant for becoming a viable currency. The price could be 1 USD = 1 Satoshi and it wouldn't matter. Why do you think the price has to drop? It's not like people have to charge 3 BTC for a coffee. That doesn't make sense.

Pro traders? Lol
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:49:18
Nope. This guy is an idiot. All he did was create a realized gain when he sold, which he has to pay tax on. If he is still holding those coins from when he bought back in, those losses are unrealized and can't be used as a tax shield
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:50:23
Rebuild your BTC holdings but stop trading. Just hold for several years. You'll be fine.
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:05:40
Well, all that would justify would be barring him from using their service. Denying access to his funds is theft.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:46:47
So what? What's the difference between a fortnite streamer saying "buy Bitcoin" and a makeup reviewer on YouTube saying "buy Bitcoin"? Why are you specifically referring to fortnite? Are you familiar with the concept of not being a dumbass? If not, it's probably worth reading up on.

Read the whole fucking comment chain before inserting yourself into it then. I literally asked what fortnite specifically has to do with Bitcoin, and the answer is nothing. And you haven't don't anything to change that. So again, I will kindly decline the note and possibly tattoo some version onto your forehead. Maybe you'll get the picture then.

100% guess. Bitcoin is going up over time, but the path to get there is impossible to predict
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:09:57

He can't offset his gains with the losses until he sells

What's the difference between losing cash, or an asset of equivalent cash value? Or a service of equivalent cash value?
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:17:17
Is this a bait post? You'd essentially lose the asset you exchanged for BTC if BTC value went down.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:19:50
Like any investment, the asset always exists. The only way it goes to zero or loses full value is if it ceases to exist.if you buy one Bitcoin, you will always have one Bitcoin unless the network collapses.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:45:16

@_date: 2019-12-10 14:54:56
By definition it is in fact infinitely divisible.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:16:13

Put his QR code on it?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:41:01
Technically that is correct, but no one would phrase it like that. DCA when the price is going up means you are paying more for the same thing. In the case of BTC that isn't a bad thing, but you wouldn't word it that way. That's all I'm saying.
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:02:29
You buy a marker that is pegged to Bitcoin's price. You don't own the actual coin. You cannot withdraw it to a personal wallet.

Of course not. But you can't say it's scarcer than anything else when you can't measure it against anything else.
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:25:26
Of what not to do?
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:55:46

Get fucked retard. Learn to read before responding.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:30:37
Read between the lines of your nonsense post? OP said most scarce item in the world. that doesn't just include things used for holding value. You should probably read the words actually on the page first before you start looking for ones that aren't there.
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:51:19
I don't need a link. I know what it is. It stands for dollar cost averaging. When the price goes up, if you DCA, your cost base is increasing, which is a bad thing in terms of investing. For the third time, acquiring more BTC at this particular point in time is not a bad thing. However, in general, DCA when the price is going up is a bad thing.

Oh simple, because the parent comment is clearly a hypothetical situation, whereas the second comment claims that something will happen. As the situation is completely unpredictable, claiming anything will happen for certain is down right stupid. Almost as stupid as some fucktard trying invalidate my comment. Good try though! :)

Any amount you buy at is completely arbitrary. Not to mention completely unpredictable. Anyone saying they know what will happen to the price is either a whale, a liar, or a moron.

Don't be so hard on yourself
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:02:52
Of course it will. If you own all 21m BTC, the price is never going to move. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore.

You're a genius who has it all figured out though.

Then how come you have only lost money?

How are you going to double your holdings by buying at 75%?

I mean to be fair they could have just said they were etransfering and make it look instant. It is a movie after all

If he bet his life savings like a fool, maybe.

Not likely today, but it'll happen.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:29:01
What does that mean? Does he technically gain any advantage?
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:34:22
Absolutely ludicrous comparison
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:55:49
That logic is fucked
