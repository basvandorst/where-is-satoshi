No, the people paying money for bitcoins make it the most important crypto. Normies don't care about mumbo jumbo like mining or networking, evidenced by the fact that bitcoin dominance is only 55% and probably much less if you could eliminate wash trading from the numbers.

No. Some are true believers in the religious sense of the word, they will not give up the faith for any practical reasons. More are in it for the money, they've bought heavy bags of bitcoins with actualmoney and need to pass them to a greater fool, hence the furious shilling. Some just want a paycheck, and bitcoin's as good a project as any. For a few it's an interesting research project. None of these things necessarily involve stupidity.


Just to be clear, when I said best option I did not mean another crypto, they're all dying sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:59:35
None of this will help one bit. If computing a single hash becomes cheaper, the hashrate will just go up until the same amount of money or energy is wasted in mining.

Indeed, it's a mystery.
Like you said, you are liable for the same income tax either way, and the capital gains tax you pay for any gains when you sell the BTC for USD is also exactly the same. The cost basis in both cases is as if you had bought them the day you received your salary.

The entire purpose of this subreddit is to tell lies to rubes to entice them to buy your bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:56:25
I don't even know where to begin. Your references are links to companies trying to sell their services to the readers, not reliable sources of statistics. You make up some more implausible numbers and still can barely reach your original 3-5% claim. Most importantly, why are you even mentioning chargebacks?
This here,


is bullshit. The customer has no reason to do a chargeback since he has the right to return the product under the legally mandated return policy and get his money refunded by the merchant. It's a basic consumer protection regulation. It's a different thing if the merchant refuses to comply with the law. In that case the customer is entitled to a chargeback and the merchant deserves everything that's coming to him.
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:55:25


So you just made the numbers up?


This is called basic consumer protection.
