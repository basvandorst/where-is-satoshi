Good write-up! I didn't follow this: what is settled daily? You can only settle the future when you know the price in the future, right?

Twitter says it's rate limited for me. Care to post the link?

But then it's not that you have *direct* control over this $20. I could offer you $1, and say screw you otherwise (and lose $20). You are better off accepting my $1 than receiving nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:09:08
I didn't know that part either. Do you have a link with more information?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:25:01
I thought the same before, but I don't think it's about 1024 or 2048 bytes anymore, it's about a fundamentally different view on the future. 
One side wants to record each cup of coffee, and hence increase the blocksize. The other side wants a different scaling solution, so they reject 2048 based on this principle. They would reject 1025 bytes if that would be proposed.

You're moving 5 figures and can't be bothered to switch to a different UK bank?
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:30:53
Banks would fix this immediately if bitcoin would become bigger. I can send a SEPA transfer in a few days and transfers inside the Netherlands are usually within the same day.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:11:16
90% of the miners leaving seems like a lot. And even then, it just means I can't transfer anything for a month, which isn't a problem for any holder.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:46:51
Haha sure, all those altruistic miners.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:07:25
How is the total supply calculated? I imagine a lot of bitcoins are already lost to humanity. I sure have 3 BTC that I lost long time ago.

Ok thanks. Last time I compared them it looked like the nano s supported more coins, so I was wondering about your reasons.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:59:09
Why trezor over the nano ledger s?
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:26:41


Sure you can. Suppose you would know for sure you could sell today for $600 and after tomorrow only for $100. Not selling the 1 BCH you received is a $500 mistake.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:01:17
Thanks for your reply. I don't envy any moderator of I'm always a bit worried that I'm in an echo chamber if I would limit myself to but the world outside is usually garbage.
How does the mod team think about open mod logs?
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:13:38
Thanks for the historic perspective. I still wonder why (some) miners kept on mining for an almost certain loss at the time. Do you know why?
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:20:11


You mean memes and wild speculation?
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:26:48
Thanks for this explanation. I only didn't get why nodes accept  blocks they think are invalid from the miners. I thought nodes would ignore such blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:13:52
Why would a miner switch increase the price?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:29:32
Q1: it's reasonable safe. If you have decent computer security, use 2FA, don't click on phishing links, then for amounts under say $5000 I personally wouldn't bother with my own private keys or hardware wallets.

"I'm buying bitcoin so I can buy the college"

I thought discussions on altcoins were banned here - why is this allowed?

He shorted bcash likely before making this video. Nobody is really that stupid, right?
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:36:56
Lol half the posts are scams with "$10 free coins for your email"
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:33:48
That was an excellent article indeed
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:32:55
So people can't change their opinion? Bitcoin 2015 was something different than it's now.
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:35:53
So they are doing exactly as they stated (although you might not like it), so that's not evidence you can't trust them.
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:47:06
I have the other sub already for my entertainment :)
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:04:01
Why did you do this? What's the benefit?
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:00:27
I would call it proof you can't be trusted. I would call it illegal.
If you said you would not rob me but woud steal my money, it would be proof you can't be trusted.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:42:28
We need a system to make these kind of bets, like a btc/2x future exchange, where both sides can be matched together. I'd like to bet as well but "a couple bitcoins" is already too much for me
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:31:08
Or don't split and just buy directly BT1 with your BTC :)
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:51:52
Well it works, but the definition is different than you and I would like :)
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:09:51
There's a difference between "acting for their own agenda" and "not trusting". Are you saying you don't think they will do what this announcement states?
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:09:19
I don't understand how they have been able to trace the coins. Why didn't he use a mixer service?
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:34:00
How about we stop with the name-calling? He has his fork, so let's just ignore him?
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:36:27
Why did this start today/yesterday? BIP 91 had a start date of July 1st, right?
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:18:39
What alternatives would you recommend?
