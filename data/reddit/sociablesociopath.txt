They aren't hurting bitcoin because bitcoin is ultimately not an investment, nor do they control it.  No one seems to grasp that everyone buying bitcoin as an investment to convert back to USD is going to be the reason bitcoin does not succeed.
I'm sure 75+% of current BTC holders have zero intention of actually paying for anything in bitcoin.  It prevents the price for stabilizing anytime soon, which also means more and more companies don't want to accept it, even if the LN pans out and more and more people are less likely to ever spend it since they are worried it would have gained value.
Coinbase hurt Bitcoins future the moment they opened.  Lets not even get into the future dilemmas they've cause by allowing people to buy bitcoin with a CC.
Not to mention Coinbases only goal is to get as much cash as possible before the virtual run on the bank occurs.  Coinbase can't fiscally cover all the coins they are holding in USD.  Once people start getting worried and try to cash out you're going to watch as companies like Coinbase freeze transactions and stop processing while the market dips until it gets to a point where they actually have the capital to back all the people trying to dump.
Thats the other issue with everyone trying to use bitcoin as an investment to make USD, as the value rises, your and the new users initial funds don't cover the now actual value of the coins...coins which people bought solely to convert back to the currency you don't have.

Did you invest the 300k?  Seeing as your bet would have already paid off and its not even 2018.

Actually no.  Hardware is not meant to take a constant 100% load at all times.  This is very bad for the hardware in general.  Most large data centers won't let machines run at 100% load for long periods of time.
