A bit late for that. If you have any helpful ideas though, have at it.

Thank you, I am looking into it. 
I have done a little research and I see I was using an older version of Electrum that was not calculating the fees correctly. I was having it decide for me, as I did not entirely understand what a standard fee was and how to do it... so I just trusted what it said. 
Because I did not have the newest version I also did not have the option turned on to edit the fee once it started. I have since turned it on, but I gather that does not help me at the moment.
So it seems I can't do a whole lot at the moment. It tells me my expected confirmation time is "25 blocks" but I am not sure exactly how much that is. 
I am not a total newbie, but there is a ton I don't know and I'm still learning.. so I guess I'll take this as a learning experience as what NOT to do in the future. 
Could someone tell me so I have a clear answer, what is the standard fee? How do I work it out? I sent 6 cents, which I thought (5-6) was normal, but it seems some people are saying that's no longer the case.

I feel your pain. This is annoying. Hopefully it fixes it's self by the morning.

I always thought Electrum was a good one. Can the wallet effect transactions getting stuck like this?

Thank you so much for being willing to help. 
I think I understand all your instructions, however when I get to the 4th step in your instructions there is no option for "Send From." 
Could you explain it in another way? Or maybe I am missing something? I think I get what you are saying, but I am not seeing a way to do that first part before going on to the second part.

Well, I am choosing the right address and I don't get that option... so I am not sure what I am doing wrong. 
I guess I will just wait until tomorrow and hope it goes though. I have looked at other options and can't seem to find any way to fix this.
