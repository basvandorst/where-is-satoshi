glad to see it being discussed over here--I got fooled a month ago and bought some and after visiting hashtalk.org and seeing insane promises and the CEO not acting professional and seeing the forum composed of gullible people acting like zealots and showering "josh" the CEO with praise like he was the second coming--i bailed. Then lo and behold more and more scammy behavior and nutty promises about changing mining and that he was doing it for "us" etc etc and then adding all these idiotic perks to their "hashlets" like having to rocket boosting on their 50 dollar for one gig of scrypt hashing blah blah..its all so nutty. I can only imagine he's paying people back money theyve sent him for pennies on the dollar--every week theres a new promise thats a game changer and it whips the people on hashtalk into a salivating frenzy over their potential ROI. I criticezed it in the comments section in an online interview he did and he made a post immediately in hashtalk to "rally the troops" to stop the "trolls"--Anyhow this will be all very interesting to see go down

wrong. i know actual ukranians in kiev and they want nothing to do with russia-they have theyre own history and language and were made to learn russian--they like most former soviet satellites want their sovereignty and independance. There are some russian loving people in the country but the bulk of ukranians want out of russias shadow and to become westernized and part of the EU. Russia does all it can to stop this

circle is so much better than coinbase--sometimes id forget i even bought bitcoin and it just showed up four days later--using circle and having instant bitcoin is rad--and the app is good looking and easy
