Wouldn't the lightning network not work on BCH since it doesn't have Segwit?

They break into your router and then get the MAC address associated with your DHCP lease. DUH!

You'd have to install radiators on the station, and depending on where it's positioned, if in Earth's orbit would have to have batteries for when it's behind the Earth and has no sun.

Does Gemini support Segwit yet? I haven't figured out how to get a Segwit address to send coins to my Gemini account...

Well considering he became a US citizen he's no longer a guest in the country but a member of the country. Good thing you're not American because wanting to deport someone because you think they're not funny or disagree with their political opinion goes against much of what America is built on.

A paper wallet would be perfectly safe and unaffected by an EMP. I don't know much about how EMPs would affect disconnected electronics (like a hardware wallet) so not sure about the safety of those.
Paper wallet would be your best bet and then you could recover any BTC once you'd be able to get back onto the network.
The only issue, and highly improbable, would be if someone were able to EMP the entire planet and destroy all electronics and we have no backup or way to recover the blockchain. If that happens all of bitcoin would be dead.

Yeah... Things are pretty different from last year haha. If the offense can figure out how to do something we stand a chance. Our defense is going to be the only reason we're in the game if we are.

You technically wouldn't have to send any money to that address, just have it as an output in the transaction you're making. The private key for that address is publicly available so anyone fast enough to sweep any coins out of that wallet would be able to get them.

Moreover, shorting is more risky than just investing. With investing you can only lose up to the amount of money you've invested. With shorting you can theoretically lose an infinite amount of money.

Hey, working on setting up my pi3 with a external HD and 4 GB SD boot drive. Having difficulty figuring out getting the swap on the external HDD. What's the command I need to get the swap on the HDD?
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:22:50
It's basically you borrow someone's bitcoins/stock with an agreement or contract that you'll return it at a later date. You sell the bitcoins anticipating the price will go down. You buy it back later and return it and if the price has gone down you'll have money left over as profit that you keep, but if the price has gone up you have to spend more money than you initially received when you sold so you lost money.

Of course this dip happens just as I'm about to sell of some of my BTC to buy a DJI Phantom 4... FML :(
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:49:41
Easily a profit. I've had the BTC sitting for ages (and I've actually been mining gridcoin for fun for about a year). I had maybe a $100 worth of BTC at most a year ago and now I'm sitting on ~$1500 worth. Not much of a profit, but good enough for something I was doing for fun and not even being remotely serious about.

The sale ends tonight. Interesting idea about the couch hookup though, haha. I couldn't actually buy it with BTC, I ended up using paypal credit. So I've got some time to cash in. I'll probably sell exactly the amount of BTC I need to pay for the drone when it gets to around $3000 again.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:18:36
Maaaan... The drone is on sale for 39% off right now. I'm only selling off a portion of my BTC, basically just enough to buy the thing so I can eat a little dip, but it would be nice to keep a little bit of it
