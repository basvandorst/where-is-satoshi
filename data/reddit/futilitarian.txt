There needs to be a daily reminder here for people to ZOOM OUT.

I recommend watching it for a while and trying to predict which direction the price will go based on the patterns you begin seeing. That was how I learned to read them. Now it's actually kind of exciting to watch.

This is why I asked the question actually. The implications would be massive.

Banks are global.

I personally think this is the case. They are gearing up to play.

Where did you move?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:22

They're gonna rip down my wallpaper and find qr codes printed on the back before I declare anything.

But, at some point, if we know enough Y's for the corresponding X's, couldn't that assist in efforts to break it?

Wish that were true lol. It wasn't a ton of btc so I'm not devastated just embarrassed at myself.

Just had a total lapse in judgement this morning and sent all my btc to a scammer promising returns. I knew as soon as I hit send I had lost it all.
Greed does funny things to otherwise smart people. 
Keep your guard up, y'all.
Needed to tell someone since I obviously won't be telling anyone who actually knows me.

A simple pay 1 get 10 back scheme, pretending to be some benefactor. So stupid.

Someone with a large amount of btc

Thanks, it wasn't a ton but I had been building it since 2015 so I was up about 300%. Thanks for having some empathy instead of just making fun of me. I swear I'm not an idiot, despite the ol dunning-kruger effect. No one is safe if they drop their guard.

Greed. I was possessed by the idea of easy money. Suckers wake up every morning

I just move some of my 401k to a self-directed brokerage. Will be buying GBTC.

Ostensibly because most BTC users are liberal millennials who want more taxing of the rich.
