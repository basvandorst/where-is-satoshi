If you are restoring a used wallet from your seed, it will come across used addresses quite a bit: all your previously used addresses. And it will add all those to the wallet and keep generating until it finds five consecutive unused addresses. Unused, meaning not yet appeared in the blockchain.
As for finding other people's used addresses, improbable to the point of practical impossibility, yes. Just like  every other wallet.

Cash enters and exits circulation through banks, but between someone withdrawing it and someone else depositing it it is untrackable. Transaction happen with no oversight and no record. Basically there is about $1.2 trillion that is unaccounted for somewhere between withdrawal and eventual deposit that is fuelling the hidden economy outside of bank control.
Not an economist. Sorry.

Like when I did my first in person bitcoin purchase at a resort. I was roaming so had my data turned off on my phone, and their DHCP was fucked up on the WiFi (as I figured out later, it wasn't assigning a gateway, netmask, or DNS settings, just an IP address). It was the cashier's first bitcoin transaction, and it was so much sloppier than it should have been. The second purchase there was so much smoother, as I'd manually fixed the network settings on my phone by then.

It generates addresses until it generates 5 addresses consecutively that have no transactions in the blockchain.
Given the seed that you were prompted to record and keep safe when you started your wallet (also available in the menu Wallet &gt; Seed), Electrum will always generate the same series of addresses.

Compilation may catch that with a warning if it's declared and referenced in the same local scope (depending on the compiler and flags, of course). Referencing uninitialized memory is legal (and has some uses, probably all entropy gathering uses)
For member variables not initialized in constructors, where they should be, we're into the scope of static analysis, which is really a necessary tool for financial software, especially in a backbone technology like bitcoin miners.

Please explain what you mean by excluding the ones that are explicitly labelled as hard forks from resulting in hard forks?
I thought a hard fork is when a new fork of the protocol allows a miner to produce a block that cannot be accepted by pre-fork nodes in the network, whereas a soft fork is when a new fork of the protocol may reject blocks that would be otherwise accepted by pre-fork nodes, but will produce no blocks that would be rejected by pre-fork nodes.
Are you perhaps conflating hard fork with chain split, where different versions of nodes will follow different block chains? A hard fork guarantees a chain split in any heterogeneous network, while a soft fork may generate a chain split in a heterogeneous network if and only if a hash-rate-majority of the miners accept a soft-fork-rejected block.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:20:01
A hard fork (like the 2MB change) requires every node in the network to get on board with the change. Any node (not just the miners, every single node) not upgraded will be chain split from the Segwit2x block chain and cannot access it without adopting the Segwit2x protocol. Every other Bitcoin protocol implementation must implement the Segwit2x changes or be cut off.
With a soft fork, only a majority of the hash power needs to adopt the change. Every other node (including non-mining nodes) that could operate on the pre-fork protocol can continue operating on the post-fork protocol without noticing the fork and are not required to modify their implementation. Miners that do not adopt the soft-fork may waste their time hashing blocks that will be rejected by the soft fork (again, as long as the soft fork is being mined by the majority) but that is much less than the complete network upgrade required for a hard fork.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:09:50
I understand your confusion. When the accidental hard fork happened, only miners had to downgrade since only miners generate blocks. A hard fork effects everyone, but only miners can fix an accidental fork.

That address (195jHiWQDLN4sZf1zh9SCU3BMBBhwaYMfF) has not received a 2.5 bitcoin transaction. The closest it has is [this transaction]( in which this address was the source of a transaction sending 2.5 bitcoins to 1DJMe6shG7fwxkvpjcjhfXirUKPA8JaP6X, but that transaction has in input of 6.55832727, so this was not the emptying of a wallet.

Sure, you could do this on your own, if you have several different addresses that have never exchanged bitcoins between each other, and haven't received bitcoins from the same sources, and you have several bitcoin payments that you need to make, and you have enough bitcoins assigned to each such address to cover the costs of each other and you have the discipline to ensure that these addresses will remain unrelated in the future, why not?

~~I like how this explanation also hints at why a new block might not include all available unconfirmed transactions - the more transactions that are included in a block, the longer it will take to hash the block, the slower you can iterate through random numbers trying to get the hash with enough leading zeros. This is why a miner might not include all available transactions in their block.~~ By including a fee in a transaction (fee goes to the miner who finds a block in addition to the [give me some money] amount, currently at 25 BTC) you encourage the miner to include your transaction in the block.

Given that the number of transactions in a block does not effect hash times, what technical motivators are there for miners to not include "spammy, complicated, and small" transactions? 
@_date: 2013-03-12 17:23:06
Not quite. Any miners still using the 0.8 version will now be on the correct^1 blockchain, since it was able to grow larger than the incorrect^2 one. The majority of the hashing power on the network will create the longest chain, and the longest chain is *the* blockchain.
^1 compatible with all clients
^2 incompatible with clients &lt; 0.8

This is true, block chain is the closest you can get to a bitcoin wallet for iOS.

Recurring payments is a trivial problem.
* They produce an address for your account. They keep the private key and tell you the public address.
* Each month they transfer the subscription fee from that address to their coffers.
* It is your responsibility to ensure that the appropriate amount is available at that address (by sending coins to that address). This is the same as you making sure that there is credit available on your credit card.
Why is this hard?

All the seed has ever done is set a starting point from which to generate addresses. The seed alone was never enough to see transactions. To restore from seed and see any transactions has *always* required an online computer. This is not new, nor can a seed generated at wallet creation ever contain information about transactions that will be made from that seed without looking at the blockchain, which with Electrum, means going online.
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:48:34
What else to do? 256MB is not enough to compile with, and using the SD card for swap gets about the same performance on a limited write medium. Using the USB hard drive seemed to be the best solution. For regular running conditions, 256MB is fine. Compile time is really the only pain.
@_date: 2013-01-23 14:50:39
The point of a (good) mixer is that the chain is not just extended through intermediary addresses, it is actually broken. If you follow the bouncing bitcoins, the ones from your wallet never make it to the destination, they eventually make it to somebody else's destination. The correct amount of bitcoins make it to your destination from origins that are not connected to your wallet in any way.

The cold storage feature in Armory is a little bit more than that. You can create an online watch-only copy of your offline wallet and use that to generate an unsigned transaction. You then take that unsigned transaction over to your offline computer with your full wallet, sign the transaction, bring the signed transaction back to your online watch-only wallet and transmit.
