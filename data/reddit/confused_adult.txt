They are for me. Been like that for the last 20 mins. I love them both, but dang it's a bummer for everyone. I hope they get things figured out.

Very Noble OP. Best wishes on your quest to give hope to humanity.

annnnd were back.

Thank you so much for your clear answer. Surprisingly, I actually have that first code, so I'm good. Thanks again!

 shows you where bitcoin ATM's are near you. I don't think ID is required. 
 some sellers allow very little verification. 
It's getting increasingly harder to purchase Bitcoin without solid verification, which I like because it adds legitimacy to it and helps with the negative stigmas. If you want to use crypto for illegal purposes, I've heard you can buy "Monero" without verification.  
EDIT: Oh, it's because you are under 18. Spare my comment about Monero. LocalBitcoins or ATM is about your only option.

Thanks kind stranger.

Thanks very much for the peace of mind.

Oh jeez, I hope this doesn't happen to me. This will be my second time sending to my external wallet from Coinbase, the first time it went through in 20 mins or less. I've double checked the wallet address and its correct. Its been stuck in "Pending" for 2 hours now, no confirmations, no transaction id and nothing in BlockCyper. Ugh. I'll keep you updated. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:09:30
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you reached out to coinbase support? This def can't be normal. Goes against everything bitcoin is about. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:57:21
This is my second time sending from CoinBase. The first time seemed to go through quicker. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:37:05
Great, thanks for your input!

I just moved mine to Electrum. I hope that wasn't a stupid move. It appears to have made it, just only 3 confirmations as of now. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:39:45
That's a good idea. If they can tell you what the actual amount is that is coming from Coinbase before they alter it, you may be able to avoid the hassle of Coinbase support.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:37:28
That's a relief! Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:58:47
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:08:33
Thanks for the advice! Is Electrum a paper wallet? Do you have any suggestions on a Hardware wallet? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:51:00
Well damn, yep gonna have to go to the source and see if Coinbase can help you. They will know the correct amounts. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:32:25
I had this same issue for a long time. I had to contact Coinbase customer service and they determined that my bank was adding a cent or so to the transaction making the verification amounts invalid on Coinbase. Unfortunately, you may want to contact Coinbase support
