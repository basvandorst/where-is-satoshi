It's limited functional utility, coupled with a core user base disincentivized to change, will relegate "bitcoin" to "1.0" technology status

Interesting stuff on R3, I hadn't heard about it until now.  Thanks.  Wikipedia mentions all the banks associated and the, "potential implementation of the distributed ledger technology behind the currency bitcoin." ...but the R3 website is light on specs and the latest blog post  ( is showing someone from another blockchain group.  Do you know if R3 has a white paper?  
I hope the R3 consortium isn't just a looking to facilitate ACH more inexpensively.  What a myopic move that would be.

I've been around long enough to have read the white paper on Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a shining beacon of what the future could be.  I'm for a decentralized future for all humanity.  ...Newer technology is outpacing BTC, not all the "altcoins" are pumps.  I would urge you all to go to those coin sites.  Read their white papers.  ...extend out a little, if not for investment purposes, for decentralized humanitarian purposes.

Well articulated and thoughtful response.  I'll need a few days to really mull it over for a truly worthy response.

I would love for you to point out the technical advantages Bitcoin has over  Ethereum.  Feel free to use big words as I'm fairly familiar with the technical underpinnings of each platform.

Dude ...instant classic!

I'm surprised the rate is that high already.  Those people are pure speculators.  The market rate should dictate the hash rate which we will find out in t-minus 72 hours.

Are you saying having less money in market cap will decrease the odds of a market arising around a forked chain?  Another question, what will you do with your BCC after August 1st?

Take a look at Golem or Storj.  These are utilizing the Ethereum platform but are currently services you could get from Amazon cloud (AWS).  Consider however that the cost to use these two services is much less expensive than AWS not too mention decentralized.  Consider also that Amazon generates more revenue from their cloud services than they do on their consumer site.  You can start to get an idea about the disruptive potential.

Will Kraken be supporting Bitcoin Hard Cash?
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:17:42
and what math is that? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:58:35
Having watched the Ethereum fork closely, I can tell you, the exchanges make more when there are more chains and they will do whatever makes them more money.  Poloniex flat out said they would not support any other Eth chains, then did the opposite.

Ethereum Classic?

Here's the thing, even if you hate BCC, you'll get some if you hold BTC.  Sell it for BTC right away sure but others may hold it.  Then, others will start speculating on who will hold and who will sell.  Bang, now you have a market.

You do understand the difference between forking code and creating sub-coins on a platform right?

I dumped ETC the first chance I got, then watched ETC climb in price.  Why will BCC be different?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:01:04
I see.  Last I looked the unofficial price for BCC was $400.  Got any predictions on where it will land first week, first month etc?

Hahahahah....with the lambo at the end hahah
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:31:17
Yeah, poloniex pulled that with the ethereum fork.  Said they would support the consensus, then decided there would be more trades (thus more money for them) if the fork lived.  Sorry, but I don't trust the Chinese miners.

I'm trading all Bitcoins in for Facebook dollars and Amazon coins!  (snark)
