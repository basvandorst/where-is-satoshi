Because the people who've been losing money and tracking MtGox's graph are treating Bitcoins as a stock/commodity. The people who are holding onto them are treating it as a commodity. It's only fair that you should learn how to properly trade using this tactics. This is aimed at people using bitcoins for investments.
This does not apply to using bitcoins as money, since you're not investing it.

I am also laughing my ass off at the people on over the last few days. everyone jumped in when it was going up (horrible thing to do). It's also very sad to see some people lose more than they could afford, though.

MtGox made a killing from this scheme in the last few days.

It wasn't an intentional and malicious pump and dump.
The media madness and the madness on the sudreddit drove the prices way way up. Too many people believed it would never go down, so they kept pumping each other, and as people bought, the price rised. But then it slowed down and started to lower, and people panicked. They sold sold sold, they dumped what they had and created the pump and dump.

A bitcoin is worth whatever someone is willing to trade you for. It's a money in itself, and it's worth exactly one bitcoin.

You're right, though. The end goal definitely requires different strategies. You agree that profitable investments are risky. I'm not a risk taker so I've been happy with 4-5% ROI on the various investments I have, and I'm aiming for long term growth.
What sort of investment products have you been getting into?

Over the past few days I've noticed bitcoin subreddit is even more rabid on the downvotes of critical messages than any other subreddit I frequent. It's just crazy how fast they come when you don't praise bitcoins.
