How did you store your bitcoin while travelling?

This is well put. Obviously everybody wants the best of both worlds but in real life there are tradeoffs. Compromise is a fact of engineering and if it is ignored something will break.

Maidsafe anyone?

I agree with you that mining is centralized. However miners would also make more fees if the block size was bigger since there would be more transactions.

On the interact website it says no reversals, use like you would cash...

Why is everyone afraid of the Chinese? They are people just like the rest of us. They just so happen to have the hardware and cheap electricity that makes mining profitable. You forget that Bitcoin has no borders.

It's a bad idea since Bitcoin can't be charged back but PayPal can. So be careful. A bad actor will send you the PayPal money get your Bitcoin and initiate a chargeback. You could lose your money

Encryption and programmers will save us from corruption. A transparent government and banking system is in the works. We have come a long way since the dark ages but still have a long way to go.

Electrum works great and gives you full control of your private keys. As always, be careful. With great power comes great responsibility ;)

This why we need a good decentralized crypto/crypto market.

Yes we definitely need a Visa card with the CAD option. I use Xapo now but the 3% conversion fee sucks.

Everyone is assuming it's the BTC that is tainted. I'll bet it's the fiat.
