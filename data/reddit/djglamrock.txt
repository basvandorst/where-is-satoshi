So a double tax.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:08:01
Lol how do you pay for roads! What percentage of taxes go directly to roads? Have you seen the roads in downtown? I would rather have my money back and drive on shitty roads that still aren’t being replaced. Not to mention the amount of traffic back up that happens when they close part of a lane down to work on it. Let’s not forget the bureaucratic process of being able to work on said roads. Labor unions, special interests groups, thousands of pages of regulations. Your average road working has no chance of being able to use your forced tax dollars to pay him to fix the road if he isn’t in s union.
Sometimes the right thing to do isn’t the legal thing to do and the legal thing to do isn’t morally right.

Gemini when I do buy and then I transfer it to my ledger 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:05:26
Yep. I only bought 10 back when they were $100 and now am kicking myself in the ass. But those 10 are more than many people have :)

The future of crypto

Yep

I have monthly buy set up for it 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:54:06
It’s the purple one with stars on it. I got a great deal on it on eBay. It was used so the guy took some of the original price down!

You can get crypto wallets for free. Just be sure you are getting them from a legit place and don’t loose your seed.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:38:26
Yes lose. I might add that autocorrect happens on many phones in many languages. Since you and society understood perfectly my intended meaning, being particular about the distinction between “loose” and “lose” is purely pedantic and arguably pretentious.

Good, I need someone to help pay the new car payment, I mean child support.

I’m giving my family eth for Christmas

Given how much it went up this year alone you would have made a crazy amount. I’m also not saying you should do that. But those people who maxed out their credit cards in Jan and bought btc..... wow 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:42:14
I can’t upvote this enough. People need to learn how to zoom out and know that if you’re trying to be an average Joe and day trade you are going to loose.

As long as you got your seed you good.

Trying to find my ain’t nobody got time for that meme :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:19
If anyone is really confused on what to do dm me and I’ll see if I can explain better to help clear up any confusion or questions you might have. If my grandmother could buy it after her and I had a talk I have faith you can do the same. No dick pix pls lol.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:07:10
True, and I love my nano ledger

I feel like you are contradicting yourself in your statement. If you are just now realizing that people in this sub (as well as many other crypto subs) are more about making money than using crypto to buy stuff, then you haven’t been around since the legendary 10K pizza post. I’ve seen a lot of posts like this and I equate it to everyone on all the different world of Warcraft posts talking about how they have been playing since vanilla. Not very likely, but I get it. You are old skool, have been around for longer than (fill in the blank).
Edit: just to clarify, I try to use crypto to pay for everything. Books, clothing, food, etc. I’ve used crypto probably 15 times this month to acquire stuff.

Some of us may be down 40-80%, but the true ones know this is just a phase crypto goes through. Have a great holiday mate and cheers for being generous to randoms and the bitcoin fam.

Remember that time when I bought 10 bcc for 100 each because I owed a buddy some money for working on my Honda Civic? Well I still do :) stay thirsty my friends.
