Did they say they were supporting the BTH split?
If they hold the private keys, coins are theirs.

It was a pun... "I bet" you learned. Good luck in the future

just like with the drug money... if a bank accepts money from or sends money to another institution for that purpose, they are liable. in the original law there would definitely be some language preventing exchanges from accepting customers with a US address or passport. Don't think for a moment they can't do it... they most certainly can. They just haven't and most likely wont. thank goodness for all of us.

Google calculator.... if you have .35827 BTC and they are worth $4000 per 1 BTC. it looks like .35827 x 4000 = 1433.07

That's what I was afraid of when I first posted this hours ago.

1 law... no bank or financial institution shall deal with crypto. if you can't get fiat in or out, it's just a bunch of monopoly money. Now I hear you, the die hard HODL crowd will say BS, they don't need fiat. Let's face it, right now you can't buy McDonalds or pay your rent or buy gas for your car in crypto. PLUS, if we are going to hit $10k it will be driven by a lot of new fiat flowing into the space. Just like the legal weed guys have a really tough time with this because an old federal law prohibits any financial institution from taking drug money... same law could... not "kill" crypto... but make it totally unattractive to all but a few nerds.

I... the OP... just up voted all the HODLers giving me hate on here.

Coinbase to BTC, BTC to exchange. Diversify....
NOW, with that being said.... for the love of god go educate yourself first and be prepared to lose everything. I’m 99% sure that won’t happen.... but only 99.

don't compare crypto to the war on drugs. you're straying from the point. weed is legal in some places, but those companies that sell it can't use banks....period. because of federal law. that same law can be applied to crypto. it would make life difficult for crypto just like for the weed companies. it won't kill it... that's not what i'm saying BUT if we're going to light the fuse on this rocket to the moon we will need the influx of fiat...esspecially institutional money (banks)

Research..... there are 1000 crypto coins. ETH XRP VTC LSK LTC XRG..... and the list goes on. Some have bigger gains than BTC and are specialized. That’s enough, go educate yourself.

For all the people calling me a fool for selling, I bought in originally at 3800 and was just taking profits. Not a big deal. It was at 5250 when I put in my stop at 4175. To be honest I didn't think it would drop and get filled... but it did. As the price goes up... so does my stop. I just got a little to close on this one. Not everyone HODLs. So I increased my position in XRP to about 65k which will be fine next week I think. I'm just not sure BTC pulls back on this one. This could be the one we've all been waiting for.
