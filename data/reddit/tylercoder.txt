Its not a HK company, they only have offices there
They are registered in a shitty tax haven island which is much worse
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:59:55
Didn't you contact the HK police? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:42:17
Its already been said tokens wont be shares, thats from the previous plan where nothing but btc got socialized. Instead is an iou now
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:22:42
Don't be surprised if some of the people calling them are lawyers themselves

Lets say there's a tc outage, would my wallet work like a normal wallet then? or I would have to rebuild it using a seed?

Its a shady company using shell corps in the most corrupt backwaters, they are unlikely to go to jail, however that doesn't means they wont lose a ton of money if their assets get frozen.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:13:13


After everyone is done dumping their bfx tokens so bitfinex can buy their own debt back for a pittance 
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:57:32
Lawyers and regulators will find it even more interesting 
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:33:51
I agree with a lot of what you're saying but asking to be unprofitable is something they are not willing to do. They rather throw the towel and make a new exchange under fake names.
Have you seen finex ceo? Neither has anyone else
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:43:47
Afaik they already took 36% of all account before going back online
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:24:49
Doubt any other exchanges out there will pass on the opportunity to get those coins
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:56:06
If I was in your place I would sell all my coins and fiat (if you have any) and leave the bullshit tokens intact, that's the "debt" and if you don't sell those you still have a right over the money it represents
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:27:05
Panama would be an improvement, finex is in the bvi, a place know for money laundering and drug trafficking 
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:22:12
Haha they could get an equity loan to cover the users even without that money.
With those kind of profits every bank in town would want to loan them, they already loan to business that don't make money.
This is a travesty, finex users should demand their intact assets.
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:13:25
Unaffected and now former bitfinex user here, I just wanted to say that finex could calm things down a lot by guaranteeing funds up to a certain amount, just like banks do where in many cases they cover your loses up to $250k or so. Imho that wouldn't cost finex a lot and would put a lot of users at ease. It doesn't have to be $250k, it can be something like $5k-$10k or so, what the average non-whale probably had.
These lawsuits get nasty because you have hundreds if not thousands of little guys trying to get their savings back which is understandable because unlike whales they don't have a lot of leverage.
Just an idea
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:47:24
You don't get it, these guys set a bunch of shell companies in the most corrupt tax havens so nothing sort of a manhunt by interpol could get them.
All I'm saying is you should get HK police first, they could raid the offices and get the docs before they can shred them. Also taipei because thats were they keep the money.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:48:49
Most crypto exchanges seem to be like this
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:16:41
The biggest mistake was saying for days that they would NOT give a haircut to any ltc, etc, usd or any other coin holders and only btc users would get it........only to change it to the same amount for everyone.
Imho a more sensible approach would be a smaller haircut for those users that didn't have btc, for the simple fact they didn't lose any funds at all.

@_date: 2016-08-09 18:36:35
Knowing the feds they didn't give any official papers, just the usual threats of crashing a door with guns and what happens happens
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:34:41
Yea I'm guessing finex already took these cases in consideration which is why everybody got almost 40% cut
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:23:01
Nobody knows, they could be open about it and say they are putting X amount of their own funds to help or selling Y amount of shares to get those funds, but for the moment they are not saying anything which imo hurts their image even more.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:37:16
I havent even seen a pic of the ceo
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:47:29
What about people that had fiat currency there? I read on bloomberg that those funds were confirmed to be safe, what are the odds those users will be able to get that money back?
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:26:25
Not for anyone who didn't have btc it isn't 
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:28:23
Let me get this straight: your USD was never at finex but at synapse and so it couldn't be frozen/get a haircut?
Is that correct? and only your btc got turned into bfx tokens?
@_date: 2016-08-09 01:53:53
OP this company is one shady-ass scheme, they are incorporated in the BVI which are only know for two things: scam companies and drug trafficking
The ceo is a ghost, the cfo almost went to jail for counterfeiting, their offices are in HK but the bank accounts are in Taiwan and the servers in Italy, its all organized so it would be a legal nightmare to deal with, let alone that I'm sure they will all disappear with the money way before the cops come knocking at their door.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:24:52
Not a customer and not affected, and those tokens wont be worth a damn after they get dumped
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:44:18

Oh they aren't disconnected at all, they are very aware in most cases, problem is voters don't pay the bills for the private jet and whatnot
Ironically in the long run the taxpayers do end up paying the bills when the politicians pay their favors back through corporate welfare, and guess where that money comes from?

Same government that let an enormous financial bubble grow so out of control the entire country has been in a recession-stagflation for over 20 years.
@_date: 2014-08-19 20:58:43
Well to start I think the biggest issue is that most of this people are uneducated and have very little understanding of how this works. Many don't speak the language of the country they are going to, for example Pakistan has many official languages but none of them is arabic, the official language of Saudi Arabia were many go to work and have trouble with because of that. Also many migrant workers are illiterate.

I don't remember the name of the "law" but is was something like once you read a piece of news that's in your area of expertise and notice all the obvious mistakes the journalist (who is not an expert) made you start doubting everything journalists say.
