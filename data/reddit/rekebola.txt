He also lived on the same block as someone called "Satoshi Nakamoto" IRL. There's a pretty big theory(probably the biggest) that he was Satoshi and used this random dudes name as his Alias. He also passed back a few years ago and had ALS for a while before that. A lot of things that point to him being Satoshi, but nothing confirmed

Look into Hal Finney.

is he sending the original 0.5 back to you once the transaction eventually falls through? also I assume you've tried all the transaction accelerators? even paying a few bucks can get it confirmed very quickly

well what are you trying to profit from that $30? it could quite easily go to $40, $50 even.
But I wouldn't really expect $30 to $500 any time soon

Yeah i've tried multiple times, after one password attempt it says 3 password attempts remaining, i click enter again and it tells me to enter the 2FA code, however it never emails me.
So weird.

So basically out of the 2 bad $25 payments one will go through as normal and ill lose the other $25 and the other person wont recieve it?

I'm also having this issue, did the 2FA code ever come through for you?
