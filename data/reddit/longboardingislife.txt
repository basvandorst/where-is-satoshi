Just only by one of the newer ones. With the natural difficulty increase even with free electricity it will take a long time to reach ROI

Didn't you guys say this when bcash hot $1500?

I did, and do. Now don't get me wrong, our government wastes a decent amount of money like ok corporate welfare, deregulation of medical prices but most of it is helpful. And until we get on the same level as western Europe its basically the best option.

Ok, as much as I like crypto it needs to be taxed like all other investments.

But to play devil's advocate, why does the math make it intrinsically valuable?

Like anyone actually uses Western Union in their everyday life

Is the bch available to claim equal in USD value of the Bitcoin I have or is it proportional ( 1btc:1bch)?

It's an investment company apparently

Yup, men are biologically programmed to take more risks weather it's risky investing or doing something stupid to upload to the internet, the majority of them are men.

How is it dying? Both BTC and BCH  have clear advantages. Bitcoin was meant to be a currency and Bitcoin cash does it better than BTC.

Or invest in general.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:16:53
Maybe they mean taxes, which has many benefits to the average citizen, well maybe not in Venezuela but in general.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:25:40
Why would the goverment do that?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:31:52
I'd doubt that would happen in any first world democracy
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:55:54
