Can’t they just look at my bank statements and see “$500 deposit to Coinbase” “$1000 deposit to Gemini” and then directly ask me where that money is? Seems pretty ignorant to think the IRS doesn’t know where my money is going.

Thank you!

Interesting. I’ll have to look into this more. Thanks for commenting.

I'm new to bitcoin, can you explain why you pay for things using bitcoin instead of waiting for the value to go higher? I want to pay for things using bitcoin, but I feel like I am wasting potential profits by spending it.

I’m not anti reporting taxes at all lol. I report everything correctly. I’m trying to understand why people think it’s going to be so easy to avoid taxes on crypto

So could I technically do this on a flash drive and save me $75? Or is this basically a super secure flash drive?

And they’ll be fucked if they’re ever caught. Which they will be... it’s pretty easy to tell where your money is going.

That’s awesome, so where exactly are the coins “stored” then?

Yeah...  that’s what I can’t understand. Everyone is saying January is gonna be a great month, but won’t most people be selling in January BECAUSE of the 2017 tax year?? I’m expecting a decent dip come Jan 2018

Thanks for explaining!

The fee goes up with the amount of BTC you’re trading though doesn’t it? I bought ~$6k worth of BTC on Gemini and it cost me ~$16 in fees. Surely millions of dollars means a much higher fee right?
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:14:38
How’s the government gonna regulate it?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:25:39
So... buy the dip?
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:54:41
Um weekends are generally low volume and dips lol

Um credit cards give float time lol generally a month after purchase is when that money is due for payment. that’s the entire point of credit. Crypto will never replace that. Until banks start integrating them together, people will always continue to use credit to buy things.

As someone who is totally out of the loop, why?
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:56:35
I wonder if having access to bitcoin will change that

20% swing in total volume over the past 24 hours... we're in for a fuckin gooooooooooood night

Wondering what he could possibly talk about... tech products? I get he’s a big YouTuber but I don’t really see the connection with JRE here lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:39:27
Yes, and the fed rate hike caused the entire economy to dip back in March. Which we are now recovering from. No where but up from here my friend.
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:47:04
Ok calm down bro. Like 10 comments lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:52:23
I hope so lol good luck man
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:23:00
Gee can you tell the future?
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:06:55
I mean technically it’s impossible to know what exact way someone is saying something through text. So no. Not only for me lol
