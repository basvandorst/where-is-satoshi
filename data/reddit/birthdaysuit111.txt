How is, that racist. Colored people commit the most, crimes based on the mean, of the population, of which they accoun,t for a little of 20% of total pop. That isn't racism and if you think it is, you're retarded.

Our gun crime is actually not bad if you took out all inner cities and all black and asian people. Not racism.

Your point? More people die by stabbings in 5 days than the largest mass shooting in US history and/or the amouny of mass shooting deaths annually. Mass shootings comprise of a significantly sml. amount of gun violence with a 53% decrease in violent gun crime and a 47% decrease in gun homicides since 1993, with a significant increase in private gun ownership, hmmm. When you here 700 or 500 mass shootings in total this year, your believing lies and sensationalized headlines. Many define mass shootings in all different ways to try to sway public opinion and sensationalize the statistics. When accounting for the FBI definition of mass shootings and not CNN's. It's around 70-90 people a year. With those scary big black semi auto rifles accounting for 2.8% with the AR-15 accounting for less than 1%. Mass shootings are insignificant when compared to inner city gun violence and gun homicides and if you want to take guns away let alone an ar-15, the most COMMON home defense weapon of which accounts for one of the least amounts of homicides in the US, then your retarded, plain and simple. And I understamd you've never stated this but at least the neoliberals should go for the handgunz first. As for the gun violence, take away all the black people and inmer cities and we wouldn't be on the map for gun violence or gun homicide rate which has decreased significantly since 1993. Also, most of the gun deaths are SUICIDES. Tell once the worst suicide country on the planet, Japan how banning guns didn't stop suicide. Wealth inequality, failing government, health problems, brain infections, poverty, education are all reasons for gun violence, not guns.
But hey, instead of fixing the root problems lets pass legislation that bans ammo and regulation of the ar-15. AGAIN, the gun with one of the lowest homicide rates, accounting for less than 1%. That will combat gun crime, lol. No ot won't, it will merely take away a great hunting gun from private citizens. And with an ever increasing political vacuum that could suck us dry to tyranny. I'll keep my ar-15.
