I have not, it is life changing amount of money for me (37 btc). I almost hit confirm button to import into my wallet but chickened out. 
The last two months I have been obsessed with finding bitcoin using different methods with no result, but when I finaly find some, for some reason I can't follow through
EDIT: I got contact info from whois and will send them an email. :
EDIT 2: Thanks for all the feedback. I sent the person an email:
First of all, I just wanted to let you know that your bitcoins are safe.
You have an unsecured plain text file with your private key on your webserver.
I left dust in the address effected, go ahead and send a transaction to &lt;redacted&gt; to confirm you 
are indeed the owner and I will send your bitcoin to an address you provide.
I will hold these for the next 30 days, if I do not hear from you I will send them to 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE

Any bank that I have utiliZed as a banking partner has not charged overdraft fee due to your banking fees.
Could you imagine the outrage that would cause? There are the people here on earth that will spend everything down to around a dollar or so and not use it again until payday hits.  There would be massive protests on the roads, interstates, letting the people of the United States of America what the bankers are trying to pull. 


I do know that I have overdeadted my account due to a "few" foreign transaction fees and never got an overdraft charge, so you will be fine

thanks for pointing that out

Contacting authorities is considered snitching in my opinion, I am hoping to hear bfx makes a full recovery

I lied, not 30k.

As a former and or current gambling addict, it really made it easy to bypass banking worries when it comes to foreign transactions and cashing checks.
I wish I would have just kept it in my wallet because I really love bitcoin

Why are you so angry and calling strangers names lol
@_date: 2016-10-16 00:17:47
That is not the right thing to do, you should contact the owner
@_date: 2016-10-16 00:19:04
How would you feel if you woke up to your money gone?
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:49:22
No it is called having standards. I lost $59 in the hack but you don't see me snitching anyone out. I'm sure it will get sorted out without calling the po-po. People are so fast to wanna call the authorities these days it's fucking retarded how pussified people are
@_date: 2016-10-16 00:15:43
if people do not want to use bitcoin securely, fuck them

I earn extra money from less tech savvy people, so it is in my best interest for people like op to cease and desist his practices

I did last month for depression, I was put on 100mg of zoloft, hoping that makes things better. My next appointment I will bring up my cripling gambling addiction.
Thanks for the advice, trying to get better

thanks for the follow up, I was wondering what happened to you.
Thanks for at least making contact again, and clearing up what you said last week, this was something I couldn't stop thinking about until I got the closure I got today.
I hope we can get past our differences. I added you as a friend!

Yeah no shit. Here I am trying to release apps Nd every single one of them are flagged by that 007 guy. All I'm trying to do is make a quick buck and ole boy gets in the way

People need to learn for themself sometimes
Obligatory edit: fuck all the haters, y'all wanna spoonfeed technological idiots who can't tell a reputable wallet from a scam. Its not that hard. I'm tired of seeing these posts

I wish you the best, I would love to see bitcoin expand into my community. I am thinking about becoming a consultant and promote using bitcoin to local gas stations
