Okay, and? I'm just saying options will be expensive because of the vega

It's at 17k not 19? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:46
Are there even options on this? 
There's so much volatility that it may not even be worth securing your position.

I'm still thinking it might hit 10k by the end of the year....

Sorry this website is so confusing to me, can you explain to me how it works? I have to make a Second Life account too?

What's your rationale for this?
If you're going to assure people I guess if it goes to 0 you'll cover their losses too? 
All you've said is your opinion without supporting it with any facts or reasoning for why you think it'll go back up. 
This reads like a WSB DD

It doesn't matter what I believe. It matters what the majority of people believe. Right now not many believe in Bitcoin or CC being used as a currency. Even people who hold are treating it as an investment. 
Why would you want someone who invested for fiat profit to sell the coins? Wouldn't you want them to hold it so that it's actually used. 
You didn't answer my question at all. Just told me that if I'm not a believer I shouldn't be here. If people keep treating CC as a circlejerk it will never be used as a currency. People like you spreading hype are just making this more true.

Like, I'm also curious about how liquid it is... 
Why are you being rude for? Am I not allowed to ask questions about a market I don't know about?
