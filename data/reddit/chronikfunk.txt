Thank you but it only states that right now someone couldnt buy them all because they are dated. So coins dont exist yet that might exist in the future. Ok so on a long enough timeline a pool of families keep buying out the marketplace then what?

You think I'm crazy for abandoning or for my zion-agenda-future.

Wait for the next exit scam. It's bound to happen. Let someone cash out a few million and watch it drop back to 5-600 then rebuy.

I compare my bitcoin to Us dollars. If everyone has it what would I compare it to for worth?

you don't think all this hype media blitz and holiday shopping are increasing the value? Im not saying it's going to pop but I do think it will go down a little, plateau, then steadily rise past where we are now.

You are correct however I have not read anything creative . Everyone is talking about only the monetary position of bit coin. I want to know people ideas about combining bit coin with qr enabled google glass. How will this effect the future of qr scanning. There has to be more ideas out there floating in the ether. Right now btc is a commodity slowly it is becoming an alternate method of payment  but is that where it ends?

I can hear the sound of your heart dropping.... thud.
