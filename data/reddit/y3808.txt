No, that's not the litmus test I'm talking about.
I was referring to real intrinsic value.  I can look at a stock price and compare it to a company's assets and liabilities and determine a value that is independent from market speculation.
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  It can't be used as money to live off of because not enough people accept it as payment.  So it's not money.  It can't be a tangible asset because it has no underlying commodity value or practical use outside of market speculation.  So it's not a real asset either.
Strip away market speculation and it's nothing.  As an investor I'm not interested in nothings that people toss around as wild speculation.  I'm interested in the odds being in my favor.  I get that from value, not speculation.  If I wanted random speculation I could walk into a casino and throw money on red or black.

Everything bitcoin related is a collective illusion.  The liquidity of 'exchanges' that are no more than random Internet sites run by scam artists, the prices those 'exchanges' quote, the perception of widespread viability by all of the faithful here or elsewhere, the assumption that every new venture related to bitcoin that comes out of the wood works isn't a Ponzi or just blatant theft.
All of it is a deluded fantasy.
But regardless of all that, the article linked clearly states that this 'fund' does not exist yet.  The subject of the article claims to have another 'fund' for institutional investors wanting to buy bitcoins (of which, there are none).

@_date: 2014-04-03 19:53:36


Because bitcoin is not an investment or finances.
Speaking of your comment about the last 25 years...
The S&amp;P 500 over the past 25 years has returned, on average, about 10% a year, even factoring in the giant crashes in 2008, 2002, 2000, etc.  As of 2013's end, the real compound annual growth rate from 1998 to 2013 is 10.52% to be precise on the S&amp;P 500.
So to correctly rebut your assumption in the first sentence of your original reply, if he'd have done what you are trying to look down your nose at 25 years ago he'd have $121,905.11 to show for his 25 years.  Not -44% in the first few months.  Even if he'd have ridden out 2008, the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 on record, he'd have only lost 37% for that entire year, rather than losing 44% in a matter of months.
This is not counting dividends paid, just the growth rate of the underlying basket of equities.  So his real rate of return would probably have been a tad higher even after fees paid on an S&amp;P 500 fund.
He shouldn't be speculating on bitcoin at all, because the reward does not equate with the risk.  Again, bitcoin is not an investment, it's just a fad.  
If he loses all of his money in the S&amp;P 500 the world is coming to an end.  Corporations will crumble, employers won't make payroll, we'll have soviet-style bread lines, and society will quickly decay into anarchy.
If he loses all of his money in bitcoin, no one will lose one minute of sleep over it outside of his family.  Bitcoin is no more necessary to the world's economy than belly button lint.

Bitcoin is owned by the miners and early adopters who control the vast majority of the 'money' in circulation.


Except when you need to convert the bitcoin to another form of currency, at which point you are forced into dealing with scam artists galore, who are also the early adopters and miners mentioned above.


But no action can be taken against them, exposure is not security.

I used to think this, when I was 19, in college, and had paid no taxes.  At that time not only was I below the minimum tax threshold, I was actually gaining from everyone else's taxes by virtue of being the recipient of student loans.
I think this mentality is symbolic of envy and idolization.  You think if you agree with the billionaire he'll be your friend.  But the only billionaire you know is the carefully crafted fake image of Mitt Romney on TV, which is to say you don't know any billionaires...
Since that time as a stupid 19 year old conservative, I've grown up, actually made money, and am paying taxes (quite a lot, actually).  And now that I have "skin in the game" I in no way want the boat rocked.  
Why, with their livelihood to lose, is anyone else gonna go along with your idea of rebelling against the entire system?  And risk making themselves a victim of their own poor decisions just like the victims of Madoff were?  Because you, who probably have very little to risk, think it's a good idea for those that do have something to risk to just randomly upset the entire economy based on your political idea?  
Why would that be a good idea for them?  
Here's why your idea is silly, you'll figure this out when you grow up...
Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have billions, and the rest of us peons may only have million(s), or thousand(s), but the portion of economic prosperity you need to be content with your life is ***relative***.  With a tiny fraction of what those guys have, I own a house, rent another one in another city, have a couple of cars, and a little single engine airplane I fly around in, and whatever else I want within reason that costs less than those things I can just go buy if I want.
I trade equities in the ***tax money regulated*** investment markets, have insurance on my deposits from the ***tax money regulated*** FDIC, use the ***tax money funded*** air traffic system, park my little prop driven airplane at ***tax money funded*** public-owned airports, and drive my two cars on the ***tax money funded*** roads.
Why in holy hell do you think I would risk upsetting ANY of that, just for your childish political ideas?

There is no length of time that can make artificial market manipulation a legitimate increase in value.  As the above article states, even a ponzi can last a long time before it collapses, and people can make real profit in the interim, as long as they get out before the crash.
But that doesn't change the fact that all of the price increases were not legitimate.  The reason why real investments, such as stocks and bonds, have upper and lower limits on their price fluctuations is that you can apply a real value to them.  A bond can't be worth less than the principal outstanding if the borrower is credit-worthy, for instance.
Bitcoin has little/no value outside of speculation, so it's much more difficult to accurately price.  The lower limit is zero.  The upper limit is how big a scam someone like Gox can pull off.
The words that come to mind in the typical investor considering all of the above is 'DO NOT WANT'.

Hard to believe that people would buy into a fund that clearly states it's going to hassle you to cash out, and that derives its value from a completely shady and unregulated network of exchanges that also operate as ponzis, by refusing people the ability to cash out.
All while charging 2% in front and end loads, and a 2% management fee for a fund that doesn't trade, but rather just sits on one asset.
But hey, don't mind me, just pointing out the obvious.

DISCLAIMER:  *usd availability not guaranteed
None of these exchanges have enough dollars to cover the prices they're quoting on BTC deposits.  Not...a....one.  I have never owned nor will ever own a bitcoin, and I can guarantee you the above.  If they did have the dollars to cover the prices they quote on the bitcoin, they wouldn't have these hoops to jump through to sell and withdraw.  
So everyone with any money or bitcoin in any exchange is essentially playing musical chairs, or russian roulette depending on how you wanna look at it and how much they can or can't afford to lose.

It means that the person interviewed lists his "office" as a residence that last sold in 1993, but he graduated from law school in 2005.  To me that says "mom's house" since he wouldn't have even been an adult in 1993.
Per his info on his own LinkedIn profile he has never practiced law, he went right back to school for a different degree, and his experience is either in child counseling or, most recently, help desk at the university.  His claimed experience with a financial services company is dubious at best, since the company he supposedly worked for is just a domain parked at bluehost.
The associated company lists itself as located in the Virgin Islands but the contact info on their site is a NY cell phone, not a Virgin Islands phone number.  Its domain is registered by a guy who claims to work for a financial services company of "11-50 employees" per the company's LinkedIn info, but the only domain associated with that company of "11-50 employees"?  Owned by the same guy who owns the Virgin Islands domain.
The other article these guys have out there lists two other partners who were apparently employees of a failed casino in Vegas a few years back, but they were IT people, not financial or management.  Their only expertise claimed in that article is "long time miners of bitcoins."
So here, let me see if I can figure out how this works...
1) They put together a bit of marketing info with lots of bogus claims and bogus information
2) People on here start buying into their "investment fund" which serves no purpose other than allowing these guys to cash out the bitcoin they've mined over the years
3) When people demand cash withdrawals things start to get dicey.  First there are delays and promises, then they stop responding to communication.
4) The last thing we hear is all the real money and bitcoin is gone, these guys have disappeared, and there's a rehash of the Gox/Neo/etc excuses on here and elsewhere.  "It's your fault" and "don't trust anyone" and blah blah blah.
That all sound about right?

Your entire theory is predicated on the assumption that the vast majority of exchange prices are not rigged.  I think that they are.  If they weren't, it would be easier to withdraw real money.
Your theory also assumes that any business owner even slightly considers the price of bitcoin in his business model and/or pricing.  I think that they are not.  Bitcoin customers would be such a small segment of any business that they could not possibly affect prices much one way or the other.

In the same post as...


I've identified your problem.  
This is your livelihood man, 'belief' has no place in investing your money.  Everything should be quantified risk vs reward.  If GE goes bankrupt there's equipment to sell, real estate, office buildings, patents, inventory, etc.  In short there's a baseline value you can place on a real company that it cannot be worth less than.  Add that to its current profit/loss/debt and you can determine a real value for this company, today.  Extrapolate that out in the future based on current performance and you can get a pretty realistic view of what it will or should be worth a year from now.
The above is how you invest.
What's the real baseline value of a bitcoin?  ***ZERO***.  
Belief in bitcoin is like belief in a horse winning the triple crown every year.  Maybe it will maybe it won't but there is NOTHING WHATSOEVER to suggest that either guess will be right or wrong.  It's just a guess.  If bitcoin fails what's there to liquidate?  Nothing.  What tangible asset is bitcoin inseparably linked to that has real value?  Not one.
And in summary, technical analysis is bullshit.  There is no chart in the world that is going to tell you what's going to be in the newspaper tomorrow...before tomorrow.

Key word buying.  One guy buying a few hundred bucks worth of bitcoin?  Not a problem.  Of course these exchanges have no problem taking in real money in exchange for bitcoin.
And then we get to the point of withdrawals.  That's the sticky point that seems to drive these exchanges to insolvency on a regular basis.
That tells me that there's a whole lot of bitcoin floating around and very few dollars looking to buy them.
Which tells me that the exchange prices are grossly inflated and not representative at all of true value, but more representative of how much shady exchanges are looking to fleece suckers for on any given day.
In short, Bernie Madoff had no trouble with deposits either, just withdrawals that were the problem!

No one is gonna buy 10 million worth of BTC, therefore its value is?  Zip, zero, notta.
The value of something is what someone will pay you for it today.

I have no money at stake in bitcoins, just a train wreck-esque curiosity.


They **don't** exist.

Corn can be eaten.  Gold has industrial uses.  Oil is needed for engines and various modern chemicals.
Every single bitcoin could disappear from the e-face of the earth tomorrow and the world would be no worse for wear.  In a week, the news stories would stop and the overwhelming majority of the civilized public would not care.
In short, Bitcoin is not an asset.

It costs 10 dollars in electricity to send one dollar's worth of bitcoin through the blockchain.  There is no other payment mechanism in existence with a worse cost structure than bitcoin.


It takes 8 to 10 minutes to send that dollar that costs 10 dollars to send.  This compared to about 10 seconds for a drive thru clerk to swipe a credit card and get a confirmation.
What other opposites of reality are you interested in?

You must be new around here.  If you pay for anything bitcoin related and actually receive a product, ANY product, you are ahead of the game and should keep it.  Because the norm is your money is gone and you get nothing.  See:  anyone who tried to foolishly buy a retail miner.

What, you thought that credit card companies and Amazon would just roll over indefinitely and let you guys steal from them?


Yeah, like a crackhead selling a pair of stolen shoes for half price around the corner has the 'best prices'.  


More like drive credit card theft/fraud.  Just another in a long line of scams made easier with bitcoin.

On the other hand if you just figured out what libertarians were doing (buying bitcoins, buying gold, donating to Ron Paul's presidential campaign, etc) and did the opposite (invest in banks, the dollar vs other currencies, bonds, don't vote for Ron Paul) you would have been a winner on all fronts in the same span of time.

The US dollar has been on an unprecedented bull run since 2009, to the point that it's causing problems for exporters that we *don't have enough* inflation.

By my rough calculations, to run a successful political campaign on Bitcoin donations, using changetip as a guideline (1 dollar per tip)...
About 10% of the people who own bitcoin use or have used changetip. 
But wait...only problem is, that only gets you to half the money if you were to assume that the same percentage of bitcoin users who have used changetip would donate.  We're a 2 party system so logically about half of the people hate Rand's guts (honestly a bit more, since registered conservatives represent about 25% of the population and registered liberals about 35%, but disregard that for now).
So you'll need the entire population of Europe (~750 million), the entire population of North America (~530 million), and the entire population of Africa (~1100 million) to collectively have their voting population suddenly become as interested in US politics as the average citizen of the world is interested in bitcoin, at which point 10% of the bitcoin users of those continents (average number of bitcoin users who use changetip) will donate 1 dollar to one side or the other.  10% of the 2.2 billion leaves you with about 220 million one dollar changetips.  But only half of that (for the sake of argument) would be in support of Rand Paul so more like 110 million.  
If the average presidential campaign costs about a billion dollars, you're gonna need to add some more.
But I figured before I got to that point we should consider the world population, which google determines to be about 7 billion people.
So unfortunately for you guys, but fortunately for me, there's no reason to keep counting these hypothetical people.  Even if you got the entire world in on this, you'd be 300 million short of what it takes to run a presidential campaign from bitcoin donations.
tl;dr:  bitcoin doesn't matter.

You lose everyone at the "dollar is going to collapse" libertarian bullshit.  It isn't.  As your ideology states, mother market has spoken, and has declared trust in dollars a helluva lot more than any alternative.

So lemme get this straight.  You are in a subreddit primarily concerned with ponzis and buying drugs on darknets, in a thread about credit card fraud, making a comment about someone promising you that when your tuition is due, they will pay it for you, in exchange for the preferred currency of the above mentioned ponzis, drug markets, and fraud sites.
And you thought this would *probably* work without being scammed, to the point of agreeing to terms with one of these scam artists.
