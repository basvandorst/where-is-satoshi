Your argument makes no sense.
You're likening "I'll accept 30 X to give you 20 X" to "I'll accept 30 X to give you 20 Y" just because you've decided in your head that X = Y.
Bitcoin is not pegged to the US dollar.

Well it would definitely have to be a *massive* short to make any sense, wouldn't it? 
Wouldn't the cost of conducting such an attack be very expensive especially considering there is no guarantee of success even if they controlled 60% of the network hash power (they'd still have to out-guess the other 40% by 6+ blocks in a row assuming people are waiting for 6+ confs before they consider the transaction confirmed)?
Also as I said as soon as they tried such an attack the community would likely catch on pretty quickly and presumably self-interested miners would bail on that pool like a sinking ship which would prevent them from conducting the attack again unless they dumped even more money into buying back power? I don't know exactly what their business model is but I have to imagine they are making money off of the pool now or building it up to a point where they can so torpedoing the pool would also cost them that revenue and all of the costs they have invested to that point.
I'm not saying it's impossible that any of these things could ever come to pass just that it seems highly unlikely. Do you think this is something that is likely to happen or are  you just mentioning it as a possibility?

I'm not sure if you didn't actually read my post or just didn't understand it.
You're confusing a transaction where the vendor has expressly said "we accept bitcoin" with a transaction where the purchaser has said "you don't accept bitcoin but that's how I'm going to pay so take it or leave it".


Wrong. Merchant adoption comes through payment processing services and the like - companies like bitpay and coinbase soliciting companies to use their service (ie: accept bitcoins). 
Some people take the crowdsourcing approach and organize email campaigns to say to the merchant "please accept bitcoin for payment!" but again that is different than what you proposed. 
Bitcoin is not going to become a global payment system because a bunch of one-off customers went in to a business, made a purchase and then tried to force the vendor to accept bitcoin at the moment of sale instead of whatever local currency they actually accept.
Again, since you seem to be confused this isn't one of the houses that was listed for sale in bitcoin. [Like this one.](


It only seems "dumb" to you because you clearly don't get it. Again, this isn't a business that has been convinced to accept bitcoin. This is a one-time house sale (and not a real estate company that regularly sells property) where the vendor was apparently told "if you want to make the sale we're doing it in bitcoin".  
In any event I find your assertion that the road to bitcoin adoption is to force one-off sellers to accept bitcoin at the moment of sale (at least moreso than some of the actual methods being used as I previously mentioned) as hilarious as it is misinformed.

While Apple could certainly bankroll pretty much any lawsuit they wanted until the end of time I don't think the "drown the other side in legal bills" approach will work here.
Although a trademark has been granted in the EU and Japan the mark "Bitcoin" was known and used by many people/companies long before MtGox ever showed up. Even then, as far as I know they have never tried to exercise their "right" to that mark (I think they'd be unsuccessful) and while there is certainly a Mt. Gox -&gt; Bitcoin association there is no Bitcoin-&gt;Mt. Gox association. Various news/media agencies regularly report on Bitcoin as well without giving any mention of it being a trademark of Mt. Gox (or even mentioning Mt. Gox in the article). 
Apple's popularity is [already starting to wane]( and any attempt to try and stomp out businesses using an obviously BS "trademark" is only going to make them look like some heavy-handed jerks. With the iphone losing the "cool/unique" factor and [losing their top spot in the phone market to Samsung]( I would think they wouldn't be looking to trash themselves further. They are one of the largest and well-known companies in the world so they have little to gain from media mentions of "Apple" (in a "no such thing as bad news" sense) but a lot of that fanboy love to lose.
In any event I don't see how bitcoin directly threatens apple's goals to dominate the online app/music distribution markets. If anything they should be accepting of bitcoin as early adoptoin of bitcoin for them would allow them to put their foot down before someone comes along and makes a "bitcoin itunes" that catches on and actually threatens their market share.

I'm going solely on this article (which I haven't fact-checked but see no reason to disbelieve). I don't have a personal grudge against BFL. Regardless of whether or not the author might have tried to "spin" the article it is clear that this was not a house advertised for sale in bitcoin nor was it for sale by people who are early bitcoin adopters.
Josh twisted their arms (as I said the vendors go so far as to say working with bitcoin for the first time was scary).  Once he mentioned "bitcoin" and figued out these people didn't know much if anything about it, he could easily have paid them the $500k they were asking instead of $500k of bitcoin.
It's not like I'm going out of my way to trash BFL Josh here. Also as I mentioned it was somewhat of a joke in response to the original comment calling the whole thing a troll.


I'm not sure what you're responding to. I never attacked you or called you names, all I did was respond to your points. You didn't understand my point that the bitcoin part of the transaction was unnecessary which I tried to explain to you. Yet you act like all I did was metaphorically bite your head off.

If you read the article you'd see that it was NOT a bitcoin sale. He obviously had to twist the vendor's arm to them to accept bitcoin. They went so far as to call it "scary". Clearly these people don't know much, if anything, about bitcoin. So yes it was unnecessary as he could have completed the transaction in USD without a problem yet he went out of his way to cajole the vendor into accepting bitcoin instead.

Fair enough. 
It is unclear from his post what exactly has him worried - the "reusing the address" bit is what made me think of the k-value (that's how people seem to describe that attack, as a "once you send coins from an address it's no longer secure"). 
Upon re-reading the OP though I agree he could easily be talking about keeping the key offline and either way I do agree that having an "offline wallet" is a good security precaution to take.

That's a good idea. I'm not sure if someone has done this before but something like BAMT but for a node would make it easy for anyone to run a node. Or even a small VM image that someone can just fire up and leave running (I assume you'd leave the blockchain for them to download so the image isn't 15gb.)
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:46:17
I don't see what the panic is all about - perhaps I am missing something.
If you wait for the recommended minimum of 6 confirms it seems highly unlikely that GHASH could cause a double-spend.
Firstly you can only double-spend coins under your control - GHASH could not double spend coins from any address they don't have the private key to. So as long as you aren't receiving coins from a GHASH address that's not a concern.
Secondly, once you have 6+ confirms in order to double spend coins (again these are only coins coming from GHASH since they can't double-spend someone elses coins) in order to double-spend them they'd have to re-create the entire blockchain starting with the block the TX in question is in. So if you're 6 blocks behind then GHASH would need to find at least 6 blocks of the "bad chain" before the honest miners found another block (then they're looking at 7). Each block they fall behind makes it harder and harder for them to create a bad blockchain that is longer than the authentic one.
There would be a significant cost to GHASH to conduct this attack which means the double-spend would likely have to be for a very large value in order to make that attack even worth considering. This cost would also include the potential damage/devaluation of GHASH's holdings (BTC, ASICs, etc.) that they would sustain as a result of any such attack bringing negative publicity to bitcoin and possibly driving down its value.
Is there something I'm not seeing here that makes this more concerning?
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:45:41
It's definitely BS.
Even if this was a legit trademark (it's so obviously not) they have failed to protect it and it has clearly become diluted.

I wouldn't worry about it.
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:29:54
I think there's something you've misunderstood.
from the link:


There is a stark difference between "at some point in the future **maybe** we will do this" and "user x has alleged you committed fraud and we have now opened an investigation". If the scammer in question was actually the victim they wouldn't even know anything was happening before it was too late - they couldn't even argue against the disclosure. 
Also I'm not sure where you live but many places have privacy law which applies here (and yes, IP addresses are considered private information) Even if LB snuck something into the T&amp;C saying "you agree to waive your privacy rights and allow us to disclose your personal information on a whim" I doubt that would hold up in court. 
There is a reason most legitimate/sensible businesses will NOT give out any personal information whatsoever no matter how sad your story is unless you are either a police officer calling to investigate something or you have an order from a court which directs the business to release that information. 
Trying to sneak "we reserve the right to do whatever we want" into a T&amp;C doesn't give LB some magical power to do what it wants even if they've tricked people into agreeing. Most people don't read the long boilerplate crap they are presented before they sign something (do you know exactly the terms of your credit card or cell phone agreement? almost nobody does).
So no, there's nothing to indicate the alleged scammer was given any prior knowledge of this and he certainly wouldn't have given his consent to release that personal information especially if he's being accused of fraud.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:33:47
Are you confusing two separate security issues?
I think OP is concerned about [this]( security issue whereby signing a transaction with an insecure k-value can allow an attacker to guess the private key.
My understanding is that your proposed method of offline-signing does not work to mitigate this attack. The problem results from using an unsecure/buggy client like the android one listed in the article. Regardless of whether or not the transaction is signed offline will not impact that k-value and once you broadcast the transaction if the k-value is not unique the attack can be conducted.
What you propose is a solution to improve security in that by keeping a computer totally isolated from the network (and assuming your physical security is not compromised) it would be impossible for someone to compromise that machine and install a keylogger which could be used to download your wallet, sniff the password the next time you enter it and then liquidate your coins.
So yes offline transaction signing is a good security measure to take but not against the attack I think OP is concerned about.

It probably wouldn't be in a pool miner's best interest not to report that block either since there is no "correct" next block and anyone in that pool or on the network could find a valid block even after you have already found one. 
So you find a valid solution and then because you waited to broadcast it, someone beats you to the punch which instantly invalidates your valid (but not-broadcast) block which cannot simply be slapped onto the end of the other "new block" since, as you noted, part of the block hash is based off of the hash of the previous block.

That's a decent amount of traffic for the average person (at least for people who have monthly bandwidth limits thinking about running a node at home) but not crazy especially given the size of the blockchain.

Bitcoin has very low fees. What you're talking about are fees/price premium people are placing on the bitcoin they are selling as some sort of service fee. It's no different than going to one of those airport money exchange kiosks.. they have high fees but those fees aren't inherent in the currency just tacked on by the exchange kiosk to make money.
As other people have noted the problem is that buying Bitcoin is relatively difficult which is why people are able to charge these fees. Once Bitcoin is easy to purchase I would be surprised if most of these people don't largely disappear. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:54:55


It seems that you already know the answer to your own question.
I would imagine most miners will act to their own advantage. Mining in a pool reduces variance (the bigger the pool, the less variance) which stabilizes profits. I believe you aren't statistically likely to make any more money just that the money you do make is more consistent. 
For small miners with little hash power they could mine for months before getting lucky enough to solve a block. Sure if it takes them 3 months to get 25 BTC that's fine if over 3 months they should earn 25 BTC but after mining for 2 months with 0 revenue (not 0 profit) they're in the hole with no end in sight. They could mine that extra month and STILL find nothing. If they join in a large pool they should have much more success at getting 8.3 BTC per month rather than hoping at some point within 3 months they will find one block.
Perhaps some sort of tragedy of the commons - it might be more secure to have everyone solo-mine but from an individual miner's perspective it seems much more reasonable to pool-mine so each miner will probably say "I'll pool mine, I'm only one miner. Let everyone else solo-mine and everything will be a-ok. One less solo-miner won't make a difference".

To further clarify the "theft" point - I certainly include the Mt. Gox tx malleability thefts as "human error" since although it happened through software the software was improperly designed due to ignorance/negligence/laziness contrary to accepted standards.
Ditto for theft of coins from any scam/startup (human error was providing your irretrievable coins to an untrusted third party to hold for you) or pool or other website glitch (software being exploited was NOT bitcoin but 3rd party software and human error would be in the programming of that software or perhaps server setup such as not using SSL or some such)
So while there have been thefts of Bitcoin they come down to human error at some point in the chain

* Bitcoin is a secure, fast and affordable way to send value (like money) between any two points on Earth almost instantaneously regardless of the amount being sent. Gone are the days of 5-day bank holds and exorbitant transfer fees.
* Bitcoin is decentralized which means **you** retain full control of **your** coins! Unlike a bank account, bitcoin accounts can **never** be frozen or have funds seized by a bank or government entity.
* Bitcoin is **very** secure. No security hole has ever been found that would allow a user's bitcoins to be stolen and **all** known cases of theft are due to human error (the Bitcoin equivalent of leaving your wallet on a park bench and having it stolen).
* Some developers incorrectly believe that they gain security by keeping the code to their software private. Bitcoin is open source which allows anyone to review or suggest changes to the underlying code - there are no secrets to how Bitcoin operates. 
* New bitcoins are created (or "mined") approximately every 8 minutes. Only 21,000,000 bitcoins will ever be created and as of January 2014 approximately 12,000,000 bitcoins have been mined. 
* The rate at which bitcoins are created halves every four years so the 21,000,000th bitcoin is not expected to be produced until around the year 2140.
* The Bitcoin network (made up of independent computers running the Bitcoin code) keeps a full ledger of every bitcoin including when it was created and every transaction it has subsequently touched. This ensures that coins cannot be created outside of the normal process nor can they be copied or spent more than once.

So who do they give it out to?
If you read the terms you will say they only say they "may" give it out (not will) and it doesn't explicitly limit disclosure to one person or group of people (law enforcement, etc.) so implicitly yes, they do give it out to "anyone" since "anyone" meets their criteria for "maybe" disclosing the info.
Also as I noted many places have privacy laws which would override this. Even if LB explicitly said "we give your private info out to everyone who asks" and you agreed they'd STILL have to follow local privacy laws (and yes, an IP does count as personal information).

It hasn't confirmed because, as far as I can see, it hasn't been included in a block.
Perhaps you didn't pay enough of a TX fee or just got unlucky in that miners preferred other transactions over your own.
According to [the multibit site]( you can remove the transaction that never propagated by doing a 'Tools |  Reset Reset Blockchain and Transactions'.
This won't affect your coins in any way since the transaction was never included in a block but if your wallet thinks you've spent the coins you won't be able to use them until you cancel the transaction (although you won't be able to do that if the transaction is subsequently included in a block before you cancel)

That's not inherent in Bitcoin and only because you choose to pay that premium to buy coins off of someone rather than get them at "market" price by yourself. You've obviously decided the convenience of purchasing Bitcoin through these people is worth the premium or, presumably, you'd just create an account on any one of the numerous exchanges and do it yourself. 
Also there are many merchants who offer a decent discount for people paying in Bitcoins for a couple of reasons. 
1) They can still make more money by charging less because if you pay with a CC then VISA/AMEX/MC/etc. will gouge them for a couple percent. If it's 3% they can give you a 1.5% discount right off the bat and still be ahead.
2)They see it as a marketing tool - for example to bring in people who have a bunch of Bitcoins who might otherwise not make that same purchase in cash but think "hey this is just virtual money so it's not as important". This is the same logic many companies use, for example how microsoft used to sell "microsoft points" on xbox live. On the surface it appears stupid because you use money to buy points which you then use to pay for a game which is also sold in the same money you converted out of. However it helps people lose their perception of the actual cost of the product and encourages them to spend more.

"Want to bet on it?" -OP

Yes that was my point. People don't just give away amazing investment opportunities to the general public for free. So when someone acts like they are some great philanthropist trying to help everyone get rich it screams "I'm a bagholder here - can I scare anyone into panic-buying my bag? Hello??"

The point isn't that someone is going to rob everyone blind, it's the fact that localbitcoins.com allegedly hands out private information on its users without their knowledge or consent and without any legal justification. It's not like the police contacted them to ask questions in the course of an investigation or OP showed up with a court order mandating localbitcoins disclosure of that information. He essentially asked for it and received it. 
If you don't have a concern for your privacy why don't you share with all of us your personal bitcoin addresses? It's not like that information will allow us to steal your coins or anything, I'm just curious.

Worst case scenario investors get some/no ROI.

Since the text links were obviously above your comprehension I'll put it in a format you're probably more used to reading.
[Here's a picture showing my comment and the response you can't seem to explain along with me asking you to identify which part of my post that you were attempting to address](

[Wrong again!](
[Here's the post in question](
[Here's your reply to that post](
I didn't explicitly ask you about Bitcoin, I asked you, and I quote, ["So which part of my comment that you replied to are you addressing?"](
[Apparently being unable to understand such a simple question or elucidate whatever your point might have been, I had to ask you again](
You then blather on in what is a hilariously embarrassing (for you) sequence of messages in which you tunnel vision in on Bitcoin for some reason, instead of just answering what couldn't be a simpler question. 
You're the only one standing in a hole here, buddy.

That might not be true. I would guess that if the CC company can make the case that your negligence in some way caused the breach then your liability would be greater than 0.
Something akin to having your car legitimately stolen vs leaving it out front of a shopping mall with the keys in it, running and having someone take it ([regardless of how badly it stinks](

*I* was talking about Bitcoin. You replied to my post with a seemingly irrelevant article.
So again I ask you, which part of my comment were you attempting to address?
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:30:37
I'm going to give you give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you aren't really *that* obtuse and you're just being difficult (as mentioned: internets).
So I'll say it a third time just for kicks:
You replied to my post with a seemingly nonsensical response. I would like you to clarify which part of my post exactly you presumably attempted to provide a cogent response to.
Is the problem that my question is too complicated for you to understand?
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:22:18
Unlike you, I am not astonished. Your pattern of posts is typical of a fair portion of the internet.
Lots of filler and no substance. 
(You keep posting but have still failed to elucidate a point).
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:07:38
Yes and then once I mentioned Bitcoin you replied to that with a reply that was seemingly nonsensical. Which is why I have twice asked for clarification which you apparently are unable or unwilling to give.
and if you consider a random comment thread on a non-front-page post "the limelight", I feel bad for you son.
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:31:37
I'm not sure I see your point. That article mentions nothing about Bitcoin much less the Bitcoin community.
The "poor" Americans in your article are rich if you put them in context of the entire world. 
So which part of my comment that you replied to are you addressing?
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:01:28
If $5k and a ticket on a commercial airliner qualify someone as "rich", I can only imagine how terrible abject poverty is.
@_date: 2015-04-04 09:40:39
Who said it was difficult?
The only thing that appears to elude both of us is, what is your point?
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:32:10
OP hasn't said anything to suggest that the $5k wasn't to pay bills (or that the plane ticket wasn't work-related).
I would guess that currently the demographic of the Bitcoin community as a whole is far wealthier than the demographic you describe. By your standards the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin users would probably qualify as "rich".
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:29:09
Consider the context. We're talking Bitcoin community here. 
I don't have a source to back this up but I would guess that the 75% of the world you refer to makes up 0% (or very close to it) of the Bitcoin community. Which means that there is no sense using it in this context as everyone in the community would be "rich".
