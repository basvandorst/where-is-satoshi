Is it possible to refill a channel with an on-chain transaction ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:09:54
No, data centers can easily cope with about any amount of data I can think of. But as users, we will have to rely on SPV wallets. 
The network will remain decentralized in some way, it is the businesses that uses the blockchain that would maintain nodes.
The lead dev of ABC was [interviewed on the subject]( last year, it's an interesting point of view on how it could be possible to deal with these massive amount of data.

They will raise the blocksize. The default blocksize will be set to 32MB on january, 14th when the new address format will be deployed, and blocksize is planned to be totally removed the hardfork after this one...

I wanted to say : Sending money one user to another, directly or passing thru hubs. 
The money that has to be locked in the channels between each hub may put a limit on the maximal amount you can transact (you may need to split the tx in several part - nothing impossible).
Routing may also be a limitation factor as right now, reliable and fast routing is only possible if all nodes have a map of the whole network (but I am confident these things will evolve in the future).
But I doubt you will ever pass smart contracts thru LN.

Nothing prevents LN or any 2nd layer solution to be implemented on top of BCH... (In the case specific of LN, a malleability fix would be needed - it's planned for end of 2018).
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:25:50
Oops... I wanted to write "...the blocksize limit is planned to be totally removed..." (the blocksize limit is already a variable in a configuration file, but there is currently a hard limit of 32MB)... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:43:39
On chain allows much more flexibility. From what I've understood, LN will be limited to sending money from one user to another. On chain allows much more complex operations, and it is the way BCH developers seem to take (enabling older deactivated op-codes are planned, talking about introducing new op-codes...)
On chain is also much more easy to implement for businesses : the technology is known and has already been deployed, it is easy to maintain because it is stateless (if your node has a problem - just reboot the daemon), and if you need it - there are many people around with expertise in the field...

May I ask how you choose people/exchanges to trade with in such a situation ?

In case you didn't notice, Bitcoin has been taken over since long ago...
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:43:54
In case you didn't notice, [hashpower overwhelmingly still support the NYA]( This means the "No2X" chain may be left with (very) little miner support...
Hence no need for replay protection...

A decentralized bitcoin where users are bound to use a middleman to transact is useless as a P2P currency.
I have nothing against second layer solutions, as long as it is allowed to transact on-chain, without having to involve any third party. Bitcoin without the possibility of on-chain transaction is a negation of the original whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:53:42
If decentralization is about putting a 3 to 5 transactions per seconds cap on a network, it's a useless decentralized network.
This speed doesn't match the capacity requirement by orders of magnitude, even if 2nd layer solutions are adopted.

No, segwit blocks are 1MB. There is extension blocs for singature. Only usable to store segwit transactions signatures (hence the name : segregation witness).
On contrary LukeJr wanted to reduce the size of the main block to 350kB : see [here]( or [there](

Bitcoin is about money and takes the economic governance out from the hands of states. 
Like it or not, _every_ design solution in Bitcoin _is_ about politics.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:19:37
It's nearly impossible to enforce miners to follow KYC. It is _very_ easy to force professional service providers (like exchange, LN nodes operator) to enforce KYC, because they have direct contact with the customer and their service is about maintaining a customer account.
So, unless you operate your own LN node (I don't expect much less people doing that than running a P2P node), every move you make will be _much_ more easily tracked as with the current bitcoin network (where it's easy to follow money, but not very practical to identify a savy user.)

UASF please ! Then you can fix whatever bug you want.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:23:11
Then why do you said "No..." ?  
Consider this :
1/ Separation of the signature is only allowed for segwit transactions, therefore regular transactions don't allow the capped blocksize to contain more transactions.  
2/ When you separate signature, you __may__ have a block+extension bloc size that is up to 4MB (you have to process/transfert the extension bloc constaining the signature). Segwit transactions are not smaller, it's just a new transaction format that stores a transaction in two distinct areas (one part in main block, another part in the extension block).
Then, if the only benefit of segwit vs a bigger blocksize is malleability fix and quadratic hashing, why not get rid of the signature separation/extension block complexity and use big blocks with a transaction format that solves the malleability fix and quadratic hashing ; this would benefit not only for the new transaction format, but also to the old transaction format.

I agree to a certain degree. But LN is not ready yet and we need to clean the backlog ASAP. And bitcoin shall remain a P2P currency. I have nothing against 2nd layer solutions, but anybody who wants to make onchain, permissionless transactions shall be allowed to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:49:57


And what do _you_ say ?
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:32:10
Miners only know addresses. Beside some that are "well known", they cannot link addresses to customers.
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:42:31
Well a simpler answer was 33602.15 tx per bloc.
Try that with 1MB blocs.

My point is : we _need_ urgent block capacity ASAP to clean the transactions log and to allow the use of Bitcoin to grow.  Because we are at least months away from a working LN production ready implementation.
We _need_ a lot block capacity in the long run anyway. Therefore, there is no point in limiting block capacity. LN or not LN, sidechains or not sidechains.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:06:51
USAF doens't include _any_ blocksize increase. This translate in exacly __zero capacity increase__ until segwit format tx are used. And given LN won't be production ready, at least for month...
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:50:41
99,9% of the LN nodes will be subjected to KYC laws.
Miners are not.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:17:34
I don't talk about transacting onchain. Just using the chain address as a saving conto, and doing every single other transaction thru LN. BTW, open/close a channel every month with LN is _very_ optimistic to say the least.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:46:51
With big bloc size, there is no need to have a discount in fees as an incentive to remove the witness from the main bloc.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:39:27
I don't speak about flextrans in particular. There is no reason segwit transaction format couldn't work without splitting transactions - 
I just try to point out that extension blocs with transaction splitting will be an unnecessary technical debt in the future (as opposed to an equivalent bloc size increase).
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:19:16
But you didn't answer. How much tx must fit in every single block, for less than 1 in 100 person in the world performing an opening and a closing of a lightning channel _every month_ ?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:04:23
Let's say less than 1% of the world are using bitcoin as a saving (digital gold) and use LN to transact. They open and close a LN channel once in every month. 
How much onchain tx/s would it need ?
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:48:50
I'm not sure you know how lightning network is supposed to work.
