Does it matter when they've never been wrong on a single prediction?

Does it matter when they haven't been wrong once?

It has not been debunked. The edits on Old_Negotiator’s post we’re made around the same time the newer post was made (middle of July), which is also when Old_Negotiator edited a comment to say they came back as BitcoinTimeTraveler. I know because I read them both at the same time weeks ago. In the newer post by u/BitcoinTimeTraveler, mid July they made the exact same prediction on Epstein being suicided.
I could have predicted he would be suicided. But to specify that Trump would retweet a tweet the same day as the news of Epstein’s death came out blaming the Clinton’s is eerily on point. The true test of this will be whether or not Trump was indeed behind it. And, as you say, whether or not BTC hits 100k in 2019 or not. We shall see.
You want to debunk the claims made by OP? Link me a screenshot proving this “time traveler” didn’t call his shot mid July in the most recent post they made, pre-edit.
Again, the backstory does not matter; time traveler or not the predictions have been on point every single time. If I’m wrong please prove it, I’d love to know. This is all very weird, to be sure.

My point is, time traveler or not, their information is correct. That is where the value lies; not in the backstory.

Look up screenshots from pre-edit, weeks ago. The Epstein comments were included.

I was speaking of the comment made in this post: [ by u/BitcoinTimeTraveler, not u/Old_Negotiator. Link to that, and I shall admit defeat my friend!

A lot of us could have predicted that. And a lot of us could have predicted Trump would blame it on Clinton. But to specify that it would be a retweet from Trump the same day as the announcement is eerily on point. I suppose we will know for sure if Trump ends up being behind it.

This is true. The part about trump retweeting and blaming it on Clinton is predictable as well, although eerily on point; what if he decided not to do this? I guess we'll know for sure if it turns out Trump was behind it.

I actually remember this, I believe. Someone needs to post a screenshot from imgur of the original post, to crosscheck whether the edit added in the Epstein part or not. But again, I remember reading this weeks ago and I could have sworn it was included. I might be wrong though. Somebody please prove one way or another.

So then my original plan of buying off Coinbase and transferring straight to my trezor wallet will work fine? I would like to buy anonymously if possible, but from what I understand it is much more practical to just use Coinbase?

Once I store my crypto in the trezor wallet, will I need to plug it in or “check on it” once a year (or something like this) to ensure everything is running good, or can I leave it in the trezor for years straight offline?
