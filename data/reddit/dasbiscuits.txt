You sound like a self righteous vegan who does crossfit. Yes I live off btc but I'm not going to hinder myself because the rest of the world doesn't.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:04:11
I'm thinking there's a pay option in it. You could upload to mega upload for free

What if they went over and beyond?

This graph doesn't include transactions out of local bitcoin's scope. I've sold 200$ worth this week alone via text from repeat customers I've met through local btc. Good stuff
@_date: 2015-12-01 02:53:23
Interesting take. I like that too! 
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:33:40
Just seen this on my facebook feed. Crikey!

What is gbtc?
@_date: 2015-12-09 16:16:07

What would you call it?
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:03:15

Could you buy dogecoin and transfer those funds out? 
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:16:46
For sure man. I try and promote it every chance I get so much so that my friends pull out their hair when I talk about it. But yea man, when I get off work I'm hitting up all the places around me that are cash only. Figure they will be the easiest to convert since they already hate fees.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:53:43
how many bitcoins do you have in the center thing?
@_date: 2015-12-21 11:32:18
I noticed upvotes are enabled on the Coinbase hack post. Is there a certain threshold that allows the censorship to be lifted? 
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:13:13

Thanks for sharing! 
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:30:19
I've been using the app since last week. The pending bitcoin transactions are from the 20th. How exactly does it take for a transaction to convert into bitcoin? I seriously love the app but there needs to be more details. Like what does the ticking time clock mean. Obv it's a pending transaction but can you give a description of the time left or why it's pending when you hold your finger over it?  
Edit: sorry, texting this on the bus before coffee. Many typos.

I'm currently mining libertycoin. I'll def check out your suggestion! 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:16:35
My thought exactly. I drive up to Wisconsin from Chicago every 2 weeks to buy a small truck load of their brews. I always try and purchase them with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 22:46:44
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:06:04
Cloud mining could be a scam. I got in early with gaw and made a hefty roi. I would not suggest getting in now however. Like anything really getting in early pays off. Honestly the best bet. I see now is buying cheap btc now and cashing out on the rise. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:37:05
Have printing connections in Chicago. Shall we do a bitcoin meetup? 
@_date: 2014-09-26 16:43:30

@_date: 2014-04-25 04:00:02
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:23:53
I do ask on a daily basis. When you get snobbish reactions like "their just going to shut that down" or "that's illegal". It's hard not being a dick and asking yet another question like who's they? And how do you shut down a decentralized network?

 I already made a. sweet roi with gaw. Got in from the start though. Interested to see where this goes. As of now no i would not invest more. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:43:01
It was a bad joke. Fuck Florida. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:56:56
Yea, I know just a crazy idea. How about instead of having all websites accept Bitcoin we create a website that's the middleman someone purchases with btc and we pay with whatever means the website accepts? I doubt that's even possible though
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:46:20
Lol right because everyone doesn't have a price. Hilarious
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:25:23
Lol what are you doing in the real world? You don't even know what I do for a living and how I use Bitcoin everyday.  You seem so narrow minded it boggles my mind that you are even into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:40:32
This guy is retarded, I used to watch some of his material. When I seen the episode with max on it and what he was assuming on Bitcoin, it really made me think that everything else he preaches about is probably wrong.

@_date: 2015-05-29 17:33:51
How much btc do you own?
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:25:28

@_date: 2015-05-03 14:13:48
Sounds fun! Though at a 5$ buy in I still get pissed when I'm knocked out. With a 1 btc buy in...I'd probably lose my shit. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:04:12
I had the same experience as OP here. Was waiting in line and just wanted to test it. The total transaction from my bitcoin wallet to paying for the coffee took less than 30 sec.

Right now only 3. Had to cash in for this move. Not really a big deal lol. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:46:48
Did the same thing with gyft. Super fast! :)
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:56:56
3-5 business days
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:48:14

@_date: 2016-06-03 17:27:45
Isn't coinbase fdic insured?
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:56:14
Get a shift card.  
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:08:47
Or in a sell for 10 btc...see what that comes to compared to coinbase
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:57:17
I thought circle didn't have fees but they do. The fees are hidden when you add larger amount of sells
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:36:22
holy shit! I drive past here every day on my way home from work and always wondered to myself why pawnstores do not buy and sell bitcoin. Awesome! I'll stop in sometime. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:21:01
No time frame really. Just want get back into mining
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:56:19

@_date: 2015-08-31 13:20:18
Yes. I've mined before with gpu's so I told him the electric cost would be big. He doesn't care. This guy is loaded and doesn't give a shit
@_date: 2015-08-23 13:02:50
I personally dislike this guy. He's like the unfunny crypto version of Gilbert Gottfried. Always yelling about something. And he has shit altcoins that he likes to pump. I just get that shady vibe from him. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:57:45
How much are you looking to do? I could be your buddy, guy. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:21:37
EBay a pretty risky place to buy miners?

I'm not just going to ask him for money to buy btc. I  want to get back into mining since it brings me a lot of joy. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:49:22
Actually no. I don't talk like there's no development going on. I'm sorry you misinterpreted the text. Even a blind man can see that development is having a network effect. What I'm saying is nothing lasts forever. I might have gone over the edge with "destroy" but yes I do wish that we find problems, hacks, etc. If we claim to know everything then how can we learn? We're in this together brother.
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:11:36
I have the green light to the person it would piss off. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:25:29
Actually I explained how to buy bitcoins with circle and coinbase. If that's not an option I have no problem meeting again. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:42:04
Can you come to Chicago? If so I can do this. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:12:35

@_date: 2015-07-27 11:44:52
What's stopping companies like Intel who are making chips for 21 not just make chips for themselves and just start mining. Is making bitcoin mining chips the same as making chips for pc laptops or tablets in the sense that you need to sell them to make your profit. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:40:24
It very well could be an adult job. She did say she was a massage therapist. I'm not worried about my accounts being shut down either. I don't send direct from purchasing accounts.

@_date: 2015-07-16 13:20:57
As much as I want to believe this, no ship is to big to sink. We might not have the iceberg today but there's always tomorrow. I actually want something to destroy bitcoin, so we can rebuild a bigger and better protocol. I want to be proven wrong to learn. I'm not just trying to be a pessimistic neck beard.

Well if it has real world applications and is cheaper and more secure than other payment systems I honestly don't see how it can't catch on. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 03:16:54
Does your wife have a checking account? If so, I would just connect that account with coinbase or circle. Deposit bitcoin in the wallet connected to the account, sell bitcoin, wait 3-5 business days to clear then do auto deposit. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:43:33
I'd ask for a dollar
@_date: 2015-04-21 13:01:45

Super excited for the tip I bet.
@_date: 2015-09-14 11:45:57
The conspiracy guy at work told me. The crazy guy who eats raw chicken. He told me about this decentralised currency which I didn't really care for but he went into detail on how the network was secured. That my friends blew my mind. 2011 gpu race was set. It was the best time in my life technology wise. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 12:38:24
 I think the first killer app is currency yes, but are they trying to categorize the technology? I don't think they're digging that deep though.

I bet when he gets out he'll be all jacked. He'll make work out videos and sell them for btc
@_date: 2015-04-27 12:21:21
What's more important? Companies accepting bitcoin or focusing on easier ways to aquire bitcoin in areas where circle or coinbase etc is lacking. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:17:23
I did this for this year's Christmas for my tech team. They really don't know what bitcoin is or have much interest in it. I framed them a nice picture. It's the Google search bar but in a Mail in envelope. On the back I wrote out intrusions on how to claim their btc with their key. I'm not going to tell them it has a bitcoin attached to it. I'll tell them that at this moment this picture is worth x amount and to never throw it away. They'll also have to figure out how to claim the value of this picture on your own. I backed up the keys in case the picture is lost or stolen. Can't wait to give it to them!

@_date: 2015-11-19 14:49:31
Could you buy doge or ltc and transfer those out? Worth a shot
@_date: 2015-11-14 13:32:48

What country right now would benefit the most using bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:15:40
Hell yea. Lawnmower is dope!
@_date: 2015-11-20 13:08:42
With the lawnmower app, I'm buying bitcoin everyday regardless of the price. It's awesome to see a wallet grow.
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:32:48
Sounds dope
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:33:43
I'm guessing that he is referring to the crash. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 05:42:08
Yup got one
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:38:57
Tequila bottle. Tres commas
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:26:01
Been using this service for about 3 months. I'm almost to 1 whole btc!! I love how the lawnmower app auto creates it's own wallet on your coinbase account. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 12:04:50
Check out foodler. Can't believe I just stumbled upon it. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:58:34
Thank God this didn't happen when I ordered my pizza. Thanks for the reminder just moved it to my wallet :)
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:40:00

@_date: 2015-10-26 17:33:10

@_date: 2016-07-17 03:27:41
I'd like to know the total of bitcoins  that are lost forever
@_date: 2016-07-30 06:48:26
I've never had a problem with them and I've been using them daily for the last 3 months. Coinbase+shift=amazing!
@_date: 2016-07-13 00:11:18
They already do with shift.  I use it in daily
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:23:56
Good thing nobody clicks on Google ads
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:29:19
@_date: 2016-07-08 18:56:06
Been using mine for about 3 months.  Perfect.  What's amazing if you need to up your limits, you just edit it online. No calling bullshit
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:19:24
Thanks amigo!
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:33:00
That's awesome man. I bought 25 shares out of 30,000 for 3.50 on a 3000gh/s rig. Hoping that pans out lol. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:26:56
Lol please tell me more on how I'm a moron when I didn't pay a dime for this rig and I have free power to run it? Anyways thanks for the comment. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:11:45
Thanks for the tip amigo. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:30:52
Thanks for the input!!
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:15:02
Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:22:43
I love you guys :) 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:25:36
Appreciate the time you took to share. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:19:03
Exactly, that's what I told them. They were so concerned with machines selling out or getting it much later than others. I told them I didn't have all the info but they just wanted the rig. Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:35:52
Well I already have a gaming machine I7 4770k gtx 780ti etc... And this was friends wanting a rig and wanted me to buy it. I'm not going to steal my friends money...
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:38:39
I was looking into that with litecoin but it seems you need memory Wth an asic chip. I'm not 100% sure on it though. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:10:02
Not my money. I was put in charge of buying this rig. I haven't paid a dime. :) but thanks for the constructive comment. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:31:35
Thanks man
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:47:58
You're full of assumptions, and wrong again about a dorm. I don't get why you're so getting frustrated about me doing friends a favor. They asked for a mining rig and I delivered. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:30:08
Thanks!!!
