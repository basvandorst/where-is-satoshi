No man, you can use your crypto as a prepaid card and top up your funds there. Once you do it, you can use it whenever you want to. I honestly believe this is a way safer to use your funds.  Check out cards website they have it explained it in detail :  [

Hmm, interesting read. Crypterium will be really useful for people there.

Honestly, we could see more benefits of crypto and use way more potential for transactions. Anyway, it seems like this is good thing for Bitcoin at the moment. Nice article!

How you some random merchant will accept your crypto, you won't exchange it in kind.? You will need part to centralize to make i global, no other way around.

Yeah, just can't wait for this soluion and start using it!

You just said contradictory statement. There is no possibility that you can make double spending if your transactions are updated on a chain, as they will have to do it later on. Off-chain transaction system is for internal things, to make service faster. If you believe that crypto should be a complete anti-bank, maybe... and how you make that service global? Just posting negativity to someone else work isn't a good deed.

Interesting is that with these UnionPay card you get better security of your data, so I guess it is way better than doing it with the MasterCard and Visa. That is why I like this project so much.

Is that even a point, it can be their first card. Obviously you are promoting someone else, just get lost if you don't like project.
