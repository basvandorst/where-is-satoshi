If we can get everyone to believe it will be $2mil by the end of next week, we can get rich, boys!

Some people know when to cash out on people's fears. I knew the second it hit $20k, that would be a huge milestone for people to realize "oh shit, they said it was going to hit $20k, that's when I'm going to jump ship before anyone else does". And sure enough, it touched to tip of $20k and went downhill from there, because everyone had that same realization, it was a checkpoint. And that's when I dumped everything as well. And now, I can buy double of what I had before the next bubble.

Loans cost interest over time, and bitcoins are literally about time and patience. Now, not only do you have to worry about bitcoin prices everyday, now you have to worry about a loan of money that is increasing as well, reducing your profits... I've always wondered who the fuck goes to those back rooms of casinos that say "leverage your house or children for some more $$ to gamble because you clearly can't afford to take these losses with the money you don't have"..

Lol banks never lose. They'll write it off, assuming they even report it.

If you would kill yourself over not having $50mil that you would have never otherwise had anyway, you're probably not stable enough to handle that kind of money in the first place. If $50mil is the only reason to live even though you've gone your entire life without, sounds like you both needed help.

Go to parts of NJ and you'll see things you'd only find in 3rd world countries. And yet they live in a wealthy state, let alone a rich country. Ignoring happy people in 3rd world countries and only using your narrow minded experience/a Youtube video you once saw of highly oppressed people in a 3rd world country and using only the worst as a comparison to the US but forgetting to include the absolutely disgusting conditions some Americans live in, it's kinda stupid of you, no?

Sorry guys, didn't know there was a known issue with bitcoin tickers. I can make the source code open to anyone who still wants to have a bitcoin ticker but can package it themselves.

I know the feeling. I also bought my first couple at 580, bought one a few weeks ago at 480, and just bought one today at 390. It was 650 for a little while so I figured 580 is a steal! Then the next morning, 415... Fuck. Now I have 5 bitcoins worth about $2000, but I paid almost $3000. Maybe if I buy more I'll feel better...

Really? Did not know this. Guess that's why you don't see too many in the extension store. Thanks for heads up

Yes it does? It paid off. Going to college and getting yourself into $250,000 with no job prospects or guarantee just to spend the next 30 years paying it off at a job you could have gotten with a liberal arts degree is stupid. Being terminally ill and selling your house to invest in a skyrocketing asset isn't stupid. Sitting here and calling someone who made an investment and tripled it in a few months is fucking stupid. You. You're stupid. And salty.

You sound like a dad that just signed the deed of the house over to the casino for one last ride on red. This is a sever gambling addiction, he literally sold his house and everything he owns to gamble. This isn't investing or healthy no matter how you spin it, you wouldn't be defending it if he did exactly the same thing at a poker game or blackjack. No difference whatsoever.

I sold 10 a few months ago when it was $350... I'm very salty right now

Sigh... I listened to the "experts" on this sub and sold 10bitcoins when they were $300 because "bitcoin will be dead in a year".. Coulda had $18,000 today. Such is life
