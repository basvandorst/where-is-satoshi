11.332 sat/B ?!  I though I was cheap when I got a 100 sat/B transaction stuck.   Your fee is not nearly enough to get on the chain right now.  The current recommendation for a quick transaction is around 400 sat/B.  This is higher than normal- there's a huge log-jam right now.  Your tansaction is ~500 B so get on the chain tonight, you'll need to set a ~0.00240000 btc miner fee or wait till the volume comes down.  I was able to increase a fee on one of my stuck transactions by submitting a double spend to localbitcoins.com following this tutorial:   Warning though: don't cheap out on the fees.  I was only able to send one replacement transaction using localbitcoins.  I'm now unable to up the fee on any site I can find.  Note: your transaction will age out of the mempool after 14 days (or sooner if it's knocked out due to mempool size).  At that point it'll be like you never broadcast it and you should be able to re send it with a more reasonable fee rate.

Or you can just wait the 14 day forced hodl.  It might be a blessing in disguise.

Yeah, that transaction has shitloads of script data in it.  Not 100% sure whats going on with all of that, but at 3024 bytes, your $150 transaction fee nets out to 326 sat/B.  This is a little under the current level for quick transactions (400+ sat/B).  It'll probably clear but not right away.  If you do a lot of transactions, you should look into why there's so much script data in these wallets.  You might be able to turn off some features to streamline your future transactions.

Do you control the private key for the destination?  If so you can also send a small amount from the destination using your stuck transaction as the input.  Then, in order to get the fee on the new transaction, the miner will also have to include your old one.  That might be safer than doing the whole $30k transaction by hand.

I'm SODL on the HODL.  Bought in high anyway, can't make money by selling.
