IRA Financial Group also sets you up in an LLC like Broad. I am just starting the process with a phone call to them today. Don't know the fees yet, but I think the annual is around $180. What I don't know is if the exchanges will even let you open an account as an LLC. I have questions out to Binance and Poloniex, but them actually saying more than read the FAQ is a long shot. I know Coinbase works, but who wants that :)

Can you define what the following means in your contracts: "Otherwise, this Agreement may only be terminated by either party for good cause (aus wichtigem Grund). What is good cause?

How do I "experience" mining with a cloud contract? Its just money in and coins back. There is no experience. There are no actions to be taken. Secondly, please illustrate a time, any time, when for some people it was more profitable to buy a contract than the coins outright? You mentioned it, now follow up with an example that includes specific details. Gambling assumes risk and reward, not just risk. Please detail an example of someone winning. And don't use USD in that explanation, just use coins in your explanation. Thanks!

Can you please define the return policies so that we don't abuse them? Your contracts talk about cancelling for good cause and describe a refund process. Can you explain how that works?

Can you explain what country's courts would throw them out? Its strange that you guys use German verbage in your contracts but are a Bermuda based company. How does that work? Can you also explain what you mean by vetted? I went to those links on your sites and they are just articles. I never saw any statements from any of those organizations endorsing your business. Do you have the month and year of the consumer report review?

Why shouldn't we compare it to all options. We should always consider the utility cost of making an investment. Cloud mining is a passive investment (and has been defined as such by the IRS), meaning you can't do better or worse through any skill in the tasks of mining. You just sit and receive the revenue. As such it should always be compared to other ways of investing that same money. If it always makes less than another form of investment (buying the coins direct) then what value do these contracts add to the universe?

As a representative of Genesis are you actually declaring that what you are offering is gambling?
