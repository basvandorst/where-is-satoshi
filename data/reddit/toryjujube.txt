I'm not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin but I'm just going to go with it.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:37:14
And the bank demonstrates why you wanted that bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:40:00
I keep an eye on this sort of thing and always mine on an underdog pool.

The interest rate being set to 0% is still very inflationary.

Welcome back!

Players can indeed trade linden dollars between each other, and quite a bit of it.  There is also some options to cash out.  There are those who make their real-life living in SL.   I used to know such a person.
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:40:05
You are well connected.
@_date: 2014-09-19 16:49:16
And then you just make a brand new wallet which is easy to do.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:58:23
It says they accept bitcoin right on the front page.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:42:18
So the reason Bitcoin won't be valuable is because it's so valuable.
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:42:46
Shiny gold and silver.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:18:41
I feel so conflicted...
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:07:44
If you care and want to do something about it, then buy an Asic miner block erupter usb for like 40$ 
And then mine on an underdog pool.  Cheap and easy.

This is so funny, the memes are glorious!  Can we just adopt him as our Satoshi anyways?
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:44:10
Have you practiced with a small amount of bitcoin?  Reading is fine, but it helps to play around with it.  Find a wallet and security solution you like.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:19:36
Wow this is big.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:18:11
Gold and silver are great things to buy.
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:24:20
I believed Bitcoin was cool when it was 2$, so why wouldn't I believe it is cool at ~245?
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:47:49
It is indeed happening.  The happenings.
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:58:01
That's one of my criteria for bitcoin's success: if I can see them being sold in the 7-11 near me.

Ask yourself why the split happened in the first place.
@_date: 2016-11-14 05:04:49
Sadly it may not make it anytime soon due to ViaBTC mining unlimited at 10%
@_date: 2016-11-14 05:08:41
ViaBTC is mining unlimited at 10% .  Segwit won't activate as long as this is true.  
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:12:41
Silver is also down over 3% today.

There's your problem.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:45:26
Sticky all the things!
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:01:26
I wouldn't answer it.  If it was serious, they would send you snail mail, or a person would visit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:07:36
Too boring to talk about the low fees...
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:06:55
Is this a real story?
@_date: 2016-02-27 06:59:37
I would argue against you but this whole post will probably get censored anyway.  Just think about which subreddit censors.
@_date: 2016-02-27 07:52:35
Oh really now? Look above. I see [removed]

Near the end of this year, the amount of bitcoins generated per block will suddenly be cut in half.  You don't think that will have any effect on the price?  Think supply and demand.
@_date: 2012-01-25 20:36:01
Um, you can back up your wallet you know.
@_date: 2012-05-11 00:50:33
You should keep it in your wallet and admire it every now and then.

Shiny shiny bitcoins!  *gets blinged out*
@_date: 2012-06-25 18:28:44
No, of course not.
@_date: 2012-06-02 22:27:19
Yes, the market never sleeps.
@_date: 2012-06-19 17:32:48
Well this is in the works:
@_date: 2012-01-17 18:21:31
Very much agreed.  Bitcoin is a powerful tool to fight things like Sopa (which includes financial blocking) and it should stay open.
@_date: 2012-05-04 08:50:10
No it's happening at the end of this year.  The first bend in that graph happens around the start of 2013, where the 50 block reward becomes 25.
@_date: 2012-01-16 21:28:58
If your goal is to receive a small amount of bitcoins, it works perfectly fine.  Try it out by sending some coins to an instawallet.  
@_date: 2012-11-28 15:35:16
@_date: 2012-07-23 20:58:03
Actually if you grab Inkscape and open up the .svg file, it's really easy to do.
@_date: 2012-05-24 20:08:26
Here is a cool way to do it:
Get them an actual coin!  There is a silver 10 BTC coin too, so the silver has real value as well.

Did you know that terrorists sometimes drive in cars?
@_date: 2011-09-13 03:06:11
I would do it.
@_date: 2011-12-19 20:12:36
If the sticker seems loose and about to fall off, just peel it off and redeem the bitcoin value.  
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:57:26

Looks like 0.22953%   I guess this will be a monthly thing?

I've subscribed to this subreddit when there was only 200 people, but now that it's being censored I am no longer subscribed.

Dragon's Tale is made by the same guy who made A Tale in the Desert, a game which I played a lot.  His name is Andrew Tepper and I've met him in person.  Pretty nice guy.

Instawallet is pretty neat but yea, only use it for tiny amounts.
@_date: 2011-09-11 01:01:51
I still think bitcoin has a bright future.

Stop using Windows.  I would never trust my bitcoins on a windows machine.  (I use Linux.)

Well I've initiated a Dwolla transfer so the price is sure to shoot right up! ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:27:25
Relax, stay calm, and take a deep breath.  Remember the fundamentals, remember why you are here.  Bitcoin is about having freedom over your money and freedom for markets.  I'm not selling, and I look forward to getting a nice deal on some coins.

As an aside, that alpaca socks seller...pure genius.  Everyone knows about alpaca socks, and they are probably a bitcoin millionaire.

Everytime the government acts against bitcoin it just makes me mad and want to buy more.

7 billion people, 21 million bitcoins, congrats now you are ahead of the game.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:37:55
Yes except coinbase really sucks right now.   I've been waiting over a week for one transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:44:21
For Chrome please make sure you harden up its security, you should be using https everywhere  ghostery  go to advanced settings/privacy/content settings and turn off 'javascript', also go to chrome://plugins/ and turn off plugins you dont need, turn off Java! thats a big security hole.  
I love bitcoin but when you 'be your own bank' it is serious business, personally i would never access my bitcoins using a windows 7 machine, I use Linux.   
Hope that helps.
Edit: I also forgot "adblock" another good plugin, and also in settings select "click to play" for plugins.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:54:38
You are really not making any sense now.  "If taxes were voluntary I wouldn't pay them, because it would mean they were not necessary"  The fact that the government points a gun at you is the reason you deem taxes necessary, as per your quote there.  You can't have it both ways.  In your current country, you've analyzed the situatation and judge that those taxes are worth paying.  So would you pay them voluntarily?
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:37:06
I use Electrum.  It's great.

This is the third bubble I've ridden through and it's completely routine.  Indeed, see you at the next bubble.

Yes, you can send money to it and even check the balance via blockchain (or the like) without ever touching the paper.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:59:53
Bitcoin will be made easier with hardware wallets like the Trezor or the others that are sure to spring up.
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:00:14
Do what you want to do with bitcoin.  It's supposed to be a useful tool for you.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:34:13
Whatever you choose to do, please test it out with a small amount of bitcoin first.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:58:30

But if I spend some bitcoins and buy a car, then I cut the bankers out of that transaction.

I believe it has its own internal DNS.  It is bootstrapping itself off of today's internet, but in theory someday you wont need a traditional isp at all.  Local meshnets can exist connected wirelessly or by other means, perhaps using the internet as a backbone between one local meshnet and another.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:37:16
I still love bitcoin, and I'm still here.
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:41:55
Instead of cashing out just buy a bunch of gold.

@_date: 2013-03-20 19:26:27
Well I think it makes you a hypocrite, telling other people to do something that you are not willing to do yourself, except when the government points a gun at you to do it.  Also I disagree with your assertion that involuntary means necessary.  Food is necessary for you but you get food through voluntary transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:30:55
People always talk about how bitcoin needs to be dumbed down so that the average joe can use it, and that's fine.  It's good to have nice, clear easy interfaces to things.  But it's also good to see people smartening up a little as well.
@_date: 2013-08-08 21:20:33
Ok article, you can't have it both ways, either Bitcoin is worthless or it might enter a "deflationary spiral".
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:17:16
When in doubt, back up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:33:43

'"Cash out" is misused. Those of us who understand this most have "cashed out" of the US Dollar.'
love this quote.

Oh that USD is so unstable, how can anyone use it as a currency?
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:38:23
And yet you voted with your feet from your original country, were those taxes not necessary?  Isn't using bitcoin another way of voting with your feet?

You can try 
IRC, web of trust based system, payment methods vary, some of which might require ID but the exchange itself doesn't.
@_date: 2013-09-08 21:24:49
Look at their ratings, stick with higher rated people to stay safe.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:25:10
This is pretty nice but could it output the public address as well?
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:06:24
If you wrote a funded private key on the cake it could be worth actual bitcoins as well.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:20:12
!!If paying taxes was fully voluntary, would you still pay them?
!No. In fact, I migrated because I didn't like the taxation in my original &gt;country.
Wait what? After that speech above, you just admitted you wouldn't pay taxes if you didn't have to.  Perhaps this is the freedom bitcoin gives you.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:43:10
The best solution is to join a credit union.  I've been happily buying bitcoins with Coinbase from my credit union without any problems.
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:45:51
Trezor is one of the most important things bitcoin needs to become truely successful, and will make it safe for a non technical person to hold and use bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:51:50
I'd be happy if bitcoin can take 1-3% of the global money market.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:33:54
This is actually very important.  I hope we can get a definitive answer on this.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:12:49
How is this even possible?

It's never too late to buy a little bit of coin from time to time.  If you believe that the USD is going into the toilet and that BTC will rise over the years, then it could be a way to preserve some of your wealth.

I wonder if that covers those selling casascius coins.  Quite a few of them being sold on Ebay.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:55:53
No panic here.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:50:28
Other people have already said it, but that thing you are tired of is the existing banking system, because that is what is making it harder to buy coins.

Wow I like this.  And yes, if you use it, be sure to download the site and run it on a secure laptop disconnected from networks.

I would love to join something like this.

I up voted because the idea itself is cool, and if that particular price is too high I'm sure a competitor will be delighted to under cut it.

I've seen casascius coins being sold on ebay.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:30:01
These sorts of arguments drive me nuts:  Bitcoin is so valuable that people will hoard it and not spend it, and thus Bitcoin is worthless.  Um so, Bitcoin is so valuable that it's worthless.   Really now...
@_date: 2013-05-27 04:26:47
It's not a coin at all.
