right now it is 20% arbitrage for Japanese. That is nice. If you manage to make 10 rounds you can have 6 times your money. (1000*1,2^10)

Everybody who is sick of inflation, stupidly high banking fees, giving reason to withdraw my own money and so on and on, should and probably is holding some bitcoin.

It takes balls to give back $100K. Good decision.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but more monitors does not mean more profit. 90% to 95% of daytraders are losing money.

Ha ha there are people paying hundreds of $M USD for shitty drawing, so it is possible that someone will buy it, but not likely, definitely not here.

Seriously? Who is still there?
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:27:34
that is why he should have sold those 5000 coins at around 1000 USD where he would have had 5M USD for 100%, now it is a painfully costly lesson.

Bitcoin client on your computer can be easily wiped out too. If something for sure - paper wallet with BIP32 generated on a live CD. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:09:04
Lucky bastard :-) Step one - secure your BTC as good as you can. Step two  - forget about them for 3 to 5 years and do as nothing happened. If you are lucky enough, you can buy car, house and have some leftover in few years. Better than some crappy car now is not it?

I guess you still have chance to use  to get 38% of that 80 BTC which sucks but better than nothing

Should be those 1M accounts including me worry about identity theft? Whole database is leaked and so do all those documents...

Ideally you will not have to convert to anything. That will take some time, but we will get there.

People like you should not be investing at all. Give the rest of the money to your sister. She will probably forgive you that $100K you OWE her on top of that 280K. Find a job and never touch anything which moves in value again. (no mortgage or leasing for you either).
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:31:39
What is surprising for me is. Why an early adopter and well known member of the community was so STUPID to keep his BTC on some exchange IOU especially Mt.GOX?? Early adopter should know that there exists paper wallets where you have 99.9999% chance that you do not lose your BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:46:34
Just a matter of time. Only massive bug in the protocol or vastly superior cryptocurrency will beat bitcoin (Or total ban from most of the countries). 
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:16:27
For every problem there is a solution. Good job OP!
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:51:09
There is allways a chance. You could be killed with a flying elephant in a pink underpants from another exoplanet right now. Only the probability is looow. I quess one person in 1M believed that BTC will go from 1$ to 1000$. 
But post is about more important things

wow, hard to be Brazilian I guess then

it is predictable. Buy and hodl
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:04:22
If you think that it will be really a success how much do you need 10 BTC? So keep those 10 BTC and sell others (so you do not lose more in case it fails)
@_date: 2014-02-01 10:18:58

Doing good better cca 50 BTC for 100% than some potential trading gains for who knows what probability. Actually 90-95 % of daytraders lose money.

With 4:1 odds you need to be successful at least in 20% of similiar decisions to be break even on your investments in the long term. As I see it is more like 50% chance that you will eventually not lose the money invested, and you can afford to lose that 1K without any major damage, therefore it is a wise decision.
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:43:38
Definitely great idea
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:49:36
If you eat well and maybe little bit of exercise you can get to 4 hours sleep without major problem caused to you. Most of executives sleep less than 6 hours a day. You do not need drugs - good food and exercise is much better. What you need is less drugs (alcohol, tobacco, coffee). I sleep around 6 hours a day and doing great. But you have to go down gradually by few minutes each day to be able to sustain

That was literally first thing coming to my mind when blockchain.info sended copy to my e-mail account, that it will be easily exploitable for attacker. Why they do that without asking you first?? Sorry for your loss.

ATMs availability for BTC will be very crucial about masses bitcoin adoptance. If you buy with cash, no hassle from your bank how you use your money and everybody is familiar with using ATM.

There is this thing called black swan. The creators have to be 150 % sure that it will work or if something is wrong they will become Karpeles 2 and Karpeles 3 hated by everyone and probably repel others to enter bitcoin movement.

AAAnnd Mt.Gox is solvent again buying all those bitcoins at $90-$100. Makes me puke.

If you studied it more thoroughly all 50K BTC trades were made 4829.37 and 4829.38 (not precise numbers but 0.01 difference in price is right). So either BTCchina faked it, or someone tried to make impression that volume goes up or who knows - but it was faked
@_date: 2014-02-02 08:38:43
What everyone is usually afraid that his loved one will find out. Tell him that you know everything about him and that you will reveal that what he is doing to his friends, family, reddit. Tell him that you will create him a website  create one (themeforest.net for 50$) and reveal all his info there.

when BTC gets over 1000$ and actually stays there for a while (month) people will switch to mBTC. It is much better and everyone understands that something cost 500 mBTC = circa 500 USD

Even though I practically hate Fontas - here is one quote from him which I definitely agree with - The tip to become a successful trader is to trade successfully. And to do that you buy high sell low for long enough to learn how to do the opposite

Ok why would anyone put his BTC into others hand for 3.65% interest a year when you can (in this case definitely will) get your BTC stolen. Moreover BTC is easily moving around 10-20% a week.
All in all if somebody sent there his money he deserves to lose them for being dumber than 6 years old
