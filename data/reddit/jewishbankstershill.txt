If you have 50% + 1, you can take control of the network by not immediately publishing discovered blocks. Since you control most of the hashpower in the network, you're guaranteed to have the longest blockchain, so the network will prefer your blocks over competing groups'

No they don't... read up on what a 50% + 1 attack is and how it works.

I kind of see what you mean, although I don't agree. In the long-term, if they have 50% + 1, they're guaranteed to mine 100% of blocks that make it to the blockchain.
If self-interested miners found out that GHash wanted to take advantage of their dominance to stage a 50% + 1 attack, some might join them out of the interest of making more money, network be damned.
Maybe that isn't a viable strategy--I never claimed it was--but it is a possibility.

Tragedy of the Commons.
If GHash.io made a move that let the miners make more money, I bet *more* miners would start mining with them.

You're calling a 2 year old account that pays for Reddit Gold, trollbait?

it's the difference between 50% of blocks mined and 100% of blocks mined.
Transaction fees are irrelevant compared to the block reward.

If you're asking questions like this, maybe you should re-evaluate whether you're competent to co-found a "Bitcoin startup," whatever that means.

Filthy fascist statist.

The free market has decided.
It's decided it loves GHash.io

No. With 50% + 1 they're mathematically guaranteed in the long-term.
