This is true for me and I'm sure there's some level of padding going on but for some the DDos is a major factor.
I was running a full classic node at home but was DDos on multiple occasions causing outages for me.
So if I want to run a classic node my choices are not good.  I opted to run a pruned node on a cloud instance I had.
But if I want to actually spend some of my bitcoin then I'll need to either move my wallet off my home network, switch my home client back to core, or run my classic client over tor or something.  Not optimal.

Oh okay.  I was up front in customer service / returns.  There was a big moneygram sign hanging down from the ceiling near the counter.  Thought I was in the right spot.

Last year, I added Bitcoin support to my humble open source personal finance manager here:  
 
It can import transactions from the bitcoin.org client and does some of the things you list.

Tried the Walmart route with $40 just to see how it worked.  
After filling out the form on bitinstant, I was taken to onother vendor site that produced the printout.  All pretty straight forward.  
Printed it and off to Wallmart I went.  I handed the cashier my printout and she had no idea what to do with it so she grabbed her manager who was also clueless.  At some point a third cashier had come over and they were passing the printout amongst themselves squinting at it.  The asked me to explain what it was and if they needed to give me the $40 and I tried my best to explain what I thought should happend but it was my first time so...well...enough said.   During this time the line had gotten fairly long and impatient.  Was quite a scene.
They finally told me to come back during daytime hours and ask for Sue who's apparently the sole knowlege keeper of these sorts of transactions.
I'll try my printout on Sue tommorrow and see how it goes.
