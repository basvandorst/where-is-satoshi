Imagine if one day Bitcoin would be so mainstream that they would have this t-shirt available in H&amp;M stores.

It's not your fault.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:40:39
Same here.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:41:47
You would need to verify your bank account anyway if you ever plan to cash out so better do it now.

Did you buy the bitcoin in February 2012? You cheapskate.

I don't want to sound mean but if you had typed the keywords in your question into the search bar then you would have found many discussions with answers.

Think of it this way - you are putting money into bitcoin like you would put money into your savings account. Only difference is that you cannot easily splash it on useless things (what might happen when you can access your account through a debit/credit card) and the interest rates are much better compared to a bank (riskier yes but big risk, big reward:)

Funny to think that the guy who bought the 10k pizzas could have bought 1000 Porsches.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:51:55
In a way yes - one option you are buying bitcoin with your card and the other option you are transferring money TO your account not buying any currency. When the money is in your Coinbase wallet then you can transfer it to GDAX without fees and set-up a limit buy. You can set the price to what you are willing to pay for it and then when it hits you will get the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:32:48
If you want to buy instantly then coinbase is the way to go. They charge about 3% fee when you buy with debit/credit card. You can sell in coinbase as well but they take a similar fee. Smart thing to do is to deposit money to Coinbase account (just pay the european bank transfer fee)with a bank transfer and then transfer the money to  GDAX which is owned by coinbase.
Transferring funds from coinbase to GDAX is free. There you can set a limit buy which is also without fees. There are many tutorials about this in youtube, check them out before doing it.

No problem. And remember to just keep HODLing!

Let's compare the two options 
1)Pay by debit/credit card in coinbase &gt; Pay 3% fee &gt; Receive bitcoin 
2)Transfer € to coinbase account &gt; bank transfer fee (0.38€) &gt; Wait 1-2 days &gt; Money appears on bitcoin &gt; transfer to GDAX without a fee &gt; set up limit-buy &gt; Wait for it to fill&gt;Receive bitcoin &gt; transfer back to coinbase without a fee
To sum it all up it takes more time and more steps but you CAN AVOID ALL the fees except the initial bank transfer fee (~1€)

If you go to coinbase and add your bank account as a new payment method it asks you to transfer a small amount to verify the account. You wouldn't want 1000€ going missing if you accidentally put the wrong reference number would you? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:44:00
5+ for the name lol

@_date: 2017-11-05 11:39:53
It depends - do you want the bitcoin now or you have few days to spare? If you pay the coinbase fee you will have the bitcoin immediately on your account. The other option - verifying your bank account, takes about 2 days - you need to add a bank account, transfer a small sum to coinbase account with the correct reference number and once it gets verified then transfer the 1000€ which will take another day or two.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:48:13
There is a step-by-step tutorial on Coinbase regarding on how to do it. Transfer like 5€ to verify your account. When it gets verified the 5€ will also be added to your Coinbase € wallet. After that transfer the 1000€. When it arrives log in to GDAX - you don't even need to register an account as its tied to Coinbase, hit deposit and choose your coinbase euro wallet. Then check the prices and set up a limit buy and wait until it gets filled. After that you can transfer it to a wallet of your choice or back to Coinbase.

So if my day trading profits are ~$17 per day and i put that money into bitcoin daily I will have 1 btc by September 2019?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:31:18
Your phone doesn't actually have the bitcoin on it, it is stored in the blockchain. Same way like your bank card doesn't actually hold the money.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:43:34
You only pay for the bank transfer and as you are in the European Union that should cost less than an euro (you are transferring to LHV bank which is located in Estonia).
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:48:12
I know thats why I gave you 5+:)

Don't be lazy and do your own research!

Vertcoin did a 50%+ rise today might want to monitor that.

Exchanges need your IDs and if the they don't match you cannot buy.

So how much did you invest in to make 1m through the years?

A double warning when you have been up for days and are transferring coins while driving a vehicle.

Hi, im the lawyer to deceased late Prince of Zamunda and have just received his 15000 bitcoins which his evil halfbrother who murdered him is after. I need to transfer these to a safe account and i have chosen you because of your excellent credit report. To make it worth your while you can keep half of these bitcoin when returning me the currency. All you need to do is run this .exe file and it sends me the correct addresses. Many thanks to you my frieeeend and may your bitcoin reach the moooon.

Bitcoin o plomo?
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:22:16
My bad. So it took 7 years to get to 100 billion, probably 2-3 more years and we are there?
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:14:45
Google is your friend! Learn what bitcoin is, how blockchain works. Watch few documentaries, read more and if you have some money you are willing to invest/lose then open an account in Coinbase(very newcomer friendly exchange) and buy some coins!
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:38:52
What time did you sell and what time did you hodl? What was your strategy? Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:33:35
If you are a newcomer then Coinbase - very user friendly and easy. If you are in for the long haul then it is advised you move bitcoin from an exchange to your wallet.

Try taking the picture in better light/quality, happened to me as well when trying to verify with the webcam. Took the pictures with my phone and worked like a charm. All of the exchanges require at least one ID, if you want to increase your transfer/card limits you need additional IDs - no way around it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:18:47
How do you tackle the safety issue? I would be so paranoid owning that much coin. Have you told family/gf/friends etc?
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:47:45
Didn't we pass that already last friday (for a brief moment)?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:42:25
You can transfer from your wallet straight to an exchange.

Bitcoin is like the original coca cola - all other cherry coke's and pepsis come and go but nothing beats the original in value.
