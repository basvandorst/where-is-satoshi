Yeah, but everything except drugs is sold on Amazon for cheaper :I

I'd guess they did it the way you'd expect from a movie that shows Ulbricht in a positive light.

Yeah dude we are off-topic. I was talking about why Bitcoin offers bad guys an easy method for doing transactions without law enforcement/intelligence being able to follow them. 
Then you said the bad guy threat is probably mostly a manufactured excuse to oppress and control people.

Well then, as a parting gift, I present you with this leaked FBI report on Bitcoin.

Well, hackers &amp; co. aren't exactly known for their English skills. Exhibit A: those "Anonymous" press releases. Just terrible.

That's just not how terrorism works. After a lot of people die and a video pops up on Youtube announcing "yes, we are the ones who bombed the girls' school! Fear us!" you really don't need to pull banking records to prove they exist. Furthermore, I don't think you could prove the existence of a new terrorist group based solely on financial transactions. Even if you see someone bought a metric fuckton of C4, that could be a terrorist group you already know of.
So when you say "accused of being terrorists", who are you even talking about? Terrorist groups are generally happy to take credit for their handiwork. Drawing attention to themselves is why they do it in the first place. They want you to fear them.


Care to name any specific examples?!

Bitcoin is a terrorist's dream. Of course they're interested in it.

Well, that kind of information is kept highly classified. No one besides a bunch of government analyst types is ever going to see it.  So unless you only want to fool other people with high-level clearances, trying to invent a terrorist group based on collected financial data is just a terrible way to do it. I don't think I've heard of anyone making up a terrorist group, anyway.
When I said terrorist boss, I just meant someone high-up enough in the pecking order to manage the group's finances.

Is it just me or are all of these completely interchangeable?

Yeah. One of the most effective ways to track a terrorist organization's activity is by its financial transactions. So, if you are a smart terrorist boss you should be using something very anonymous and hard to trace. I would hardly call it ingenious.
