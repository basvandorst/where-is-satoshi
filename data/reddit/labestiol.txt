You need a way to protect the value of the currency, otherwise you will get abused (google 51% attack). 
The value of the currency provides incentive for miners to protect it.

"For several decades, electronic money has been an illusion chased by all those who believed in the possibility of creating a tool that can produce momentous upheavals in the field of economics and finance. We could have arrived at the initial phase of this monetary revolution, but the consequences of use on a global scale may be particularly dangerous."
@_date: 2012-08-16 18:41:02
Can you provide some evidence of that ?

Now, let's say I have a hundred million dollars. Should I invest 1% of it in a promising low risk/reward small-cap fund, despite high volatility ? *hell yes*
btw these kind of investors are probably already starting to accumulate. Slowly and stealthily to be sure they get a good price, but surely.

Unfortunately not. 
If you're not familiar with it, it used to be, was called bitcoinica, and went bankrupt after a series of hacks. So the bitcoin world is quite frisky about leverage platform since. 
Right know we either have ICBIT, where liquidity is indeed poor, and Bitfinex, an improved clone of bitcoinica that I can't vouch for.
Still don't get why some serious/renowned people are not launching something, but it should come eventually.

No need to harass them. Funny thing is it must happen often enough that they now have a pre-written answer. Iirc, another redditor got the same answer a week or two ago.

Armory developper also though about this solution, but didn't implement it yet.

Same here. 
Seeing people loose confidence over exchanges hacks was mindblowing. People just wouldn't understand that bitcoin was still safe. 
I discovered bitcoin just after the top, bought my first bitcoins around 15$. The more I was reading about it, the more I was buying... at lower prices. Nice memories :)
EDIT : I also remember at the worst point being down like 70%, and still buying. Friends/Family looking at me, worried. Quite challenging psychologically
