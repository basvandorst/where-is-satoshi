I don't know, maybe *because* he stole their coins? Lol... I think what you really mean to ask is: why were people dumb enough to trust him in the first place? 
Some people fell into the trap, in fact many did (which is why he was around for so long), but **many** of us also knew he was a shady character. Cryptocurriencies attract shadiness because of the inherent anonymity but there are certain things that can't be anonymized (such as the trademark claim, as I have already mentioned). I personally never went anywhere close to Moolah's services because I didn't trust him. Don't be ignorant enough to generalize an entire community when you clearly aren't a member thereof.
In fact the *only* reason why *anyone* did business with Moolah was because he basically had a monopoly on the Dogecoin community (similar to the way Coinbase basically ran Bitcoin until Circle arrived). Now other options exist, and this is, I believe, part of the reason why his empire has fallen.

@_date: 2014-08-26 14:15:23
No but seriously, how?
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:40:53


This is my use case. However, in my case affecting the outcome would be a significant risk, so I would have to hide my predictions and only reveal them after the event but prove I made them before the event.  
Right now I'm planning on using the Proof of Existence site to generate the proof and then once the event occurs, I would release the document itself (and the proof of existence would verify its legitimacy and timestamp). 
@_date: 2014-08-05 09:41:36

This isn't complicated. It's not "-5 to +5", you are talking about **multiple transactions**.

Are you new here? Do you even know how BitPay works?
It's common knowledge that about **half of all BitPay merchants** actually receive some of the bitcoins sent to them (i.e. they don't do a full cashout to USD), and a significant portion of those receive the **entire payment** in Bitcoin.

2. Use shapeshift.io to exchange the $10 worth of dogecoins for $10 worth of BTC
3. Send BTC to your address

Ummm...what? Lol
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:13:36
On the payment: do you know what level of payment they are expecting? Obviously I intend to "send money" via the blockchain in order to create a transaction to prove the existence, but I didn't know they would be looking for a fee of some sort. If that's the case, I'll have to investigate my own solution, like using/adapting their source code (which I have the ability to do).  
On the predictions: I'm going to be making predictions about how other people (not mysef) make decisions. As in, person X has a decision to make, and I think I can guess, with a reasonable level of accuracy, what that decision will be. I can know my prediction (obviously I would have to), as I personally don't affect the outcome (it's not my decision after all), but if my prediction is known publicly, it can encourage the person to change their decision (intentionally or not).  
At some level, I could theoretically influence the decisions myself (such as: to increase my accuracy), but that is not something I could realistically accomplish. As an example, say you create a band and you want Lebron James to listen to your music. There are some ways you could attempt to influence him to do this, but realistically the decision would be out of your hands.  
If you want to know the *exact* topic I'm predicting, send me a PM. It's not something I'm ready to reveal publicly yet, but I don't mind telling a couple people. However, it's probably not something that would interest you.

@_date: 2015-04-07 06:43:01
No, it does not work like a charm. You do not understand the technology you are dealing with here.  
The public streaming API contains an EXTREME minority of all tweets actually made. You are running a gambling site using (at worst) only ONE PERCENT of all tweets actually being made. Can you honestly say that this is a fair gambling site if the outcomes are determined by only 1% of the full data? Any bet that comes even remotely close to breaking even could be completely false.  
BETwitter is not a fair gambling site. It does not actually measure "all the tweets".   
See this for more details:  (found [here]( )  
Most bitcoin gambling sites claim they are "provably fair". Your site is the exact opposite -- provably **unfair**.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:11:04
Well I have the means to create something like this but obviously I can't just open a Python script and write:

What kinds of data trails need to be established, and what metrics determine when theft has occurred? How do you correlate identities to addresses? How do you identify when someone owns both accounts involved in a transaction? These kinds of questions must be answered before any kind of visualizations are designed.  
Why don't you suggest this idea to blockchain.info? They might have the intuition necessary to develop these kinds of analytics.

It's not because it's overkill, that was a completely ridiculous response to your question by someone who obviously doesn't understand the situation. It's a security risk.  
Think of a full node like a bus station. People (transactions) queue up, and get collected into a bus (block), which then travels elsewhere, to spread (broadcast) the people (transactions).  
If you owned a bus station, you wouldn't keep your money stored there. Sure, you could lock it up and pack it down with lots of tech, hidden compartments, etc, but if someone knows there is money stored there, someone could eventually study the build and figure out a way in. On the internet this is even easier than it sounds and also more likely to occur, especially in such a way that the thief can cover his tracks. What's worse than being robbed? Not having any idea who robbed you.    
What's the point anyway, when you can just store it in a place built for money security?

I tried Circle. Submitted my credit card details for verification, then ... nothing. Never heard back, and I'm still "pending verification." At this point it's been like 4 months so I'm done with that option.

No because they had a credit card option...unless I'm being trolled?
