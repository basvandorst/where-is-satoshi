I don't know this guy from a hole in the ground, but seeing as how he's renting a vacation property, it's likely he still has mortgage payments to make on it and is simply using Bitcoin to give his renters another option, rather than using Bitcoin as an alternative value-storage currency.  That would necessitate having a quick way to convert Bitcoins-to-dollars.
