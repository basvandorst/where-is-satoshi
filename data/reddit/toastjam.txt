Yes, the wealthy do their best to change the tax laws in their favor. If taxes are not progressive enough and fairly applied then they can definitely worsen wealth inequality, I agree.
But back to the discussion, how specifically do they change taxes that will affect Bitcoin differently than fiat? I'm trying to figure out why you think moving to a deflationary currency will not make wealth disparity worse over time (as compared to an inflationary currency).

Citation please -- seems to me like capitalism would be the largest source of wealth inequality.


Not sure I'd agree with your assumption here.
The counterargument can summed up as simply as, "takes money to make money".
Thus those with the most money will be able to acquire proportionately more. As there is a finite amount, eventually they will have almost all of it.

Ok, say I own a factory. What would be different about selling the widgets I make for bitcoin vs USD? As I scale my operation and make more net profit, my own personal spending grows much more slowly. I keep accumulating bitcoin at an increasingly faster rate than thousands of these low net worth individuals you mention put together. Except now the government has a lot less leverage on me as they don't control the currency, so the options for progressive taxation (the only real solution) are more limited. What am I overlooking here?
And this is sort of orthogonal to the inflationary/deflationary discussion, but automation is going to accelerate this process quite a bit.

If you're only comparing two distinct points what you're saying makes sense. If you want to look at a trend you need log scale though, so that the slope is interpretable as the rate of increase.

I didn't overlook it. I even mentioned taxes to point out crypto would make it easier to avoid them (but for the sake of argument we can assume people keep paying all necessary taxes). I also stated we need progressive taxes to fight extreme wealth concentrations.
Anyway, taxes are not stopping rising wealth inequality now, why would they with bitcoin?

Before you said it had everything to do with taxes, now you say taxes have nothing to do with it.
All I am trying to figure out is why you think crypto won't accelerate the concentration of wealth. Please give a concrete example so I can understand
