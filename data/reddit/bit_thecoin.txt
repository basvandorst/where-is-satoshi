Why are you on the defensive?  Can't answer a simple question?  Nothing I said was rude or snarky, no reason for you to be snarky.

As I am sure you have!  Because bitcoin being banned = good for bitcoin of course!

You don't want to give them your email, but you will give them access to your entire reddit profile and all of the data associated with it?  That makes absolutely 0 sense.


I'm asking valid questions, no need to get defensive.  You're the second person in this thread to get very defensive about a simple question, what are you afraid of?

Yes you could, the balance of your reddit account could be stored internally, just like it is right now until you give them your Paypal email.  Then it could be deposited whenever you would like.  If your argument is it takes time for the funds to clear in Paypal, I would argue that does not matter because Changetip is for tips not money transfer.

What regulations?  As long as they stick to the under $25 rule they are fine.  They can accept deposits in fiat instead of bitcoin.
So how does bitcoin help this company in any way?
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:20:26
Well it actually is that simple.  Changetip is editing balances in an internal ledger.  It doesn't use bitcoin in any way shape or form.  Paypal could just as easily create this service in the exact same way and leave out bitcoin altogether, and so can changetip.
 
I am specifically asking: In what way does bitcoin help this company?

You down voted because you have no answer, but you can say whatever makes you feel better.  This post has a hell of a lot more than a single down vote FYI.

Well allowing fiat as a deposit method sure gives them a better chance at success than limiting to bitcoin.  Even if all bitcoin users used Changetip, it would be hard for them to stay in business with the low volume.  They need to expand into fiat, and I'm guessing they will - that's probably why they got their VC.  In the meantime, it seems bitcoin is totally useless for this company.  Judging by the complete lack of response and the high number of down votes, I believe that means I am on the right track of thought.
