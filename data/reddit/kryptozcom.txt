Well from saying it’s a fraud and scam to starting to trade it through their own futures contracts in 2018, I’d say he’s not believing much of what he said in the past anymore. Let’s just see how invested he gets with his company in the next couple of years. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:35:58
That still means not all. You’d be surprised how many people fall for things like this. Look at BitConnect. Many still think it’s legit. SMH.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:27:50
Some of the very best! It was so needed in this space.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:20:31
Different type of forks. You’d do well to research the differences.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:59:53
I drink plenty of liquids thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:25:31
I have a feeling it will skyrocket short term then into 2018 the next big crash will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:18:25
Agreed but that also means there will he even more dangerous attacks to come. Bitcoin will be the most attacked ecosystem the world have ever seen. Bitcoin needs all this to grow stronger imo.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:15:12
Thanks for your insight. We shall wait and see but I agree it’s going to move soon.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:47:41
I don’t think we will. We might even see a crazy run up before the launch of CME Futures.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:35
So when does it open?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:14:17
Love how he is using Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash.  I'm sorry but does anyone know where I can buy a Bitcoin Core Coin? I didn't think so...
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:38:26
Okay just haven’t heard anything in the news.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:20:44
Should exchanges do the same for Bitcoin Gold? Make it BGold?
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:25:03
The seed will be good enough to restore elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:25:28
Not in the next 5 years. I think eventually though. I believe we will see 1 trillion market cap or higher by the end of 2018-2019.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:03:52
It was edited right after I posted it! Still pretty positive though.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:16:05
Does anyone know why they open on Sunday? Seems that Monday would make more sense but I’m sure it has to do with international markets.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:50:59
Really smart idea and it will work!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:33
I don’t love bitcoin but I love Blockchain. These people are so clueless.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:04:32
Good point.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:36:09
So he told people he’s Satoshi and is caught in a lie and still speaks for bitcoin? How is this possible?
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:00:01
From what I’ve read so far is that hashgraph is centralized and most likely will be very good on private networks. It is not open source and you need a license to build applications on the protocol at present. I think as an open ledger it will not be as safe as Bitcoin. Any others thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:19:54
Isn’t it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:17:01
I agree so you think it’s just consolidating before the next big move up or down?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:17:56
Really, what about fruit loops? Top 3?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:04:09
Won’t be small for very long...
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:19:42
Remember pet rocks?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:52:02
The time is now. Start with a little then read and watch videos learning more about this amazing technology and revolutionary invention called Bitcoin. Get more if you truly believe this is the answer to free us from the chains of centralized governments and banks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:27:01
Seems legit. The username checks out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:49:53
I agree a lot on Hashgraph but it’s great that Mike is opening up many of his gold and silver customers to really look into bitcoin and other technologies. It’s a huge win. Does anyone know the big downsides with hashgraph? Is it quite centralized or no?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:04:36
We will see over $30,000 by the end of the 2018 year.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:14:06
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:11:20
That will be a landslide of epic proportions! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:44:40
What exactly are you doing for the ecosystem?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:07:37
Why flock and not herd?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:07:04
I just edited the post.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:56:57
“I’m HODLING through to the other side” of 2020 or beyond.
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:51:16
Yeah what’s with your logo? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:26:39
Awesome Idea!
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:58:29
Yes I did. Sorry won't be posting it anymore. Cheers.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:47:18
Thank you very much. We are excited for an amazing promotion!

We will be at ELEVATED Beer Wine &amp; Spirits tonight at 6pm. Come on by and ask for Bryan Davidson. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:21:45
Sad state of affairs for Canada.
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:04:30
Feel free to post any questions you may have. Cheers.

@_date: 2014-06-03 16:54:24
It is for USA and Canada only sorry but we will have other cool stuff coming for others around the world.  Stay tuned...
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:00:30
I can’t see why not! Nothing is certain with markets but everything I’m seeing right before the CME Futures launch is looking crazy bullish. You’d have to be crazy to short BTC and think Wall Street knows this...for now.
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:02:03
Not really sure what's going on in Calgary but think the plan is to have over a 100 in Canada by year end! Canada has so many great start ups happening all over.
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:29:02
Full details on the tour cities &amp; dates can be found at 
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:06:14
Both I believe.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:10:38
I can't wait!
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:39:20
We hope to bring massive awareness to the public with this North American Bitcoin Initiative.  Hope to see you all out at one of the locations.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:24:58
-Vancouver, British Columbia Canada was the first Bitcoin ATM Machine in the world.
- Edmonton, Alberta Canada will have the most Bitcoin ATM machines in one city very soon.
Canada sure it exploding with Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-06-03 01:25:59
At this point if there is a really good location and sponsor we can add another leg on the tour or fit the city in if possible.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:42:57
UPDATE: The stop is at the University of British Columbia NOT BCIT.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:03:14
It is strange because you can be into both very easily! Gold, Silver and Bitcoin for me. You would think he would accept it at the very least because many of his customers I'm sure would love to be able to buy some precious metals with their Bitcoin. Doesn't seem very smart from a business standpoint.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:36:48
Many reputable dealers you can trust with the purity. Especially with minted coins. I agree with you that you know 100% with Bitcoin as long as you control the keys and dont have it in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:19:36
I guess he does accept Bitcoin for precious metals 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:58:40
True, but many precious metal dealers accept Bitcoin now. What's stopping him?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:26:56
True but keep in mind that gold and silver were in a 10 year bull market. I still believe that precious metals will have a huge bull run in the future and it's smart to be invested in both Bitcoin and precious metals.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:05:38
Thanks for the clarification. On a side note do you not like trolls?
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:17:14
I guess he does accept Bitcoin for precious metals! 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:53:15
If two other countries accept it as legal tender before the end of 2017.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:31:52
Which location?
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:02:34
Why did they take it out or did it get stolen?
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:40:32
You seriously think it will be above $100k by the end of 2020 or that will be the new ATH?
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:49:30
Awesome buying opportunity if you’re right!
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:55:04
If it doesn’t drop are you still buying more in 2019?
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:28:56
What do you think will happen after the 2020 halving?
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:31:27
What do you think bitcoin’s value will be by the end of 2020?
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:03:11
Next Monday then?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:21:13
So you think it best to stay away from BCH? Why?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:40:57
What I don’t understand is anyone that had bitcoin before the fork would have both. Why would they want to destroy or hurt the credibility of the other unless they moved everything into one which I find hard to believe.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:39:16
Where is the biggest action?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:37:53
Has Roger lost all faith in BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:20:10
So there are no advantages to buying or keeping BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:20
I went to the BTC subreddit and that’s all I see!
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:50:48
I appreciate all your input. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:17:58
So it’s better going forward until the transaction fees are sorted out with BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:35:58
Thanks for your input 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:34:44
Was /btc taken over by BCH promoters?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:23:38
That’s a great point. So why are so many talking bad about Bitcoin now? Just to up the price of BCH? Wouldn’t it be smart to just have a few or just cash out into BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:04:37

@_date: 2017-10-12 17:48:01
I really like Peter as well. Just want him to settle down with all the negative talk on bitcoin. It gets old year after year...
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:48:56
The crazy thing is he accepts bitcoin for gold @ his company. You’d think he would talk a little nice about it when he benefits with it as a payment option!
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:27:37
Wow! Talk about blatant lying. Roger and his gang as so desperate it’s not even funny!
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:53:07
What price?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:07:24
Or playing the market?
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:58:03
What price will you sell?
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:05:04
How do you earn more bitcoin? Mining?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:56:04
3k by end of month?
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:18:53
Yes, but then why would they ban Bitcoin if they want to monitor everyone using it?
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:37:43
Our fiat money system is more real than the moon landings.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:44:38
The moon is in the earth’s atmosphere!! Trust me I was shocked when I read that scientists just discovered that... Google it!
