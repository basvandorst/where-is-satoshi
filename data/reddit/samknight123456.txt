so if i sweep the private key and transfer the BTC to my wallet, does that mean i can now throw away that private key?
If i import the private key, my wallet will generate a new address that corresponds to the private key, correct?
Also where do i find my private key on the blockchain.info app?

in which situation would i have to pay a miners fee?
if i sweep the BTC will i have to pay a miners fee?
or if import BTC do i have to pay a miners fee?
or no fee at all?

the whole purpose of NSA building a quantum computer is to hack into military and banking encryption and also encrypted communication to gain an advantage over foreign governments and Non-US citizens.
Just remember, this documents was Top secret, it was never meant to be disclosed to the public.
For example, if this documents wasn't leaked, the only people that would know a quantum computer existed would be the NSA, thus they could direct this capabilities towards whatever cause they want to.
If bitcoin is a threat to the value of the US dollar, the USG will do everything possible to undermine bitcoin.

bitcoin in my opinion is going to fail. What will succeed is the technology behind it, the ability to transfer funds without paying fees etc. And banks will find a way to do that for fiat.
Overtime BTC will become too expensive to even mine, so whats the point?
There is only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins and who even knows how many have already been lost forever.
Its best to just invest BTC to make a quick buck or two....
