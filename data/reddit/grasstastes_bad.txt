That's just typical PR for a gangsta rapper. This dude has some serious financial advisers and PR managers. He's NET worth was $150 mil when he was ordered to pay Rick Ross's (fake one, not freeway) baby momma a tiny amount of $5 mil and they filed for chapter 11 to give them the finger.

Yeah, been waiting for over a month for a corporate account. My business is accepted in all major brokerages, but getting bitcoin seems impossible through an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:44:33
Legit question from a noob... How is someone going to **trade** big with bitcoin without being able to have 1 mil in an exchange account? Taking into consideration the reality that It's pretty much impossible to have business accounts verified at exchanges at the moment due to the demand. Same process that takes months with crypto exchanges, takes days with stock brokers.

Earn what? WTF is your problem dude? View the full context of comments we are replying to. It went downhill to full blown jokes pretty much immediately. Throwing textbook insults at each others countries with a tongue on cheek. It just whoosed over your head i guess? Perhaps it's your "superior education where only the brightest minds of the world, like yourself go attend". Honestly it seems like you are the over priviledged douchebag here if anyone. But since you apparently like to go  jerking your "fortune 100" dick around, let's just say that **true devs** are selfmade and we already have our own successful companies, mr.dude.

He did it to avoid paying for damages on a lawsuit of leaking nude pics. It was a smart move and people with money do it all the time. 50 got $400 mil in assets and that was years ago.

Sucks that all that wealth doesn't really trickle down to the people, but is hoarded by the 1%, right? It will be really interesting to see your reaction when 90% of freedom��people can no longer even afford to access Reddit after the incoming Reddit packages of your midevil ISP's. Lulz
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:36:15
Umh, with a net worth of $150 million at the time, it's pretty easy to forget about 700 bitcoins that were pretty much worthless at the time he got them from the record sales. Do you honestly think, 50 cent even knew about bitcoin a year ago before this hype.

You see, early 1800's physicians would not know any better, because xray was accidentally discovered later in 1895 by mr.röntgen... You are the coal miner of my example though.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:10:22


I said "You didn't ask an early 1800's coal miner if it would be possible to one day see inside a body **without cutting in to it.*". 
How can we have a conversation when you can't even read?
And yes, your conciousness is in your brain. If you can completely restore the cerebral cortex and rest of the pink smush to it's original state somehow, then there you have it. Although you seem to think so, there is no proof that memory links completely destroy in a "freezing" process and could not be redtored by nanobots from even the slightest trace. It's highly unlikely, but not impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:07:57
Dude! You sre totally missing the point. You could pour in billions to these "tests" and nothing will come out of it. The POINT is that perhaps there is technology invented in 200 years that can easily repair all the damage and return your damaged brain to function as normal. That technology most likely comes from a totally different field of study. It could be nanobots. It could be something we can't even imagine at this point. If the brain is there, it's highly likely that it can be fixed in far future. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:05:05
Oh, thank you, although case by case basis sounds like it will take 6 months and need liquid assets in millions.

Why can't i even open an account at a "reputable exchange", let alone make trades? Could you advice on the options that i have at the moment? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:12:44
Who cares when you are going to be dead anyway? Rather have a beatiful dream than to rot away without. Religious people do it all the time. This actually has a chance, although very low, even if in 1000 years we could likely fix all sorts of brain damage. Let a dying man dream!

We are not an AML regulated financial institute. We submitted same documents as we do for broker accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:02:49
Same documents we sent when we registered our Interactive Broker account (ID's, Incorporation docs, bank statements, board of directors, recent utility bill). Really can't remember all. We are a European company, so we don't even have those AML/KYC/OFAC documents. Perhaps you guys require more? Honestly as a EU company, i would rather have the Bitstamp account anyway, which requires same documents as IB. We are just going to have to wait for them to process...
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:29:01
That sounds like it's only good for HODL and too slow and cumbersome for trading?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:15:40
LOL, if yoy knew how to do the repairing part, this issue would be solved. The entire point of this concept is that these people are out of time to wait and hope that **in the future** someone can solve the issues. You guys are like fucking early 1800s cole miners contemplating how it will always be impossible to somehow see inside a body without cutting yourself in with a butchers knife. 95 years later some röntgen dude accidentally discovers a way. The guys running out of time are betting on the röntgen dude with their last ditch effort and that is actually not as stupid as you "undergrads" geniuses might think.

I don't know man, perhaps the scientists of today can like stick a post it note to these frozen popsicle people that says "please unfreeze me, when you can fix, ok buddy"? Perhaps the future scientists can, you know, read notes. 
I find it extremely funny that you simply can't wrap your head around this concept. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:41:12
Once again you are asking "how are this and that going to do that then". We don't know. Nobody knows at the moment. In the future (not in a week) it might very well be a trivial task. You didn't ask an early 1800's coal miner if it would be possible to one day see inside a body without cutting in to it. If you did, they (much like you right now) would laugh in your face and think such talk is outright ridiculous. 95 years later, **by accident**, it was possible. These people are out of time and they are betting on a dude like mr.röntgen to come up. They most certainly are better off with that bet, than betting on you, a 1800's coal miner who can't envision a future where things beyond their wildest dreams are possible.

I've tried submitting the documents (business account) for the past 2 weeks. They don't answer support tickets and the system shows no progress on the registration process. I am in complete darkness with the registration already and it worries me. Do they have an announcement somewhere on how long the process takes in average?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:41:44
Tell that to the wood frog. You can already avoid most damage and ice formation in the "freezing" process and the people and nanobots 500 years from now can worry about rest (if they care or exist). Nothing is impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:58:15
I actually quoted your response word for word and it is in the top of my previous post. You can't read, nor use reddit apparently.
The burden of proof is not on me. All i said was that it is **not impossible** that traces of memories are left somewhere in the "brain matter" even when the "electrical impulses" shut off. With such traces it could be possible for nanobots **in the future** to restart tje "impulses" as were. Through out this "conversation" that is all i have said; it's not impossible. You on the otherhand have been adamant that it is impossible. Therefore the burden of proof is on you. Understand?
