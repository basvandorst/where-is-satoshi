We received emails after you had this problem so it appears so the mailbox appears to be working again. What reason did it give for rejections?
We are restoring the lookup of transactions ASAP! Meanwhile, you can use the longpoll at:

We're updating and compiling a new version of the Bitcoin software. Rescanning the blockchain and verify that everything is ok might take a little while. The ETA for the site to come back up is later today. Sorry about the delay and lack of communication.

We see in the logs that your account first accessed Satoshi Dice through an anonymous proxy. There were then withdraw attempts from several different IP numbers, including the ISP that appears to be your regular connection that withdraw the 2.39 amount successfully.
I'm just speculating here, but it's possible that the secret was stolen by the proxy operator if your personal URL was put in a bad web based proxy, or if you were using a VPN service/TOR and accessing your account without putting https in front of your URL.
It's possible to password protect an account and this would block withdrawals even if the personal secret URL is compromised.
