I was a victim of this scam, but I was very lucky that I only lost 0.06, while others lost as much as 2 or 3 bitcoin. This is a GAMBLING website. It is a TRANSPARENT ponzi scheme, where everyone can see. It was completely legitimate, and it was a game. For the people that laugh at us, how would you like lets say satoshidice not paying anyone back, and hearing nothing more of it. The thing with this, is that in a ponzi game if you are too late some other guy makes money off of you. Sure you still lose money like this, but I'd rather have my money go to some other investor than a scammer.

Should be an integrated escrow service for this on alibaba, some sellers might disapear with your BTC

If they successfully ruined your business without reason, you should sue them or get them back legally.

Best reason to invest in litecoin I have seen in a long time :P

AFAIK only Rand Paul is the other Candidate accepting bitcoin.
Looks like bitcoin is really gaining popularity, if a possible president supports it directly

Or how bout a spaceship that will take us to the moon? :D

If bitcoin reaches the point where 8gb is added to the blockchain every 10 minutes, I don't think anyone will be able to use it.

Yep, take a loan from someone, sell that btc on an exchange, and then buy it back when you would like to cover. Then pay the lender back...

I just got that email too. How the hell did they get my email.

Yea I keep getting 500 internal server errors, Sucks cause as soon as I needed to sell it goes offline, my luck...

This price increase is starting to scare me. Many people are buying in now which it will inevitably crash soon. The price increase is unsuitable for a real currency as a store or customer cannot take a multi digit percentage risk on buying something if the price changes so much.
Exhibit caution, and don't invest more than you can lose.

QuadrigaCX is based in vancouver and provides a large varsity of deposit and withdraw methods including gold! They withdraw interac e-transfer so if you have a Canadian bank it takes less than a day with zero fees before the money in your account. I use them personally.
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:16:10
Haven't deposited any fiat. I only earn bitcoins using various means and I only sell them, never buy. Interac withdraws are the easiest things ever. But if I ever need to purchased I will use QuadrigaCX definitely

I think so. But for the health of all cryptocurrencies you can't just have them popping up and leaving the whole time. Eventually a single winner will emerge without any of these bullshit tx fees or any other problems bitcoin has 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:51:22
The only advantage bitcoin has right now is the amount of adoption. I've always followed bitcoin but ETH is just better

Its 2017, any competent company would be using AWS (or something similar) where scaling is automatic. The server image is provided, and when there is X amount of load that needs to be handled, they add servers or take them away as needed, automatically.
