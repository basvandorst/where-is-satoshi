Because you have to buy exactly 1 whole bitcoin, right?
As usual you completely miss the point. 
21 million coin cap is an arbitrary number. 
Price per coin is therefore arbitrary as there could have been 1/10th the current price per coin at the same market cap, or 10x the current price, all with the same total amount of money at play.

At the time of writing this the price of 1 mBTC is $0.98 USD.

Even though you found this on their public github? OK....
@_date: 2016-11-02 04:25:31
Or use a modern wallet that does all this for you.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:05:11
The complaints are from people using outdated wallets that don't have dynamic fee calculations.

How do you know this?
If the rule change was "bitcoin now has 22M coins", I certainly wouldn't switch.
You would switch in this event? I doubt that.


We've never had a contentious hard fork, or a rule that changed any of the fundamental pillars of bitcoin such as the coin limit cap.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:09:32


Sure, just compare the dollar cost of mining the two different chains. It's not a direct and precise comparison, but it is a valid comparison.
If litecoin switched to bitcoin POW and then gained more hash power than bitcoin, it would not make litecoin "the real bitcoin".
Changing bitcoin's POW would not make bitcoin "the fake bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:55:44
As I said elsewhere this is a matter of semantics and not really important what we call the event.
In my opinion it makes more sense to say that the bitcoin with millions of users is the real bitcoin, not the bitcoin with 1 user that has a massive [malicious?] mining operation.
I disagree strongly that everyone will follow blindly the largest miner even if especially if that miner is making controversial changes.
I know that I wouldn't join a 22M bitcoin fork.
I also know that the 10% ethereum fork still exists to this day, months after the fork, and that fork was supposed to have consensus.
@_date: 2016-11-29 19:59:10
This makes no sense and you don't know what fungibility means.
Segwit does increase fungibility via sidechains and better mixing possiblities, but this has nothing to do with what you are talking about.
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:43:45
No. If a block contains an invalid transaction (according to my client) then the whole block and all blocks that build on it (the chain) is now invalid. Thus miners cannot change the rules, they can only reorder (or include or not include transactions).
Your client software will view the longest VALID chain as being the chain to use for consensus.
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:47:48
Just because nodes happened to mine back then doesn't change point.
I'm sorry but you're explanation of how bitcoin mining and rule setting works is just fundamentally wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:07:26


POW forks have been discussed by core devs such as Greg Maxwell in defense of a 51% attack from a malicious miner such as the one you just described.
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:19:04
That's a good point, I mean there would be two bitcoins, one 21M coin bitcoin and one 22M coin bitcoin, and you could certainly argue that the one with more hashing power is the "real" bitcoin.
Or you could argue that the real bitcoin is now smaller than the new fork of bitcoin. Well, not bigger, but has more hashing power. What if there are 20000 21M bitcoin nodes, but only 100 22M bitcoin nodes? Who is the "real" bitcoin? When is bitcoin simply under a mining attack and we have to think about changing the POW to defend it?
It's sort of a philosophical and a semantics debate isn't it? I don't think that matters as long as we both understand what will happen in this event.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:10:50
And his point is that they are wrong and 1000 GB/month is not required to maintain a healthy network.
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:15:47
Regarding point 1, nodes reject any chain that contains an *invalid* transaction, no matter how long it is.
Thus miners can't do something like create extra coins beyond the 21M cap, because nodes will reject blocks that contain extra coins.
If you can't verify this from the code yourself then perhaps consider asking a core client contributer or other expert. You could try the  channel on freenode IRC.
Miners are free to create a long chain with "invalid" transactions, or even create a very short chain with "invalid" transactions, in either case this is a hard fork and only clients that consider those transactions valid will follow that chain.
In other words, if 90% of the mining power is mining on a chain that 0.13.1 and earlier clients consider invalid, then there will be two coins: One on the 10% chains and one on the 90% chain.
***Perhaps you can use this to prove yourself wrong:***
If the longest chain wins no matter what and everyone follows it, then how can there ever be a hard fork? By your logic, everyone would always be on the longest chain (thus no fork because everyone is always in agreement).
In reality a hardfork is when we have two coins following different rules (the definition of a hardfork). This happens when one chain (smaller than the other) has 100% of transactions that some clients consider valid but other clients consider some of those transactions invalid.

That is still uploading. And helping the network. And I don't think OP said he was being the best and most helpful node ever, just that it is possible to run a node with a very low data cap.
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:32:34
Your argument kind of goes like "whichever alt coin has more hash power than bitcoin is now the default coin, everyone has to use it!" but it doesn't work that way. People can choose whichever coin they want to use.
Litecoin has very similar rules to bitcoin. If it one day had more hashpower than bitcoin, it doesn't suddenly make litecoin "the real bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:45:00
This is not how bitcoin works. Current clients would reject a chain that creates a rule like creating extra bitcoins per block, no matter how long the chain is.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:13:58
In OP he says he is using 40GB/month total bandwidth.
4.3GB of that as you say is block downloading, the other 36GB is therefore uploading.
I don't think he said he was "helping the network", he said he was running a full node, which he was.
He isn't running blocksonly mode.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:12:07
True but it is 99.99% downloads. The only thing it uploads is transactions of your own, when you send coins.

If everyone started using your method then the probability of someone taking a printer, which is easy (orders of magnitudes easier than using parachutes and ninja skills), very quickly approaches 1.
Unencrypted data over wifi to the home (or worse, office) printer, plugging into the office printer to get recent print out.
More complex and difficult cracking has occurred, and the information you are spreading will lead to a big enough carrot for printers to get tapped. Right now the incentive doesn't exist, because not enough people use your method.

1.3% is much better news than 0% predicted by many redditors who claimed sell all their tokens immediately at $0.21 each.
(Those tokens currently above $0.60 by the way.)
@_date: 2016-09-30 23:46:05
At $0 per BFX token they took 36%. At $1 per BFX token they took 0%.
At current market rate of $0.60 per BFX token they took about (1-0.60)*36% ~= 14%.
But they bought about 2.5% of tokens so far, reducing that number further.
What part is "WRONG"?
They actually took less than 14%, my 20% was very conservative to allow for the BFX price to move around.
@_date: 2016-09-15 14:26:00
Your method is fraught with security holes and you may lose your BTC.


Can't get easier and also isn't secure. If someone gets access to your printer (and therefore its memory), they now can access your BTC. If anyone you know knows this (say, anyone who knows this is your reddit account), they know how to get access to your BTC.
Printer ink also typically doesn't last for many years in a variety of conditions (changing temperature/humidity for example), unless you use special paper and special ink.
You're also trusting bitaddress entropy which may not be good, leaving you with weak private keys.
It's also easy to lose paper wallets. There are numerous threads on this subreddit about users losing their paper wallet money. Whether from sending from them improperly or losing the paper.
@_date: 2016-09-30 14:25:05
At current BFX token price and after the ~2.5% they paid back, it's less than 20% of your money.
That said, I don't think this is important for point, nor does it help to act like a dick here.
@_date: 2016-10-01 01:52:47
This is the second time they have paid 1.x%, giving more confidence to their promise that they will continue to repurchase BFX shares over time. That is the good news. This good news has also pushed the BFX price up, reducing losses further.
Also at current BFX rates of ~$0.60 the total loss is about 14%, not 36%.
