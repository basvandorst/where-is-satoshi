Why GoldCoin, if I may ask?

We just experienced a drop of &gt;30% (Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, BTC-e), the current price might be the lowest in the foreseeable future. Or it might not. Seriously, nearly no one here knows.
Most importantly, do not invest money you are not prepared to lose.

Getting the money out of BTC China in USD is quite hard. If it was easy loads would be doing it.

No local businesses accept btc as of yet, but I will use it in day to day transactions as soon as I can.

Confirm or deny what?

You know FUD is used to describe something that affects the perception of something negatively, right? There's no element of fear or doubt in this article.

Ah, right. I thought everyone here was following the rate at all times, so I thought the last part had to be something else.

Why Quark? It's already 98% generated, which means someone is holding a hell of a lot of it.

A close friend bought in April, after the first crash, as did I. Another close friend wants to buy at the moment, but is skeptical due to the massive increase over the last couple of weeks. That's about it.

What kind of businesses are you closing down?
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:16:40
It's down $11 from all time high.

Actually, I think it was [this one,]( so he wasn't scratching his chin.
