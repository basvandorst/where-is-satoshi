@_date: 2018-01-09 12:58:35

@_date: 2017-11-05 17:47:29
What should people use instead?

It’s important to remember that if no one did stuff like that we wouldn’t be where we are today. If no one spent it, it wouldn’t be worth anything.

 in case anyone else fancies checking it out. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:53:17
For anyone who doesn't like squinting. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:47:17
