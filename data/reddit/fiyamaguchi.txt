Ok, now we’re official!

You’re vastly overestimating most people. It needs to be really simple to understand. Like “It’s like Apple pay, but it’s an international currency” and nothing more. Of course, I understand that explanation is way way off base, but we’re talking about how to simplify it for the masses here. That means, they don’t care how it really works, they just want a simple and easy to understand image of what it is.

Extremely likely*

Over 12k on coinmarketcap! Let the memes roll!

That’s true, my point was I think many people initially resisted smartphones, even if just for a moment, saying it’s too expensive, and I have a perfectly functioning phone now. Then they understood when they saw it’s not really a phone.

Thank you so much, this is just what I was looking for! Subscribing to r/bitcoinmarkets

Time to give up on that club, and instead popularize the 2.1 BTC club?

I mostly use mobile, but I fired up my slow, old laptop, just for you :-)

I can see what you mean... ok how about explaining why you need a smartphone... if you explain the technical details of it, no-one would understand what the heck you were talking about. If you just show it and give a simple explanation, people get it and understand that they can’t live without it.

Now we’re getting to a simple and easy to understand explanation! I have no idea how a microwave works, nor do I care. I just want hot food quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:19:35
Thank you for the information! I’m now following your updates and I’ll be happy to see your real site!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:44
Smashed through 14k on Gdax! Good way to wake up here!
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:46:59
I guess I first saw your posts a few months back, then searched for that site, assuming it was by the same person. Ok, I’m now following you, and un-bookmarking that site. Thank you again for all your effort!

I’m guessing Philippines?

I see my address is a P2SH address. What are the average fees from Segwit to Segwit addresses and where can I find this information by myself? Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:37:43
Wow, on Bithumb it’s trading for like $14,700! Craziness!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:10:33
Sorry, I meant regular consumers. I like the simplicity of “It’s digital gold”. That’s relatively easy to understand for most people.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:14:18
Wow, was that really 6 days ago?! It feels like, and the data seems like, months ago! Crypto-time really messes you up, huh?
Edit: Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:13:14
Sorry if it came across that way. I was talking more about the increasing psychological barrier that people don’t want to pay $1000 for 0.0001 of anything, but they may be more willing to buy it if we say “100,000 Sats” or something like that. It was more a question of semantics
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:29:04
I understand. Still, a short and simple introduction is likely to get people interested and asking questions for a few minutes. A long explanation is likely to scare people off.
What are US dollars? 
It’s something you use to buy things. 
Or... 
It’s somewhat of a form of IOU system which used to be based on gold and silver but was then converted into a paper system which is created by a central... but not really based on...
Which is easy to understand and which sounds scammy? If we’re going to make crypto mainstream we need to make it simple and inviting.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:23:53
I wonder how long it’ll take to get to 10,000... If a fraction of the people from r/all buy in, it’s entirely possible by the end of the week, if not the end of the day! Then we’re really off to the races!

At first, I thought this was great news, but then I checked the details. Bitflyer has around 800,000 customers, but will be choosing only 1000 to give the card to in a kind of lottery. 
Also, the main thing is that the card is valid for 5 years, and has a one million yen, less than $8,900, lifetime limit. If you used it for groceries and utilities and so on, you'd probably be finished being able to use it within one year!
