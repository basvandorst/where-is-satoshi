It's only causing a shitstorm for the paranoid anarchists here, the rest of us understand what he was trying to say.

Neal Palmquist?

Well that's not very nice.

Bitcoin is an open application platform, not an app. Some platforms do take 10 years to hit critical mass.

A lot of public harm is reduced through regulation. That's why we have safety regulations for automobiles, licensing requirements for restaurants, and its why your electronic devices have all those certification stamps on the back - lest they catch on fire and burn your house to the ground.
Same goes for financial regulation. A little bit of up-front regulation can save a lot of money and grief for investors and society in the long run.

Apparently not!


This is also why the BIP101 patch was substantially larger than the initial segwit patch.

Yeah but you don't see Gregory Maxwell attacking Bitcoin like a jilted lover.

Your side seems to think that mining hashrate alone can force the rest of the nodes to accept a chain with different consensus rules. The 
Exchanges understand that its their nodes and the rest of the node operators that actually decide what is and isn't the valid chain and what is and isn't called Bitcoin.

It's a private organization. People need to understand this before willingly assisting them with taking control of the main software client.

Good. Antpool deserves to go out of business for what they did.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:24:21
The shit stirring was started by Roger and Jihan threatening to fork with a mere 70% of hashpower and with no consideration to what the users and businesses wanted.

It isn't... the network is fully functional. How is that "on fire"?
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:49:02
And they've also held Bitcoin true to the original vision. I'm worried that another team will be less disciplined and will add whatever feature-of-the-week that causes Bitcoin to veer off-rack into centralization land.

You gotta give the other contributors credit for being disgusted at that PR. I doubt it would ever be committed. It's too bad that "cointracker" feels that compromising privacy is worth maintaining its ill-advised business model. 
It's interesting to see such a ham-handed attempt by one business to change the code for its own interests. Imagine what a smart company with resources could do. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:42:17
The economic majority would then be compelled to change the POW algorithm.... miners do not  hold all the power.
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:37:16
Well for one thing, they aren't doing any censoring, but theymos is and nobody agrees with it.

Give me a break! They clearly AGREE with the letter, that's what matters.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:22:40
It has no basis in reality, it's just their uneducated opinion.

Poloniex: "[We will support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC](
Anyway, to quibble over the signature detail is silly because it misses the point which is that Poloniex will list BU-chain as BTU, not BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:01:44
The users of Bitcoin overwhelmingly support Core or at the very least  reject handing control of the block size limit to Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:22:23
As this post clearly demonstrates, it's way too early to say that Segwit is DOA when it's following a similar signalling growth rate as BIP66. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 10:52:35
Maybe they really believe that a 2MB hardfork should happen first as a "show of good faith" by the Core developers, or something like that. 
But it's nuts. SegWit is ready to go and it solves the quadratic-time signature verification problem so that a 2MB fork can happen soon after without Bitcoin incurring a DOS risk.
I really hope that the holdout miners stop listening to Roger Ver, who is well intentioned but lacks the technical depth to grasp that Bitcoin can't scale by merely changing the block size, not without destroying its value proposition.
@_date: 2015-08-30 06:08:56
It has been invaded by some really ignorant commenters... it is the same user names over and over again seriously misrepresenting the issues behind the blocksize debate. It makes me wonder if they are being paid to do it... they seem to use the same talking points.
@_date: 2015-08-30 06:05:39
If we weren't worried about decentralization, you would be right. But we are worried about decentralization, because that's the whole point of Bitcoin. That worry introduces a completely different dynamic into the equation that is at odds with a standard scalability problem. 
It's too bad that the nature of the blocksize issue keeps getting misrepresented like this. No wonder there's so much ignorant vitriol being spewed around here... comments like yours make people say "yeah! why don't they raise the limit, it is so obvious!"
@_date: 2016-10-24 02:32:57
Yes and the only thing that gives Bitcoin value is decentralization. It's the only reason for Bitcoin exist, so it should be maximized as much as possible... it should be the number one priority.
The other problem with BU is with the quality of its team. It should give everyone pause as to who would be the gatekeeper of features for the main client implementation under a hypothetical scenario of a hardfork takeover. It means passing control from the current team to new team.
With Core, you have a large collection of accomplished computer scientists from the fields of cryptography and networking working together under a pretty compelling consensus governance model.  
With BU, you have a much smaller crew of what appear to be mostly unaccomplished wannabes, and it isn't clear that it isn't just going to be run as a dictatorship. 
I know which team I'll be sticking with should the system face a significant fork threat, however unlikely. And it will be the team that best understands how to preserve decentralization in Bitcoin.

Don't be so obtuse. We're on to you.

They started in Canada, where offering unlicensed securities is illegal. That history doesn't just go away.
As far as Panama goes - do they actually have the necessary license from the CNV to operate as a stock exchange?
@_date: 2016-10-11 08:53:36
This is the most logical explanation.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:53:09
 How is that a criticism? The system can change you know.
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:38:09
Right, it's POS plus 100 handpicked "delegates" to try to overcome the fatal issues with POS. Funny how POS keeps having to get adjusted to require more and more effort to keep it secure. Eventually it will turn into the rube goldberg version of POW.
@_date: 2015-02-24 00:03:06
There are far more miners that can freely switch between mining pools than there are delegates.
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:56:32
It just came out a few weeks ago. It's a bit strange to declare it a failure at this stage.
