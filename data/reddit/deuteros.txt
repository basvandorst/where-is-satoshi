And how many college dropouts end up like Bill Gates?
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:19:02
That's like saying that dropping out of college is a good decision because Bill Gates did it and is now a billionaire.

That's literally no better than carrying around cash.


Cash deposited in a bank account is protected from theft and bank insolvency. There are no such protections for Bitcoin.

The FDIC has an almost 90 year history of making good on its promises. What does Bitcoin have? There's no FDIC for Bitcoin and there's no protection if your bitcoins are lost or stolen.
The FDIC is as close to a 100% guarantee as you can get in the world of deposit insurance. But you're criticizing it when Bitcoin has a far worse problem?

Many times. I almost never use one that charges a fee.
I can also get cash from the bank or pay with a debit card without paying a fee as well.


Greece doesn't have control over EU monetary policy. I also don't live in Greece so it's not relevant to me.

Bitcoin was never illegal, so it's not really like weed legalization.

If everyone hoarded BTC it would be effectively worthless because what's the point of it?

So what? Sometimes you have to spend money to make money.

Debt is a tool and debt is not inherently bad. Debt is good when used to finance an investment into an asset that will produce long term income or will grow in value. Debt is bad when used to purchase consumables or consumer goods.
The key to debt is moderation.
An economy without debt would be much smaller and would grow much more slowly. Only the rich would have access to capital.

I didn't say deflation is inherently bad. I said prolonged deflation is bad. In periods of severe deflation like the Great Depression, where prices dropped as much as 10% per year, even an interest free loan would be unattractive.

Sell ASAP and cut your losses. Never borrow money to finance what is basically a gamble.

But when my deposits at the bank are insured and I don't get charged a fee to take the money out and spend it, then *is* the point of bitcoin?
I mean we can say it's freedom from the banks but that doesn't seem to leave people better off.

Except gold is a useful tangible asset. The energy that went into producing bitcoins is gone forever and completely useless.


No it doesn't.

Moderate deflation isn't necessarily a bad thing but prolonged periods of deflation are bad for the economy.
If prices keep falling then people start hoarding their cash because they don't want to buy something today that's going to be cheaper tomorrow.
What makes deflation really bad is that anyone who has outstanding debt gets screwed. Deflation means prices and wages go down, but any debts you owe stay the same. If the purchasing power of a dollar doubles, that means the value of debt you owe effectively doubles as well.

Yeah, by 1995 the potential of the Internet to change everything was widely appreciated and the number of users was increasing by massive amounts each year. The author of this article was just being contrarian.

From June to November maybe. The rest of the year has been more or less a continuous downward slide.

Amazon and Apple have assets that generate income, so it shouldn't be too difficult to calculate a fair value.

Those are *extrinsic* things. *Intrinsic* value comes from the thing itself. The intrinsic value of gold comes from its natural properties like malleability and resistance to corrosion, and from its usefulness in manufacturing and creating jewelry. Those properties are unaffected by the value of gold and would still exist even if gold were cheap and easy to get.
Currencies, crypto or otherwise, don't really have any intrinsic value beyond being a medium of exchange. Even that might not really be an intrinsic property because its utility is dependent on extrinsic factors, such as the willingness of others to accept it as payment. Monopoly money is a medium of exchange, but good luck trying to use it outside a game of Monopoly.

The costs associated with creating a bitcoin are not a measure of intrinsic value. Production costs can affect extrinsic value, but only in relation to demand. If it costs $100 to create a useless widget, the value of that widget is $0.
*Intrinsic* value is what you have when you strip away what gives something *extrinsic* value, like supply and demand.
Take gold for example. The price of gold is high because lots of people want it and it's hard to get more of it. There are many people who buy gold simply because it's valuable (similar to Bitcoin). But if gold were plentiful and cheap would it still have intrinsic value? Yes, because people also desire gold for its intrinsic properties like malleability, resistance to corrosion, and its usefulness in manufacturing and creating jewelry. Those things have nothing to do with how much it costs to mine gold.
Now what about Bitcoin? Its only intrinsic value is its usefulness as a medium of exchange. But compared to other options such as the USD, Bitcoin's utility falls far short.
