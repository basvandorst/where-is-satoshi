My example actually called the drop. Look at when that was published. It basically said we were ahead of the long term growth rate and with in the error of the model to predict the drop. Now we are at the other exact opposite end of the oscillation. The price is below the long term growth rate and with in the error measurement. So the prior prediction was short term down long term up.
Now the prediction is short term up long term up.
How many data points where you using. I don't think short term regressions tell you much. Its kinda like going into a casino and playing $2 and then saying its impossible to win. Some functions dont show their nature until after thousands of trials. Over all regression is just an advance way of playing the what if game as a way to set your expectations. OP is after the limits as am I. How fast can this thing grow. Just trying to litmus test some of these claims of a $100,000 bitcoin. As crazy as those claims are there is *some merit*

That business model is DOA. If the time and effort to make the transaction exceeds the value of the users time to do it in the first place its a non starter.
The web hates troll bridges or jumping thru hoops. It just adds friction. We need a system that you voluntarily pay once in a while and sorts out all of the details for us. People seem to be responsive to Wikipedia style fund drives.
The other problem is there is no mechanism for price discovery. Who decides what one page is worth. Also this ends up being regressive as those who can afford to pay the least would be excluded from the market place of ideas.
Now I would see one major exception to that. But it would be for more expensive content. Maybe a crowd based binary paywall where no one gets the content until some goal is met. But this is still in line with allowing the users control the release date.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:46:56
Criminals will just break the chain of custody or avoid the honey pots. Either way the transactions sill remain immaterial. Regulation is only a threat to centralized exchanges. Plus the more friction you add the more valuable Bitcoin becomes. People will just not cash out. So the regulators have honest actors cashing in and out. Criminals and Investors only cashing in and how do you tell the difference. Once we hit some tipping point the feedback loop gets stronger and stronger after each cycle. Either way regulating the transactions is truly a fools errand.

Its thee model...... the only show in town for what we are studying. 
R2 is just one metric and potentially misleading. In allot of cases it gives you a good idea of the potential predictive power. 
But a R2 of over .90 on a log scale is interesting. It looks like exponential growth. It smells like exponential growth. But if we had 5-7 years of solid data correlating to a expo growth the price would already be 50K.

Kinda funny though. When I have to explain Bitcoin I start off by explain its basically digital gold. After you go do the rabbit hole this is the conclusion. 
This is why me and all the dorks you know are all whipped up. How do you tell people about that. Its Digital-Gold backed by gold. 
This would be the same as someone backing their gold with silver. wtf

I think you could base a theory of money by watching children. If a toy is sitting in a room not in use it is worthless. But if that same toy is picked up by a single child it instantly becomes the most prized possession of all of the children currently in the room, and the scarcity created causes a violent dispute to erupt.

WiWr is correct. 
With 7 Billion People you end up being 1 in 13,441. 
11,000/455 =24.17
If you apply the 80/20 distribution rule it will end up be far less in reality. Odds are less than 50,000 people probably have that many coins.

Sure but as long as the average value per share and the proof of work are in line I don't think there would be much of an incentive. But it would depend on the number of sites and the funds in the pool. If someone can make a profit it will be done.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:15:01
Since inflation should be no more than 2% per year, the economics follow that capital gains should be no more than 2% on average aswell. The government should just offer an amnesty program. When you purchase something you send them 2% to their BitCoin address. If your audited and you can show that you paid your taxes and no other taxes should be due.

From a stand point of liberty. I believe allot of us are clear on what we are doing. I ultimately don't want more dollars out of this. The price to me is just a way to track the progress of the Bitcoin's growth. I have no intention to cash out.
Philosophically you can apply the thought process in another way and determine how you would choose.
In a relationship you can choose to be controlling and ultimately it is guaranteed to eventually destroy the relationship.
The converse is you can respect the other individuals freedom, now this does not guarantee it will last forever but it has the potential too.

The proof of work would be done in a way as to avoid this and accepting proof of work shares at an exponentially slowing rate. That's how the time on site would be measured as well.
So you only do a Proof every  8 16 32 64....... seconds. And these would only target 1/10 of a second. It would be an experiment. The idea would be to make it so you dont even notice.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:06:51
I think this hits at the point of the micro as well, at some point the demand is based on buying it on the margin. Especial in the housing bubble. You knew something was wrong when people were buying for what they could sell it for they were using the price curve from the bubble to predict. This feed back loop created a self fulfilling prophecy. Until it didnt. If the demand is based on utility its hard to go wrong as the buyers will try to optimize the prices. This happens in stocks as well and even bitcoin. A stocks utility is its dividend, and if you buy it based on the income it provides you cant go wrong. I'm sure lot's of people would argue. But any stock that don't pay a dividend should be delisted after 3 years. Bitcoin is much the same it should be purchased for its utility. I think allot of people buy Bitcoin based on how many more dollars they might make. But I think as some point the game is going to flip and the dollar becomes the bubble.

In any transaction there is more that just the price there is also the time. 
Time is money and the psychological cost of any ACTIVE system that requires people to do something or interrupts their flow...... even a "click" is not going to make it. The click is going to be on the back button.
What if the content was not that great how do I get a refund. How does this help a forum operator or educational site pay the bills.
I checked out the BitWall site and they plan on having you signup aswell. This raises the barrier even higher. And with what I am talking about you can donate anonymously. If the money is good we dont care who you are. That fits the ethos of bitcoin to a tee. And is the enabling tipping point of the system that I have outlined.
A Passive system has a chance. As long as it is fair and trusted. In fact I will go as far as to predict all micro-payment systems will be primarily passive.

@_date: 2014-03-31 23:19:41
Your missing the point. Its not my model. No more than calculating an average. It is a reflection of the underlying data and understanding what it is telling you. Regression can be no more wrong than the variability in the underlying data. This is why we are after the underlying compound accumulation function and the limit of the error. Then we want to know how far the current situation is off from the model and you can make some predictions about what will happen next. The goal is not to know the next card out of the shoe. What you need to know is when too bet big based on the statistical advantage. It doesn't mean your going to win the next hand. So it can go down further. But it looks like we are in a buyers market at the moment......
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:46:39
Problem is True Micro-payments cant go on the block chain.
No one is ever going to actual think or take the time to send $0.0001 cent. But they probably would send $10 once a year to an automated system they believe is fair and distributed the funds to the sites they care about most.
Target audience is pretty much everyone.

@_date: 2014-02-01 05:06:08
Well obviously it can play out a few different ways. I have contemplated your totalitarian scenario. To do this would reveal that the whole consent of the governed is toast. I still believe in these romanticized libertarian ideals.
I can also admit that Bitcoin in some ways scares the shit out of me. It's kinda exhilarating. But its absolute accountability and authority over your own money. 
If you look at the potential for evil the power is just as great as the good. It makes taxes, court settlements, child support and alimony optional. Enables some pretty innovative kidnapping schemes and anonymous assassination markets. And then you got viruses that encrypt your files and demand ransom. It cannot be un-invented but it is a brave new world we are entering.
But there are scenarios where it just might go differently. I mean Bitcoin is not extremely attractive if the dollar remains reserve or could be strengthened. But if we lose petrol dollar status and there is a run. It wont matter what laws are in place because that environment will go from trying to regulate to asking for a job in the same weekend. 
Our society does have its issues with corruption like any empire. But we do have some freedoms and america does still have quite a bit of innovation the internet does seem to be working and not entirely under anyone's thumb. I mean how bad is it, I'm having a beer and expressing my self.
 The other though I have been thinking along the lines of game theory is Bitcoin kinda corrupts everyone it touches. There have got to be government officials that are also gold bugs so Bitcoin is going to appeal to them. I bet Lawysk owns some. And if not at some point I think as time goes on even the nannies might see that this could be a better way. 
I mean really even rent seeking government employees are not that wealthy. Bitcoin is an opportunity for all, there just aren't any special seats at the head of the table.
