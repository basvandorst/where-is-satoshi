too late

IMO the limit may never be raised, as it will never be a good enough reason for a hard-fork. I think a lot of confusion about whether or not hardforks are acceptable (they're really not) comes from the core devs refusal to totally rule them out.. like maybe if ECDSA is broken then there would be little lost by abandoning the original network since it's now totally fucked anyway.. those are the kinds of considerations that prevent core devs from just saying 'no hard forks ever'.. but I think the layman would have a much better understanding of the issue if it were framed in that context. The protocol basically can't be upgraded, ever.. except maybe in extreme circumstances where everything is already lost.. all we can actually do is build stuff on top of what's already there. Sure anyone can hardfork into an altcoin at any time, but most likely none of these will ever achieve the marketshare of the old/current/already existing bitcoin.
There are also real limits to how far you can take onchain scaling.. and they're pretty close to 1MB.. maybe you could do 8MB I dunno, but it doesn't really matter... in a couple of years we'll be at the new limit agian. It's pretty obvious that the only way forward is some layer two solution, and once in place even 1MB blocks will be fine for the forseeable future and probably forever - so it's just never going to be a good enough reason to start over.

yes - that's a teredo address.. maps back to 70.68.73.137 which is a shaw address

I don't think this is anything to be concerned about.. yes people can reach you on your teredo IP though. If any other services were listening they would be reachable as well.. teredo is nothing specifically to do with bitcoin.. it's just that teredo addresses are considered low priority, so they will never be used by a web browser in preference to IPv4.. so it would only be used for web browsing if you tried to browse a site that was IPv6 only.. similarly any client protocols that use DNS and return v6 and v4 records will probably always use v4 and not the teredo interface. Bitcoin doesn't use DNS and doesn't prefer v4 peers, so it will make use of teredo if it's available.. similarly if you use bittorrent it will probably also use it. 
If you explicitly browse to  you should see the sprint homepage, via teredo

I guess it might be a privacy issue.. but it is what happens.

It takes 75% of a 8064 block period (so 6048 blocks) to lock in. During the last period the 75% threshold was not achieved so it starts over.
We're 125 blocks into the current cycle and 101 blocks with segwit support. If we continue at this rate it should lock-in in about two weeks.
