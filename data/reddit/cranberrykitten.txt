Is it a mistake or purposefully misleading? Knowing paypal, it's probably the latter. I doubt anyone could've possibly counted all 21 countries and NOT noticed that there were doubles.

Not really, I see it as the same as asking a place if they take credit card. No one would consider that douchey.

That's their problem then? I'm not going to be afraid to ask if people accept bitcoin over it.

I just cancelled mine a few weeks ago after they refused to refund me money after I was scammed because "that purchase isn't eligible for buyer protection." No explanation as to why that was either. I ended up having to contact my bank and they were happy to help.

I just had a problem with them too. My transaction took WAY longer to go through than it should have for buying bitcoins, and then it took about 12 hours to transfer from coinbase to an address, even though it says one hour. Would not recommend.

I'm the sick fuck for pointing out shitty things people say, but it's okay to want to look at pictures of people who committed suicide for enjoyment? LOL OKAY. Nice try to derail the conversation, but it's still fucking sick.

This sort of thing is why I refuse to leave any money in bitcoins. I use them as soon as I buy them. It's just way too easy to get them stolen by random exploits.

He used to obviously know about bitcoin, just hasn't paid attention to it lately. There's also nothing you can't figure out on a quick google search.

Thanks for the advice. It just kind of scares me because I consider myself moderately computer savvy, but nothing crazy. It's scary to know one slight slip up, like just checking your bitcoin balance on your phone, could cause you to lose a ton of money.

You people are sick fucks.

This is a thread about preventing suicide and you're being an asshat. Have some human decency. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:58:36
Not an appropriate time for jokes.
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:03:57
Well, honestly the guy was an asshole too so I don't feel bad.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:36:46
Yup. What's your point?
