As much as I hate XRP, that’s not any time in the near future

My thoughts exactly. Great way to lose some sats

Don’t download minergate, when I was a noob I used them for eth, thought my card sucked getting 11 MHs, switched to claymore and got 25.6MHs on my RX480. Would say check out XMR stak for cpu mining, though difficulty on all coins will likely not yield a profit

Software would likely have to be product/manufacturer specific if trying to use an asic pointed at a nicehash stratum
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:13:45
Yeah. Annual spend in bitcoin doesnt get me a free transatlantic business class flight unless we go back to 2016-17

Yeah. Pants were nearly shat here

I’m down for a tad bit longer of stagnation, full on hodl’er here, I’m down for a good gpu market in the near-future. Need some cheap RX580s or eBay to be flooded with 480s and 1060s for another rig or 4 for ETH or any other asic resistant-ish coin. I won’t part with my ETH, ZEC, or RVN till the 2020’s. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:18:32
We're in for a good market upcoming. With Ethereum prices being so low and Zcash being killed by asics, people just arent buying right now. Miners are buying the firesale rigs from people leaving crypto and it have yet to see really any cards sell out besides direct from Nvidia, EVGA midweek madness, or when ASUS ROG RX580s were sub 200 on amazon with rebates

Technically the furthest away so would be last. 2 more years of winter confirmed

I'm not mad at coinbase, I was a dipshit and didnt check fees. Thats all I was saying
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:01:27
Yeah, I got fucked big time during Nov or Dec 2017 when I didnt see what the network fee was on coinbase. Spent $40 in BTC to spend $10 one time
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:17:15
Says you?
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:47:29
Fuck you you sack of shit

I never laugh and made an audible giggle at this one

Bout to piss yourself, have fun waiting for confirmation
@_date: 2019-04-19 05:23:49
I have no BCH, I sold it shortly after the fork to pay for a vacation. 95% of my holdings are BTC, ETH, and ZEC.
In 2017 I sent a specified amount of BTC from coinbase and didn't pay attention to the fees. I'm in no way talking bad about BTC, I was sharing one of my shit experiences.
I'm one of the few that have been in long enough to be up considerably even at today's prices.

I’ll eat 10 pounds of cat shit if that happens. With a smile

Nah, everyone in BTC dreams of a yacht full of hoes, what good would that do me?

I got a little let down when I checked Yahoo finance

How about from December 2017?

As well as unless you have had prior issues overseas and would be at risk of additional screening, I’d have little to no fear of it. they’re going to ask you length of stay, reason for visit, where you’re staying, affiliations, ever expelled from another country, you plan on working, etc. Relax and enjoy your vacation

Can you sell a $100 bill for btc?
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:03:06
Yeah. Just used some USD at Taco Bell

If you purchased with a bank account they just want to make sure your shit dont bounce. Buy with a debit card, you can send literally 2 minutes after purchase. I do it all the time and move it to exodus
