Not to be condescending but you need to do more research. This is only one parameter and a shallow one at that. There's nothing special about most low fee coins now. All of the major block chains will have low fees in a couple of years. Think bigger.

Sorry if I came across that way but again look at what this post is about. Lightning network will be practically free, instant, anoymous transactions. There are cheaper payment channels currently. However, when bitcoin has the LN what will these other coins be? I can value your side as a business but there all also others here looking for investment insight. I think it would be foolish to invest short sighted in a free transaction coin.

I don't have $100,000 for a bond...

Exactly. In this example Bitcoin would also be considered in the same category as gold. It is being 'produced' at a constant predictable rate. There is a limit to the amount of Bitcoins that will eventually be produced. No government is reaping the benefits of it's production. It's a valuable long term asset. Virtual gold.

When you HODL all the forks you always win ��

Everyone please be aware crypto currency is in a bubble and I belive this is the start of the crash. It will take the prices down but rest assured we will recover in the following months and it will only be a matter of time until the next bubble happens driving he price to $5000, $8000, or maybe even $10,000. Bitcoin has a very low inflation rate so it will hit us the least hard in the long run. When everyone else panics and the price drops HODL and BUY!

It absolutely does not. Bitcoin is a public leger technology.

Many people don't want to get burned. It's pretty easy to sell at the bottom when the fear gets the best of you and have to rebuy when it's higher. In my opinion a smart long term inverter hodls and buys more at the bottom. Taxes also play a big part too. If I'm not mistaken you lose 25% every conversion.

Just pay attention to this subreddit and it's pretty easy to tell when big things will happen. I think I read a study that said online Bitcoin forms predict price action correctly 80% of the time.

It takes experience. There was no doubt in my mind that we were in a bubble. All of news stories and hype not to mention seemingly endless gains. Now my prediction is the market will stabilize in August, we may have more volatility in November with the chain split. After that the market will stabilize and slowly increase then eventually (it was 3 years last time) something will spark another bubble like this one and the cycle continues.

Gold actually goes down in recession contrary to popular belief.

Simply Bip148 supports segwit which makes transactions smaller and double the transaction block size to 2mb. It also allows for off scale transactions on the lightning network, meaning transactions are held off chain to save space. Segwitx2 will activate segwit then later hard fork to allow 4mb blocks. Many however critize it because they believe it's too rushed to be done right and the Chinese mining cartel will later use it to deactivate segwit etc. You can find more info if you look. Just remember to wade through the misinformation and propaganda on both sides.

Remind yourself of this a year from now. All the old traders I met transformed into HODLers because they saw they would have made much more sitting on it.

I started looking into Bitcoin in middle school when it was around $20 as a way to make extra money at home. I remember downloading a wallet and not being able to figure out how to 'mine' on it. It seemed too complicated and I gave up. I probably would have traded for fiat anyway. I later rediscovered it and invested all of my remaining college savings in it last summer at $580. I became a HODLer after I realized my ROI was way higher than student loans charge.

It's very relevant and will continue to be for a long while. People see high fees and panic. It's almost comparable to modern day responses to terrorism. Many are quickly willing to give away their freedom and rights to fear. Increasing block size will undermine what makes bitcoin what it is, a revolutionary tool that will change the world. Bitcoin's resistance to change like block size increase shows its true power in defying the few who wish to control and exploit it. We will fight through the corrupt and enable safe scaling solutions in time. I do think that there will need to be block size limit increases in time. The question is where to draw the line. Players like Jihan Wu, want that to be upwards of 64mbs fulfilling the centralized prophecy. Other coins may rise in the short term but these principles are what will make Bitcoin change the monetary ecosystem forever. Do not compromise.

There will still be many transactions on chain. Lightning network will be more of a tool for smaller, more trusted transactions such as the cliche buying coffee instantly and cheaply.
