So people that have been doing the mining to generate income can, possibly, receive more outcome?

Bitpay has been the main sponsor so far, monetary wise
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:44:36
The reason I'm in is because the USD is going down. I'm not using this as stock.

I received ~ 5$ from tips and tipped someone, who annoyingly refused to take it, and had a blast watching the game. 10/10 experience and it game me the opportunity to inform my family about bitcoin as well. I cannot wait for next years bitcoin bowl

If I was your employee, I'd ask for my paycheck to be split 50/50 with bitcoins/currency. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:22:42
Many people treat it as stock then and not a currency?

I'm here for the long run. While it is disheartening to see the $20 USD I spent  decrease in value, I want to see what actually happens. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:08:24
Any idea why?
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:31:49
It is my understanding that more people are selling than buying since all bitpay talked about was selling your bitcoins and not buying them 
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:36:55
Thanks! I can't wait to play. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:24:33
Any plans to port to android?
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:49:26
I don't know what to tell you. I bought $20 worth and it went through immediately.

How does one invest bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:31:11
Ahhh okay. I didn’t know if you meant invest like invest it in to something, not just invest in itself. Thanks!

You can split a bit. It's like the Satoshi or something.
