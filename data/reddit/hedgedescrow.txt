@_date: 2018-01-19 14:39:09
wire not credited ppl  assume cb fault but in fact its receiving bank doesnt credit it to correct account. i do dozens of wires monthly not btc related happens all the time
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:53:42
i wouldnt blame cb. lots of time when wire hit bank bank might not credit it to receiving account. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:10:57
i wont be surprised if cb not solvent . how in hell they manage selling btc to 13 mil ppl?
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:22:28
no kyc? they wont get any real volume .. good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:37:49

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:13:01

my dad is 70 yo. he never thought much of bitcoin ever. Once he asked me to help him to buy rx glasses off of lens.com or lenses.com cant remember site exactly. At the checkout they offered to make payment with bitcoin. I told my dad his glasses were purhcased using bitcoins. He says "it is money now"
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:52:26
Useless to me, you can't sell coins bought some place else
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:24:07
stopped using them after they required id for small time traders like me
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:01:38
no bank transfer, They have option to deposit via coinbase account
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:40:52
It would be easier to switch banks. I have tenants in 3 different states depositing cash to wells Fargo. Never had issue
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:32:04

@_date: 2014-05-05 17:37:32
gambling using credit cards is illegal in us. Bank shouldnt approve this transaction unless poker guys using different merchant account. This transaction is illegal.
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:19:30
I have account with Chase.been buying coins with coinbase bitstamp btc e for couple of years now. No issue. The key it's to have business account not personal
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:03:26
I understand gox now. I'm in same boat. I have one bitcoin client and over 10 wallets. Couple of months ago i found wallet from 2012 with 30 coins in it, just out of blue. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:55:50
well, since i registered couple of hours ago i sent $50 worth of coins using coinbase account. Advcash charged 1% for deposit.  I was able to purchase virtual visa and  used it on amazon. lets see how it turns out.
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:32:56
dont know yet. just registered. they do accept coins from coinbase account.
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:20:33
gyft sells gift cards for whole foods
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:30:01
i use chase to wire to bitstamp for about 6 months now , never issue....They did same thing to me by blocking my account when i tried to wire to Cyprus. But account was unlocked as soon as i visited branch.
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:04:55
if customers personally signs cc or giftcard receipt chargeback is almost impossible
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:56:28
thats because Colorado is about to open first bank that will service these guys
@_date: 2019-11-19 01:40:31
tor nodes are public. all cops need is tor nodes ip and they will see who connects
@_date: 2019-11-17 17:12:53
darknet not safe anymore. cops make purchase, see where it came from , check for all tor nodes in shipping area. they can tell exactly what net provider was used. then make few more purchases and you know exactly who drops them
@_date: 2019-11-02 13:57:24
somebody selling $1k visa for $700 seems like real deal. obviously scam. i reported site to google. suggest you all do the same
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:05:32
looks too dollary
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:23:42
custodial  means control of funds. ms is controled by exchange keys. so it is custodial
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:00:42
this post not true.i invested some monies in 2011. it was about $6 per coin. $100 would buy me 15 coins . it aint 1 mil today
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:29
hard to send bitcoin. nothing works but to hold. unusable at the moment
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:19:19
sorry kid.i thought you lil older
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:43:00
i would use it but not enough payment options. Looking for gift cards, amazon, target, walmart to buy
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:55:06
 i  find it more confusing vs coinbase
@_date: 2019-10-22 00:48:47
i'd rather get amazon gift card from bitpay, gyft or egifter
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:17:53
this worth few mil of usd.  each zwd=0.00257 usd
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:07:12
i get funds from coinbase same days if i withdraw in the morning
@_date: 2019-10-25 01:33:49
i only load it right before spending
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:36:32
what a weird name for exchange. buy/sell is opposite to hodl
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:38:05
i have an idea. stop telling others what to do
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:25:48
i didnt notice any fee increase. but i'm always maker. maybe they sent it to takers?
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:07:14
they buy your btc right away. they want to make sure it confirms in very next block
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:30:14
bunch of freeloaders. bitpay should work for free.  all prepaid debit in usa will charge you some kind of fee.
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:38:22
i stopped buying coins from both guys and buy them from lbc at market rate. Helping ppl get rid of their coins by depositing cash to their account. thats all
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:40:54
so many ppl borrowing money to get involved. i dont think its gonna end well. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:40:21
Im paying my expedia bill once in a while maybe i shouldn't
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:27:50
you cant fight gravity
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:32:01
using btc to pay for something is stupid. there stablecoins for that
@_date: 2019-02-15 14:28:28
sure. everybody should hate bitpay now?
@_date: 2019-02-15 13:18:06
I love their debit card. Fastest way to convert btc to fiat. If you can't handle $5 don't use it. If you didn't use card for 90 days you don't need it
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:26
i hate them. they make way to easy to get it . ppl lost heads, borrowing money to get in. thats not gonna end good. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:51:38

how do you get usd from btcpay server?
@_date: 2019-04-13 21:23:40
faketoshi says hes real. AU gov should tax his wallet and see if he pays up
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:44:02
you wont find $5 apple gift card. it doesnt exist. maybe outside of us but not in usd
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:08:16
nah, no experience needed
 [
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:39:32
it usualy goes up when nobody expects it. since everybody think it will go up at halving i have to guess it will go down
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:02:49
nothing to buy for $5 in apple store
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:22:06
what a coincidence. news came out on april 1st. i have to say fake news. no way stores will accept it  anytime soon..it costs more to send btc than use cc
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:34:37
26 yo docta?  wtf
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:14:43
gyft gets codes directly from amazon. most likely op had card from somebody else sitting in his account. amazon can charge back months
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:38:53

@_date: 2018-03-13 13:19:46

@_date: 2018-03-03 03:36:28
i couldnt sell at 4k. i'm taking them to court
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:00:05

@_date: 2018-03-11 13:56:50

@_date: 2018-03-01 00:25:27

@_date: 2019-09-15 15:31:53
new user should definitely stay away. when it comes to cash/fiat verification is must
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:04:31
hodl till what time? till you can buy everything for bitcoin? unfortunately i  have bills to pay, large family to feed. ONly sold little bit of my coins so i'm ready for another rally in next 2-3 years
@_date: 2019-09-14 20:32:34
so  HH allows users to buy btc via bank deposit wo verifying themselves? we all know hwo many scammers on lbc with verified info. my guess HH is filled with scammers waiting on pray
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:20:56
who in right mind will trust petro from venezuela? you cant trust this cockroach looking guy why trust crypto he created?
@_date: 2015-09-29 02:33:29
Coinbase spies on you.  I would use them for nothing
@_date: 2015-11-25 13:49:19
i have business where i send bunch of small bitcoins payments every day. Each payment is like $5-$7. I considered coinbase at first cause i have personal account with them and api but went ahead with coinkite . couldnt be happier
@_date: 2015-04-24 14:26:38
i booked condo in Winter Park,Co with expedia using my  coinbase account. Stayed there for 3 nights and hotel didnt even ask for credit card to keep on file. I did arrive at night when nobody was at front desk and grabbed key from box. Wonder how they handle all the vanadlism if no cc on file
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:05:16
My card pays me 2% to use it, so bitcramp fees not too bad
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:34:34
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:07:54

@_date: 2015-03-30 14:32:46
I would still be in business with them  if they didn't ask for ssn
@_date: 2015-10-27 12:39:37
You know youy can use lbc to buy bitcoins at 1-2 % marjet rate. Nobody will ask you questions there
