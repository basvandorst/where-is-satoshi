Maybe your right, but i was jk. That's become a meme right?

TIL there is a coin called Fedora Coin that is valued over $7M ahhaha
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:30:24

It's called a bribe....that's what a bribe is.

This isn't a bitcoin specific thing, but I'm getting so sick of headlines of these "articles" containing some sort of phrase like "here's what...." or "here's why..." or "here are the thing....".
Just the worst kind of click bait. It's so annoying, they build it up like it's some amazing thing that you simply MUST see, and it's usually just some crap. Like hey, how can I take 1 thing that somebody tweeted and write an entire article about that? Oh wait, that's impossible, I'll just write 50 words, slap 10 ads on that page and call it an article. So infuriating.

thank you
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:40:49
thank you. did not realize you could not withdraw from bitfinex, that's kinda fucked up. do they not have any money?
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:38:28
I obviously don't understand this. Why couldn't somebody buy on Bitfinex, send the coins to a wallet on another exchange and sell for an easy profit?
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:25:23
Well they've got Svalbard in the bag.
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:41:30

Extremely similar, and in some cases exactly the same wording as this article on Fortune.

What gives him any leverage? Why do we care if he is against segwit?

Circle, so hot right now. Circle.
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:53:10
Simple...but profound. I see what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:23:54
Also confused about this. Is there any risk to simply leaving my coins in coin base during this event?
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:58:53
No, what's the difference between wallet and vault?
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:29:47
Same. I would not trust myself with the keys
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:52:16
Don't worry. I ain't got 100 btc kek

@_date: 2016-05-20 04:53:02
Yeah, I realize that. I just kinda don't care slash don't think it'll happen to me. That's why it's a confession.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:24:19
