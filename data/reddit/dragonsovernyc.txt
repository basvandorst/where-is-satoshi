Okay is a seed like your password? Because I am looking on the Trevor website and I see the crypto steel for your recovery seed on the model t+, is this something you engrave? Again I’m so sorry for the questions

What do you mean? Like for buying bitcoin in general ?

Thank you so much, I did order it from the official site thankfully. Will be a lot more secure about buying bitcoin and other coins in the future once I have it

Thank you so much!

Oh wow thank you so much for this information I really appreciate you! I am going to go ahead and order that Trevor because it sounds like the best and most simple thing for me to use, especially since I’m just buying and storing bitcoin. I really appreciate you taking the time and effort for your response!

What is a u2f?

Oh wow and this whole time I’ve just had it sitting there. Thank you

Okay I just order the Trezor wallet, is that what that’s in reference to? Again I apologize for my ignorance

Very interesting; I will try the cash app in the future, as I am trying to stick away from Coinbase and only using Robin Hood to look at the prices. Is cash app what you best recommend ?
@_date: 2019-11-05 01:49:20
Ah I see, I think I’m going to get a hard wallet; I still can’t believe I didn’t know I could use cash app to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:46:53
So if I store it on Coinbase, can I buy a hardware wallet and take it out of the app and put it on the wallet?
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:16:53
But when it comes to actually buying bitcoin. What would you suggest? Cause I heard cash app is good as well
