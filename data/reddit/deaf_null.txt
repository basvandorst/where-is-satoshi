lol, this MLM shitcoin don’t even have a blockchain or CMC listing.
 is from the same people as OneCoin if I’m correct.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:35:33
And 8 billion turnover in 3 yrs, not bad. Except for the hodlers of course lol

We have a beer and that’s it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:40:58
This whole ‘Futures’ thing is blown out of proportion. Too many weak hands selling their coins. Bitcoin is King and still heading for 25K by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:49:54
I don’t think, I HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:42:16
Nice story. Just hodl and things will turn out just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:57:04
What’s on for today? Can’t seem to find that damn memo I get every morning.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:19:31
Trading between alts and btc is pretty stressful too. Buy into a few alts and btc and just hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:14:39
The Bitcoin bubble popped 7 years ago and ever since heading for Pluto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:38:26
What dip?
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:45:22
I’ve been hearing this for the past 5 years. Let the haters hate Bitcoin, you are the one drivin a Lambo soon.

Get your shit together. Find a new job asap and put some monthly money (what you are willing to lose) into cryptos.
Seriously, this state of mind “what if I had this or that” will fuck you up. Get over it, it’s gone, done, nothing to get that money back. The only thing you can change now is the future, so don’t get stuck in the past.
Good luck.

Nobody knows man. Just buy when you can and check the price in a year. A few grand is nothing.

Nah, I’ll keep the ATM instead.

@_date: 2017-08-19 18:43:26
Should've sold that shitcoin at $900. That sub is filled with idiots. Glad I'm still hodling my btc.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:18:49
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:21:52
Don't hope so, that would set btc back another year :(
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:24:59
Yes, in the movie. Coming out in the fall.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:25:02
Haha! Brilliant
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:40:10
Fork already happened. lol. But I would take it out anyways, don't leave it in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:54:21
This coin is goin' down. Right down to China Town!

Just wait until bcc gets released for sale
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:03:49
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:08:46
Well, that means cheaper buy ins, we should thank the Chinese miners.

When your exchange enabled the btc deposits again. Try a small amount first.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:55:30
Going to be the most expensive block in history ;)
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:39:15
Just waiting for BCC to be available, could take some time I presume, since we could get a major dump of BCC on all exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:48:32
Sold at $890,-, I'm happy :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:23:03
What's the alternative? Turkish bazar?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:17:10
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:07:23
That doesn't say anything. They still could have multiple servers throughout the States. 
Personally I don't think it's a hardware network issue.

Some guy offered me a time machine back in the 80's, but I had to pay him in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:04:03
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:08:56
Yeah, OMG rocks. It went up like crazy last few days, I got in just before the pump. A coin that actually has REAL use cases, compared to many Alt shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:16:13
A lot of limit orders filled probably :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:26:18
Where's the Rollercoaster Guy?! 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:39:07
Cool :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:30:23
When are the BCC gonna be released for selling? BCC is going to implode in seconds probably.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:38:22
The only thing that is keeping this price up is that not everybody can transfer them to sell.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:10:35
Yes, great livestream and informational!

Some Redditors can't read, so they check Rollercoaster guy and they know when to buy or sell then.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:17:27
Yes, and a good community
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:45:16
It's actually going up a bit now on Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:05:32
Oh yeah, that's what I meant :) I can deposit/withdraw btc again
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:20:07

BCC on Bittrex can be sold! I left some BTC on Bittex and got free BCC. Just sold, sorry bro ;)
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:05:15
I think you should light up another one.
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:18:57
Sell! And rebuy :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:10:57
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:25:16
Fuck that, I sold.
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:48:38

@_date: 2017-08-05 08:09:24
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:01:00
Yep, with some risk involved of leaving BTC on Bittrex during the split of course...
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:54:49
Nope, just the same old shit(coin)

Wanted to buy more yesterday and decided to wait and go to bed. Woke up facing an even better price :-) Express elevator to hell, goin' down! :-D
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:35:27
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:24:11
It's all relative. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:25:04
Then the price will probably shoot up. lol
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:25:11
Such wow coin.

Got my funds in at Polo, Rock 'n Roll!
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:07:34
I just purchased, conf took over 1,45 hours but they arrived eventually :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:36:32


@_date: 2017-07-31 05:40:41
Yes, with the chance of dropping fast the days after.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:58:50
Yeah, traded there back in 2006 when BTC was still 0,000000000053643 USD
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:35:31
You call this agressive?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:15:51
They have a daily amount of U$2000,- or equivalent to transfer funds from there? So if I trade 10K BTC at Polo I can send 10K btc to my wallet within 24hrs without passport verification?
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:08:52
Nobody knows what the price will do. Buy today if you want to be sure and hodl in wallet. Don't leave them on an exchange. Check what exchanges allow a quick withdraw without a lot of hassle, so you have time to withdraw all before Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:02:02
Guess so, you should be ok
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:04:40
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:20:23
1200-1300 is my guess. Could be anything really.

At least he's free, how Libertarian is that!
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:00:39

@_date: 2017-07-16 13:20:52

@_date: 2017-07-18 06:35:31
Huh? It was above 59% a while ago(?) and now around 58%. Is it normal to go up and down a bit?

@_date: 2017-07-30 06:43:48
So many exchanges with different rules. Binance allows you to withdraw 10btc daily without verification. But check first to be sure. Bittrex allows you 1btc daily withdraw without verification.
