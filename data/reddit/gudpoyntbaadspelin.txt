Inflation is a good thing. I’m not going to do the math but I wouldn’t be surprised if this came out to a healthy level of inflation per year.
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:46:17
That is called severe hyperinflation, something totally different. Inflation doesn’t make the government any more rich than its people... how is it robbing people through inflation?

1.6% is a very healthy growth rate. Most governments aim for 1-2% annually.

I had this same argument with him further down. He’s a complete moron that doesn’t understand basic economics. Don’t waste your breath.

These guys are both worth at least 8 figures. You think they’re worried about fractions of grams?

Life’s too short to be stingy, man

So what are you saying you want a deflating economy? You have no idea what you are talking about.
Edit: point me to one scholarly article claiming deflation is healthy basically

Best meme here yet. Good shit OP

It’s impossible to time the market. It’s funny that major corporations that devoted thousands of man hours couldn’t correctly predict its rise and fall. Yet one guy on his computer at home solved one of the holy grails of modern finance! You might have done the leg work, but that isn’t mutually exclusive with getting lucky. You need to understand that.

He guessed and was correct, which will happen here and there. I can 99.9% assure you he doesn’t use any valuation techniques that are superior to what anyone else uses. Sometimes it’s better to be lucky, than good.

Only sub that’s more REEE than r/WSB, though both are good for the laughs. And the occasional decent discussion.

Well you are disagreeing with all of Econ academia by saying that it doesn’t need to be stable. That’s a law established by economists, not a lousy opinion. It has NEVER been stable AT ALL, and therefor as of right now it is a failure as a currency. 
If anything it is an extremely risky investment, but I think blockchain will be more valuable for B2B or healthcare transactions. Not necessarily as a bona fide currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:51:47
It did fail in terms of being a currency. There are three laws that are used to define currency. One of those happens to be “is it a store of value”, and currently that answer HAS to be no. It is FAR to volatile. Yes it is a unit of account and a medium of exchange (not the best though).
Regardless of that, Bitcoin’s success (like every other currency) is bounded to the USD. It is the reserve currency of the world, anything that is a “currency” is going to be compared to it. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:07:25
I don’t really feel the need to validate my knowledge to you in any way. I’m trained in economics, and there are many features of bitcoin in which I think are valuable. That being said I don’t think bitcoin got everything right, meaning somebody else will be able to better utilize the technology. 
You almost definitely are invested in bitcoin, and therefor become emotional when talking about it. This doesn’t allow your brain to operate at in a capacity that optimizes rational thought. Therefor you defend bitcoin with your dying breath, as you try to singlehandedly disprove all of academia. 
An alternative coin will come around that makes bitcoin obsolete at some point in the future, looking at its Market Cap compared to other real currencies, it pretty much has always been obsolete. But people who otherwise could be making a fortune off of blockchain will lose it all, simply because they think the first mover advantage will outweigh all other competitive advantages future coins could have. Seems highly implausible.
Edit: Also what evidence do you base your claim of “it will be more stable in the future” from two comments above? Are you also a fortune teller? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:42:51
Oh I’m sorry your head is too far up your own ass to go look up how currency is defined by the rest of the world. Have fun living in la la land.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:24:34
Damn you’re really in deep, huh? And apparently don’t have a good understanding of behavioral finance either.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:37:46
I never claimed to be an economist, apparently you aren’t reading (see how annoying and easy this is)! I said I have training in economics. Excessively emotionally invested and emotionally invested aren’t the same thing... not sure why you would even bring that up. 
Bitcoin doesn’t have any intrinsic value whatsoever. It will almost definitely always be around, but it will be just as obsolete as it has always been. Serving a tiny niche market for mostly black market transactions. Maybe that will Change in the future but you have absolutely no proof or resources that COULD say such.
The only evidence needed,  to prove that it isn’t a currency, was provided originally, OH MAYBE YOU WERENT READING LOL. One more time for you, IT ISNT A STORE OF VALUE. You can run off believing what you want but that is just a fact. 
Also, bitcoin can and easily could be replaced. You must really enjoy the perception of reality you’ve created, feeling all cozy about your safe bitcoin investment. All the while remembering how much money you’ve already lost. Must be nice, having Cognitive Dissonance always hanging around with you! I’ve heard he’s a cool guy!
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:04:08
No, I’m really not. You didn’t really invalidate anything that I said, you just tried to make yourself seem like a superior life-form, whilst trying to shit on me. Seems like you’re mad about something, but there is NOOO way I could be right about you being excessively emotionally attached to bitcoin. You definitely established that. /s
It’s not a currency and won’t ever be. Go kick rocks somewhere else.
