I'm 24 now and thought it was a sketchy and decided not to buy when I was in high school, on the regret

If you've done any of those things that you say people are addicted to then you'd know it's will power and not just something that is impossible to stop.

I think you cleared up a lot of things for me. Thank you. Even with that said, with the NSA trying to over stretch their boundary I can't help but think they will try find every ounce of evidence possible to find the usage of bitcoins. It's fucked, but I can totally see this happening. I understand fully where you're coming from though.

wow not even a day ago, I guess I should of looked first before posting. Thank you though for your comment

That's exactly what I mean! I'm not saying I don't want to do it if my government doesn't like it, fuck them and everything they stand for. I'm saying if I throw money out there and this dipshit's are able to make bitcoins illegal there goes my entire investment.
Not even illegal. Maybe they confiscate all of it deeming it whatever excuse they can find, there goes all the money I put into it.
That's what i'm saying.

I'll look into bitcoin-qt and the offline wallet, is that through through bitcoin-qt or is it completely separate? The reason I asked about the mining is cause I read an article the other day that said how it is possible to make about 2,500 a year mining with a fast computer and internet running 24/7 all year round. Does that sound possible? 
Thank you for the help. I know it's a lot of questions.

That's the problem, what's holding them back from confiscating everyone's investment saying it's no longer theirs since... that's kinda what government is known for now and days.

Where do you have your wallet through? I'm a little cautious about using coinbase, what do you suggest? 
And also, how and where can I start mining too? 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:15:20
Coinbase is what I was thinking of doing. What about the open-source software though? Is coinbase better to use or are there different qualities of both?

Simple and relieving answer. I like it, thank you.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:41:33
I'm sold. haha, thank you very much.
Could you direct me in the right direction to get started? I'm lost with the ins and outs of this stuff
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:30:49
Yea I knew the silkroad did all their transactions through bitcoins, and then thought after collecting so much money the feds would decide it shouldn't be illegal. That's relieving though knowing they can't access your stuff though
