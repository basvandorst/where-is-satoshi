Exactly. It is amazing how much faith New York is putting in a proven poor system over a new safer system.

Sorry but this is pathetic insurance. I do not want  insurance on the 3% that is not in "vault" ..think about that.. they are insuring that which they don't put in vault. Why would an insurance company not offer a good rate on the vault coins..this is public relations...any coins they hold should be insured. ..if they can't do that..why would i leave my coins with them instead of under my own control..They are not going to reimburse you if coins taken from vault..and that is where 97 percent of their coins are. Think about it ..if a hacker were to attack an area which one would they attack ?

The suggestion in the article that if NY passes bitcoin license law ,non US exchanges will do business with NY, is ridiculous. All you have to do is read what they have said. As the head of international operations  for OKCOIN said , the proposals are" ...absurd unreasonable and overreaching " and indicated they would not comply with the rules that forced them to keep records on people who never been to new york , never planned to go to new york , have no nexus to new york, and hence would simply not offer the exchange to new yorkers.  Furthermore ,the idea that individuals can not trade bitcoin among themselves but could go to jail  if that did not  go through exchanges (that required photo ids) would somehow be acceptable to holders of bitcoin is out of touch.  Bitcoin operates in a world that the author of this article is ignorant of .

good point

You are correct . There are no safeguards against an entity that was prepared to lose money. Which if there goal was to take down bitcoin .it would be the cost of their army

I assume his coins are still in escrow so contact support, show your proof of payment and you should get coins. With that said I think in person meeting for cash exchange is always the best. Just do it in a very public place,.i.e. Starbucks and you should be fine

He is correct and articulate. This is the poster child for poor regulatory control. The fact there was ONLY a 45 day extension suggests NYS is not really concerned what the bitcoin community cares about. This may spell the end of New York as the financial center..

Hopefully Coinbase and Xapo come out soon against the regulations. If they are silent it suggests that they are in favor of them and that would not be a good thing

I know of no feedback from Ben Lawsky. I worry that despite the long list of serious people who have asked for an extension of the deadline for comments he will not extend.

The reason in my view is that there has been serious negative news. The NYS license would if it was enacted as proposed and it became the template for most states ( which after the federal consumer agency negative comments) be the end of :
peer to peer trading
Circle has said they it would block ny ip addresses if only enacted in ny but could not comply with it
Certain miners would leave the United States.
The start-ups in bitcoin would vanish
and last but not least all information about what an individual did with his bitcoin would be in the available to the government.
That is a negative.
