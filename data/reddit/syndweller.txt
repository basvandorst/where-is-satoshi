@_date: 2017-02-17 18:25:29
Equities are a store of value.  I suspect that at least a portion of the price premium that is paid to buy a stock is because it is a store of value--of which there are limited competitors.  I suspect that this premium is roughly the amount of expected inflation or about 3% compared against the discounted cashflow of the company--so roughly 10-15% of most companies.  If people had a secure way of storing value that is inflation resistant then this premium should fall off.
This is a bit theoretically but I think it is accurate.

*citation needed*


You are correct in this point, and seem to grasp a concept that eludes many people.  As Krawisz explains in his recent [article](
*First I wish briefly to dispel the notion that money’s value derives from its use as a medium-of-exchange. Money is useful as a medium-of-exchange because it is valuable, not the other way around. This can be seen to be true by the fact that you can use money as a medium-of-exchange without adding to its demand. If you earn a bunch of money and then spend it again almost immediately after, you’ve used the money as a medium-of-exchange but you got rid of it so quickly that you have immediately negated the effect of demanding it.*
*In order for the value of money to go up, people have to want to hold more of it at a time or hold it for longer periods of time. In other words, the value of money is caused by its demand for use as savings instead. Someone can live hand-to-mouth and have only an amount of money they need on hand for the immediate future. Other people can have a large savings but still spend roughly same amount that they earn. Other people can spend less or more than what they earn in order to increase or decrease their savings. The value of money can be understood in terms of the reasons that make people want a lot of savings or a little, and changes to the value of money, both slow and rapid, can be explained in terms of reasons that change how much people value their savings.*

Since you asked nicely...
I recommend you develop an understanding of how money works.  If you do this you will be at a huge advantage to everyone else, because almost no one seems to have a correct understanding of money.  The particular issue in question is better explained by Daniel Krawisz in one of his articles from nakamotoinstitute.org, which I highly recommend you check out.  Daniel states:




Another way to think of the issue would be to imagine if everyone instantly spent their dollars as soon as they obtained them, the value would instantly become zero because no one would be holding them.  A currency's value is very much linked to people's willingness to hold it over time, without this demand there would be no value.

My first impression of the winklevii was from the movie the social network.  It is easy to think of them as the typical generational Ivy League douchebags that are born into wealth.
Since then I have seen how they talk about Bitcoin and it is rather clear to me that they are able to understand the situation correctly.  Not only were they able to understand that bitcoin would become very valuable but they understood *why* it would do so, which is far beyond even what many people on this sub are able to do.  They also understand the magnitude--that conservative "small case" for bitcoin would be $40k per coin.   This is just....correct.
In retrospect I think they are capable visionaries who can correctly forecast how complicated systems will play out.   It really is quite impressive and I have no problem knowing that they will be among the wealthiest people in the world after the global economy becomes fully Bitcoinized.  
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:54:42
Bitcoin beats gold because it's properties allows it to function more efficiently as money than gold or fiat could ever hope for.
Incidentally, fiat has also won the market contest against gold and would do so again; the only reason it is worth so much is because it continues to be miss-priced by gold bugs.  The price is very "sticky" but once it starts to drop gold will realize its true market value which will be close to zero.

This is actually correct!  For the short time the money is held there is extra demand.  Note that the article says "immediately after".  Any amount of time the money is held does increase demand though.


This is complete and utter nonsense parroted about by people who seem to love taxation.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  it WOULD make sense if government required payment of taxes AND then also did not spend those dollars but held them, but since government is by far a net spender of dollars the net effect is that it reduces the value of the dollar.


This is just false.  Also people/companies hold non-trivial amounts of currency.  Again, if they did not do so, the currency would be worthless.  The idea that transaction friction costs are enough to hold up ~4 Trillion dollars of value is laughable and absurd

The lesson should be to understand what you are doing and have a purpose for every trade.  If you analyze Bitcoin you should come to the same conclusion that I have that it's worth is substantially higher than it is at currently.  What sense would it make to sell something that is worth &gt;$1,000,000 per coin for $70, $500, or $1200 based simply on the unfounded speculation that you MAY be able to buy them back cheaper.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:20:06
I understand why it would appear that way to some people who look at the situation--gold has been an effective store of value for thousands of years.
But if you look deeper and ask the question why has gold been effective at storing value for 1000s of years and will it continue to do so in the future, you might come to a different conclusion.
Gold has been effective as a store of value because of its monetary properties.  Gold has competed against fiat in the marketplace and has at times lost but then surged when fiat inevitably falters. 
That was the past--and a new competitor has recently entered the battlefield, a currency that was engineered to have perfect monetary properties.  A world that has Bitcoin has no need for Gold (as a backup to fiat), or fiat itself for that matter.  
In a world where people can easily secure your money with cryptography, why would you need a money that requires expensive physical security?

That's how markets act, you dolt.  What do you think would happen--that the market price would behave in steady and predictable way if not for those darn DELIBERATE MANIPULATORS who **Cheat** the system to screw the little guys like yourself?
It's much easier to believe your failure is the result of a rigged system full of nefarious actors manipulating it all than to face your own inability to succeed.


My thesis, which is based on publicly available data and research is that liquid markets are very difficult to move--and that it would certainly take &gt; a few hundred BTC, I would estimate that it would take at LEAST 5K btc to have any noticeable impact on price.  AND also that if you were to try to use the $5k BTC to manipulate price to make a more attractive buy/sell point for yourself, that that advantage would almost instantly erode when you go to realize that market price.
In your simple mind you seem to think someone can sell a few hundred Bitcoin to make the price dive substantially then buy several thousand ON THE CHEAP, screwing over little guys like you.
You're just a goddamn idiot who thinks you know what is "really going on here" and everyone else can't see it.  The truth is you're just a fucking moron who can't think through even simple economics to understand not only does this "manipulation" not happen, but it could not happen.

I had a similar argument with a friend who would claim that no one invests in dollars.  First off, if no one invested in a currency, that currency would necessarily be worth nothing.  The only reason dollars, or any currency including bitcoin has ANY value is because people are willing to accept and hold it  (use it as a store of value).  Also, companies that one might invest in ARE holding cash themselves on their balance sheets.

If you plan to hold long term, then there are no taxes (as long as you don't sell), so this seems like a moot point to me. 
Perhaps there would be some advantage in buying through a Roth IRA with taxed funds, and then later when withdrawing moon-sized bitcoins you would pay no (additional) tax.  But by that point government could very well change the rules and/or seize your bitcoins since you can't hold the private keys with the ETF.

It amazes me how much authority-loving surfs will defend inflation.  I think a lot of their confusion comes from 
not understanding what inflation is, which I think is due to deliberately misleading terminology.
When I use the term inflation I mean to refer to monetary inflation--e.g. the expansion of the money supply.  There is a thing that some people call "price inflation" but this is just really a market fluctuation of prices.  Prices go up, and prices go down; over time one could expect prices to decline due to increased productivity and technology--this has nothing to do with inflation.
People often speak of inflation as being 2-3% or so, but this is very inaccurate.  This is some jumbled number that factors in monetary inflation AND prices falling due to productivity increases.  Suppose an economy improved its inefficiencies to the point good and services costs 3% less, but then the monetary supply increased ~6%.  Inflation would be reported as +3%, with the reality hidden and the productivity gains obscured under this shroud of malicious ambiguity. 
In any case, I try to avoid engaging with state sycophants on topics like this.  If they don't feel inflation is "bad" they are welcome to store their value in an inflationary currency.  It's better for me if they do as it shifts wealth from the state-lovers and the freedom-loving libertarians.

Who actually pays you for those dollars you're holding?
I think most people have the wrong idea about money.  Money is a tracking system or ledger and the individual units are worthless except for the token-aspect they have in representing a portion of that ledger.  This is also true for gold.
That is what money does--it is a tool for tracking altruism or favors.  Bitcoin preforms this function FAR better than any other money could ever hope to as a consequence of its incorruptible monetary properties, as such it follows that people will value it more and more until it is the only currency that is needed or used.

Agree with you on this and the technical aspects that give rise to the monetary properties.  My understanding of a "worst-case" would be BU forks off and attacks the BC chain; BC changes POW in response, and then you have two distinct chains and lets say BU becomes super centralized and BC fumbles the initial POW and has to do some emergency HF fixes,  whatever. 
The end of all this mess the market will pick the superior chain, even if it takes a while to do so--suppose it initially chooses BU, but then a few years later the the Chinese governments starts censoring transactions somehow--then the smaller BC chain is still there and the market can choose it.
If Bitcoin can be wrecked by reckless or even intentionally malicious action then it's ultimate value is zero.  If it can't be destroyed the value is much higher.  Let's hurry up and find out which it is.  Lets fork and change the POW.

No he is not.  Buffet and other smart guys have not studied Bitcoin and that is fine.

He proclaims himself to be an expert on monetary policy but he does not even fully understand what monetary properties make a currency valuable.  He goes on and on about gold having "intrinsic value" whatever the hell that means.  The best I can gather is he is really referring to gold's non-monetary utility that is derived from its metallurgical properties.  He mistakenly thinks this is essential for gold to function as money when in reality it is a hindrance and a distraction.
I do not want a money that has non-monetary utility.  Money is a ledger or tracking system and the individual units of currency are tokens to that end, nothing more.  To suggest that currency tokens MUST have non-monetary utility to function as money reveals the true breadth of Schiff's ignorance about money.

I get 1% cash back when I buy a property, so if I buy a 100k condo w/ 20% down it works out to about a 20k investment depending on which financing I go with, but then it drops down to 19k when I get the cash back.
It makes sense to make a long term decision based on this bonus, as it can really make or break the ROI.

Your lack of ability to imagine is not a constraint on economics or reality
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:23:27
Indeed.  I am here because I ^(^feel ^like ^I) understand economics.  To me it seems like anyone who understand economics should sell most of their cash for Bitcoin, and yet in this community that has formed around the world's first perfect money, the amount of economic ignorance is astounding.
I do not understand why Bitcoin is not already &gt;$10K/btc as a result of a mad land grab from Austrian economists.   Maybe someday people will realize the value of an incorruptible ledger that is immune to state interference,  but the market sure has not clued into this notion yet.

Indeed.  And for the entire history of gold it did not have competition from Bitcoin--A store of value that is far easier to secure/transport/authenticate/and has a more fixed supply.
Perhaps it is Bitcoin that will put an end to Gold's long term history as a SOV.

Fellow Ron Paul supporter here.  I was a national delegate for him in 2012 in Tampa.  Seeing the RNC shenanigans up front lead me to conclude that we can never achieve liberty through political means.  
Fortunately soon after I found Bitcoin and I believe that we can reach our goal of liberty through economic means, as Bitcoin erodes the ability of the state to function beyond the amount of taxation the populous will allow.   That is, sound currency and a large war-mongering state are mutually exclusive.
In liberty my friend.

Before you understand Bitcoin, you really need to understand economics and money.  I recommend some deep thinking as to what makes currency valuable and what properties the best money would have.

If you are asking those questions then you are on the wrong path.  It is important that you first understand money.  If you cannot fully understand why gold (and things like seashells, etc) became the dominate currency in the past then you have no business getting involved in Bitcoin.  
How convenient it is to use to make a purchase is such an irrelevant aspect of Bitcoin.  I suspect that in a few years the only bitcoin transactions will be large ones.  Understand what Bitcoin offers that no other currency does before you start asking the questions you are asking.

Neither of these two things are fraud.  Who do you claim they are defrauding?   "Fake" (as decided by you) volume is not fraud.  If you make decisions based on the number of transactions reported then that is your own issue--and also I don't think it matters whatsoever.  Naked shorting is also not fraud if the two parties to the transaction agree upon the terms and are not deceived.

haha there are lots of laws that make no sense or are unnecessary as the free market imposes an appropriate and sufficient penalty; consider sex or race discrimination--these things are illegal but if someone does them even if they were not illegal they would most certainly lose money.
Im sorry you think market manipulation can be done, but if you do, then I suggest you go forth and do it to profit from it; especially considering that Bitcoin cannot be effectively regulated.
So the real question is, given that you think this is possible, WHY ARENT you doing it succesfully?

Are you a dumb person?  That is not what im talking about.  Just because the ROI is the same does not mean everything else is the same.

newcomers today and yourself as well. Just something to consider.
I think the majority of people who earned a lot of money during the early days of Bitcoin did not do so because they had a good understanding of monetary principles.  If you are one of the few who understands why bitcoin is a superior currency and put the effort into figuring out how this will all play out, then that is awesome.   We may have gotten in at different times, but I think we might both be in this camp.  Ver, IMO, is not.  He does not seem to have a good understanding of why Bitcoin is a superior money and he seems to have stumbled into Bitcoin rather than from drawing the right conclusions about it through having an understanding of money.
Voorhees and the Winkivii are a couple of good examples of people who are in Bitcoin because they get it, not because of luck.  But people like Ver, and Karpeles...IMO that is luck.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:06:40


I would argue that buying Bitcoin without understanding it is luck.  It is the equivalent of someone buying Netflix stock without a correct understanding but rather some either wrong or poorly thought out reasons vs someone who did the analysis to correctly understand the situation then take a very calculated risk.
It comes down to really understanding Bitcoin currencies in general.  Many people are very very wrong on this and make all sorts of absurd claims such as buying Dogecoin, or Ethereum, some of these people who have no clue what is going on buy Bitcoin for the same reasons.  I consider this very different than people like myself and I presume you as well who invested the time and effort to figure this strange new world out.
Btw, I see Bitcoin becoming the dominate world currency; hyperbitcoinization and all that.  Time will soon tell if we are correct in our analysis

I don't really care much about Nazis.  There are a lot of groups of people that have shitty views, but without power--real political and economic power, these groups are no threat at all.  
SJWs and liberals in general who want to ban "hate speech" are a *real* threat to me.  Free speech is liberty I place a lot of value on, and if the state allows the restriction or censorship of that liberty then we have all lost something of tremendous value.
So, yeah, I hate SJWs more than a bunch of Nazis who would like to be a real problem if they had power, but never will.  Instead they are a canary in the coal mine for free expression.
