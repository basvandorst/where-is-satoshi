So together they were billionaires. But not individually? 
Let’s start combining net worths with 1000 others and say “we are billionaires”

A village is smaller than a town. Villages range in pop from a few hundred to a few thousand, 40,000 dwarfs that.   
 here are your villages in japan.  
 and china. 
As a chinese american living in japan, that has seen many "villages", i encourage you to click those links and tell me what population stats you find.
I do appreciate the lesson on relativity.

Haha yesss. I bought around 3200-3300

Except if you wanna buy now you have to use coinbase. Gdax fund transfer in would take 9 days or so. Prices could go back up. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:25:22
Right now is a very good time to buy in, we all believe. Prices may go back or, or further down. For me, I wasn't willing to wait, so I paid the fees on CB today to buy in at this low. 
If I waited to deposit into gdax, it would've taken 9 days. Maybe your bank had a quicker transfer ? I'm with chase.

100% agree with this. 
At this stage in crypto, I don’t care what coins do better or worse, I just want all of crypto to succeed in a proper way that isn’t full of massive hype, followed by fud.
