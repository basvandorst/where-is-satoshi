If you add coin to coin trades, I'd be all over VoS like a fly on a rib roast.

don't feel bad.  I'm a grown adult and highly educated and just learned about 3 years ago that "for all intents and purposes" wasn't "for all intensive purposes".  felt special that day.
I do not yet have enough wealth in BTC to justify anything like you have, but someday could see that being the case (hopefully).
Why backed with tinfoil? can you explain the need?
Also, how do you generate those key pairs?  I'm assuming that if you're doing a double-set of docs, with an attorney, you're using an offline computer with bit address or something loaded up off USB.  Thanks for your insight.

which by definition would be necessary to make millions

not sure why you're down voted.  It is well known the FDIC is massively undercapitalized.  It's all a facade for the masses to feel safe about their deposits.  If there was a major bank failure, the Fed would have to step in and print, so by the time you got your money back from the "FDIC" there would be real concerns about its value.

serious question, as I'm relatively new to this.  People are big on the brain wallets, and even in your above post, you mention 12 or more truly random words.  But if you're going to print a paper wallet, couldn't you just type a bunch of bullshit (like 400+characters of randomness) into bit address's brain wallet, and then get your private key and use that going forward?
Simply put, is there a reason you couldn't just always use the private key as your "unlocked" to any public address?  I don't see a big difference between keeping a private key (printed off a printer) or trying to remember (and probably needing to write it down somewhere) a pass phrase.  am I totally off here?  thanks in advance.

nor is a "few", which is typically regarded as 3 of something, bitcoins purchased at $1000 a "much bigger risk" than an equivalent amount purchased at $1.  My point was his wording was sloppy, incorrect, and misleading.  Saying someone buying a "few" bitcoin at $1000 is taking a "much bigger risk" is false.  False because it could be the exact dollar amount equivalent, and false because now we have infrastructure for BTC, we're gaining global notoriety and acceptance, etc etc etc.  That was not true (or as true) when it was $1.

Gotcha, we're on the same page, although I missed your original note on the encrypted private key.  That's a layer deeper than I have.
I don't have much in BTC yet, but work in banking and economics and absolutely see the fundamentals there for a potential paradigm shift in global exchange/commercial exchange.  My knowledge aggregation now is to figure out "best practices" so that when I do have substantial wealth, I know how to handle it.
My thing with the random words is, most people can't remember a simple password, which is why they write it down.  The seed pass phrase for Blockchain was 27 words long!!!  Obviously they expect you to write that down, but even with the general brain wallet, I'd rather just have the private key, generated off a clean computer not connected to the internet, and maintain it on a paper wallet.  In the global scale of BTC, I'm not worried about someone breaking into the 130 year old bank and managing to get into the vault and get my paper wallet.  I am worried about my technology being compromised unknowingly though, and largely because to me, this stuff is really complicated, uses unfamiliar terminology, and functions completely differently than anything else I've ever worked with.
But that's what makes it exciting.  I'm learning new things, am excited to save/invest money into this, and recognize it's a 50/50 shot of adoption or abandonment after some period of time.  
And dice are awesome, I was reading all about those.  If I could remember the phrase I would feel comfortable with it.  If not, I'd have to write it down, and then at that point why bother, I'll just print out the private key.
Thanks for your detailed response!

it's "safe deposit box",  not "safety".  I don't mean that in a condescending way at all either, just thought you'd like to know.  kind of like there and their or "could care less".
and I keep my paper wallets in a safe deposit box too.  Figure that place has been there for 100 years with no issues, chances of it being robbed/destroyed by fire in the next year are next to zero.  plus I have other backups.

Seconded.  Yes you can still send funds to the address.  You just don't have the immediate availability or back up of those funds since they're in a paper wallet.

From the article:
"Which brings me to trust. All transactions must be based on trust, and it's hard to see how anonymous users making promises to each other can be trusted in the long term There is a genuine revolution underway in internet transactions. But bitcoin is a distraction. It's a classic bubble. Trust me."
HOO-LEEEEEE SHIT.
nothing about a bitcoin transaction relies on trust, in fact, the entire transaction process is designed exactly so you don't have to trust anybody!

yup crashed out for me as well.  not that it matters, first purchase locks me out until it settles :-(
