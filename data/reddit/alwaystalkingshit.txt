Wow bitcoin truly is the future!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:17:03
No. Only if you keep it on the exchange which is not recommended.

Also if you want to send it to a paper wallet for long time storage you're going to have to pay these ridiculous fees too. I sure as hell won't keep them on an exchange if i want to hold on to them for months.

Thanks for the response. 
What if there is a crash due to the government stepping in or something. (just an example) If you have your coins on your wallet then you will probably have to pay a ridiculous fee to get it on the exchange in a timely manner or you pay a normal fee and wait a few days because it will be clogged up. Not everybody has 10k invested in bitcoin. The higher the fees go the less people will be able to move them to a wallet. What if there is another mtgox? 
Sorry for any grammar errors english isn't my first language.

Yeah you can do that but you will have to pay a fee.

Dont be ridiculous. Memes are more important.

Oh look a btc cult member in the wild. How about you disprove his point? Oh wait you can't because these fees are real and the tx times suck too.

Thanks for the discussion. I too hope they fix this soon. I will keep my btc on my own wallet and if it somehow does crash then so be it. I only bought as much as i'm ready to lose.

The mods should change the header of this sub to: "bitcoin - the store of value of the internet". It's not a currency at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:20:42
You know that $3 is still a lot for a $40 transaction. Meanwhile i could use bch or xrb or like most of the other good coins to get a much smaller fee or even a free tx.

Bitcoin is destroying itself with these high fees and tx times
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:03:58
I'm on your side though. How is bitcoin better than gold if it has no use at all? Gold is useful at least. Dont get me wrong i hold some btc and i'm happy it's climbing up but that will have an end soon if the fees and the tx times rise with it. That's my opinion at least.

If you sell $1000000 worth of bitcoin you are not printing that money out of thin air. You get the money from the people that buy it from you.

By the end of 2018 not 17
