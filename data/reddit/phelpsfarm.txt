I love competition. I just think the Bitmain hate here gets a little pathetic sometimes.

7nm is a fools strategy where you throw money at the problem that you don't know how to roll efficient custom cores. $25 million in wafer cost vs. knowing what the hell you are doing and getting the same efficiency from 16-10nm.. If you have the money I guess.
@_date: 2018-09-30 06:59:14
Would you like to make a friendly bet that Bitmain is already mining with the 'S11' on 7nm around 2 months before they release it to the consumer market? Considering they ran S9 at their own farms and mvp customers almost 5 months before public sale I would say this is pretty much a lock.
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:08:35
Yeah, what could a billion dollar company that already has 7nm in hand possibly do to stave off a startup? /s
@_date: 2018-09-30 07:20:23
On a federal level (as of current) you are still required to disclose assets.
@_date: 2018-09-30 07:04:00
Absolutely, competition rocks. I am just surprised that there are multiple larger operations 'wasting' their money on 7nm when 14-16nm is 90% as efficient @ relative solve rate, offer a higher wafer yield, and cost under half of 7 nm. The only explanation I can find is that there are many projects that will pay the 'stupid tax' of over $15 million to push the envelope on density to not have to actually design an efficient gate design. 
Bitfury, or more specifically a single engineer within Bitfury is hitting the same efficiency as 7nm @ far cheaper and smarter tape out cost on 10-16 nm, and I think that's smarter.

I hate these articles. It's not news that you are required to declare assets. It's nothing new.

I'm not making an argument to change it, or proposing a 'more fair' model (though it would have been easy to simply use a model with ramp-up distribution rather than high initial block reward). My point is just that 'fair' is a relative term and claiming that Bitcoin was 'more fair' than another project isn't necessarily true.

Adam Back keeps slipping deeper into 'pathetic old man yelling at clouds' with Blockscam. Sad to see someone dump their BTC into a vaporware startup that couldn't even build what they set out to (didn't want to when they realized they couldn't make money on it).
@_date: 2018-10-10 00:06:57
How does knowing how anything plays out have any impact on whether the initial distribution was fair or not? It's not only cheating if you get caught.
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:13:58
Or treat a stake holder shit product for what it is. A desperate attempt to making money by a bunch of has-been's that couldn't build what they promised. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:15:14
Yeah, blockstream is such a 'great' company :)
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:00:56
Wait 12 hours for the MtGox-like crash when Bitfinex goes full retard. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 03:07:46
No you misunderstood. Bitfinex needed the money so they could 'maintenance' the hell to a country without extradition treaty. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 17:13:39
It's quite easy to argue that Bitcoin in fact has some of the most unfair distribution in the entire crypto sphere considering the fact that only a group of maybe 10 people had the technical know-how and access to mine for the first 2+ million coins produced. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 03:59:09
Relevant question. No idea. Though it is entirely possible of course to point out something that isn't the right thing without knowing what is. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 00:11:34
You could argue that. But with Bitcoin being literally created to become a financial system, and the only incentive to mine was a possible future value I'm not sure you could argue that it 'had no future potential value'.
@_date: 2018-10-14 04:50:55
How are they the biggest? Money laundering. Thats why.
@_date: 2018-10-14 04:29:25
If you think that this is 1.65 million different people and not maybe 200k people/company employees visiting 4-8 conferences each you will have a bad time.

Pretty sure this sub has been screaming 'bottom' since about $17,000 ha ha ha. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:33:42
1. That's market manipulation, and the SEC 'frowns' on it. 2. Why? 3. Nah.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:39:03
Oh look, it's the daily idiot post by people that think that holding an asset while it drops 80% is 'the best thing to do' just because over a 10 year stretch it has beaten the market. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 03:48:42
The entire team are basically mentally unstable, dat twitter..
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:34:09
Only people that don't understand trading think this is true. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:04:48
Yeah, sure am crying myself to bed over the Bitcoin/Litecoin I sold a year ago.  /s
@_date: 2018-11-03 03:44:49
Not sure why anyone thought Shrem was some kind of businessman or role model. He laundered drug money to fund his exchange, and then stole Bitcoin on his way to prison. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 03:47:28
Who needs to deep dive into anything to not trust the pubescent trolls behind that code-mess? Their twitter reads like the ramblings of mentally unstable children.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:37:38
4 hours later... down 18%

Tether was always nothing more than Bitfinex exit scam vehicle and a complete scam. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:10:28
HE can go fuck himself, and anyone who hasn't realized that he's a foreign asset with his own anti-USA agenda is pretty much retarded. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:38:34
Yeah, you sure are smart not selling at $10k+ and reinvesting... HODL! /s
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:15:22
Ironically, that tractor is probably about $200k so.. no
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:46:49
What if I told you that you have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:04:52
What does a goat need money for anyway? Poser.
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:33:50
Is there an option to just accept that Cryptocurrency is still in it's infancy and markets do what markets do without believing in crazy conspiracies? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:07:29
Imagine being so dumb that you think everyone bought Bitcoin for $4. Now THAT is painful.
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:04:09
Yeah, why settle for Craig Wright when you can go for the biggest most retarded conman of them all? 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:05:34
Lots of people bought GE @ $40 a share and no one talked them out of that. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:20:49
For someone trading a single asset that has appreciated in cycles over 1000x in 3 different bull run's it actually is pretty damn common.
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:35:16
Is it an asset that carries value? Then yes.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:04:25
No. Why would anyone do that? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 02:20:01
If you think that thinking long term it takes 'supernatural powers' to sell at an average of over $10k and buy back at an average of under $5k in the last market cycle I am worried for you.
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:13:11
What a surprise, a paid shill defending paid shills..
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:40:39
No it doesn't. The entire idea is absolutely retarded. Of course you CAN hold, you CAN hold anything but the idea that it's somehow better (and magically so in Bitcoin over other assets) than any other strategy is just an idiotic bet that history will keep repeating itself forever.

He's also batshit, so there's that.

Do you have a doctorate in making up numbers and claiming random shit?
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:15:14
Cause -34% is exactly the same as $20k to $3k. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:06:38
The concept of HODL needs to die. Those who haven't understood it's an idiot strategy needs to give up on 'investing'. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:03:36
Of course, I just figured that something was 'off' about the price since $0.006 would be 1/10th of low U.S. industrial rate and it seemed like the price expression was off.
