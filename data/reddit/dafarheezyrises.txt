Why do people keep saying "bitcoin community"?!
It makes us sound like a cult. 
Do you ever hear people saying "the dollar community"? Or the "Euro community"... if bitcoin is to rise to the ranks of these other currencies that's how ridiculous a phrase like "bitcoin community" should sound. I support bitcoin, but I'm not in your cult.

I'm just kidding. I don't know anything about Mark as a person... so i can't really say if he intends to commit a crime with people's money or if he is actually trying to resolve this issue. His communication has been crap though and everything going on with Gox is extremely shady.

First of all, easy money with little work sounds ideal for anyone.
But I hope we see $10K/btc sooner than 5 years so I can somewhat feel as good as the early bitcoin adopters did lol. I am also spending time learning about BTC and on weird crypto mailing lists / forums so why am I the lazy one? 
As far as my coding comment, I am just being realistic. I would love to work at some tech startup at Scillicon Valley, bitcoin or not, but all they hire are coders. It's either that or people with 7-10years of work experience if it's in the management area. So me being an Industrial Engineer, w/ 2 years of consulting experience, I feel out of luck that I can't even get my foot in the door. I could start learning to code now, but I am competing against CS majors who have been coding since they were 8 years old. So I'm extremely jealous of those fucks and I wish I spent more time learning to code.

I am actually in the process of applying for jobs in Oculus and bitcoin companies... I just want to have a career in that space. 
I have no development skills at all so being a dev is out of the question... too many nerds out there who've been programming since childhood, the competition is way too intense for me to get into that area now. 
Another thing I've been looking at are 3rd party companies, public companies, that are associated with Oculus or VR technology. Partners, suppliers, etc. Companies that will see a lot of money coming in if this technology is a huge success.

@_date: 2014-03-27 13:24:44
Thanks. What do you mean it takes a day to sync? My biggest fear is that I transfer money out of BTC-E to an offline wallet. The money leaves BTC-E but I dont see it get into my wallet and it just gets 'lost' in limbo.. maybe from some error or typo. Does this ever happen?
Also, do you keep any BTC in coinbase? I feel like they can't just lose your BTC and get away with it

Bitcoin's killer app is not privacy. The killer app has yet to come, it will be a platform that makes bitcoin incredibly easy and convenient to use. We are still in need of something along those lines. Privacy is a feature since day 1, and so its ability to transfer money without any boundaries which is even more important than privacy imo.

Im sorry for sounding arrogant, but isn't capital gains tax something ridiculous like 40%? Do we get any tax breaks for losing money in investments? If not I am not paying shit to the US gov. We are already getting robbed as it is with these ridiculous taxes and hospital bills, but it's even more fucked up that the gov demands a high % of my profit after I risk my own money when the gov takes absolutely no risk at all. 
If I make a lot of money on BTC I will put them all in a cold storage and withdraw the money away from the US if I have to. I'll just need to make sure I don't get reported by the exchange, but so far none of them asked me for my social security #

"Bitcoin was supposed to be a new, subversive alternative to a financial system that had been exposed as fragile, dangerous and too big to fail in the financial crisis of 2008. Instead, bitcoin and its purveyors now, too, have shattered the essential ingredients for a money system: confidence and trust"

But if everyone uses Venmo, if there is no transaction fee, and if Venmo doesn't act like dicks like PayPal does by locking your money.. what is the problem for being centralized? I understand the argument and why decentralized is better, but for the average person that's not gonna matter. At least with this centralized platform, you have fraud protection and customer service.
Venmo charges transaction fee form credit cards, not debit cards. And they charge merchants fees when they accept Venmo, but they don't charge consumers (unless they use credit card)
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:38:06
Yes it's entirely possible. I'm scared that BTC might be a 'pioneer' as it's referred to, but a pioneer that ends up staying a niche and doesn't get the adoption it deserves. 
I'm worried other platforms might take ideas and tidbits of bitcoin features and make payment platforms that actually succeed, even if it's not decentralized

I don't want stability until 1BTC is at least $10K-$40K.... we're only at $10B market cap, if bitcoin stabilizes NOW that means it stays around $10B market cap and that means it failed to get the global adoption it deserves.

@_date: 2014-05-08 15:55:03
You can't explain everything about bitcoin and how it works in your first sentence when explaining what it is. You need to start at the top of the pyramid giving a basic idea of what it is and then go into the details with follow-up questions. 
People try to explain everything at once and throw in some buzzwords like de-centralized, p2p, blockchain, cryptography, mining, etc and confuse the fuck out of everyone. 
I start with:
"It's basically a distributed database where the order of transaction is agreed upon by everyone in the network. This technology allows bitcoin to be used as a currency without the control of any 3rd party (ie. banks, paypal, etc)."  
Then they could say "Uhh.. how are transactions 'agreed by everyone' , what does that even mean?"
Then I can explain what bitcoin mining is... 
"Basically people use their computers to run a software that solves complex puzzles (called cryptography... hence the name crypto currency) which verifies every transaction that has taken place"....explaining this is the system which allows everyone who is mining to be a part of the network together, and keep track of a ledger which can be viewed by everyone... this is why bitcoin is considered de-centralized, global, and doesn't require 3rd party control.
Then I can explain more on mining and how bitcoins are released... i.e. Why would anyone mine bitcoins? (because rewards)... Then I can explain how btc mining also releases ___ # of bitcoins to the market every 10 mins, a rate which cuts in half after ___ years, and there will only be a limit of 21 million bitcoins ever produced (making it a deflating currency, this is meant to simulate gold mining hence the term "bitcoin mining")
"What is the point of using bitcoins when prices fluctuate so much? And why is the price so volatile?"
Explain the price depends on supply and demand, how the market cap is only about $6billion right now full of emotional investors who impulse buy and sell based on current events. How BTC still has a lot to grow and how most sites have USD/BTC rates programmed in that changes based on current price, so as a protocol for transferring $ it is great.
And THEN after all that garbage I can explain how the Blockchain as a technology itself is revolutionary and how its applications can extend more beyond just using it as currency.

I was hoping this was common knowledge and didn't need any explanation. But when I said that the first thing that came to mind is how banks silently practice transaction-shuffling. They will manipulate transaction orders to make sure the customer ends up paying an overdraft fee as many times as possible. And it's the lower income that ends up getting burned by this. This is one of the smaller examples too, I can give you more if you want.

This is a concern for merchants, not consumers. But ok. I am more interested in people adoption so the price increases (hey look i'm being honest abt the price, downvote me). Venmo seems to be adopting a lot faster despite merchant adoption, it's good for practical uses and convenience which I was thinking bitcoin was going to be.


Yes in theory they can. But is this really people's main concern? If people are being perfectly legal with their money Venmo legally cannot. People might point at Paypal and how they tried to keep people form buying bitcoin related stuff, that was just idiotic and they got in trouble for that, it makes no sense for venmo to get that kind of reputation. And people will not worry about this theoretical that a central agency will "steal their money if they want" when on the other hand they are getting fraud protection and customer support. 


And most people see bitcoin valued at whatever currency they are using it for, inflationary  or not. I don't buy your "the dollar sucks" argument, we live in America and the dollar is not going anywhere in the near future.


This is probably your most valid point about why bitcoin is superior. The protocol allows more than just it being a payment platform or currency. We just don't have the tools that take advantage of this yet. 


To merchants, not to consumers.

1. 1. Retailers don't have to sit and wait for every confirmation to happen, once BTC is sent it cannot be returned. Do you know that credit cards take 3 days to confirm? 
1. 1. Agreed but we are in the early stages, this is something that can get better over time.
1. 1. Forget the reaction and forget MtGox, we are still in the early stages and with no regulation and lack of security it's like the wild wild west with crypto. Again, this will change over time. Want to be an early adopter? You have to deal with the shit that comes with it. You judging bitcoin based on reaction form some idiots is ridiculous. 
1. 1. Same point as point  above... or was that the OTHER point  We are still in the early stages, there is currently NO regulation on bitcoin. People who are in the game now are still early adopters and there are risks that come with it. If you don't think that will change, that there will be greater legitimacy, security and infrastructure surrounding bitcoin in the future then you were NEVER a believer.

Point  and 3 are the same. I agree with point  and that is a plus for bitcoin. But the average person may not care like they don't care that VISA knows everything you do with your money.

He called me a fool for thinking his 10BTC would be worth $100K by 2016.... $10K/btc in 2 years is actually kind of conservative and because he called me a fool for saying that is why I responded the way I did.

Typical noob obsession. I was the same, still am actually but to a lesser degree. Looking at the charts constantly will not do you any good besides giving you the occasional headache. Keeping up with latest developments is good though because it helps you learn more about bitcoin overall. 
But right now you are only seeing dollar signs $$... I am too so a good advice for both you and me (easier said than done) is to not be bothered by the daily charts or the FUD being spread around here and just focus on learning more about bitcoin itself and its latest developments. 
Good things come to those who wait when you least expect it. We all want to make some money, but don't keep jinxing it... just step back and allow it to happen.

Sorry but I'm gonna say BULLSHIT on that one. How do you keep saying this stuff when there is evidence right in front of you that depicts the reality. There's no ifs and buts about this claim, there is evidence right here, take these recent examples: 
r/btc tries to have a discussion on SegWit vs BU: 
- NO talks about the merits of SegWit vs BU... top posts points fingers (it was Core's fault) and by default talks about censorship and pretends that Core and SegWit are all involved in censorship. Where is the actual discussion on the merits of both options? I don't see anything in that thread at all. 
r/bitcoin has a discussion about SegWit vs BU: 
- Actual discussion about both options. Plenty of posts that are against SegWit but where are the attacks?? Everyone is posting respectfully and talking about actual merits between the two options. 
This is a TOTALLY different conversation between the two subs which should tell you what the reality is. Stop pretending like r/bitcoin is the same as r/btc and making shit up like "anyone who opposes SegWit is attacked personally. Complete bullshit.... this is the type of lies that people in r/btc believe, the evidence is right in front of your face.

It sounds like you don't fully understand bitcoin yourself. When you explain it to someone just keep it simple. It's a digital commodity that can be used as currency. It's a currency like fiat, gold, sea shells, etc that we've used in the past... except it is the first *digital* currency, that can be programmed in may ways and layered on top of other applications unlike ever before. Using the internet/data, it can be sent instantly from person A to person B anywhere in the world. When you put $10 into a bank, the bank owes you a credit of $10...they don't have a vault for you with actual cash in it. When you send your friend $10 from your bank (bank X) to his bank (bank Y).. how is bank X going to convince bank Y that they now owe that friend $10? There is a lot of accounting involved in every day commerce that gets more complicated than this, which results in service fees and transaction delays. Bitcoin utilized a global public ledger and works in a way where you don't need a 3rd party to transfer payment from person A to person B. It's a digital commodity that "exists" thanks to the complicated nature of cryptography.... it's *there*, it has a set limit, it cannot be copied and no one has control over it (like how the central bank controls fiat inflow)...how is all this possible? How does someone not have "control" over a computer program/something digital? To answer this  you then get into bitcoin mining, the blockchain, and the consensus-based decentralized network.
I know this doesn't help for what you were looking for, sorry for the rant.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:29:56
And I know this isn't popular.... but I wish the Core Devs would CALM THE FUCK DOWN regarding UASF. The BU side were the extremists, now it feels like the Core devs are the ones who are unwilling to compromise. We are GETTING SEGWIT. We have 80% hashpower support + industry support. That's not enough because of a block size increase?  And as an alternative to a block size increase... we would rather have TWO chains that are both less secure? C'mon...

From where? What's a trusted site to created paper wallets
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:49:56
Because banks and other companies in financial services are middle men who take a bite out of the economy (via fees). They do provide services that can be worth those fees, but bitcoin provides an alternative where this third party is not needed. For the why... just look at Colorado's marijuana industry, banks refuse to deal with them and they can choose how they want to do business and who they want to do it with. People don't think about it because it never really affects them, until it does.

No it's not correct. Bitcoin is not a fad or a scam. When these people call bitcoin a bubble they're saying bitcoin has no value and is just waiting to go down under for good like one of those useless companies that disappeared after the dot-com bubble. I would argue bitcoin is still undervalued in the grand scheme, irrespective of the corrections that it has and will have along the way.

It will be though to get people to participate, and to get people to understand what they're voting on. 
Exchanges can help in getting people to vote though... Coinbase, Poloniex, Gemini, Kraken, etc can send their users and email alert with simple voting information and choices that get recorded on the blockchain. Even that would only get a handful of the ecosystem though. 
If we use our current state as an example for a voting scenario.... it's a given that everyone wants bitcoin to scale. But the question on how to scale gets messy. Good luck getting noobs to understand the difference between Segwit and FT.

Hi oldtimer, 
I agree with your assessment, all 3 questions are no (huge no's) so naturally I also believe the price will eventually be much higher as adoption continues. 
The only thing that worries me is that it seems like China is almost completely out of the game... or slowly getting out. China was the main catalyst that caused the price to soar above $1000, and since they were familiar with VC from the old days of QQ, they had the biggest mining infrastructure and the most enthusiasts... they were sort of like the forefront of this technology which helped give confidence to the value of bitcoin and to other parts of the world. Their population is 1/7 of the world and they have a huge economy... losing that market cap from bitcoin is not a small step back, it seems pretty bad imo. 
But still, like I said.. I do expect the price go to back up eventually based on your same criteria. The only thing that worries me is that it might take a long time to get back up after losing China. I'm talking all of 2014 and maybe all of 2015 if we are unlucky... and that would just bring down the optimism and assurance of bitcoin. Hold for that long is going to suck for a lot of us.

Some people believe that bitcoins will become mainstream, make significant changes to the world and/or at least increase in market share and demand by at least 10-100 fold. If this happens the current price of bitcoin is a bargain compared to where it can go in 2-5 years. Do some research in bitcoin and if you understand its value and believe in this technology, then you should invest and it is definitely not too late. Put in as much money as you can afford to lose in the small chance that it fails and becomes worthless. So in my opinion, I don't think it's too late.

Bitcoin still has utility. It solves a number of real-world problems, and if it grows large enough, it may solve more. It's still in its infancy so the benefits are not clear to most people.

OP, if you are under the age of 30, single with no kids and aren't struggling with debts then I would personally do it. I have put in all my savings into it last month (may not have been smart, but we will find out) and I'm still trying to buy as many Bitcoins as possible with each dip in price and each paycheck.
I think we're still in the early stages and there is a bright future for bitcoins. At this point we are still ahead of wallstreet, hedge funds and other huge players jumping into Bitcoins, after that happens I'm sure there will be another huge wave of people and money coming in because at that point it will look more legitimate and less risky to the average joe. 
Here's some of the good news that happened just this week that still hasn't caught up with the current value yet, but will:
1. Switzerland voting to make Bitcoin a foreign currency
2. Baidu (china's yahoo) adding a section for bitcoin in their main page
3.  adding a bitcoin logo on their main page (their high traffic, along with baidu's will definitely help increase awareness)
4. News about WallStreet and hedge funds getting into bitcoins in 2014
5. Fidelity allowing customers put bitcoins in IRAs (even though only for rich customers, still a great step forward for bitcoin's image and awareness, and more money going into bitcoin is a good thing) 
So I'm very optimistic and I would do it if I were you. But remember, this is YOUR money so don't get blindly hyped from someone random from the internet. Do your research, follow your guts and take a risk if you think it is worth taking.
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:33:32

@_date: 2013-12-18 06:13:29
Bitcoin is meant to increase in value over time and is a good store of wealth. I think in the grand scheme user adoption is the first major step and then the 2nd step is merchant adoption. Once the market cap is large enough and enough people use bitcoin the crazy volatility will stop.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:09:41
so all the benefits of using bitcoin is also a scam? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:06:54
Well no one can tell the future so I understand why people say invest what you can afford to lose when they are talking to a newbie. Because there IS a risk. But I am with you, i invested my life's savings in bitcoins. I figured im young enough to take a risk and if I win I might as well win big.. this is the only way I can accumulate a lot of money at a young age if things go well.

Another GARBAGE article by a moron with little knowledge of bitcoin. I couldn't take this seriously after reading these lines:
"Central banks, too, are a form of technology. Like other technologies, they’ve improved with iteration. Since the establishment of Sweden’s Riksbank at the end of the 17th century, central banks have been trying out new strategies, watching each other and copying what works." 
--These strategies involve keeping people in debt and increasing profits by sucking everyone dry out of their money.
"Fiat currency is a highly adapted tool. Inflation isn’t a bug. It’s a feature."
--lol... just, lol... shut the fuck up you fucking idiot
This guy argues bitcoin is only good for storing money, but fails to realize the importance of the global network it creates that gives people better ways to use their money.

Both. I think Bitcoin has utility and solves a number of real-world problems that are not apparent to most people yet since it's still at an early stage. I'm rooting for bitcoin to survive because it's beneficial to the public and businesses of all sizes. It only hurts the "bad guys" (banks, credit cards, fed reserve, governments who want control.... literally the "thieves" of our world). At the same time it's a risky investment that can either turn south really fast (like we're in now) or exponentially increase your wealth (which we still don't know). This is why I jumped in, I believe in this technology and I want it to become mainstream for the benefit of society.. and I also like "big risk big reward" situations.. it adds some sort of excitement. 
About the dude buying a Lambo with bitcoin.... wow that merchant must be pissed. Because based on the price right now they sold that car for $150k cheaper! lol... but hopefully they will hold.

I think the way it works is a customer pays the dollar value of the item, in bitcoins, the system calculates how many bitcoins that will be based on the current price, then the merchant gets the fiat money right away from Coinbase or something. So they don't have to worry about holding btc or what the current price fluctuation is. 
Someone correct me if im wrong

I agree with this

The real question is... is it called Dog Coin? Dog-e-Coin? or Doge Coin? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:59:51
Bitstamp is easier and more user friendly. But I suggest buying on both. 
BTC-e has other alt coins and the 'troll box' live chat is very entertaining

females don't bother about making money on their own... they only care about marrying a guy who's made millions off of bitcoins

You answered your own question. "I don't really know much about bitcoin"... if you did you may wonder for yourself how it can change the way we use money for the better.

Oh WHY did I spend $3400 buying Zynga stocks instead of Bitcoin in 2012.... My life would have been completely turned around by now. I hate being reminded of this.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:54:25
Wait til tomorrow and just buy it and hold and don't look back for at least a year or two
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:33:52
I dunno what I was thinking about zynga to be honest. I was looking for a quick profit and ended up waiting and waiting until it just kept going down. Couldn't get myself to sell at a loss.
But i'm gonna sell zynga and use it to buy more BTC.... and i want to collect as much as I can while it's low and hold on to it. I still have a positive outlook in BTC. Maybe my luck will change by 2015
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:40:52
I have to wait til the 31st to get my next paycheck that I can use to buy bitcoin... by then it may either go up a lot or down a lot
I have enough to buy 1 right now but I hate buying 1 at a time and paying a transaction fee
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:00:55
I think it's good to own at least 1 whole BTC
Do you think BTC will reach $100k to a million?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:54:28
Bitcoin is here to free us!

Hey man, I would recommend reading the satoshi paper multiple times to get a grasp of how bitcoin works. It can be confusing to start with, because there so much to it and how it opens the world to a lot of new innovations regarding money. You also need to understand how money works, where its value comes from, why credit cards, banks and international transfers require transaction fees, etc to fully understand the advantages of bitcoin. Once you get a solid grasp of it yourself, then try to explaining it to people. It took me a week of research to develop a solid understanding of bitcoin and how this completely topples the centralized money system we are under today.

Yeah man, all my liquid savings, which is not much LOL (i'm 25).  I bought bitcoins when they were $670 each 3 or 4 weeks ago, and i'm holding on to 10 bitcoins which are worth around $8500-$9000 now. Fixing to buy 2 or 3 more while the price is around $800. I'm going to hold on to all of these coins for the whole year of 2014... I easily expect the price to break $1500/$2000 in 2014.... in fact, if it doesn't go up much higher by the end of 2014, it would be a major disappointment in the bitcoin community. 
I really think we are still early and most people simply just don't get it yet. If we learn about this technology now we will be ahead of most people. In the end no one can predict the future, but the way I think about it is that if you want a big reward you have to take the risk... you can't expect to win big by playing it safe. And in my opinion, this is the kind or risk that makes sense to me and it's exciting.
