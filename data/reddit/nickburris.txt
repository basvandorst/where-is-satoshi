Don't let the title fool you, it's still CNBC, of course the article mentions the 25% price drop from the ATH

Good news, it's open source! You can see the development being done for yourself on GitHub. It could use more developers, same as any open source project, but it's far from abandoned.

Merchants today don't want to touch the chain. They want services like bitpay that do it for them. So in reality, you'll have users sending microtransactions to bitpay (or better alternatives) via LN, bitpay pays merchants USD if they want, and bitpay can daily withdraw from LN to cold storage or whatever they need. Of course, you'll have more interested merchants setting up LN wallets themselves (especially as it gets easier), but even if they do want to cash out daily (which might not even be necessary in a world where their produce supplier also accepts LN payments), there will be BTC/USD exchanges that accept LN, since they have incentive for running an LN node.

Sure. You could create a diagram of the current BTC distribution among active addresses, and I bet LN will look a lot like that, so of course there will be "super nodes". Why is this a problem? Well, you could say the problem arises when you have people who only have one channel open, with a large node, and it goes offline. Your average user doesn't understand what this means and why, and they don't care, they just want it to work. So, we'll have wallet software that automatically handles LN channeling, opening channels to historically reliable nodes, and reopening when necessary. With LN adoption, reopening channels won't happen that often as we'll have reliable nodes and redundancy in the network.

Higher network hash rate does not mean transactions are processed faster, so yes, the most likely cause is fewer transactions. There has also been some evidence of spam attacks that could be giving up, but there's no way to prove this.

Does block time deviate enough from 10 minutes to have that much of an effect on transaction times? It'd be interesting to look at average block time for example in the 24 hour periods before each difficulty adjustment, but I can't find a website that displays that data nicely.

Considering what we saw when coinbase went offline, we'll see a much bigger impact if they start order batching and using Segwit, so right now we're just seeing low volume because of the weekend and lower interest after the recent price dip.

Why not Google auth?

1) A fork is just an update to the rules that are used to validate transactions. We actually "fork" all the time, whenever there are changes to the rules, however if they're rules that we all agree on then the old fork disappears. In the case of bcash and other coins that we call forks, there was a change in rules that a significant amount of people didn't agree on, so when the rules came out (ie double block size for bcash) both forks lived because both had support. 
2) It's weird to think about why the forked coin is worth anything, but yes, one way to think of it is the thought that it will become the "new" Bitcoin. In a way, they take their value out of the value of Bitcoin, because if nobody supported them then there would be that much more demand for Bitcoin and it would be more valuable. So even if one doesn't ever become the new Bitcoin but continues to be used, it still has value, the same way any altcoin has value. 
3) When you own the private keys to your wallet and the blockchain forks, both chains report you having a balance. So you can spend your Bitcoin balance, but the forked chain, for example bcash, still reports your old balance that you had at the time of forking. If your coins were stored in an exchange at the time of forking, that exchange has your coins in both forks as well, and can choose to give them to you if they want to, but there's no way to make them do so. 
4) There will be more forks in the future, and it's not guaranteed that exchanges will give them to you, so yes if you want to make sure you get those coins so you can sell them off for a little extra value, you should store them in a hardware wallet (or anywhere that you own the private keys). In fact, as I'm sure you've read, you shouldn't be storing your coins on an exchange long term anyway.

Yeah, definitely do some research first. A Ledger is best but costs money, I prefer just using a paper wallet but you have to be sure that you're doing it correctly. There's lots of information out there though, good luck!

No, with coinbase's current fees (which are even higher than normal BTC fees because it's coinbase) it wouldn't be worth it if it's a big chunk of your Bitcoin. I don't really pay attention to forks, it would only be a substantial amount if the fork is worth something and you want to go through the effort of exchanging it. 
If you want to be safer with your coins though, and put the effort into getting future fork coins, I'm pretty sure you can withdraw from coinbase for free by transferring your BTC to gdax (free because coinbase owns it) and then withdrawing from gdax (free) to your wallet where you own the private keys. I haven't done this myself so I could be wrong but look into it.

Weird, I assumed logging into my Google account on the new phone would show the previously added code generators. So I have a few things already in Google auth, can they be moved to authy?

My computer runs 24/7 for mining, so I could get the core wallet and run a node. Does running a node use a lot of CPU or network bandwidth? I wouldn't want either of those factors to slow down mining.

I don't have any ATMs around me but as far as I know different ATMs do it differently. Some print out a QR code for you to scan with your app, which is a private key that your app can sweep the coins off of, then you'd transfer it to your paper wallet if you want. Of course, then you're paying 2 transaction fees. Maybe there are some ATMs that just scan your public address and pay you that way.

Nice trade! Just sounded funny with BTC current price :-)
