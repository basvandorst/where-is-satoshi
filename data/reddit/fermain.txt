Or we would have everyone using services like Blockchain.info, which whilst far from ideal, avoids the 3rd party having control of the private keys.

If you want an idea what dumping this many coins onto an exchange will do, take a look at this: 
3000 coins cleared through all of the bids on BTC-e in no time, forcing the price down to $100 for a second.

Just to be clear, I don't disagree with you necessarily I was just adding to what was saying. I like bits, I can think in bits, and I think its not a horrible way to go - but I can just as easily think in millis and micros. I can't say I'm hugely torn over this issue as I would be happy with either outcome (or an unexpected third outcome perhaps), but I find it interesting. It's part of the nature of the currency, no central agency to decide these things, so the community is doing the 'hashing' on which ideas are best. 
I trust that we have a decent amount of mental hashpower as a group.
E: For what it's worth, I don't think any more decimals will be added so I see it as a bit of a moot point.
E2: Apparently 'moot point' means either relevant to discussion, or not relevant to discussion depending on which country you're in. Dammit English.

It is pricey, 0.45 ($ I presume) per unit, and this is actually how the company that runs the mine makes their money, as they do not own any shares in the venture themselves. I think there is a sister company that provides on site solar power to the mine, but I have no idea what percentage comes from that. It would be nice to have 100% solar power and add more panels as part of the reinvestment % so that those costs come down over time.
@_date: 2014-10-28 13:48:20
On moving the decimal: From what I understand it wouldn't be a case of making 1BTC 1mBTC, rather 1 Satoshi into 100 Sub-Satoshis. If, for example, BTC:USD price had reached such a height that even the Satoshi was becoming an unwieldy minimum unit, it could be subdivided. The value of the unit wouldn't change, there would be no more BTC in circulation, but you would have more space to make smaller transactions.

They converted the loan amount to a certain amount of shares valued at 0.0075 (from memory), this is quite a bit above market rates so that's them being optimistic.

What else is new.
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:42:40
Lets say I bought NEOBEE shares with a $500 Bitcoin at ~0.0033 per,  300 total for simplicity. 
The share price has since risen to 0.005 per, and the BTC price has risen to ~$650, therefore on the books, a $500 investment is worth about $975.
Now: A more interesting case - RENT (RentalStarter). This is a property letting company, so all of the assets, and the income, are denominated in USD, even though the shares are in BTC. As the BTCUSD exchange rate goes down, the value of the assets represented by the shares stays the same. This means that the shares become worth more in BTC terms as the rate goes down. 
If I buy 180 shares at 0.0055 each (1 BTC total) when BTC is at $650, and the exchange rates goes down to $325, *in theory* my shares should now be worth 2 BTC, since the assets they represent haven't decreased in value, but the currency they are denominated in has. Whether or not this actually works remains to be seen, but I have bought some as something of a hedge.

There are a few threads over on that go into this in detail, from what I understand the 3rd party trading software platform MT4 seized up during the madness, and locked a load of people with open short positions out, when the price hit the bottom they obviously wanted to close these positions, but couldn't until it had returned to ~650, costing some people upwards of $70,000.

I don't think any government is required to change, and I don't think we need to wait for anyone to die.
Decentralised applications *will* in many cases exist despite their government counterparts. As they mature, they *will* in many cases become more effective or efficient at delivering their service. As this happens, the population will (slowly) begin to default to these services and the wind will gradually be drained from the sails of the current operators.
Do we expect everyone to switch to Bitcoin immediately? Of course not, they will do so slowly, one by one, as they find an application where it provides them with a better alternative to conventional payment. This will happen when bitcoin is mature, and that may take years still.
In the case of voting, small local governments have already begun to use decentralised voting systems in the UK on a trial basis. Perhaps this will be the direction of change, where these systems 'infect' the status quo from the local level upwards until a point comes where we ask 'why hasn't the central government switched over yet?'. Alternatively, one could set up a 'shadow' legislature using such a network and perform a sort of 51% attack on our representative government's democratic mandate by achieving a level of participation above that found in most countries' elections. For the most part this shadow legislature would do absolutely nothing, but it would undoubtedly serve as a powerful influence as it grew in size before crossing a critical mass.
**TL;DR: If these systems are going to replace what we have already, it might happen 'by accident' or 'without us noticing'.**

Yeah, but the bitcoin price drops whenever there is negative news. I think people are confusing the price drop from flooding an exchange with volume and the price drop from people getting jumpy. If someone offloaded a few thousand bitcoins on any of the markets, it wouldn't dip the price by $30 over an hour, it would hammer it down to $100 in 5 seconds.

I made a very fleeting comment about something like this on this subreddit the other day, nice to see other people are thinking along the same lines!
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:03:19
I don't know how this pertains to me. I'm in the UK.

He's talking about BTC withdrawal not fiat.

I'm surprised to see that this hasn't been posted on this sub yet. It appears that almost 40k has been taken from the site in a massive organised scam. Information is a little hard to come by, by the nature of these markets. 
[This guy]( has a lot of information, it's a bit difficult to read at times because of grammar/spelling, but he compiles much of the information that is floating around. 
I can't say much about the market, as I never used it, but what I have read suggests that the owners of the site stopped withdrawals due to a bitcoin tumbler they were due to bring online. Meanwhile, well established vendors began offering cut rate and bulk products in an attempt to attract more money to the site.
Hopefully someone with more experience of Sheep can shed a bit of light here.
Edit: Will post relevant links here:

What makes you think they are on SR2.0? And why is it so plausible that Tor has a backdoor?

I regret attempting to find the conversation. I went only so far before I had to turn back.

Good work, I've enjoyed this.

Take out your initial in fiat, then I challenge you to only ever spend the money on goods and services denominated in BTC. As you spend your money, you make it more valuable - even if it in the smallest way.
@_date: 2013-06-04 23:27:49
I don't care if someone is advocating for the state or not, or exactly what their politics are. I'd just prefer it if discourse was kept a bit more civilised. You might well be right, but we are all part of this experiment whether or not we believe that states are a good idea.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:48:37
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2013-06-03 13:09:37


Neither am I, I posted this information for interest. It's especially interesting seeing how people react differently to this and to bitcoin, the government tag does a lot to legitimise a service for most people even if it does the opposite for many in this community, such as myself.

I can't believe this guy gets downvoted in this sub of all places. There was a time where *you* didn't know about bitcoin tip, don't be so superior when someone asks...
Techno, a while back this was set up as a way to tip people in bitcoins over reddit. Go to  to read about it.

Yes, this is what I will be doing in Africa next year, simplifying the process to the cash-in-hand level, not really going heavy on the technical specifics (especially in computer illiterate areas), but rather the purpose and advantages of using bitcoins instead of, say, the Zimbabwe Dollar. The difference between me and Western Union (besides capital, expertise, experience, manpower), is that I can talk to people individually and actually present them with advice that is not 100% vested in my bottom line. It's not a big-bucks business model for me, but have other important incentives to do it, rather than a desk job.
I'll be back here in 2015 complaining about how I have no money, mind.

100 Satoshis = 1 Credit
1,000,000 Credits = 1 Bitcoin
I'm happy with this. It feeds the Sci-Fi in me.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:55:31
Here's an interesting thought. I assume that this guy has been tipped a decent amount on this sub, could the owner of this account be engaged in one of the most post-modern occupations of all time?
*So what do you do?*
*I wait until someone notifies me that I need to say "to the moon" on an online community and people pay me for it.*

Who cares about big time investors? I'd happily have them excluded from the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I expect you might meet some resistance for your dramatic flair, but as a piece of speculative fiction I enjoyed it. ~~Might want to edit Cyprus into its proper spelling, for polish.~~

Mt Gox is still in business and their accounts have not been seized, I think you're being dramatic.

Can everyone take a deep breath and talk like adults?
Bitcoin is a currency, not a weapon of war. I don't know about anyone else but I think the intense politics should stay in the anarchocapitalist (and similar) subreddits.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:17:08
This is the sort of thing that I need to know! Thanks will check on this.
