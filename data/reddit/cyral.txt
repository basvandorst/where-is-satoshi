This is different than then, every coin is down pretty much

Why? They are absolutely true. Too many people around here trying to pretend like the problem doesn't exist.

If you are going to day trade you need to use a real exchange. Even if you are good at day trading (don't recommend it), you will lose so much on Coinbase fees. Check out GDAX, it is the Exchange ran by Coinbase and it has no fees at all (unless you are using market orders). Use limit orders and you won't pay any fees.

Be careful using the buy wall to predict anything. Those buy orders can be canceled at any time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:50
In order for someone to buy someone has to sell so I'm not sure how there could be like no sell orders.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:08:53
Coinbase just uses photo ID verification so you should be fine. GDAX uses something like LexisNexis (large risk management and identity verification company) for Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering requirements, and LexisNexis probably won’t work until 3-6 months after.

That isn't what I said, but even so, look at the history of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:45:02
The size of the fee only has to do with the number of pending transactions and how big (in bytes) the transaction is, it is not a percentage of the size in BTC of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:48:24
60 minutes? Trading was only enabled on GDAX for like 2 minutes. I think some people bought using market orders which matched with some sell orders that got progressively higher.

Did he actually say this or are they just taking his tweet about the USPS out of proportion?

It hit 13.3 again, good to be back in the game
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:55
That isn't even Coinbase (they do have a small fee), it is the Bitcoin network fee. You would think people would do a bit of due diligence and understand what they are getting into but I guess not.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:40:27
Even if you turn 18 it may be hard to get verified on some exchanges. Coinbase has much higher fees than their exchange (GDAX), but GDAX requires extended verification which pulls from public records, credit info, etc, which is usually not available even for months after you turn 18.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:41:33
Still a better return than most investments.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:57:38
This is so fake. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:45:08


You missed a huge problem, that the network fee is making it too expensive to use Bitcoin as a currency

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:53
You can try but I would suggest not. I bought at 7.8k and sold on the way down back during the early November crash, similar to what we are seeing now. You will have a hard time predicting the bottom and will likely be better off just holding in the long run, every dip before has always recovered to be much higher.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:02
Bitcoin can't scale is the problem

GDAX has a 0.25% fee on takers and 0% on makers. What that means if that if you are putting a new order on the order book, you don't pay anything, but if you are matching with an existing order, you pay the fee. 
For example, if you are buying at 5000 and nobody is selling at that price (your buy limit order has to be below the mid market price), your order will sit on the book until some "taker" wants to sell for your price. If nobody wants to sell for 5000, then somebody else might buy at 5000.01 (the current price) this will move the price up, and it might keep going up, so your limit order might never be filled.
Basically market orders execute immediately at the current price (they will be matched with any seller or buyer), while limit orders are put on the order book until someone either does a market order, or "gives in" and puts a limit order in for your price. By default you can't put a limit order in as a maker (This is called "post only") anyways though.
So to buy or sell with no fee, the easiest way is to place a limit order for the best bid or ask price. (e.g. if the highest buy price is 5000, put a limit for 5000). Your order might take a minute or so for someone to sell for it (if the price is going down), or the price might move up, in which case you need to cancel your order and retry it (e.g. if the mid market price is 5002.495, try to buy at 5002.49), unless you think that it might come back down. Limit orders can be particularly hard to do when the price is moving quickly. If the price is moving up, by the time you put in an order it may have moved up more, so your buy won't be triggered, the only way to follow the price quickly is with automated trading bots.

The trades do matter. It is a taxable event any time it is sold for USD, whether or not the USD is actually transferred from Coinbase or whatever exchange to a bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:46:06
Ok? Their point still stands, GDAX doesn't have their own fee and they pay the miner fee so withdrawals are free.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:57
Canceled my 13,311 buy order and tried in the 12k range just seconds before it hit 13,300. Whoops.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:21
It does benefit the average Joe. The average Joe doesn't care how Bitcoin works or understand it, but they see that if they invested at any point except the ATH a few days ago, they would have made money. I do hope you 8k prediction happens though :)

Well anybody can use your email (or accidentally type in theirs incorrectly) to sign up for something, but as long as your email is secure (you should use two-factor auth), the HitBTC account can't be activated.
It could also be a phishing email (not from HitBTC, but an impersonator) from someone who hopes you do have an account there, and will try to trick you into inputting your password or something into their fake site.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:07
Wow that sucks, my friend applied for an increase to 50k yesterday and got it approved today so I have no idea how they are prioritizing things. Waiting over two months for a business account though, it’s like they just forget about some applications.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:51:25
Use GDAX and set a limit order, then you can let it hit your target and don't have to look at the price chart all day to try and time it. You may have missed the 13k dip though, it's already gone down 30% or so and might start recovering now. Also realize that crypto is mostly speculation and try not to panic sell :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:12:04
They have a new "instant buy" feature enabled for some accounts, that might be why. I think they enable it once they trust your account enough.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:41
Yes, I meant too few sell orders not buy orders.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:32:19
If that were to happen I don't think there would be a spike in a couple of years, there are enough coins now that a better one will take over 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:54
It hit 19k for a minute or so 
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:29:35
It is as simple as attempting to predict the future, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:28
19k in 4 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:54
People are freaking out over something they don’t understand. GDAX only allowed live trading for like two minutes before they shut it down. There are always high sell orders for every coin, but there were so little sell orders that many uninformed people purchased with market buy orders and got matched with these high prices. I don’t see how this failure is a scheme, the real scam is BCH going up so much hours before Coinbase announced they were adding it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:53:35
Bitcoin is very hard to predict and because of that is is very easy to screw up and lose more than if you just held your coins. Looking at the past charts it might seem easy to predict the drops but in reality how do you know where the bottom or the top is? It is also hard to "day" trade something that trades 24/7.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:39:44
GDAX lets you place actual orders on the market. You can place a limit order and pay no fees (as well as no bank transfer fees)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:31
Exchanges have an order book which has all the open orders (people who want to buy at X price and sell at Y price). When you do a market order to buy, it will match you with someone who wants to sell. If the market is moving quickly and you put in a market order, the price may change as orders in front of yours are matched. So if you wanted to buy and it said it was at 10,000, the price could move down to 9,000 (which happened to the parent comment) before your order is next in line. Limit orders let you specify an exact price to buy or sell at, and the order won't execute unless you match with another order or they match with yours. So in the case of the crash in the past few minutes, many people had limit buys open near 9,000, allowing them to buy only if the price went down that low.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:38:50
GDAX has a 0.25% fee for market orders, 0 fees for limit orders.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:58:17
Look at the charts, it dropped hours ago.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:03:42
It just means hold

GDAX is more of a trading platform, as you can put in orders for specific prices and also see the current volume, order book, etc. The only difference is you have to transfer your USD, and _then_ buy. With Coinbase you buy the Bitcoin and are locked into that price until the transfer is finished, so I would actually consider that a benefit of GDAX, you just need money in your account prior to exchanging it.
Trading fees are 0.25%, unless you are the maker of an order (in which case it is free), so you need to place a limit order (such as one cent above or below market price) to avoid that. It sounds complicated but it really isn't, worth looking into if you are buying a significant amount.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:45:25
If you set it to "Allow Taker" you can put a limit order for any price. Not sure if they have any mechanism to cancel mistakes that are wildly different from the current price though.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:29:39
Not anymore :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:29:17
Nope, coinbase is just sending it regardless of if you are a business or not. wtf am I supposed to do with this? The IRS makes it very clear it is for the total amount of payment card transactions processed by businesses. Why can't coinbase just send the correct form like a brokerage would...

But first they will need a Visual Basic GUI!

You don't really own bitcoin unless you have the private keys. Coinbase could be hacked or shut down so it's recommended to send coins bought on an exchange to your own wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:46:43
You don't really own the bitcoin on exchanges, the exchange does. They can do whatever they want. This includes not giving you your split coins. When you send the coins to a wallet, you have full control over them.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:56:35
Can't believe it took me so long to get verified on GDAX, loving having to pay no fees now instead of a transfer fee plus buying above market price on Coinbase. This is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:05:15
Same feeling here. Saw it at 5100 when I woke up but held off thinking it would go lower. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:14:10
Start learning then: 
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:36:17
If you get verified on GDAX there is like a 25 cent fee for bank transfers and 0 trading fee if you are the taker.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:16:04
You may have to do KYC (Know your customer) verification if you haven't already on Coinbase. This is usually a problem for those under 18 or with no credit history.
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:21:36
No, you can only purchase with funds already in your GDAX account so you need to have money available ahead of time to buy at a certain price, on the up side you can sell it back instantly instead of watching the price go down and not being able to do anything for a few business days.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:10:37
Yes, that is all you need to do. Also, if you link your Coinbase account to GDAX (the exchange which is ran by Coinbase) you can avoid bank transfer fees and trading fees (for limit orders).
