I'm pretty confused at the moment. I'm assuming this means that the value of btc will drop significantly in the near future, right?

I've been reading for an hour on here and and it's confusing as hell. I'm holding in coinbase right now and having a hard time deciding what to do. What advantage does a hardware wallet offer in this situation if coinbase is neutral right now?

Right, so it seems the possibilities are:
Agreement is reached, causing a split where miners/major holders choose UASF and then one of two things happens: 
1. Majority of users move to UASF - price drops incredibly low (at least in the short term)
2. Majority of users reject UASF - price increases and miners/large holders/exchanges are forced to follow
Agreement is NOT reached, causing a split where miners/major holders choose not to follow UASF and then one of two things happens: 
1. Majority of users move to UASF - price drops (less than if an agreement was reached) and miners/large holders/exchanges are forced to follow
2. Majority of users reject UASF - price increases
Is this correct?

That makes sense but UASF means a much greater supply of coins, which means the price of each individual coin should drop, doesn't it?

Thanks for the info. If there are coins that exist in both blockchains, shouldn't the price of each individual coin drop due to a more than doubling of supply? And if we get coins for both blockchains through say, coinbase, what is the benefit of moving to a hardware wallet for the near future?

Aaaand transferred! Thank you

Not at all, I'm just trying to get clarification if I have the right understanding at all.
