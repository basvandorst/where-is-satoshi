I'm not sure what that means. I recouped my initial investment by selling crypto currency for USD. I took some profit by selling cryptocurrency for USD. I still have some cryptocurrency in the market hoping for further gains. Where is the fallacy?

So here's the deal; I became convinced in early November that bitcoin was a good bet: I had some spare cash because I had just sold a house, I invested and basically doubled my money. I'm currently playing with other peoples money, or since this is crypto, manufactured money. Have I behaved responsibly?

I'm not sure where I did anything wrong. I invested, I took a reasonable profit, I took my investment out, I am now speculating using money I did not invest. Where is the fallacy?
