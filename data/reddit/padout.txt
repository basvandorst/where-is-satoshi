You should take a look at BIP 38, from what I can understand it is crazy secure, basically uncrackable with a long enough password.

Can someone tell me if they did it in a way any different from how bitaddress.org does it? I have tried using BIP0038 through bitaddress on my pi but never succeeding, I was under the impression it was too demanding.

It doesn't make much sense to me, and yeah that would be one of the reasons. It makes the ponzi scheme argument seem a little more legit even if it doesn't really.

I'm not sure I understand, who is he obviously?

Yeah, that's what I was thinking, if somehow some software could change the generator in Electrum but I suppose that is a little too paranoid. If you don't mind me asking is everything in your notes necessary? I had the notion all I had to do were type in the three lines they give you at the Electrum website.

I actually have a question about electrum if you don't mind. Will the seed recover coins received in addresses made by electrum after the initial five? If so how?

I see in your notes you have to go online with the Pi, doesn't this make it less secure, and is there away of not having to go online.

I think it's more of a percentage issue..

Encrypt your paper wallet with BIP0038 and ask one or more of your friends to hold the extra wallets for you.

That is a good explanation I'll have to remember when someone asks me about it, it's just the one thing that still bothers me when super skeptics ask about every possible fault in bitcoin. But yeah, it just seems strange that he/she/they remain(s) anonymous, but who knows.

Brain Wallets: I hear they are insecure, as in if it is easy enough to remember it is not good enough of a passphrase. However, I saw a post some time ago on the same topic and was wondering how secure this method would be:
* Use a very easy passphrase like: (firstname)(lastname)
* Take that private key and use it as a passphrase for a new brain wallet 
* Repeat this x amount of times. (lets say &lt;10)
* Use that last one as the real wallet
All you have to do is remember your full name and how many times you hashed it. There are a lot of alternative ways to do this, but I want to know how secure would the method above be in terms of brute force/rainbow tables.
How safe would this be?

Honestly the fact that we still don't know who satoshi is/are really freaks me out.

Does this mean electrum is not secure because it uses a 12 word seed?

Bitcoin mining seems like such a funny thing. Why would I sell a product when I can make more money using it? By selling them to you they are admitting that you cannot profit off them. I guess in some cases they want quick returns? Am I making sense?
