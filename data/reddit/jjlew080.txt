something like [this](
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:00:31
nice thanks. I will google it, but, off hand, who offers laminating services? 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:44:01
total noob here. I bought a bitcoin for my son when he was born, he just turned 2. I'd like to give it to him on his 18th birthday. I know this is sarcastic comment, but I have kept mine on the exchange where I bought it. 
What is the best way to store a coin for the long term? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:04:19
yeah I was thinking that. I forget many passwords over a much, much shorter time period. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:46:56
you mean buy like 0.02 of a coin first? how do the fees work? do I pay fees per transaction? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:28:36
18 years doesn't really seem like getting rich quick. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:56:25
so if I lose that paper wallet, or it gets destroyed, the coin is gone forever? the private key is the proof the coin exists, but can be stolen if someone else gets that number? 
also is $415-ish the market price right now? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:28:12
I told her my idea and her response was, "a what?" 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:07:45
maybe print a photo of the key and throw that in the box? laminating the wallet is a good idea too. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:29:08
maybe he will celebrate that way, 0.003547 BTC per lap dance. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 13:15:30
no and no! 
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:13:01
I just did the same thing, same price. Except I bought mine for my infant son, as an 18th birthday present. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:30:30
this is a good question. As far as I understand the IRS treats bitcoin as property, so does that mean its subject to yearly capital gains taxes? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:22:00
Does coinbase exchange essentially have the same risk as going under as MtGox? I still don't exactly know the details of what happen to MtGox, but specifically how people could lose their actual coins if an exchange goes bankrupt? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:19:43


sorry, how exactly do I do this? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:44:54
The coin I buy could be worth zero in 18 years. He will be pretty pissed when I give him the paper wallet if that happens! Happy birthday son, here's an old piece of paper! I don't expect it to be worth tons of money. The most I honestly expect is a few thousand, that would be a nice cushion for him in college. If its $10K+ it will go towards his college tuition. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:00:38
would you recommend throwing it in a safe deposit box at bank? is that a common way to protect the wallet? 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:28:27
ok got it, so basically treat the wallet (and key) the same way you would paper money. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 17:52:54
Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but the blockchain technology, if adopted, would really have nothing to do with bitcoin, right? They just want the technology, not necessarily bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:55:13
Ok that's fair. The Madoff comparison threw me off. The two frauds would get rich in entirely different ways, but still frauds nonetheless. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:43:17
Can someone try to explain this debacle to me? Specifically how would Wright profit by any of this? (opposed to Madoff who obviously did for years.) 
In other words, who gives a shit if Wright is Satoshi or not, why does it matter? 
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:42:28
The old Nigerian Prince scam?? 
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:12:31


This makes no sense to me. Lets say Craig had those funds, why would he just give them away? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:41:22
down 40% in one day. ouch. The bid/offer spread is 50 ticks wide. I think the author forgot to include "liquidity" (or lack of) for a reason. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:55:55
"the U.S. is applying money-laundering rules to "virtual currencies," amid growing concern that new forms of cash bought on the Internet are being used to fund illicit activities." It's actually the first sentence. 
Make no mistake, just like the ECB did last year, the fed is going to start throwing everything it can to stop alternative currencies from gaining popularity. Money is nothing without faith that it has value to those who exchange it for real assets. They are terrified the pieces of cotton they are printing will be worth nothing someday soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:57:15
here's another reason 
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:23:53
How do you figure? They are applying the same rules so they can treat it the same way. In doing so, they are trying to find a way to crush its popularity and growth. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:31:37
Just wait for "executive order 6102" "forbidding the Hoarding of bitcoins within the continental United States". 
@_date: 2013-08-10 13:50:25
This video illustrates exactly why alternative currencies like bitcoin are gaining traction. The ECB and The Fed are in a very similar boat as Japan. It's essential to understand the state of other currency markets when educating yourself about bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:42:48
Yes that's right, any virtual transaction using virtual currency will now be looked at as money laundering. It's just a way the fed can crack down on its use. The fed knows that once people loose faith in our current currency, the Ponzi scheme will collapse, so they will use any means necessary to stop it. This is just the beginning. No need to argue semantics at this point. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:13:48
Do you guys think I am against bit coins?? No I'm against the government trying to clamp down on a currency that people are starting to realize has more value than the money they are printing to keep the Ponzi scheme going. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 17:57:18
yeah not really a great endorsement from somebody who's net worth went from $100+ million to almost nothing.
