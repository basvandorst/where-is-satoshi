It was a good presentation.  Unfortunately he openly admitted he would not support a short term solution to increase the block-size in order to leverage getting funding for an ultimate fix.  I interpreted that as willingness to spite bitcoin until he got what he wanted with funding and a better solution.

That guy was trying to make a pro regulation argument and said the bitcoin community was "too far to the left" and they need to come to the center.  He's confused.

I think the mining talk is throwing people off track.  I saw this October 14' tweet from Balaji and I think it sums up the core business strategy of 21.  
“A big part of AI is game theory.  A big part of game theory is incentives.  Bitcoin allows algorithms to act on incentives.  Over time, Bitcoin will stimulate a worldwide build-out of mini trading-focused AI’s”. 
21 is proposing to create a platform where AI devices can interact in an environment that has a clear defined incentive structure, satoshis.

1) How does one become anointed as a "bitcoin core developer"?
2) Approximately how many full-time core developers are needed to support Bitcoin? I'm not asking how many there are.
3) Who do the core developers work for?  By this I mean are they making proposed changes to the code that they deem appropriate?  that the community deems appropriate (non-technical members also)? or that the company paying their wages deems appropriate?
4)  Are people concerned that funding of core development being placed on large companies in the space is going to lead to development decisions focused on the priorities of those paying the bill and not necessarily the community as a whole?
5)  What is the decision making process to resolve disagreements between core developers on code changes?
6)  Does a bitcoin core developer have any responsibility to build confidence within the community?  Visa versa is there protocols for handling disagreements on code changes that don't involve public rants on Twitter or Reddit?
