Worldwide adoption in 2/3 years is highly unlikely. I'd say 20 years, if it happens. It needs a similar or even more dramatic change of society than the internet (which is still at ~50% adoption).
A scaling solution for current demand is out there, SegWit. Businesses need to adopt it though.

Exchanges look at your data individually when you open a new account. That's why it takes months for new accounts atm. So adding one manual step more during an account registration won't change much.
But having said that, exchanges have a similar risk with or without LN channels. Users need to be able to withdraw, meaning they need to sign transactions with their private keys today as well. And they probably don't do this manually.

The value lies in the network, not the software itself. Bitcoin is, of all the cryptocurrencies, the most reliable and has proven to be secure over the years. So it has a good chance of becoming the base network for all sorts of applications and businesses. That's my opinion.

In the early stages time locks were set to absolute times. Now they are set relatively so that a channel can be open infinitely. The "time" starts ticking once you broadcast a transaction to go on chain.

Because by putting your paper wallet in a bank vault you have a single point of failure. If politics in your country are stable and the bank can be trusted generally, there is still the possibility that the bank just burns down or the paper is eaten by a book worm or whatever. Also, banks have been robbed in the past. Also, you go to the bank by yourself and pick it up by yourself. Some people have millions of dollars worth in crypto. Running around in the city with a paper wallet with such amounts is just plain stupid.
I'd keep 1of3 at home, 1of3 at the home of someone you trust enough, and 1of3 in a bank vault. All with above mentioned 2of3 method. It's just the only safe method of storage I can think of. If your house burns down, you go to the bank and your friend's house and recover the coins. If the bank gets robbed you have the other two. If your friend disappears -&gt; same

Think of "opening a channel" like getting money out of an ATM (the blockchain being your savings account).
You only need to "close the channel", meaning deposit the money back into your savings account, if you don't plan on spending more money in the channel.
If you spent all the money, you don't need to "close the channel", because you would gain nothing from that (like depositing 0$) and have nothing to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:27:55
Could be infinite, if the channel is used for bidirectional payments. Like, bookkeeping between you and a friend. Most users probably will use it for payments only, so they close the channel when they have no funds left in it

The bitcoin price follows an adoption curve. And adoption is exponential because everyone involved talks to x other people and get them involved.
Of course it doesn't grow infinitely. But I think we're still nowhere in terms of adoption. It's my opinion. That said, I also take that link posted with the moon math with some sarcasm. I don't think there will be a $1M bitcoin, at least not in a decade

amateur, quick and dirty translation of the video interview:


A: It's a meeting of many professionals, there is a lot of exchange of expertise, new ideas are created, it's a gathering of experts with the same common interests. That's promising. And when they not only talk about the opportunities, but also about the risks involved, they are doing a great job.


A: A new industry could be created, which could mean growth and new jobs. That's quite possible. The first iteration is partially successfull, partially less successfull; A lot of learnings are made in the field.


A: Switzerland is critical as well. Switzerland is always critical against new things. But, I'm pleased to have the so called "crypto valley" in Switzerland in the canton of Zug. With the experiences made in Zug it's quite possible that this new industry could become a nationwide opportunity. But like said, we keep also a critical view. But only when you take the risk, you have the opportunity to create something new. With the 4th industrial revolution that is taking place right now we want to enable new opportunities like we did in the previous industrial revolutions.


A: With every big jumps in value there is some uncertainty. But it's something that hasn't been established yet and something that is still seeking balance. That takes time and patience. It takes corrections and learnings. It's an experiment. If it succeeds, that's great. If not, I'm sure new interesting ideas come up.


A: No, I don't have any. I just try to inform myself and listen to those courageous people that have started to move in this new field. Not only when they talk about the good side, but also especially when they talk about the critical parts. I think that's a good base for political decisions

How? I'd argue you can't do that. You'd need to close and reopen.

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:21:50
In my opinion the bitcoin blockchain will act as a secure settlement layer in the future. For payments we will see upper layer solutions. Like LN, but probably with a third layer in between to open, close and refund LN channels instantly.
Then we will have sidechains of very different kinds, chains that are built around the bitcoin ecosystem. They could simply be networks with less decentralisation with the advantage of higher throughput or provide interesting features like turing-complete decentralised smart contracts.
In my view we will have one single main chain/network and everything built on top of that. Not 1000s of altcoins in parallel like today. And I think that bitcoin has a great chance of becoming that main network. Simply because it has proven to be secure, has the biggest adoption and last but not least has a bonus of being first.
But yeah, it's speculation. No one is in a position to be able to predict the future. And I respect other people's opinion saying that bitcoin is the new myspace and will fall on day.

Let's consider a LN channel between Alice and Bob, where Alice initially has 1 BTC and Bob has 0 BTC.
A single LN transaction means that Alice signs and sends a transaction to Bob, and Bob signs and sends a transaction to Alice. Notice that there are actually 2 transactions created for just one change of funds in the channel.
Each of those 2 transactions are multi-sig transactions, requiring a signature from Alice AND Bob to be a valid transaction.
**Transaction 
Let's say Alice wants to send 0.3 BTC to Bob. This should lead to Alice owning 0.7 BTC and Bob owning 0.3 BTC.
Alice therefore creates transaction with 2 outputs:
Output 1 contains 0.3 BTC and can be spent by Bob immediately. Output 2 contains 0.7 BTC and can be spent by Alice after 1000 blocks or by Bob immediately if he gets Alice's private key for that specific transaction.
Alice signs the transaction and sends it to Bob.
Bob creates a slightly different transaction with 2 outputs:
Output 1 contains 0.7 BTC and can be spent by Alice immediately. Output 2 contains 0.3 BTC and can be spent by Bob after 1000 blocks or by Alice immediately if she gets bob's private key for that specific transaction.
Bob signs the transaction and sends it to Alice.
Now let's say this was transaction  and assume Alice makes another transaction where she sends another 0.1 BTC to Bob, the transaction 
**Transaction 
Alice therefore creates transaction with 2 outputs:
Output 1 contains 0.4 BTC and can be spent by Bob immediately. Output 2 contains 0.6 BTC and can be spent by Alice after 1000 blocks or by Bob immediately if he gets Alice's private key for that specific transaction.
Alice signs the transaction and sends it to Bob. PLUS: Alice sends her private key for the transaction  she sent to Bob.
Bob creates a slightly different transaction with 2 outputs:
Output 1 contains 0.6 BTC and can be spent by Alice immediately. Output 2 contains 0.4 BTC and can be spent by Bob after 1000 blocks or by Alice immediately if she gets bob's private key for that specific transaction.
Bob signs the transaction and sends it to Alice. PLUS: Bob sends his private key for the transaction  he sent to Alice.
**Transaction  - infinity**
Alice and Bob can send transactions between each other infinitely. For each transaction, they send the private keys to the last transaction
**Closing of channel**
For a normal channel close, both Alice and Bob would send each other transactions with the final balances. Let's say after 400 transactions Alice has 0.2 BTC and Bob 0.8. So the transaction would just have 2 outputs: Output 1 with 0.2 can be spent by Alice immediately. Output 2 with 0.8 BTC can be spent by Bob immediately. Note that this would be basically a normal multi-sig transaction without the 1000 blocks delay.
Alice or Bob can commit that final transaction to the blockchain by broadcasting it to the bitcoin network. Once included in a block, they both end up with their amounts securely in the blockchain.
**What if Alice disappears**
Let's say after transaction  Alice goes offline, be it malicious or by accident. Bob waits for a while, but when Alice doesn't reappear, he transmits the transaction  to the blockchain. Once included in the block, his 0.4 BTC are frozen for the next 1000 blocks, starting from the moment it is included in the blockchain. Alice can get her funds back immediately.
**Fraud attempt**
Let's say after transaction  Alice tries a fraud. She transmits the old transaction  to the blockchain, which would lead to Alice having not sent that 0.1 BTC in transaction  The transaction  gets included in a block. That transaction states that Bob can get his 0.3 immediately. Alice's 0.7 BTC on the other hand are frozen for the next 1000 blocks, starting from the block the transaction is included. 
These 1000 blocks give Bob enough time to act. Bob sees that an old transaction has been included in a block. Because Alice sent him the private key to transaction  Bob can get out Alice's 0.7 BTC immediately, before Alice can get it after 1000 blocks. That would lead to Bob having 1 BTC and Alice 0 BTC.
So Alice's fraud attempt of 0.1 BTC made her lose all her remaining BTC in the channel.
That's why such attempt is not a good idea on LN.

HW wallets will support LN in the future. So the private keys won't touch your system. A hub node that routes other payments will let the HW wallet sign. To open a new channel the HW wallet might request your attention, meaning you confirming the opening of the channel by pushing a button on the device. But LN payments will then be signed automatically. So a hacker would first need to open a channel with you and then if he can get into your system he could only hack the funds in that channel and nothing else. That would reduce the risk dramatically.

Also, on the other hand, it will be the first time in human history that software gets released way before the date of delivery

This is why investing is broken. Kickstarter has shown that with mass effect, a startup can raise enough money with 1$ investments through the effect of the masses. There lies the future.

No you were not stupid, you just stopped in the paragraph before that at "McAfee's poll"

I agree to 1903. The automobile has failed hard. When every 100th person dies of cars and every 2nd person gets injured, many of them leading to disabilities, it's a major failure and would simply never be admitted today as a product.
I hope this will be fixed soon, but after over a century with fatality numbers rising I'm not so sure

Convert your 0.5 USD into 0.000093 BTC and HODL

This is correct of course. Even mining for brain wallets isn't profitable anymore

Yes. That's why I strongly believe that bitcoin becoming mainstream won't happen tomorrow, next year or anytime soon. I'll give it 10-20 years at least.
It probably happens together with a huge AI/robots boost, basic-income and other things to come.

Bitcoin is all about making borders and nations obsolete. So no, no hardcore bitcoiner will buy into such bullshit

When/if bitcoin goes mainstream, nobody would want to own a car. Owning a car will be a stupid thing in 10 years. Transportation, also by car, will be a service

Could happen one day, but only if the value of the dollar collapses to zero while bitcoin remains. A million $ will then buy you a new phone, nothing more

Could, but don‘t
