But if you want to pay 11.1111111 BTC (or any number that is big enough so that you need to use several of you inputs), you would need to make a transaction with several inputs and this to a more expensive time. For 10 inputs and 2 outputs we would have a transaction size of 1900 bytes. With 5 sat/byte you would 1900*5 = 9500 sat = 0.000095 BTC. So the current consolidation fee would be about 1$. 
Now let's compare that with the situation i talked about: You need several (i use 4 in this example) inputs to pay for something and the fees are up to 500 sat/byte. Your transaction would have a size of ~800 bytes. So you pay: 800 * 500 = 400000 sat = 0.004 BTC so about 40$.
So it can useful useful to consolidate. Especially if you have many smaller inputs (e.g. 20x 0.05btc). Also having you bitcoin in one address for  1$ could be a reasonable price if you just want to improve your overview about your asset.

Is coinbase really a good solution for such small invetments? I use Bitstamp because they allow me to make free deposits (from europe).

Maybe short term, but if scaling can't be solved off chain (for example with the lightning network), then Bitcoin (or copies  like LTC or BCash) simply can't scale. But even short term this is a problematic solution, because rising the blocksize will kill many full nodes and centralize bitcoin. But decentralization is the major selling point against other solutions like Fiat.

Have a look at [btcrecover]( It has also a handful of options for typos.

I also recommend Bitstamp (for smaller volume)! You can deposit money with SEPA for free. Buy coins with a 0.25% fee and then withdraw without a flat fee. Best exchange I have / can  use in Europe till now. To my knowledge they are even using Segwit.

I am currently at work and can't do a full reply like i want to do. So the short form:
A. Have you looked how the blocksize, blocktime, number of transactions of all time etc. compare with the bitcoin technology.
B. I'm not only talking about miners, but all full nodes that main purpose is validating the blockchain.
C. Not only the size of the blockchain that needs to be stored is interesting but also the bandwith it needs.
 
D. I also explicitly said Bitcoin and his copies and not an altcoin.
E. According to [this]( website the current average fee in the eth network is at 0.86$. Bitcoin has a 5 times higher marketcap. 5 x 0.86$ = 4.3$ would be also quite high. And didn't ETH raise the block size a few days ago?

It would maybe interesting to have a lost of companies, and how bad they are clogging the chain (do they use Segwit? do they batch their transactions?). So that we atleast know which exchanges to avoid. This would increase the public pressure.

This sounds like a pyramid scheme.

The Twitter user Kimchi-King replies with "That means that bitcoin fails to scale"
I would argue, that Bitcoin will scale later if needed. Is this argument correct? And is scaling currently necessary? The last time I read about Segwit, it was said that even Segwit wasn't used by most transactions in the network.

Yeah, or he sell at 2900 and get 20% BTC for free extra.
