I don't like living in a world where people don't have an emergency fund. That, however, is a symptom of poverty, not inflation. I think we should combat poverty and help people have a safety net so that unemployment isn't a death sentence.


Investors put their money into lots of types of investments. If their idea is bad, they lose money. If their idea is good, they get money. As a society, we need people to take (calculated) risks, and as a whole investors are a net benefit to society and cause us to move technology and industry forward. That doesn't mean all investors are saints, don't put words into my mouth.

The point of taxes is to force everyone to pay for these public goods. And that's because of the fact that they are market failures! People won't voluntarily pay for them if they can mooch off everyone else, then other people do the same and soon we have shitty public infrastructure. Firefighters couldn't get paid, neither could police. 
Just because you have crypto doesn't mean you don't have to pay taxes. And if you want to see an example of a country that couldn't enforce it's taxes, look to the recent crisis of Greece. But that's not exactly my idea of a utopia.

The thing about markets is that eventually, the price matches the value. If someone, anyone knew that a bubble was a bubble, they would short-sell it, driving the price down. Thus, if anyone knew of a bubble, it would stop being a bubble because the price would go down.

Money is also used as a store of value and a unit by which you can determine value.


For consumers, it might make sense to save up to spend at a future date. However, we want people/business to invest in increasing production. This very directly impacts the economy. In a deflationary economy, investment is less incentivized.


I can't pick this apart, but in no way does simply holding money boost the economy. If you save the money in a bank or loan it, then it *does* boost the economy because other people will in turn spend it in the economy. However, why would you invest your money if you get real returns on a non-investment?


Money has a lot of uses. If you want it to maintain value over a period of time, you are right that inflationary currency would be undesirable. You also mention the printing of money. Yes, the Fed could increase the money supply so high that it would be effectively worthless. However, they don't want to do that because it would be very bad for everyone - including them.

For the crowd funding platform, you don't need an oracle. Because it deals with objective numbers and balances, you just need conditionals built into the system. This could be done before transaction or after transaction, involving a middle account. For example, you could sign a transaction but that signature says "only pay after total transaction reaches $2000" and any other contributors would add to that transaction. Or, you could pay to an account that, after X amount of time, will forward its funds if the balance is over $2000, but refund if it is less than this amount.
I'm sure there are other ways to do this, and I believe any solution including mine would need changes to the bitcoin system, but it can be done without relying on users. As for the other problems, I believe we need more innovative solutions, such as potentially what you proposed.

Is there a 3rd signature? I don't know the company, but for the rest of this comment I will assume the worst. It is possible for their end to sign a transaction without 2fa, though they would also need your signature. So, potentially better than just one address, because now the only people who can steal your coins are higher-ups in that company that also stole your signature. However there is a new potential drawback: they can blackmail you. If you try to spend 10BTC, they could just refuse to sign the transaction, unless you include a 2BTC transaction to an address they specify in some way.

Without miners selectively including transactions in blocks, the effective block reward is determined by the transactions. Assuming miners will only mine to make a profit, higher total fees will result in higher hash power and lower fees will lead to miners shutting off their rigs. So transactions won't just automatically cost a lot.
Because in reality miners can selectively include transactions, there will be a force to increase your transaction fee. It must be "worth it" for a miner to include your transaction.

An interesting consequence of storing such information on a block chain: there is proof that some user "uploaded" the file hash or magnet link. You can use this as proof of existence of a file before a point in time (link) and potentially solve intellectual property disputes. Also, the file is handily linked to an address so donations could be made to the original uploader (and this could incentivize content creators to store hashes of their content on the block chain). Note that this could just be a SHA hash, not necessarily a magnet link.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:40:33
Couldn't you download the block chain and bring it back in time with you? 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:24:46
One thing to consider: put a proof of existence in the block chain. The idea is that you include a hash of your file in some part of a transaction (recommending a use of OP_RETURN to mark the output as undependable). Once included in the block chain, you can prove that your file existed before that point in time and that you had access to it. It would be useful to also prove ownership of a file, but under this method someone else could simply post another transaction and include your hash. If their transaction was included in a block before yours was, they could pretend to be the content creator. It would be beneficial to tie that hash directly to a bitcoin address and have a way to verify it cryptographically.

Normally one public address links to one private key. However it is possible to make an address that uses two private keys, or maybe make an address that can be decompressed into two keys, requiring both signatures.
The most popular method in bitcoin is where the public address is actually a hash of the script used to verify the spending of the coins (p2sh). The multi Sig part comes with listing public keys or addresses (not sure which) and how many out of those must have signed the transaction.

Edit: I worded it incorrectly. Once one chain becomes dominant, it would only make sense for development to continue on that chain.

Oh right, but I'm not sure what you're arguing. I personally don't think it's necessarily bad to hard code a block size. That wasn't what I was arguing.

No, because you have two options:
*Save the money
*Spend the money
If you have $100, and dont spend it, you will have $100 (which is worth more, due to deflation). You have nominal gain, and real gain, by doing nothing.
If you have $100, and spend it in order to earn $90, youll only have $90 (which might be worth more than the original $100, but is still less than the $100 woild be worth *now*) You have real gain, but less so than before, and no nominal gain.
There are investments in this economy that don't beat inflation, but do beat holding cash. Bank savings accounts often offer less than 1% return, while inflation is larger than that. You are losing real value, but gaining nominal value. Bonds can have low return too.

One question I have yet to have answered about Austrian economics is that, during deflation, why would anyone want to invest? Dollars, or whatever currency unit, increases in value over time. You only invest if your return is greater than your cost. The more deflation there is, the less investments make sense, so we have less means of production, right? 
@_date: 2016-06-27 06:39:24
That's still part of the market at large. If there is a price difference, then arbitrage is possible and theoretically will close the price gap. If there isn't a price difference, then their buying OTC and selling on exchanges accomplishes nothing.

You are using ballpark estimates that ignore actual inflation and actual returns on investment. Businesses beat inflation, end of story. You can't pretend that, somehow, people actually buy the $100 machines to make $110. In real life, the numbers make sense.


I have said no such thing.
You haven't answered my question. I'm claiming that under deflation, investment in production will be lower because fewer investments will offer returns that are higher than the real return of simply holding on to money. Investments that don't have a nominal profit don't make sense, ever, because otherwise you can just hold on to cash.

How do you suppose they do it? The fed is a financial institution so it makes sense that it works with other financial institutions.
The effects don't just hit stocks. The interest rate of the entire economy changes because the us treasury bond rate changes. That means *every financial decision* now uses a new base interest rate to compare against. If the rate is higher, more people will buy bonds and fewer people (and businesses) will take on debt. If the interest rate is lower, the cost of borrowing money is cheaper so businesses will take out loans to increase production and consumers will take on debt to buy houses, cars, appliances, etc.
Since this affects everyone's spending,  inflation will be impacted across the board.

It's hard to tell exactly what you're trying to say, but I'll respond to the thing with China.
Firstly, why do we need China to buy our stuff? We buy from China, they buy bonds (which makes loaning cheaper). It's a gain for us.
Second, China is about to become way more economically developed than it used to be. The electronics industry is booming and that's just the tip of the iceberg. China is growing, and we need to accept that.

Hard forks are a way to upgrade bitcoin without making a new coin too, but it requires the majority to choose one side.
Also, soft forks are still forks. With segwit, old nodes still function, but since segwit transactions are anyone-can-spend on the blockchain, nodes with non-segwit software can create a transaction that is valid to them, but not segwit nodes. If a miner were to ever mine a block containing a transaction like that, a fork would occur and you could still end up with two coins.

I don't agree that either of those are arbitrary. There isn't necessarily a right or wrong answer, but that doesn't mean it's arbitrary.
For example, voting for president is a big complicated process where people vote for their perceived self-interest. It's complex and somewhat difficult to predict, but not arbitrary.
As far as the arbitrary value of a dollar and money in general, I think we agree. It's dumb, but it works, and if it works it's not dumb.

It discourages holding on to money, which increases consumption and investment in capital goods.


Increasing real GDP


It isn't that all inflation is good. Some inflation is good, more inflation may be better, but a lot of inflation is bad. There's a happy medium somewhere between zero inflation and Zimbabwe. 




Yes, on its own productivity increase is deflationary. I will grant you that. Also you should consider that business don't often like to lower their prices and prefer instead to collect the money as profit. You could argue that in an economy used to deflation, people will be used to decreases in price, so I will cede this point as I can not defend my position further.

What is fragile and not safe? US treasuries are considered the safest investment by interest rate premium.


For me, bitcoin is an interest. I like the possibilities that come from an instantaneous cash-like system, and for that reason I follow bitcoin. I also agree that bitcoin can be an alternative when governments have poor monetary policy. However, I don't think the US dollar will need to be replaced by bitcoin. I think they have different use cases, though they can overlap.

So far, I've watched 22 minutes of the video you provided. I take issue with some of the implications of what he says, though I think factually most of what he said is right.
First off, he keeps calling currency "just numbers in a computer". But what is currency other than numbers? He also seems to support gold- or silver-backed money, but that has its own problems.
Also, he calls the process of issuing government bonds "institutional theft" because the interest is paid through taxes. However, he isn't accounting for increases in productivity or standard of living that come from government programs. He says people work just to pay back the big banks, but the money was lent in order to originally pay for schools or infrastructure or social programs or whatever, so we're paying in the future for something that we've already been benefiting from.
Fractional reserve lending is made scary by saying banks only have 10% of your money, but this is made safe by the FDIC. If anything happens and the bank can't give you your deposit, the FDIC will give you your balance up to **$250,000.**^per ^bank So, if people stopped taking out or paying back loans, you don't lose your money. Not so scary anymore.
As to his main point saying that the rich bankers benefit while the working class pay taxes, I'm not so sure. Working class people still do benefit from this system, so he's wrong there. The only question (which is more difficult to answer) is do bankers benefit *more* than the working class? I don't know. Maybe they do. I'd like to learn more before I can have a more definite answer. Feel free to point me to some info if you have it.

It's impossible to time lock a loan, since the borrower needs to be able to spend the loaned funds. No merchant will want to accept coins that they'll lose in a year.
Loans will always involve risk, and currently the market deems US treasury bonds and FDIC insured bank accounts the lowest risk.

Incurring debt is a way that allows us to consume or invest (I mean in business) above our means in the short run. Otherwise, only people with money (aka rich people) will feasibly be able to own houses, cars, or start businesses.

You're right, that's why we don't do that. There are plenty of metrics that measure "real" economic growth rather than nominal growth. For example, the [price per lumen-hour decreased a hundredfold between 1800 and 1992.](

Bitcoin also has no value, because it only has value if you are confident someone else will want it.

You can't prove a point just by using buzzwords.
If we didn't have inflation, we'd have deflation. Debts would be harder to pay off, people would buy less (goods will cost less tomorrow), less people will invest because holding money will give you a return (the change in investment depends on the rate of deflation), etc.

Shit, I don't even understand what money is now that we have the Fed! Oh wait.


The value of a currency doesn't matter. What matters is real economic growth. Real economic growth benefits from inflation (the value of a dollar decreasing). Inflation encourages people to spend money, whether on consumption (which circulates money in the economy) or buying capital goods (which increases production of products).

If banks can always pay off debts without issue, then why have banks gone bankrupt?

Feel free to explain, but we can definitely spend the money and benefit more than the interest on government bonds. 


The FDIC was created to prevent bank runs. It guarantees that you will get your money. I don't see how that's more scary than uninsured money? Before the FDIC, banks only had the money they kept on hand. If people simultaneously tried to withdraw money, the bank would go under and people would lose their money. This happened. Now, if the bank runs out of money you're still guaranteed to get paid back.


Yes, I have seen that movie. Bankers can be corrupt, I agree. But that doesn't mean the Fed is corrupt, or that inflation is theft. I think it's a topic worth discussing but it's a separate topic in my mind. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:51:32
Interesting. Your definition of prosperity requires decentralized currency, so it's basically a circular argument. Your other points are interesting topics for discussion, but they are all relative. By that, I mean a very poor economy can be more prosperous than a developed economy. I think your model should also include quality of life in its assessment.

It's not complete. You don't know what was sold, or even if anything was sold. Buying a pizza and moving money between wallets are functionally indistinguishable.
You could try to require that as part of the protocol, but it lessens user privacy and also is difficult to police without having an agency look through records and try to catch liars, and now you're back to some sort of governing body.

I somewhat agree, but also don't agree. They have value because the US government enforces payments of debts in them. If you have a debt, and you need to pay it back, your lender *must* accept the payment in USD. They could also accept bitcoin, or Euros or Yen or heck if you owe debt to a restaurant they could accept dishwashing as payment. But if you offer to pay in USD, they must accept and if they decline, you have the force of the US government behind you agreeing that you no longer have to repay the debt. That is why USD is valuable.

Business is about risk and reward. A strictly logical miner will believe that they can, over the lifetime of their device, make bitcoins at cheaper than market value. This might not be the case for all miners, but it is possible that it is true for at least some.
And, after the sunk cost is made, at that point "profitable" changes to mean anything that covers the cost of operation, without the sunk cost. Electricity, location, management, etc can still operate even if it a net loss. They just would be foolish to buy more mining equipment.
