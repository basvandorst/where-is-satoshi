I've had 99.8% of my assets in Bitcoin since 2013, 0.1% in physical 24-karat gold jewellery and 0.1% in a revolving fiat buffet. I've always been happy with that approach.
The 0.2% in other liquidity types is needed because my rampoff exchange method could come under attack. When localbitcoins.com dropped it's physical cash option, I lost my rampoff backup method. I still need to fix that problem.

Diversification would be a reasonable strategy in absence of any deeper understanding of what you are buying. Otherwise, use your understanding to make a real choice. Still, if you do not understand what you are buying, you'd actually better not buy it at all. In that sense, diversification never makes sense.

"Hardware wallets" are a misnomer. The essence is still a set of software abstractions. These software abstractions are certainly not better than running an electrum wallet on two physical machines, and not even running them on two virtual machines.
As long as people do not realize that "hardware wallets" are still just software, we will keep having this ridiculous discussion.

Hodling is similar to Nassim Taleb's strategy. He says that stock markets are black-swan prone and that the other players substantially underestimate the probability of a black-swan event in which the stock market collapses. He only made money three times, but then spectacularly.
Therefore, hodling is a vote of no confidence against the central bank, because it will some day inevitably pull a "venezuela" on us. 
Furthermore, the only currency that really matters is the USD. If that one goes down, all other ones will too. Hence, hodling expresses distrust against the FED.

The price level in which he trades will be in fiat for the time being. Therefore, switching to displaying prices in bitcoin is not realistic for now. Just settling in bitcoin is more than good enough. Furthermore, if he holds on to bitcoin, while he needs to settle with his own suppliers in fiat, he is running a serious currency exchange risk. Therefore, at this point in the evolution of bitcoin, he will still have to convert a large part of his bitcoin receipts to fiat. He can do that without dragging the fiat bankstering system into the fray by using stablecoins such as USDT, bitUSD, or trueUSD. All of this may improve in the future, but for now, we do not want bitcoin-accepting merchants to go bankrupt or have to charge uncompetitive, high margins, just to cover for the existing mismatch.

Yes, sure. Still, in all practical terms this results in the messaging or exchange of cryptographical documents/records. Your wallet will have to store some kind of data, while the node will also have to do that. It is obviously largely automated, but it still helps to point out the existence of these "receipts".

Yes, but I am very interested in the security of these things. So, I need to know what the system stores, what messages it sends, what messages other people need to receive, and so on. If I want to backup the state of such system, what do I copy and why? What do these files represent? And so on.
This aspect of things cannot merely be declared irrelevant. It really is not.
I need to be able to explain to other people why it is secure to do things in terms of data storage, and what they have to keep an eye on.
But then again, I am waiting for the electrum wallet to finally merge LN support to investigate what documents and messages the electrum wallet is storing, and transmitting, and so on; if only, with a view on backing up/restoring the wallet's state. 
For example, I am not happy with the fact that electrum has classified support for BIP38 to be low priority. In terms of backup/restore procedures, it is high-priority to me, but ok, it is not entirely "critical" either, because I have concocted a (barely satisfactory) workaround for electrum's non-support of BIP38.
You know, what people want to know, is that their hard drive may crash and burn, or that they may lose their phone, but that their money is still safe. This problem is absolutely not imaginary.

Agreed. Still, someone has to run these LN nodes. There is a crowd doing that, and indeed, not necessarily the existing exchanges. This crowd also have to pre-fund the LN contracts of new recipient users.
In fact, I begin to think that the pre-funding problem should simply not be solved.
Imagine that you could fund a new commitment on the blockchain using just a claim document on an existing commitment. It would mean that the same funds committed on chain, are now owned twice (and three times and four times, ad nauseam).
So, if the commitments on the chain are the gold, then the LN claims on them, would become the paper money. Solving the problem, would amount to allowing more paper money to circulate than there is gold backing it up. It would amount to reintroducing the same old problem again.
As a consequence, the LN network is to be capital intensive, i.e. "capitalist". I am just a bit worried what that is going to mean. "Capitalist situations" also have their own innate propensity to degenerate ...
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:51:56
Yes, I will look into the nitty-gritty details when electrum has finally merged support for it. At this point, I am not yet interested in parsing LN contracts in detail under the microscope. I am currently mostly interested in how to safely use it, what each file contains, and that kind of things. It is the same idea as that you don't necessarily need to read the application's source code in order to do its system administration. I will start with sysadmin of the wallet files, because that is what I will initially need the most. Furthermore, at this point, I am not going to run a node. I am just going to use the LN support in electrum. But I agree that there is much more to learn later on.
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:26:10
Yes, agreed. LN coins are more useful (faster to receive/pay out) than On-chain coins.
The one problem I detected, however, is that the LN nodes will have to capitalize up on fresh coins to fund contracts with recipient users. I wonder how that is going to pan out?
You cannot fund an LN contract with just a receipt on another LN contract. I think that this will turn out to be the real problem in the LN network. The nodes may need to be more wealthy than they are now, in order to operate and grow.
So, has anybody managed to figure out how to fund a new LN contract with just a receipt on an existing LN contract?
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:30:16
Agreed. If speed is paramount, however, then the user could consider paying through the lightning network, which is obviously the canonical solution for instantaneous payments. On-the-blockchain payments will always be much slower than lightning. We can never fix that.
Furthermore, even though the delay does indeed potentially double after sharding one byte (256 sub-networks), the delay does not further increase when sharding two bytes (256x256=65536 sub-networks). Further growth in capacity does not mean that payments will become slower again.
By the way, currently, when the current block is already full, the user will have to wait for the next block for his transaction (or increase the fee he pays). In that sense, not sharding at all (or not using any method to increase capacity) and just letting the blocks run full, could also lead to unpredictable delays.

My problem is not that I would need to know how hardware wallets deal with USB communication. My problem is that I want lots of security researchers to work on that problem. My job is not to write security advisories, but I certainly read them.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:12:23
Assuming that their method works, we still have the following issue. If there is no way to update the firmware, and it happens to contain a vulnerability, you can throw away the hardware wallet.
If it allows updating the firmware, this will necessarily done over the same channel as the transaction signing, i.e. the USB port. In that case, the very fact that the internet-connected laptop is capable of updating this firmware, becomes an entire security minefield.
I am ok with the idea of updating the firmware, but it must not be possible over the USB port.
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:00:05
For various reasons, the possibility to escape from a virtual machine is considered an enormous black swan. The number of security researchers investigating exactly that issue, is [really large](
So, I prefer to sit on an alleged impossibility that is [very closely monitored]( by a large number of security researchers, than on an impossibility for which I do not even know how many are looking into it. It is not just the USB stack. It is the entire intercommunication between laptop and this hardware wallet device that is at stake. If the laptop can emit instructions to upgrade the firmware of the wallet device, there is an additional minefield to verify.
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:17:58
I am not advocating the use of a "paper wallet". I proposed two alternatives instead: 
1. The use of two virtual machines of which one is disconnected from the network, on a hypervisor that does not run anything else than virtual machines. Security principle: the impossibility to escape from a virtual macine.
2. The use of a laptop or phone and a disconnected signer phone, which communicate signed/unsigned transactions with each other using QR codes. The electrum wallet can do that. Security principle: the impossibility to communicate the seed as a QR code.
These alternatives are, in my opinion, safer than hardware wallets, which in my impression lack a solid and verifiable security principle.
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:01:20
I personally use two virtual machines (virtualbox), with the signer disconnected from the network, and generally no programs running on the host, except for virtual machines. The security of that setup rests on the (practical) impossibility to escape from a virtual machine to the host.
An alternative method would be to use two phones, with one signer phone disconnected from the network, and both phones communicating unsigned/signed transactions over QRCodes. In principle, the electrum wallet supports that procedure.
Security means that there is something impossible to do, and that the entire design respects that impossibility.
For example, it is intractable to reverse an elliptic curve multiplication: P = k x G with k the private key and P the public key. The entire hardware/software/math design in bitcoin seeks to respect this intractability. That is the foundation of its security.
What exactly would be the foundation of the security of existing hardware wallets?
I do not see how they prevent copying the secrets to the internet, besides some really flimsy software abstractions. I can talk to the hardware wallet from the laptop and even update the firmware. Who says that the attacker who controls the laptop will not be able to do that too? On grounds of what principle would that be impossible?
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:38:26
You can't. There is no such assurance. Furthermore, there are certainly adversaries who would love to attack these devices at the centralized factory level.
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:17:35
Ledger could, for example, use QRCodes to exchange unsigned/signed transactions with a laptop or a phone. In that case, it would be impossible to attack the signer device, because it physically only accepts QRCode inputs and nothing else.
Of course, you would also need to make it provable (by open-sourcing the software) that it does not accept any kind of general instructions over a QRCode.
But then again, if the QRCode software can be verified, then the entire device's security would be verified too.

Well, that is the entire debate concerning /dev/random and /dev/urandom. Yes, it may indeed be better to keep waiting for /dev/random. Still, the entire debate about this, is ... [lengthy](
Concerning the entropy of the user-supplied file, it could be good or bad, depending on what the user chooses. I somehow suspect that somewhat the first half of the bible translation into swahili, or into even a more obscure language, should be ok.
You can actually verify the entropy of the input file and its hash.
Furthermore, the entropy of the XOR of two nonces n1,n2 is the maximum of both:
entropy(xor(n1,n2)) = max(entropy(n1),entropy(n2))
Well, that is the idea behind a one time pad (OTP). Otherwise, an OTP would not even work ...
Therefore, a bad seed means that both sources are bad. If just one source is good, then the seed should be good.

The entire space of text is countable infinite. The number of texts published is smaller than that, but also very large. The cardinality of their hashes is undoubtedly smaller than 2²⁵⁶, but I assume that it is still large enough in this context.
If not, can you show me an enumeration of these hashes, or even reasonably construct the set of all SHA256 hashes of all published texts in all languages? You would need it for any serious attack ...
Furthermore, this issue only kicks in when the system supplied entropy happens to be bad. 
The second part was about the fact that, if number r1 is random and number r2 is not, then the result of (r1 XOR r2) is random again. That is what Shannon proved about the security of a [one-time pad](
Concerning leaking the seed by [specially-crafted signatures]( you are certainly right. The signature algorithm requires a securely random nonce k, which should never be used twice. If the hardware wallet uses predictable nonces -- using some kind of PRNG such as BIP32 -- then it leaks the private key.
Still, this problem can be entirely avoided, because according to the [Fiat-Shamir heuristic]( we can use the hash of the transaction message as a deterministic nonce. That is exactly what [RFC6979]( mandates in section 3.2.
Therefore, this particular problem can be solved pretty much entirely, by verifying the source code and ascertaining that the signature nonce k = SHA256(transaction) (or similar). Note that the RFC also allows particular carefully-constructed HMAC variants. They are assumed to be equally secure to just using the SHA256 hash of the tx.

Concerning "stay out of the financial markets or buy tail-risk protection", Nassim Taleb no longer seems to use his famous strategy of buying treasury bonds along with put options in a seemingly improbable range which are seriously underpriced.
Using that strategy, Nassim Taleb made millions of dollars each time the market collapsed (1987, 2001, 2007), but not one dollar in between. He simply exploited the fact that put-option counterparties mistakenly counted on market returns to be distributed normally:
*Traditional portfolio strategies typically follow the idea that market returns follow a normal distribution. However,*[*the concept of tail risk*]( *suggests that the distribution of returns is not normal, but skewed, and has fatter tails.*
It is a brilliant strategy, but there is one big problem with it. The put option payouts are priced in dollars. The FED prevents the next financial crisis from breaking loose by printing dollars, as many as needed. Therefore, if a next financial crisis breaks loose, it will be the dollar itself that will have collapsed, making any put-option payouts in dollars worthless.
That is undoubtedly the reason why Nassim Taleb is no longer interested in mere *tail-risk protection*. In 14:38 he discloses his current strategy: "I own gold". That simply means that he does not trust the dollar, nor any put-option payouts to be paid in dollars. Still, if he owns custodian-held gold, he does not really own gold, because any collapsing financial custodian will also bail in his gold. Therefore, custodian-held gold is not a legitimate hedge either.
Therefore, in my opinion, his fix of a fix still doesn't work.

Well, some BTC holders may want to use this wallet to cash out their bitcoin gold airdrop and in the process of doing so, forget to move their BTC to another wallet first. This is obviously, what the thief hopes, will happen. The targeted victims are therefore BTC owners.

Yes, I have indeed used the fork claimer for airdrops, in cases where there was no electrum fork available. You need to create one CLI instruction per transaction in the wallet that contained unspent output, though. So, you may easily end up with dozens of invocations of the tool (in my case 56 rather dusty tx). I did a script for that, but even then, it still takes a surprising amount of time to prepare things for each airdrop.  An electrum fork is way more convenient. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:32:13
Yes, this is indeed already safer because coinb.in is obviously another party than the wallet that generated the unsigned tx in the first place. So, they cannot easily collude to leak secret bits.
So, it protects from leaking secret bits by the broadcaster, but it does not protect from corruption by the viewer or signer.
This procedure does not verify that there is only one external destination address 
in the unsigned tx and that all other addresses, especially change addresses, belong to the same master public key.
Furthermore, it also does not formally test that the unsigned tx and the signed tx are identical (except for adding the signature).
By the way, it does not need to be a "hardware wallet". Any signer device that is disconnected from the network is equally safe, in a sense that it is prevented from leaking the secrets over the network. So, "hardware" should be understood as "network-disconnected". in that sense, a hardware wallet is not safer than a network-disconnected laptop or phone.
In fact, a hardware wallet is probably less safe, because it tends to get connected to your laptop which is in turn connected to the network.

Concerning the RNG, I try to address the issue by generating the raw entropy manually as an XOR between 32 bytes en provenance from /dev/urandom and 32 bytes resulting from the SHA256 hash of a user-supplied file.

Well, yes, the coins are there, but Remitano does not credit my account ...

True. It could still steal your keys. Therefore, the next level of security is to use two wallets from different vendors for the network-connected viewer and the disconnected signer.
Indeed, it could still leak your keys, but then both viewer and signer need to agree on how to extract the stolen bits out of the signed transaction. This would be hard to do between wallets from different vendors.
Of course, the signer wallet could also surreptitiously substitute the destination address or one of your change addresses with an address of its own.
Still, I have not seen that level of sophistication yet in thefting attempts.
Hence, there is a need to thoroughly verify what exactly you are submitting for signature and what exactly you have signed and submitting for broadcasting.
So, the problem could be addressed with an independent verification program that checks signed and unsigned transactions for what exactly they are doing.
