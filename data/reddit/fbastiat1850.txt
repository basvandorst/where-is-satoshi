hmm...that sounds a lot like a free market...voting with your money...the ability to withdraw consent.  


Again...sounds a lot like a simple free society where markets make that determination, peacefully, voluntarily, and with the necessity for ongoing consent of the individual.  
Why the need to collect money/taxes at all?  Why not just let the invisible hand of free markets coordinate society for us?

You seem to think that only governments can build roads, schools and hospitals.  Governments are only people.
I know people can...but I simply prefer the market eliminate the least efficient of them.  
It seems you prefer to keep the least efficient of them around, give them monopoly authority, and call them your government.
