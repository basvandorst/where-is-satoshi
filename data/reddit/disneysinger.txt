As one of the leaders in the industry they set a lot better example than Mt. Gox did. I have no problem with them abiding by rules and regulations and covering their own behind. Bitcoin is a risky business to be in.

Good point!

I stupidly bought a contract from Genesis mining a few months ago, it says my total hash rate is 2.3 MH/s and my daily payout lately is always around 0.00090100. Do you guys think I am getting ripped off? It is weird to me cause it seems like a ponzi, its always just about 50 cents they're giving me. In the beginning it was much different.

They should have tested a btc micropayment paywall for this, would have been very gentleman

Anyone had any success doing this? I could use the $20 but don't want to get screwed

Moneypot is a gambling site but they give you two free bits every hour to play with, so if you never depoist any btc it is essentially a no risk way to get some. Albeit a very small amount. I think the minimum withdrawal is 200 so you'd either have to play up to that or claim the two bits for 100 different hours

BitDollar would be a much better name than BitUSD.

No car but I'd like to pitch in, could we get an address you can recieve btc at? Thanks for doing this, awesome idea!

And yes I should have said this long ago, but every other week I just thought wow there's no way this isn't annoying someone who works there I'm sure it'll be fixed soon

Since the only two comments so far are quite troll worthy, I'd just like to say yes that was an excellent and interesting speech. Worth a watch.

Thanks for the tip! Cheers!

Would love to help cover some of the international people who request

Yes, what is it?
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:13:25
Yeah I guess Safari is your problem

I just went over to and it looked like a fucking mess. Please stop telling new people to go there. It's a ghost town full of mostly trolls. 
Most Reddit users are smart enough to navigate r/bitcoin and learn on their own. I wouldn't expect to go to r/xboxone and for it be targeted at someone who has never played xbox. I would observe and learn, people will do the same here.

This is a great idea and I will def be using it. Also would love some gold if you're still giving away!
@_date: 2015-03-15 08:29:39
Your balance should now be over $5, cheers!

You expect people to pay you $10 for design feedback when you have this eyesore on your own site...

There is already a Bitcoin company named HoneyBadgr (idk why they spell it like that)
