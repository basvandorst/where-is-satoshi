Ah okay thank you for the clarification on the pi! 
What is the benefit of people running individual nodes then. I can understand its good for the system as a whole, but what is the incentive to the individual?
Sounds like mining is out of the question then.

This is why I'm so stuck on hardware vs paper.

I have heard leaving BTC on an exchange can have some risks, any reason you think this is safe enough?
I am only buying and hodling, not using anything for purchases, just interested in buying a little at a time and keeping it safe.

Anybody with a good explanation on the best cold/hard wallet to set up and instructions on how to do so?
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:55:29
Definitely sound advice, thinking about bi-monthly purchases now instead. Still need advice on setting up a wallet have no idea where to start.

From everything I've read I'm thinking a paper wallet is the smartest move considering I'm in this for the long haul.
Only hodling because I really believe in the technology and don't see this as a fad or just a quick way to make money. (I've had a weird dislike of banks since I was a child and BTC makes me feel more in control of my finance)

Great advice, I could just make one monthly or bi-monthly purchases instead of weekly. I still have no idea how to go about setting up a safe storage option outside of Coinbase, and their app doesn't seem to have any info on autobuys or setting up a wallet.

Any advice on how to set up a paper wallet?

This is exactly what I've read on this sub. What is MtGox?

Great explanation, bitcoin is best explained like you're talking to a five year old. /ELI5
