Like I said, you don't understand crypto. 
This is a new paradigm, and old systems simply cannot exist within it. 
Evolution destroys, as much as it creates. 
Buckle up, we're in for some chops :)

Word. As a seed node, I could see it being more applicable, as long as you monitor logs.

That's not stealing a private key, that's social engineering. 
You can't physically take someones private key, from their mind.
I must reiterate:
I was unaware that brains could be scanned to extract the contents.
Care to share your findings?

I you believe in taxes, you don't understand crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:50:57
Not in a traditional sense of being extorted, but rather having representation in what you interact with ;)
Enjoying the video you shared. 
Have you heard of [The Strain]( Reminded me of the power of rulers, or a "head master."

What's beautiful about crypto, is it allows a peaceful transference of power by rerouting currency peer to peer :)

A tithe is voluntary. You would be tithing.

There is no perfect system, merely an evolution of interactions and how we choose to live.

Taxation is theft, or more precisely: extortion.

I get banned on Twitter on multiple accounts (legitimate posting) yet spam runs rampant.
I get banned on Facebook (apparently I hurt peoples feels with bad wrong think) yet bots and other shit get a pass.
These sites are killing themselves. 
Are there ANY socially interactive platforms that don't censor? Anything Decentralized? Anything in the works?
 Also, props on the 0.16.0 release. Compiling ��

As always, be sure to back up before upgrading anything :)

A truthful angle. 
Distributed networks reroute central collection and distribution and increase efficiency of individual nodes by rewarding mutual exchange.

I'm right there with you. I'm developing tutorials on Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi installations. 
When this PPA is updated, it'll be as easy as this to install a binary:
Bitcoin PPA location : 
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
I still recommend compiling Bitcoin yourself though. If you're going to take responsibility to be your own bank, you should take the responsibility to compile your code, ensuring that your keys won't get stolen by code you can't inspect.
