Threshold signatures allow for the following new concepts:
* secure offchain multisignatures with unlimited participants
* secure shared hierarchical deterministic wallets
* secure bookkeeping
* secure transaction signing delegation and revocation
* inherent private key two-factor security - private key is never reconstructed during the signing process!!! *"A Bitcoin wallet with two-factor security is arguably more
secure than cash, especially with appropriate backup and
recovery options."*
* arbitrary complex combinations of above features

Well, this is only logical conclusion of his previous reasoning ("shops don't accept bitcoin to hold it, they sell it for dollar, so bitcoin as long term currency won't probably work"): He accepts bitcoin via BitPay converting it probably immediately to 100% dollars. So he is not endorsing the bitcoin, he is only using it as actual selling channel. If this channel go away, if bitcoin colapses, he can thus say that he expected it without exposing himself to contradiction.

Convenience in this case means the true security. BECAUSE when security is not convenient but hard or tedious, most people will get tired and they will eventually skip the important security practices.

I have been listening to Peter Schiff since 2010 few months before I found about bitcoin. He is great guy to teach you a lot of basics about Austrian Economy. He just doesn't get that bitcoin is ingenious technology in wild evolution, no matter whether the actual Bitcoin survives or not. He is just stuck with an idea that any currency must be backed by gold to work, while history proves that any backing lasts only to the point it cant be honored.

I expected space for the price going down to enlarge because of these events: 
* price of hardware going down

... don't forget that real security will come with TREZOR's support of multisig and wallets and other backup services that will support it. The real security will be that you won't have to trust TREZOR as 100% hacker-proof device. The fact that TREZOR is 99.9999% hacker-proof is good enough to be used as one basis of the 3-2 multisig like with Greenaddress.it or other similar solutions. Of course that you will only use this for substantial amounts like saving accounts etc.

The concept of threshold signatures is something like doing multisignature transactions off-chain through simple signature transaction on-chain. It differs from standard multisignature transactions in several features (see other comments).
As with stealth address this innovation enlarges the set of strong tools in the ecosystems of cryptocurrencies, thus giving us more freedom to employ the core technology in effective and surprising ways.

Mining is a race of arms. I guess only 5-10% miners is better off buying mining hardware than buying bitcoins directly (this is independent of price evolution). Most money is made by mining hardware and mining contract sellers.
People don't often regognize that when they buy hardware or contract for actual equivalent of 100 BTC and then they mine  50 BTC in total and sell them when price go up 4x, they are 50 BTC worse off, i.e. they lost 50% of potential gain which went to hardware compaines...

@_date: 2014-03-09 20:37:02
You find your probable user ID based on balance. Mostly this balance is unique. If you have several currency accounts, you can then filter this ID and check that the other balancies match too. If you dont know the balance exactly, you can filter probable range and use other hints like withdrawal limits to find your ID. Another way is to filter base on known date-time of last change (trade, withdrawal,...) of any of your accounts.

Yes, bitcoin ATM fees are high. I won't buy/sell bitcoin at ATM. But bitcoin ATM aren't probably for me. Anyway, I expect the fees to go down with the price of machine hardware and competition. This is really big market, so if regulation won't get in way substaintialy, this won't be a problem.
Other thing is that only half of the remittance transaction must use the ATM - typically at the recievers side. The other one can use cheaper channel or start as bitcoin directly.
The unique features of cash to cash remittance via ATMs is speed, which might in some cases justify even higher fees.

Probably bad precendent, neverthless 100% users will never agree to this, since it is not aligned with core principles. If 100% stakeholder agree to this, this is equivalent of everybody giving proportional percentage of bitcoin donnations to Gox for redistributing the coins to their depositors. If 100% users could came to agreement the donnation method is better, because it is doesnt violate core principles and it is voluntary explicitely.

This is absolutely true, they make exactly the same economical sense as if the baker factory would sell baking contracts. The only time you would sell these contracts is when you can make more money by doing this then by selling the real product. This means that the buyer of contract must be eventually loosing money. The only way how this can be hidden away from the contract buyer is when the product appreciate in price during the contract execution. This is what is true most time with bitcoin. Neverthless, the buyer would be alwayes better off buying the product directly instead of going through the contract.

There is one particular aspect that I don't like about the blockchain.info wallet (apart from its complexity): 
Every time user makes any change in the wallet it will send an encrypted backup of wallet to his email. This behavior is set by default. Thus removing all 2FA security in case his computer is somehow compromised.
The feature can be turned off, but most users don't understand this security issue well enough and they expose themselves to great risk in longterm.

If I get Torcoin right, it is not meant to be closed incentivization appcoin as in Safecoin in MaidSafe project (you need Safecoin to use MaidSafe network). The use of Torcoin is not related to the use of Tor network. Serving as a node on Tor network is just a way how to accomplish different kind of Proof of Work. Instead of hashing work tor miner provides network-service work.
Possitive thing about this is that access to Tor network will not be restricted as it is now. Negative thing is that there is no apriori need for torcoin (same as bitcoin) so the initial demand for torcoin will be low. With low price comes weak incentive for tor miner to mine. Unless the price of torcoin will rice with Tor specific speculation or there will be an unique use for it, torcoin will have to fight on the same level as other altcoins with no appriori use-case.
It is worth to think about hybrid approach: 
1) free access to Tor network with limited bandwith
2) paid access to Tor network with reserved bandwith
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:49:48
Not really, there is however an option to use passphrase which behaves like an arbitrary 25th word of the seed. This however has to entered every time you want to send transaction. Nevertheless without passphrase the seed is effectively encrypted.

With bitcoin it is easy to prove that certain ammount of money moved away from your addresses, you just publish the list of address and signed with all the private keys belonging to those addresses, unless you claim that hackers deleted all your private keys and all backups the same time.

It looks like these BadUSBs have supranatural powers and 10 senses. But no, they are just programs, Trezor is built in a way that it is programatically imposible to invoke flashing mode. Then it is absolutely impossible to change the bootloader which checks the firmware storage for signed data (official firmware). I haven't seen any iPhone, printing "You are about to run unofficial firmware, do you want to continue?"
Anyway, it might be very interesting if somebody comes up with a trick how to hack such a dumb device: physically or in software. There are very, very few attack vectors and those can be close in next iteration of software, firmware or hardware.

Actually Ledger's "security" is based on closed sources. TREZOR is open-source, has support of 3rd-party client software, so you don't have to use original client (mytrezor.com) and trust SatoshiLabs if you don't want to.
Moreover, TREZOR has DISPLAY and BUTTONS so:
* you always know what you are signing and you don't have to trust software in your computer
* you always have to confirm any action with physical push of a button, there is no way any software can spend any coin from your wallet by itself
This is not possible with Ledger, so sorry, this "significant more security" claim does not fly.

@_date: 2015-01-01 18:14:25
Please don't call it password, it is misleading.
* **PASSPHRASE is an integral part of a particular wallet** = you can't change the passphrase and keep the same wallet (accounts with the particular addresses).
Even if mytrezor enables you "to turn on" the passphrase, you will get different wallet with each passphrase. Thus if you want your bitcoins to be passphrase protected, you have to move bitcoins from the wallet without passphrase to the wallet with the passphrase.
It will be great however if there is the option to "to turn on" passphrase because then you can move your bitcoins to the protected wallet without wiping your TREZOR and recovering the seed again.

Problem is with selling 200,000 BTC. If they announce it, the message will crush the price and everybody is going to get much less. I heard about that they are considering direct bitcoin payout. I think this is the only real option - I guess, that most creditors want to hold on their bitcoins anyway.

Don't forget to play around and experiment a little bit with your TREZOR and ask SatoshiLabs for TEST coins to have some bullets for that.
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:02:07
One important question. Is there any believable proof that mtgox ever had 850,000 BTC together?
If I were Karpeles and had 200,000 BTC of clients bitcoins, I would could the books so it appeared that there is 850,000 BTC of them and them claimed that 650,000 is missing. Thus his sockpuppet accounts could receive some free bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:06:09
I agree, please use strictly the term passphrase. 
Password can be reseted if forgotten. In this sense the *PIN* is the actual *password*. TREZOR's **passphrase** can't be reseted if forgotten because it is actually **essential part of the seed** which in turn is used when PIN is forgotten or TREZOR lost / stolen and user needs to do his wallet recovery.
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:15:37
Yeah, the brainwallet's passphrase is only "password". Human generated passwords are usually weak. But if you use good password generator passwords are safe enough.
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:54:05
In more detail:
* 1) you buy new TREZOR device uninitialized
* 2) first step is to generate a new seed on the device and create paper backup. This can be done using any software which supports this. Mytrezor.com is the the most advanced tool for doing so, but you can use other  available 3rd party tools as they become (see the link above)
* 3) after that you can use TREZOR with any wallet or service you need to.
You buy TREZOR, download Electrum, setup the device and your are ready to go. You can access your funds using Electrum, Mycelium Android, myTREZOR, etc. and login on any site with TREZOR Connect support.

You don't need any additional master password, the backup seed doesn't count since, you don't have to remember it and you don't have to use it each time. As for the PIN, it is relatively short and can not be keylogged. So you can argue that by this most of disadvantages of master password is removed.

MyTrezor, Electrum, Mycelium, Copay are only Trezor client wallet. They don't hold any bitcoins nor private keys. It is the Trezor device, which holds all the private keya (more exactly it derives them from your seed - 24 words). So each time you connect Trezor with a particular client wallet, it receives from Trezor account public keys, derives account addresses from them and looks up the transactions on blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:08:10
"Our password manager has one advantage that no other similar product has: each password is encrypted in it individually. And unlike other password managers users do not need to know any master password," describes the forthcoming application Marek Palatinus from SatoshiLabs.

I think that account discovery is not possible for multisig at all. Receiving addresses depend on xpubs of other co-signers seeds. In general, for every multisig account you have different co-signers and you have to store their xpubs in the wallet to be able to do tx discovery for particular account.
This is why Copay in higher version didn't follow BIP45 with cosigners indexes. Instead they used m/48' (although no official BIP48 was written for this) with the same substructure as in BIP44. Collected xpubs where used to create unique P2SH account (without cosiginer index level). 
see 
see 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:36:32
As for cosigner index. The problem is that account discovery grows as n^2 with number of cosigners. For 2, there is 4 BIP32 subaccounts to discover for two cosigners, 9 for three cosigners etc. This is why event Copay in higher versions abandoned this for single BIP44-like account structure. The new m/purpose'=48' was introduced to indicate that account discovery cannot be done without external information for each multisig account.

I reference to implementation of multisig in Copay (  
1) Copay doesn't use account discovery because it is impossible in multisig case (if each account should have different co-signers), thus it support only sigle account multisig that must be setup individually in each case.
2) Copay got rid of co-signer index and uses wallet server for coordination of new receiving addresses in signle multisig account that is share among co-signers
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:22:19
This is problem. m/48' wasn't intended for hardware wallets, but to separate account where the discovery is possible (P2PHK accounts &gt; m/44') and where it is not possible (multisig P2SH &gt; m/48') so that there is no accidental overlap.

Remember, TREZOR does not rely on MyTrezor, you can use other wallet as your default wallet or in emergency as a quickfix.
The following wallets are capable of working with bitcoins from MyTrezor accounts (without giving them your recovery seed).
* To watch for new transaction and total balance, Sentinel, Mycelium or Electrum can be used as watch-only wallet. 
* To send transaction, you can use Electrum, Mycelium (OTG cable needed) or MultibitHD (can access only 1st account without passphrase).

There is no trust point here. User clicks on Pay with Trezor and checks the address and amount on Trezor's display against what is displayed on the Bitwala page. Integration of this feature just make everything much more smooth and convenient for a Trezor user.

Did you test a different USB cable?

Trezor is base on STM32F205RE, see 
You need to go to the flash programming manual here  and search for "RDP" (read protection) and "WRP" (write protection). At page 16-17/29, you find the following:
"Memory read protection Level 2 is an irreversible operation. When Level 2 is activated, the level of protection cannot be decreased to Level 0 or Level 1. The JTAG port is permanently disabled when Level 2 is active (acting as a JTAG **fuse**). As a consequence, boundary scan cannot be performed. STMicroelectronics is not able to perform analysis on defective parts on which the Level 2 protection has been set."
Here is the function which locks the bootloader 
WRP for sectors 0 and 1 where bootloader is located means that these sectors can't be overwritten 
RDP level 2 means that no sector is readable through JTAG (external connector used for flashing)
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:18:14
This is valid point. But then MyTrezor is not for you from its start. It has always communicated with SatoshiLabs backend server which is providing connection to bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:29:41
Actually Copay, is the first fully working general multisig wallet supporting TREZOR. Electrum is said to work with Trezor, but I was never able to get it working. 
For building custom wallet you may find interesting that guys from Bitex.la have just integrated Trezor into their Pochette
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:05:15
If you use VPN or other speacial network setup, try going through Chrome + Trezor Extension 
If not, try it anyway... of course, after you try using different usb cable.
@_date: 2015-11-02 00:16:09
Yes, although the important part is the Trezor device only. As for the security of your bitcoins the exact type of client wallet used is quite irrelevant. You can use mytrezor.com, Electrum, MultibitHD, Mycelium and others, see the list here 
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:54:23
Currently, once TREZOR is unlocked during login, it stays unlocked for the connect session (until it is disconnected again). The same behaviour applies to MyTrezor and other wallet working with TREZOR.

You can verify that bootloader source builds to a binary with a particular hash, but I don't think you can verify that Trezor of KeepKey is really running that binary. Or can you?
I think you always have to trust the hardware manufacturer.
@_date: 2015-10-06 14:57:11
TREZOR is not touch by maleability, it depends on the client wallet if it handles the maleability to limit the maleability atack harm. The only true solution to maleability is not to spend unconfirmed transaction or to accept them as valid.

This is misleading, it is not about Trezor firmware upgrade. All it is upgraded is MyTrezor client wallet. a) nobody has to use MyTrezor with Trezor, use Electrum, b) don't turn on labeling while using MyTrezor, if you don't like it.
