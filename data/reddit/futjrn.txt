Money Laundering Laws 
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:36:20
My partners and I are looking to invest in a few of these. Are there any special regulations we should know of? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:41:48
These are obviously my opinions and how I feel on the subject having been in the game and riding the graph waves for almost a year and a half now. 
Feel free to comment or correct if I've represented something wrongly. 
 
All the best,

is this license any different than a regular ATM business license? my attorney is at a loss and is reviewing the laws, but its a little quicker to go the route of reddit expertise.

explain to me like im 5 what Neo &amp; Bee does (as an insider) and I'll consider it after my own research :)

I bought in a 13$ I've never worried

Personally when researching which machine to go with I looked at he lamasu as a flight risk in that they would be easy for theft. 
My partner who visited an ATM industry conference which had the lamasu, genesis1, and robocoin machines on display felt more confident in the people at genesis1; as well as, how well put together the machines wee. 
The add on benefits for he genesis1s are even more astounding for a given cost. 
Resolution: the genesis1 machines are the overall best on the market due to both hardware and software capabilities.

Personally from my research, the lamasu machines are just not quality.
My partners are I are going to be putting Genesis1 in the wild within a matter of months...

I went through a pretty extensive process to get approved. 
after being approved I brought in the routing  decided what % of my paycheck I wanted to go through bitwage, and when I got paid the next week they put the equivalent amount of bitcoin in my wallet of choice.
Paolo, my support gent, is awesome and very helpful gets back to me same day on questions / concerns

Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark!

Those feels 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:04:07
(Anti feelings rules aside...) I do feel bad for the "to the moon" buyers that got in after China's involvement/ shenanigans, but as an early adopter (which really if you paid under $100 for a bitcoin then I'd consider you one too) I'm sitting pretty.
But for all those that wanted to get into the game and couldn't, nows your chance! Buying bitcoin now and pumping money into the market will (almost immediately) drive the price back up. 
I have a feeling that come tax refund or even earlier than that in 2014 we'll see another spike in the price. 
As for those manipulating the market to drive the price down down down....stop...it's causing a lot of stress on those that jumped into the game late hoping for the moon and leading to me seeing a post like this.

I'd never taken the internet so seriously before And now I take it even more seriously that it's a default subreddit
*sigh* when I invested back in the day (09) I was a junior in high school and did it because I liked the joke of such a currency concept, and when I went to my first bitcoin conference earlier this year I was far too underdressed around my "peers" who didn't even have the investment stash close to mine. 
Times have changed obviously , and so have I. 
Please keep this board clean because we truly are one of the first defenses of bitcoin in the world.
