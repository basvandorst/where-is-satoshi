Not sure if I’m a sadist but I like when I lose... I’ve had a few Bitcoin in the past and lost them due to Ico scams, bad trades, and just plain time wasting? Or was it this has been the best experience of my life getting really onboard last December ”moon”
Has taught me patience that is priceless. I am no longer hungry, and this attitude projects into every element in my life. I found so sort of enlightened point of view through crypto...  Put your crypto in your favorite project, something you truly believe in. Etherium seems to have great potential for future developments in technology. I’m no expert but we are experiencing a renaissance in our own technology. Smile... happiness... moon...
