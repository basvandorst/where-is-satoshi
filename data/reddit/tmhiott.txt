Just google search Asicminer Block Erupters. I think they're like $20 on Amazon.

If anyone is looking at this and says, "hey these look cool and are cheap i'm going to buy some and make bitcoin!" 
DON'T DO IT.  I've had these going since August of 2013.  If I was mining in a pool today I would be making .0001 bitcoins per month. I actually switched them over to the CK Solo Pool just for kicks - i never expect to find a block.

Yes, i'm running it essentially as a 1 in a quadrillion trillion million lottery, and for fun. I just can't bring myself to turn them off. I've replaced the fan 3 times though.

lol...i also have a few shares of AM1 left on Havelock Investments...worst investment ever. 
If I'm not mistaken I bought those at 3.2 BTC each? Now they are at .0071 :/

I still have the cases to mine too! I'll keep them though, one day it'll be a funny story to tell my future grandchildren. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:12:34
lol. 
I bought each of them (9 of them) for 1.8 bitcoins each.
No, I haven't made my money back :p

It is a solo pool.  I could run a full node, but when I set it up I didn't want to have to wait forever to download everything.
I'll go start the download when I get home, and run a full node, why not.

It's been over for a while :/
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:50:47
Honestly? 0. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:41:04
You're completely right.  
But I've been reading for weeks about people putting orders into normal exchanges and them losing their money or people trying to buy btc off of bitinstant and not getting their btc.  
I just want a few btc :/

"It is becoming exponentially more difficult to make transistors smaller."
Was the same thing not said in the 80's, 90's, 2000's?

How hard is it to get 2 factor auth from google added to a website? 
This is a serious question...could theymos do it easily?

Why? If you really want to mine, you can buy Block Erupters for under $30 dollars right now on eBay.  Buy a USB Hub, but a few, and mine that way.  That would be more cost effective (could buy 20-25 erupters for $1000 if you really wanted too) and would be more efficient mining.
