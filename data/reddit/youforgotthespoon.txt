Does the phrase "silver spoon" mean *nothing* to you?
What do you think life is like when a 2% ROI is enough for your entire extended family to live off for a year?
The rich and corrupt don't have to do shit for a living. It's only because some relative of theirs got lucky in finance or politics. It could be generations ago. Once you have $10M, a 1% ROI per annum is $100000. How many families do you think are worth more than $10M? The number is **199,235**. And that's individuals worth more than **$30M**. Each of those individuals potentially represents not just a single person but an entire family living off of capital gains indefinitely.
Where is the jealousy? Do you actually think these people WORK for their money? LOL. absurd.
Let me ask you this: are there less than or more than 200,000 early adopters of Bitcoin? How do we even define an early adopter? Someone who bought for a price less than you? Someone who bought in 2010?
Fact is, if you aren't a member of the lucky sperm club, and you have no political or financial success in your family, you will NEVER attain the same level of wealth or comfort. I think it really grinds on people to know they have most likely missed the one real opportunity they had to strike at rich for little to no cost or risk, doing something they love.
For most of you haters, the worst part about Bitcoin is that you missed it.

What he did is not equivalent to robbing a bank, or breaking into someone's home. He defrauded an economy out of 6% of the total currency units in circulation. That is a very, very serious crime and a huge injustice.
Do you really think it's *justice* to lock up $5-10M of mark's assets and let him walk free as a billionaire or even trillionaire in 5-10 years? Even if he goes to prison, he could buy his way out of prison like Martha Stewart.

People are corrupt. Bitcoiners are equally as corrupt.
In a fiscally responsible world, governments can't afford to go to war, because they actually have to pay for war machines instead of printing dollars out of thin air and vomitting the side effects onto the third world and middle class population.
Bitcoin supplants debt-based inflationary money with highly liquid money of fixed supply. You can bitch about insecurity and whatnot, but at the end of the day, you still have the incentive to protect your savings and watch them grow with a better money. Bitcoin fundamentally changes the relationship between people and their governments.

Most people are sellouts when their livelihood is on the line.
If Ben Lawsky thinks CoinValidation is the only way for Bitcoin to fly in the USA, every major Bitcoin CEO will have to choose between implementing CV and going out of business, or worse. This is my greatest fear going forward. This is the most plausible way for Bitcoin to be destroyed from the inside out.

I very much doubt if biometric scanners and tight monetary controls will be what pays off your mortgage.

Maybe if the BitLicense applies nationally and ends up saving exchange operators money on startup costs. Otherwise, you get the NY license, great, 49 more to go buddy. Wow, isn't the BitLicense just peachy?
Somehow I doubt this will happen on a national scale. Much more likely is that Ben Lawsky will make a name for himself and innovations will be pushed overseas.

You do realize they're going to want to regulate open source Bitcoin wallets with CoinValidation et al, don't you? Barry Silbert of Second Market has already been pushing for open source wallet makers to be regulated in [public speeches]( That's called kicking the ladders, and throwing people under the bus. Expect it.

Ridiculous. Mark didn't rob a bank, or smoke fucking pot. He stole a billion dollars, and he can easily rectify this by returning the funds he has absconded with to their rightful owners.
But until he does so, there have been real suicides over MtGox losses. A guy blew his own brains out with a shotgun in his garage. You don't see that when a guy smokes pot. This is not some victimless crime we're talking about. This is the story of a friend hearing his buddy's wife's blood-curling screams over the phone as she notices her husbands face is gone. The post was removed from r/BitcoinMarkets. Mark has blood on his hands.
No one is ok with some completely unethical fraud having control over 6% of the total supply of Bitcoins. It just isn't right. You're not going to get any of the Bitcoins back through courts or jail time. Won't happen.

Well I do. And I jumped right to "*This time it's different*".
Allowing a small group of insiders to raise barriers to entry will **surely** not harm anyone who isn't an established player with deep pockets. Not at all! Where is the precedent?!!

I'm much less than optimistic. This looks like a move by Lawsky to make a name for himself. Future policy of BitLicenses will be decided by people above Lawsky's level then.
Best case scenario, this will end up being a nuisance in the short term, in the long term, not a fucking chance. I can only speculate on the short term worst case but it probably includes CoinValidation and insane levels of surveillance. In the long term, both are unavoidable no matter what.
I expect this will start out as a nuisance that maybe helps some early players. But that nuisance inevitably will grow into a monster shitpile disaster once insiders have been paid off nicely enough and nobody gives a fuck anymore about what Bitcoin stands for to uphold their principles. That's when the ladders get kicked.
To me this smells like a power grab. Nothing good can come of it.
