I don't know about you, but as for myself, I would be ashamed of myself using propaganda tactics to manipulate others.  Very Sad.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:33:09
Exactly and well put.  You get an upvote
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:19:20
I would suggest to you is spend a little time learning about Propaganda.  Do more then just watch a few videos and/or read something.  Actually spend some time to get it in your head how it works.  Why is it so effective.  If you get that far then you will understand why I reacted to what you posted.  Hopefully you can see how each one of us does it so we can stop it.  Let people decide for themselves how they feel about stuff.
That said I'll try to respond to your questions.  Long term thoughts on bitcoin?  Its tuff to say.  As you noticed; The more popular Bitcoin becomes the more FUD happens around it.  I'm not talking about price I'm referring to usage.  Price is a reaction to Bitcoins usage.  
When I think of Bitcoin and I include the FUD with that thought, it tells me there are a lot of Good and Bad People all excited around Bitcoin.  Banks are antic, Governments are antic, and I'm sure Bad people are antic. (Bad People are the ones who want to take advantage of Bitcoin.  The people who want to destroy by changing or Talented people who want to make their own Crypto instead of develop Bitcoin to succeed.)
-Will Bitcoin have long term adoption.  I sure hope so.  Its up against a ton of stuff.  Banks, Governments, and human nature.  The War hasn't even gotten started yet.  Tuff times are only going to get tougher.
If the developers who stick with Bitcoin (Hopefully bright minds stay instead of go off for glory to make their own crypto) keep the dream in them strong, Nothing will stop Bitcoin.  Almost all the other Crypto's do not have all the working parts that makes Bitcoin what it is.  The King.
-Will the developments keep bitcoin a major contender?  I've gone over all the projects going on in Bitcoin I can find.  
1 Lightning Network; Most people have heard about this one.  Its actually a huge upgrade and very complicated.  Took me awhile to get it in my head how it would work.  If they can code it; it will change everything.  It will take time.
2 Snorr's Signatures; This project is interesting.  It consolidates transactions to be smaller.  Most of the data in a transaction is all the addresses.  This project will reduce those down to one address per transaction.  It will kill all this spam on the network.
3 RSK Rootstock.  When Satashi published Bitcoin he made some changes before doing it.  Satashi actually developed complex Smart Contracts into Bitcoin, but he pulled the code for he felt it was too insecure for the purpose of Bitcoin.  All the OP Codes that is need are still there.  This project wants to bring and develop Smart Contracts just like Etherium To Bitcoin.  
4 Atomic Swaps I'm sure you have read on this.  Lots of people chat about it. 
5 Onion Protocol;  Lightning Network incorporated another project that completely Privatizes transaction in the network called 'Onion' where Transactions only refer to the previous node and the next node a transaction takes to reach its Destination.  That eliminates tracking of where transactions come from.  This works only in Lightning Network Nodes for transaction will travel from Channel to Channel to Channel to reach its Destination.  The beauty of that is it doesn't change what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, but adds to it.
All these projects are huge and best of all they do not change what makes Bitcoin itself work so well.  
We want Community driven projects or we will just end up with new of the same old Systems.
There will always be Hard Forks.  Good ones and Contentious ones.
Hope I put my thoughts down in my post well and did it without too much Positive FUD Propaganda.  I hope I helped you think in more directions.

@_date: 2018-01-06 07:54:23
Sorry, but you need to go back to understanding what Crypto's are all about.  There is no other Coin that is better then Bitcoin.  Its in how it is structured and how every part of it works as a whole.  You can't make judgments based solely on Faster and cheaper.

Yes, Etherium's soon move to Proof of Stake.  
I've spent a ton of time doing my best to understand this whole Crypto Concept.  Peer to Peer Transfer of Value removing the middle man for they have proven themselves untrustworthy.  That is the dream of CryptoCurrencies.  To accomplish that it requires all the parts of what makes crypto that it is.  If you change or leave out something (not saying improve, but change the proccess) that creates exploitable weaknesses in the concept that can be utilized by Governments and Banks and Bad Actors.
Etherium's Development is controlled by just its team.  So is every other Crypto except Bitcoin.  Only people directly within their team can contribute to their code or continue development; So if something happened to someone in the inner circle of each coin you get something thats not of the Dream.  That is not much different then Banks and Government.  What happens to the project when new people replace the original ones or when power corrupts the people who decide what goes on?
All of Bitcoin's development is open sourced.  A community project.  Yes, I do feel that Bitcoin Core is trying to have its way, but even though looking at Github you will see that most additions are not done by Bitcoin Core.  Even with such a strong organized group (they do disagree among themselves too) like Bitcoin Core they can not control the future of Bitcoin.  Just have an effect on it.  Bitcoin is hard to change/destroy/improve for it needs a consensuses not only from coders, but also from everyone who runs their Full Node.  I get to decide which rule set to use.  That is very powerful and a huge value.  
The only strengths other Crypto's have is they can change/improve things at a faster pace.  Yes there are huge interesting things that Crypto Tech can do.  The big question is what are you willing to give up for them in the short term to have them now even before mass adoption happens? For given time and effort Bitcoin can do it all too.
I'm American so 'sad to say' my life it good.  Even knowing all what Government and Banks do my life is good.  My wife is from Kenya so I know of the Hardships others have.  As you can see I have done what I can to understand what is going on in the Crypto World.  What is at stake.  I would never give up what Bitcoin set out to do so I can have short term goals or wants.  Anything less then the Dream is failure. Anything else would be letting them win.  Without the holy trinity of what makes a Crypto will equal they win and the world doesn't change for the better.
You mentioned environmentally-friendly concerning Etherium.  Right now its very bad for them(much worse then Bitcoins footprint), but their move to PoS will improve that.  There are even brighter ideas in the works then PoS.  I've been learning about a Coin that doesn't have any mining operations of any kind.  Just a few Nodes to help tie the network together.  It doesn't run on a block-chain.  All transactions are validated by the users themselves for their own wallet will validate two transactions before sending out its own transaction.  Pretty nifty.  Read deep about Iota and its Tangle.  Don't let the FUD discourage.  Its an interesting project.
P.s. Learn the Propaganda.  When you say this 'If that's the case, then I think Bitcoin either needs to change in this way or people should change to Ether' is saying there is a: problem/creating a problem/pointing out a problem, then giving a solution that you want to see by suggesting is propaganda.  In my whole post I shared my knowledge and thoughts without telling you we need to do this to solve anything talked about.  So many people just love to present/create problems then offer their solutions.

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:10:19
I'll give you a few points of Advice.  It will be your job to expand on them.  Some of my ideas you wont like at all.
Hold on to that job ! and get a second Job so you can replace your loses in Crypto Trading and rebuild your portfolio.
Cut cost of living expenses.  Learn what the family needs and what it does not need.
Crypto's is going to change the world.  Learn what makes Crypto's.  Why it has captured so much attention.  What gives it value.  Only put your funds in those projects.  And then don't mess with it.  There is a reason why Hodle is so much talked about everywhere by everyone.
Rich people have become that way because they Found Value in something before others or they Created Value in something.  Investing/Traders is really the attempt to find value before others do.
Bitcoin is king and it always will be for a few reasons.  Its how all the parts of it work together.  Learn exactly what is and how Bitcoin exactly works.
My Portfolio has only a few different Coins.  Right now, I have only 4 different Crypto's.  Thats it.  Even after all these dips each of them are still Green.  You need to find coins that have a mission.  Bitcoin's mission is to replace Fiat currency as an example.  I also like Iota.  They have a solid mission too.  I also like OmiseGo.  There are quite a few Crypto's that are carving out their own place, but there are many that are just trying to be the next Bitcoin or the next Etherium.   Look for ones that are out to replace current industries or fill a need for the future tech that is so talked about. (Internet of Things example)  I love the thought of a Crypto that will bridge or create a easy road between Fiat and Crypto.  Something like that will be huge as more and more people put their money into and use crypto.  Thats why I have OmiseGo in my Portfolio.  Don't know if Omg is the best one, but Remittance Payments will be the biggest influx in the coming years.  Migrant workers from around the world can send their payments back home without having to find some bank miles away?  They can do it right from the fields their working in.  Beautiful.
Avoid the hypes and learn to spot them.  Tron is prime example.  Avoid the crypto's that just talk fancy pointless talk.  Forget the ones that talk about office networking.  Those things are not going to change how the world works.  Fiat bridge to Crypto,  Internet of Things,  Remittance Payments, Privacy.  All those things are huge.
Day Trading.......Not advisable.  I don't do it.  I played around a few times.  First time I made 3x in just 20 mins, but then saw the price tank afterwards.  Day Trading isn't about what investing is.  Finding value in something before others do; then holding that till it reaches your value point is what Investing is. 
And most important.  Realize the war hasn't even started.  The enemies of Crypto(Governments, Banks) have barely done a thing yet.  Tuff times are still coming.  Thru out history Governments and Banks have done anything and everything to maintain control over peoples lives.  Doesn't matter what country.  They all do it and they all will sacrifice lives to maintain it.  Keep that in mind.

We are all allowed to do as we wish.  I get that.  Its not a good idea to take decisions away from others by not letting them now 'how something works'.  
For the longest time I didn't know what exactly a full node did.  I've been in Bitcoin since 2014.  I'm proud now I keep my Node up 24/7.  Every few days I give my computer a rest for a couple of hours.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:59:05
You should let people know everything.  There are people working on a project called 'RSK Rootstock' 
The creator of Bitcoin actually had the code in Bitcoin for complex Smart Contracts before going public, but he pulled it out for he didn't feel it was secure enough.  All the OP Codes are there for Bitcoin to do the same things Etherium and other Coins can do.   is trying to develop these OP Codes to compliment Bitcoin.
There is a lot going on in the development of Bitcoin.  You shouldn't spew out FUD and Propaganda.  Your statements of 'It doesn't matter, this isn't enough to save Bitcoin.'  Your so full of crap.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:43:53

And its going to get much more tougher as things move along.  We can only put hope in the developers behind bitcoin.  That they still have the dream in them.  If it fails we all will get nothing out of this.  Life will go on with the same screwed up Governments, Banks, and Society.

Thought I'd share another example of how Lightning Network.  This was posted earlier.
[–]HammerIsMyName [score hidden] 23 minutes ago 
It's called "Lightning Network" not "Lightning Channel" - The idea is that when you open a channel you can pay anyone through that channel, as long as there's a path between you and the person you're trying to pay on the network. The same way servers on the internet don't connect directly to the server you want to reach. They bounce back and forth between hundreds of other servers before finding their way to the intended endpoint.

Introducing Bitcoin to others is actually a bit hard to break through everything they've already learned about money.

Finding ways to cope with any amount of stress is always good.  Be careful about Limit Orders.  Crypto's will never go away.  The Pandora's Box has been opened.  
So many people have lost funds due to Limit Orders.  With how Crypto's prices move so much; it becomes so easy for Limits to be hit, triggered, and then Price moves back up, leaving you on the sidelines.  Its Limit Orders that have half the blame for lots of the movement in prices.  Its almost like Dynamo's 
I myself, just leave Limits out of all my trades.  I decide.  Not the market.  Hopefully I explained myself well.

The order of the day for Media companies is?
Bottom line is you have to decide on what your going to believe in.  Either believe in what you did before hand or let someone else change what you believe in.
I would suggest learning about what is Propaganda.  Learn how it is used so you can recognize when its being used.  Don't let others drag you done the road of life.

Here we are with something special and everyone is out for themselves.  All these smart people should be working on Bitcoin, make sure that succeeds, instead they just want their own projects.

"Until crypto solves that problem'  Thats not a crypto's problem. Thats a person's problem.  Crypto does not sell itself and buy itself, then sell itself again.  What your seeing is greed in action.  Your seeing people trying to fatten their holdings.  On a bigger picture your seeing people trying to find what is the value of Crypto's.  
You fail to see what is going on.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:24:38
They declared Crypto's to be Assets, not property like Land and Buildings.

Follow the advice from this post to get your private keys from Bread wallet.  
	
Re: Where is the BTC address in Bread Wallet
July 04, 2017, 06:36:39 PM
Reply with quote  
No. The BTC address you see is an encoded version of the "public" key that matches the "private" key. The private key (ie. "The Digital Key") is exactly that... private. You don't want that to be shared.
You can derive the public key from the private key... but you can't get the private key from the public key. Which is why you can give your BTC address to someone, and they can't steal your bitcoins Smiley
AFAIK,Breadwallet does not allow you to export the private keys directly for your addresses. However, Breadwallet is a Heuristically Deterministic (or HD) wallet. This means that with the "seed" (the 12 words you should have written down and safely stored) you can always restore the complete wallet and all addresses it has (and will) ever contain. The seed is essentially the starting point that ALL the private keys in your wallet are generated from.
Breadwallet uses "standard" BIP39 seeds... so should you ever need access to a specific private key for a specific address, you can create an offline copy of this website: 
Enter your seed where is says "BIP39 Mnemonic", click "BIP32" under "Derivation Path", select "Custom" from the "Client" dropdown box... and enter m/0'/0 in the Derivation Path and all your receive addresses and private keys will be generated below. You would then need to change the Derivation Path to m/0'/1 and see all your change addresses as well.
So, to sum up... if you have the "12 word seed" that Breadwallet generated, then you CAN get all the private keys, Breadwallet just tries to keep them all hidden, which is a "Good Thing"™
I have done exactly this.  I would be careful.  Go offline once you load up 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:18:46

Total Propaganda.  Bitcoin has nothing to do with investing and nothing to do with shares.

Exodus is pretty user friendly.  They make sure when you create your wallet that you can easily recover it by email.  Thats as friendly as it gets.
Now some of those points you said is just not what Crypto's is all about.  Crypto's is about taking responsibility for your funds for yourself.  Not giving up control of your funds to others so you feel protected.

The kind of people who brought us the Home Computer.  The Cell Phone.  Then those people brought us Smart Phones.  These people now see a future that they want.  And I saw the determination in them.  They want a future where they have control of their money.  These people are excited in what Crypto's can do.  They want to write their future and build a society they see.
I'm betting that they will not stop.  I'm betting they will succeed.

I wouldn't put the blame on Donald Trump.  This was rank and file Politicians.  Its all them Senators and Congressmen who did this.  It seems more like an 'write in' to Trump's Plan which the long time Politicians forced onto Trump, because they were not going to pass anything without stuff they wanted.  
All the Politicians want you, 'They want you poor, unhealthy and stupid.'

dgfdfdfdfd, your wrong and Quintall is correct.  Most people don't care at all.....They care about security, and that the system works.  Most people understand that Technology is always improving.  
I've seen your name before.  You go post  from place to place rallying up peoples emotions.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:03:47
Ok, your new to BTC.  Lots of people are.  
Let me tell you all this High Fees and stuff, long transaction time is just propaganda.  It means nothing.  Its just something to push peoples buttons.  Drag them down the road.  Get you to make decisions that they want you to make.  
No one cares about transaction fees or time.  They care about it getting there.  I care that when I send funds to family in Africa that it gets there.  All this yacking about is Propaganda because people want you to make decisions that lead to mistakes.
There are huge differences to Bitcoin and the other Cryptos.  Its why Bitcoin is still top dog and will stay top dog.  Decentralized.  No one controls Bitcoin.  Not even Bitcoin Core controls Bitcoin.  All these other Coins are not open Sourced as Bitcoin is.  Their code maybe, but not in its development.  Only their team members are working on the code.  Try to understand what that means.
So many new people in crypto's and they don't even really understand why its been happening.  Bitcoin is about freedom of your Resources from other people control of it.
Bitcoin is working on pushing itself forward.  Theres Lightning Network and Rootstock coming out.  I've been reading a bit on them.  Check those things out.  Next year will be interesting.

ismith23, most people care more about Btc security and that their funds reach their destination.  My friends in Kenya are always happy when I send them Btc.  They don't care that sometimes it takes awhile and I don't care that the fees are sometimes a bit high.  What matters is I can send them funds and that they get it.
All these things people are crying over means small beans and will get resolved soon enough  All these loud mouths just want to push people's buttons.

MrNotSoRight is correct.  Gold is traditionally Money.  Fiat Currency is not money.  It is Currency.  Fiat came about from a process where people noticed the populace was fine with trading Gold Certificates(Gold IOU's) instead of exchanging actual Gold.
Fiat would be all fine and everyone would be happy with it.  The only problem is people can't keep their fingers out of the cookie jar.

Life is not fair and we can't make it fair either.  Mankind left fairness when we started organizing ourselves into larger and larger groups.  You should stop worrying about society and worry about you and your family for thats all you have.
I'm bitter on this subject for what propaganda thats feed to people has caused so much harm.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:54:12
You don't listen do you.  Crypto's is not about relying on others, its about taking responsibility for your own life.  Either learn about what this is all about or get the Hell out of here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:42:43
Let me teach you something.  Have you ever learned about Propaganda?  Its actually an amazing subject.  Read how it works, learn how to recognize it.  For Propaganda is very strong.  Once it gets going its near impossible to stop it.  The people in Russia couldn't stop it.  People in China and many other countries couldn't stop it.  America is having a tuff time dealing with it.
Learn that what you say in a public setting effects what other people think.  You brought it up.  That only means you do like the Idea.  Don't try to kid me saying, 'just seeing what others think.' 
Just Remember 'I hate the Idea'  You want to think about exchanges read up on 'DEX's' that will be coming out.  Decentralized Exchanges.
Dumb ass people like you thinking your so smart with these questions and suggestions.  What you think about this and what you think about that.  Forming your suggestions that this could be a good idea. 
No wonder there has always been people who rule over the masses

I'll talk on your first point.  Too massive to overcome.  Bitcoin does not need to overcome anything.  It will do what it was designed to do.  
They will have to stop Bitcoin from doing its mission.  Regulations won't do anything but create a bumpy transition.
To stop Bitcoin and Crypto's Government and Banks will have to shut down the Internet.   Completely take it down and outlaw it.  Businesses and Banks have now become too dependent on the Internet.  They wouldn't know what to do without it.

You ever heard of that Term 'Try hard enough and one can convince themselves anything?  
Yes, there are some Countries where UBI is being used and it does some good.  Kenya is a good example.  
Most people who participate in the program do things to ease the burdens on their lives.  While some actually try to use the program to create a value which they can offer to other.  It works there for those Countries it is harder to survive.
I should say I'm American.  In countries like America it would be disastrous.  
Try doing nothing for a week or Month or Year?  Easy to do.   
My last word is 'Be very careful of what one wishes for.'  
Lastly, why are you preaching for UBI, then also so your not Pro UBI?  Some kind of Propaganda Mind Trick?

I will just have to share this.  Take it for what its worth.  
I've been driving for Uber here and there for the past year.  I bring up Bitcoin every time when I feel the rider may be open to the subject.  
At first no one heard about it or when they did they just new some basic stuff.
Amazingly, I once gave someone a ride to the airport who was one of the very early adapters from 2009 
Nowadays More and more people either have some or excited about Bitcoin.

That is very well said.  I couldn't say it better.
I'll add to it though.
When it comes to Bitcoin its more important to be secure and decentralized.  That just means it takes longer to find the right solutions to other concerns.
Today's price reactions in the markets is more about the Tax Plan that was passed.  Crypto to Crypto exchanges will now be taxed.  Thats pretty creative way of attacking Bitcoin and the Crypto World.
Just remember Government is never your friend.  Have a nice talk with all your representatives. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:13:50

@_date: 2017-12-24 11:33:30
OneleeKO, you like many of the new people who have brought some Crypto's have gotten into something you haven't spent time thinking what its all about.  Your wondering why you should keep Hodling.  You want to sell and Grab Fiat or an Alt.  Only you can take the time and put your brain to what is Bitcoin.  Only you can get your head around 'what is your gut feeling' and what is 'Outside influence' or am I being too Impatient.
I myself will be hodling my BTC till full Adoption.
Reddit is not the best place to get answers to your questions.  Watch Andreas's Videos on Youtube.  Watch as many of his videos as you can.  Especially when he had a talk with the Banking Regulators of Canada.  That video is very telling of what to expect in the Near Future.  That man thinks much further then most of us Reddit Posters
Just remember you and I are only 2 people in this whole world.  Its important to take into account of all the other people too.  
I see lots of people fully excited about what Bitcoin is doing.  I see even though Bitcoin has got some growing pains most volume is with Bitcoin.  All these traders are bitching, but they are still Buying Btc more then anything else.  
When I bring up Crypto's when talking to people (I drive Uber on my spare time) some of them know of Bitcoin now.  Before no one ever did a year ago.  They don't know there are even Alt Coins.  Only 2 people in the past year know there are other Crypto's
I have only met one person who felt Bitcoin is outdated and inferior tech as you say.
Food for thought;
Bitcoin started on a small forum in 2008.  December to be exact so most just say 2009.  A Cryptographers Forum.  Not exactly a popular place.
Just last month a man paid his Dowery in Bitcoin instead of the Traditional Cow and kettle to his wife's family in Kenya.  
Just last month someone took a picture of a Produce stand in Haiti that accepts Bitcoin for payment.
Bitcoin has spread around the world and it all started from a forum post.

Yup.  I still remember watching the chats on Exchanges.  Lots of Chaos.  Through out all this time I still haven't exchanged a single one back to Fiat.  I've brought things with Bitcoin.  Software clothes.  Never came across a Coffee Shop who accepted Bitcoin.  I used to be a Latte or two a day type.  Guess thats good for me....Probably wouldn't have any left if I did. 
I Don't touch Coffee anymore.

Zooil ....  Bluethunder is completely right.  Bitcoin isn't an investment.  These days its getting harder and harder to find real information on what Bitcoin actually is.  Everywhere one goes to look one gets exposed to mostly this talk about Investment.
Bitcoin is a Public Ledger which anyone anywhere can use.  That is probably the shortest answer to what Bitcoin is.  Just looking over to the right hand side of this page explains more of what Bitcoin is.  ----------&gt;

I'm American and my Wife I meet in Kenya.  We send money(Not BTC) back home to help support our family there.  Pretty simple.
Kenya is pretty stable, but may not always be.  If the worst were ever to happen over there and Economic sanctions were placed on Kenya for whatever reason, I would still be able to send family  money by sending BTC instead of Fiat to help support our family.  Thats one of my reasons I highly value BTC.  20,000 per is chump change.

Please make more of an effort to show the difference between Bitcoin and all the other Coins.  
Talk about how its grown organically from just a few people mining at home to a full industry, that the Bitcoin Code isn't owned by any one team or group. 
The Bitcoin Program was freely given to the public. Express how it grew from a Post on a Forum and spread all around the world in such a short time.
Point out that Bitcoin had No Ico's where founders get up to "half" of the Coins;  when they too could have done the same as Bitcoin.
Describe what it takes to adopt new code.  Help more people understand just how tough and strong Bitcoin is.  More people should understand that its a good thing its so hard to make changes to how Bitcoin works.  Helps one sleep soundly at night.
And do remind people that All the other Coins are privately owned.  Only the Team gets to decide what goes on with their Code. Fine if someone likes the current team of a project, but those people won't be around forever, and then your forced to trust.  Not much different then what we already do today.
Those things are important.

You'd be surprised how true it is...If it wasn't true there wouldn't be this craze want for Crypto's
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:24:46
I think rdavis is right or atleast closer to the mark.  There would be a lot of people who would sell their coins under the radar.  Sad so many still love that Fiat.
The smart rich are putting their coins in those bomb bunker cold storage sites we hear about at times.

I always have this little scene going on in my mind of a few nondescript works with brooms and those dust pans sweeping up little pieces of garbage traders throw away. No one knows who is buying when you sell/trade ya bits.
They collecting. 
I've brought things with my BTC, but I have never sold/traded any of mine.

MalcolmRoseGaming  I'm not going to try to be elegant.  I've learned people can convince themselves and or others of anything if they try hard enough.  
Bitcoin isn't an asset.  It isn't anything that the Governments or Financial Sectors or greedy people want to call it.  Right now your tied up into 'How can I create more wealth for myself' just like many other people are.  ETF's means more money going in to Crypto's so it means more money for me.  
Any form of ETF's is just another attempt to try to make Bitcoin something that its not.  Greedy People want others to look at Bitcoin as an Asset/Investment because they don't want you to think of it as a Currency.
Bitcoin is a ledger.  A Public Ledger most people can look up to see what Addresses have what Bitcoin.  Thats what Bitcoin is.  
Have you ever learned about Propaganda?  How it works?  The Human characteristics of people who practice Propaganda?  These people never stop.  On and on spewing their poison at people till it becomes impossible to withstand.  And if they come across someone who is wise and not fooled, they run to someone else to spew their poison at.  Never stop till they get what Greed tells them is best.
I know you will still try to convince people otherwise.  That its an asset/investment.  All this is done to get people greedy and trade away their hard earned coins before it even succeeds.  
I hope your ways catch up to you some day.  I see already one person sees right through you and your snake oil.
Good Job DelfinGuy.  I've seen you around the board fighting the good fight. Much respect from me to ya.  Sad to say there is no teaching these kinds of people.  Win a battle here or there, but they won't ever stop.
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:03:53
I too see that.  No question about it.  A war is coming.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:19:48
What you say here isn't exactly what happened.  Its a free space where everyone is allowed to participate.  No one can tell others what to do and what not to do.  What your seeing happening is natural instinct of Greed that everyone has.  I can tell you don't approve and I too don't ( I don't sell and trade flip.  The fiat I've put in is not going back)
As a bitcoin old timer, I talk to everyone.  At work, at stores, with friends and family.  Not a single person I meet where bitcoin isn't brought up.  That is more then any ad or Facebook can ever do.
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:07:24
Oh you bet they are doing that right now.  They prefer the current Fiat system, but ya can count on it 'They are stacking hard' just in case.  Thats how wealthy people are.  Hedge their bets.

luke jr. is correct.   Bitcoin has always had smart contracts.  Satoshi had coded it in, but sometime before posting he decided to retract most of the code.  He felt it wasn't secure enough.  Rootstock's main goal is reinstating/updating the code while moving all of the contracts to a side chain.

Spot on, Miz4r......I found the light on 17th Dec 2014.  I'll never forget that day
@_date: 2018-05-08 09:28:39
Yup.  All kinds of Bitcoiners.  Then the whole world would buy Bitcoin.  U.S. has pissed off way too many.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:43:10
You said this;
'What about the private keys from Satoshi? What if some Adolf gets them some day? He can pretty much do whatever the fuck he wants."
You Germans still don't take the time to learn real history.  What a shame.  Strange you can see how People in Power can change perspectives, do dirty secret deals behind everyone's backs, lie about everything, all this to hold power over people......
But you can't even see how its been used against your own Country and its history.
Germany was bombed, Fire Bombed, Strifed, then massive campaign to turn Work Camps into Concentration Camps.  All because Adolf challenged Britians Control over the World. That Adolf kicked out the Rothschild Central bank to start issuing Currency back by Labor.  Adolf even jailed a Rothschild and wouldn't give him up for some time. 
Oh the Brits just could not let that happen.  The British government didn't care that people (Yours and theirs) were going to die.  They just wanted Control.  All they ever do care about.
You should learn your real history, bigfish h.  Not this garbage they teach you in school.  Its a big confusing world out there.  Just think, your believing in the stories from enemies that your grandparents faught against.  Your believing the stories the victors wrote without even knowing what the loser had to say.
I bet you've never listened to any of his speeches.  So much you don't know about.  We have Crypto's today because Adolf and Germany lost the war.  We wouldn't have this Debt based Monitory Policy that Countries are run on.  
What a shame.  Do most Germans feel the same as you?  You guys so afraid of learning the truths that it might land you in jail?  I know ya all put an old lady in Jail for speaking the truth.  At least she had pride.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:10:30
You fucking Germans....  Your Generation from the War didn't deserve what happened to them, but the current one sure does.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:29:36
I'm proud that I've read many of the Nuremberg Trials records.  Its very interesting what actually happened as compared to whats told to people.  Everyone are so positive they know what happened, but no one has read anything.  People love following the Sheep.  
Here is a claim made in the Nuremberg Trials....The Germans burned prisoners in open grills at Belzec Camp.  
First, they were gassed using a diesel Engine from a captured Russian Tank(Thats very hard to do kill someone using diesel exhaust for it contains a lot of oxygen), then they buried all the dead in huge pits.  As they started to lose the war, its claimed the Germans dug all the bodies up, then piled the bodies 30 feet high with wood between each layer onto iron grates to be burned.  The women on the bottom layers for they burned hotter and longer so the fire would burn all night.  
Talk about BS.  This was claimed at the Nuremberg Trials.  Thats what you believe happened except you were never told these things.  
Talk about making a story that is so shocking any fool would believe.  Just like the Witch Hunt during the Middle Ages.  The more one digs into History the more pathetic it is.  People fall for these stories to damn easy.
My life is doing just fine, but its so sad that no one ever takes time out of their greedy lives to learn about things that are important.
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:19:20
BlockEnthusiast, you can argue all you want.  Its ok you don't get the full depth of what Crypto is.  Every single Coin/Token is controlled and owned by its small group of Developers.  Everyone loves Vitalik.  I do. 
 Very cool guy.  And I'm sure in each project there are people to like.  But I don't know him.  I don't worship him or anyone else.  And I don't trust people I don't know.  
If Vitalik was such a saint then he would have done as Satoshi did.  Post up Ethereum and let the chips fall as the do.  But he did an ICO, reserved a bunch of coins for themselves.  Just like all the rest of them.  
None of these people will be guiding their project forever.  Then your back to trusting a 3rd party who has control of what happens.  
In a true Crypto decisions have to go thru a huge process to become accepted.  This takes a lot of effort from many people who all have different views on whats best in their interests. This means I can rest at night that someone like Vitalik or any of the others who started Projects can't just cheat or game the system so easily. 
Head back to Crypto School.

Photateo, remember the '.wallet' file is most important.  When making a wallet a few files is created and saved usually in C:\users\'name'\Documents folder  plus a folder by the name of the wallet.
Make a copy of them and save it some where other then your computer.  If anything ever goes wrong you can always import these files.  
Right now I am trying to discover my '.wallet' file which got deleted. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 07:20:20
Believed he used something like this website.......
Do read a lot about wallets as you can.  Completly understand-&gt; how it works; how to import from paper to program or online-exchange; how to add/check balance or existing wallet. ect ect. 
One thing is you can have as many of them as you like.  A buying wallet; selling wallet; personnel storage wallet; gift wallets (create a wallet put something in it and give it away to a friend)
Before getting into all of this make sure you plan it out to stay organized.

Interestingly, I've learned that institutions have been busy in the Crypto field.  I'm sure you've seen the article on Bank of America have been filing and trying to get patents passed since 2014. I bought my first Coin back then.  So, yea, It was a surprising read to find out they are already trying sneaky things behind our backs.   Facebook and Apple have tried too.  So more have been going on that no one knows about.

You need to go back to studying how the Bitcoin Blockchain works.  You've twisted things to support your view point using your well spoken words.
Anyone listening to him; don't get hoodwinked into thinking that home nodes don't matter.  Home Nodes are part of the whole puzzle that makes Bitcoin work as it does.  Each piece is needed or the whole thing won't work as it does.
There are many people out there who would love nothing more then tear down Bitcoin.

I'm sure they said everything they can think of to deter people from using Bitcoin.  Same thing can be said about any subject.  Politics get this kind of propaganda in spades.  News Agencies are far from reporting news anymore.  
What I'm saying is learn for yourself and come up with your own decisions.  Its hard, but can be done.

@_date: 2018-06-29 08:22:35
Yes. Both parties do this.  I don't support any of them.
But whats going on is much deeper then meets the eye.  Anyone who has studied up on Propaganda might be able to see through everything.  From what I'm seeing people are looking at the wrong thing and coming up with the wrong solutions.  They are not connecting the Dots.  They are letting their emotions and wants guide them.  Number one tactic of Propaganda is push peoples buttons and desires.
What gots me thinking is what do all these different groups have in common.  Lots involved.  Democrats, Republicans, News Media, Hollywood, political action groups.  Thats a lot of different groups of people all pushing for trouble.  Don't exclude Republicans from this list.  They too want the same thing.
Same thing going on in America is same shit going on in Europe....That just expands the list.  What can possibly have a connection to all these players around the world?
People need to start thinking what is in common with all these groups.  Won't be able to solve stuff till then.

I go out and buy myself a Beer.  Sometimes I hit the forums to see what people are saying.  Just to judge the sentiment.
And I have never sold any of my stack at any point in time.  Spikes up or Free Fall Willy days.
My fav thoughts on these days is asking my self ------
'There is some kind of Power in Bitcoin' 'Something is going on much bigger then Me'
'Don't go messing up my biggest chance'
Some of Us get all excited by what goes on in Prices.  Lots of people try to chase it around and I've seen some clips of peeps doing some amazing stuff.  A lot of the price action is just that.  Hordes of people chasing the price causing momentum.
Its a decision each of us has to make.  I made up my mind.  Stack and Stack.  I learned I'm no expert and Bitcoin is just too important to learn as I go.

I've got the feeling from reading this is that you've thrown a bunch of different concepts into one bucket.

I'll say thats the first time I've heard expressed that way. 
Bitcoin was created to solve a different problem.  It solves a trust problem.  And it solves a sharing/trading of value between people problem.

You forgot the biggest and most important group.....The Disrupters.  The ones like me who believe Bitcoin is going to change everything in our Society.  All this investing talk is just a side effect.  It means so little.  Its just Bitcoin eating up Fiat.
Listen to what Rick Falkvinge says about whats going to happen down the road as Bitcoin Spreads around the world.  
It was Nov of 2008 
(most people just say 2009) when Bitcoin's White Paper/Program was posted on a cryptographers Forum.  Not many people visited that site at all.  Just this week a man in Kenya decided to offer up a dowry of Bitcoin to his wife's family and they were so happy for that.  
Hate to say it, but you are focusing your thoughts on the simple things.  Spend more time thinking of why Bitcoin is so valuable to people.
So yes, enjoy the ride up and HODL all the way.  Just the fact that your in here means your one of the very lucky ones.

I run my own full node.  Its a bit complicated and there are many guides you can find just by searching the web on how to set it up.
For a full node only two things one needs to do.  Forward port 8333 and have a 'static Ip Address'  Sometimes depending on ISP and equipment it can be tricky to accomplish.
Hardest part is forwarding your 8333 port to talk with the bitcoin network.  Each modem and ISP do things differently make getting it done hard.  I use Port Mapper.  Small program that does it all for you.
Next thing is making your internet static. I couldn't get that done but found that 'Port Forward Network Utilities' does that for me (I use trial version)  A simple program that does many things for the paid version, but the trial will make your IP address static.  The trial does not have a time limit.  Some times the 'DHCP' Server acts up and you have to release it, go back to Dynamic, then make static again. The paid version might be worth it for it automates the whole proccess.  
Two easy programs lets me run my own Full Node.  Get the ropes on how to use these and your set.

I myself, have been trying to figure that out.  I don't know what exactly is different about a full node and mining.  I know the basics, but I don't know how the two interact with the network.  Why do we need both?  Why can't Mining be the full nodes?  And I haven't come across a place that easily explains it all.

Maybe your thoughts on money is a little off.  Money is a concept, not an item or thing.
And how are you going to reach new levels of thought if you already have a negative opinion on something?
Your analogy of Dog and Cat Shit is actually how it works.  This thing called 'Money'.  People getting together and agreeing to somethings worth.
To say gold was always valuable is a bit stretching.

Thank you for your post, and others who state real reasons why things are as they are.
I been running my full node for years now. 
I remember some people where yapping on the forums that people don't need to run a Full Node.  That it Doesn't do anything or Costs too much.  This started around 2015 when I first read them.  Just BS.  Terrible people spreading lies which just puts everyone/Network behind.
Most of this stuff  "Under the Hood" is way beyond me, but its easy enough to tell how important a Full Node is.  So I run one all the time, though it Took a little help from my brother to open my port :)   
( I'm looking into getting one of those FN/LN set ups soon.  Been holding off for I'm terrible with line commands)
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:28:31
Thanks for letting me know this.  I'll save your link.
What I was hoping to do was get one of those small single-board computer set ups to run everything on.  Would let me turn off my Computer :)
I'm sure my brother would love to help set one up for me, but I've been concerned with maintaining the SBC.  I wouldn't know what to do if it needed attention.
Is there a Rasberry Pi kind of setup which is mostly plug-n-play out yet? 
Or would it be a better idea to pick up a laptop (windows 10) for someone like me who just have a terrible time trying to remember all these command lines?
If something went wrong with a SBC, I'm sure there is some kind of Factory Reset on these?  That would be easy to get back up running.
Hope I wrote this post out well :)

I just watched someone set up their Casa Node on YouTube.  Very Cool.  Connecting it right to the Router and accessing it on the Computer.  Very Cool.  Power the Casa Node on a small Backup Power Supply and I'll be set.  (I do get power outages at times)

The USD is not extremely Stable.  USD seems stable when looking at it year to year.  Seems stable when comparing to Bitcoin.
In my 49 years of life I've seen USD's Value go down down down.  Every year it buys less.  Just during my lifetime it buys only 1/4th.
During USD's Lifetime its lost over 99% of its Value.
I see most here are thinking to fast and not exactly thinking forward.
Just let go of trying to justify ones thinking....be it from fear or spitefulness.
I introduced my brother to Bitcoin back in 2013 and he never brought any.
Asked him why many times.  He's finally told me last month he was just too afraid.

I'm more with DelfinGuy on this.  I've done a bit of reading on this Fractional Reserve Banking.  Came across some interesting History on how it all happened.  Some pretty serious wars happened in Europe over the Gold Merchants who held peoples gold in exchange for certificates.  
These early bankers noticed that people used these Certificates as if it was money.  Exchanging them for goods and services.  It was simpler then going to get their gold from the vaults.
People then started to notice how wealthy these early bankers flaunting their wealth.  So people did the first bank runs asking for their gold back for their certificates.  Wars broke out over this and we can easily determine the Banks won.  They made it legal for banks to Loan out Money they don't actually have.

I think that maturing will happen. 
Most of us think about our experiences and current time....But the next generation is growing up in this new Crypto Era.  I bet the people just getting out of high School, just getting into high School, will easily be able to take up the responsibility of managing their own finances more so then me and my generation who only have known 'Banks'
Yes, I ponder about BobWalsch's concern/Opinion often.  And I'm sure many people will get wrecked by mistakes they make.  I too have lost 1 bitcoin from accidentally formatting a hard-drive.
I do feel the next Generation and one after will grasp how it all works much easier just as they dived into Smart Phones...they will dive into Cryptos too.

I just scanned over the Congressionalblockchaincaucus website.  I noticed something quickly....They didn't even mention Bitcoin at all.  Not once.  Just remember that.
@_date: 2018-07-07 08:55:35
That is very bad design.  Value I worked for today will be less tomorrow because those in authority has decided to inflate the supply of Bank Notes. Don't ever forget why Satashi created Bitcoin.

Well said.  People need to start thinking of a different kind of Economy then one based on Borrowing to grease the wheels.  I tried saying something along these lines, but most people have a hard time thinking past something they have been taught all their lives.

Hodl is not day trading.  Hodl is not panic selling your Bitcoins when the market is going down hill.
One thing about message boards...Ya think everyone thinks just like you or they should....
Ewokjed is correct.  Hodling is not panic selling.
But your one itsy voice pushing what you think.

Am I supposed to laugh?  From your words here I can't tell if you feel that its OK to steal peoples hard earned value or if you feel there is a better way.  
Most of us here fully know the devaluing of the U.S. Dollar has been on purpose.  That just points to why Fiat systems always die.

Goldman Sacs was reputable....
Lemann Brothers was reputable.....
I can list many highly regulated and audited no name penny stock boiler rooms
They all cheat when ever they can...how ever they can.  With whom ever they can.
Gold ETF's is one crazy mess that I hope never happens within Bitcoin.
Just do some research on how Fractional Reserve Banking came about.

You can bet your house Jamie Dimon knows exactly what Bitcoin is.  Why else would he be upset and scared to death of whats going on.  He's trying his best to scare others to not get into Bitcoin.  Jamie boy sees a world that he can't control

When I first brought Bitcoin just one month later I went red for almost 3 years.  Only reason I'm way in the Green is I Hodled.
Patience brother.

I just looked at that.  Maybe that could be for someone who doesn't really believe in the purpose of Crypto's, but I for one....Don't trust nobody !

Your difficulty is that your looking at this wrong.  Economic Wealth is a representation of all things one has accumulated/Earned.  In our current Economic Model its mostly represented by Fiat Cash.  
  What your actually referring to or thinking about as unfair is the Transfer of Wealth from one Economic System to a different one.  Once this Transfer Stage is over everything will work just like it is today.  One will get paid for products/services in Crypto and one will pay for services/products with crypto.  What will change is the rules will apply to everyone equally.  Bitcoin always follows the rules.
This Transfer isn't an organized exchange.  Its made of people who don't agree with the current system and prefer this newer system.  
You touched on fairness in your post.  Nothing about life is fair.  And you can't change that.  What you can do is make sure you have some Bitcoin now instead of later, for when things really get moving its going to be a Mad Rush.

Your bringing up points that don't mean anything.  What Bitcoin is about

From what I've heard is that an Asian Country deemed Bitcoin can be used as a legal Tender to repay a debt.

I'm not going to log in or make an account on that site, so I'll post it here.
Christine, Bitcoin is something else.  Looking forward to the years ahead as all Money is consumed by it.  The Policies of the Fed has ruined its reputation as 'Trustworthy.'   Nicely I don't have to trust anyone with Bitcoin.  Thats the Value of it.  You guys have dipped your hands in the Cookie Jar way too long.
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:03:07
YRuafraid, I actually met someone who used his bitcoins for drugs.  I remember laughing at him a bit.  Sadly, he barely knows anything about what bitcoin is and can be.
@_date: 2017-07-10 23:34:05
I've heard its best to get a the Bitcoin Core Wallet and download the whole Blockchain and put your coins in the wallet when done.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:51:56
If your interested in learning what people are doing with Bitcoin(outside of the drugs and speculation), then look into what people are doing with whats called 'The Block-chain'.  Block-chain is part of the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work.
You will find a bunch of programmers who are busy dreaming a new future.  They are making new businesses(my fav is IOTA) and creating new concepts of how society will function in the future.  Ideas like 'The Internet of Things' and 'Machine to Machine' Economy.  Decentralizing Venture Capitalism ideas from MyBit.  
I'm 47 and I remember when my high school got its first Computer.  I remember a time when no one had phones in their pockets.  Things are actually changing fast.  Bitcoin's whitepaper came out in 2009.  In just eight years and some months later techies are talking about how there are going to be Machines (with built in Sensors) that  communicate with each other to complete tasks.  
The more I read about all this I saw something.  They are determined.  This is the future our generation sees for itself.  These developers want  a future of Cryptos and government can't stop them.

Here is the link to Bitcoin Core website "Releases' 
After downloading the latest client you will have to have a big space to dedicate the Blockchain file.  Its over 140 gigs and will take awhile to complete.  I've got spare hard-drive thats big enough for all my media and back ups.  
Once its done(it will take hours), you move all your bitcoins over to the Bitcoin Core Wallet.  Do the usual safety measures.
Its not the prettiest wallet, so you can chose what to do after what ever happens.  I personally like Exodus as my main wallet.

@_date: 2013-12-29 10:01:50
the wallet wasn't on my main hard drive. So guess thats the good news for me.  
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:30:41
How it happened..Long story..
I brought my coin on Coinbase and decided to move it to my personnel wallet.  That went well.  Then a few things happened at once.  Multibit informed me an update is available and I wanted to move my wallet from my c drive to an external hard-drive i can keep offline.  
Not knowing all the ins-and-outs of wallet programs(where things are saved and how updating the program works, I decided to just install a second multibit wallet program on my external.  Loaded it up and all was good till I went to close the program.  It hanged and wouldn't close.  Forced it to close with task manager, but then wouldn't load back up.  Rebooting would load up again but wouldn't shutdown properly.  
By this time I was frustrated.  Not knowing exactly how bitcoin works I thought as long as I had my address and personal key written down I could delete it all and start over.  Eventually I found out why the program was acting weird.  Was my Anti-virus software blocking it.  If I thought to check that first would have never deleted my files to start over.
I was so happy of that bitcoin too.  Got it at 503 just after the last crash when it went to 455 something.

:) Thanks for all the advice.  My wallet had only 1 bitcoin so its not a huge loss.
This journey is turning into a big task.  I do not know anything about linux, hexdecimals, ect.  Each time i use Linux and follow advice I get lost.  Its surprisingly hard to recover data from a drive when the file in question isn't a common one as in the '.wallet' is.  Most of the programs just detect the usual files people have.
Every webpage ive read on how to recover a deleted .wallet file takes alot of know-how using a few programs.
Stellar Phoenix windows data recovery does have a 'add file header' feature.  The window wants to know Software name, File extension, max file size, then Header Information(maximum 5 bytes) -Header(in hexadecimal) and -At Offset(in decimal)
How does one get this header info to a .wallet file?  Or does anyone already know it?
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:21:14
been reading on the pywallet and PhotoRec.  I've visited a lot of sites that explain things ( , and  , but they all assume you know a ton about Linux, or is a programmer already.  I'm just a standard windows user.

thanks Over the next few days i'll work slowly with your guide.  Give me a few days :)
Its a big 1TB drive :(
