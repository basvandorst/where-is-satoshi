There is no liquid water on the moon, so I guess it's wrong.

That's exactly why I made the post, I don't want just a  fit of the curve, that has not enough meaning
Edit: or, more precisely, I don't want just the number

Yeah, I used shapeshift as an example because for small values they do it without a confirmation, thus bypassing the waiting. I will take a look on this lightning network!

I think if enough people treat this like it is going to happen then it will happen in this case. The price is like a collective decision, not a phenomenon of nature independent of people's will.

Sometimes I think in that direction too, that maybe banks will store crypto as they store paper, only loosing part of their ability to produce money, but I don't know the tech well enough to have any confidence in my guess.

That certainly will help me, and the rest of your videos too. Thank you for making those!

Because they don't get anything. If you can't see the reason why anything is the way it is, then there is no way to see how something can be improved or why an alternative is better.

This is so perfect, I just started to learn python/internet/database things this month to understand bitcoin. This is exactly something that I want.

I think it's both education and personality. Academics usually become academics because they are intellectually inclined people. I am an academic myself and most people I know that own bitcoin are (take this observation with caution because, being one, the percentage of academic people around me is higher than average). Yesterday it happened that a colleague came to me asking about bitcoin and I only had to explain him one time for him to get what is all about.

There are 24 possible words for the first position. After you chose the first, there 23 left for the second position making 24\*23 possibilities for the first and second positions. Them you can chose among 22 words for the third position making 24\*23\*22 possibilities and so on until you have 24\*23\*22...\*1 = 24! permutations.
