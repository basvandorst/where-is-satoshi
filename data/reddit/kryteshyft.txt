These articles are all about traditional banks advising central banks, not about what the Central banks have been saying. 
Bank of England, Bangaladesh's Central Bank, Russia's Central Bank, the ECB, and the St. Louis, Boston, and Chicago branches of the Federal have all indicated some sort of opinion towards bitcoin. 
But these articles are just about what the private banking sector recommended. The text OP's post is from the Cato.org link she or he posted.
I think the Banks' motiviation here is obvious: Make everyone pay the same compliance costs as them, and they can continue to dominate the market. In all fairness, it would seem unfair to say "people dealing in Yuan don't have to meet regulatory requirements that everyone else does," just because it's a different currency. Obviously the Yuan bankers would have an unfair advantage. Bitcoin itself would benefit greatly from a lot of the services provided by the financial services industry, and it seems weird that the government would treat it different than other currency.
The caveats woud be that Bitcoin is much more secure than other currencies (re: the double spending problem) and traceable because of the block chain, and that might justify relaxing anti-money laundering rules for example.
This cuts the other way, however, as--depending on the Bitcoin financial service provider's business model--a simple hack into a customer's "online banking" portal or scan of their "cash" (paper wallet) and an irreversible theft is easy. Obviously the service providers and indivudals have an incentive to prevent this, and Coinbase and Circle don't even give you your private keys so they can use traditional online security mechanisms to prevent this, but those could be reasons why more regulation is favored on bitcoin.
I say get rid of the regulations on the banks, and /then/ see who wins, or who goes belly up and frees a lot of smart people to go back to school and do something useful.

I'm not endorsing the regulation. But it seems naive and mean-spirited to pretend someone who said "we don't want everyone starting a Bitcoin business" to mean "we only want well financed businesses in this ecosystem."
The critique of the regulation that this will hurt competition, rob the ecosystem of potential businesses and business models and idea growth since it requires a significant up-front cost to be compliant, and that compliance doesn't ensure any product quality or honesty of the company is very valid.
I don't think it's helpful to the debate or to Bitcoin to demonize people and organizations for remarks taken out of context and in their worst possible light.
Discussion of the real economic and consumer protection concerns is much more likely to create arguments that may sway regulators, the public, and politicians.

There is no science out that which will show that women are in any way "naturally" worse at math, science or coding. All of that happens after they are socialized into a system that expects them to be "less logical" and "more emotional," and that interprets their actions that way.
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:07:22
It sounds to me like Bitcoin is winning too. The FTC is treating this like any other consumer protection case, which means they treat Bitcoin seriously. Additionally, while the press of people being ripped off in bitcoin-related transactions is bad, the press that the FTC is policing the marketplace and protecting consumers in the Bitcoin ecosystem is probably good for confidence in Bitcoin.
The appearance of good regulation is probably great for the currency.

Bitcoin is very well suited for loans. 
The problem with your hypothetical is that if someone buys all of the bitcoins, the currency is completely destroyed. This is unlikely to happen, since acquiring all bitcoin would destroy the value of your investment.
Loans in bitcoin would be like a normal loan: I give you 100btc now, and you pay me 100btc in 10 years. In the meantime, you pay me 8btc per year. We write the contract, and every year you either pay me the 8btc, or I can sue you to collect the debt. You could also have some sort of security, such as an escrow account, a mortgage, or a car that I am entitled to repossess if you default.
You could also have provisions allowing the debt to be paid in a different currency based on conversion to BTC at the date.
Legally and practically, there is no difference between a BTC loan and a normal loan, except for how early the BTC sector is in developing.
(The scenario you posited is just like if a new currency was created that only one person owned, or if the government took all the fiat dollars it printed and didn't let people have them anymore. If people aren't able to use a currency, it loses all of its value.)
EDIT: clarified my parenthetical at the end.

Bitcoin hedging isn't some how special, its just *new* to bitcoin. It adds something to the bitcoin marketplace that wasn't there at all previously, and the addition of futures contracts should be a tremendous help in stabilizing the price of Bitcoin.
Since people know what sorts of prices people are expecting to pay 2-4 months out, people will have a better baseline of what the values should be now. It deepens the market in a new way that just additional user adoption can't.

I think the short answer is that Bitcoin will be deflationary, not inflationary if it's the only currency being used in a growing economy, but that just changes interest rates, it doesn't mean loans aren't possible.
Bitcoin can never be the only thing used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value. We'll still have houses, chairs, computers, bananas, and all of those other actual things. Businesses, loans, stocks, bonds, etc. 
If someone made a loan in bitcoin in a bitcoin-as-only-currency economy they're going to ask for an amount back later that's equivalent to their next best option. So if they would have bought an apple tree that earns them 1 apple a year with slightly more risk than the borrows risk of paying them back, they might ask the borrower for 1 apple a year as interest. 
I'm using apples to illustrate the return in a tangible way that is not currency. In this example, assume the apple will have the same value compared to other resources in the future.
They denominate the loan in bitcoin, because no one wants to be paid back in apples. Now, we get to the interest rate, which is NOT arbitrary. If all of the bitcoin has been mined, and the world economy is productive, bitcoin will probably be DEFLATIONARY. Since you only have 21 mil. BTC chasing a growing amount of goods, it will probably take less BTC to buy a fixed amount of goods each year.
For this example lets say that the price of 1 Apple in:
Year 1 = 100mbtc
Year 2 = 90mbtc
Year 3 = 80mbtc
Year 4 = 70mbtc
year 5 = 60mbtc
Likewise, let's say that the value of 1 Apple tree was 10 BTC in year 1 and will be 6 BTC in year 5 because of deflation. 
The lender, who is making the loan instead of buying an apple tree, will need only to pay back the value of the 5 apples (100+90+80+70+60=400 mbtc) and the value of the apple tree (which is now 6btc) in order to be equally happy with the apple tree or the loan.* So he will give the borrower 10btc in year 1, and receive 6.4 btc back in year 5 and be *equally well off*. 
Where does the rest of the bitcoin go? The short answer is that it is chasing around more goods. Its being used by the people the borrower spent the money on to buy things, and since there are more things that they are able to afford, they need to divide up their BTC into smaller pieces to buy those tings.
*For simplicity, we're pretending he won't reinvest the apples from the tree. This assumption doesn't change the analysis.

Bitcoin's value is primarily as a transaction medium. The technology that allows it to be so successful in that regard is available for use completely independent of the actual currency. If Bitcoin isn't adopted widely as a transaction medium, its value won't be realized. In that case the value of an individual bitcoin, won't really increase.
In your edit, "blockchain" may be more the more apt analogy to "internet" than Bitcoin is.
The US government, for example, could issue digital crypto-currency redeemable for dollars, or gold. If Bitcoin /itself/ is not widely used for transactions, it seems likely that the very efficient technology it is based on will be co-opted by existing institutions, and the currency will fade to memory.
It sounds like Thiel is saying that (regardless of the technology) he wouldn't put his money on bitcoin the product until it's used widely as a currency.
Look at the transactions over time compared to the price over time. Except for having major events around the same dates, they are fairly divorced.

**TL;DR: Digital currencies are a huge innovation for those reasons. But there's no reason those 'other merits' *have* to be tied to specifically Bitcoin.**
**Basic points:**
Bitcoin *itself* as a specific digital currency and a specific application of that technology only has great value in-so-far as the mining and transaction networks are large and robust. Right now, it's the biggest and most robust, but its still tiny compared to the financial services field as a whole. The VC invested into it is only about $100 mil., and it would only cost about $200 mil. to buy the computing power to launch a successful 51% attack. For comparison, Chase Bank earned $6 Bil, or $6,000 Mil. in the past 3 months.
Other payment systems could co-opt the technology. BTC's ecosystem and user base have to be extensive enough that this is prevented in order to declare it a true winner.  The potential for different products that use the same technologies to capture the value of the technology without using BTC is very real.
For example, Apple could make Apple Coin, roll it out beautifully, use very similar technology, and have it partially backed by Apple until it takes off. They could invest in it a lot such that the mining network is developed, Apple Coin becomes adopted widely as a currency, and the public has confidence in it aside from Apple's original backing. They could stop backing it at that point, and it could become as decentralized as BTC. With Apple Coin's huge market share and well developed ecosystem, BTC would fall to the wayside.
Another example would be if several huge players got behind LTC or Dogecoin. BTC could plummet even while the technology behind it is widely adopted.
**Where I'm coming from:**
I don't want other players to co-opt this field! I want it to be like the internet: made by nerds who value democracy and autonomy, and allowed to grow free long enough that governments and corporations can't restrict its freedom of use without serious blowback.
I am pointing out how I come out on these issues because we can't take Bitcoin for granted; if we want to see Bitcoin succeed, we have to use it as much as possible. If you're buying something from Amazon, buy it with a giftcard purchased in bitcoins from eGifter or Gyft.
Send bitcoins to friends and family who are tech savvy as gifts, tip on other subreddits significant enough amounts of bitcoin that the user goes and collect it. As a community of early adopters who care about the product, it's up to /us/ to help it succeed. 
**We can't say its success is inevitable because its inherently technologically superior, or has such a huge head start that it will definitely be the one that wins. I think that's just not true.**

Well, oil isn't "pegged" to the dollar, oil sales are just denominated in dollar terms. So oil floats relative to the dollar, but you have to change your currency to dollars to buy it.

From what I understand about Reddit's announcement, they want to create a cryptocurrency backed by stock. So you could go to Reddit and exchange 100 RedditCoins for 1 share of Reddit stock.
This means that they need to have complete control over the amount of RedditCoins minted, because whenever they mint new RedditCoins, they're issueing a promise to issue stock, albeit a negotiable one. Can Reddit be certain that they are the only one able to create RedditCoins with the ColoredCoin infrastructure?

TL;DR - My theory is the price is currently driven mostly by speculation on future price increases which is consistent with the current price level, since it is low, but substantial, relative to Bitcoin's potential. I think it should be about 5x higher if it is being used in place of a significant portion of the existing payment processing system.
The data suggests that a fairly small number of people suspect Bitcoin will be widely adopted. Ie, that current prices are driven by speculation, not adoption. Bitcoin has the potential to capture a significant portion of the global financial payments system. If it captured 10% of that roughly $350 bil. industry it could be worth 5x what it is today. Bitcoin will probably also increase the total value of the industry since it is a significant technological improvement, and replace payment processing processes that are too small to be traded on major markets. It also is likely to capture (or be adopted by) a portion of the banking industry, and other financial services industry. 
But right now, the transaction volume and price are consistent with "Bitcoin is like beanie babies--people buy them because they think they will soon be valuable."  The potential is there for Bitcoin to be widely used enough of a currency that it's closer to a shiny metal than a beanie baby, but the tipping point for a lot of investors, economists and business people will be when people are using it to buy and sell on a daily basis, not as a novelty or as a place to park money that they think will appreciate.

Bitcoin is not an answer to poor bank regulation. 
It does help individuals fulfill a lot of the functions of a bank without using the traditional banking system, and therefore can replace part of that ecosystem.
We can be our own vaults with which to store value, we can verify our own transactions, we can have our own digital transaction medium. All of these functions compete with banks at a very low cost.
Obviously other functions of banks such as consumer lending, earning interest on savings deposits and CDs, etc. can't be replaced by Bitcoin. They could all be denominated in btc, but if you have an institution that takes deposits and makes loans out of those deposits, thereby fulfilling those functions--you have a bank and you need good regulation.*
Or at least not /bad/ regulation.

Completely true. 
Inflation just usually refers to the change in the amount of goods &amp; services something buys, not the raw change in money supply. For example "adjusting for inflation" doesn't adjust for increase/decrease in money supply, it adjusts for the change in prices of a fixed basket of goods over time.
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:02:30
You need a large number of unrelated people to verify transactions to make the innovation behind bitcoin work. A monolithic entity can't be trusted to verify its own transactions. Additionally, you need to be able to exchange the digital currency for goods, services, or other currency for it to have any meaning.
Chase can tell BofA that it sent them 20 bil. "Chase Bux" but unless BofA can do something with those "Chase Bux," they're useless.
Banks may very well use the technology between themselves, creating "banking dollars" or something, but they would be at risk of collapsing if non-banks never used them.
Technologically, if they were worried about "banking dollar" collapse, they would have to figure out a way to move fiat or physical currency into or out of the "banking dollar" system. And that would require either: a) a centralized authority willing to exchange "banking dollars" for something else, or b) a large number of persons who are willing to accept "banking dollars" as payment.
Basically, there will probably be only a few dominant digital currencies, or digital-fiat-backed currencies, or both. Small players could try to launch their own, but unless they're adopted widely (or by a HUGE player), they will remain worthless.
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:51:08
This used to be how American currency was minted, and I don't think it went as poorly as you may think. A "Chase Bux" becomes just a small, easily transferable corporate bond backed by Chase Bank and tied to the dollar. People have their choices of currencies in that situation and will pay different premiums based on how secure they think the investment is.
The government crowded them out, however, so it could be in charge.  I think that might be a more robust monetary system because of the greater diversity and competition. But what do I know? (Nothing).

To the extent that gendered marketing perpetuates oppressive notions of difference between the sexes, it is probably sexist in a way. But to the extent that it empowers women to explore areas of life which they may not otherwise feel welcome in, it is probably uplifting. 
I think that as awful as gendered marketing is in forming harmful gender norms and then taking advantage of women and girls, if the site is even slightly successful in encouraging women and girls to learn and succeed in an incredibly important field that is so disproportionately male-dominated, its probably doing more good than harm.

Bitcoin is like cash in that if it's spent, it's gone for good. If someone gets access to your private key, they can take it, and you can't do anything (except maybe try to sue them). This is different from a check, or credit card transaction, or even a bit-coin denominated Coinbase transaction where you have an intermediary who may try to protect you if you get your identity stolen.
If you don't want to go through the rigamarole of using a series of one-time use paper wallets created from virgin devices on the bottom of the ocean with a series of EMPs detonated around the computer before and after and then burying them in the Svalbard Seed Vault, just treat your wallet like a wallet. The security level is roughly similar. Sometimes you may lose it, or get mugged. A few hundred dollars is the most you should put in it at a time probably, maybe a little more for an hour while you make a big purchase.
If you want Bitcoin as a sizeable investment, THEN you should be more serious about security and be very careful that you aren't compromised.
A lot of people buy bitcoin because they're worried about global banking system and fiat currency crisis, so there's a DIY ultra-high security culture around bitcoin.
