I wouldn't say easily. That's a huge exagération. Takes way more than 300, and it's not easy

Unfortunately I couldn't sell even if I wanted to because the transaction has not gone through with the bank yet. Maybe that's a good thing, we'll see.

Good points, especially that last one. A 1-3% deflation would be great. Not too big, but a win for normal people.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:11:07
Haha yeah I hope you're right!

$3140 right now! I just got into cryptos and bought a little at $2700. Was not expecting this kind of growth

It's very early. It's completely different in Asia
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:14:23
That's true. It will be interesting to see what happens. Bitcoin has the potential to completely shake up finance and economics as we know it
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:57:26
Excellent point
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:16:07
Interesting take. Right now it's definitely just an asset, but it is used a fair bit in Asia, especially Japan, Korea, and I think China. We'll see what happens, I could see it going either way

Unfortunately I purchased bitcoin for the first time after the fork, so no bitcoin cash for me :(

Someone watches crypto daily 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:02:50
Wait. There WILL be a dip
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:29:36
How is that relevant to what he said? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:56:20
There will be a dip, likely below 8k. Give it a few days, or maybe a wee or two. Be patient.

Binfinex is from Hong Kong, which is an autonomous territory of China

Vertcoin is just getting started 
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:57:17
I like Peter Schiff and agree with him on a lot of stuff, but boy is he wrong about crypto 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:36:09
That's big
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:50:18
Golds a great idea, but a scam. Check out vertcoin. Gold is a vertcoin copy

Let's wait until safely above 4k for this meme

I simply said I don't like them. They don't need to be banned, the market has spoken and btc forks are not successful. They will stop eventually. They never would have that demand if it weren't for the name. The only thing forks have going for them is the word bitcoin. If they were a new currency, they'd be worthless. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:58:36
What a silly question, you don't need a fork for competition. Just make a new coin, stop trying to steal the bitcoin name. Forks create a new billion dollar currency out of thin air simply because they include the word bitcoin

Straight savage 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:54:46
I looked about an hour ago and it was $6700 then all of a sudden I get a price alert for 7k! Exciting times ahead! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:10:14
I hate forks
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:31:51
This whole thread is filled with people saying "who would actually spend btc here" "the fees" "the confirmation times". Do any of you actually think btc will be used a currency, because it really doesn't seem like it

That was *sniff*... beautiful
