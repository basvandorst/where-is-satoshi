This makes very to little sense.  
1. 13 million ppl is fuck all
2. The INR 500s and 1000s are being replaced with 2000s.
3. Cash is a primary form of payment in the economy, bitcoin is not a substitute, nor a stable store of value.   They'll just buy gold or deposit the notes that they can, take a loss on what they can't, and start over with the 2000s

Bill Gross just likes it when you here his voice.   That's why he mentions hot button topics. ..ie bitcoin.  He will not invest.

Done a lot of research as of late and this is almost 100% fake.  There are only a hand-full of individuals in the world with the tech and knowledge to do this...the price is too low and sounds too good to be true.
