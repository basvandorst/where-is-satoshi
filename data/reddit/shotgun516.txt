Depends if he really needed the money. Sometimes you gotta pay off debts and what not

One day BTC is gonna blow the hell up and the average person is gonna regret thinking it was nothing to think about. People investing in this digital coin is prob only 1% of the population maybe less

Compared to you guys in this sub, I feel like a bum for only owning .01 Bitcoins lol but I guess you Have To start somewhere! I only put a small amount from each paycheck to what I can afford but it’s a long term investment for me so adding my position slowly is better than nothing I guess lol I want to get in before the next bitcoin boom

Well I’ve done a lot of due diligence but r/weedstocks is a good place to go to learn about all different companies. But I’ve invested some good US cannabis companies...obviously its a long term hold since it’s not even federally legal but I feel like within 5 years (10 years absolutely max) they will legalize it. So I believe in this a lot and I want to be a part of the journey. Also once it’s federally legal in the US, huge corporations like Coca Cola and Marlboro will want to buy out these companies

I’m doing that with investing in BTC and cannabis stocks. Those are super long terms HODLs

Can you buy BTC with a credit card on Coinbase?

I’m planning to buy a little bit each week for years and just keep accumulating and hold for 5-10 years
