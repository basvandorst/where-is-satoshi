What is so amazing is that Bitcoin is still very very niche... The adoption is around .1% right now. We have so much more room for growth, it's insane. Bitcoin/cryptos WILL be accepted nearly everywhere by 2025, that is my prediction at least...

how can bitcoin be truly decentralized when governments can control it like this? they may not be able to control the blockchain, but they can control it's legality, purchase, market, exchanges... which is essentially controlling bitcoin. 
so everyone that says the governments have no power with bitcoin is bullshitting themselves and everyone else. its just like anything else in society that gives people power. those in power will usurp that role and undermine it the best they can unfortunately. i hope i am wrong, but I don't really see how. The US government could step in and heavily regulate it as well similar to China.

which is a form of control... i still don't get it. Governments still have control. Just like media has control over peoples opinions.
