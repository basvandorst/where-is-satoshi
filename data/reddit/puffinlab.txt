I would argue that anything that functions well as money is of immediate practical utility and therefore has value.
edit: if, in addition, it also allows you to write to the immutable distributed global ledger, then it's immediate practical utility is even greater.

According to Wiki P. expenditures on energy were about 10% of global GDP in 2011 (~$6tln). So $65bln is only about 1% of global energy consumption to run the global financial system on bitcoin. That seems reasonable to me.. but obviously I'm biased.

Why the fuck can't I buy my ticket with bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:19:51


One major reason is that my deposits are government guaranteed. If the bank went down and the guarantee was not honoured, it would mean there were much larger problems in the financial system. This is the reason I hodl bitcoin in the first place, there is no counterparty risk if you hold the keys.

That's not really how market cap works though is it.
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:52:19
Price is determined at the margin by the traded amount of bitcoin, not the total amount. If you put in a market order right now for $10M worth of bitcoin, the price per coin would probably rise to a few thousand dollars, and Bitcoin's market cap would increase by tens of billions.

I already downvoted the OP because these posts don't add anything useful (yes yes we get it.. it's amazing you figured out how to divide numbers).
However the OP is saying something different than you are. They are speculating about the future wealth inequality that would occur if bitcoins become worth much more, thereby transferring wealth to bitcoin holders.
Your comment is in the present tense:


How bitcoins are currently distributed has barely any effect on global wealth inequality. For example the recent Chinese stock market crash wiped out ~$3T (a huge wealth transfer), whereas the bitcoin market cap has only gone from $0 to ~$4B in the last 6 years.

Maybe you can make the argument that the traders are insane, but many trading platforms offer 10-30x leverage for bitcoin trades with no proof of reserves, and loads of people use them. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:29:50
That's like saying the wealth inequality with helicopters is worse than with fiat, because most people don't/won't own a helicopter. 
Wealth inequality exists independently of the currency that the wealth is measured in.

If the value represented by those coins went to zero, then even if you owned a million coins it would not equate to any wealth. 
What you're talking about is the current inequality in the distribution of bitcoins -- which is not the same as wealth inequality.

Like the conclusions..


the central bank – to ensure that the monetary system is not undermined.
Undermining the current monetary system is the whole point. 


and is potentially very useful for future competition in the financial system.
Seems like you would need to prove this is possible first, because it sounds like bullshit.


reporting and income statements for all networks and other appropriate regulations would be
"balance sheet
reporting and income statements for all networks"... what does this even mean?


Sure, because gold has intrinsic value x_x.
