I think it unlikely you will get anywhere near their office.  Good luck and let us know how you go.

The Australian Reserve Bank still has some ammunition.  Reserve Bank Rates are at 2.5 percent (translating to residential mortgages at around 5.5% give or take).  And most Australians choose fully variable rates too so they are immediately impacted by rates changes.

What's 28,000 missing bitcoins between friends?

Anyone can join the Bitcoin foundation.  I suggest you join and take up the issue if you feel strongly about it.

I suspect this will fall into the category of "nice try".  
The fact that the IRS and FINCEN have pronounced that bitcoin is not funds is not binding on the judge (who will make up his or her own mind).  
@_date: 2014-01-19 08:16:02
I would examine the rare incidents when difficulty fell on bitcoin.

So what happens if Wells Fargo offers to keep your bitcoins in their vault and pay you interest on them?
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:18:10
Fascinating.  I assume you can hold the price while the transfer confirms?  Do they use multisig for this?

Where is the proof of burn?  All I see is an address.   Where is the proof that no one holds the key.

So I went in and checked it out. It is hidden away down an arcade on Adelaide Street and to be honest unlikely I would have noticed just walking past. But glad I did because the coffee is really good (and no I am not just saying that because it's bitcoin...). It is a darkish roast but has a really smooth finish.  I must find out what beans they use.  The breakfast wrap was advertised as the best wrap in Brisbane and I have to say it was pretty fine. 
Sam (a girl) behind the counter is lovely and says she has been using btc for a month now and has a couple of regulars who use it everyday.  I might become one myself.

Ghash probably just pointed their pool at some other SHA coin for 48 hours until the fuss went away.

It costs me about $1.50 USD per month in Visa fees for my USD 14.99 subscription to WOW (forex charge). Over the past 5 years that's 90 USD that I didn't need to waste on Visa. 
Bring it on.

Last year Australia had the world's highest per capita disposable income (beating Switzerland) so the population is used to buying the latest gadgets. (Yes I just called Bitcoin a gadget...)

"Call Bitcoin".  That's fucking awesome. 
Guys please be patient with Tiger Direct.  If we are too hard on their staff, they will drop it as a payment option.  I know it's difficult but let's try to be polite.

I use Windex all the time.  Don't understand the fuss.

Peak stuck transmissions from Gox: 70,000 BTC 
 
Go to Mt Gox stuck transmission outputs, select all and look at 7 February. 
That's where the coins went.  TX malleability.  You only needs to lose 70,000 coins ten times to lose everything.

What about addresses with a deposit but no spend transaction?  Are they represented?

The negative comments need to be understood in the historical context. 
 Australia has a number of government funded mass transit pay card schemes that have ended in disaster.  The Myki card in Melbourne took 8 years to implement and cost $1.5 billion.  
I have no idea how they cocked it up so badly but Australian taxpayers are very wary of another disaster.  The government is not trusted to implement IT.

Just make sure the new coins go to a new address and spend from that address.  That way you can prove the coins came in and the coins went out the same day.

Further to comments below a hardware wallet in the shape and size of a credit card that uses Bluetooth or NFC for POS transfers.  Same functionality as Visa pay wave. No dicking around with mobile phones or passwords.  Limit it to low value transactions (up to $100 USD per day) and rely on the user maintaining physical security of the device.  
Swipe to pay. 
No need for screen the POS terminal can display withdrawal amount.  User can check balance online via app plugged in to blockchain.

Bitcoin is a Western plot to steal the hard earned savings of the Chinese people so it is better to stop it altogether to preserve social harmony.

Click on "all time".  I cannot directly link to that.  It shows peak at 70k
The point is that if you average 35k every day for weeks - that's it.

Zerohedge is not a reliable source.   Of anything.

We aren't talking about chance. We are talking about many people with access to vast pools of processing power.  All things are brute forceable given enough processing power (including SHA 256 except we are thousands of orders of magnitude short of being able to do so). 
All you have to do is throw enough hashing power at a vanity gen to create a long vanity address. You need to show why the length of the vanity address is computationally infeasible especially as the end looks like a standard address.  Why not use a 100% vanity address?

Awesome will check it out.  Very happy to have somewhere to buy food in the CBD. 
The Roastery cafe in West End also takes bitcoin (and has a bitcoin ATM).  The coffee is brilliant and go check out the carp living in tanks under the seats in the back courtyard (no joke).

I have heard that the owner is the son of an important leader.  Do you think that makes a difference?

I had a look at the collection of brands behind that company and was embarrassed for them.  The "Yo" debit card.  Proxima RF. Really?  Make up your minds what you are doing.

Thanks great chart.  There are more bitcoins in recent circulation than I expected.  
A suggestion for a third dimension would be to show where the rich list wallets sit in this distribution.

Once the funds have left China they won't come back.  Many wealthy Chinese just want out.  Others want a bolt hole in case it all goes bad.  Traditionally the funds have ended up in Western real estate and purchasing Western businesses.  Whether Bitcoin itself becomes a store of value remains to be seen.  
I agree that 31 January is the shut off date for withdrawals even if I am relying on google translate.  The most recent announcement 8 hours ago is consistent with this.  
Stormy times ahead.  What will happen between now and 31 January I have NFI.
