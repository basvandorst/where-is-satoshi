I was in a Vegas strip club and there was a ATM like Bitcoin machine inside. I asked the guy who was seating us if anyone uses it and he said that just about all the strippers will put money in at the end of the night. Not a bad idea with unrealized gains.....

As others have said, I would go and buy a cheap laptop and format it. Then make sure you disconnect it from the internet. Can never be to cautious, especially if you don't know exactly how many are on the stick. I use a ledger nano s for my storage and it has been amazing! Highly suggest something like that.

Right?! Like nothing at all. I couldn't believe it, all while the crypto market is skyrocketing.

If you look at season 2, episode 11. There is a scene where the e-coin guys are arguing about getting ahead of the Bitcoin phenomenon. And they are talking about how it's going to kill banking and change everything we know. I couldn't stop smiling, this show is amazing. [Here is the clip!](

Don't forget that litecoin has EXTREMELY cheap transfer fees and is EXTREMELY fast. They also have 4x the amount of available coins.

As a security professional I completely see the benefits of a hardware wallet like this. It doesn't get any more secure. The reason being that you never physically type a password or key into your computer. That thwarts a good Chunk of hackers and vulnerabilities right there. Secondly the device automatically makes it a 2 factor. Something you have(nano), something you know(pincode). Granted you will always have your seed being exposed as a risk. That is unavoidable.

So you are saying to wipe the device until I want to move crypto around? And then recover from seed and do what you need to do and then wipe again?

Am I the only one that can't stop looking at the woman on the right in the background?
