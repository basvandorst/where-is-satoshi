It's tens of thousands of lines of JavaScript. It's anything but.

That doesn't protect you from as much as you think. 


Could have been designed to do it in a weak way. How do you, as a lay end user know that? You don't. You take the advice that brain wallets will be stolen from, and that the website you used is malicious. 


Who says the code you got from brainwallet.org is the same as on github?
Who says anybody has ever audited it? 


They'll be happy until they are whisked away.

No, times. To verify a proof of work header you do twice as many sha256 hashes as there are blocks. After some consistency checks with the format, timestamp, all you have to do is hash twice and compare the result with 0x0.

Fun fact. Did you know brainwallet.org was made by "joric" when he wasn't making enough money cracking brainwallets? He came on IRC bitching that he was too poor, and then started asking questions about how to speed up his "pubkey generator".

I get the impression that he is a charismatic speaker with little to no practical experience with Bitcoin. Unfortunately that doesn't bode well for the technical clarity of his talks either, from some snippets I've watched he makes the same sorts of mistakes in them as in this book (confusing merkle trees as being used in the unspent transactions output database, for example).

The "random" button was deliberately left weak for months and then a whole lot of Bitcoin was stolen from users of the website. There's no way of knowing if the site doesn't serve up backdoored code sometimes. I doubt anybody has ever audited it really. You'd be a fool to trust the concept or that website in particular.

Do you live in a bubble? 


From listening to his speeches and reading this book he could have fooled me.

4-6 times faster, which is still not notable as far as mining goes. You're never going to be matching a mining ASIC or anything. 
These opcodes will be able to be used to speed up verification of blocks on very new CPUs, but hashing is such a insignificant part of the process (ecdsa verification is the real killer) that it's not even worth mentioning. Verifying the proof of work of the chain takes 330000*2 SHA256 operations currently, which is under a second on almost any consumer X86 processor. There's many more in verifying the blocks and transactions, but even then you're looking at maybe tens of seconds of total computation.

Expecting editors to work for free in order for the author to make more profit is a pretty tall order. We're not talking about one small misunderstanding, the entire book needs scrapping and rewriting to make it even moderately coherent. 


That's what the book claims to help you to do. Master Bitcoin.

I'm not going to work for free for somebody who is being paid to publish a book. If you go along with that belief everywhere, come work on my farm to make sure I don't sell bad carrots. It's for every bodies benefit so you will naturally do it without pay.

Brain wallets are jaw droppingly moronic. A cash farm for people like joric (the creator of brainwallet.org) who can basically live off the waves of people who think they can be smarter than a farm of GPUs cracking them. Why the hell do you think you can give advice about this?
@_date: 2014-12-26 02:14:12


That would be stupid. With 3 of 4 pairs I could brute force the missing one.

It's absolutely packed with mistakes and misunderstanding. There's a terrible chapter with an example which will cause you to destroy all of your money if you follow it. It's quite obviously written by somebody who has had no practical experience with using Bitcoin at the level the book is claiming to teach you about. It's very poorly written, has little to no applicable value, and doesn't teach any of the best practices it should be teaching to people who want to become involved with Bitcoin development. You'll find that the actual core developers of Bitcoin will tell you not to touch the thing with a ten foot pole. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:32:44
It's a hard question to answer, lots of people want to get different things out of Bitcoin. Do you want to work with it, interface with it, assist in core development? There's a wealth of information on the [developer guide]( it's a little raw but the authors do take constructive critique well and are constantly improving the information available.

OP_MUL (the multiply operator) isn't a valid opcode and hasn't been for 4 years. If you use this in a P2SH script your money is unspendable forever. If you use it in a pay to script output your transaction will be invalid. If you modify the example a bit and use it in a pay to script output, your money will be instantly stolen because the text doesn't explain that you must have a signature verification opcode in your script. 
This is super important stuff that needs to be taught to anybody who wants to be writing Bitcoin script, and it's completely missing. It's not an isolated case either, the whole book is like this. 


That was clearly a mistake or some inexplicable lapse of judgement on his part.

We must have read different books.

It upsets me a lot actually, I feel that it's a massive missed opportunity that will drive people away from wanting to learn about Bitcoin. 
The book dives into random little macro bits of the technology for no reason, misses big picture concepts, and wastes a whole chapter on pumping worthless altcoins. The "description" of how ECDSA works is just a bit of algebra diarrhea that doesn't even explain the core concepts, nobody can get any value out of that whatsoever. Large portions of it (take for example, all the random tables of binary formats, of use to nobody) are ripped from the Bitcoin Wiki with little regard to context or actual value to the reader. 
Lots of people have bought this expecting that they'll learn everything about Bitcoin and it's technology, but it's just a confusing mess. It could have been done much better with a competent writer at the helm, as it is, it reads like a high school student who has left all their homework all until the last minute, only in book format.

Not everybody is American. 


I've never heard of him outside of this subreddit, so you can hardly be speaking for me.
