I am over 50 with savings and business interests. The service banks afford to me are unrivalled.
In fact,  your comment is the exact opposite of the real world. It's easy to want to "be your own bank" when you are a teenager living with mom &amp; pop and you have $500 to your name and think you are on some crusade against the big evil corporations. Hence the current BTC community being largely under the age of 25.
Try being your own bank when you actual wealth to store and money coming in/out from various businesses.
If you want security you pay a bank to look after your money; it's protected from robbery, fraud, hacking, bankruptcy and it's super convenient in the western world where most business is done and where most people travel.
BTC will *never* afford the same level of security which is why it will never compete. Keeping BTC on your own hardware wallet is the modern equivalent to stuffing notes in a suitcase under your bed. Sure it hides your money from governments but 99.9% of the western world doesn't have a need to do that and they also want their money to be stored more securely.  
The same thing with BTC - it certainly provides a benefit to some, but it's still the same people who previously stored money under their bed, so 0.01% - hence why it hasn't and won't go mainstream.

Well you say you don't use banks because of 1 scam but then admit bitcoin is also full of scams. So back to where the benefit lies?

Saw you say that at 16k, 15k, 14k, 13k, 12k, 11k, 10k, 9k, 8k, 6k...eventually keep calling the bottom and you'll be right. ROLF

Yeah, keep your BTC on a glorified USB stick hidden from Governments but easily open to theft from literally anyone else.
Unless you are dealing in some seriously shady activities your odds of being robbed or mugged are far greater than the government freezing your assets.

Why do you want to be your own bank?
Are you in the third world?
In the western world banks are secure and protect you again theft, crime, or even banks going bust you're bailed out by government.
Being your own bank to me is no better than stuffing cash in the mattress. It's open to so many risks with literally zero benefit?

And there are no scams in crypto? Lol.

So BTC is scam proof you say?

A business should and can choose to do business with whomever they wish. IF JPM don't want your money there are plenty of other banks that will.
A business storing it's money on a hardware wallet is risky as fuck. That's never going to be a selling point.

Yup - I spend fiat and btc; btc is painful - having to wait 4 hours for a transaction to go through before I can use the service i'm paying for. With creditcard it's instant.

Of course they make money from us, they provide a service that thus far is completely unrivalled in security for large sums of money; it's is only fair they are financially compensated for it.
