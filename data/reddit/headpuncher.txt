When you had to say something important or deep or profound, explaining in 128 chars or less was a challenge. Now people can just ramble on. They took all the fun out of it.

Funny to see this posted, as I read the white paper this morning and am in the process of reading the Eth WP this evening.   
The BTC WP actually cleared up so many questions I had (another 100% n00b here). I can see from reading it why the bakers are afraid and spreading FUD about crypto-currencies.

I think that with a car analogy, why aren't Tesla writing about the fact that a Tesla could be hacked? Satoshi was 'selling' bitcoin. We can only speculate as to Satoshi's ideals, maybe he wanted a systen that would usurp the traditional banking system (I mean 2006 when he started work on it, banks were already being vilified for their behavior and so on). The white paper is short, it does not cover everything or claim to attempt to do so.   
I mean, *everything* can be hacked but the btc system itself isn't being hacked (afaik) maybe compromised security is a better phrase as the means of stealing btc usually center around stealing keys, so why mention that the users need to breath air?

Bakers, lol. I mean, they might also be afraid, but I don't know what of.

It's not even a challenge any more.

Most UK banks guarantee up tp 2 million GBP, more if you 'buy' a particular type of account. For 25m USD I would start shopping around the world for residency so I could bank there with a guarantee that met my needs. 6 months in a foreign country could make millions of differences!

That's a frightening way of putting it. Slaves to the wage.

[There is ONE NAME at the top](   
Although the conclusion does start with "We have proposed...".   
Assuming it is a 'royal we' the paper is by one person, the person named at the top, on page one.

I have 480 Nvidia GPUs and according to my unpaid bills I have mined a fuck-load of electricity by mistake while searching for bitcoin. I never even knew I was rich! Where is the electricity exchange?!?!?!

The whitepaper was signed by one person: Satoshi Nakamoto.
We don't even know if that is an alias. Given that it is a Japanese surname it could be a real person living abroad (because Japan denies there being a person on the current census with that name).  
What is funny is that if you google "nakamoto" you get a lot of English language sites claiming it has BC related meanings like "rising from the ashes of centralization", and while names in Japan can generally be divided into words with meanings, it is also a name that goes back at least 300 years [wiki stub]( and might just be a guy's name. The speculation is interesting, but nothing compared to the ridiculous fan-boi-ism of OP's post.

Maybe Satoshi doesn't move the original blocks because he bought into bitcoins mined by others early on, trades some, kept some, gave some away in exchange for pizza and generally helped bc gain traction.   
It doesn't have to be that either he exited early or that he has fiat elsewhere. This isn't modern politics of "choose one or the other".

Technically they're not a budget airline, but a low cost airline. Ie,  they don't try to milk you and they provide a reasonable service.

Is Bitcoin/crypto not the most socialist currency ever to have existed in the known universe?
It literally allows a person to participate in the most level playing field imaginable, and anonymously too, without class, wealth and status being a part of their 'profile'.
But also, claiming a state failed because of its socialist policy, when linking that failure to the price of oil on international markets is what? An oxymoron? Contradiction? Plain silly and ignorant? Idk, but I do know it makes no sense.
Anyway, good luck with the communist currency. Viva krypto. komrades!

It's Barclays, they are uncaring shits, much like RBS (rob from the poor, give to the rich), HSBC (kings of money laundering) and all the others.

Actually UK banks do have IBAN, they just don't use it for anything that isn't international transfers. I used to have a UK account and a UK off-shore account (before they outlawed off-shore for anyone except the super-rich) and I had to sue IBAN to transfer between the two.

The real question is why you have more than 2 cards. You have a bank card linked to your current account and ...? What? Maybe a credit card or maybe another debit card with another bank? 
Why are you collecting trash and making your life complicated?

I like the bit where they get caught, fined and then told to carry on as usual.  
It surprised me enormously to see it was HSBC who were stealing donations from pro-democracy protestors. /s

We used to have a points scheme with a card for the supermarket, but then they just merged them, so the bank card is linked to the rewards card scheme and the rewards scheme doesn't need to make and send out cards, the customer doesn't need to carry a card, the cashier doesn't need to ask, and the points get auto added. 
Then, when you have points and want to spend them, you go the website ans transfer the cash equivalent to the bank card, next time you are in the shop the cash value is automatically spent. That is proper use of technology to simplify the process.

The Norwegian central bank just raised rates again, to nearing 4% iirc. Scandinavia is pretty close-nit so this doesn't sound right to me (but i'm too lazy to fact check it).

That's how I pay my bills!  
I want to reimburse you for this nice car, but neither the car nor the money you want me to pay with really exist. \*drives off at breakneck speed\*
