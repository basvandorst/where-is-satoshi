I understand your point. But American Express doesn't need to create a new tech. In fact, it is pretty simple to integrate BitPay for example to receive Bitcoin. American Express should care less about being innovative whatsoever, they are well established and well known in the market and you can use the card almost everywhere. 
I imagine most people asking where to buy Bitcoin with Amex, would be interested in using Bitcoin to pay their balance back on Amex as well. 
Amex cares about profit and wants customers to pay their balances on time. So receiving Bitcoin will be win-win for everybody don't you think?

Do you think that they will ever consider entering the market? In my opinion, the majority of crypto card providers will disappear if Amex starts accepting bitcoin.

You made your point clear. Merchants should accept Bitcoin without the middleman, and I think that would be great. But you are still missing my point here. Merchants pay their expenses and taxes using fiat, so they are interested in fiat not in Bitcoin. Having said that Amex, Visa, MasterCard they have a massive infrastructure that enables everyone to use their money everywhere. Taking Amex integrating BitPay to receive Bitcoin as an example, I think users that have Amex cards will be really excited to have that option as cashing out Bitcoin is associated with an expense, many crypto card providers have implemented Bitcoin in prepaid cards to make that possible.
To put that into context, Amex as a card provider is a merchant and that goes well with your point.
It would be beneficial for all parties involved if they start accepting Bitcoin whether that by implementing their own payment gateway or by integrating BitPay because it allows Amex to r convert Bitcoin to fiat almost instantly. Nevertheless, from business perspective, Amex is now facing competition with newly established card providers such as Revolut, Monaco, Wirex and many others just because they have this payment option. Why would Amex risk its clients to leave with such a basic added-value that could be offered at their convenience? Amex can win big in this particular market with it's global client-base and infrastructure. Unless you want all merchants to accept Bitcoin except Amex?

I am giving BitPay as an example as a payment solution according to their website  But I believe there are many other providers that offer similar services to enable merchants accepting Bitcoin. 
Since there is an increasing number of merchants integrating BitPay to enable customers paying with Bitcoin, I don't see why not we see it on Amex as well.

I think we can see $10,000 by the beginning of 2018.

Is there any incentive for the US government to take this approach anytime soon? Just curious.
