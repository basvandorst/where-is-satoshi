Bitcoin related. Doesn't matter if its mining, not mining, if you are a bitcoin business, they shut down your payment gateway through them. They started out by saying it was "one aspect" of Bitcoin, which was funny, as we didn't even do what they were saying as a company. We explained this to them, they understood it, and then came back with the excuse they don't work with any businesses who deal with "bitcoin."

Humble Bundle does not sell anything specific to BTC. They don't write any BTC software, they don't do consulting, they are simply a merchant who takes BTC -- not a BTC company.

They indeed offer 1-3 week shipping, and it is real.
We own two Skyhook's and both were delivered in less than a week. We purchased them about a month apart as well, so they are doing this type of shipping on a consistent basis.
Kudos to Skyhook in an ecosystem that generally does not deliver anything on time (for various reasons...)

They certainly dont, Stripe is actually ANTI-BITCOIN. We've been fighting with them for weeks over this.

So, even in the picture of him using the Lamassu, I'm pretty sure the Skyhook right next to it was fully functional. A lot of it had to do with the network connectivity in general, it just seemed that the Skyhook would time out more often than the Lamassu, and the Skyhook once timed out, does not always come back without a refresh. Since I've operated two side by side and played with them on my own for some time now, you can expect a detailed review of the pros and cons of both.
And yes, if you reboot the Skyhook, it comes back up into an admin area.
They are supposedly working on open sourcing the Lamassu, but they have not fully done that yet.
Source: I'm the one helping Patrick Byrne in the picture use the ATM that Lamassu posted.
I personally think the kiosks are cool, but long term viability seems questionable with a lot of non bank ATM networks already looking to retrofit some of their current infrastructure to support BTC.

Because Stripe bans any Bitcoin company that uses their payment gateway, citing risks from their "brick and mortar" bank institutions.

I do realize this, but Bank of America and SVB will do what they wont (process CC TX for a bitcoin company, knowingly and happily): that tells you just how hard they're working on convincing their partners of the uses of Bitcoin, or looking for new partners that share their views on Bitcoin.

I mean that if you were to do any sort of business in bitcoin, or offer bitcoin related services (anything from consulting to exchanges/mining to non profit's), Stripe will turn your account off.

Just checked the picture again, and the Skyhook certainly was functional when Patrick used the Lamassu -- you'll most certainly be able to tell in the video as well.

I wouldn't laud a bunch of praise on Stripe. They ban, shut down, and put restrictions on all Bitcoin companies using their service, citing "risk." It's sad that their CTO and the company do not share the same values, and there seems to be a major disconnect there.

While I do love the Skyhook ATMs, my main complaint about them (and customers of ours who have used them) is that the camera used on the Nexus 7 to pick up the QR code can sometimes be a bit clunky to scan certain QR codes.
We own both Skyhooks and a Lamassu, and overall I like the Skyhook's better, but the scanning of QR codes, especially if the lighting isn't perfect, can be somewhat frustrating.
Has there been any updates on these to address the issue? The last time I had one running in a public area was back in June.
Keep up the good work guys! I think you have a winner on your hands if you can figure out the clunky camera issue on the N7.

I don't even need to google, I'm one of the companies they refused to work with after taking over $10,000 in payments through them. They put restrictions on the account and then refused to process any more.
