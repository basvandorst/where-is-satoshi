I'm not sure what your college degree should convince me of. Anyway, let's put aside the fact that crime doesn't pay in the end and let's assume its not a ponzi scheme. After he has enough capital he would simply stop offering that type of return. He stated that he pays out in a x amount of days and that's the only agreement. Once he has adequate capital this deal will simply disappear and he will drop rates to reflect market rates. 
It still probably is a ponzi scheme.

How is it impossible? You could give a dealer $5000 on the street and he can easily make a couple thousand from it while he gives you only $350 interest. I'm sure you are aware of the type of markets there are for bitcoin. From the little read I did it also said you have to manually reinvest your interest earned as well.

Oh please, stop mixing theory with practice. Stop using high school math and get some real world experience and then report back.

Yeah, it's mostly people saying the same thing over and over.

If he's in the blackmarket then 7% is no problem at all.

Not sure what a "normal" store is but plenty of stuff has big markup. Only expensive and popular items have low markup. Laptop computers, game consoles, etc. 10 to 30% or so.
Things like cell phone cases that sell for $3 to $10 cost 20 cents to $1. The only thing is that it's harder to sell those.
When you consider illegal things like marijuana you should be able to easily make 3x as much with more sales than product. I don't know the exact figures of black market but things like cocaine and heroin must have great profit margins.
I'm not saying this isn't a ponzi scheme because that is the easiest way to do this. Why work at all when you can just screw with peoples mind as these guys don't have to reveal where the money is going. I don't recommend investing mostly because the money is going to be dirty one way or another.

A cell phone silicone case that sells for $3 to $10 costs between 15 to 50 cents. A $20 to 30 laptop charger is about $3 to $8. This stuff has a lot of competition so its harder to sell as an individual so your volume won't be that much. Now I don't know exact prices on black market stuff but something common like marijuana can easily be sold for at least 3x as much with more sales than you can ever have product.
Now I'm not saying this bank isn't a ponzi scheme but 7% weekly interest is not hard when you don't know where the money is going.

This is a temporary situation and pretty much any market would be dealing with this issue when flooded like this.

My point was that sales tax is a big clue that it's in the US.

Yeah, I don't like people supporting this because it makes bitcoin seem like a novelty thing. Internet Money Coins, GEEK GIFT IDEA
