Why don't you simply buy some? 
You can try faucets, but it will be very very little amounts doing no brainer taks for several weeks.
You can also try Amazon mechanical turds, if you live in the US.
Why do you want btc so much? Don't expect anything from it, apart from an intellectual boost, as it takes lots of reading and understanding if you want to know how it works.

Big and heavy. Like Bitcoin.

So you should have said “one day, in the near future , you will be able to trade them for anything you like “
Right now, bitcoins are used to store values, not anything else.  Until an other crypto with better features will replace it, or until it evolves to become better. Today, its usage is more restrictive than last year.

The blockchain is as revolutionary as the invention of the wheel, or printing. 
Bitcoin is only one of its applications.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:26:14
Higher fees made them stop. Today’s it is not worth buying pizzas or coffees with bitcoins, as it was advertised a few years ago. There are now transactions types for which bitcoins is not adapted anymore. 
Its price is fluctuating too much, fueled by greed.

Which shop accepted bitcoins payment to buy your PC monitor? Cos I’m also looking for one...

If you never sell or use bitcoins, then it has no value.

Exactly, so OP statement about never selling bitcoins shall be edited. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:59:03
Not much to trade it for in Europe. Even Steam stopped accepting bitcoins. Can you give precise examples (links as proof). Last time I used bitcoins to buy something, it never got delivered and the scammer disappeared.

Funny joke, reminds me the Internet explorer joke.
Bitcoin is faster than you think. I usually received the first confirmation within seconds. Of course, I wait longer when I am the receiver.

It is a very good news for France! 
There will be a gathering of Bitcoiners (developers, university researcher, users,etc) in Lyon on thursday 15th of may. It is a first time.

English is not my primary language. Evangelist is maybe a common term in the tech industry in the US, but this is like giving the stick to be beaten with:

Any chance to have this working on a mobile browser to be able to use it on a iphone ?  
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:13:57
Will it be available in Europe too ?

Tricky way to establish the Y scale.... And to make people believe that its fiat rate is constantly increasing. Its price could drop, it would not matter to those getting BTC and using them immediately, it would only be a bad news for those hoping to sell them back for fiat when its price goes up. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:00:48
How much was the transaction fee ?
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:24:46
Everytime I bought BTC, price went down shortly after, even before I had the time to use them. Therefore spending them would make no sens. 
Now, I am not willing to invest more because 
1) if I do, price will go down again for sure. i'm cursed I believe ;-) 
and 2) because I have reached my investing limit for this year. And investing more would be silly. 
I am pretty sure 90% of holders are in this stupid situation.

I believe Swapbill is doing exactly the same: it is also in testing phase.

Mining is a waste of time. Especially if you're broke. 
Buy a few milibits or any other alt coins, you can play the trader for a while. Or save them for later, or use them. Do your homework before putting money on the line. Learning how cryptocurrencies work is already very self rewarding. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:38:15
What design? You only wrote a few words. Not everybody knows reddit. Sorry but I  expected more. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:56:15
I am still pretty new into BTC, I've learned a lot about it this last month, but I am still looking for a good tuto to learn to read the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:51:32
Bitcoin is more than what you said, because what you descriebed is fiat money (closed system, no product, no dividends). I had stocks too, they lost 75% of their values too. Bitcoin has so many other features (fast payment, low transaction fees, global currency, money storage which are not pushed forward enough). 
This year is not a good year for bitcoins, in term of stability. But the system is deploying fast worlwide.

Where is this street where all the shops accept BTC ?
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:41:27
Bought BTCa few weeks ago, then its price dropped, now want to spend my BTC, but I can't because it would be buying something at a higher cost than it is in fiat. :(

Declining the Bitcoin in a fantastic world would work better than religion. 
"One Coin to rule them all, One Coin to find them,
One Coin to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of the Blockchain where the Bitcoin lie."

And you are waiting for Satoshi to come back on Earth ? ;)
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:37:24
Thank you for this clarification. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:47:18
I thought you could not receive any bitcoin or pay with it ? (because of Apple's rules)
@_date: 2016-11-19 08:02:26
Do you think the bitcoin price index is currently increasing because of the fiat crisis in India ?

34 millions devices in theory. So that would maybe still a good thing if 100.000 of this device would run  worldwide, even pointed to the same pool, or private pools.
When will it be available in Europe?
Is it possible to had extra miners on them locally?
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:52:40
If he wins, you are going to have some work to do...
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:40:27
No worry, there will be an other big dip.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:45:17
Let's say, everybody on reddit sells bitcoins at once, price crash, we got plenty fiat, and all spend a very nice xmas, then we all buy on the 1st of january again, price goes up again, we still got wallet full of bitcoins next year.  Good idea ? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:52:16
Most likely not. Those who thinks bitcoins grow on trees and that you can get rich starting from nothing are not living in this world. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:05:50
There were talks that hosting a bitcoin node could earn you milibits... but i think they gave up on this idea...
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:56:05
To get rich buying and selling BTC...This is a myth.
Unless you already have hundreds of thousands of dollars/euro etc to invest in, then if you are lucky you can get a few extra by playing with BTC fluctuation. This is a full time job of "selling high, buying low", and again, I am not sure you could make a living of it. 
But then, if you excell at this game, then you are probably wasting your time with it, and you should be trading other values.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:15:38
Big fees for sure. Must be the worst way to get bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:35:22
Not sure it can give you cash back. I believe no. It only transform your  money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:04:59
Well , that is not exactly right. If it was that easy...
@_date: 2016-07-03 08:25:24
Now is a good time to use btc bought in the last years.
Steam Sales are on. Bought two games recently. It is Super Sales for me.
