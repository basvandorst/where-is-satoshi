The aesthetic of the slick looking USB and simplistic GUI being accessible when it's plugged in was a big selling point. 
Plus, the added security of both the false wallet, the pin code, and the actual metal casing is worth the price, especially when I'm putting large amounts on it. Don't trust a mobile app to safeguard my coins.
But honestly, let's be real here, I'm far more likely to lose a piece of paper than a USB. I lose everything aha.

Make an account on QuadrigaCX. Easiest place to buy **and sell** your Bitcoin. You need to verify your account using both a piece of valid photo ID and a bank statement or bill to prove address. However, you can fund your account using a voucher code without being verified. Vouchers are created by other members withdrawing some of their funds and putting them on a voucher. Like a gift card.
If you decide to make a QuadrigaCX account, pm me your member ID and I'll send you the code to a $10 voucher.

Doing awesome! Just bought myself a hardware wallet after debating it for a week. The best part? I paid with BTC directly. Felt euphoric spending it. Also, making heavy profits with LTC. How are you?

For what it's worth, it may be a small transaction, but I used BTC to buy a Ledger from  Went through BTCPay and it worked first try like a charm.

Been in since October, just used some of my profits to buy a Ledger Nano S. Felt fitting to buy a device to secure my Bitcoin with Bitcoin itself. Enjoy the Switch!
