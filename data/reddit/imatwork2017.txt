There are three lightning network implementations as of now (lnd, eclair and c-lightning). Only lnd requires the btcd backend, the other two work with bitcoin core

There is no atomicity, it is broken down to one step per channel. Check out [this]( presentation for details on how it works.

The default fee in testnet is 1 satoshi right now (each node is free to set their own ofc) and you can use up to millisatoshis (1/1000th of a satoshi) so it is much less than a few cents.

Can someone tell me how to run a litecoin lightning network node?

I run a LN node on a raspberry pi (on testnet) so hardware is not an issue. You need to have a hefty amount of funds in your channel to be really useful. Here is an example how it works.
I open a channel with amazon and I fund it with 5 btc so in my channel the balance is { Amazon: 0 me: 5}
Bob and I have an open channel with 5 btc each. Bob wants to buy something from amazon but doesnt want to open a channel with them so he can use my channel for a fee that I set (let's say 0.01 btc).
Bob sents me 1.01 btc so our channel balance becomes {Bob 3.99, me 1.01} and I send Amazon 1 btc so our balance becomes { Amazon: 1 me: 4 }. 
Bob payed me 0.01 btc and used some of my balance on my other channel. If my Amazon channel balance goes to 0 I will have to top up again (and pay miner fees)
So you need to have a lot of coins in your channel to make this worthwhile or create channels that you expect to have traffic both ways.

This should be pretty easy to do in Python but there are 120 billion 12 word combinations from a 50 word pool. And each combination has 480 million possible word orders so you can't do that.

Download and install Python 3.6+, clone the project, enter the project directory in your hard drive, shift right-click in the file explorer window, select open powershell window here, type `python`, then in the interpreter type:
    from btctools.HD import check
    check('my super awesome mnemonic here')
you will get True if it is valid or False if invalid

And what did you contribute to it so it can come out faster?

It took me less than 12 hours to download and verify the whole thing. I moved the chainstate folder to an SSD usb stick (3 GB should be more than enough). [Here]( is a tutorial on how to do it. The bottleneck was the bandwidth (50Mbit connection) instead of the I/O.

Also check this out  it's similar to your's, everything implemented in pure python

Correct me if I am wrong but if the court somehow recognizes that he is satoshi, wouldn't he have to pay like a gazillion in taxes?

What does that even mean?
