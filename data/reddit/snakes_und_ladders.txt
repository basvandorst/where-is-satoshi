At this point it's best to think of it like you are converting into the Euro or another currency. 
It's essentially a speculative, publicly owned currency. If you think it's going to go up and you want to invest then buy some. If you think the volatility is predictable enough for you to get lucky and trade you can take that risk. 
It's a sort of Pascalian wager -  the downside is you could lose that money - but the upside, in a best case scenario, is you increase your worth by over a thousand fold.

No love. Asking people to install random bitcoin apps is like a sketchy guy on the corner asking to 'just hold your wallet for a second'.

Crazy predictions? How about...
TOR gets forked to TBOR(The Bitcoin Onion Router) that requires a bitcoin stipend to connect to the network every 12 hours in order to price out orginizations who run thousands of nodes with the purpose of de-anonymizing TOR. The connection stipends are treated similarly to bitcoin mining and are distributed in smallish chunks randomly to people supporting the network. 
Scientology embraces bitcoin and uses addresses and blockchain messages to track the progress and generosity of acolytes. Colored coins will be used to prove followers OT level and will be also be used to provide access to resource materials that lower level OT's are restricted from. 
or 
Someone opens an elite email service for wealthy people that rejects all incoming messages unless they have 0.1 attached to it. Anyone who emails them will have to literally pay them to get to their message into their inbox. 
People working in sweatshops start sending 'help me' messages smuggled into the products they make with public wallet QR's attached - as this catches on lower management starts slipping faux messages into the products to draw additional profits for themselves from generous do-gooders.

It's still pretty universal that banning of technology or knowledge is not acceptable. Remember when they tried to make Sony's AACS encryption key illegal to post online? People went crazy posting it everywhere.

*  1) With your mycelum wallet open, go to the 'my money' tab in changetip.
*  2) Scroll down to withdraw and click the withdraw button
* 3) In the wallet address field, type in your public address exactly as it appears, (it should start with a '1') then enter the amount to withdraw and hit enter.

I like bitcoin a lot, but this is still very funny.

If you want some bitcoin you will most likely have to buy it. 
You won't be able to mine at a profit - it's too specialized/expensive to get into as an individual.
'Cloudmining' contracts are a scam run by shady individuals so beware.
Computers running mining software are the engine that processes any transaction sent within the Bitcoin network. 
Anytime you send bitcoin, a miner authenticates your transaction. 
Miners then get rewarded for their work in bitcoin for running the network.

A paper wallet is the best for storage - if you buy through coinbase their app is safe enough (IF you 2 factor auth your email and coinbase account) for small daily amounts.

I second python. It was my first language, and while I ended up moving to something else afterwards, I think the simplicity of the language allowed me to grok the basics of programming better than if I started with a more verbose language. 
I am also a fan of Go code which is the simplest language I have toyed with. Though, I think it is lacking a diverse modual library and API support.

At that point they would be saying 'yes we are a corrupt puppet state' - and as f'd up as the US modern bureaucracy is, I think it's filled with people deluded enough to believe that they are ultimately working on the side of good.

Don't do it like this. People will see this as you nickel and dime-ing them not just showing your accurate cost.
Add the +3.95% into the price of everything on your site. When the payment comes up make them:
* Bitcoin: (3.95% Discount on all purchases - Best Value)
* paypal: (free)
* WU: (extra charges may apply)

Hey! Regan was a piece of shit sockpuppet who had big businesses dick jammed so far up his ass it replaced his tongue. 
The fairytale of the free market was sold to the American conservative working class who thought the invisible hand would finally create a magical environment where hard work would allow you to become rich because taxes.

Yeah, lately I've been thinking about the infrastructure that enables control of systems by the ultra wealthy - my fuzzy conclusions probably belong in lol  
But I thought this was the most interesting thing in here this week:
It's kind of long but the TL;DW: is that the lack of privacy in voting at the senatorial level means wealthy organizations have a record of votes and it facilitates a culture where paying for votes is quantifiable by those with the money.

Isn't this a massive conflict of interest? Like, if Kodak decided to lobby against digital cameras because they could be used to facilitate child pornography? It's not even hidden cleverly - it's straight up "This will take business away from us because terrorism".

I already have one. 
What I'm saying is that you can only buy the hardware wallet to protect your bitcoin, with bitcoin - and if you are new and want your newly purchased bitcoins sent to a safe hardware wallet to begin with you won't be able to.
I'm not criticizing, it just seems like a roundabout way to get the technology into peoples hands.
*edit - what's with all the hostile comments lately in general? I feel like this entire sub is pedantic and shitty to everyone.
