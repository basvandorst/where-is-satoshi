Don't buy reddit gold pls

I'm pretty new to Bitcoin transactions and yesterday I made 8.

That Cuda was sold by Barret in a much better economy. Nobody is gonna see prices like this for years.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:01:27
Bank transactions are insured. I'm not going to even respond about someone stealing your gold from a bank. The point is there should be a way to cancel a transaction that was made in error or by a security breach.

Is 147bs commonly seen on the black market, has the rate dipped any further yet? 
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:46:24
Wasn't sure if it was possible, but your suggestion and analogy is worse than mine. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:47:16
Weeeeeeee! 
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:51:36
I absolutely agree, but I think once law makers get the wrong idea and tackle cryptocurrency. It'll be akin to detaching a dog from its favorite bone.
@_date: 2014-12-09 00:37:54
We're clearly talking about electronic transactions. Thanks though.

In about a year or two I'll be able to buy the whole neighborhood. For the price I paid for my home. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:11:51
Wow. Really that high already. Just about to make a trip there and I'm negotiating a rate with a friend. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 07:45:31
This is amazing. I'd love to place a couple orders but what is the legality of some of the parody cards someone wishes to create. Trademark infringement?  And are you entitled to include parody watermarks? 
Is your service available internationally, how about Canadians?

If you can't beat them, join them. How else do you undo the lies, anti Bitcoin lobbyists are spewing.

This feels like an viral marketing for Brazzers and I knowthatgirl.com
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:45:29
Intriguing. In other words dont spend the bits and keep them in cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:25:20
Heck yes. Sounds like a generous offer. :) 
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:35:12
What's the best way for me to get started, buying some Bitcoin, keeping it secure and acquiring more as time rolls on?
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:56:48
Feels like the NSA and a collective of government agencies across the world are waiting for another Mt.GOX they can raid. If that money was so easily taken then I don't feel safe about my all my money being stored in one exchange. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:25:21
Yeah the amount of misplaced or misappropriated coins lately is very troubling and alarming. I thought crypto-currency was supposed to be 100% safe. What makes things worse is the owner of the coins is held responsible.
If coins can't be recovered from attacks then there is a fatal flaw in the way the network operates. Why aren't there fail safes in place.

A lot cheaper and better coverage if you cut out the middle man and just get a sponsorship on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast. 
Another thing to think about is how Adam Corolla (Podcasters in general) are in the midst of a major lawsuit by a patent troll who owns the right to serial playlists.

It applies for the situation. Its not a literal statement drawn on blueprints that always works. Ask a person a question and they reply with "depends.. " of course it depends on the situation.

This is lame.

Wow thanks! 
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:17:29
Sorry, should have specified. Canada. Plus in order to get friends and family involved can someone recommend simple videos or articles explaining how Bitcoin prices mature. I'd also like to take action supporting the cause by running a node.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:57:44
Why not have something like a 12hour window where a transaction can be revoked by the sender. I guess the system wasn't built to work like that. If there's an inherent way to exploit the system then it's always going to happen and I don't see how people are supposed to just accept that.

Fuck apples. I love Bitcoin but I also want to use cash for things.

What about recurring buy fee's. Why isn't it better to buy once per month, rather than once a day? 
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:21:23
 Those that bring nothing to the table, shouldn't complain how it tastes. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 04:07:03
I love how those are so easily threatened by losing potential monetary gain, would engage in activities completely fucking others over, just to keep holding on. Its archaic.
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:33:20
EBay just wants to find additional ways to rip people off with their PayPal conversation/convenience fees. These guys at PayPal are the same breed as Ticketmaster.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:56:31
Don't trust eBay!
They know how strong their hold is on the emoney front lines, they're robbing people blind and the people have had enough!
They're taking a strategic role with a comment like this. Trust no one.
I don't know how many of you are aware of the eBay global shipping program. Its a system where the users must opt out of, by default. They send their item to a shipping hub that acts as a middle man. The middle man (Global shipping) automatically collects an importation fee, up to 34% (typically 25-30) of the items cost, then ships it to your country in Canada or EU. This is for every item, even used ones! I don't mind paying my fair share, but there's no guarantee that Global is paying the full amount they collect and I find the amount to be egregious.
The department is also a bunch of bumbling morons, who unwrap carefully packaged items and wraps them back up damaging stuff in the process because its not their property. Some that have extreme collectors value. I actually didn't receive an item one time and according to their department it was delivered to the wrong town, but because it fell within 30km of my home its considered a delivery. 
Sorry for the rants people. Im on mobile and I had to share a few things off the top of my head. This is the kind if thing more people have to know about. Its not just a few isolated incidents either. By all means Google eBay global shipping and read posts and forums. It's a real problem, that they won't take responsibility for.

Have some family who travel to Venezuela often. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:03:44
That's all very well and good. However I was thinking about the annual fees incurred from buying all those coins.
@_date: 2015-03-11 10:34:42
How is that feasible? 
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:07:57
That's still expensive for small startups.. $500 a year to buy Bitcoin for an employee earning $50k.
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:11:30
Couple days. Monday or Tuesday. I also have friends and family in Venezuela and it's getting very difficult to send money there, especially large sums. This is a topic that I really want to learn more about so I can implement it in the future.
