People exposed to the announcement will know your shop is accepting bitcoin.

I think the only real danger would be if the thieves somehow put all their gains together and amassed a large enough slice of the 21m bitcoins to enable them to manipulate the market at a future date. Theoretically even this would not be fatal as long as full fungibility was established between legit btc owners' bitcoins and the re-booted Bitcoin 2.0 that would follow...

I think there's a Cyanide &amp; Happiness in-the-writing there - have an upvote!

Fantastic suggestion. Just LOOK at the intelligence bristling in that young man's face! If this is what he's achieved with nothing imagine what he might achieve on just a few tips!! ... But how would he spend them in a place where only the super elite have access to technology? .... Maybe if we sent him a few old smartphones and tablets he could knock up his own Darkphone Satellite Phone and then tell the rest of us how to do it?!! 
Love this kid and wish all power to him!

A lovely, impassioned plea. Upvoted. 
However... I doubt that those carrying out the various 'shenanigans' are stupid, far from it. Therefore I doubt that many of them consider themselves to be 'shitting where they eat'; instead they are more likely taking actions consistent with private agendas. 
The admittedly very painful teething troubles being encountered within the bitcoin ecosystem are entirely to be expected. The bitcoin protocol impacts a whole host of other ecosystems wherever it touches them - it's paradigm-busting nature causes friction and that friction is undesirable to a range of existing interests.
As long as the ongoing development of the Core of the Protocol is not itself 'subverted' somehow, the current frenzy of attacks and losses will produce the necessary conditions for the rapid development of the security of the system (full end-to-end encryption through a fully decentralized exchange would be nice! lol) It's kinda like a very painful, extreme, hostile beta-testing environment and so ultimately positive...potentially... 
Whatever the case, it's all pretty exciting stuff! :-) 
{edit: obviously there are some idiots who do shit where they eat with impunity! lol }
