Well if it goes to zero, yes pulling out prior would have been a good thing, but you can never know the future.

Well if you think that’s bad, there are 3 billion people in the world living on $2 a day, another 2 billion that earn less than the average wage  of Mexico at $4.71 a day, a total of 5 billion in poverty, be thankful you have food stamps or social security.

Elliot wave 3rd larger correction.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:13:45
That’s questionable as well, Amazon May have a very large turn over but its profit margins are small and it’s never paid a dividend, sure People that sell inside amazon make money, and they have a very large internet platform as a complete solution for businesses.. but I worry when companies get this big on low margins that don’t pay dividends.. we will see, time will provide us with truth.

Disagree, BCH split was well after the collapse of BTC..
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:21:34

Agree one thing that’s certain about life is uncertainty.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:22:14
It’s still apart of a pool however.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:39:35
Yes but you can only claim 3 k tax losses.. so a lot of extra money lost unfort.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:19:43
Yep probably save some money by not trading anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:18:58
Yes, remain anonymous when it comes to crypto, there was one guy who told everyone he made 500k then he got beaten up and everything stolen, then he committed suicide, so yeh keep it to yourself always.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:12:46
Accumulation, = averaging down, can be a dangerous scenario.
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:53:36
There is no such thing as a death spiral, get over it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:39:56
Lol.. yeh trolls.. by the way I don’t hold bitcoin myself just hope everyone else can do well this xmas..
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:00:59

Intra day spike
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:32:23
Agree amazon have the right formula for world dominance, they want to head into groceries and just about everything you can imagine.. it’s a monopoly for sure, but they have the right ethics as a business, Again time will tell, just hope they arnt too top heavy for everyone’s sake.
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:25:38
Ridiculous question, only bitcoins price moves alts period.
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:20:17
If you get hacked a hacker can literally take over your computer and “own it”, they can go through your files and see what you see basically, sux badly.
@_date: 2018-12-09 05:06:56
Yeh it’s an awful thing have a friend that lost 500k easy to do in cryptos.
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:51:27

Yes AWS, has a high turnover but like all of amazon it’s profit margins are small...As a complete business their turnover was 50 billion and they made around 1.5 billlion profit.
They lost 600 million in Europe last year... massive turnover low profits
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:00:26
It takes around 12 months for resistance levels to soften.. so wait till then.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:00:08
I doubt that very much.. you don’t need linear graphs for Elliot wave predictions.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:41:01
Well thanks for your explanation but my own technical and fundamental analysis told me BTC was going to do that anyway.. people spend a life time to find reasons why things happen, even the stock market was falling around the same time.. many other external influences not just BCH.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:12:14
My partner said this when LTC was $260 now it’s $50 lol
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:29:42
So I gather you like talking to yourself?
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:08:12
Well dun, I think its a gud idee to hodl wen u can.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:25:44
Well they can now take bitcoin as well.. the Govt is pretty smart these days.
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:55:18
I have to agree, if you look at the price of amazon and others we are in a slump, and it will get worse, I can’t say that cyber currency will be a “safe haven”, because it’s still linked to fiat and its inflationary measures. Your right in down times many do turn to gold because it’s time honoured, but maybe not so much this time round. We will see but yes it will be bigger than 2008.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:31:38
I agree it’s not really a death spiral everyone is talking about.. but I’m not sure of a large bounce either.
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:39:20
Ahh do t need to go fast, I’m a cruiser to be honest.
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:00:03
And it’s going to be super super super cheap!

Dead cats bounce are not a nice thing to endure.

@_date: 2018-12-07 11:43:31
It depends on what you call 70% of the time and within what price range, 
Again charts are vague,they don’t include external factors of the day.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:23:20
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:00:49
I bought in at 6k now it’s going down the toilet unfortunately, bad decision on my part sadly.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:25:41
This is very true... good luck everyone hope you find the bottom somewhere
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:17:16
It is all the way to 100k!
@_date: 2018-12-08 05:08:16
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:24:20
Yes, but considering all other external factors at present you won’t find the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:03:06
Ahh come on, we don’t want toy lambos, we want real lambos!
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:29:06
$10 and for me it’s no stress
