They are probably right

It's the standard for tipping. The standard for everything else is still BTC, with distant second being mBTC.

If someone has 100x more wealth today and still has 100x more wealth in a decade that inequality hasn't worsened.
The problem that we currently have with inequality, and what Piketty argues, is that concentrated wealth leads to worsening inequality.

Oh, so you don't know the difference between metric and decimal?
If Bitcoin is metric, to which of the 7 base units does it map?

That doesn't change the distribution of wealth at all. If they have 100x your wealth and you both double your wealth, they'll still have 100x.

So you don't believe in economic growth, or improvements in productivity?

Do you really think he stole them? I consider him more like a retarded bank manager who doesn't hire a security guard and doesn't know how to lock the vault properly.

All news sources are "just some guys blog", implying they all have the same quality, reliability, and trustiness.
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:52:03
All news sources are equal, so my blog is as valuable as the front page of the Times or CNN?
Much better to have some justifiable process of evaluating sources than to simply go on gut feel.

It's really not. Use Coinbase or Circle. Trying to secure your own wallet is beyond most people.

You might want to check what the metric system is and isn't. Bitcoin does use SI prefixes, but it has nothing to do with the metric system at all.
It is much more like troy ounces, an arbitrary measurement used for gold.

Undergrads can be bright - maybe not great to work with, but definitely innovative and intelligent.
