This is completely false.  What the hell are you talking about?  ALS is a heterogenous disease caused by genetic mutations in several different genes that lead to motor neuron death and present with the same symptomology.  For the record, there is only 1 FDA approved drug, [Riluzole]( approved for ALS treatment.  So much for pharmaceutical companies making all that money.

I'm here because Bitcoin is a technology which offers many advantages over the current system, plain and simple.  It wouldn't make sense not to pursue and invest time and money into a system that can help save money for the average consumer, improve the remittance market, and has several other useful applications (smart contracts, micro payments, etc).  I don't identify as a libertarian or other; I'm just supporting something that makes sense to me.

The public address is a unique string of 27-34 alphanumeric characters that acts like an e-mail address such that the owner can be identified and transact through that address.  The creation of the public and private keys in the Bitcoin protocol utilizes asymmetric public key cryptography, developed in the 1970’s and expanded thereafter.  Specifically, Bitcoin uses the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) in generating the private key (a 256 bit number where this represents 256 characters with 2 digits per character) and public key pair.  Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 curve in identifying private keys, which offers valid private key spaces between 1 and 2^256.  To put this into perspective, there are an estimated 2^76 stars in the universe and a computer working at 10^13 operations per second would take roughly 10 trillion years to correctly guess the private key.  Similarly, the public key is also identified through the (x,y) co-ordinates on the same curve.  Once generated, the public key is run through a series of cryptographic hash functions (RIPEMD-160, SHA-256) to produce the associated public Bitcoin address.  During the RIPEMD-160 hashing, the 256 bit keyspace is compressed into 160 bits, which effectively means that while there are 2^256 private keys, there are only 2^160 addresses.  This means that for each bitcoin address, there are a possible 2^96 private keys that will unlock it (2^256 – 2^160).  While this may seem scary, 2^160 is still such a large number that any brute force computational attack is unrealistic.  (1,2,3,4,)  During the hashing functions of the public key to generate the public Bitcoin address, the first 4 bytes of the second SHA-256 hash are taken and added onto the RIPEMD-160 hash.  These 4 bytes are what is known as the “checksum,” which provides the mathematical link between the resulting address to the private key and is important in verifying the two are linked.  Lastly, the resulting string of digits is converted to the final Bitcoin address format using Base58Check encoding, which essentially allows the address to appear in an easier to use, alphanumeric format.

@_date: 2014-08-08 18:16:33
This is pretty much the answer, but as wrote, it's a chicken and egg problem.  I've written this before, but here's my take on this question that is constantly asked:
The bottom line is that yes, right now, the consumer eats the 1% fee to pay in BTC (by acquiring Bitcoin at a cost) and also forfeits any rewards he/she may get when purchasing with a credit card. Obviously everyone will say "but BTC saves the merchant 2-3% in credit card processing fees and this gets passed on to the consumer!!" But since we are still in the early days of BTC growth, no large scale merchant is going to start reducing their prices any time soon. BTC purchases make up way too little of their profits to do so. The point here is that anyone who owns Bitcoin now is an early adopter and that is a fact. But in order for Bitcoin to continue to grow and expand to the point where Bitcoin actually does cause the merchant to reduce their prices by 2-3%, more merchants need to accept Bitcoin and more people need to spend Bitcoin. More merchants will accept Bitcoin the more people spend Bitcoin, and more people will spend Bitcoin the more merchants accept Bitcoin. Thus, a nice symbiotic relationship between merchant and consumer develops. But how does this relationship form?
If you've ever read or watched Freakonomics, you would know that incentives can play a large role in driving human behavior. What's important to realize here is that both merchant and consumer have the incentive for Bitcoin to succeed and here's why: As stated before, we are all early adopters. Within the past 2 years, Bitcoin is up 11,689%. For many people, they have earned what is seemingly free money. This encourages many people to spend their earnings on things they otherwise might not buy (hey, I made some profit in Bitcoin, so why not buy those bed sheets my wife has been talking about, etc). Of course, not everyone is going to do this, and not everyone has made profit on Bitcoin, but this phenomena of spending your extra earnings is definitely real. But that's not the incentive; it's just a little bonus. The incentive to the consumer is gaining more money, which comes in 2 forms, of which both are a direct result of spending some Bitcoin. Incentive  is that as more people adopt Bitcoin, the more the price is driven up. Incentive  is that as more people adopt Bitcoin, the more money they can save by shopping at merchants which offer the 2-3% discounted prices. The merchant's incentive is that as more people spend Bitcoin, the more customers they get, and thus the more profit they earn.
As more people spend Bitcoin, this encourages more merchants to accept Bitcoin. Eventually (key word), there will come a tipping point where the amount of consumers that pay in Bitcoin is high enough that it incentivizes the merchant to apply the 2-3% reduced price for those paying in Bitcoin. In this scenario, I imagine the merchant will be taking a slight risk that encourages Bitcoin use over credit card use. In this short period, the burden of losing money on transactions (as consumers had been doing up until this point) is briefly passed on to the merchant as he/she takes the risk that lowering prices will win customers over competitors. This will in turn drive more consumers to use their store and drive the cycle further along where the majority of users now pay in Bitcoin (merchant incentive achieved). This now allows the merchant to reduce their prices over other competitors and also saves the consumer money. Of course, this will save the consumer money at other merchants as well as they are forced to reduce their prices and accept Bitcoin in order to keep up (incentive  achieved). In the mean time, if Bitcoin does grow to this point, the price will be significantly higher than it is today (incentive  achieved). This means that all of us early adopters can stop bitching about paying an extra 1% fee now because that amount will be so minuscule in the future if this experiment succeeds. Therefore, in order to encourage this adoption of Bitcoin by both merchant and consumer, we as early adopters must make a small sacrifice to spur the growth. But remember, we have the incentive to do so.
Of course, the long-term deflationary nature of Bitcoin does encourage hoarding and that is okay too. As long as everyone isn't hoarding then Bitcoin is still allowed to grow. But as growth occurs and hoarder's profits increase, even they will begin to spend some of their Bitcoin. Not everyone will, but the psychological effect of free money is a strong one that encourages spending.

* [Bitpay and Paypal are already partnered and are presumably preparing for integration over the last few months](
* Why are you pushing Bitcoin ATMs so hard but not merchant adoption? They go hand-in-hand.  People will not go to ATMs if they can't spend it anywhere.  Think of what you use an ATM for - getting quick cash for spending.  Coinbase, circle, and other places make it easy and cheaper to buy BTC just to buy BTC.  
* [You can spend BTC on gift cards for hundreds of places at Gyft](
* In order for rewards cards to be relevant, there needs to be more places that accept BTC.  Merchant adoption is integral to mainstream awareness (in America).  Unfortunately, it's likely that Bitcoin's features make over the counter retail-esque purchases not ideal and certainly not overwhelmingly better than cash and credit cards.  
What should (and is) the priority are the features of Bitcoin that make it significantly better than existing systems.  These include things like remittances, micro transactions, "be your own bank" for the unbanked, stock/bond/title ownership through smart contracts, smart property, etc.  These things take much longer to build out the necessary infrastructure for.  Hundreds of millions of dollars of VC money doesn't get spent all in a year, it takes a while to build quality products.  Time is your friend and BTC has made significant leaps in 2014 despite the price not reflecting this.  Merchant adoption is easy because of little to no risk for merchants due to Bitpay and Coinbase payment processors.  This has made it an easy target and certainly helps in creating legitimacy for BTC naysayers, but merchant adoption is certainly not Bitcoin's killer app.  
I would argue that it is relatively easy to buy Bitcoin in America, Europe, and maybe other places I'm not familiar with.  The problem is constructing applications and wallets that hide Bitcoin's "scary" components such as BTC addresses, the concept of keys, cryptography, security, etc.  For this point, the "we are in the 1995 internet phase" is entirely relevant.  E-mail was originally very hard to send and hard to understand - have you ever seen the video where the news anchors are discussing how to pronounce the @ symbol?  Bitcoin becomes adopted by the average user when the user is blind to the confusing aspects of Bitcoin.  This takes time.

And of course this has been discussed several times here that incentives to maintain the blockchain work because of Bitcoin as a currency, which Draper didn't say flat out but you can see he understands this.  Interesting to think what the interviews will be like next year.  Either way, it's very positive that a guy like him is so involved in building the necessary infrastructure out.

I'm a grad student in a lab that is heavily bioinformatics based, although I do not work in that particular space, so forgive my (somewhat) ignorant questions.  This sounds like a very cool/interesting idea.  Some questions:
1.  How limited are labs in their computing power to analyze these datasets?  I understand that the data generated from omics-based studies is quite large, but it seems like most labs are able to handle it with cloud/large server storage.  How much of an improvement will a peer-2-peer system really be over what is currently done?  I don't actually know this but maybe you could expand further.  
2.  For things like next-gen sequencing, how automated are the bioconductor/R programs for sequence/read alignments?  If everything was done by a computer, there wouldn't really be a need for grad students, post-docs, and techs to analyze the data.  Isn't a lot of analysis still going to be required to be hands-on by a person?  
3.  You are essentially sharing your raw data with a possibly malicious 3rd party.  While I understand that cryptography handles a lot of the problems associated with this, who's to say that a rival lab could see my CPU request, runs the analysis on my data, and then subsequently scoops my work based on what they have learned from the analysis?

Just because a doctor diagnosed the disease as ALS does not mean that is the case.  Motor neuron disease is extremely heterogenous and we classify diagnoses based on symptomology which can be similar despite the root cause being vastly different.  Your single anecdotal cases aren't convincing.  Genetically, ALS has been linked to several genes which account for a large portion of familial cases as well as a smaller portion of sporadic cases.  As far as 10% of cases being familial, that just means that the mutation is passed on in families.  Mutations can also occur de novo (aka sporadically) which means that one of the parent's gametes were mutated prior to birth (more likely) or that environmental/toxic exposures resulted in mutation of genes responsible for the disease (less likely).  Large genome-wide association studies as well as whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing are being done to uncover these mutations that can be linked to the disease but which we currently do not know.  I'll point you to these 2 reviews for more information on the current knowledge in the field:
If there was a real link between ALS and Lyme Disease it would be being pursued.  The site you link is devoted to promoting the idea that you are giving me and is backed with little to no evidence.  In the case of Dr. Martz, he was diagnosed with ALS, but as I mentioned previously, this does not mean he actually had ALS.  [Here is an example of Lyme Disease]( presenting as motor neuron disease.  The antibiotics he took cured his Lyme Disease, not his ALS.  Because he never had ALS.

Yes it is definitely an easy implementation.  I'm sure they actually did it in less than 3 days with the rest filled with testing, etc.  I think the important thing is that stating how easy it is to implement gives other businesses a boost of confidence in switching over as well.  If they can use Coinbase/Bitpay and save money from CC processing fees and the system can literally be up and running in a multi-billion dollar company within a few days, more businesses have to be asking themselves "Why aren't we doing this?"   There really is no barrier to entry, which I think some business owners don't fully understand
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:15:09
baby steps.  As more people spend Bitcoin and companies start to see the savings they earn from doing so, they will offer incentives to Bitcoin customers.

@_date: 2014-08-07 23:37:37
This is an important point.  If Bitcoin succeeds, goods for the average person become cheaper because merchants are no longer forced to pay higher fees for credit card processing, chargebacks, fraud protection, etc.  What you need to realize is that Bitcoin is still in its infancy and if you bought any Bitcoin now you are still an early adopter.  We only see the large-scale benefits of Bitcoin when it succeeds on a large scale.

Mainly because the fee that is paid is more of a fixed, small amount rather than a percentage of the total.

A paper from 1990 that concludes people diagnosed with ALS, in a region with the highest prevalence of Lyme, also have a high rate of Lyme disease is not surprising.  Lyme can sometimes present as motor neuron disease.  In a region with high rates of Lyme, you will find that patients diagnosed with motor neuron disease also have abnormally high rates of Lyme.. because they have been misdiagnosed.  Why is this surprising?  If the study was actually important, where is the follow up evidence?  
I'm assuming you didn't read the two papers I linked that discuss the currently known genetic contributions to ALS.  I'm not speculating at all.
How could Lyme cause mutations?  It is a bacterial infection.  This shows your lack of understanding of biology.
I'll say it again; if there was a real link between ALS and Lyme disease it would be being pursued.  Perhaps the disease is misdiagnosed on occasion.  To say "95% of cases of ALS are caused by Lyme disease" is absurd.  
ALS is [globally distributed](  In the US, [95% of Lyme cases occur in 13 states](  There is no data showing that ALS  rates are any higher in  those states versus others or versus the global median rates.  Lyme disease is very rare in other parts of the world, yet ALS still exists globally.  
ALS diagnoses will continue to improve as we learn more about the disease.  For instance, in the case of ALS caused by a repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene (the most common cause of ALS), [proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients]( can serve as detectable biomarkers for diagnosis.  There is still a lot to learn on the causes of ALS and it is becoming more clear that several different mutations affecting several different cellular pathways/functions can lead to the same disease.  I'm sorry your grandfather was perhaps misdiagnosed, but spreading wrong information isn't going to help

Just read a little further :)?  
Study entry screening consisted of a Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Diagnosis (SCID) (First et al., 1994), the SCID II for personality disorder (First et al., 1997), CAPS, medical history, physical examination, serum chemis- try profile, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulation hor- mone (TSH), free thyroxine, HIV serology, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Subjects were required to meet DSM-IV-R criteria for the diagnosis of crime or war-related chronic PTSD, and to have treatment-resistant symptoms, defined as a CAPS score of 􏰄50 (signifying moderate to severe symptoms) following at least 3 months of prior SSRI or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) treatment in addition to at least 6 months of psycho- therapy. Exclusion criteria required freedom from any major medical conditions. In addition, psychiatric exclusion criteria included Borderline Personality Disorder or any current Axis I disorder with the following exceptions which were allowed: anxiety disorders, affective disorders other than bipolar dis- order type 1, substance abuse or dependence in remission for 􏰄60 days, and eating disorder without active purging. Urine drug testing for cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, MDMA, opiates and benzodiazepines was performed during initial screening and immediately before each experimental session. All screens were negative in all subjects.
Clearly, the exclusion criteria is quite rigorous.  It would be expected that a large amount of subjects with prior mental problems to be excluded based on what is required for participation.  It's not uncommon for a large amount of patients to voluntarily not participate and/or drop out of a study like this as well.

Your argument is wrong and silly. The market cap of Bitcoin is 6.2 billion dollars.  Bitcoin has no borders.  It is global.  It has utility for global trade.  Just think of how small a number 6.2 billion is compared to the wealth of the world.
If the richest 1% of the world ([net worth $110 trillion]( invested 1% of their overall wealth (1.1 trillion dollars) into Bitcoin, the price of a single Bitcoin today would increase 177x, putting its value at $84,845/coin.  
Just stop and think for a second about how small Bitcoin really is to the rest of the world and how early we are on the (potential) adoption curve.  The vast majority of people in the technologically developed world do not give a shit about what Bitcoin is, plain and simple.  If even a small portion of these people become interested enough to invest a small amount of money into Bitcoin, then the price will increase dramatically, far outpacing the small and ever decreasing pace of inflation due to mining.

this is likely a part of what Reddit Notes will turn out to be.  It is much more likely that people will make (and upvote) posts that contain reliable, sourced information when there is money working as incentive to those who make the posts.  I think this will be an important step in the continuation of "new media's" presence over the internet and carrying more weight to have a broader impact.  There are plenty of intelligent people on Reddit who are passionate enough about specific topics that they will take the time to inform others, but imagine what a forum-based website like this is capable of when those people are monetarily incentivized to make informative posts.

From the other thread:
The Sacramento Kings basketball team will become the first major professional sports franchise to accept bitcoin in return for its products, marking a symbolically important step in the virtual currency's bid to achieve mainstream acceptance.
"The way I saw it, bitcoin had reached a tipping point where it had crossed from being a curiosity to a becoming a legitimate form of doing commerce," said Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé, explaining his decision to allow payments in the virtual currency. Mr. Ranadivé, who has coined the phrase "NBA 3.0" to describe his vision for a National Basketball Association that uses technology to energize basketball's relationship with its fan base and establish a global presence, said the Kings' adoption of bitcoin "is yet another step in that process."
According to Mr. Ranadivé, the founder and chief executive of Tibco Software Inc., fans will be able to buy everything from tickets and jerseys to hot dogs and beer with bitcoin, whether via online transactions through the Kings' website or in mobile payments at the stadium. Payments will be processed by Bitpay, the largest bitcoin-payments platform. The goal is to have all consumer transactions open to bitcoin by March 1.
**Notably, Mr. Ranadivé said he will be willing to take bitcoin for the Kings' own account, unlike other merchants who have contracted Bitpay to process payments in the virtual currency but have elected to receive dollars at the end of the transaction.** He said he isn't concerned about the extreme volatility in the virtual currency's exchange rate because over time he expects to see increased trading and transactions in the currency and the development of more sophisticated exchanges and derivatives instruments. "It's only a matter of time before the volatility goes away," Mr. Ranadivé said.
The exchange-rate volatility, which saw Coindesk's Bitcoin Index soar from $13.51 at the start of last year to a November peak of $1,165.9 before it dropped to $757.50 at year-end, has raised questions about the viability of the virtual currency. The Bitcoin Index was recently quoted at $863.35. Such large price shifts are expected to deter the public from adopting it as a unit of exchange or a store of value.
But the past year's chart-popping price action has also stirred interest in bitcoin, which was launched in late 2008 by a mysterious person or group bearing the name Satoshi Nakamoto, a founder who has never been formally identified. Meanwhile, a number of investments by venture capitalists and tech firms in bitcoin-related projects have helped to expand and deepen the infrastructure surrounding the virtual currency, which in turn has enticed a small but rapidly growing number of merchants to allow bitcoin payments.
The question now is whether the currency, whose supply is delivered by "miners" who obtain it by solving a complex computation problem, can go mainstream. And to that end, Mr. Ranadivé, who first took interest in bitcoin after his children's friends asked if they could use their bitcoin at the stadium, believes he is playing a facilitating role.
Mr. Ranadivé expects other NBA franchises to follow his lead—as with other innovations he is bringing to the Sacramento team. Among those: plans to have his coaches wear high-tech Google Glasses on the sidelines to enhance their understanding of the play.
But Sacramento, the 19th-largest market in the NBA, is better placed for this initiative than almost anywhere else. On the edges of Silicon Valley and boasting a steady influx of high-tech firms of its own, the city is plugged into a "tech mind-set" to which bitcoin appeals, Mr. Ranadivé said.
The owner also benefits from a loyal fan base, helped that he is credited with keeping the team in Sacramento.
Last year, Mr. Ranadivé purchased the Kings for $534 million in a deliberate move to beat out a prior bid by Microsoft Corp. CEO Steve Balmer, who would have uprooted the team from its 28-year home in the Californian capital and moved it to Seattle. Ever since, ticket sales have surged, with the team registering the highest rate of attendance growth year over year and the highest rate of new season ticket sales. There is no other major sporting league team in the city.

one day they will realize that the world runs on incentives and the best form of incentive is money.  If you are rewarded for cheating (i.e. the current banking system "regulation") then you will continue to cheat.  If the incentives are aligned in such a way (i.e. Bitcoin) that cheating is discouraged, then cheating won't happen.  Bitcoin as a currency is integral to this aspect.

I agree that the merchant offering a discount requires much higher adoption than we see right now.  But you have probably heard many times that Bitcoin will go to zero or it will take over.  If it takes over, then this discounting is inevitable and it is just a matter of when it will happen and when the tipping point occurs.  That is hard to predict, but with the infrastructure being built up and the adoption rates that we have seen, it could come sooner than later.  I heard a good quote today in a talk by Ben Horowitz and he says, "technology, etymologically, means a better way of doing things."  In this case, I and many others believe in Bitcoin as a technology, which is why I think it will inevitably win out.  
First off, some merchants *do* incentivize cash.  For instance, many gas stations (and some restaurants?) will have a lower price for cash purchases because it saves them money.  Despite this, I imagine that the amount of people that use cash regularly is far too low for other merchant types to do this.  I am far from an economist and I don't have data for this, but at least anecdotally a lot of people (probably the majority in the U.S.) do not use cash at all or carry under $50.  We are very reliant on credit and even debit cards.  I think a more important point is that the majority of the population has absolutely no idea that they are paying an extra 2-3% for the items they buy.  I sure as hell had no idea until I started reading about Bitcoin.  Therefore, if the consumer has no idea they are paying extra, why would the merchant care?  They are still going to net their target profits by adjusting the price without the consumer even knowing.  Merchants aren't altruistic; they are in it for the money.  Clearly, credit/debit cards overtook cash as a form of payment for various reasons: convenience, security, etc.  Even if merchants did a 180 and put reduced prices for cash it wouldn't even matter, as people would still use cards for the reasons previously stated.  
Your second question is easier.  The answer is that you absolutely use credit/fiat for large purchases if you don't have the liquidity to replace your Bitcoin.  There will always be big fish and small fish and each has an important role in building Bitcoin.  I am a graduate student with very little expendable income.  I have bought various items on Overstock for under $100, ate the 1%, and replaced my Bitcoin because I believe what was stated in my previous post.  If I were to buy an item over probably $2,000, there is no way I would pay in Bitcoin.  The $20+ it would take to replace the Bitcoin is too much for me.  That's dinner and a few drinks.  Everyone has their price that exceeds the "I don't care about it" limit.  Have you ever seen Neil DeGrasse Tyson explain Bill Gates' wealth?  If Bill Gates saw a pile of cash worth $40,000 on the sidewalk, it would be the equivalent of you or me passing a quarter.  Everyone has their price and that's okay.  Small fish matter too; and the more of them, the merrier it is for Bitcoin's ecosystem.  
As an aside, I think a lot of the criticisms with Bitcoin are a direct result of its immaturity.  Yes, right now it's not as convenient to use for purchasing items, but that will change as it matures for reasons stated above.  Yes, right now it is volatile in price, but its market cap is $6 billion.  A few million dollar purchases can set a cascade of buying/selling very easily right now just due to the low amount of money involved and also the limited number of people who actually trade Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has the potential to become a global currency.  If it succeeds, its market cap will grow so far ahead of its current pricing that this will proportionally inhibit the volatility that it is exposed to.  Single entities can no longer move markets at this price.  But good things come in time
To bring this point full circle, I think my arguments imply that a lot of what are viewed as Bitcoin's problems and criticisms aren't the real problem.  The real problem is how to increase adoption.  If we increase adoption and Bitcoin user base, these problems begin to crumble away.  A lot of that venture capital money that is pouring into Bitcoin is surely going towards solving the real problem of user adoption.  I believe that Bitcoin hits the mainstream when the user has no idea that they are actually using Bitcoin.  This is analogous to the majority of the American public having no idea they are paying an extra 2-3% on their purchases and how the vast majority of people have no idea how the internet actually works.  And this is surely no easy problem to solve.  You and I may take the time to research Bitcoin and understand the potential it has as a technology, but we are unfortunately the .01%  Not many people give a shit about the Blockchain, etc.  Bitcoin is extremely complicated.  There is no way private key will ever be uttered from my mother's mouth with the underlying tone that she actually knows what it means.  Until we develop ways to make Bitcoin invisible to the user, I don't think growth will continue at its current rates.
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:40:08
this plus passed on incentives to the consumer from the merchant when it makes business sense to do so (i.e. when adoption increases dramatically from where it is today) is all you need to know.  Buying with Bitcoin right now is not better than credit cards in terms of overall ease/convenience (getting BTC isn't easy for some), as well as cost (you likely purchase at a premium or with some fee while simultaneously losing any rewards you obtain from purchasing with your CC).  On the other hand, you are secure and do not have risk of identity theft.  If Bitcoin succeeds as an experiment, then the small % of money that you lose in acquiring and purchasing with Bitcoin now will be meaningless to you in the future.  As many have said before - have some patience.

Yeah, I understand this and it's easy to blame me, but at the end of the day, the bank teller let an unauthorized user withdraw money from my account and therefore they are liable.  Cash deposits appear in your account instantly and the receipt says "available now."  I simply release when I receive a deposit receipt and see the deposit pending in my account because that is simply a good seller policy and helps in getting return customers.  Also, I've done over 300+ transactions without incident, so it's really not something that occurs frequently.
Anyway, the receipt tells the story and the teller  store  etc are all there and confirmed.  I just left the branch and I cannot file a claim until Monday as they don't do "Research" on same-day transactions.  Nevertheless, the associate that was helping me felt very confident I would get my money back, so we will just have to wait and see I guess.  All they need to do is confirm the deposit and withdrawal at that bank branch.  
If anyone knows if fraud like this is able to be pursued legally, please let me know.  Localbitcoins records the IP address of all users (do they hash the IP??) and I require SMS verification on buyers.  The user also had a real name listed, although the account is now deleted.  I'm sure he is on camera making the deposit.  I'd be happy to take a few hours out of my day to get some dickhead into some legal trouble.

@_date: 2014-11-14 06:33:02
I am talking on a large scale.  If you watch the video I reference, you'll see that the points below were what I was referring to. 
This is in reference to the lack of punishment for fraud and deception (see the events that led to the 2008 crisis) that regulations are supposed to impose.  Therefore, you can make the argument that the bankers at the top responsible for the fraud were rewarded for "cheating" because they got away with it and profited off of the losses of others.  The incentive to cheat is therefore propagated and rewarded again and again because the reward of a ton of money is worth the seemingly small risk of being caught and punished by the regulators.
With Bitcoin, the incentives aren't aligned for cheating.  I'm talking about miners here - i.e those that control the network.  Any miner that gains control of the network and executes a 51% will be spotted by other miners in the network, and their blockchain would be ignored, thus only allowing them to "cheat" the system out of a few targeted transactions before being caught.  Additionally, the miners that put in the effort to gain 51% of the network would be better off just mining normally -- because the Bitcoin incentive makes playing by the rules the logical and more profitable choice to do.  
Scams like selling pointless mining contracts have nothing to do with Bitcoin..they are their own separate entity and that was not what I was referring to.  The only way to discourage that type of scamming is to not have morons that will fall for them

@_date: 2014-07-27 19:43:46
I agree that you are correct that incentive to use Bitcoin has to be passed on to the consumer from the vendor.  I think you just have to realize that the amount of places where I can spend my Bitcoin for products in the real world are few and far between at the moment.  Likewise, the amount of people that own Bitcoin are few and far between.  As merchant adoption continues and trust in Bitcoin grows, I think we will begin to see the incentives come, the first being via online purchases, as this is the most likely method for Bitcoiners to spend their money.  If Overstock started offering 5% off of all products bought with Bitcoin, the amount of Bitcoin users is still so small that it won't scare their competitors.  Eventually, there will come a point where competitors will realize that they are losing enough potential profits to start accepting Bitcoin themselves.  More merchants accepting --&gt; more people using Bitcoin.  This scenario, IMO, is likely to snowball relatively quickly.  The problem is that we just aren't there at all in terms of Bitcoin users or merchant adoption.

@_date: 2014-06-10 23:15:54
The idea is that merchants would add a 2% discount to those paying in Bitcoin, thus increasing their customer base when the amount of Bitcoin users is high enough.  If they offer the 2% and it's successful, it will virtually force competitors to do the same.  This is why Patrick Byrne has said that Amazon will eventually accept Bitcoin.  The discount isn't costing them anything and it would be increasing their customer base.  I'm not sure what you don't understand about this?  If a lot of people are using Bitcoin and a large retailer offers 2% off all of their products for payment in Bitcoin, then people aren't going to shop at places without the discount.
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:34:48
Yeah I agree.  I think this scenario would be reason for me to switch to Circle:
Let's say I buy 5 BTC on Monday for $2500 on both Circle and Coinbase.  With my Circle account, I will have the coins instantly.  But with Coinbase I have to wait until Friday until the coins are in my account (my instant buy is only $1000 weekly limit).  
On Tuesday, Amazon announces they will accept Bitcoin and the price subsequently skyrockets.  On Circle, I can sell all or some of my coins for a profit on Wednesday, but with Coinbase I'm stuck in limbo.  Therefore, Circle allows someone to play the volatility game that is fun for someone who isn't an active trader on Bitstamp, etc, and allows them the opportunity to maybe profit on their purchase.  
Side note: why can Circle's deposit be instant but Coinbase isn't?  Or is there going to be a deposit limit for Circle as well?

Reddit is the perfect forum for this type of small altruistic behavior to reward quality posts.  Intelligent or insightful comments/articles will be much more commonplace and easier to find when there is a real monetary incentive to make them so.  I'm excited for what this can turn into

They would offer a discount as incentive for Bitcoin owners to use their store.  Most likely, they would do this when Bitcoin adoption is reaching a critical tipping point where a large enough portion of consumers are paying in Bitcoin.  If everyone eventually happens to switch to Bitcoin, then the discounted price would be "invisible" because everyone would be doing it.  In reality, the discount still exists because it wouldn't be present if we were still reliant on credit card companies

I was selling on localbitcoins, so there were quite a few transactions although the dollar amount wasn't anything very large to be honest.  Cash was going to coinbase essentially.  I was kind of expecting it, but it still sucks

I think the better takeaway is while the author may not be as aware as someone who browses multiple times a day, any other person who reads that article would definitely be intrigued by all the use cases of Bitcoin-related technologies.  The average reader of that article likely knows of Bitcoin as a type of digital currency, not as a decentralized voting, fact-storing, file-sharing, etc, system.

Your argument was about network hash rates being inefficient, which isn't strong due to the reasons stated.  This is a separate issue over block size scalability and tx/s.  Clearly, the network cannot process 100M transactions per day -- it is limited in that regard.  The processing of transactions will have to scale in order to accommodate and there are ideas and probable solutions in place to make that happen.  Are the two related? yes, but your point was about hashing power, not scalability.  
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:50:17
they could just sign a message to prove ownership of the address without actually doing a transaction
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:36:04
The argument is invalid because the same computing power now can just as easily and reliably secure a network that processes 100 million transactions per day, or more, and still be the most secure crypto-network on Earth.  Bitcoin mining underwent an exponential blow-up due to the invention of ASICS, and therefore quickly outpaced user adoption (see hashing chart below).  Right now, one could argue that the electricity spent to secure what amounts to a very small transaction network is indeed inefficient.  The important thing to realize, however, is that the network becomes massively more efficient when user adoption increases exponentially while hashing power grows at a slow, linear rate.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but ASIC mining development will not undergo another exponential growth because we are already pushing the limits of Moore's law, which I believe is at the 28 --&gt; 14 nm stage.  When user adoption grows, one begins to see that the Bitcoin network is massively MORE efficient than current overhead costs of a similar network such as VISA.

I just started a club on my campus not knowing anyone initially.  If you go to a school with 20,000+ people, there is a good chance there will be students who are interested in Bitcoin and can help you accomplish your goals - you just have to find and recruit them.  Once you have some people behind you, it will be much easier to promote bitcoin related ideas on campus and to businesses in a synergistic fashion (i.e. "hey business, we have a lot of kids that wanna pay in Bitcoin" and "hey students, if you pay in Bitcoin here you will save 5%") , otherwise they will wind up with no customers paying in Bitcoin and you looking foolish.

so let's say my friend is a seller/buyer and I'm a notary.  We are both legitimate for 6 months and build up our reputation as trusted on the network.  One day, my friend buys a car for $10,000 and I am selected as the notary.  As the network is blinded to our real life relation, he disputes the purchase and I side with him despite the car seller being legitimate. Of course, now our reputations are ruined, but we also have a new car.
What can stop this?  edit: never mind, looks like there can be another layer of trust in an arbiter?

neuroscience student here with a side interest in drug research.  there haven't been any psilocybin studies specifically on depression to my knowledge.  The most recent studies using the drug have found a few things:
[it has a dramatic effect on smoking cessation rates](
[it may help cancer patients deal with end-of-life anxiety/turmoil](
[it may be used in conjunction with psychotherapy for treatment of things like PTSD]( and possibly depression here as well.  MDMA in this case seems to be the option of more intense focus, however.  
[fMRI correlates show basically lowered activity between certain brain regions in the frontal cortex]( which has [implications for the treatment of depression](
[regions that make up the default mode network undergo desynchronization]( which again could indicate a possible treatment for depression, as frontoparietal activity is correlated with rumination in depression and this activity is lowered under the influence of psilocybin.  
lastly, [you can read a great overview that was recently published in the new yorker for some info on the psychedelic research re-awakening](

try to find a professor or student group at the university that know a bit about bitcoin (google it).  encourage them to start a club.  work with them to expand outward within the community.

this is good advice, but you seriously can't expect any average user to do this.  Coinbase is fine with 2FA, strong password.  They have multi-signature options as well.  If we want to encourage adoption, you can't have people put off by going through all of these hoops

you don't need massive computing power to analyze sequencing data like you do with protein folding, though.  sequencing data is more of a storage issue, if anything.  there really aren't that many real-world use cases that can be applied.
