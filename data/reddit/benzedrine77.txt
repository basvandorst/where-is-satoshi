[ 3 part mini-series gives a good depiction.

They preyed on vulnerable kids. The social services and police knew what was happening, but out of fear of being called racist they did nothing. And you said nothing was done? I guess litteraly you are right.

As far as i know, they have uncovered Pakistani grooming gangs in 8 towns and cities across England now. There will be more cities and towns uncovered.
You say the nationality/race/religion should not be a factor - but 87% of all gang rape/grooming rapes are done by a majority Muslim populous.  That is not me trying to be racist, it is merely stating the obvious. And we deal with the obvious by talking about it - fact based discussion, not discussions based on bias or hegemony.
These kids fell victim to a crime for 30 years because us adults did not have the balls to call a stone a stone.

So my accuser deletes his posts. Well, i guess the truth hurts some more than others. If you are reading this: educate yourself first, before laying claim on self-believed truths and realities. Naming someone a Nazi or racist should mean something, not something you throw around without thought. Now crawl back to where you came from.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:22:40
Two comments to me. Racist and nazi is what you end up with. Who takes you serious? You need help.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:42:38
I retract.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:46:30
lol Have you read the story of how the Pakistani shop owners grooms young children? 
If kebab shaming makes me a nazi then ;D
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:19:37
One girl was killed. She was put into a meat grinder and served on a kebab skewer. The Pakistani grooming gangs used their kebab and chip shops as bases to lure kids in with free food and drinks. After that they changed it to alcohol and drugs. 
Facts sweetheart - not lies, not racism. Facts! 
Deal with it.
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:45:18
Okey there buddy. If you say so.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:21:13
A kebab shop owner could be of any colour. In this case it was Pakistani.
So maybe i should have been more clear. Are you one of the Rotherham kebab shop owners with Pakistani background. And by the way: you accusing people of being racist is exactly how these grooming gangs could rape kids for over 30 years.  You are disgusting!

I never implied Robinson exposed the grooming cases, i said he shun a light on it where our national media were silent. For that he should be given credit, along with the likes of Sarah Champion, Nazir Afzal and others. All their voices were useful - or did Robinsons working class background with a few hard knocks disqualify him from engaging?
Edit: I used to share some of your beliefs on Tommy Robinson. But i made a case of looking into him from all angles, and not just established media. There has been, and there is a smear campaign against him. Just investigate it yourself, i hope you will. Things are never as clear cut black &amp; white.

Start with reading more news cupcake:
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:48:10
Context was the Pakistani grooming gangs in Rotherham and ++ other cities/towns in England. 
Learn how to read before coming on and commenting. Alright cupcake?
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:18:35
You shared that record 11 times now in the past 7 days. Seems a bit desperate to  be honest.
Are you as adamant to name and shame the Pakistani grooming gang members as well?

No reply?
The logic you are using is  implicitly how this monster of a grooming case started. The entire social structure that was built to protect those who can\`t protect themselves failed. Young girls with a troubled background and failed family structure were hunted by these Pakistani gangs. The entire social structure meant to protect these kids failed because they did not dare to say PAKISTANI MUSLIM MEN. And now you are using the same flawed logic to silence me. Don\`t you see the paradox here?
I am beyond trying to reason with fools. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:44:08
Lol... so kebab shop owner is a racist word now? Crazy world this has turned into.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:05:22
Why so angry?! Are you perhaps one of the Rotherham kebab owners?
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:14:10
Another kebab shop owner? 
Are you as vigilante to name the 1000\`s of underage girls who have been raped, drugged, abused and in one case killed and chopped up and served as a kebab? 
Or are you more concerned about one character who speaks up where nobody dared to?
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:39:51
Google it sweet heart. If you don’t believe me, then search it. Facts are facts - if you think facts are bullshit then that points more to your mind than anything else.
And don’t push your sexual orientation on me. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:32:48
Lol .. So you are both blind, deaf and dumb. My entire thread was pointing to how these PAKISTANI groomers got away with it. The police, schools, social services, council and every other government agency KNEW these kids were hunted and raped en masse. They did nothing due to the fear of being labelled racists - that is the point! Everyone knew - for 30 FRIKKIN YEARS!!!! 
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:27:13
The logic is gone, long ago. I guess sacrificing our own on the altar of political correctness and twisted left wing world order is the norm. 
And the worst part is; nothing has changed to better it. We are sailing off a cliff.
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:03:28
81.9% of the UK population are whites (2011 Census). So i would think that explains a lot.
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:29:44
Well, in my opinion the outrage is the grooming of young and vulnerable underage girls was happening for 30 years. 30 years where the city council, police, schools, social workers and government did nothing. Nothing was done to prevent kids from being groomed into torture, rape, substance abuse, prostitution and for some being killed. This has and is probably still going on in Rotherham, and in a growing number of cities and towns in England.
That is is the issue. That is the problem. The scumbags are the people out there that you haven\`t condemned once in your posts. Ever! So shame on you for condemning those who speak out.
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:47:07
Not enough to kill her. But this...And im being racist for saying kebab shop - just illustrates how far gone some are.
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:20:46
Read the context. 
30 years. Thousands of underage children. Crimes involve: rape/gang rape, murder, forced prostitution, forced into drug and alcohol abuse etc. Get the context before you comment.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:33:24
You mean the 2% whites? No i can’t, but im sure you can find the other 98% - just google uk newspapers. Hint: all surnames are muslim.
