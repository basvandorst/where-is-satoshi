I like how you only focus on the subject I already acknowledged you corrected me on and paid zero attention to my other points. It's almost like you posted the same thing twice.

Nobody answered your second question which was why did it liquidate at $120. Answer is because you set a "stop loss" transaction on the exchange. You tell it to sell the asset if the price gets to this number. It's a way of protecting yourself from loss. 
If you buy a count and it becomes worthless the loss stops at zero. When you short something its value can go up to infinity in theory, which would make you broke af. Shorting is very risky and not recommend for new investors. 
Please remember you shouldn't risk all of your money �� on crypto, it should be a smaller portions of your portfolio. That being said you're better off making bets here than on lotto tickets!

That poor kid being interviewed was sweating bullets when she asked him, in front of a rack of video games, what he was going to use a computer for. Ugh ugh, think quick Tim. I'll be using it for school work!

I wasn't aware brokers would sell off the account if you couldn't cover your losses. Guess I missed that section on investopedia. 
It's not like my interpretation does not make sense though. Technically the stop loss still exists you're just stating that company is managing it and not the user. That may be true but there has to be a percent of people who put their own stop loss in place. 
And "in theory" if the stop loss was not in place you could indeed lose an infinite amount of money.
