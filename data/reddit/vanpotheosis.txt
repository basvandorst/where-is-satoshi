I think BTC going back down to 1 or 2k is inevitable. The coin is still currently grossly over valued compared to any utility it brings in its current form.
The recent spike in value was a speculative bubble. Now we're seeing reality set in. Eventually BTC should be relied upon less as the defacto trading pair and the FUD which accompanies BTC will become isolated to BTC itself.
I don't understand why we continue to allow BTC to control the price of projects which have absolutely nothing to do with it and which are objectively superior in many ways.
Eventually I think people will get bored with BTC or else get mad enough at it that they begin to avoid it altogether.

Almost all of the hashpower is coming out of China, you know.
No China = insane transaction speeds and fees (even more so than at present). No China = $500 per Bitcoin.

Welp, good news. The BTC they have been "selling off" over the past two months, which has only just effected the market yesterday (weird), is supposed to be deposited into the accounts of those who were affected by the closure of Mt GOX.
How people getting a refund could crash an entire market (including coins completely unrelated to BTC) is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:04:37
I'm pretty sure they did ban it once and then renigged.
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:06:44
They don't use Google or Facebook. They made their own versions and use those. Ever heard of Baidu?
Which is why I invested a lot into NEO at 5 dollars. Figured they'd ban everything one day but still allow their own projects to thrive. I figured that since they pretty much own Bitcoin they'd end up keeping that running, but probably outright ban Ethereum for good.

Almost all the hashpower is produced in China... It is very centralized in this way.

"Come back from this"? Do you know how much Bitcoin cost last month? If it dropped down to 3k tomorrow most people who bought in would still be way ahead.
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:35:34
Crazy to me that Mt GOX refunding peoples money can cause the market to crash.
This is why we need to ignore the FUD and price movements of BTC and start trading our superior coins against more stable (fiat) trading pairs.
 
BTC is single handedly destroying this entire industry.
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:42:40
How can people receiving a refund / reimbursement of the funds they lost in Mt GOX possibly result in a market-wide crash?... That and this guy hasn't even sold any coins for the past couple of days. He sold all of the ones reported over the span of 2 months. _NOW_ people are freaking out? When he's not even actively selling any??
It makes no sense to me. That and it's not really even that much money compared to the overall market cap. It's a drop in the bucket compared to daily volume, even.

I was saying that there's nothing to "come back" from. There was hardly a newsworthy "dip" at all. I'm not seeing how that's offensive. I wasn't even 
disagreeing with your statement... Maybe adding to it, but not even remotely attempting to discredit it. 
Why is everyone on the internet so ready to snap at each other? Is this really how strangers speak to one another in person? I haven't experience it. Maybe I live on a different planet.

^^ Exactly. How do people figure that btc is anonymous? As soon as you buy them they're linked to your exchange account. From there everyone in the world can see exactly how much money you hold, have spent, who you buy from, etc. That's how a public ledger works.
Unless you paid cash for your coins and somehow kept that fact and your identity a secret, every transaction you've ever made is recorded indefinitely and immutably.

You're right about the analogy. I do like that one a bit better. What if I compared Bitcoin to WEP encryption? :-p

I agree with him. What makes this stuff worth anything? There are no smart contracts enabled on the network or any other 'features' that the product is 'supposed' to be used for. It's showing that it can't scale or handle network traffic of day trading. How is it supposed to handle being used for it's designed purpose?
I think the price went up as high and suddenly as it has because a bunch of rich speculators came down with FOMO and bought it up. The money could help them pull their shit together (how many chances can we give these guys?) but if the project continues to show that the code is poorly written and thought out then everyone is going to pull their money and the project will reset... Again.
A hard fork, roll back to 'undue' mistakes, massive pre-mining, unlimited tokens = zero scarcity and will cause inflation. Smart contracts are useless... What's the utility of this script? At first I was on board but I jumped off the boat when Vitalik, et al. began to get caught pulling unethical moves.
Is it a matter of time before Ethereum falls? Who knows. The markets are insanely irrational. I thought they would be DIW after the previous scandals and turned out to be very wrong about their valuation. Unfortunately, the scandals are still very real.

This article also eludes to the fact that if you're going to sell DO IT NOW, otherwise hodl on for dear life. Every speculator, professional trader, and analyst is going to advise a sell right now. Being 'emotionally attached' to holding Crypto's is insane under these circumstances. Sure, you may hold and the price will return to higher than it was before the gigantic dip that's about to occur (to every crypto on the markets).
Despite this possibility, my strategy is to sell while the grass isn't on fire and buy back in during the midst of the impending crash. Math says I'll end up with twice as much coin as I currently have if I just 'hodl'. 
Either way, I think most of us would be leaving at a profit if we left now.

A 'Gold' standard? Possible. But then we'd have to abandon that there is much inherent value in the technology itself. Just accept it as a "thing we all trust" to hold it's own price. Like the Diamond... Is that right?
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:36:39
Coinmarketcap.com is pretty much the standard.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:41:46
Huh... Not sure why I didn't notice this specifically, but yeah, this is true.
The difference I'm talking about is the amount of currency you can purchase now vs in the past. I'm thinking that there is more room for growth with other coins these days. Given that marketplaces and companies have been abandoning bitcoin altogether or switching to Litecoin for various reasons, investment in bitcoin is something that I am personally cautious of these days. It may have the largest brand but it also has the oldest and slowest technology. We'll see how it fares after a much needed update.

That's kind of the point of the post. We've already seen that the maxim of what Bitcoin is capable of mostly involves transacting illegal goods and services.
Aside from that it's the most primitive blockchain that is currently operational. As a proof of concept, I understand that it's been helpful in progressing the technology and bringing it into the public eye. But that doesn't mean that any well funded institution can't do it better. In fact, Bitcoin is one of the least robust and poorly thought-out forms of this technology in existence. This is in part due to the dilemma of having popularized a new form of transaction, and the fact that it was never designed to reach a mainstream audience or use-case in the first place.
The sooner that people move on from Bitcoin the faster this entire economy can evolve for the better.
As for Hashrate, the majority of it is controlled by 2 Chinese Billionaires. The great majority of the wealth invested in Bitcoin is from the Chinese evading their own government financial interventions. What happens when their government accepts this form of finance?
Something like Antshares are going to dominate the market. The Chinese always choose their own product over the dominant world version. I.e. Google vs Baidu.
 Remember, these surges in price we're seeing aren't due to the average American merchant deciding that it's time they 'get on board' and accept a 10 year old wave of 'new' transaction technology.
When the (77% to 80%) hashpower of what is currently powering Bitcoin converts to whatever the emerging Chinese Crypto-coin of the future is, where does that leave Bitcoin? Sans BTC being 5 years past obsolescence?

Gold also has intrinsic value. It's indespensible in modern electronics. I'll admit that the less valuable Silver is reportedly more adept at most tasks. But Gold remains tangibly valuable.
Imagine how many millions of Bitcoin have been lost due to carelessness that are never recoverable. Do you think that this increases their value?

Looks like a big push to just 'get this over with' to me. If it breaks out beyond 3,000 USD I'd be very surprised.
Then again, maybe I wouldn't be. 
What is typically true of market movements like this? A sudden explosion in price leads to a sudden dip in price. Not to the floor or anything, just something between the starting and ending value. 
But who knows. This stuff is crazy. And I only buy BTC to buy other coins. I don't hold any. :-p
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:50:34
Really? Even though some of the Bitcoin devs have left? I think that Iota has much better developers at the moment. To be honest, I think that they have the most intelligent team in the industry at the moment. 
That, of course, is not to say that the value of their coin is going to explode  or anything. Right now it's actually losing people a shit load of money.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:05:45
Bitcoin was never meant to scale. It's a proof of concept coin. If you want to actually use something that's scalable switch to Litecoin. No one is going to accept such a deprecated technology in the future of finance.
Satoshi designed it to be small and used for anonymous transactions between anonymous parties. That means drugs, human trafficking, piracy, and ransom-ware. It's an anti-establishment coin. 
The fact that it's being adopted by the mainstream is ironic and hilarious.
It's like Cannibal Corpse being played at every major shopping outlet in the U.S. during Christmas. kind of unbelievable that what has essentially happened over the past 3 months is the tech equivalent to hearing "Fucked with a Knife" playing at your 3 year old's birthday party at Chuck E' Cheezes...

Are you sure? To me Bitcoin isn't worth investing simply because the possible profitability isn't as high as several alternative coins. Antshares, for example, are currently sitting around 7 dollars. When someone only has 100 dollars to invest it makes more sense for them to buy 14 antshares than 0.036 Bitcoin. Even if you get a 30% rally in BTC you're not looking at very good gains unless you own whole bitcoin.
Besides that, Bitcoin is very old and is first due for replacement. Happy that they might get an upgrade soon but to me (personally) I don't find it an attractive investment 'opportunity'.
That's just my opinion, though.

Still, that's a rediculously massive number. I don't see how it could ever get that high. Sounds rediculous. You realize how many people would become near-instant billionaires in this scenario?
I that the total market-cap among all coins could easily reach 45 Million. But not Bitcoin alone. Bitcoin has been around nearly 10 years and was never intended to be handled so broadly and by so many people. It was designed to be an anon-currency for buying drugs on the internet. 
The only way it's going to grow to that scale would be if banks suddenly began to adopt and use it for everything, which they won't because it's too slow and the costs are too high compared to the technology they are currently using. In addition to that they would have to completely ignore the vastly superior technology that's already been released which is already available and much, much cheaper. Bankers aren't stupid. They know Bitcoin is a bad fit.
They're either going to adopt a coin that is designed for them or build their own for internal use among banks and never release the coins to the public.
