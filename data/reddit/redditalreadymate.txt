Coinspot if you’re also keen on altcoins, they’ve got a large selection listed. I’ve used them for a long time and had no issues to date.

Anger was 6k until now, depression is what’s to come. Historically speaking the main drop isn’t where people lose most of their money, it’s the continuous investments for the months and even years following that eat away at them. Bitcoin may rally in future but in the long run it’s a money pit in my eyes.
I doubt it’ll reach it’s all time high again, because the hype around it is unlikely to reach the levels it did mid to late 2017. I may be wrong but I now look to other, younger tech which is early on in its life cycle.

Bitcoin is still held mainly by early adopter whales...they could dump their remaining coins at any moment sending it down another thousand. It’s quite easy for the price to go lower when you look at who’s holding btc. Move onto the new cryptos because btc won’t see its all time high again.

Disbelief rally confirmed, looking like bitcoin has a market cycle after all. Hmmm..

He seems confident, time to buy?

Are market cycles exclusively for businesses only? No.
It does make sense...because btc has a market cycle, just like any tech. 
Tell me, how many purchases do you make each week with bitcoin? Do you buy groceries with it? Do people you know buy things with it? It’s use case has been hyped up by media and we saw the peak of this in mid to late 2017.
Now the whales have cashed out.
Why would people adopt a new currency when the current one is already fully established? Btc is not even relevant anymore compared to newer crypto.
You are exactly the person I was talking about above too. You are now buying the whales/early miners dirty laundry.
As for my “shitcoins”...I actually USE things like the Siacoin platform for all of my storage as it’s the cheapest storage platform out there.
