Organize a sort of "lottery". Have anyone be able to submit a bitcoin address for a period of time and then divide all the coins equally by the number of addresses and send them out.  Satoshi, having control over the site could make his addresses much more than anyone else can submit and redeem a big % of his coins, but this time in a large amount of different addresses, which would be very difficult to trace, since a lot of those addresses will be of actual people having "played". A kind of redistribution of wealth with a kickback to Satoshi ;-)

It's a rabbit hole. Once you start asking yourself question like where does money come from, etc... you start to understand what a scam the whole fiat-based financial system is. Because of Bitcoin I have a much better understanding of how the world financial systems work and why that's bad and needs to be changed. I came across the Austrian economic theory ([ is a great resource), understood what money vs. currency is etc... It takes just a small nudge to fall into the rabbit hole, but you won't regret it. Also, I'm a developer and can appreciate the the technical problems Bitcoin solves.

Ban Toyota as well, since terrorists are using it!

Ok, I implemented a simple script that tries to implement this. It uses a future block hash as  source of randomness. I know this is not ideal, since miners can change the hash, but we're talking about a hardware wallet here, no chance a miner will miss a block to win :-)
The code here: 
I'd really like to get your comments on this.
