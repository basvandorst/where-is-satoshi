I completely agree with everything you have said. I think another point that people look over is the psychology of numbers. Being tipped 100 dogecoins feels a lot better than being tipped .0001 bitcoins (not actual conversion), thus furthering adoption, making it "stickier", and more likely to be used.

You are correct. It was a gut reaction due to a multitude of factors. Was it hasty? Yes. Should I give the benefit of the doubt? Probably. I just don't want to be out $900 and have a bad credit score because of a possible scam. Eric emailed me quickly once I sent him a message which extends some trust but I hope you also understand my side as well.

It was an Amex account association problem. Eric fixed it and then some. I have renewed faith in them and am a loyal zealot to their cause.

I tried hiding this post so I didn't spread any more FUD but apparently that didn't work.

In this video  the ignorance is palpable.

A little of both? Teksavvy told me they were being hit with 6gbps in a DDoS attack and had never seen that before. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:35:46
I live pretty close to their main office and have visited it in order to purchase some BTC (they also run canadianbitcoins.com). Although it is just a hole in the wall, they seem to be very legit. I talked to who I believe was the owner (lightbox) and he's been doing this for years. They are very transparent and I believe very legit. They're here for the long haul.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:34:15
My mom owns a health food store in westboro and I think I'll be setting her up with bitpay very soon. I'd love to see more merchant adoption in Ottawa. Sadly we seem to be behind the times.
@_date: 2013-07-29 20:46:56
I have used it several times. It is definitely legit.

You have to send them some identification for security reasons but it's quick and painless.
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:33:16
I was under the impression they send a confirmation amount.

Hadn't heard about those. TradeFortress is very active on the forums and also runs BTCInvest. Always stay skeptical but I'm giving him the benefit given the evidence.

What didn't work exactly? @_date: 2013-05-17 00:47:49
City is Ottawa, provider is Teksavvy. The thread I comment in earlier today is in regards to this slowdown. An employee at Teksavvy called me. I don't have proof of the call.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:49:09
Well considering I was using the same basic password for all my accounts I'm not surprised.
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:53:34
If it's legit and proves to be trustworthy to the community I'm sure it could be successful. The time frame is also a huge determining factor.
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:53:03
Well my mining rigs went offline at around the same time as the attack and they are in a different location from where I live. I haven't checked on them since yesterday as I've been dealing with recovering my personal accounts. That would be an interesting hypothesis.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:25:38
All you need is a driver's license. From what I can remember when I did it, it didn't take very long to verify and once you purhcase the coins it takes about 10 minutes to receive the BTC. Max you can purchase from them  in the beginning is $250 daily but this gets better the more you buy. Make sure you have a wallet that can import private keys easily (I use blockchain.info).
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:32:04
Ooooh, it finally worked! My address is 1ZSa4gkXhvAgHctvkph5DvECaLDbMP5uY. I guess it just took a while longer than I expected. Not sure what was going on with my MultiBit but I guess I'll use Blockchain if I want to gamble my money away. Thanks anyways.

I would recommend reading this article if you haven't already:
The most BTC I have had deposited at one time was 10BTC. I have had various amounts in and out for the past month and have even invested in TradeFortress' investment fund. Suffice to say I have enough trust in the man (for the moment).
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:51:26
Sounds pretty good. I'll have to do some research on how to invest with them.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:02:33
 for using a credit card. Highly recommend.
@_date: 2013-05-27 11:37:32
I did some research and was sure MultiBit was compatible. Oh we'll, I'm using blockchain now.

I'm very wary to give any more information than necessary. I understand tech but not enough to know how much information is too much when it comes to tracking someone. And given light of recent events I'm quite paranoid.
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:10:14
I've been using it for about a week now and so far so good. I do have some concerns about the inevitable legality of the service but there are always some risks involved. TradeFortress seems to be a reputable figure and I have yet to see anything that would tell me otherwise. I would love to hear differing opinions.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:50:46
I'd love to hear your opinion on each of these options. I plan on curating my decision based on suggestions here.
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:32:14
I had the same problem. Once I enabled 2 factor I could no longer log in with my email and password. I then tried signing in with just my username and that seemed to work (although 2 factor took several attempts for some reason). If you haven't tried this I suggest you give it a whirl. If you have, I'm sorry and good luck.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:33:07
Also, $250 is about $260 Canadian. There is a $2 membership fee and $.30 fee per transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:00:07
Thanks for the in-depth response. Since I don't know the extent to a hackers capabilities your response helps to put my mind somewhat at ease.
I do believe I was using the same password when the original slush pool attack occurred, allowing the hacker to easily target my accounts that I had not already changed the password to (apple id/Facebook). I use the same public name for everything so that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:35:02
I just emailed them my drivers license. You don't have to do miicard to get verified.
