As a Canadian I tried to us kraken and found their support lacking and fairly poor quality. I have chosen not to use their service based on this. I mean it's been 6 months and I still have not been verified?! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:43:40
Looks clean and nice, good job!
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:36:49
honestly listening to them hurts my head. It's a couple of chad Henry's that invested and are happy about it. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:07:13
Thanks. Can anyone else vouch the quality of this read? Have you read it through?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:00:36
Watching these now. Great stuff! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:49
Wait whut?! Don't we want to educate people on what it is and how to use it? Don't we want more people spending it and understanding it!?!?

Great job man. You are my hero and someday when I have more money/bitcoins then I can shake a stick at I will do the same!
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:17:33
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:12:08
True and no I don't expect special exceptions for bitcoins at all. just wondering why they would make it seem like a big deal.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:06:43
This man just walked in and handed me this card. He said he was dropping it off because the government soon will/is now placing bitocin under money laundering legislation. He told me to visit his website and "check it out"....
well i'm on his website and it looks like a typical government structured "we are here to help"..."but really we are here to look like we are helping but really we are our own ponzy scheme bent on making your country a more restricted and monitored one. Oh and we are taking a cut for that by the way".
Basically I am wondering what this means and really what the implications are of bitcoin and money laundering related to my moms store here in merrickville, ontario.
Can someone explain what this mans job really is and also explain to me why money laundering really is a threat at all.

It's too bad I was really excited for this company being Canadian and all also with their edgy logo. unfortunately their customer service is terrible. It just takes way to long to get validated and to get any assistance with that and their other processes.

It was a back door trojan buried in a video game download. Turned phissing email virus got in and must have scanned for Bitcoin backups and keys.

Just an update the wallet I was using was "Bitcoin wallet developers" for both BTC and BHC and although I take full responsibility for my loss I highly recommend NOT using their wallets. They do not offer any level 2 / 2 tier security which is pretty basic. Had it required a Google auth code or text verification ..even a password to sign off on sending transaction i would have been safe. Hope many can benefit from this. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:10:28
I am very glad something good can come from this. Again I think it's the fact I was using a bad wallet with only 1 level of security and also had my backups just stored in my email 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:08:16
Yah I think the lsson here is don't use a wallet without two + factor authentication and also dont keep private keys in your email. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:06:13
Lol thanks
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:07:21
It was like $6k which is a lot but I have more in other coins so I am not completely devistated 
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:23:13
Where are these located? Are they not just the typical receive/send keys ?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:18:24
I have the standard "Bitcoin" wallet for my Mobile Andriod phone
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:22:08
for some reason they say you can split on this app but I see nothing anywhere on it and the guides have been not helpful at all. This is up to date also
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:51:50
Can't get the coins off of the site either :( !!
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:06:12
What are you talking about
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:35:49
I don't know I get an error message saying I have the wrong wallet code. Trying to resolve with support but their support crew is pretty savage..
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:10:46
No it doesn't yet. It will be exciting when it does tho! I personally will deal with bitcoin payments. Etsy is just a store front I use. Thanks for asking the question I should post it somewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:06:32
This is great! Thanks...Still have a bunch of coins already sold and stuck on BTC-E tho.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:30:32
How many coins we talking here bud??
P.s I'm up in Canada ;P

Seriously great job,
That interview could not have gone any smoother. It was accurate, calm and did a perfect job of explaining, for the time and preparation you were given.
 This was your first one and you handled it like a season pro. It felt surreal to see you so naturally dealing with this event. You not only expressed your points and interests with detail and ease but literally helped and are helping shape the forefront of the "currency" itself.
The idea is, like you and many others have said to increase the awareness and usage of the coin as the value is created by the power of human interaction and concentration in itself. Again surreal if you think about it from an abstract quantum sense ...but that's an off topic discussion :p.
I do not understand why so many people insist on telling you that "you should have or should" not mention puzzles. Sure this makes sense you/we got it after the first comment. It was your first interview and now you know. I am more then certain you will handle it with an emense amount of thought, clarification, tons of positive energy and  unique modifications the next chance you get. 
Again, you did an amazing job and I hope you know this whole community and all of its shareholders and supports are indeed indebted to you for this quaint yet huge step.
Was a pleasure to watch this and I give you my best,
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:03:55
Yah sure here it is I'll also put it at the link up top. Not much really tho. it's typical citizen positive and negative so no one gets hurt. Nothing really exciting about the articles besides the mention of the Montreal based bitcoin building and the fact that it's big publicity for Ottawa and the valley.

@_date: 2013-12-08 20:45:17
yay h i got a little excited ok! But still 3000 in just 8 days. Considering (in my mind) bitcoin is a long term investment.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:32:14
Well I plan on holding some for a long long time investment but I do think bitcoins will double before a crash so I want to at least try selling half at that point..but 10 days ..sure they might crash but at this rate I'm losing roughly 50$ a day to this. So if anyone wants to sell me some bitcoins let me know! :P
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:34:17
lol Figured :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:08:21
Ok well here is a question. What would the use of a bitcoin ATM be in the long term when (lets just pretend here) bitcoins are the mainstay currency. Will anyone use a bitcoin ATM and pay a 1-3% fee when they can just instantly do it from their pc or phone for free?
I am excited but also do not think I will be able to find anyone that will gladly or easily lend me the 10,000 I need to get it started. I have about $5000 ready to go...but would rather buy the robocoin machine then the lama.

LOOL no greater than the fax machine..damn son. I am a real estate agent in Canada and this office still JAMS the fax machine and paper storage for documents. Hilarious that we even still have these but this quote was a good laugh..

Good call. I'll look into it. The "Vancouver sun" which I am assuming is related to the Ottawa sun which has to be the equivalent to the fox news stated that it did 100,000$ CAD worth of exchanging at the machine...as the exchange / atm rate (of this one) are I think 3%? that would beeeee $3000?

lol love it
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:55:15
I thought about this a month back. It is not worth it anymore, unfortunately. It would have been and I know it sounds stupid "being one of those guys" but the cost to earn is too high. from what I have researched you would need free power  and lots / crazy machines roughly 30,000$+ to mine fast enough, it is over saturated. Buy into bit coins and even lite coins. or wait till the crash and buy then. That's my plan.

72 Views on my shop from posting it earlier today! No sales but hey people came and saw! Thanks bitcoin reddit :)

Hey I live In Canada.. My girlfriend loves puzzles.. This could be a great Christmas present...but it says no shipping to Canada. Help plox?

I think you can send them to your wallet or another wallet or site cause they give you the codes in account information.

I don't think this is necessary, sorry for the statement. Gavin is a genius look at how far steam has come and what It offers. If bit coin continues to hold strong and pursue it's long term strength and support then they will inevitably sign on, sooner rather then later.

There are other websites that do offer this service (i.e shops and stores on a map located so you can see who around you and or in the world that accept bitcoin.) I can look some up and link them for you If you want. 
I do like your site tho. It's basic and easy to navigate. There obviously needs to be some fine tuning and as it's up things will change, over time.
I feel exactly the same as you do so I can relate. I often post news articles or even my own business(s) on this subreddit looking for some feedback and general discussion...rarely do I see much activity and it leave me feeling..BLAH.
I'm am interested in getting involve in this bitcoin excitement and want to add my name to the lists and join up but it is quite hard when your forced to climb mountains by yourself. If you ever want someone to give you some advice or reviews let me know! Maybe we can co-lab something sometime. Two heads or coinier then one.
Here check out my personal shop 
p.s You must be a Pisces as well :)

Cool bro! You'll get plenty.I just posted some accepting bitcoim signs in my moms jellwery and craft store downtown merrickville, Ontario. We get the odd person asking me about it , taking a photo or mentioning it descretly...still have yet to actually TALK to anyone ingagingly about it :(.
I also have a qr code on my website so people can donate or buy my paintings. Its under going revamp ATM! But fun fact my website only costs 15$ a year to run! Everyone should have one and if interested ask me how!
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:22:25
That is what I am thinking... Do I have the money.. hell no..will I attempt to get it? YES is what I am thinking. My osap loans were 20,000$ I have just recently paid them off.
...Guess how much money I made from those loans?  It's around the numeros of 0.00$ actually i've lost money due to the interest lol. Apparently the robocoins cost $15,000 and the Vancouver one made roughly 100,000$ in profit the first 8 days. 
Do I think it is a risk? Yes but no guts no glory and without risk would humans have gotten anywhere? I'm excited and thanks for the reply.
