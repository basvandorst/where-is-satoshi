Sorry for the late answer everything is ok now with BTER, their support was pretty fast to answer, not to fix the problem, but answer was about some hours after my mail, and they fixed maybe 2 days later....  (Now I have same problem with Poloniex  I keep you in touch ^^)

Yeah probably , dont know in USA, but in France and Italy I m using this website,
(have my ref yes ^^ )
This is the fastest way and easier to get BTC,
You just have to go to the nearest postal service with cash and you can have in 10 minutes , no ID, anonymous ...

Im not sure if these guys from BTER support are kidding me  or are uncompetent .
I send them my wallet blockchain, a copy paste of my withdraw from BTER + a copy paste of my Wallet where the transaction have to go.
I show them by A+B the withdrawal never happened, they dont understand.
Any advices?

Hi, my 1rst post on reddit, I send about 4 or 5 BTC this morning from BTER to Crypsty, and a few hours later 1 BTC.
The 1rst one never filled  when the 2nd one is already ok...
(both are from same adress to same adress)
Im really starting to worrying, and as you can see a0091d86dc4877f69190343ee2ec70e6fbad5851d3cf313b29d935e3ac83be14
the transaction doesnt appear on blockchain (but BTER saying its filled)
So what happenend :( I m really sick these 5 BTC is nearly all I invested I m really having a bad time

Yeah I gave them the ID of transaction, wich doesnt appears on block chain, looks like they are scamming me, where can I find some help from community?
