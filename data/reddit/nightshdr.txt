**Subliminal stimuli**
    
The effectiveness in subliminal messaging has been demonstrated to prime individual responses and 
stimulate mild emotional activity. Applications, however, often base themselves on the persuasiveness of the message. Importantly, research on action priming has shown that subliminal stimuli can trigger only those actions that one plans to perform anyway: an action can be triggered subliminally only if the person already has the specific intention to perform this specific action.

Speech started, some live updates here:
# Introduction
# Collision between Banking industry and Tech industry
# Lots of regulations for good reasons
# Historical review on regulator status of NY
# Silkroad mentioned ( Hit counter = 1 )
# To the very least crypto currencies hold big potential reducing fees
# Remittance mentioned at 7% regular vs 1% Bitcoin
# Basic advantages: Creditcard information is not required - far less chances of identity fraud
# Advanced features: Programmable events, escrow
# &lt;sorry feed ended, can't update anymore&gt;
# &lt;feed restored&gt;
# Historical review on January hearings
# Regulation cannot protect consumers 100%
# MtGox mentioned ( Hit counter = 1 ) "They got what they payed for.."
# We wanted to move quickly, but not so quickly making mistakes
# Very complex area, comment period ending October 21st
# New comment period for the revised version will follow ( several times possible )
# Thanks given for the feedback given on the initial version
# Technology sector: Lightly regulated - Finance: Heavily regulated - crossroads between these fields
# &lt;feed cut&gt;
# &lt;feed restored, 30 seconds missing..&gt;
# Profound effects will follow on the financial system
# Changes 1: We do not intent to regulate software development! They do NOT need a license
# Changes 2: Individual users are not required to obtain licenses
# Changes 3: Banks are not exempt from the regulations 
# Changes 4: Mining will not be regulated, hosting wallets will be.
# Start-ups: Initial fee is going to require creative solutions
# &lt;feed cut&gt;
# &lt;feed restored, 30 seconds missing..&gt;
# Adoption and growth is possible but play by the rules
# &lt;feed cut, question session started&gt;
# All comments will be made public

Was traditionally paying lunch yesterday using a) bankcard b) 4-digit pin and it took about 20 seconds from start to finished. If we would like the world to change to bitcoin we need 1) Radically easy and quick payments 2) Some card which auto charges when near your smartphone wallet. Recharging up to preset limits lifts the concerns of theft or loss. So basically no authentication just very quick payments after confirming on the counter with a single "OK" button. Hold physical wallet near counter, counter proposes the transaction amount and the user just gives the "OK". This should take longer then 1 or 2 seconds in total. Lets hope we can win the race, banks are starting to move like the Rabobank's 'going to define new standards' etc.
