LOL yep. Staying disciplined within investing is difficult.
In the back of my mind I am still dreaming that Bitcoin is going to increase 30x.

I'm not going to hold on to my BTC until I am an old man though. You can't HODL forever. 
I want to purchase some property with my BTC.

Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:00:51
Yeah this is a good point. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Bitcoin and the level of adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:10:51
I'm going to cost average out above $100k. I don't need to catch the top. I just need to wait for BTC to reach $100k and begin selling slowly. I explain my process in the video.

I like the capital appreciation. That's where the money is. Flipping is more like a job. I like making money on autopilot.

The market is becoming more efficient - i.e. the bubble is getting smaller (as a multiple of the value dictated by the stock to flow). So you are right here that people are getting more clued up.
BUT - people generally do not learn. Especially the retail investors, but this includes the institutional investors also.
They just don't learn.
They get caught up in the FOMO, it happened in June of this year. I saw both retail and institutional investors thinking that the price was going to go to $20k per Bitcoin.
Then when the price stayed at $10k they got scared again, and people were selling their BTC.
When the price is going up, people always think it's going to keep going up forever.
This happens with every asset.
There won't be 1 billion people who will try to cost average out when the price is above $100k and still rising. There won't be a million people trying to cash out, there won't even hundreds of thousands.
They will begin cashing out when there is FUD caused by a declining price, once the bubble has burst.
People get emotional, and their plan goes out the window.
You're right though, hodling is the best way forward.
But I like taking risks.

Yeah the future of the property market, which is propped up by people's ability to get access to low interest loans, is someting I think about. 
Realistically I think I am going to leave a high % of my wealth in Bitcoin.

Capital gains tax is 10-20%. There is no 45% CGT - which accountant told you that?
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:08:13
Using a 75% loan to value mortgage as leverage. You're right though, you won't get a 15% ROI if you are buying outright without a mortgage as leverage. 15% ROI for a property investment is very low.
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:54:37
Yeah I have considered leaving a high percentage in BTC, and also if I cash out some and the price drops significantly after a potential correction, then I can buy back in at a lower price and increaes my BTC holdings.

The best way to secure your Bitcoin is to not tell people how you secure your Bitcoin.

I have experience buying and renting out residential houses. I don't know anything about buying land for leasing or development.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:19:18
Yes the whole security side of Bitcoin does play on my mind. I'm not an expert on storing BTC, so best not to ask me about whether your cold storage wallet can somehow forget your keys - that would be a really bad cold storage device.
I think the trick here is to do your homework, and make sure that you back everything up, and make backups of your backups.

Property is not easy. But it can be passive/semi-passive. You have a property manager handling the tenants, maintenance, repairs etc. They take a fee/cut of the rental income. But things can go wrong yes, but it's not a big deal - unless you are managing the property day-to-day yourself.

This is a really good point. Gold we don't the extent to which gold is finite. We know exactly how finite Bitcoin is.

Thanks for the share. 
For me the only critique is that it's a collection of points, but with no final conclusion. 
Personally I like to weigh things up and come to a particular point that will allow me to make a practical decision. 
You can never be certain, but you can make an educated decision.

Just be prepared for the possibility that the economy is going into a recession. There's no harm in having a contingency in place.
@_date: 2019-09-15 16:58:27
Agree that the media is blaming Trump is a red herring. 
The causes of the recession have nothing to do with the trade war with China. 
But the recession is not caused by the media or people's reactions to the media either. 
The media cannot cause an inverted yield curve, and the various other precursors to a recession and depression.

 Bitcoin is still very early, but I believe in the future when Bitcoin's market cap is much higher, the volatility will be reduced. 
Once this happens, the only advantage that Gold has, is its application and tangibility. Bitcoin is superior in almost every other aspect. 
Younger generations will think very differently to how we think. They won't question the viability of a digital store of value.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:52:23
There is no fighting. It's not based on emotion. It's not personal. It's a case of which asset will offer people the most advantages in the future. On balance I think Bitcoin will look very attractive to people going further into this century.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:45:04
Personally I invest in a number of different assets, including property and also gold. 
I'm not sentimenal about Bitcoin, I think it's a practical solution to a number of problems.
It also overcomes many of the limitations of Gold, as a store of value.

Read, or listen to "The Bitcoin Standard". After that I would start listening to the various talks by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.

I like to dream big :)
