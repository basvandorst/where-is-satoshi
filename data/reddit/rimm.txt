As someone who had no stake in MtGox, this shit is hilariously entertaining. Mark Karpeles is such a shithead.

Oh, I'm not complaining it's really unique and I just couldn't put my finger on where it was from.

Well there is an android app

Everyone knew about the internet in 99
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:44:09
Well he didn't write this article. I'm sure he has reasoning
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:04:29
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:08:51
My guess is he didn't want to dedicate airtime to actually setting up an account. It'd be a pretty boring thing to listen to. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 05:41:12
No shit? I was looking for a bar/restaurant in msp that accepts BTC
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:11:35
It's not very hard to grasp
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:25:21
I know this is a joke but this is my biggest problem with , everyone thinks they're going to get rich while having contributed absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:57:58
But it is used to buy drugs online
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:24:46
That's why I actually like that he was there. The things he was saying are actual thoughts idiots have. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:02:23
Where is Antonopolous from? his accent is nuts
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:58:45
The USD is not the only currency.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:48:44
Because it sucks having to enter credit card info
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:29:34
Uh not the NSA lol. Just from random hackers

I cashed out and more or less broke even when it jumped back up to 750 for a day. Keep falling plz.

I have .75 Btc in codebase. On a scale of 1 to 10 how secure is it? 
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:10:40
What would cause something to be flagged?

It's almost as if the English language is dynamic and evolves over time. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:26:18
Bitcoin' s idiots are just far more vocal
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:36:04
Currencies aren't necessarily stable
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:27:32
good joke
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:31:55
Then your friend is stupid or a liar.

So was this a one time thing or ongoing?

Vice articles are written by freelance writers and they seem to favor quantity over quality. Vice News is pretty legit though.
@_date: 2014-01-18 05:53:11
Yeah I don't really get why you wouldn't disclose the location
@_date: 2019-03-14 17:06:47
That's not a reason not too. Whether they pay off long term or short it's still monetarily more efficient and if btc dies in 10 years there is a strong secondary market for panels.

Price is up $30? HOLY FUCKIN SHIT! TO THE MOON!

Yeah no one but I should ever sell
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:56:53


Damn this is such an obvious con, can't believe it never occured to me.

I have no intentions of acting it out, but theres a sort of cathartic pleasure I take in creating schemes that I *could* do.

I think he just wants to brag.

Are you sure it's not Dunn Bros? We have those in MN

 Hope those keys are secure

A community that is so incapable of taking criticism that they downvote examples of criticisms.
*edit: parent comment was -4 at the time I wrote this.*
@_date: 2015-10-12 16:46:29
It's one of the most common reasons I've heard from people somewhat knowledgeable on btc and one I tend to agree with.
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:54:00
Ponzi scheme, few practical advantages over cash, associations with libertarians, requires huge amounts electricity, involved in crime.

Have you read half of the posts here
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:55:21
Next time? There will never be a next time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:57:32
Then have they done any research whatsoever? Have they looked more than 2 weeks back before deciding that the sky is falling?
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:49:07
I don't want to go to prison for selling drugs.  
Honestly with the exception of LSD and MDMA it'd be pretty easy for anyone with a reliable drug hook up to undercut SR prices.
@_date: 2013-08-28 19:31:04
If you're going to take a drug and needles aren't on the table of possibilities, boofing is the way to do it.

Not really, some people commit suicide after decades of depression

Who is to say it *was* bad advice,  btc goes up, it goes down, nobody has any real clue what's going on.  Bitcoin has always been extremely volatile, everyone needs to relax. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:19:34
pay me a finders fee and I'll let you do it
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:33:58
Yeah and addy goes for way too much on the SR anyways.
