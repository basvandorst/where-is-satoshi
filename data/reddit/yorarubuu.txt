I've been in the same situation when the price was lower, my obvious advice is just wait for the price to come back up, I know it's not easy to stay rational when you're loosing money but waiting is probably the best thing you can do.

Thanks, I wanted to try bitsquare already but I don't really get how it works. You buy your bitcoins directly to someone who wants to sell  ?

Also a Kraken user and can confirm that. However, I don't know if that comes from my bank or Kraken but transfering money with SEPA takes forever. Same thing with withdrawal sometimes.
I only use it to buy and hold though, not trading on it.

Might come from my bank then

Is it also a P2P exchange ?

Yeah it happened to me once, I sent a mail and it was released very quickly and easily. They have those little issues but mostly I find them  reliable and easy to use
