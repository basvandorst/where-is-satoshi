Same for me.

Ok, sorry, _self_.

Sorry, I just opened my account. :)

Personally, I think it's stupid and really wished it wasn't a "thing". Since we are dealing with lots of value and this is supposed to be a serious effort, screaming HODL!!! hurr hurr all the time makes the community look silly.

I had 2 BTC that I bought for about $400 total when all added up (bought in pieces). When it reached $650 in value and Christmas was around the corner, I bought a bunch of Amazon cards and took care of Christmas shopping that year. At the time (And still now) it was a good decision for me because I needed the money _right then_. I'd love to still have them in retrospect, but the future is uncertain.

I have no real knowledge, but I'm going to make one up and see if I'm right.
*I bet it is a safety feature to the other drivers to indicate when a car has spun out so that they can see from a distance and avoid the car in time. As soon as the car was travelling the correct way, the lights stopped flickering.*

I think NewEgg takes BTC...

I was was first attracted to Bitcoin because it sounded like a cool ass new currency. I thought, holy shit man! These are like Galactic Credits or something what a cool new tech. People would advise constantly to actually USE your coins then replace... use then replace... use then replace. Actually use it as a currency and that will lend legitimacy. Now, the advise is pretty much hold, hold, hold. That's not what attracted me in the first place.

Ok, now I am confused (somewhat newbie). Why Coinbase and Circle? I thought they were the same type of service...
@_date: 2014-12-27 06:11:17
Yeah, got nothing with two tweets. Whatever.

Fantastic contribution, thanks! $1.00 @_date: 2014-10-06 12:43:32
I'm with you on this one. My first thought was "who cares?" this guy (or whoever he is) can move his coin however he sees fit. No need to put his info out there.
I though Reddit had a now private info rule?
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:47:38
Is it Beta? I thought they opened it up for all and I don't recall seeing "beta" stamped anywhere.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:24:37
I am pretty new to all this, but I found coinbase a month ago and have easily been buying my BTC... does anyone really think it is hard still?
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:31:15
Not FUD, the exact same bank account and credit card I have in use on coinbase won't work in Circle. No feedback at all, just contact them - which I did a week ago with no response yet.

Posts like this remind me that I belong more in than here.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:43:47
Ditto, hasn't worked for me yet.
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:47:18
Oh okay no worries. I am new to this as well and I was just wanted some clarification. Thanks!

I am in the US, confirmed bank account and a credit card. Never have been able to purchase. I'll stick with Coinbase for now...

I'd love to see how well you could explain bitcoin to the mexican migrant workers down here (GA). I have a hard time explaining it to my tech savvy friends.

Being racist against Russian 'mafia' is probably a fairly small demographic to offend.

There still a chance that next year you'll say I wish I had bought at 9700 now that its at 15000. Or you might say, I'm glad I didn't buy since its crashed to 100... Fun times.

I live about 100 miles away from Atlanta. Homes here go for about $90 sq/ft. Nice, brand new houses with all wood flooring, marble counters, etc.

My barber uses Square and as such also has access to Cash App. I can just send him payment like that no fees.

Just like how the Air Force doesn't build the F22s, they use the equipment for missions.

Aren't person to person payments free, though? I give a buddy of mine $4 every week because he gets donuts and have never been charged a fee.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:40:01
WTF, where did you go to school and WHY did you go there?
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:14:03
I wasn't aware he was losing money on the deal. I just registered with Square Cash and invited him. Free $5 to cover donuts this week :)
