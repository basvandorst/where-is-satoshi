If they have minimal hashing power, all they have to do is redirect segwit transactions to their own addresses.

So we need to sacrifice all out bitcoins at once? What if I buy more Bitcoins? I have to repeat the process, so its not one time is it?
And what is this hidden cost anyway? if its 20x (or more in the future) the segwit tx fee (which is still far too expensive for micro-transactions), then I need to make at least 20x segwit tx's just to break even..
And it's not supposed to be about 'breaking even', its supposed to be about low fees!
It's an added cost, 1 time, or 100 times over a year. We need to take this into account, I don't understand why you wouldn't. What about when onchain transactions are $500? Will it be so insignificant then?

if you dont know the market well enough to *not* be anxious, you should definitely *not* put your house on it

So you need to pay the normal bitcoin transaction fee 1st? How much was that and why didn't you add that added cost?

So what happens to the fee when the blocks are full of segwit transactions? do we compete for higher fees again to get transactions included in a segwit block?

right .. I thought bitcoin started 8 years ago, my bad.
So until every wallet has segwit I will have to repeat the process and pay an ONCHAIN fee before I can use the segwit fee.
Does the segwit fee go up/down and fight for blocksize space as well? (hint, it does).
What happens when all transactions are segwit transactions and they are all fighting for block space? Do you think higher segwit fees will have priority?
When you see how fees and congestion have fared so far, how will segwit be different when users are fighting for block space with segwit?
p.s. with current weekly avg backlog, even if everyone was using segwit tomorrow we'd still have congestion. I'm not a genius, but the last couple of years shows us all what happens with congestion and fighting for block space.

If you would, why didn't you? Or is Bitcoin too expensive for you to use now?
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:34:49
it just **might** make sense to blame the companies **not** selling to the public
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:46:05


how is it miners doing this? we have segwit, miners aren't forcing us to use 1mb


maybe an educated guess based on past similar experience might help? e.g. full blocks
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:52:48
On SegWit? Never.

But those higher fees will constantly climb as users compete to have their transaction included, just like how the fees are now. So they will end up being more expensive as people try to use it more.
Or will they somehow stop climbing? If so, why? Will we have to stop getting people to use Bitcoin so the fee's stop rising? I've been seeing people here tell users to use paypal or litecoin as the solution to this .. doesn't seem like a great solution to me when I want to use bitcoin, or litecoin or paypal isn't accepted but bitcoin is..

You have to pay for the BTC transaction still, to even open an LN channel, the BTC transaction fee will remain intentionally high as the mempool on the blockchain will forever be congested, otherwise whats the point of using LN if you have no congestion and low fees on the main blockchain?
Do you see the problem in this yet? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:47:48
Remember, to use Lightning you 1st need to make the BTC transaction to create a lightning channel. With the onchain fee ever increasing you can imagine what fee's you will need to pay 1st to even start your lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:38:51
Ok, so we need to wait for LN, that's fair, thought it would be working by now, been years no? How much longer do you think we'll need to wait?
Shame that fee's will just repeat the same congested cycle and sky rocket until then.. thanks for the chatting.

ok, thanks for your reply :)
i keep getting banned for asking questions here :-/ so trying to talk/ask as nicely as i can
