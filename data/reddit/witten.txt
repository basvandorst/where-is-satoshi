I don't understand how this works. It takes 10 months to get back 105% or 110% of whatever amount I put in?

Looks like many Greeks are already embracing an [alternate, local currency]( called TEMs. It sounds to me like it's probably a [LETS]( incarnation.
For those not familiar with LETS, it's a basic community currency framework where there's a centralized ledger tracking how much money is in each account.

What makes you think a hacker is going to check their changes into a git repo?
@_date: 2012-06-29 15:08:55
Nope, inflation. As long as new blocks are being mined faster than people are losing their wallets, bitcoin will remain an inflationary currency. It's only once mining rewards eventually taper off to nothing that it becomes deflationary.And that won't happen in the next ten months.

Edit: It's compounded daily!

If the Block Chain server is serving the JavaScript that's managing your private keys on the client, then that JavaScript can do anything up to and including sending your private keys back to the server. The only thing that's preventing them from doing that is an interest in maintaining their reputation and their avoiding getting hacked, thus far.

Edit 2: The 6% is still only an APY though.

Yeah, right now the inflation rate is approximately 33% a year. After the drop, it'll be 12.5% a year. [Citation](

That's going to be pretty tough to meet or beat bitcoin inflation over the next 10 months.
@_date: 2012-05-06 22:39:24
6% doesn't sound so great once you realize Bitcoin inflation is currently somewhere north of 30% per year.

It would have to be BTC deposits from Mt.Gox users, not fees from commissions.. for exactly the reason you point out.

Mmmm.. alpaca burgers.

The question still remains though.. Why did he lie about the SQL injection and compromised admin account previously?

Doesn't it seem like an unlikely sequence of digits for the sum of the Mt.Gox funds?
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:08:40
Indeed. I'll speculate that the hacker could have gotten into Mt.Gox on June 12th or even earlier. (Initial offers to sell the Mt.Gox user database appeared on the 17th, and reports of hacked accounts occurred even earlier.)
And it was multiple addresses, not multiple accounts. If this was a hacker's doing, he very well could have been using Mt.Gox's existing generated Bitcoin addresses, and withdrawing money via them to a single external address.
