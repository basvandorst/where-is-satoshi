Sorry! I should have been smarter. :(

No, and I didn't say that *hypothesis* wasn't! I said that I won't accept it until it's shown to hold water as a *theory*. Do you see how your first statement here illustrates what I'm saying? It's a bit of impossible to prove or disprove rumour, essentially. A good assassination is hard to physically prove, but does that mean that *every* single-car crash fatality should be looked at suspiciously? Obviously, I understand there is more ***circumstantial*** evidence involved here, but there's nothing that we can actually prove as a link. The WikiLeaks report doesn't even really support this hypothesis because it says that the CIA started to look into this in 2014, when this crash happened in 2013.

No, I don't mean. Industry experts and [independent journalists]( are my sources on those claims. The video I think you're referring to was an exploit of GM's OnStar cars and it doesn't apply to the car in this story, since it was a Mercedes C250. I also am dubious of your first statement because I haven't seen any convincing evidence from people who assert that. I am open to change my mind if there's evidence, but I haven't seen it yet.

I'm not freaking out. I'm done with this convo because it's a mess. [Hypothesis](
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:54:43
It's not that I don't acknowledge it's a possibility and definitely not that I don't understand how it would work (I mean, the literal reports of what literally happened are how it would happen...), I just think that we don't have enough info and concrete connections to say conclusively that this is what happened. In fact, I'd say the evidence we have encourages a skeptical view rather than jumping to a conclusion. There are points on both sides, but nothing points to it definitely being an assassination right now.

That's not a new hypothesis at all. As soon as that story broke, [people thought this had happened]( Now, I'm not familiar with how they'd go about this hacking, but back in 2013, the consensus (in the public sector, it should be said) was that remote controlling most cars, Merc C250 included, would be impossible without physical interaction and less practical/effective than sabotaging the car in traditional ways. I'm still not convinced by the facts we have and the intel in the WikiLeaks dump since there's no proven connection.
