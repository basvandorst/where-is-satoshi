Wouldn't it be nice if people in all countries could enjoy a payment system where transactions went through quickly and cheaply?  I wonder what we all could do to get there.

This is the same with all coins though.  Bitcoin needs to thrive.  We need to get a lot of people using RootStock, Liquid, Lightning as well as get other devs/communities to create working, useful sidechains.  
I'm really disappointed in the rate of RootStock adoption.  This needs to take the place of Ethereum.  What can we do to speed this up?  
Also, people should be using Liquid a lot more until Watchtowers and Amp are thoroughly working--probably after too.  Why can't we buy Liquid or RootStock BTC on a ton of exchanges now?

Your estimates are off.  
  


No, but less than 1% is peanuts for a limited supply global currency with multiple transaction systems, dApps on sidechains, etc.

You know of no working code now for amp?  That is surprising and alarming if true.
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:45:20
Thanks so much for the detailed answer!  
I wonder would it be possible to have multiple types of AMP where the clients can signal what type they have the capability to use.  
I'm upvoting a lot of your posts now for that effort.

You should look at Tox.  It's not theoretical and already doing what you suggest.

Tether, USDCoin, TrueUSD these are all FedCoins.  It's a damn invasion and there are others I didn't mention.  If it's legitimately backed by USD through some bank, it's a FedCoin.

Heck here's another nice video from Khan Academy saying the same thing. 
  
If you don't believe these things, call your local bank.  Everyone is not lying to you.

Banks DO NOT SEND PHYSICAL CASH to one another.  You need to unlearn a lot of what you've tried to teach yourself.

It's literally economics 101.  Take some time.  Go back and revisit your newfound understanding when you don't feel like trying to win an argument or whatever it is you're doing.   
I think one thing confusing you is only the Treasury can PRINT US dollars by law.   You seem to have constructed an entire money theory around that for some odd reason.
@_date: 2018-12-29 19:31:24


That's literally what a US dollar is.  I don't think you understand fractional reserve banking.  You do know banks create US dollars right?  This is no different than any other US dollar they create.  
I think this may be at the heart of your confusion.   Nothing else matters if you don't understand that banks literally create US dollars.  In effect, there is no difference between a bank creating a US dollar and a bank creating a token backed by a US dollar.  It is quite literally only a difference in accounting.  


Entirely unrelated.  For all intents and purposes, as soon as the US govt. accepts US bank backed cryptos, you have a full FedCoin.  
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:03:30
Hopefully you can get all the links to the sources you need from the citations on Wikipedia.  I promise you all these people aren't lying to you.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:07:08


This is also incorrect.  The Treasury absolutely cannot create US dollars.  The Federal Reserve can and does create US dollars and does loan them to the Treasury in exchange for US Treasury Securities.   The Treasury does actually print a portion of those US dollars into physical bills--one of their responsibilities.

I hope you never get some weird notion of what and where the clitoris is.  By god, your wife will never  be a happy woman if she has to go through this.  What you're doing is insane.  You're literally leaving out things from context and picking and choosing what you read trying to fit your view.  It's wrong friend.  It's no big deal to be wrong.  It's insane to keep an incorrect view though.  


....and here's the full quote.  Literally telling you banks create money. 




WHAT!?!  I literally pay my taxes this way every time. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:47:26
If a US bank truly backs up Tether one for one and the others it truly is that simple.  No idea why you even mention that.  Perhaps Tether is backed by a foreign bank, I don't really know.  I don't believe they all are.  Coinbase has a stable coin now backed by a US bank I think.  That is indistinguishable from a US dollar in real terms other than one rule change. 
Also, banks don't only invest in Treasury Notes and that is beside the point anyhow.  No need to try to obfuscate.    
A banks reserves are used to determine how much it can lend.  That is the primary feature there.  Still, it's unrelated.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:31:27
Doesn't matter.  If it's backed by a bank, it's a FedCoin.
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:44:10
I believe you to be an insane person.  Good luck in life.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time attempting to educate the insane.

Ok, you need some basic Econ 101 I see.  Here I'll just let this guy do the work.  You're in for a treat.  Enjoy the tutorial.  
  
Fractional reserve simply means a bank can loan out a certain fraction of the reserves it has.  This is called the money multiplier.   It is set by the Federal Reserve.  
US dollars are quite literally claims against private institutions.  Those claims are transferable between all the institutions in the Federal Reserve system.  That is part of the inter-bank accounting system.  
By the way, surprisingly the Federal Reserve is a private institution itself.  
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:28:39
No, it doesn't.  Contact your local bank.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:45:13
Ok, your understanding is just fundamentally wrong.  I don't know where you've gotten these crazy notions but it's just silly.  Anyhow, good luck to you.  
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:01:46
Hell here you go:  Wikipedia. 
  




The central bank, or other competent, state authorities (such as the Treasury), are typically empowered to create new, physical currency, i.e. paper notes and coins, in order to meet the needs of commercial banks for cash withdrawals, and to replace worn and/or destroyed currency.[30] The process does not increase the money supply, as such; the term "printing [new] money" is considered a misnomer.[1]

They are the exact same thing as US Dollars.  The US Dollar is literally an IOU as well.  
This is precisely how the Fed will create digital dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:43:17
You have lost your mind.  Good luck to you sir.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:49:34
Banks create money.  Get over yourself.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:20:17
It is.   Go look at the top of any US Dollar denomination and see what it says.  
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:29:39
So you don't believe Khan academy and you don't believe Wikipedia.  What law are you looking for?  Are you looking for a law that says, yes banks can create money?  Lol.  
Honestly I think all your problems started when you conflated money printing with money creation.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:48:27
It's honestly hard not to find this information anywhere. 
  
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:07:31
What do you think you've linked to?  That link is literally what I told you.  The Treasury PRINTS US dollars.  I imagine as time goes by they'll need to maintain less and less of this printed money.  The vast majority of US dollars are digital--in each banks servers hard drives.  
Do you think banks send physical dollars to one another when you transfer money?  
Edit:  
If I buy something from a store with my debit card, do you think eventually they have to resolve that to physically printed dollars?  
Anyhow the answer is no.  It never resolves to physical dollars.  In fact, if I remember right, only about 10 percent of the worlds money is physical.  The rest is in checking accounts, savings accounts etc.-- digital dollars.

There never was an argument or discussion.  You are a crazy person that defends his inaccurate world view at all costs.  You are nuts.  It just took me far too long to realize.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:42:47
Ok, I'm out.  I suggest you simply contact your local bank and ask them what EFT is and how it works.
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:07:51
That is an excellent point!  All they have to do is make that one rule change and the plan is complete.   That's they way I'd do it.  Start this way, then simply allow people to pay taxes with them.  It's the ideal way to experiment and get their foot in the door.  
Just a few years ago, this part wouldn't even have been legal.
