Why so?
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:31:52
You know they cannot drag their heels any longer right? 10th is the last date.
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:53:48
Not this time bud, not this time.
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:56:04
How much of the market has China been do you think?
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:54:08
The price won't drop even after the ETF gets blanked, too much potential upside with what's happening in Le france.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:28:31
You're em, voting Le pen in right?
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:07:47
At any point.
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:01:36
Sorry yes 11th. I don't understand why they'll wait till last minute though?
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:25:44
Too much momentum, too little PBOC can do

Hard moon.

Is it just me or is it poorly written?

Fintech is bitcoin imo, this changes everything,imo.

@_date: 2017-02-24 05:26:09
The article would like you to know that you need banks, always and forever.
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:32:13
I think I'm trying to say that generally I feel like he's pro enterprise and seen as there's so much happening with bitcoin and that it's a wave that's coming whether you like it or not that he might just push his guys in the SEC to let Murica on it now.
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:56:35
The ETF will be approved, they need to get some sort of tabs on this bish quick.
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:51:07
TLDR - The author thinks people won't bother adopting bitcoin because change.
He then goes on to contradict this line of thought by suggesting that when consumers do infect decide to change it might be a different cryptocurrency.
This dude knows not much, not much at all.  NEXT.
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:32:24
Yes daily.
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:55:39
Why do they want to scare the SEC?
@_date: 2017-02-04 03:43:05
Your personal what?
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:55:04
Is it going to be conservative business at usual at the SEC or it the Trump effect (rapid unforeseen change) going to be a factor?
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:58:49
This article is basically saying what a bank would say if you asked it should you use it instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:33:17
Whatever height the moon is currently orbiting at.
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:34:48
Did you say moon? Yes, yes that's where we're headed thank you byyyyeeeeeeeee.
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:49:34
I'm hearing reports that suggest she may get in unexpectedly in much the same way Trump did. 
I didn't know she had a stance on bitcoin, I just know she said she'd leave the euro which would lead to redenomination and so hopefully a significant rise in the value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:27:57
A Bull Whale mid morphing into a Bull Bear? Could it be?
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:52:45
Um, what prices? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:58:12
Awesome, when if ever should I start to worry?
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:08:05
Ok but what happens if this totally unique event propels bitcoin out of my reach from Mar 13th onwards?
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:42:23
The uncertainty about the future of the EU created by the french election.
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:23:36
Ok great, so maybe on the 14th then?
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:59:38
Are they embedding them in themselves? Embedded chips are a thing now aren't they?
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:24:52
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:15:32
I think all of the ETF's will be approved. Trump slashing regulations, Mulvaney et al being in decent positions, BTC's raw power and steadfastness. The clear failure of the current paradigm. It's time. 
Buckle up. Over and out.
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:22:55
What if the etf gets the green light and it goes lunar?
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:17:59
And so it begins.
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:32:47
No this is not a scam jabbatheslutboi.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:39:19
It's certainly a lot more comforting to think it will be just a small group of miners that will switch to BCH, do you have any particular reason for thinking this though?
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:47:57
It must be, what else could it be? This is it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:04:54
You feel like every nation and government is beholden to the current system? I think you would struggle to find people that agree with you.
I mean there are obviously lots that are but I think it's fair to say that there are some who aren't and will welcome change like this.
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:40:59
C'mon, lets put politics aside and try and analyze what's coming down the line. We are in an important phase of BTC's development I think.
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:41:56
That delay gives them the ability to make large sums of money off of your money if the market moves a certain way quickly. I don't believe it's accidental.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:33:28
Wow, I did not know a lot of this stuff, having second thoughts now.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:10:38
     and this?
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:37:22
It's actually a better way to disable it imo.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:28:55
Oh it's a pump for sure, no arguments there. You're wrong with the dump part though and should be able to see that if you think it through.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:10:51
Sorry, has it been wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:31:11
If can't happen as long as BTC keeps rising like this, sorry to burst your bubble.
It can only happen if BTC somehow crashes.
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:40:39
Quite possibly thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:27:26
Exactly, the miners will be like "fuck this extra money bullshit what we care about is ensuring people's trust in crypto is maintained".
Oh the lies we tell ourselves when we wanna cling on.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:55:16
People who don't understand will say "pump n dump" , people who do are already swapping their BTC for BCC as we speak.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:45:20
Because they don't care if BTC crashes, BCC is where they're at now and that will surge to replace BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:21:29
This is not bad.
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:08:41
It is?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:02:51
It certainly would.
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:18:30
I have recently dealt with QuadrigaCX and would consider my experience negative also. 
When I went to transfer my BTC off their exchange for the first time I was unable to as the "setting" on my account was set to not allow this (wtf?). It took me a while(days) to rectify this and I had to chase them down to do it.
Then when I eventually was "allowed" to transfer my BTC off their exchange (thanks guys) it took a few hours just for them to process this bullshit. I guess those few hours could be very valuable if the currency was moving quickly in value.
My feeling with them is they don't have enough people/desire to treat me how i want to be treated and shit is slow with them. They basically treat you poorly in a slow fashion imo lol.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:09:15
Just discovered this, how long has it been down?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:23:16
Why not try and attack the actual post instead of the poster? 
Ironically it's you who appears more like a shill.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:21:37
What do you think are the chances of some being able to and wanting to leave the aforementioned structure? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:38:38
Yep, just me. I'm the one causing all this :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:21:48
You do see that today's numbers reflect this right?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:47:37
You would prefer if I stopped lol?
My words are hurting your brain?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:35:21
Haha I meant the content of the post not the actual post.
Do you have any actual counter-arguments lol?
Are you beginning to see your foolishness yet?
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:30:03
         You reckon the powers that be will stop this ?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:27:04
There is none except stfu, we are invested in BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:03:03
Change always come before it's expected and quicker than envisioned. Or something like that.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:06:44
Lol, thank you for existing, without you I wouldn't be making so much money today.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:02:33
or it's true.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:37:59
Not once institutional money starts coming in which is now so no.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:09:16
Yep,institutional money has been piling in since the ETF decision on the 10th of March.
Don't expect any significant dips from here in.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:11:50
Fuck, I was really thinking it wasn't so cut and dry and that some countries would be different - like Norway or Iceland for example.
What if all the countries get together and decide to ban/outlaw BTC? They might all rally together to protect the current system?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:16:06
Are you certain of this? What if some nations decide they have had enough of the current system and would like to use BTC as the standard? 
I think you should change your statement to " those that currently hold the reins of financial power will do anything to stop bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:26:10
He doesn't like it as a store of value because - "what if they decide to print another 21 million" - I think this is kind of simplistic. 
He uses India's taking their fiat monetary system online as an example of competition to BTC or something - he doesn't seem to be seeing much value in the decentralised /deflationary/immutable aspects BTC brings. 
This dude doesn't really seem to see BTC as anything too revolutionary, has he even seen any of Andreas' vids? Does he know where we have set our sights?
This dude ain't ready.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:04:12
It's institutional adoption imo, mass adoption by the average pleb will be the final stage.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:18:30
Seems like the political support might be something to note?
Will it be replicated across other territories?
@_date: 2016-12-17 20:43:47
I definitely plan on buying and selling more however aren't exchanges prone to hacking? 
I'm thinking staying anonymous might be a good idea for when there is a confrontation between bitcoin and the legacy powers.
@_date: 2016-12-17 06:16:22
Thanks for reply. I'm in Saskatchewan. I'm looking to speculate/trade about 10 coins asap and if I could do it anonymously it would certainly be a strong preference.
@_date: 2016-12-17 06:50:35
Thanks. Seems like there's about a 5% premium for privacy, which is a lot.
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:52:53
Thanks,any idea about their rates? Can't seem to find anything on their website
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:59:20
What country are you in?
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:42:43
Yes your phone has been ported over to a hackers phone and they have used the 2fa to access and hack your accounts.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:31:46
3500 by tomorrow morning. I called the very top incidentally.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:44:57
Sorry bud but it's going lower too.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:44:20
Say hello to 3k
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:47:35
And there's the top.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:41:51
Yep lots of flames for now, next stop $3500.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:32:23
The Reversening - I've been waiting for it for what feels like a long time now. I still believe.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:31:57
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:47:04
A situation a bit analagous to my ex I'm thinking.
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:46:27
Nope, polo's been abandoned for a while now, I don't even know if people still work there.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:24:27
These are all lovely things to say about BTC however we need to look at the actual bubble and not the underlying asset. Bubbles ALWAYS burst, end of story, every bubble ever has burst.
Now lets examine this particular bubble - how inflated is it relative to previous values? BTC has trebled in value in approx 3 months, that's how inflated it is. It's been around years but trebled in value in 3 months.
I see no way that this doesn't pop unless we get mass adoption immediately, and that's not going to happen so prepare yourself mentally to say goodbye to all your dreams for now.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:27:37
Are you ready for the crash? They are soooo busy they didn't even have time to or resources to hire more people and so had to use the trollbox guys lol. Empty ship bro.
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:02:02
Volatility will decrease over time as it grows.
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:18:59
It rises by it's very nature, it needs not reason.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:12:53
remindme! 4 years
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:28:45
It seems unlikely - BTC seems to satisy most of the requirements of what it purports to be and has the ability to be the only one that occupies its space imo.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:46:37
That's a link to a nice google search you created but it's not the article in question.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:50:08
It had more users and uses in 2013 than today? It was more hyped? I wasn't around then so I can't really say tbh.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:15:07
We are not talking about the long haul we are talking about right now and right now BTC is in a huge bubble that is about to burst.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:07:31
Yes this guy has been gentlemen and has professed an interest in being gentleman again in the future and why should he not? Why should we all not?
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:52:44
If only it was bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:19:32
Too much network effect, hype etc for that to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:27:00
Me neither.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:48:02
This must be Satoshi, if not then he deserves to be.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:11:34
If they start their own they will not be decentralised currencies and so will be merely databases, they mean current crypto - BTC. 
This is the most bullish thing I've heard to date, the IMF has literally moved past the combatitive phase recognising it as futile and immediately on to the co-optive phase. This, is, gentleman.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:52:25
link?
