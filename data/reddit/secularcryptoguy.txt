See this is where you and I disagree. There is no reason to abandon Capitalism in the field of banking and embrace soviet style central planning.
But I am going to quote something here:






You're convinced that if not for central banks, there will be crazy booms and busts, but the truth is, it's because of the central banks why we are in this problem.
Finally, with bitcoin, the control is being taken away from the Central banks and handed back to the free market.

I know what you're saying, but the problem is that there are literally no implications of the statement "There are only 21 million Bitcoins and that's all there ever will be" which is refuted by OP's assertion.
So tomorrow they divide a bitcoin to 14 decimal places that means the smallest bitcoin is now equal of 1 million satoshis, but it doesn't mean anything in terms of it's price. There are still as many bitcoin to go around as there were before.
If the price of a gallon of milk was 1 satoshi (i.e. 10^-8 Bitcoin) then the price of bitcoin after this decimal point upgrade would also be 10^-8 bitcoin.

Everything from the title of the thread (where the OP claims that nobody holds Yen/Francs in their portfolio as an investment) to the thread where same OP is being screenshotted is stupid.
But feel free to go through it yourself:
A comment says "21 million limit is artificial because it can be removed using software update" (which is a technically correct and fair argument). To which the screenshotted user responds with that argument.

Even 20 years down the road if she suspects that he had these crypto from back then, that it goes into contempt of court for not listing all his assets, and he loses it all.

This guy is seriously so stupid that I don't even know what is he thinking.
Is he saying that adding a decimal place to bitcoin will increase the supply (which is basically cutting a pie into more parts).
Or is he saying that if we were to multiply the number of bitcoins by 10 then we get 10 times more bitcoin (how else would you move a decimal place to the right?), which is a freaking tautological statement. Yeah if we modify the total number of bitcoins to be more, then there will be more bitcoins.

You can put that predicate 'use it properly' in front of anything to make that statement about any medium, whether it's cash, offshore bank accounts, trusts, debt, bank accounts, bearer bonds.
I am just saying, since they are on Television, chances are, he does not have his crypto in secret. Far better option is to cut his losses, pay her NOW and move on (because chances are, she will immediately sell it, but if keep holding, you undertake the risk for her too, and give her much bigger amount of money).

But that's not what the quote is saying at all. The quote is explaining the thinking behind people like you.
Lemme quote the relevant part:


The whole idea is that booms and busts are largely created by the central banks behalf of politicians who because of hostility towards the interest rates and money lending, try to artificially lower the interest rates, and this creates booms, and eventually busts.
This is not about human nature or the infallibility of central banks. If you take a gun and shoot yourself in the foot with it, don't blame 'human body's fragility' as a cause of your bloody foot.

Shorting bitcoin doesn't mean that they are sending spies into your territory and sabotaging your factories from working.
Shorting bitcoin simply means, "I think the price of bitcoin is going to go down by a bit/byte/chunk/lot and I wanna profit from it".
If you had $30 million, based on 2018, one thing you won't do is to just buy and hodl, when you can make more money or safe money by actively trying to predict the price of bitcoin.

So the protocol is decentralized but the network currently is centralized?

I would give shout out to someone who managed to sell their Bitcoin for $40,000

Ah, thanks for clarifying that.

There are a few projects which have formally verified programming languages, but no project with formally verified codebase (only promises).
BTW this would be a good bug which would be caught by formal verification easily:
