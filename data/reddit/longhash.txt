It sounds like mining is not for you.  And yes, your electricity bill will increase dramatically

Very cool story. Keep up the great work!

"Blockchain technology can counter both corporate and government corruption because records and transactions are certificable without the use of a central database, and the data cannot be erased or altered without someone else taking note. Information on a public blockchain is visible and accessible to the public, potentially allowing citizens to see the sources of government funds as well as their destination."

Sorry this happened to you OP.  And thank you for bringing this to light to help serve the community.

Turkish Lira is also performing poorly
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:29:00
How so?

Research, research, and research.  And when you finally think you have an idea, do some more research.

President Nicolas Maduro needs to do a lot more than say the economy has failed.  His people need actions now, not words.

Might have to revisit at the end of the year and see the final numbers for 2018

An experience like the one they went through can make it easier to take that leap of faith into the bitcoin world.
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:34:23
Just another reason why more and more Venezuelans are turning to Bitcoin as a solution to the bolívar crisis.

Back up over $8,000 as of right now

Looks like a very nice design.  Especially liked the Star Wars reference. Best of luck!

Very sorry to hear this happened to you and your family, but glad to hear no one got hurt.
I hope you can find the person who called in with that horrible, bogus threat.  They need to be brought to justice and be held accountable for their actions.
It is a very dangerous situation to put both the innocent people involved AND the police officers responding to what they think could be a nightmare and deadly situation for them.
This swatting thing needs to end.

If it does well in those countries, should be only a matter of time until they bring it too USA.

Marking this for tomorrow

Looks like they updated their article to reflect the bounce back to over $8,000.
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:41:56
Huge, huge potential if this goes through.  Hopefully we can celebrate when it is officially announced.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:11:23
We can certainly agree on that.

Crypto and Bitcoin will save Venezuela.
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:45:58
It will be baby steps at first, but hopefully they will become more and more intrigued by the crypto and blockchain world.

The fees on the ATM are very high.

Found an interesting article on Bloomberg that shares a somewhat similar view as yours:

Pepperoni and Bitcoin seem like a perfect match

We need decentralized journalism

Do we know where this is located?

Keep it going! :)

Not sure that it is a good comparison to compare D3 economy to Bitcoin.  Comparing any video game's economy to Bitcoin is not a good idea. 
In most video games, the reason the game's currency goes down is because over time, less and less people play the game. Which in return, devalues the in-game currency and/or loot.

Its blockchain that is secure and you can trust.  Blockchain is the technology that Bitcoin runs on

Many people have been speculating for years that the dollar will crash.  Previously, people would invest their money into Gold and/or Silver in anticipation of this crash.  Now, more and more people are viewing Bitcoin as the supplement to the dollar.
All I know is, my money is on blockchain.

If Congress could better educate themselves on blockchain and crypto, then it'd be a start.

Wear this at a BTC event and you'll get all the attention.
