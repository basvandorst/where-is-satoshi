"Most of them are far smarter than everybody else, but some of them are really stupid"   What the hell kind of dumb ass point is that?  
On the other hand, the cryptocurrency crowd is made up of about 90% Dunning-Krugers.   Most of *them* think they're smarter than everybody else.

Omg, you're attacking the author instead of the information!   That's called ad hominem and its what people do when they suck at arguing!  People who bash the messenger without refuting his message don't use their brains!  
Oh and by the way, I didn't quote him -- the author of that article did.   And then it was published on "beincrypto.com" the same source you used.  The article you linked was written by an admitted cryptocurrency worshipper lol.  But let's not worry about YOUR source, because he actually agrees with you, right?   Your intellectual dishonesty is bold &amp; loud, but it looks really ugly on you.

 &gt;  creat a culture where bitcoin is actually useful


No, that's called sarcasm, bruh.  My point is that bitcoin can't compete with credit cards on any level at scale - so you worrying about culture is laughable.  You need to be worried about making something that actually works, not culture.   
And you keep talking about "they" like it isn't WE.   Sorry but WE know WE aren't making money - making money isn't the point of credit cards.   It's convenience and security that WE care about, and  that WE are willing to pay for.  It's funny how even in this thread in the bitcoin home subreddit, people are defending credit cards - why?   Because they're easy to use, safe, and reliable and WE are willing to pay for that.   Not because we think we're making money lol.

Not only do you not understand *my* point of view, you don't even  understand your own point of view lol.    Classic Dunning-Kruger, perfect fit for this sub.   You're in the right place dude - keep up the good work.
@_date: 2019-10-08 05:11:09
You *didn't* read that.  
$12 million HKD worth of bitcoin traded in one week - or roughly $1.5 million USD.  In a country with a GDP of $340 billion USD lol.    And most of that was a single trader, buying the dip!
This week, bitcoin volume is "back to normal", well below $1.5 mil per week.      That's pretty solid proof that nobody in Hong Kong wants or uses bitcoin except gamblers.  Why? because gambling is all it's good for.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:18:53
And here's a point you just bailed on lol.    You never answered this question.   What are you going to do, let your whole family die to prove that violence doesn't work on bitcoin?  
You probably would...  but it would only prove me right and you wrong... again lol.
Maybe you can explain how killing me is going to give you access to my bank's lock box?   "First time in human history" lol what a joke.
@_date: 2019-10-12 01:36:10
It's almost like people are willing to pay for the convencience and security that credit cards provide.  Discounts are great but only if I can actually apply them to something other than Tshirts, stickers and beers.  You should creat a culture where bitcoin is actually useful, cost-effective and safe at scale, that's a good way to incentivice people.

I have more understanding of everthing you've said than you do.   All you do is echo what you hear without understanding a word of it, just like everybody else around here.  This sub is well known as the biggest echo-chamber on the internet thanks to people like you.   "You're a dumb troll and I hate you" is where you stupid people always end up, without ever making an actual argument aside from "Federal Reserve!" "Evil Statist Banks!"  "Inflayshun!!" "Muhnipsyulayshun!"  it's pathetic really.

Jesus you're delusional.   Yeah okay, some mobsters threaten to kill your whole family one by one until you give them your bitcoins... and you'll simply refuse &amp; let your family members die, one by one, to prove that violence doesn't work on bitcoin lol - sure bud.  You can do the same thing with a bank lock box.   "First time in history" lol give me a break.   On top of not actually solving any problems, the way you're polluting the planet with your magic sky tokens is violence against humanity.

"Bitcoin doesn't fix anything."
Just because you can't read doesn't mean I didn't make a point.  My point is loud &amp; clear in my very first comment, and you yelling "Federal Reserve!" and "Gubmint Munny is bad mmkay!" hasn't refuted it.  
"Bitcoin doesn't fix anything, and you guys are too afraid to admit it."
It's sad that you missed my point, but you did prove it along the way lol so... good job.
@_date: 2019-10-06 08:55:02


Well that's convenient because it's a fact.  Look at the people who try to live on bitcoin lol.  It's a joke, it's like saying "The people pushing dependency on the current financial power system want you to believe CS:GO skins and pokemons are not better than reliance on them".    
There a thousand ways to prevent confiscation of your wealth that don't involve crypto.  That's not a shortcoming, it's a feature.

"They think they're making money with their credit cards!!" Lmao this guy
I dare you to go to a real subreddit, where they actually know about money and finances and stuff, and make a post asking how many people think they're making money with their credit cards.   Then when they all raise their hands, you can break the news to them that they're all paying an extra 3% and... well in theory they should all burn their credit cards and put their life savings into bitcoin lmao.  Do it, and let's so how that goes.

What a bunch of empty, regurgitated platitudes.  "Sovereign Asset", "worldwide consensus", "Giving people control of their finances", Fix and stabilize markets"... with a nice "Government intervention failed" for good measure... FYI, Bitcoin is/does none of those things.  Like I said, you guys cant admit it.   The best you can do is "This is just the beginning of bitcoin, but someday..."

You fail to grasp that violence can be used to prevent or punish you for using or accessing your crypto, or coerce you into surrendering it.   On top of that, it enables surveillance better than any fiat currency.  Your boy Ross can attest to that.

That makes no sense. If that would cause you to bail on metals entirely it just means you had no idea what you were doing with metals in the first place.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:12:34
LOL so what.  That doesn't mean you know what the hell you're doing.   You obviously don't.  I mean you think cryptos are a store of value lol.   That shows how little you know about "monetary things" in general.  I for one won't be surprized when bitcoin is inevitably surpassed by something better ( like something that actually works lol) and you're left wondering what to do because you obviously don't know what the hell you're doing with cryptos either.  I have over 100,000 posts on facebook about this stuff, and I literally got over 50 likes one time so I obviously know way more than you LMAO
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:02:32
 &gt; It is hard to rebut your comment, as you haven't even formulated an argument.
Actually, you just confirmed my argument.   Gold hasn't been "king" for 5,000 years.    Anybody who owns metals *should* know that silver is more scarce than gold from a usable supply perspective and that it surpassing gold is a very real possibility.  That you don't know that and think the world is upside down if that happens proves what I said - you don't know wtf you're doing with metals.   Silver has surpassed gold before , FYI.   Did the ability of both to store wealth suddenly go up in smoke?  Lol no.

@_date: 2019-05-21 22:31:26
"Inexperienced trader" lol...   nice try bud.   I feel the same safety you do but without the need to hedge my balances for total loss simply because of where they're held.   I know that's your only option to avoid learning \*yet another\* hard lesson, but that doesn't make it any less ridiculous.   I've enjoyed stroking my ego, and now I'll enjoy the safety of my wealth, just like you (but without the fees lmao)
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:19:32
How ironic - you're "hedged" for total loss due to the "counterparty risk" of exit scams, theft and insolvency, not price volatility or true counterparty risk (like a bond issuer defaulting)... But *I'm* the one who doesn't understand the difference between a hedge and insurance LOL!   Another good one buddy
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:16:34
You keep explaining as if I don't understand -- but I get it.   It's fucking ridiculous.  Again, I never said anything aout keeping all your funds on two exchanges.   If you're hedging your trading account balance on the same exchange that you're trading on, you're not mitigating counter-party risk - you're adding to it.  The only way to actually reduce risk is to keep a hedged position on a different exchange.  Go ahead and keep the rest of your funds in COLD STORAGE - that doesn't change my point.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:38:02
Sounds like you're the ignorant one - I can pick it up within minutes, in just about any city in the country.  It's really pretty simple.   Do you need instructions?

You keep acting like it's impossible or something but it isn't lol.  I really will send you instructions if you want - it's really easy - but you need to send money to me, not the other way around.   I mean, I'm the one teaching you new things - I should be the one to get paid here.   You're digging the hole deeper and deeper with every comment.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:28:28
Sure I have - but first of all, that only reduces risk against volatility, not 100% loss like OP.   Unless you're actually hedging for a total loss, in which case you're losing a lot in fees.   Either way, you're not maximizing capital if you have to hedge cash just because it's on an exchange.  I sure as hell don't need to hedge my entire brokerage account just to protect myself from a sim port hack.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:23:04
You're comparing two different things.  No currencies are shutting down for the weekend, USD included.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:07:57
No, I completely understand.


You can't hedge your positions unless you have funds on another exchange.  I never said anything about holding all of your funds on two exchanges.
Hedging your entire trading account balance for total loss due to "counter party risk" is absolutely ridiculous.     If I had to hold leveraged positions in my Schwab account to hedge my entire Fidelity account because I'm afraid Fidelity might exit scam, that would be ridiculous too.  Thank god I don't lol
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:20:14


LOL Holy shit.
Edit: thanks for the downvotes - but if you're hedging your entire trading account balance to protect yourself from a sim card hack...  If your solution to protecting exchange-held funds is to hold funds on *another* exchange, *in leveraged positions*... LOL Holy shit.
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:38:10
I'm not a crypto trader - I don't have to worry about exchange collapses and sim card hacks and such.   I am hedged for calamity, but on a more macro scale - I'm not worried about my personal account balances disappearing into thin air.  It's ironic and honestly kind of ridiculous that the way to reduce risk for exchange-held funds is to hold more funds on another exchange in leveraged positions.   It evokes images of a loaded Vegas craps table.    You nailed it - it's rolling the dice - and I'm not a gambler.
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:00:27

@_date: 2019-05-21 19:38:41
No need to read it again, I completely understand your strategy and it's fucking dumb lol.  Why do you keep on telling me that almost all of your coins are OFF EXCHANGE?   I've acknowledged that fact in pretty much every comment in this thread; it doesn't affect my point.   You don't need to keep telling me that most of your coins are in COLD STORAGE.  The fact that you do proves that you're the one with reading comprehension issues.
I get it dude.  It's a ridiculous strategy.
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:26:35
So you're hedging your positions on the same exchange that you're trading on... to reduce counter-party risk?   LOL okay.    That's not ridiculous, it's fucking stupid.


Not another, a singular. You keep reference funds held on multiple exchanges.
