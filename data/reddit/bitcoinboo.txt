you guys were always a great wallet. Thanks for the headsup and support. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:52:17
this smells funny. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 14:02:17
sweet, I'll be trying this later today

mycelium wallet user here. Will this change have any effect on our current mycelium wallets?
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:33:17
im sorry I guess I missed it. Could you ELI5 on who/what Belle is and how he/she/it fits into this cluster?
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:11:54
Im sorry op, but this has ocurred more times than I care to read on this sub. Did you honestly not research anything? Send to a private wallet, mix, then use. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:51:26
so after reading this thread I'm beginning to get worried. 
Anybody know about trezor accounts as well as electrum wallets? 
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:40:28
perfect, thank you. So she was that moderator in the video. strange. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:09:06
what other exchanges are as large as Coinbase and doing business in the US? Im curious? Circle cant even be close to the volume. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:42:02
Have you thought of putting together a sticky explaing to folks that if they buy from Coinbase they shouldnt go trading large amounts on local bitcoin or their account will be shut down. 
I feel like it happens once a week and somebody comes on here crying that "why did they shut it down"
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:35:26


fair enough.  
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:26:39
I enjoyed the article. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:01:56
well here is the thing, the blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions, everybody can see it :) 
@_date: 2015-06-04 02:26:27
The keys are written down. what makes it safe is the computer never sees the keys, they are displayed on the trezor screen.  
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:11:34
I actually have this as my backdrop

THANK YOU!
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:51:00
sure they did. If that were the case they would have prosecuted him. Since when has the fed not prosecuted a charge which they had full evidence of. Especially on a guy THEY WANTED LOCKED AWAY.
I cant imagine somebody would be so naive so I'm pressed to think your foolishness is sponsored. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 05:49:29

Why does it seem that each time Coinbase is brought up, there seems to be a fair amount of hate, not to mention a quick call to "well circle does it better" argument?
 It would seem that THE ONLY positive news from Coinbase that's been able to help rally the community has been the release of control on the members private keys. However, besides that, it would seem that people really dislike Coinbase.
I'm a new user, I use Coinbase and from day 1 I've just used them as an exchange. It's simple, straight forward and seem reputable, so I'm not sure where all the negativity comes from.

Please note that i've run into this issue utilizing BitWallet on iOS, the 24 word phrase was able to recover the wallet another Bitwallet app, however the signature is unable to properly authorize a transaction. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:26:51
I'll take a stab. 
It means that in that wild west we all play, it's rare to find somebody who "anonymously" recovered $90,000 and publicly announced and then returned the funds. 
I can almost guarantee that if we all came across $90,000, and nobody knew we had it, 90% of the people would shut up and keep it.
 Not to mention he didnt inquire about a reward.

so it's based on public perception/adoption/use? Why do we all joke that good news makes it go down and bad news up, that would be opposite of say Lockhead martin stock price going up because they locked in an order for 32 new Warheads.

So far 90% of my bitcoin transactions have been charitable ones. I really just want to save them but I know i need to use a bit. 
Tor, Mozilla, Wiki, etc are all good places to donate.

thats sad. I'm people and I DO care about what I produce. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:31:51
my understanding was that in order for the 12 word seed to work on other app platforms it needs to utilze the same "word list". From what I had read at one point, Mycelium and Breadwallet used diffeent "word lists" to generate the 12 word seed backup. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:22:15
He deserves a little Trezor flow team sponsorship for the publicity it got. NOt required, but would be a nice touch.

I decided to being using change tip. I just now processed two separate deposits into my changtip account. I show at least 3 confirmations for each of the transactions yet my change tip account reflects a 0 balance. Changetip claims it waits for 2 block confirmations.

@_date: 2014-11-12 18:28:31
Fair enough. The last few months have been monthly $100 swings that initially had me freaked out. Now I just go, meh, I guess we'll see what happens. 
After I bought at 615 and it dropped the next month to 400, I was pretty discouraged, but since i was told to HODL, thats what I'll be doing, with just a bit of changetip and small transactions and donations here and there. 
Your UN is encouraging.

@_date: 2015-05-10 19:01:45
I agree, however I had issues restoring the key onetime and it scared me away. A future update ended up fixing it.

most phone bitcoin apps allow you to save the seed, so if you lose your phone you can just restore it. ex: mycellium or bread. So I dont think yo should ONLY keep "snack" money. Keep a couple hundred bucks and save the seed in 3 separate places and with family. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:05:20
are they counting the cash wallet and bitcoin wallets under your same account as multiples?
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:53:49
earned is different than received. In this case a tip is received, so you are not waiting around guessing if there is anything to collect.

what they told me was that they still initialize the transaction from your savings/chekcing however if that ACH fails THEN and ONLY THEN does your credit card get charged. If the ACH goes through there will never be any credit or debit charge showing up.

just dont carry your trezor with you. the cops will confiscate it and not give it back, since you are advertizing that you have something they can seize with little purview.

@_date: 2015-01-28 22:11:53
Here is what they stated and it follows suit with major pharma needing to charge huge amounts to recover FDA testing, trials, approvals etc etc etc


or this


Eventually we will have options that are cheaper or perhaps just a low support minimalistic option, but as you said that will only come with scale and SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES in Quantity demand. 
why am I telling you this for, you seem to already understand. Plus my supply chain management background in commercial aerospace probably doesnt lend itself too well to another tech industry dealing with small electronic components with high reliability needs and short lead times.

State vs Federal. States are allowed to make their own laws, but the Fed's rarely actually respect it and traditionally will interject. The USA has a deep deep love with the war on drugs and the amount of funding/ asset forfeiture gained from it.

-Open the Notification Center by swiping down from the top of the screen
-If you’re not in the Today view, tap on the “Today” tab.
-Scroll way down to the bottom of the NC.
-If there are any new Notification center widgets available, you should see a (X) New Widget Available. X being the number of new widgets that are available to download/install. 
-Tap on this to get to the Widgets section of Notification Center.

the wallet is ON your phone. If you wipe the phone, that instance of the wallet is hidden/gone UP UNTIL you use your "seed" to load your wallet on another piece of hardware (phone or computer based wallet)
I store my seed/recovery phrase in three separate locations.  THAT phrase/seed IS YOUR OWNERSHIP, DONT SHARE IT, DONT EMAIL IT, DONT TYPE IT INTO A BROWSER TO CHECK IT. STORE IT.

Well now I feel like a fool, because I wasn't able to find that helpful page when I was searching. it clearly spells it out in that link. 
So if somebody goes to:  and searches for it, how do they find it? 
Here are areas I checked for the info:
1. **Products** At the top of the page, yet the "USD Wallet" is not listed as a product.  
2. **Resources** Here we have (What is bitcoin; buy bitcoin;**HELP**; Charts;Blog;Security;Global;**About Coinbase**; Status)
Now I would have thought that it would be under Products, Buy Bitcoin, Help, or perhaps About Coinbase, but I couldnt find it. So then I started trying cntrl + F USD WALLET on every page adn I could not find anything about transaction time. 
Like I said, apparently it's all there and I just couldnt find it. I'll chalk it up to my poor searching skills. 
Suggestions "Notice- the transaction you are about to process will require pre-aproval and does not qualify for Instant transfer" 
Or perhaps Something on the actual USD WALLET Deposite page that tells you "**All deposits will take 4 business days**" 
maybe Im just expecting too much. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:04:19
I laughed pretty hard. Thanks OP. I had similar feelings too when I bought.

do it. Now a days in the bitcoin sub I dont ask, I just give. but in others subs, either because of rules or to be polite I normally ask a person if they would appreciate a tip in bitcoin for their comment, and most the time they are appreciative. Only a few times have I had some person complaining about how "changetip is only used to boast about your gift" CHILL OUT BRO ITS REDDIT.
also I would advice you to at least tip $.25 each time. I feel embarrassed when I see tips worth $.04. 
just the tip
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:41:52
I hope the trend continues...

Now if you consider that 90% of drug related offenses are Cannabis related, the largest player to gain traction from decriminalization and legalization is really Cannabis.

yeah, no. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:42:36
It's a risky investment but I dont consider it gambling (gaming). 
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:55:25
i laughed
@_date: 2015-02-17 19:28:30
oh sad :( I just ordered two last week on wednesday. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:08:03
Folks, this guy needs help setting up a DDOS network. Im sure it's totally harmless. 
Search ESEA bitcoin scandal. That was a good one. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:18:58
happens to me with 100% of transactions
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:13:36
Got it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:13:41
so how long did it take you?
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:20:40
what does Level 3 verification entail, above the instant buy verification level?
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:05:10
why would you need to report any personal purchases made on Overstock.com. 
Edit: HOLLY SHIT. Why have I never seen before that every single freaking satoshi spent needs to be reporting in your taxes. that is such a pain in the ass. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:53:20
Wait, what is Bitcoind? is that just a typo or a new startup?
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:36:07
what a scumbag. Can anybody ELI5 if there is any real benefit to handing out all that money to the worlds central banks?
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:25:54
 I would google more. The fact that you are even asking this question is a bit sketchy. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:14:52
Hopefully it's still around for my next visit to the city. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:06:22
ooops I totally forgot to say thanks properly. 
lots of bits
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:45:30
yes, agreed. Next I'll begin learning more about the block chain, m of n multi sig stuff, sidechains etc. I dont spend much BTC but i am one of the generous tippers on here, so hopefully that is helping a bit in the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:32:44
to be clear 1k is MAYBE a studio MAYBE with a kitchen in a BAD part of town. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:24:11
you could try circle
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:45:57
I see what you are doing there. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:23:12
are you saying you can predict the price and the next 6 months are nothing but losses? What happens after 6 months, complete loss of use?
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:43:55
thanks. I dont gamble $ either. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:48:44
yeah, I have a few wallets i can spread it out to while I reformat and resetup. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:53:54
you've been buying coins all year (2014) and kept them in there without exporting to a paper wallet or cold storage? We have a few stories around these parts about folks that do this. good luck and im sorry you learned an expensive lesson. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:16:50
restoring a bitwallet  wallet to a bitwallet wallet with the seed. The seed was correct. the wallet had a glitch that was later fixed behind the scenes, becuase one day I just tried it for the 100th time and it worked.
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:57:02
I literally just found that thread after my freakout. I think I might be able to figure it out. I just dont know what form to use. My only "bitcoin sales"/purchases have been to non profits, total MAYBE $100 total. 
Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses.
Form 4797, Sales of Business Property.
Form 8824, Like-Kind Exchanges.
Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets.

oh man a Honey Badger Screen would have been my choice. 
Honey Badger dont give a $4it
@_date: 2015-02-11 17:50:47


Welp there is one weakness in your plan. Are you seriously storing your seed plain text in a google drive?
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:54:37
me too :) thanks for the support link. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:31:31

@_date: 2015-02-25 19:20:43
oh man. sorry to hear. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:20:12
i just facepalm my soul after seeing your comment o_O go figure. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:36:14

Lots of Bits
thanks for the detailed post. I wont get into details because as you said there is no reason to divulge everything. 
thanks for the info regarding bank accounts, exchanges and planning ahead. that was very beneficial and i'm already partially there. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:08:58
just the tip
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:19:05
encypted paper wallets printed out with m of n signatures needed. Stuff away
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:42:09
nobody's hating. good working saving for that 2.1!
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:12:41
Thats what I figured. Why couldn't customer service just give me that answer? I spent 10 minutes in chat trying to ask it different ways. oh well. I guess I wait till tuesday. 
Does anybody know if Coinbase describes this anywhere? I looked and could not find it. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:28:20
this is great. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:06:05
I do. I use some to donate on a regular basis to Wiki, Tor, MOzilla, EFF, ETC in addition to changetip. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:05:12
Thanks Dude. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:30:32
i've already been trying that, but I'm trying to be mindful of not being annoying. So if Im asked I speak about it and I might bring it up once or twice but then drop it. 
I have tried to get a couple friends to get into it by given them a few satoshi's but they just didnt feel interested in it.So instead I try and tip regularly throughout the week. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:03:41
Much *trabajo, poco dinero. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:00:08
lots of people. You haul we give it
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:13:35
well they work for us, just no applied to the Corps that ultimately fund them into law, oversight or regulation. Just dont pay your child support, alimony or taxes and see what happens. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:40:10
ok, I guess I look at it differently. Thanks for explaining. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:25:39
funny enough, I wish I could just cancle my order and just buy instant again like I have been. Then again If they had a FAQ regarding how it worked I would have seen this before putting the order in. My fault for thinking it would work the same. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:10:08
yeah, I hope so. My first btc was at 660 :( and they've just been avg'd down since then. Im keeping the faith...
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:39:52
and now I have a new background. thanks OP
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:20:33
Just the tip
wow, thanks. I havent done any rasp work for over a year so i'll have to refresh and then come back to this tutorial. Thanks for laying it out Sir. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:44:49
I like the way you think. Hopefully we begin seeing more adoption. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:08:30
he's doing it wrong and tryin to restore a wallet instead of create a new wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:14:58
do you know which wallets support this? would we just then use our main electrum wallet (windows hdd) to watcht he addresses via a MPK import? 
@_date: 2015-02-24 17:11:03
just the tip
does it work any different with windows? thanks Bash
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:43:06
oh man. well you arent alone, so dont feel too bad. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:35:52
unless they total 14k. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:21:04
oops I was wrong. It's been saying since last week that 


i just looked very quickly and assumed it was malware it was freaking out over.
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:41:16
i feel like I saw $20 tipped a few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:20:03
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:39:13
ahahah I was just going to pst a thread about me doing the exact same thing. YOu can actually take the foam insert from the box and it will fit inside the altoids container perfectly. then its protected a bit and snug. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:59:48
i'll tell you one thing I learned about bitcoin today. YOU NEED TO KEEP TRACK of 100% OF YOUR PURCHASES. Yay tax time is going to be fun. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:18:16
it will just chose one or several, IIRC. NO big deal. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:51:36

-Just got a trezor this week and I had a few questions. 
Lets say i want to keep a trezor address handy for future deposit, while the trezor is disconnected, what is the best way?
-Is it as simple as visiting mytrezor.com while it's synced and copying one of the receive addresses to my desktop and closing it all down? Can I do that?
-Am I able to add a passphrase post seed creation without creating a new wallet?
-If I create a second account on the same trezor seed what is it used for/purpose? 
thank you  
 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:09:31
i upvoted you but i'm still a bit creeped out. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:31:41

convertible virtual currency,
or the use of convertible
virtual currency to pay for goods or services
in a real-world economy transaction, has
tax consequences that may result in a tax lia
bility. 
Its in there. Plus the supplemental forms. Any exchange of bitcoin for goods or services must be reported since it's treated as property

im so confused.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:58:04
im being downvoted, so it must be a bad thing?
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:21:21

@_date: 2015-02-10 20:04:19
Totally off topic but does anybody know when they will implement a Pin or PW in order to open the wallet? I had heard they were working on it.
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:19:44
you got it, thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:50:59
He's right guys. I dont see why anybody is arguing. Thanks ctfnoob
i'd tip ya but i know you dont like bitcoin. I wouldnt want to insult you.

@_date: 2015-02-09 16:40:34
dont cold storage all of it. Download a smart phone wallet (bread wallert, mycelium, etc) and then use that as your petty cash spending account. Load up say $100 in B on the phone and put the rest on the trezor or in CS. 
Correct me if im wrong but I believe they would still mine the blocks (process transactions) for the transaction satoshis but would no longer receive the block award. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:54:30






I wish I was creative. Im sure you guys will come up with some cool stuff. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:01:29
did you know that you can now have that image as your trezor startup homepage? Just saying.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:42:30
NONE. NOT A SINGLE ONE
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:37:58
Thankyou for that detailed explanation. I will keep that in mind when considering further purchases.  
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:10:58
thanks for the help. I guess I need to transfer, wipe and then resetup with a passphrase.

what is the "grand exchange"? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:47:59
I dont look at gambling as an investment. I dont look at investments that are inherently risky as betting. I look at gambling as GAMING.  YOu can call it semantics but it's just how I chose to see it. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:23:02
they cant cook cannabis in the lab. That would be up to farmers and growers. Not their wheelhouse.
remember that a majority of what they are protecting is the fight on cannabis since it's really making up 90% of the drug related offenses. HUGE MONEY keeping that shit on lockdown.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:58:43
i just saw the video they put out with greenbits on that mobile secure wallet that operates off the OS or something like that.
