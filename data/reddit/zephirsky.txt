Same way Coinbase's mobile app can be used (indicated in the infographic). Moreover, not only for tokens, but for collectibles, which is pretty popular asset among some holders.
Before critisizing something you should learn more about what you're criticizing..

There is a clear statement: for different purposes. Coinbase is great for everyday use, while holding more coins may be better on some other ones

Thanks, it took some time to research and even more to design it so it is more than nice to see someone likes it :)

Believe it or not, we're not associated with any of these sites, most likely they don't even know about it. Just how could we make such infographic without proofs links? 
Obviously, some of those things won't be purchased by any of us (like yacht and space flight), but look at the guy in comments who says he lives near the cafe in Praha. It will be super-cool if he go there after seeing this infographic as that will mean we all can make Bitcoin go beyond internet. :)
However, thanks for checking it out!

You've done a great job so far. 
Consider expanding it to a real bitcoin casino as there is definitely decent demand for it nowadays.
1. Since you already have some code to start off you can base more games (like dice, minesweeper etc) on it.
2. Test it for bugs as it deals with players' money and it is important to provide maximum safety.
3. Also it is definitely a good idea to add chat to boost social aspect, which can be relatively easy implemented with custom HTML5 or any ready-made free solution from github.
4. Tell about your website on thematic (bitcoin/gambling) forums to attract more players who seek something new.
5. Once your website has stable work and clean reputation it can be highlighted on some of the [top bitcoin casinos listings]( which will bring more regular players.
Hope these tips make any sense. Good luck with it!
