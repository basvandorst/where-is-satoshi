Just a cursory inspection shows that 'Weiss' has already been prosecuted for fraudulent, misleading statements, as well as engaging in insider pump &amp; dumps though their listings:
and more with the SEC
"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against a registered investment adviser and its owner for allegedly engaging in self-dealing and failing to disclose material facts to clients regarding conflicts of interest, use of investor funds, and the risks of the investments they recommended."
the SEC alleges that Family Endowment Partners LP and its owner, Lee Dana Weiss, of Newton, Massachusetts, urged their clients to invest more than $40 million in illiquid securities issued by several related companies without disclosing that Weiss had an ownership interest in the parent company of these entities and received payments from these entities.
In the latter docket, we discover that Weiss also has a history of simply displaying 'ratings' based on random employee 'picks', to wit, employees holding absolutely *zero* experience in the markets they claim to 'rate', whilst misrepresenting themselves as 'experts'.
*"In reality, Edelson was not actually involved in selecting the specific recommendations during a portion of the relevant time period. The recommended trades were selected without Edelson’s knowledge by other Weiss Research employees with little or no specific experience in the particular markets at issue."*
*"Weiss Research, in advertisements and other materials drafted by Martin Weiss and Edelson, made claims about the profitability and past performance of its premium service publications that were inconsistent with the premium services’ overall performance; and made false statements that mischaracterized Edelson’s involvement in selecting the recommended investments. "*
TLDR: Weiss ratings is a long standing pump &amp; dump operation who makes propitious picks based largely on which securities the owners currently hold, and who, prima facia, had a few years of *self-proclaimed* legitimacy, yet were later exposed as shilling their own picks to pump their stocks.

SEC Cyber Unit begins freezing ICO assets
Today at 03:41:57 PM
Reply with quote  Edit message  Delete message  
Washington D.C., Dec. 4, 2017 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced it obtained an emergency asset freeze to halt a fast-moving Initial Coin Offering (ICO) fraud that raised up to $15 million from thousands of investors since August by falsely promising a 13-fold profit in less than a month.
The SEC filed charges against a recidivist Quebec securities law violator, Dominic Lacroix, and his company, PlexCorps. The Commission's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Lacroix and PlexCorps marketed and sold securities called PlexCoin on the internet to investors in the U.S. and elsewhere, claiming that investments in PlexCoin would yield a 1,354 percent profit in less than 29 days. The SEC also charged Lacroix's partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer, in connection with the scheme.
Today's charges are the first filed by the SEC's new Cyber Unit. The unit was created in September to focus the Enforcement Division's cyber-related expertise on misconduct involving distributed ledger technology and initial coin offerings, the spread of false information through electronic and social media, hacking and threats to trading platforms.
The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy issued an Investor Alert in August 2017 warning investors about scams of companies claiming to be engaging in initial coin offerings:

*How the fuck is ethereum responsible for someone promising excessive returns to catch greedy shits offguard?*
Are you retarded or simply insipid?
Ethereum Foundation formed a NON-PROFIT corporation to illegally SELL securities to 'greedy shits' by spuriously using a non-profit status to **sell** 60 million tokens, setting the precedent for their entire blockchain to be used as an ICO spewing machine. 
'Ethereum Foundation' is a corporation in Switzerland and was in fact founded by over half US citizens. Why would US citizens feel the need to form a non-profit Swiss Corporation to launch their product, sell their tokens, and to evade Tax &amp; Securities laws through a non-profit entity to issue a coin on the promise of profit? It's a running joke at this point. The Ethereum Devs got filthy rich through their own ICO scam.

**A stiftung foundation exists to give effect to the stated, non-commercial wishes of its founder....Stiftung are purely not for profit enterprises and commercial activities are generally not permitted to be conducted by them.**
The Ethereum Premine:
As mentioned, Ethereum propogated a 72 million coin premine before its official launch. Out of those coins, 60 million were 'sold' in an ICO, the rest were pocketed by Vitalik and the Ethereum foundation, which they freely admit, and is viewable on their blockchain:
Your little rant is attenuous at best. I know all you're worried about is 'ma portfolio' returns by promoting your ponzi ICO scams. 
Ethereum was unaminously declared a scam by the community when it launched, with an unprecedented 80% premine putting all of it's tokens into the hands of private parties. It's tokens were promoted solely on the promise of future profit by a centralized corporation, which hands down passes the Howie Test as a security. 
I'm not here to argue semantics with ponzi promoting newbs. The apodictic nature of the Ethereum ICO being a centralized security is beyond settled. 
You make zero argumentation in some lame attempt to shift blame; you're fueled by irrational mania and are attempting to prop up a deplorable ponzi. 
If rootstock ends up allowing ICO launches on the bitcoin network, the companies that promote these ICO ponzi's will have the same problems on their hand. I hope to God that there are measures in place to prevent ICO launches via Bitcoin.

That's a red herring, or an Ignoratio Elenchi fallacy.
Cryptocurrency &amp; ICO'S are not 'guns'.
In general, the ignoratio elenchi occurs when an argument purporting to establish a specific conclusion is directed, instead, to proving a different conclusion. This version is often termed the red herring fallacy—an irrelevant subject is interjected into the conversation to divert attention away from the main issue.

This is also a real good way to open yourself up to a Civil Tort for Damages. This is blatant misrepresentation, and anyone that relies on this and loses money in the process is going to have a field day in court with this clown.
*An assertion or manifestation by words or conduct that is not in accord with the facts.*
*Misrepresentation is a tort, or a civil wrong. This means that a misrepresentation can create civil liability if it results in a pecuniary loss. For example, assume that a real estate speculator owns swampland but advertises it as valuable commercially zoned land. This is a misrepresentation. If someone buys the land relying on the speculator's statement that it is commercially valuable, the buyer may sue the speculator for monetary losses resulting from the purchase.*

I not sure you understand the nuances of commercial Law. This is not a private transaction, he is putting himself within the jurisdiction of not only the United States, but whatever country he is promoting his products to. It's called the minimal contacts rule, and it grants subject matter &amp; personal jurisdiction to any forum that the party in question is doing business in. 
Commercial Law is internationally enforced, it's not as 'wild' as many of you would like to think. 
Of course, you could always ask BTCE how doing business with US citizens worked out for them. 
It's called 'minimal contacts'

Unfortunately no. That's what called an unconscionable adhesion contract, and if the terms are so lopsided it creates an unfair disadvantage to one party, the clause if unenforceable.
If I copy pasta a contract with 'fine print' that says it's perfectly acceptable for me to steal your money, when the *implication* and *overall* understanding of the agreement implies *something contrary*, especially one in which a party is tricked, and would be utterly unfair/unconscionable to one of the parties, it is unenforceable. 
There are many nuances in Law, and these people that think trickery is going to win out in the long run, often find out the hard way.
The funny thing about Law, it has a way of balancing the scales if used properly.

That article sites 'coindesk' as a reference, and doesn't link to a single SEC statement. 
This article is factually incorrect, Secretary Clayton was specifically asked about Ethereum at the Senate hearing, and gave the *same* answer as the preceding questions: ICO coins, regardless of whether they are called 'utility tokens', e.g. *GAS*, are securities. Thus, since not a single ICO coin has legally issued their tokens, they are unregistered, ergo illegal security offerings.

I have a ledger, I agree it's confusing. 
Upon startup you are asked which bitcoin chain you'd like to use (Bitcoin or Bcash, implying there are 2 bitcoins).
To be fair, the part you are referring to about segwit, is because the wallet gives you the option to create a legacy or segwit address on the bitcoin (BTC) chain. (This part has nothing to do with Bcash, it's just asking if you want to create an 'old' bitcoin address or a 'new' segwit address, but this step comes after selecting between Bitcoin &amp; Bcash)
I agree it should be setup better, it is confusing for newbs.

**2) the jargon they use ("universes", superlatives, neologisms etc..**
This is essentially how they evade criticisms of the 72,000,000 premine, the mutability, the hacks, being an unregistered security, the centralization, being unable to handle ICO or Kitty launches, et al; it's quite literally by employing nonsensical technical sounding jargon they've invented to dazzle the credulous.
Ethereum in a nutshell:
*Argument By Prestigious Jargon:*
Using big complicated words so that you will seem to be an expert. Why do people use "utilize" when they could utilize "use" ?
For example, crackpots used to claim they had a Unified Field Theory (after Einstein). Then the word Quantum was popular. Lately it seems to be Zero Point Fields.
*Argument By Gibberish (Bafflement):*
This is the extreme version of Argument By Prestigious Jargon. An invented vocabulary helps the effect, and some net.kooks use lots of CAPitaLIZation. However, perfectly ordinary words can be used to baffle. For example, "Omniscience is greater than omnipotence, and the difference is two. Omnipotence plus two equals omniscience. META = 2." [From R. Buckminster Fuller's No More Secondhand God.]
Gibberish may come from people who can't find meaning in technical jargon, so they think they should copy style instead of meaning. It can also be a "snow job", AKA "baffle them with BS", by someone actually familiar with the jargon. Or it could be Argument By Poetic Language.
An example of poetic gibberish: *"Each autonomous individual emerges holographically within egoless ontological consciousness as a non-dimensional geometric point within the transcendental thought-wave matrix."*

The SEC again reiterated in the Senate hearing that Ethereum (and every ICO to date) was an illegal, unregistered security offering in violation of the 1933, 34 Securities &amp; Exchange Acts, and that simply calling something a 'utility token' (gas) doesn't magically get around corporate securities laws.
Now, they'd like to go 'Proof of Stake', so that majority share (gas) holders get *preferred voting rights* in their network, following the exact model a corporation uses to 'vote' by amount of shares held. I'm sure the government is going to *love* this one as well.
Perhaps they are attempting to enter the Guinness book of records for amount of corporate law violations by a crypto entity in a single sitting. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:56:37
Ethereum issued it's tokens to US citizens, that's all the SEC needed to gain jurisdiction. They also mentioned that exchanges trading in these mock securities are acting as unregistered securities brokers and could likely face penalties. 
At the very least they could obtain an injunction for any exchange doing business with US citizens to remove these tokens from its platform. It's a dangerous game at this point.
