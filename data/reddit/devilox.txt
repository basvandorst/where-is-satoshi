Take care man, a good practice would be if you would create a new segwit wallet. Backup your private key on a paper, never keep those words online 
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:31:01
it's ok. i installed that shitty wallet fast and guide him :P . he will restore the funds in a electrum wallet. next step would be to drop some guides about keeping the private key safer. remember you will probably need to move the funds from that wallet

no, a block can be valid only with the coinbase transaction

not when you play your savings on that very nice and shinny spinner
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:21:15
nop, i read that "paper" and the only interesting thing is a story about "satoshi" and Hal debugging some early versions. everything in there is already on the internet. unfortunatly, Hal can't deny or confirm

well, im still trying but, i tried everything, messing around with multiple choices at the first 2 questions and nothing :(

@_date: 2019-04-05 13:59:39

transaction fees
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:15:26
because the last block was mined 30 mins ago, in the same time you send the transaction 
you must wait 2-3 blocks before the 1st confirmation

hmm i don't think it's possible yet because the one that receive a tip must open a channel with the bot lightning network(or other networks that have a channel opened with the bot lightning network) in order to claim the tip.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:33:52
you can try coingate, they have default bitcoin payment + altcoins using shapeshift i think.

 some screnshots from the app
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:48:58
you need to install it, create a new wallet, backup your seeds, send a small amount to the the newly created wallet, then open a channel and enjoy
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:34:59
i have a question about lightning, hope you guys will help me.
for example i have to receive 500 000 sat from bob
i have opened a few channels with 50 000 capacity with nodes that have few millions
in this case bob could send me those 500k sats ? or i need to have channels opened with minimum the amount i should receive?
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:04:58

@_date: 2018-04-09 10:51:08
nop, it's correct. 
 1 millisatoshi = 0.00000000001 BTC
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:24:19
it's not working on centos...
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:39:47
Its part of the qa, this happend before they sit up and leave, which is included in the video
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:24:25
guess who's censoring the QA part where vitalik owned "satoshi"

@_date: 2018-04-30 17:07:13

@_date: 2018-04-07 23:22:13

@_date: 2018-04-09 08:23:21
hello. i've created an online shop based only for lightning payment trying to prove that btc can save babies. take a look here. cheers 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:58:23
sorry what? what's the rush ? you want to buy something from someone who accept lightning payments?
