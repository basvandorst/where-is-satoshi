They're pre-packaged medication tablets, not powder. I know its more expensive than a lot of wholesale powder deals, so shop smart. It's not really any more superior, just its more convenient for some.

You need javascript enabled. 
I've had a few requests for the choline (CDP-Choline/Alpha GPC) and will look at stocking it soon. L-Theanine maybe too.
We do not ship from the US, we ship from where these products are made in India.

We're legit. 
No reviews yet, but we just gave away a bunch of free packs and I know a few said they were going to do reviews, so hopefully there will be some soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:04:25
Indeed. 
You may find this interesting though, have a read of it 
We stock the same stuff.

Coincidentally I was checking our ranking on Google then I thought I might just search on Reddit... Saw this here so I figured I'd reply :-)

No retailer (in this niche) I know of carries QC/COA's for their products (MyModafinil, Modup etc). 
Gwern has some examples in the article on modafinil [here]( The modafinil, armodafinil and atomoxetine are from Sun Pharma, selegiline from INTAS Pharma, tianeptine from Serdia. piracetam from Micro B&amp;B.
I've personally tried the modafinil, armodafinil, selegiline and piracetam with clear results (obviously not all together).

Yeah, you should use piracetam with some choline for optimal results. I mean, you should really be able to get your choline via diet alone but if you start getting headaches with the piracetam then definitely add in some choline. 
I would recommend CDP-Choline or alpha GPC. These two are slightly more expensive, but are a lot better than choline bitartrate and CDP assists in dopamine receptor regulation. Depending on where you are, most places stock CDP-Choline and alpha-GPC. 
And thanks for offering to do a review. 
This is a good breakdown of it 
And also, and @_date: 2013-04-27 23:53:22
Agree entirely, it isn't really a nootropic. Neither is tianeptine. 
But, they're interesting drugs and definitely have some uses. I know a few people into nootropics who have been after atomoxetine, and we carry it for those who want it. Same goes for tianeptine. 
It's classed under stimulant &gt; adrenergic, which may have some benefit to those seeking "nootropics". For comparison, modafinil is classed under the stimulant &gt; eugeroics category.
Atomoxetine a true nootropic? I don't believe so. Some uses for those wanting to study? Sure. 
I don't want to turn this into nootropic category bashing thread either :-)
