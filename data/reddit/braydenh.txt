Do you want a few arguments against BitCoin to pad out this list a bit?
* Offers no consumer protection
* There's massive risk of consolidation due to lack of reward for node operators
* Network is relatively cheap to attack, e.g. flooding with transactions
* Confirmation times are too slow
* Major risk of consolidation of hashing power, making it easy for someone to make short term gains by abusing the network
* The requirements for the average person to be secure are obscene
* The community is completely inflexible to change, hindering any potential enhancements since there is no option for a graceful upgrade
* No protection in the event of fraud or theft
* Crazy community which makes Scientologists look normal
But I'm sure paying slightly lower fees makes BitCoin worth the hassle.
I could add more to the list but who cares about BitCoin anymore? It's not worth the effort.

If that's the case, why is cojoco there? He basically never posts about Bitcoins and only owns due to some stupid Reddit rules with regards to inactive subreddit owners.
Look at his comment history, there's nothing about bitcoin and when he does post in it's only to tell people they're shadowbanned.

I can usually get inter-bank transfers from ANZ to Bankwest to go same-day, and from looking at CBA's website they say it is usually handled NBD. (  ). I think 2-3 days is a bit unrealistic.
Good part about those transfers too is you get this fancy thing called fraud protection. Bitcoin doesn't seem to bother with such overheads.

I Googled a bit of the code and found a Pastebin from yesterday with a slightly different version of this script:

No, if you read the paragraph that came from they said that any 'payment' and 'transfer' related services may be a candidate for reform with technologies based on Bitcoin - not necessarily Bitcoin itself. As well they didn't say it is efficient, they said **IF** it is more efficient.
That section too is like one of the only positive bits on Bitcoin too, the rest paints a sad picture for Bitcoiners.
Like this:




There's a lot more in there and it is an interesting read, it talks about mining consolidation and the issue that there are so many intermediaries with Bitcoin now. (e.g. Coinbase)
Recommended read for Bitcoin zealots, please try not to make fake positive pieces out of it like the OP has.

He did disclose the issue privately with them and gave them time to deal with it but was fobbed off with unhelpful responses which made it seem like absolutely nothing was happening.
I don't blame him for what he did, Blockchain clients deserve to know when a security issue is poorly handled. Quite a lot of money is at stake for some people.

That API is amazing, it returns a price in pennies!
So say it attempts to represent $615.32 USD, it'll return 61532 as the price. Rather than a float that is 615.32.

I don't think Reddit being a bit slow at times is really going to make ChangeTip die any faster. Their business model would remain completely unsustainable even if Reddit was smart enough to use web sockets for mentions and didn't have API limits on posting.
@_date: 2015-05-07 02:43:35
ChangeTip has been paying people for ages to tip to try and "spread awareness". In fact in the past they have admitted this, and this is against the Reddit rules on self promotion:


They also have a penchant for ban evasion, multiple staff members have been banned at least once for various things like this. Charles especially burns through Reddit accounts like crazy.
I don't understand why the admins are being so lenient on them. They are obviously breaking the rules, they are obviously ban evading and they're obviously in general horrible people for how they exploit tragedy. (Though I know the admins won't care about the last part)
In addition they took a service which existed previously (bitcoin tipping) and did not require a website or anything like that, and built a service around it so that you can give them all your information in a nice, centralised and monitored fashion. When they become bankrupt (no, not if), they will sell your user data which can say, link your Facebook account to your Twitter account and your Reddit account, if you have those registered to the one ChangeTip account.
It would not be tooooo bad I suppose if they weren't already leaking your data like a damn firehose, prior to a change (which was only forced by the fact I had to tell them this was going on for them to do anything), it would give all your user data as part of the request. It still does this in fact, it provides anyone listening to tip events your: username, location, preferred currency, biography, profile picture, ChangeTip unique identifier (useful for linking social networking accounts!) and some other stuff. The only way to prevent this is to tick a magic checkbox who's purpose is not entirely obvious.
They made a blog post about this too and lied by saying the only issue was profile pictures (so they're also lying scumbags), never mentioned about the part where people could collect your personal details but I'm sure nobody is that horrible.
Oh wait... 
I can't believe you zealots actually defend these people, especially now they have a literal paid shill in this subreddit's mod team. It's just mind bogglingly stupid.

It's a type of ban where the person can still post but it has to be approved by a moderator. In addition they cannot vote. The votes and comments appear to work on their end but in reality nobody is seeing these changes.
It's designed to make it more difficult for spam bots to detect if they're banned.

Did they share pamphlets on e-mail? When people were talking about the internet in the '90s did they hand out AOL 500 hours CDs to all their family?
It's a whole different situation when you bring money into it, people get self conscious and start to make assumptions on how you value them. Maybe talk about Bitcoin later but don't come fully loaded with paper wallets and a pre prepared speech.
That kind of proselytizing reeks of pyramid schemes (or religion?) to most people.
@_date: 2015-07-31 09:58:01
A lot more than are working on Bit Coin development at present.
Just look at immensely complex e-mail/productivity suites like Exchange, I bet it's more than a few people working from home.
The amount of Bit Coin core developers is probably closer to the amount of engineers who make products for digitising faxes.

Hello Mr Jerky,
Yes limited partnerships are generally easier, I know with sole trader ones you can pretty much get them all online as long as you know your tax file number. Accounting is going to be fun too, tax time is coming up and accounting for bitcoin sales is going to really make your accountant earn their fees. I hope yours' doesn't charge hourly.
Just checked on your website and I don't see any mention of whether the prices are GST inclusive, to be honest I'm not sure whether that's required but you should probably mention it. Especially if people overseas want any shipped to them (not sure how practical that is), since you would not be charging international clients GST.
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:03:32


Eh I don't know, that seems to match up with the current state of most Bitcoin "savers" pretty well.
@_date: 2015-04-13 03:25:38
Just looking at your website, you don't appear to have an ABN anywhere. I searched the business.gov.au website and found this under your names,  as a limited partnership with OCD Jerky associated however you refer to OCD Jerky as OCD Jerky Pty Ltd on the contact page, which implies the company itself is registered.
It's interesting that in March you disassociated that entity name from your registration too and just changed it to "Behzad Javaheri-Rad and Randell Tomini".
Also under your contact information, it only has a bunch of mobile numbers and your little location widget just says you're in Perth.
I found some more details on the whois which says Randall, who according to the contact page is one of the directors, is in Applecross (right next to the ocean too, nice spot!). 
The contact details on the site have an address which points to some warehouse-like thing in Kardinya, is that where you guys do production?
(By the way you should really change that contact page thing, it took me ages to notice because the off-white on brown does not stand out at all)
This isn't to say it isn't legitimate, it's just a bit of a finer detail problem and it's worth doing due diligence and checking these things. Especially if people are going to pay for products via an irreversible payment mechanism!
I notice you have a .com.au registered to Randall, you should really use that instead since it lends more credibility, since you need an ABN to register one.
Sorry the post seems a bit all over the place but I wrote it piecemeal over an hour.

I don't really know Perl well enough to critique it that badly unfortunately but I did see some weird shit that could probably be messed with.
    exec( '/bin/cat', $fn ) or error("couldn't find cat or the file: $!");
Where fn is coming from the database so far as I can tell, with very little validation. If someone compromised your database, they could say.. make a video: "xxx_hot_karpeles_xxx.mp4; cat /etc/passwd" or something like that, or drop in a shell.
DCoin is also a PHP crypto currency,

Except they're waterproof, extremely durable and even if you write Bitcoin rubbish all over them, they're still legal tender (and you can probably clean that mess off pretty easily).

Having picked line by line through the majority of the code for "porn site in a can", all I can say is, "wow".
It's really the most strangely developed thing. I even passed it onto master Perl expert who sat there and complained for 10 minutes about the stylistic choices.
Initially it seems a bit dumb since you claim this can run on shared hosting yet you use things like:
     system 'cp', '-f', $thumb_fn, "/mnt/site/public_html/thumbs/$md5sum.jpg" and die $?;
How many shared hosts are likely going to have /mnt/site/ available to their users? There's also
    system qq{ ffmpeg -i "$movie_fn" -vcodec copy -acodec copy "/tmp/$movie_base_fn" } and die;
How many shared hosts are likely going to have ffmpeg installed and allow their users to sit there transcoding video?
Though this is part of the movie post processing process, and since it isn't even possible to upload yet, it isn't really that applicable.
But wait, there's more!
    my $uri = '
    &lt;snip&gt;
    $client-&gt;ua-&gt;credentials(
        "127.0.0.1:8332", 'jsonrpc', 'bitcoinrpc' =&gt; $config::bitcoincorerpcpass,
    );
Why did you even bother?
    ($user) = query( "select * from users where cookie = ? ", $password, ); # their password is in their cookie
    if( $user ) {
        my $cookie = CGI::cookie( -name =&gt; 'account', -value =&gt; $user-&gt;cookie, -expires =&gt; '+1y', );
So not only are you storing their password in the database as-is and in the cookie as-is, you insist on a 1 year cookie expiration?!
However I can't really even tell how the password system seems to work, it just seems to join together a bunch of random phrases from the "words" file, which is just a massive dictionary.
Then there's this:
     my $usd = $btc * 300; # approximately convert from BTC to USD
Was a simpler time back then I suppose, you should update that to 240 at least! Or hell, do something really novel and crazy, actually pull the price from a proper exchange!
As well it seems to have potential XSS attacks coming out the whazoo but it's hard to say since it's so damn difficult to see what's going on.
Also learn how to use a damn gitignore file so you don't have random files just cluttering up the repo.
I hope nobody actually uses this crap and someone actually goes to some effort. This is just embarrassing, it's up there with DCoin in terms of terribleness. But at least the author of DCoin had a product with a decent set of features, even if they were all universally badly implemented.

I'd ask if ChangeTip was aware their API is leaking profile data for senders/receivers (regardless of whether it's private) of tips when they are broadcasted and via the API used for profiles.
I've been capturing this data for a few months and here's a small subset of it: 
For instance in this request you can probably see a few examples
Here's a screenshot: 
It seems to stem from the fact that ChangeTip is using Django and frankly doesn't really know what they're doing since they're just dumping out the tables as dicts.
Also their website performance absolutely sucks, is ChangeTip aware of this amazing thing called a "cache"? Such functionality is present in Django natively!

Don't forget in addition to spewing errors into the pages, log them into an overly complicated event management system and then never follow up on the actual errors.

I used this user profile API as an example, your Pubnub data includes the exact same information and is showing every tip.


But the assumption is that they don't want other users to see their tips? But that's doable by listening to the Pubnub data.


But it's not necessary to include their biography, locale and other miscellaneous data with it though.


That would be good but that is a bit of confusing terminology. How about levels of privacy: "Public", "Private", "Paranoid", where paranoid strips those tips from public profiles?


and probably assume if you provide your location, for instance, and opted for a private profile, that other people wouldn't be able to see it?


I use Django framework every day at work and it legitimately makes me a very angry person.


I will admit I only really do it for the laffs. I would not call it misleading though, personally, though maybe very snarky! Though I'll smugly say I've been a part of the Buttcoin Movement^TM since before the subreddit was in use and therefore am essentially Buttcoin alumni at this point.
