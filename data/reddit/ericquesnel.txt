10% interest is added and has to be paid back on the loan.  I am just stating a fact. Not guaranteeing anything. 
 BTCJam.com does have collection agency's, and will contact the proper local authorities if I do not repay this loan.  They have all my information to locate, and contact me.  Everything is verified.  Go through the application process to find out more.
So please calm down.  My rating actually has improved from a D- to a C, simply because I am following the rules.
By the way, you are right about the name change thing.  Apparently when I linked my bitcointalk account to btcjam.com the name changed with it for the alias.  Thank you for pointing that out for me.  LiquidGamerX is a rather stupid name.  However I have had it since childhood.

7% interest in 30 days.  Invest as little or as much as you would like.
This loan will pay for ASIC Mining hardware, and the rest will be put on BTC-E.com and various other cryptocurrency exchanges. 
This is also a loan to help boost my reputation.  Please rate when loan is complete.

I didn't this qualified as "begging" considering the intention is to pay back the people who invested.  I thought begging is when you ask for bitcoins without the intention of paying back.
Am I wrong?

Interesting, then how am I making around 2 bitcoins a month with 5.3Gh/s?  Thats around $250 a month.  I paid 2.5 bitcoins.  In 2 and a half months, I will be receiving enough to cover what I spent, and start profiting. 
To the people who invest, it doesn't matter if I make a profit now, or ever.  I still am required to payback this loan plus 10% interest, and I have with previous loans.  I need a good rep on BTCJam.com, this site will help me for the future.

Why are you doing this to me?  You agreed that if I took out the word guarantee, you would stop flaming me.  What is your problem with investments, and loans.  You post them right from the BTCJam.com listing.  This is a legit site.  I am trying to do legit work.
@_date: 2013-09-18 13:16:16
I didn't change my name on BTCJam, what are you talking about?
Also you were the one who told me to delete the posts so you would stop flaming me.  Now you are using it against me. Don't you think thats kind of rude?

Its a LOAN, which means I have to pay it back no matter what.  Both listings are for different loans.  If you checked my profile you would see where I rate.

Yes of course.  I own a small company (  ) .  I would just sell some of the inventory. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 11:28:34
This loan is covered by inventory on hand.  The purchase will be for the asic blade.  This will be added to our current mining rigs.

DVD writer? Wtf are you talking about?
I'm not asking for one person to invest 5.5 BTC. BTCJam.com supports multiple investors.  You can invest as little as .0001BTC if you want.  This is not a joke, its rather serious.

Here is a chance for you to make a 10% return for investing in ASIC mining hardware.  This loan will cover the amount needed to purchase an asic blade. This will juice the mining rig up to 15.3 Gh/s. Which is about 0.138 Bitcoins a day, 4.14 Bitcoins a month.
This loan will be paid in two installments of 3.15 bitcoins on the first of every month.
You can invest as little, or as much as you would like!

Im in it for the long haul, the loan will be paid back before I see a return on my investment.  The price is right for these rigs, and if bitcoins continue to rise in price, I think I will be fine.
