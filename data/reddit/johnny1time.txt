This kind of attack is gonna rear its head in one form or another in any anonymous, fully peer-to-peer payment system.
The underlying problem is that you're relying on the nodes of a p2p network to maintain a payment history; the consensus opinion of all the nodes defines the "truth". But if you don't have a central authority that's assigning identities and deciding who can be a node in the network, then you'll always have the problem that a single powerful adversary can impersonate many nodes. Once he controls enough nodes, he can start tricking other nodes into believing different truths and can start double-spending his monies.
John Douceur wrote a [paper]( that laid out this problem and argued convincingly that there's no way to prevent someone from impersonating many nodes and launching a [Sybil attack]( Like, you could say, "one identity per IP address," but then a powerful adversary could come at you with a bunch of IPs in his quiver. You could say, "one identity per X amount of computing power" (the Bitcoin approach), but then someone with a truckload of video cards could attack you.
You could use social network-based reputation systems, but you'd lose some of Bitcoin's anonymity, and it still wouldn't be bulletproof. Any solution to this problem comes at the expense of decentralization and anonymity; and the more reliable it is, the less anonymous it is.

Below I show that $3-5MM should be enough for majority CPU.
Why did the Chinese supercomputer cost so f'ing much more?
* It's built with Nvidia cards that are good at floating point ops (good for scientific computing) but suck at integer ops (bad for Bitcoin). Since you'd need like 8-10x more video cards in your truck if you were [building your rig out of Nvidia cards]( that accounts for a lot of the price difference.
* Supercomputers are built to handle scientific computing problems with fine-grained parallelism, like solving linear systems. The communication backplane to make that happen isn't cheap. Bitcoin mining, OTOH, is [embarassingly parallel]( -- the parallel tasks never have to communicate.
* The Chinese bought 262 TB of RAM and 2 PB of disks, while our determined hedge fund manager or small goverment could do with like 1 TB of RAM and one 50 GB disk.

I agree that a big double spending attack would quickly erode faith in Bitcoin and devalue the currency. 
Note that that doesn't automatically mean it wouldn't be profitable: Imagine I double spend all my BTC. Spooked traders drop the value to $2/BTC. I don't hold any BTC during the price drop. Now I can buy more BTC with USD at $2/BTC and double spend with exactly the same 100% profit as before.
In general, though, you've convinced me that the threat of devaluation makes the "big metal for double spending" attack a risky, if not bad, investment: You might not be able to cash out before you destroy the currency. I think your best bet would be to trickle out the double spending slowly over many years; sporadic complaints of disappearing payments could be attributed to network partitions or who-knows-what, and the currency would shrug it off.
For profit-seekers, though, there are other ways than double spending to get a return on their big metal investment. Like, if the futures market gets big enough, someone could take a big short position in BTC, and then crash the value to zero. For enemies that just want to shut down Bitcoin, $3-5-10MM is a cheap price to achieve total destruction.
The important point, I think, is that everybody believes the kind of computer power postulated by TFA -- the power to game Bitcoin, double spend, delete targeted transactions, destroy the currency -- is laughably beyond reach. In your [earlier comment]( you suggested the price of such a system might be around $88MM*20/2.5 = $704MM, or 16x the market cap of BTC. In reality, it's only around $5MM (according to me) or $10MM (according to your last comment).

How about I substitute some math for your italics.
Difficulty is now [244139]( That [corresponds]( to a current hash rate of 244139 * 2^32 / 600 = 1748 GHash/s for the entire network.
The best mining cards hash at [800+ MHash/s]( So if I had a truck full of 1748000/800 = 2,185 video cards, I could control 1/2 the CPU power in the Bitcoin network.
Admittedly that would be a big truck. But it's certainly within reach of a determined adversary with a few million $. Given that the current total value of BTC is around [6297750 BTC]( = $44MM, it should scare the shit out of you that someone with $3-$5MM to spare can control a majority of the network.
The Sybil attack paper warns that a very powerful, determined adversary can game any p2p consensus protocol, and Bitcoin is currently in Sybil's wheelhouse. The network is small enough that "very powerful" is easily within reach of a *single* rich person (let alone a hedge fund manager). Now it just remains to be seen how determined they are.
