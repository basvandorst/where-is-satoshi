Some lonely night in 2012 I was at home and had the random thought go through my head "I wonder if there is a way to buy drugs online?" so I started googling and came across things like SilkRoad and Bitcoin.  At the time they were $8 a coin, so I figured I'd find out how to buy them.  I can't even recall the site that I bought them from but I remember I had to go to my local CVS to use their red Moneygram phone to authorize a bank transfer to get the coins deposited into an address.  At the time I only viewed them strictly as drug money and clearly had no idea of the potential outside of that, otherwise I'd be loaded right now.  Around the time they were going for $100 I became more intrigued, and when they went all the way up to $1200 before the first China ban or Mt. Gox hack, whatever it was, I knew that I would have to hold tight onto whatever I had, going forward.  That bear market that lasted for years was dull as hell but I'm glad I held through it all.

I'm betting he'll have someone warn the audience before he comes out to not say anything about bitcoin or crypto currency.  He's so sick of hearing about it he could puke at this point.

I dunno, I kinda liked the Spinal Tap one.

I got both.   I like my trezor slightly better.

I remember going to CVS in 2012 and buying using MoneyGram when they were $8 a coin.

It appears that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:35:19
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:21
This was some intentional misleading bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:54:10
 You're referring to a bullshit misleading headline. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:15:01
Maybe something to do with dogecoin.

Any success with that username?

This might interest you:
of course some of these may have multiple wallets.

Damn :(

I'm with you my man.   Somewhere down the road there may be an ideal use for each.   That's why I've kept everything intact when the forks occur; you never know.

Does anyone know what the average amount is that subscribers to this subreddit own?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:54:57
I'm still confused by this.  So are there now a combined 42 million(2x 21 million) of bitcoin and bitcoin cash or two separate cryptos that share the same pool of potential coins? If I hodled in an offline wallet do I now have double the amount of coins with half being in bitcoins and the other half in bitcoin cash? Or do I have either one at any time they can just be converted back and forth at any time?

Got you covered fam: 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:09:05

It's OK ToTheMoonGuy, one of these days, one of these days...

Well they finally transferred my money into bitcoins last night, but unfortunately they gave me yesterday's market value worth instead of March 14th's.  Oh well, I am just glad my money is no longer just floating out there in limbo.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:07:14
Add me to the list of lost money.  Hopefully they will resolve this issue soon.  They currently have $145 of my money with no bitcoins in sight.

I made a transaction March 14th for $145.  March 20th, still no sign of bitcoins or money.  Definitely the fastest I've ever seen my money disappear with nothing to show for it.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:54:02
any updates?
I too am missing my bitcoins that I payed for March 14th with no word at all of when I will get them.
