Right click, and view source, its all in-line javascript. Beta testing is going on here  and it suggests It will be uploaded to github soon. :)

It's looking like they are making progress.

This anonymous report seems to have come out at the perfect time (as a rally is starting) It smells to me like someone is at least trying to prevent another rally from happening.

gpu is more decentralized? Umm.. Can you remind me how many GPU hardware providers there are that are suitable for mining on, and then compare that number to how many ASIC mining manufactures there are.
Further more, proof of stake coins generally suck as ripple and nxt have shown.

Looks like a pretty good sign!

Looks great, but also looks a lot like  which also seems to be slightly ahead of you.

Very interesting, at least there appears to be some kind of progress after the long wait

This is nice and everything, but what makes this project different from web based projects that already exist like  or

So to clarify you'd say tried and tested browser based wallets including; blockchain.info, bitaddress.org, brainwallet.org, coinb.in, bitrated.com as well as bitcoinjs are fundamentally unsafe? Instead you would suggest, people should be using this new application to generate multisig addresses, after vetting what looks like lots of code spread over hundreds of files... It then finally requires that you compile it on a independent machine or vps - "in the name of security". 
Seems like a lot of hassle for an average user (that I suspect wouldn't even know how to compile this code) who can get exactly the same result from a browser based web service.
**Also, if the private and public keys are generated by another client (that is  offline), there is no security issue what so ever with your private keys, when using an online multi signature service, as they only require that you submit a public key.**
