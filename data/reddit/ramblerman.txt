The Federal Reserve spending a few hundred billion to purchase and then destroy seems unlikely. Consider in that situation they would also be in danger of another cryptocurrency just starting the whole thing over again.
What seems more likely is that governments at one point or another are going to have to face, and define legal status of bitcoins. In Europe the economic crisis is hugely in our favour in this regard. 
Ten years ago bitcoins could have easily been declared illegal with lots of september 11th rhetoric. Now, with the mistrust in the banks, any further move to limit economic freedom would meet resistance. Even if people don't own bitcoins it would be a matter of principle.

thats a bit silly, I can offer to sell you my pen for 1,000,000 dollars,  it doesn't mean that is its agreed value.
The market price will be 1000 per BTC when people actually buy at that price.

Nonsense, Any casino game perhaps. And Satoshi dice or other lotteries certainly.
But gambling can imply games where you're just playing against other players, like poker (outside of a casino) where there isn't a house cut.
EDIT: also it's lose not loose

Aren't these always discounted?
Otherwise, why would I exchange 10 dollars into 10 dollars I can only spend on starbucks.

lol I just tried to find an analogy for how big that number was. If it takes a millisecond to try a combination, then since the big bang to now you could have only tried 4.2139008 × 10^20 combinations.  a number 2.7478 × 10^56 smaller than 2^128.

I'm not sure why you think that is relevant to the discussion at hand. Both bandwith and computer power follow an exponential growth rate, the article merely states that bandwith has a slower growth rate, meaning it would be the bottleneck.
Satoshi assumes human population is capped at some fixed limit or at the very least can not sustain an exponential growth rate indefinitely. As such the amount of transactions is linear. The respective growth factors of memory, power and bandwith and which one is bigger become a moot point when comparing them to a linear function.

But if a colored bitcoin ever comes in contact with an existing wallet it's destroyed no? Or even worse, I could just send a couple of bitcoins to your public address, essentially wiping your special bitcoin.
How do you distinguish the special penny in a bag full of identical pennies so to speak.

Off shore accounts in the Eastern Carribean are slightly misleading. It's highly doubtful these people are storing their money in Eastern Caribbean Dollars.
Finally, and most important with real money, you have to take credit into account. What is in circulation does not equal the total value. I can store a million dollars in the bank which doesn't take a million dollars out of circulation (the bank doesn't put the physical money in a safe). A number like US exports or GDP would be far more useful.
An even more useful analysis imho is to use 
    
    Ecommerce sales topped 1 trillion for 2012 or 83,333,333,333 per month
    if 1 % of those sales in a month (833,333,333) happened in bitcoin
    a bitcoin would have to be worth (833,333,333/24,000,000)  ~ 34 dollars
    to accomodate that amount
    at the current amount of bitcoins (833,333,333/10,000,000)  ~ 83 dollars 
    
This is considering that everyone holding bitcoins is using them, with people hoarding the value goes up even further, not to mention lost or destroyed bitcoins.
Lastly the analysis doesn't account for 
- all the people currently wiring money home through western union and the like. A piece of that pie would increase the value further. 
- online gambling.
- online sales are expected to hit $1.298 trillion this year

I'm not American, and it seems I'm probably getting a somewhat skewed picture into american politics from here. My apologies if I over-extended my biases, we have a very liberal media here in holland.


Because, and I could be wrong on this too,  their strong libertarian roots. I would think the notion of bitcion plays right into their ideology. With other groups (more accepting of government fiscal control) more convincing might be required.


Agreed 100%

If every alternative cryptocurrency is just more gold the whole point of a limited supply diminishes. I think a hierarchy will develop, and that is a good thing.

Do you really think your analogy is clearer? You first have to explain what a rai stone is to then define how it is similar to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:46:44
I think it's a bad idea, because
1) I believe QR codes and various other mechanisms will make the underlying bitcoin protocol almost transparent once it is widely adopted. Users of the future (think grandma) will not be using bitcoin the way we do now.
2) Using a vanity address actually makes it easier to scam someone. Something like 1CocaCoLa555 looks more trustworthy than a random address. 
3) Companies receiving money and engaging in actual ecommerce will typically want to generate an address per client. This makes managing money way easier than having to have the user input his sending address.
The only real use I could see for it is for accepting donations (in which case a lot of people already use vanity addresses for that)

I think people downvote because this isn't really financially relevant. It is also often used against bitcoin, to highlight its volatilty and 'boomlike' growth.
Add to that, the fact that you're winging about downvotes, and it's an easy decision really.

chalash provides some great answers in the site comments, I formatted them here for record and discussion:


Price instability is conceivably bad for both merchants and customers. You don't want to receive something that will be worth less tomorrow, nor do you want to pay for something that you could buy for half price in a day. However, this problem is already solved through payment processors such as BitPay who allow people to transact in Bitcoin and be credited in USD. It completely removes the exchange rate risk so that people can continue doing business as usual. You may ask, "Why would somebody pay with Bitcoin when they could use USD?" And I would offer you this value proposition. Amazon turns over an enormous amount of revenue but has a comparatively small profit margin. Credit card charges of 2-3% are a large part of their cost structure. Using Bitcoins, even through an intermediary payment processor, would in effect, double their profit. That's without doing anything else whatsoever. Yes, you read that right. Double.


Bitcoin has very similar fundamentals to precious metals, which are analyzed and traded in highly liquid markets around the globe. It can be inspected from a number of angles including but not limited to supply and demand, price action, user uptake, trade volume, trade velocity, investor attitudes, and geopolitical developments.


This argument I find the most difficult to understand. Taken to an absurd level, it sounds to me that you are saying: "Bitcoin will become so valuable that it will become worthless." You build the case that the price will go up, and that people will not spend their coins, and then price will continue to rise. But you leave us there, with Bitcoins holders being worth millions of dollars, before you jump, in my opinion, a very long distance in an odd direction to claim that this will kill the currency. What would happen, in fact, is that people will always spend or sell their Bitcoins at a price. This price is different for different people, and that's why we have market places. You do mention that from time to time wealthy individuals may flood the market with Bitcoins, but from your stance, this should a solution to the hoarding problem, rather than a new problem in itself. Can you have it both ways?


Anybody with money has clout. And Bitcoin early adopters would be no exception. It's natural to be envious of any early adopter, including those fine ladies and gentlemen in silicon valley who seem to always find ways to retire when they are 30. But remember, that the worst thing rich people can do it buy something from you. It's the tax man who has his hand in your pocket.

Not quite, Satoshi actually takes this into consideration in his paper. The idea is that by following Moore's law it will only be a problem early on. The speed at which bandwith and memory are increasing is faster than that of possible bitcoin transactions.
That being said I do think it's enough of a short term problem to warrant serious scrutiny.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:56:31
I would think the problem is finding investors. If you find those, you can issue them stock through contract, you don't need to go public to sell stocks.
I don't see the added value of using colored bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-18 06:40:43
Yes, let's build an online ledger that tracks every single bitcoin transaction from birth. Only to then remove a few transactions cause they seem stupid?

I waited a full month between April and May to withdraw my money from MtGox (via SEPA). After a long back and forth with a helpdesk who considered this to be normal and still no money I cancelled the request, bought bitcoins, moved them to bitstamp, resold for cash, and had my money 3 days later.
I deal solely with them ever since.
