I'm confused what you mean - in the scenario the merchant has recorded a loss, why would they not care?

Why isn't it necessary? Are those transactions more secure?

That's interesting, because a month or two ago there was a story about someone losing a fair chunk of btc. I'm trying to remember the details but I believe that they were scammed using some well known 'attack' where the hash was invalidated after the sale completed, which reversed the transaction (but not the sale, obviously - the goods had already changed hands, effectively).
What I remember clearly was that the response on was "That's why you always wait for seven confirmations."

Between that statement and your implied belief that restaurants are going to be fine with patrons walking out the door without knowing if their payment will go through or not, I feel like you must live in a different society than I do. While I have no trouble believing that most counterfeit currency is of larger denominations, I would be astounded to find out there wasn't currently 1 dollar bills in circulation. I'd be willing to bet there are counterfeit quarters as well.
Furthermore, I'm not talking about a 51% attack here. I'm talking about exploiting [Transaction Malleability]( Transaction Malleability requires comparatively little effort to pull off - you only need to find a misbehaving node and have it invalidate a hash before the block is confirmed, causing a split. That is my understanding, I'm open to corrections as I'm still trying to learn exactly how this works. (For instance, is it possible to be that misbehaving node yourself? That's not clear to me.)
The only defense - as far as I know - to this attack is to wait for multiple confirmations. The more confirmations the better, and the standard seems to be 7 for virtual certainty that a transaction will stand. Even if you only wait for one confirmation, though, you're still waiting 7 minutes (or something like that) - that's WAY too slow for point-of-sale applications.

I don't think that's true, though. [Transaction Malleability]( means that you can't trust a block until it has been confirmed, and conventional wisdom appears to be that seven confirmations are needed for strong confidence of persistence in the block chain. I could see small point-of-sale transactions only needing two or three for the seller to be confident, but even then you're talking about waiting something like 15 minutes to be sure that the transaction is 'safe'.

Ah, got it. You mean dockeysnakee is giving a hand wave, not the merchant. :)

Aren't you supposed to wait for seven block confirmations before considering a transaction closed? That takes considerably longer than 15 minutes, doesn't it?

Thank you for asking the important questions. People dismissing questions out of hand are why I'm still not buying btc. I try to keep informed but there are important questions that don't seem to be addressed still, and early adopters don't like to hear about it.

I very much appreciate the links and explanation!
