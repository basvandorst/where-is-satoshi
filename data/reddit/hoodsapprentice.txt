It is an open letter to degecoin moderators not to moolah_  
Please respect that

I am all for supporting charitable work and good causes, but some serious questions need to be raised about the Moolah.io and the founder Alex Green.  
I personally find the moolah.io business to be very questionable at least, I actually have a **strong suspicion that it is just a smartly run ponzi scheme** (or at least started as one). Moolah started as a business that offered ATMs that would support FIAT to BTC, DOGE and LTC exchange and many other features with the deadline of delivering them set to March 28. During the financing of his project he promised to post the video of the unit possibly even showing his face but that has never happened.
Shortly before the ATM shipping deadline I placed a post on reddit     
In this post **my worst case scenario was that moolah would not release the ATMs but refund the backers from the money he raised from the future investors** in his platform (at least 250 BTC each round)    
In the comments to this post user moolah_ **again promised to release the video of the working machine within 2 days** (Here is my comment quoting his response  
**Prior to this post there was no mention of any problems with ATMs or delays or refunds. Even more moolah posted both on reddit and on his blog comments suggesting that the units were actually packed and ready to ship.**  
Again **the promised video was never released.** Moolah build his credibility even further holding wallet for doge4nascar **while at the same time rising the second round of investment for his business (another 250BTC)**
I tried to educate people but it seemed the most trust him blindly and see questioning him as a blasphemy   
The post in which **I asked to verify his identity by simply having a video call with dogecoin founders** was heavily downvoted and eventually deleted
in the comments I was called names
  
When I heard about the third round of investment I decided to post again this time placing my post in a form of **an open letter to dogecoin founders and the moderators** of dogecoin subreddit. The main thing I asked in the letter was **publishing their official stance on moolah.io business.**  
The post was **immediately removed from dogecoin subreddit** and I ended up placing it on vertcoin subreddit. **Please take your time to read it, especially the comments exchange between me and moolah_ (I link to his various posts quoting his previous position on atms)**  
  
I pm’d the dogecoin moderators about the post but **have not received any official response**, well unless you take the post about the new banning rules as the response:
  
You can find a clear reference to my letter - but no actual link to it:


  
I tried to reply to this in a civilised manner - but it looks like my account or at least some comments are shadow banned on degecoin as I could not see my comment when not logged in 
(it is still visible in my post history view   
(**Update**: it seems to to visible now but was not for while the post was active and visited by people as you can guess from a lack of any sort of response/downvotes)  
Basically what I am saying is I have a strong view that the moolah.io is a very questionable business, and people should do a strong background check before supporting them.  
Moolah made the dogecoin community believe that the future of moolah is equivalent to the future of dogecoin. **He did not pay anyone to follow him. He was much smarter than that. He got the people to pay him to in fact become his PR staff.** In his first round of investment (PIE) he accepted investment as small as 50,000 Doge. I believe that **hundreds of members of dogecoin put their doge for moolah.** Once they put their own money in moolah they want to believe in it even more and they take any critique of moolah personally. Any questioning is met with accusation of spreading FUD, being a competitor, wanting dogecoin to fail etc. and heavily downvoted.  
**PS**  
I recently learned that the dogecoin mod who commented on my deleted post in bitcoin sub 
is an investor in moolah. Here is his post admitting to this fact    . In the same comment he bans for bringing this issue up.  
I must say that it sounds a bit like a conflict of interests but questioning so is now a bannable offence on dogecoin subreddit.  (  
TL;DR: Aks questions about moolah.io and the identity of Alex Green before handling your money to them. There are indications that moolah.io can be a ponzi scheme. Moolah.io rised 750BTC from investors plus money for ATM units (never seen). The charity work can be just a trust building method for possible ponzi.  **Suport trusted charities**

that kind of conflicts with your own statement


And still we have not seen any videos demonstrations of the units

Thats ok, it seems that many post critical to moolah.io are deleted. I was suprised to see an open letter removed though.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:46:47
It is an open letter and states facts only, and it is followed by a single sentenced opinion. I do not understand why it was removed. Is an open discussion on crypto business not allowed?
As I stated in the letter I decided to make my concerns public and heard, now it is your call to make your own judgement on whether those concerns are funded. In any case you cannot say that you were not made aware of those concerns.
