may i ask why? all you're doing is cutting out the preferred payment method of 99.9% of your potential customers. i'm all for more shops accepting btc but to restrict purchases to btc only seems like a very bad business decision to me.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:39:56
most of it is the same as it ever was, exchange gains are taxed no different than my etrade gains, merchants need to account for sales tax in their pricing and reporting, etc. i think a real interesting question is how you account for employers that pay wages in btc. sure, my w-2 could say i earned 120btc annual salary and i can report that, but what value does that get taxed at? maybe in jan the 10btc i was paid were worth $500 but in nov that same 10btc monthly salary was worth $800. 
either way i think this is an important discussion to have if we're ever going to btc be a real part of society. i know a lot of people on this sub are against any gov involvement but that's simply not a realistic goal if we want btc to be the future of digital currency.
my only real plea is that gov not start requiring onerous costs on the inherent advantages of btc in terms of transaction cost and global transfer ability.

simple fact: not one person was forced to put money in gox.

i think music (and media in general) can really leverage bitcoin to get around the credit card fees for small purchases. if he sells a song on his site for $1, his credit card co will charge him roughly 3% plus around $.15 for every transaction. while the 3% is no biggie, $.15 for each sale is a major pita if your sale is only $1. so, bitcoin will let him keep the fees that normally go to the credit card co on his subscription sales (coinbase allows for subscription payments i believe) which is not a huge deal but a win. more importantly, he can now profitably sell individual tracks on his own, no itunes taking 30% or beatport taking whatever it is they take.
also, because edm is so global in nature, this means he can easily sell to anyone in the world by using bitcoin without the additional hassles and fees of accepting other currencies or dealing with people from countries that don't have a lot of credit cards in use.
i'm sooooo pissed bitcoin wasn't around when i tried building my music site back in 06-07. the major hurdle we had was trying to be profitable while selling $1 songs and giving up 75-80% to the artists, then another 15-20% to the credit card processor. bitcoin would have let us build the site we wanted and i might have never had to go get a real job again. (/rant)
idea edit- when dude plays out at clubs/festivals he can flash a qr code on the screen on stage and let people buy the track he's playing as he plays it. did i just blow your mind, maaaaaaan?

in theory, i agree. in reality, i don't trust the honesty nor competency of the average human when it comes to my money. so i want safeguards in place. unfortunately those safeguards will be put in place by other humans and sometimes be too much, but when it comes to my money i prefer to err on the side of safety. while not the majority in this sub, i think the majority of the populace would agree with that sentiment. thus, if we want bitcoin to be adopted on a wide consumer level some regulations are going to be put in place before consumers really start trusting bitcoin as a functional currency for trade and not some crazy internet get rich quick scheme.


uh, yeah they do. if it creates a more prosperous populace and a larger tax base they have plenty of incentive.

while i agree that keeping your coins yourself is indeed safer, the difference between coinbase and gox is the people running it. one of the main backers of coinbase is the guy that gave us the modern web browser. there are well known and reputed professional investors and management involved, not a few schlubs and their cats. i'm sure there's different legal standards in place as well by virtue of location.

if you would buy a product with bitcoin you would buy it with cash. if you wouldn't buy it unless you could use bitcoin you're not really a lost customer, you're someone trying to prove a point.
'promoter' is what i see all the time on here when people say 'i told my favorite business/boss all about bitcoin, the tech, how it's the future, how it's not just drug money and gox failures' etc etc etc without showing one lick of care for the business owner's perspective. the owner doesn't give a flying fuck about this new internet money, the business owner cares about making more real money. you keep ignoring the ways they can make more money to tell them how much you like bitcoin, they will keep ignoring you.

it's a horrible idea. itunes gift cards are incredibly popular items come holiday time so this freezes out a lot of potential bitcoin adopters.
if you actually give a shit about the 'community' you want to make sure businesses that serve said community keep offerings that the mass populace wants so we can advance more mass populace adoption of bitcoin.
actions like this and the postings i see about businesses only accepting bitcoin only serve to ghettoize the bitcoin community in to a corner when we need to be widening the net.

no argument there (well, some people still would so they can dodge us taxes). but some of us weren't so greedy that we couldn't wait for well established, backed, secured, and regulated opportunities to be made available here in the states. i lost precisely $0 at gox because i don't put significant amounts of money in back alley businesses. it's not like there's a shortage of investment opportunities in america. if you feel those opportunities aren't worth your time and money because of regulations, then you deal with the results you get playing the overseas crapshoot on your own.

c'mon dude, that's not anywhere near a close comparison and you know it


and if regulation limits the ability of businesses like gox from stealing/losing hundreds of millions of dollars i'd say the regulation is well thought out.
regulation is a delicate balance. you need to allow people to feel secure that they aren't investing with a company that will vanish in to thin air with their money while at the same time not regulating businesses to the point of stifling innovation. that takes time and it will never be a perfect balance. if you can't be patient then go drop some coin in some overseas back alley, just don't blame the government when your shit gets taken.

I don't understand why people think a bitcoin only business is a good idea. You are effectively cutting off 99.9% of potential customers. This doesn't help adoption, it further ghettoizes bitcoin.

it seemed to me that the ramp up started in china early and then really rocketed once the uk report dropped. i think those were bigger sources since the devalued ruble story was floating around the news well before the run started. plus, i doubt there's enough cash moving out of the ukraine to btc to move the needle at all.
i also think the market has decided the gox story is over as far as any effect on the exchange rate and money that was sitting on the sidelines decided today was a good day to jump back in.

going to preface this with i am more of a buy and hold bitcoin guy and not a trader so perspectives may vary.
jumping on the coinbase train. probably not the best choice if you're looking for super duper bitcoin anonymity but most of these shops (to me at least) look like back alley knockoff shops ready to run off with my money at the drop of a hat. coinbase is as safe as bitcoin can be in my opinion and if it means i pay taxes on any profits i make, i'm cool with that.
actually it's kind of a good day. they're not actually selling any more coins today but if you place an order you will get it on friday at the market rate. while in theory this sucks, you can cancel the order up to execution so if between now and then the price moves to a limit you're uncomfortable with on either side you can back out of the buy. it's essentially 0 loss risk but you could miss upside.

don't take this sub too seriously, there are some crazy mother fuckers here.  
sell your bitcoin right now if you are not prepared to deal with it going to $0 tomorrow.  
don't obsessively check the price and watch the charts. sounds like you're in this for long term so remember that daily/weekly/monthly trends are not make or break to you.  
next time you buy something online, see if you can buy it from a place that accepts bitcoin. don't use your investment coin, grab a little pocket change. the best thing that can happen to bitcoin is adoption, you can help adoption by spending coin.
have fun, there's a lot of really cool things happening with the technology that can have a major impact on how the world deals with money in the future. you are now a part of that.

i've always thought the use of the word 'coin' was a problem to people that don't want to be bothered to learn about the intricacies of btc. i really think satoshis or bits would be a better terminology, especially considering they could represent the smaller denominations we will be using on a more regular basis for commerce. when the layman hears 'coin' they think of a circular piece of metal with a defined value attached to it. trying to make them make the mental leap to a virtual coin is difficult.

real simple proposition mr merchant: by switching to bitcoin take whatever % of sale you are now saving by not being subject to onerous processing fees and split the difference between you and the customer. saving 4%? reduce price by 2%, keep the extra 2% for yourself.
it should be every business' wet dream to be able to increase margins while simultaneously lowering prices and attracting a larger customer base. this is the argument to be made to businesses, not all the stupid 'take mah bitcoin pleeeeease' crap i see posted here so often.

his initial post claimed people 'were forced' to invest in gox, which is garbage. 
he's more than welcome to make the unfounded assumption that people would have lost less if us regulations were more lax. but the simple fact that they are not more lax prevented gox from ever existing in the us in the first place. that is what they are intended to do. the regulations worked as designed. so i'm going to assume that they saved lots of people a lot more money because they never even knew about nor wanted any part of gox.

phrases like 'bow down before the government' do not help your cause. do you want to discuss this like a rational adult or an angsty teen? one of those will help bitcoin spread to the masses, one of them will not.
and by the way, not everyone thinks the purpose of bitcoin is to route around the government. i'm looking to route around bs fees of credit card companies, remittance services, and banks. far as i'm concerned i will gladly pay my gov taxes on trading gains and report sales tax from btc purchases at my business.

You're ignoring the risk that bitcoin never gets there in the first place. If bitcoin gains acceptance for 5 years then loses to something else that is very different than another coin being the crypto that the world uses for the next 5 years.

nobody on this board is bitching about her positioning of this story as fact vs theory. please point me in the direction of one such statement if i'm mistaken. 


so do we throw out every quote in the history of the press? what more do you need than the journo standing by it, the cops confirming it, and even dorian himself admitting he said it (he later claimed he was misinterpreted). the quote stands as more legit than anything i have seen on this board all week.


not going to, but i could easily find plenty of comments here from the past week directly disputing that. even so, that is no need to stifle discussion.


there's plenty of compelling evidence if you view this story objectively. not anything that makes it undeniable truth, but plenty to infer that dorian is a possibility, and the best possibility we have found thus far.
look, i don't know what the truth is here. what i do know is leah has brought an interesting possibility to the table, which is what she should do as an investigative journalist, and we should review and discuss it openly and not just slam the door on any possibility we don't necessarily want to hear.

sorry, going to disagree. maybe if there were regulations concerning proof of available reserves and 3rd party security audits this doesn't happen. 
not that i think it's a fair comparison, but since you brought it up... where is madoff? jail, with millions paid back to the people defrauded. where's mark? starbucks, and nobody is ever getting a penny back.
edit- want to add on to this, i've heard it stated many times on here that the usa does not have significant exchanges because of the regulatory climate and government interference. you can't say the regulations to do business in america are so restrictive that exchanges have to be located elsewhere, and then say that regulations would not stop such exchanges like gox from acting in ways that would never fly under a regulated environment.

my point was mostly related to credit cards. i'm not of the mind that btc will replace cash or is a better option than cash for businesses, just that it can eat in to the market share for credit and provide cost savings there.

sorry, that's not the way business works. someone in the organization will take notice ONLY when there is evidence that it will make a difference in their quarterly earnings. tell someone in the finance dept that they can keep an extra 4% on all their ad sales that are paid for via credit card and you will have their ear. tell someone you like bitcoin and therefore they should take on the expense of building an entirely new financial infrastructure and deal with all the legal/accounting questions and they will go on with their day.

but neither does the digital copy of dkr i bought through google play. my idea here is strictly for digital media, if you bought the blu-ray that would not be part of that movie's ledger.


exactly. so let's say i buy the avengers on itunes and disney assigns the address of 123456 to my copy. if i copy it, then somewhere on the file's metadata is the ledger address of 123456 so the sharer can be identified (i.e. disney sees avengers copy 123456 sitting on mega.co and sends a fine/warrant/whatever to me as the owner of said address).  
or why couldn't the ledger prevent the copying of the file itself? doesn't it already do that for bitcoin?
like i said, maybe i'm way off base here, just trying to figure out if it can actually be done.

dad: ok, i remember how much we did last year  
you: great, now what % of that did you pay to your credit card merchant account?  
dad: i think something like 4%  
you: great, so that 4% was equal to how many dollars? now, what if you could keep that 4% for yourself? or even better, lower your prices by 2% and still get an extra 2% per job?  
dad: what do you mean?  
you: well dad, the beauty of bitcoin is because the payment is person to person there's no credit card/bank between you and your customer taking a cut. you keep all your revenue.
telling people how new and cool and futuristic bitcoin is doesn't matter. wider range of customers doesn't really matter, people that need their car fixed have cash and credit cards already. telling people how bitcoin makes them more money does.

"searching for satoshi" or "finding satoshi" where the overarching theme is you trying to track down the true identity of the protocol creator, and along the way you can tell the story of bitcoin, how it is being used, its proliferation, etc. i think just a straight up 'let me teach you the history of bitcoin' doc may come off a little dry, but satoshi sets up as this mythical figure that created this world changing thing and you searching for him gives viewers a storyline with a real emotional attachment.

Funny how everyone here jumps down Leah's throat and paints her as the devil for pics which revealed identifying information. You know, because article writers are the ones that make decisions on what photos run and an editor's job doesn't include removing such information. Clearly Leah's fault.
Funny how any attempt to discuss the possibilities presented by the article calmly and rationally are immediately voted down, but 'newsweek is owned by a cult' gets voted right up.
I don't know he truth. What I do know is Leah has presented an interesting possibility and it is certainly worth talking about without assuming you know the right answer because you've done the in depth research of...... what exactly?
I for one hope she's right just to see the mental gymnastics this board will have to do to rationalize the hate and vitriol that has been spilled this week.

um, no, he risked none of those things. he may have risked the first 2 if they weren't also still accepting usual forms of payment. if they never made 1 btc sale he would still be ceo of overstock and they would still be in business. all that would have happened is they would have pulled bitcoin sales and written down the money they invested in the infrastructure changes. and the 'freedom' comment is just immature. the gestapo is not coming for you if you use bitcoin.

i think you already missed the gox bottom, i don't believe we go near $400 again. we may be in a range for a bit until another catalyst arrives, but i'm not sure about any possible story from gox causing more of a drop at this point. maybe if it was thieves and they dump everything at once, but otherwise not much can happen via gox that be a drag. 
my opinion is we are very close to the end of the cheap coin. if second market or something like it gets going and opens the doors to real investment money coming in, we will ramp up fast. from there i think becomes a matter of consumer adoption.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:07:04
no offense, but i'm not giving you money just because you take bitcoin. maybe your project didn't resonate with the audience? maybe nobody bothered because you're already 3x over your goal?
lastly, and i can't stress this enough to anyone accepting bitcoin for their business, **don't simply wave a 'we take bitcoin' flag**. give people a reason to give a shit, that's what encourages participation and adoption. how about 'your donation goes even farther with bitcoin' since w/o cc fees you should be able to keep more of the money. if you're selling stuff on your site, try '2% discount if you pay with bitcoin' since cc fees are no longer part of the equation.  
now i'm off topic, but my plea to all the merchants out there; give people a reason to care that you take bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:54:39


really? because if i was in his shoes and i had nothing to ever do with bitcoin i would have said 'no' when she asked me and told her to leave me alone. and if a story that got out said otherwise i would have released a statement that unequivocally made clear i was not the creator nor had i ever had anyhting to do with it. then i would not have got in a car and gone to the office of the ap, i would have told people to leave me alone. asking to be taken out to lunch by a reporter is not the action of a man that wants to be left alone.
this is not what dorian did. imo, his actions only added credence to her story. he is not acting like someone caught up in something he had nothing to do with and wanting to be left alone. he could have denied flatly and told everyone to go home, he didn't.
i agree the doxxing was poor form, but again, that's not leah's fault. that falls on the lap of the editorial staff, but leah is the one catching the heat.

the best thing i think you can get across that connects with the layman is that because bitcoin is a p2p payment there is no need for credit card processors. so if you're a business owner you can now keep 100% of your sale instead of paying 4% to the credit card company (or keep an extra 2% while lowering your prices by 2%, lower prices AND greater profit!). if you're an international traveler you can take a holiday and (assuming easy btc access in your destination) get local currency without your bank killing you on exchange rate and overseas atm withdrawls. if you are sending money home every month you can avoid the gross fees from western union and their ilk. this is the kind of stuff that connects with the common man and i think we need more of.

end user- my guess is that this will provide thousands of end users their first exposure to bitcoin. when they go to buy a shirt and a 'pay with bitcoin for 3% off!' option they may be inspired to go learn more. also, it gives us thousands more places to spend our bitcoin.
site owner- this will enable thousands of site owners to be exposed to bitcoin and its benefits. and once they start receiving money in bitcoin they will start keeping/spending bitcoin which helps build the economy. and while it was always possible to accept bitcoin before, being able to reduce complexity (particularly at check-out) to the end user by having the appearance of less options means higher conversion rates.

true, but alibaba is not simply a chinese marketplace, even if china is the dominant market represented.
i would think if btc were allowed to suppliers that wanted to use it, and chinese suppliers started noticing they were losing business to those markets, the chinese situation might be loosened. start putting a dent in china's export market and watch how fast the government changes its tune, even if it were nothing more than permitting chinese suppliers to accept btc payments via the site then immediately converting them to yuan for transmission to a chinese bank.

regardless, regulation is coming whether we like it or not. the question is will we contribute to the conversation and the shaping of those regulations or will we shut down any such conversation and let the powers that be make all the decisions without any input from the community? i ask because every time any sort of article about regulation is submitted to this sub, people downvote it because 'government bad!'. that is not the way to move forward.

@_date: 2014-03-02 16:25:13


this comment is not about you personally but i find this indicative of a real problem. by switching to btc and essentially removing a 4% cost from your side you gain 4% more revenue for each sale, yet the thought did not even occur to you to pass some saving to the customer? why would the average person bother with switching to or learning about bitcoin when you are not providing any advantage? furthermore, as a consumer that actually is knowledgeable about bitcoin if you're not offering me savings i'll still pay with my cc because of the additional hassles of refunds with btc since i can't get a chargeback if you send me a defective item and refuse to replace it. i have precisely 0 reasons to buy anything from you with bitcoin. 
even if you split the difference you could a offer 2% lower price and still get 2% more revenue than on a credit card sale. this would incentivize your customers to use btc, thus growing the share of your sales in btc, thus growing your profit margin on each sale you now make in btc vs cc. so how about instead of grasping for every last cent you can you realize there are greater benefits to the long term health of your business? 
then take this same logic and tell your suppliers and vendors you want to pay them in btc because they can also gain a 2% bump in revenue while reducing your costs by 2%. now we start creating value all the way up the chain, from supplier to retailer to customer which only furthers wider adoption of bitcoin.
if all you're going to do is offer another payment option that really nobody outside of a small sliver of people use then it will never take off nor contribute to your growth. and you will still be stuck handing over 4% of all your sales to the cc company.
use the advantages of bitcoin to help every facet of your business, not just to get some goodwill from a small community of early adopters.

going to keep saying this until it sinks in- merely offering products in bitcoin or asking a business if they take it accomplishes nothing. you want a business to take bitcoin? make sure and when you write them to include the actual benefits to their business! 
hey nyt,  
do you guys offer bitcoin subscriptions? i'd love to sign up if you did. the beauty of you accepting bitcoin for payments is that there are virtually no processing fees so instead of you losing 4% of my subscription payment to your credit card merchant partner you get an extra 4% of revenue! plus, bitcoin is perfect for micro-transactions you could even have a system that allows people to read individual articles for a small fee. i feel like this could be a great benefit to your business and your readers and really help you grow top line revenue. thanks!
PEOPLE ONLY CARE ABOUT WHAT IS IN IT FOR THEM AND THEIR BUSINESS. if you can't give a legitimate business reason for a business to try bitcoin, they will continue to ignore you.

i know we love to pump up good news, but if you are still going to the atm every time you need to go to the store you're doing basic life very wrong. it's still significantly easier to just go to wal-mart and buy what i want and use my cash/cc/debit that i already have than to go buy a gift card every time i need to go shopping.

Answer the question then. It's really easy. Who loses in a trade when I sell a $700 investment for $4k to someone who then sells it for $10k? And that person sells it for $20k? And that person buys a car with it when the value is $50k? Who lost here?
Stop with the lecturing and answer a simple question. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:11:28
I can easily disagree and this mindset is more of a problem with the community than with bitcoin or any investable asset.
I recently sold some coins around $4k. My const basis is in the triple digits. I made a healthy profit. I won. Maybe the person who now holds my coins will sell them in a year for $10k. They made a healthy profit. They won.
Traders have no connection to each other. I can win my trade no matter what happens with your trade, and vice versa.
If the above is your mindset that says more about you than it does about what you're trading. McAfee is a pirate and an asshole that thinks the only way he can win is by someone else losing. That's his problem, not anyone taking the other side of his trade.
