MtGox was a great place to store my BTC. It was so secure that no one could get to the coins!

Someday may be tomorrow or it may be the future. But someday is not today. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 18:41:56
And yet we will never know where my coins went....
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:49
At one point no one could figure out how to withdrawal lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:18
I was in gox when it went down :(

I’ve been doing that exact same thing since about March of this year. I sold at 13k to get back all that I had invested with still 2/3rds of my coins left. Have been waiting for it to drop back below 13k to start buying again. I was buying every Tuesday at 5pm pst no matter the price until it hit 10k. 
It takes all emotion out of it and if you’re only putting a small amount in each week that you would’ve spent elsewhere. It’s a win win with very little stress on your life.

I think you bought my coins ����

Maybe take out a few characters or so. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:01:02
Yeah, figured they'd have a lot more free time now. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:09:24
these are the type of comments that are negative to the BTC community as a whole.
Mt Gox dying and disapearing wont help BTC at all. Yet it would hurt it as a whole and lose alot of trust in the economy.
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:58:24
Ok. So what can the bitcoin community do then?
Sit on their thumbs and twiddle there fingers saying "oh well we got fucked"
@_date: 2014-01-28 02:54:34
just an every day mother fucker.
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:48:00
Will OP deliver?
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:34:03
To the top. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:08:03
I'm right there with you.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:46:34
yeah you guys hang out on the weekends? play some croquet? 
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:22:55
Lol why is he downvoted for giving to another member. Get off his nuts!
@_date: 2014-01-22 20:21:46
It's called taking a shit. I give reddit 5 minutes and whipping my ass 1 minute. 6 minutes out of my busy day, compared to hours of research and creating a hypothesis.
@_date: 2014-01-18 15:34:08
Because $1000/BTC is a great price to buy at if you estimate $10k/40k in 5-10 years. That's a big gain. 
It's much like buying when BTC was sub $100 and selling at $1100. 
Long term these prices are a great buy. Short term you're in for a ride.

Step Four is always profit. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:30:57
So what do you propose the Bitcoin community to do as a whole to take care of this Mtgox/Mark problem. Seems like you want us to handle this all in-house....
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:22:40
I enjoy buying BTC today only to have the price drop more than 30% in value in 4 business days. 
Why would want to lose 30% of my investment before I can even have access to it. 
Coinbase will either be phased out by user that understand this or will have to change their policies even more to adapt to people that don't want to lose a huge portion of their investments the day they purchase. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:18:11
Weird Mark told me the same thing.....
@_date: 2016-01-16 01:08:46
Is MT GOX still the best place to do trading?
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:04:39
If so.... some of those were my coins lol
@_date: 2016-06-10 20:51:36
I hope so he owes me a lot of BTC!
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:51:31
Yeah no idea of what's going on. Been in BTC over 2 years.....
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:52:12
I’m still holding mine too. They are on MTGox. Nice and safe so I won’t sell them.

Question I have is how does he pay income tax on bitcoins?
Litterally how will he pay his income tax? Who will the IRS come after for tax evasion the city or the person?
Will they tax him on how much his bit coins are worth when paid or how many he accumulated over the year?
How will he pay taxes on the amount of money he makes if bit coin only goes up and he makes profit, he has to pay taxes on that as well. 
This guy could end up losing either a lot of money in taxes or could out right go to jail when audited on his taxes. 
Had this discussion with a friend about this guy earlier so if someone could answer would help!

I couldn't find it in coinbase. They only buy options at set price is why I asked. 
I know what I need to know just don't have the time to search all the exchanges for the feature I need unless it's right infront of me and I'm not seeing it or isn't offered on their mobile sites. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:45:21
Thanks I will check it out and use your link. 
What's the easiest and quickest way to start (fund the account) trading through CBX?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:06:59
And now we learned something. Recommend a good US accessible exchange? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:35:22
.04 BTC final offer. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:33:12
Seeing how you mentioned it. Which exchanges have the smallest fees?
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:37:07
I'm sure the government had a hand in it. 
Paying off interest with monopoly money doesn't always fly in the FEDs eyes.
