bitcoin is a pyramid scheme that is going to crash due to legislation.
Whoever is investing in it (at this point) is fucking retarded.

I'm sorry? I don't understand your usage of "fiat".

Okay, no. You do not have the right to do whatever. You're confusing your own personal definition of "rights" with the lawful definition of "rights".

You seem to be conflating "will" with "right".
We absolutely have the willpower to make bad decisions. We do not have the right to do so; that is why it's illegal.

Yes, while using the legal definition of the word "rights", as described in the constitution. 
If you wish to subscribe to some magical belief that you don't have to obey any laws because you have "the right" to do whatever you want, you're insane.
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:38:05


No, that is not a basic human right.
You cannot pay someone to break the law.
