who knows? I just said they might be charging a flat fee like $2 per transaction and then another fee of 1.5% or something
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:50:32
Think it's because I am using armory and bitcoind?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:40:34
They're bloated with crap you don't want or need most times. Airbitz even has pop up ads when you launch a website from their app. It's all cluttered and not needed most of the time. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:44:58
I think bitgo was designed to stop petty fraud ... Not from being outright hacked 
@_date: 2016-08-31 01:44:02
how is that dicey? You have a seed just like any other wallet. Put in the 12 words and you're good. I think it's what? BIP32? ... no... its not dicey...
@_date: 2016-08-21 01:37:13
Why would you pay that? Morrex in QC would be cheaper :p quadriga is better too

I heard the guys behind bylls are working to bring us a CAD card but only through Reddit they haven't posted anything as far as I know 
@_date: 2016-08-21 05:01:56
Oh that's an ATM. If so I think that's a steal ... The ATMs here in Montreal are robbery 
@_date: 2016-08-30 15:01:59
Hardware wallets negate that rule. Fast , simple access to bitcoin otherwise in cold storage 
@_date: 2016-08-18 22:20:40
They are state hackers infiltrating bitcoin ... Can't you tell? :)
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:56:14
I've been downloading armory on my netbook for a week now and it's only 54% lol I don't know why it's taking so long ...
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:19:22
Airbitz is pretty aggressive when it comes to market. Anyway, their wallet is bloated, slow and ugly. Plus it has ads 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:53:27
As opposed to fake Bitcoiners eh... Lol you elitest fuck
@_date: 2016-08-21 01:38:27
Probably a fixed amount under a certain price which wasn't met on the $5 purchase

Yeah the font is too everywhere
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:12:19
The best wallets for Android are mycelium and now bread wallet. Copay and bread wallet for Apple. Some people like clients like jaxx and airbitz but they are not so great... 
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:14:01
Sounded decent. Apparently they want us to be able to receive our pay cheque via this card
@_date: 2016-08-21 03:04:13
I bet you it's something like $1 or so + a percentage. It's true that they are taking on some measure of risk when processing through paypal but at the same time, it's $5. The risk on that transaction is pretty minimal. Why do you think btcoin only deals in small increments? interac has a similar level of risk as paypal, believe it or not. Most companies should be able to absorb a $5 without going bust.

couldn't you open some instant channels to a couple exchanges and act as arbitrage? doesnt have to be micro payments.

@_date: 2017-02-23 01:56:45
Very dead. Those interested in privacy should support Samourai wallet instead. I accidentally donated $140 in bitcoin to them but they gave it back! Using some weird tunnel transaction too it was fun to look at on blockseer. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:04:41
Not the same.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:03:40
Yeah it's too bad. Reusable payment channels are cool too though 
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:49:51
Which alternative do you suggest?
@_date: 2017-02-23 02:04:29
That only proves you sent bitcoin to an address. It doesn't prove that the wallet you recovered is the one we can see in the blockchain. Just curious, but why do you leave so much dust laying around? Are you not using your wallets "Max" command? =)
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:20:55
Is there one that does this for us?
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:04:45
Isn't dark wallet still around? And there's Samourai wallet too. Plus mycelium is getting a coinjoin
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:19:02
 or buybit for Canada
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:17:49
it's easy to tell if an account got hacked. What more than likely happened is you went crazy gambling and lost more than you would like so you're trying to recoup some funds
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:33:35
from what it feels, it's mostly the same on a lot of things because they never lowered it when the dollar was highl!!! ugh..   but electronics and a few other things have indeed gone up in price
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:52:51
unless you use a block chain wallet. your info is bouncing off servers (ie. electrum)
@_date: 2016-06-30 00:04:10
which only goes to show you ... no one has any idea what's going on
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:16:38
why would someone steal your stuff to gamble? even if they won the gambling place wouldn't pay them out 
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:17:14
it wasn't showing up for me until i searched for cicle pay. :) It's working fine here in Quebec. Even got to update my rating 
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:01:00
Yeah it does search for circle pay
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:38:25
You can try the voucher from any esso
@_date: 2016-06-11 17:37:56
not officially but it works for me in Canada. of course it's just the bitcoin stuff not the email payment stuff. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:25:02
they hold your coin for 2-3 days the first time you buy... they do security checks i guess 
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:49:03
Bip 91 ensures miners good behavior. We're mostly fine now.

When are you going to offer a CAD card?
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:53:34
Looks like they are using an old ww2 bunker. Which was readily available and easy to convert I'm sure 
@_date: 2016-11-02 03:45:21
In new York most of those buttons don't do anything for cross lights lol 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:31:18
if the blocks are full it can matter. your low fees are taking the place of higher fees from someone else. you're paying, just not as much. It matters.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:21:30
They probably got swamped with emails from the bitfinex thing messing up their rates.

Wonky GUI makes it feel cheap 
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:38:24
Bitcoin itself can be laundered and quite easily. Say you went on the dark web and bought yourself 100 BTC for half price. It's cheaper because the coins were stolen and are tainted. Take that coin and move it into low-kyc places ... Go from let's say gambling sites to places like poloniex then to btce then finally you can move it to a clean exchange and sell for fiat. Easy peasy. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 02:07:38
Places like bovada and bet 365 are huge
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:16:43
Keepkey doesn't even offer their product for any crypto-currency purchase on their site. What kind of company does that? Multibit is a huge pile of shit too. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:57:15
 Bitpay is just a fork of copay

Go look at their block chain with a block chain explorer. Tell me if you can find it. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:18:27
Why would you apply to a third party for help with your passport? It’s not complicated. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:39:25
Just not the hardware that runs it. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:22:22
Trezor is open sourced. Ledger is not. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:15:59

it's just kind of in the article ... 
@_date: 2016-05-27 04:36:53
i like my ledger unplugged... it keeps my keys off the internet and  otherwise uses mycelium ... the encryption methods are pretty clever too. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:34:35
Even if you pay yourself you loose money from potential fees you aren't mining 
@_date: 2016-05-22 04:53:31
be careful with circle as they sold me .2 btc then held it for a week. fastest way is bitcoin ATM ....
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:24:55
Use copay and integrate it with coinbase... Then it is possible yes 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:07:36
Just the smart money collecting their dues. BIP141 is when the real liftoff happens. This was just moving the ship to the launch pad
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:42:39
blockchain.info is a web wallet. How can you own your private keys if they're being stored on their servers? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:29:04
yes but their verification can't be trusted because nodes are vulnerable to sybil attacks. So are they really verifying blocks if miners are there to prevent against a node-based attack on the chain? no. they aren't. they're propagating blocks. the miners are doing the real security because hash power is the msot trustworthy thing we have. miners are incentive to stay honest because they are heavily invested in the health of the coin! Of course, we learnt that if their position is threatened they will do everything they can to prevent it, such as the threat of side-chains. Satoshi consensus is a tricky thing. To say it's this or that as fact is not a good thing. We can discuss the philosophy behind it, and universities probably will, for years
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:09:35
old news you can fund it but the ability to request a payout is still sort of new. this also must mean the company is hodling coin which is great news for everyone! ��
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:50:04
It already trusts someone else's validation and that's the miners. The nodes propagate blocks across the network and 'seed' the ledger. This is their job. Miners time-stamp and ensure that the nodes behave.
@_date: 2017-07-11 02:52:12
Interac only works if you have an unbranded cc. Coinsquare.io still has interac e transfer
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:03:16
It says they keep it on their server in the link you pasted!!! They keep your private keys, encrypted on their server. Read it for yourself you dumb shit
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:11:14
it's much harder to reverse prepaid card purchases.
@_date: 2017-05-20 02:53:50
Nodes only propogate validated blocks. Miners validate.

@_date: 2017-07-27 17:45:18
They store your private keys on their server. Says so right there. You should probably educate yourself more on wallets because everyone knows blockchain.info is a shitty wallet and it's web based. At least bit go uses multi sig
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:34:54
I disagree. Nodes are following the rules and miners are the ones enforcing it. I can't trust your node, bro and you can't trust mine. Miners ALSO resolve conflicting transactions by time-stamping the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:44:12
I have. Sounds like you need to do some work
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:01:28
just to add onto this ... Nodes CAN try to enforce the rules, such as with UASF. It's a dangerous thing to the health of bitcoin though and even nullc opposed it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:04:54
It's plausible this is in relation to the dark web being brought down. Tumblers are disruptive.
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:35:30
It's kinda neat actually

But not without hash rate

"Your encrypted wallet is automatically backed up to our servers. To safely store your wallet, we add another layer of security by encrypting your wallet a second time. Securely storing your wallet on our servers ensures that you can access your wallet from any (and all) of your different devices."
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:37:54
I'm pretty sure that alphabay and friends had bitcoin tumblers which tumbled a lot of bitcoin. This created spam. I don't think that there is a huge market for dark market stuff, just that the accompanying coinjoins and mixing clouds spammed us to death. One by one, these markets are closing down. People don't trust tumblers anymore because they're mostly useless. These tumblers being closed reduced spam ...
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:01:42
Bitcoin is the longest chain though. Miners make the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:42:54
They aren't the same. Trezor uses open source firmware and hardware. Ledger does not.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:16:05
Yeah it does. It says they keep them encrypted on their server. It's a web wallet bro. That's how they work. They're holding your keys.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:34:15
Nodes are validating blocks which have already been validated. They're mostly just propagating.
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:19:41
Samourai is BIP148 compatible
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:11:19
i thought that unless the wallet supports multiple wallets that doing so could risk the loss of your coin?
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:32:39
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:10:52
Yeah I don't get why this bullshit wallet has so much traction. It's a disaster waiting to happen for Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-03 04:13:59
Canada is not included. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:38:27
Yeah I do. The link is still there it's just made difficult to see. Computers can still track that shit buddy. Even the newer mixers who combine everyone's shit in one big transaction. Plus the guy just got robbed! 
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:46:30
Android security has stepped it up quite a bit since marshmallow. both are fine. all the same, i air gapped my coin on a ledger unplugged 
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:18:35
No idea man 
@_date: 2016-07-24 14:26:02
I think the standard response to cloud mining is ... It's a scam! sorry buddy :(
@_date: 2016-07-09 01:45:26
would still be less than a mixing service :) but yeah the exchanges/gambling sites is the best bet really....
@_date: 2016-07-09 00:12:56
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:49:10
I heard there is a way to lose your coin by doing this if the wallet doesn't support it. Electrum supports this but I don't know about mycelium.
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:24:40
mixing doesn't even work. why not just transfer from one exchange to another to another? or turn your coin into eth then back into btc? so many things could have been done differently. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:58:47
most wallets (SPV wallets like breadwallet and bitcoin wallet are exceptions) connect to centralized nodes to have their transactions broadcast. these are places companies like chain analysis targets for IP netting. if you use your own node you can avoid that. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:11:17
Oh and the relation is that ledger is okay selling products that don't really work well ... :/ I'm pretty upset about that. I wasted a good $60 on this stupid card that ended up trapping my coin when I needed them fast

Bitpay is good. They have some of the best developers in the business and their copay wallet is open source
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:09:41
If firmware and hardware are open source, you don't have to trust nearly so much though.
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:03:13
I'm done. This ad thing was the last straw. These guys are some shitty business people. Hope breadwallet takes over.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:16:00
Mycelium has rbf and cpfp actually. So not sure what this is about
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:41:12
Bitcoin was used for illegal means years ago. The privacy has since been nullified so people switched to dark coins like zcash instead. Unless you run a private full node, assume your wallets are being watched and you're ip is being attached to transactions. Assume zero privacy
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:39:35
Actually they did it themselves for a while and only switched to bitpay later on.

@_date: 2017-06-28 03:44:20
Trezor has open source firmware and hardware. This makes it trust less. Ledger has proprietary hardware with closed firmware. You have to trust ledger. Which isn't too bad they seem like swell guys. Except for selling me an unplugged which can't handle more than 0.1 at a time without failing
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:13:56
Yes they do
@_date: 2017-06-28 11:36:24
i see now. they only support showing you there was a RBF and cpfp is not 'hidden' ... its just how mycelium wallet works... This statement is still incorrect though. GreenAddress has RBF too eh?

@_date: 2017-06-25 22:44:20
why would anyone want to use a third party wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:17:05
Never reuse  that. Private key has been exposed. Risky
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:07:33
Yes. Stupid. For one you assume Core controls bitcoin so that's the first indication that you're a stupidio. Secondly, all core has to do is implement the code from segwit2x into their client, which isn't very much. Really, you just have no idea about anything and you should probably comment less and read more.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:58:17
Uh it's all open source, stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:33:17
Also expensive as fuck and not really practical for 99% of hodlers
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:15:36
Nawh. Value is swollen because it's being used as a test for BTC. Ltc is kind of a shallow clone of bitcoin with different mining algo
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:13:17
it is still traceable. the only way to kill the connection is to alt coin it up ... or move it from exchange to exchange before going to your wallet
