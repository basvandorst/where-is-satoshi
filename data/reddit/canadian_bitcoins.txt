We've had several companies big and small having to deal with ransomware. We've even had some come to us on more than one occasion because they didn't take precautions after being hit the first time. I would agree with EonShiKeno, make a proper back up to protect your data, and do it often. Also educate your staff on this threat and make sure they are aware of the ways you can get hit by it. Knowing on what not to click on is knowledge worth having.

We did advertise, and I would have to say that MillyBitcoin might be right. The cost for advertising was to much for us verse what it was generating. I also think that allgoodthings1 is also right, from what I see most of the exchanges and brokerages post on here if they have something to announce, or if they want to see what people are saying about them and getting to reply. The reach is far greater, and targeted to the specific market they want to reach, and talk to, at zero the cost. Well outside of having someone monitor Reddit to post replies to comments or make posts.

As someone noted below there is the CAVirtex exchange. They operate on the week-ends. I'm not sure of Circle's hours of operation. As a Brokerage we are directly buying and selling to our Clients not facilitating an exchange, so yes our prices shown are different then them but our prices is what you see, we do not take a percentage off of every exchange, so at times our prices can be better so its always good to watch all prices.
As for opening a location in Toronto, no we are not looking to expand at the moment, It would be nice, but its not something we are looking at right now. I do know that there is a Bitcoin ATM on King street near Spadina. and there are a few others I think. Though I do believe for all of them their access is restricted to the times the places they are located are open.

Hi, I just thought I would reply to  your post. As detailed on our site. We do not guarantee rates outside of cash through express mail (24 hours) and cash in person at our office (3 hours) any other way is processed at the current rate when completed during normal business hours Monday to Friday 9 to 5 EST. On Mondays we go through all emails checking them for any issues before completing all orders that have come in over the week-end, thus why your order was completed about 45 minutes after we opened. If there is an issue with an order someone has emailed about we need to address it before we complete it and send the BTC as once sent we do not have a way to reverse the transaction.

Hi, you can always come into our office (in Ottawa) to buy Bitcoins, or place an order online at canadianbitcoins.com We are a Brokerage that buys and sells Bitcoins and Litecoins. When you look at the price on our site, its that price all our fees/cost are already in the price, nothing is added on once you go to complete your order. Our price wont be the same as the exchanges as our price is influenced by our actual inventory as we are buying and selling not facilitating trades amongst others on our site.
Take a look at our site, hopefully you might like it more than the Bitcoin ATMs

The key is what is the situation of that $100 to $300. Is that the amount you are willing to invest and feel comfortable, then yes. You should never put in more than you can afford to loose. Crypto is a roller coaster of ups and downs, fortunes have been made and lost.

We have had people contact us about being scammed this way. If it goes like others, once you have sent the Bitcoin the check will come back NSF. You'll be on the hook for the amount of the bounced cheque, and have no means to recover the BTC.

Great list of charities to donate to! the ones that came to mind are already on the list, but one, and its Pathway to Education. They are active in low income communities working to keep children in school and help them graduate high school and hopefully get  a post secondary education too. 
 
For the others that came to mind I'll say them again. United Way, The Water Project

Didn't they announce that people were to make sure they had default wallet addresses in the user preference section and to then email someone specific detailed in the post. I presume they will be transferring out BTC and LTC to those wallets as people get that set up?

Moxipay has a loading fee of 3% on their end to send money to your Moxipay account. But when you are buying from us with either Interac Online or Mozipay there is no additional fee, it built into to price you see displayed.

So that can be a tricky answer, I would never bash anyone or anything to make us look better, we are what were are and they are what they are. I can say how we are different (on what I know). On one had we allow up to $500 for a Transaction in a 24 hour period.  as for a % in what our cost is. It fluctuates based on our supply and demand and our inventory plus BTC stability. We are a brokerage so we are buying and selling directly. Looking at our past % it seems to float between 3 and 5%. But that can change based on all the above mentioned factors. As in buying anything I would suggest looking at what current prices are and always pick the best one. If that is us at the time then great, we look forward to your business. 
I hope that answers your question
