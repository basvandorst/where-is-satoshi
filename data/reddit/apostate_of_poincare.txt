Well thanks for the breifing; and well met, sir.

This clears up most of what I was having difficulties with.  But how do you determine whether "the community as a whole reject[s]" it?  What if you get an (more-or-less) even split?

I know it's decentralized... my question was rhetorical.

Er... so who's the 'president' of bitcoins?
(edit: for the less observant: I was pointing out the flaw in well_met_sirs analogy in order to prompt a better explanation, not sincerely asking who the president was)

Huh.  I thought it was for n00bs who didn't know any better...

Ah, ok, so bitcoin is still going to be a around for a while despite pirate's actions?  I guess I kind of that pirate was the creator/manager of bitcoins and took the whole thing down.
I don't want to create a wiki (I'm too ignorant about bitcoins) I've just never looked really deeply into bitcoins until I was clicking random subreddits the other day and the top three threads were about pirate's ponzi scheme.
Killhamster's response kind of linguistically affirmed what I said but had the attitude "who cares?" so I was confused.
