Not if you're cheap on fees. Which is what he's saying.
 
It can be fast if you pay the price right now...So you have to pick.
Cheap and slow
Expensive and fast

You're thinking about it wrong.  
Not giving advice one way or another but if bitcoin decided tomorrow that the standard unit of measure was now going to be 1/100,000th of what a bitcoin is currently 1 BTC would be $0.13.
The actual *value* of the Bitcoin didn't change.  It's trading value and purchasing value would still be the same.  You just changed the standard unit of measure.
What's important is what you see the future value being.  Is it going to increase at a rate that outpaces BTC?  Recently there have been very few altcoins that have been able to do that.

Yup, my TD card has Interac but with a Visa logo and didn't work.
My credit union card had Interac without any credit card logo and worked fine... until my credit union got tired of my e-transfering money repeatedly from TD just to spend on bitcoin and froze my account.

Na i get it, i kept a $0 balance in that account and was only open because it wasn't worth it to drive back to my hometown to officially close it out.

I have no doubt it will scale eventually. It will probably have lost the market dominance by the time it does so.
Other than first movers advantage why would anyone use bitcoin over ripple/lumens/dash? Fuck bch, they've done scaling in a way that had none of the advantages of btc but still doesn't match many alts in speed and fees.
 
BTC is still 50%+ of my portfolio but every day I can't help but think of how bloated and useless it is right now. I think if more alts were able to be purchased directly with fiat btc would lose a lot of it's utility and I would hold less.

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:28:19
Yup, and why would they.  Bitcoin does not function as a currency right now.  We need to sort our shit out... and honestly it needs to be done quickly with how much momentum and widespread publicity BTC is gaining currently.

It's hard too, I feel like a lot of the Altcoins get traded behind insider information.  A big partnership announcement incoming?  Watch the price go to the moon.
Bought some Stellar Lumens on Dec 1st based on me liking the technology behind it and they're up 110% since then.  Why?  They announced a partnership with GOPAX KR last night... but the value was already starting to skyrocket yesterday afternoon.
They also have a conference which it's expected more will be announced, but we'll see I guess.  I have no idea.

I've been waiting with an open ticket since Nov 10th when my basic verification failed.
My initial mistake in that my license says Michael but i wrote my name is as Mike.  But over a month (and counting) to resolve is a little ridiculous.

Ya, i guess i mean it doesn't work for any point of sale transactions.

And it's too bad because the community mimics him.  I'm open minded... I own quite a few crypto currencies and don't think BTC is the be all end all.  I think to be naive enough to think that an alternate crypto isn't going to surpass bitcoin at some point to be a true transactional currency is a huge mistake.
I went over to to try to learn a bit about Bcash to see if it was worth putting money into.  It's very hard to find any actual information on Bcash because the entire sub is dedicated to bashing BTC, which as I said is very reflective of Roger.  They don't talk about their own product at all.

"You have $100 worth of BTC. So you purchase an item for $66, but have to pay a $17 fee. Now you have $17 worth of Bitcoin left, but it costs $17 more to move it. So $66 item effectively cost you $100.  BlockStream"

Quadriga (one of the prominent Canadian exchanges) is business as usual.
During the mayhem yesterday it took a few more seconds than usual to post an order, or cancel a posted order, which by that time the goalposts may have been moved or an order you no longer wanted may have been filled.  But that's the reality of a market like that getting slammed by way higher than normal volumes of trading.

I think you're overvaluing it being something that everyone NEEDS to know about. 
I agree that it is going to function as a store of wealth compared to an actual transact-able currency.  But ask a random person what the current price of gold is.  It's not anything someone in the first world NEEDS to be educated about.

What exactly did I "rob"?  It's a very recognizable quote from a once extremely popular HBO show.  Do I need to do this shit to appease internet trolls?

Man i don't know the fact that they were subpoenaed on Dec 6th but have printed an additional $1.4B since that time makes me thing they're more than likely legit.  Knowing they're going to be under scrutiny but still more than doubling their reserve doesn't seem like something a shady company would do.
