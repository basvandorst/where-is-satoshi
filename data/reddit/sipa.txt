[here]( is explained how bitcoin transactions work. Essentially everytime you transfer bitcoins, stuff is added to the block. And if blocksize limit is enforced, it eventually means, some bitcoins can't be transferred anymore, making them practically worthless. It's like having money, but you can't take it out of your wallet.

Blocksize limit effectively makes some blocks null after certain amount of transactions, because you cannot write any more transaction to that block. Analoguous to SSD storage that has finite write cycles, when those are used up you still can read what's in it, but you just cant change it anymore. It's same deal here, but in the case of BTC 1MB blocksize limit is artificial limit, that could be changed.

It's relevant in sense that this explains how block size limit actually works, and it shows that it doesn't work as production quota. Instead it's a limit on how many times that decoded currency can be used, before becoming useless. So the blocksize limit just transforms bitcoins into hotpotatos and the unlucky person who receives it when limit is reached is paid with worthless bitcoins.

I think it's important context to the discussion, which could be missed if things aren't understood.

Do your research, and figure out what is handle of which person, by clicking your mention of me, it should be quite evident that you're referring a different user you're meaning to.
I mean I could be a dick and come here and say stuff that you'd take like from an authority, but that's not who I want to be, so I'll just be a condecending prick and say it would take just 2min tops to figure out the nickname you really want to mention. First hint: google it up. Zero point hint: it's same as that person's twitter handle.
Have a nice day.

I've mined litecoin about 3 years ago, and got free gpu out of it. But I haven't ever been active in forums on the topic, I just happen to share handle with someone famous \^\^ first few times this happened i didn't get it and answered some questions, because i thought it was one friend of mine pinging me, but then i did some research. Found out that guy was same I've been "fighting" with over nickname on ircnet, was pretty funny. Contacted him to query if he had reddit account so i could redirect stuff clearly meant for him.
