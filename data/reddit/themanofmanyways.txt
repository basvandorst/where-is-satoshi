Not necessarily. Gold is pretty useless tbh. It's only valuable because people think it's valuable. Cryptocurrencies might be the same. It could become a crypto-asset (which several countries actually count it as) if it survives long enough and gains enough adopters.

Disagree. It's too volatile to serve as proper money (at least for now). Traditional fiat actually serves better as money IMO. It's just that the financial system around it is inefficient and crony.
Also what if Bitcoin fizzles out or is replaced by a new/better cryptocurrency or even means of making payments?

The demand for it for those things is far from enough to support its price. Its historical reputation as a safe haven asset contributes significantly to its value. And if bitcoin should survive for long enough and gain widespread adoption, it will likely be the same.

Hence why I said "for now". 


Technological prowess =/= good as a form of money. Using my visacard is significantly easier in transactions than Bitcoin. Maybe that'll change in future, but for now, it isn't so great to use as money.

Okay. My point, though, is that there is the possibility of other cryptocurrencies solving the problems bitcoin suffers from and gaining popularity.
