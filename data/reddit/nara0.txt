When you say double spend. That means if I sent 20 bucks I would need to send another 20 bucks with double the normal fee to have both picked up? Would that be correct....please forgive my noobness

Downloaded a new electrum and have upped the fees and added in the option for RBF. Since I didn't have those options before sending I feel like I may be SOL and just have to wait / hope this transaction comes back to me. Now Electrum has at least updated the transaction in the history log as "Low Fee".

Some miner must have had mercy on my soul and mined the the btc about 2 hours ago. I have updated my wallets so I will be giving the properly deserved amount for those wonderful miners out there helping me move from A to B. Thank you so much for your detailed explanation. That has helped me understand a heck of a lot more about BTC than I ever did before. Thank you ALL so so much for all of your help! I was really sweating bullets until the reddit cavalry came to my aide. Thank you thank you thank you all!!!!!!!!

Thank you! That helps give me some peace I'm over 72 hours now still unconfirmed. I tried useing   where it did accept my tx ID but nothing has moved since. I will try sending another small amount with a higher price to the same place and see if that helps them get picked up quicker. Thank you again for all of your help!

I did have dynamic fees enabled. The fee I sent was " 0.000096 BTC " which obviously wasn't enough. I can't seem to figure out the Child Pays for parents route. Nor is trying to use the VIAbtc accelerator working. Pushing 96 hours with no confirmations.

Well then crap that is not the problem. Hopefully it will come home soon so I can send it back out. Thank you for the help sir! ( I was convincing myself that was the issue)

I used the fee that electrum recommended. I think part of the problem is that right after I got my amount the bitcoin price went up 200$. Even made a small deposit to send to the same address with a bigger fee hoping to get both picked up. No dice. I was trying to do a child pay for parent setup but obviously missed something. Second payment sent went through in under 30 minutes :/

I have this exact issue with circle. I made an account on 5 Days ago and have not been able to transfer BTC out of my account. Only see the message "We are unable to honor this at this time". Have sent in 2 support emails asking what's up and haven't heard a word from them. This is a pain in the ass

Yes! I ended up having to call support. They hadn't "authorized my account yet" which took all of 5 seconds and was good to go. Hope you got yourself squared away already! Sorry for the late reply.
