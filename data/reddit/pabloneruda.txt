It's a lecture, so I guess you could skip around, but I'd really recommend the whole thing since they build off each other.  Took me about 2 weeks of watching at night.
But if you made me pick: 
All of section 2 + 3 + 4 is required reading.  You have to know how this stuff works.  I understood the general ideas before but this really gets down and dirty.  Learning about how keys are generated I found super interesting.
5.4-5.5 Mining incentives and strategies was good to know the mechanics of how pools work.
6.5 is super relevant right now as we're watching momentum gain for Monero/ZCash.
8.1-8.5 is important since we're seeing a lot of altcoins gaining traction which use alternate PoW schemes or PoS.
I really enjoyed the whole history on Altcoins.  Some great stories in there, miners battling new altcoins, implosions, etc.

It's heavily math/cs based.  Without a background you may not understand some of the data structures they refer to.  
However, even if you don't understand that part of the course you will still get a ton out of it.

We’ll see if the math holds up for 2018

Why are those that lost BTC not getting a portion of that BTC back?  No reason to turn it to fiat

How come his lawyer couldn't argue Section 230?

How come the gox'd customers just didn't get BTC back?  That's what they wanted anyways. 
And who's watching the lawyers for insider trading?

That is the dumbest statement I've heard

This is why we need stricter penalties that \_exceed\_ the gains made by illegal activities.
