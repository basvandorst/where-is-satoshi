You could do what I do, and hang out in r/science and answer questions where appropriate...
Three Comments on your site:
1) You shouldn't require me to log in to see the paper you have on the front page, in a readable size. 
2) Individual items should lead to a page dedicated to them, where they are shown in a larger format. Think the free PDF set up you find on Pubmed; your cancer research is fascinating, and I'm sure you did something cool with mTor, but I'm not going to read it if it's physically too small to read. 
3) You should make it a requirement that posts be layman friendly. I know what mTor is, but I have a degree in biochemistry.... If you want to reach the non-scientist audience, you gotta make sure they understand it. Remember what Rutherford said, 'A theory you can't explain to a bartender is probably no damn good.'
Hope this pans out for ya Professor Peterson.

NIH funding is getting hard to get, but you are correct and raise some good points they should address.

Not sure how true it is, I use CampBX, but I heard that it's incredibly difficult to get money out of MtGox so prices are higher to deal with that risk.

Pardon my ignorance, but I thought I heard that mBTC were known as Satoshi? 
1mBTC= 1 Satoshi? Or is that not correct...?
