they have their own lightning network? :D
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:20:07
When the network is developed and in full use, how we will find the path from the sending to the receiving nodes?

Do you know how we should be able to find a path to a node across the network when the LN is fully developed?

How do we find the route from the sending node to the receiving one?

It was probably a tiny percentage of the guy's portfolio. Or he is very very very rich now or he sold it all for a small value. The pizzas are irelevant for him in any case

i dont get the point of visiting this subreddit just to throw hate around

the great gold advantage it is to be something physical, something "real" that during a world collapse, wars, etc its believed to remain valuable. If you want to have something on the internet bitcoin is better

i posted the exact same article 10 days ago and didnt made the top page...
the same way, someday bitcoin will go mainstream for no apparent reason (we have it all to do it today!) and we'll be like "i knew it a long time ago!!!"

Since bitcoin is something new, people question it in ways they dont do with fiat currencies. If they think about fiat currencies they will figure out bitcoin its just like them (but better)

the article argues that the payment system - the possibility to send and receive money anywhere, instantly, easily and for free - is what gives bitcoin its value

I dont know if it`s hard to do it, but maybe there could be a correct way to open, so if someone open it wrongly it would rip the paper and made it unusuable. It would be a protection.
Of course the user would have to have another copy or be very sure not to forget about this

I don't think a little variance is a problem for a stable coin. Saying it has collateral and not allowing serious auditing it is

They should only destroy it when someone redeems their tokens in usd. Who did it? Themselves?
If they destroy it without the redeem it means there were no 1:1 pegging, which is a problem

"politics" was a bad word. I mean all the SegWit2x debate and accusations that X or Y group wants to destroy bitcoin.
I mean, no one is concerned about improving bitcoin or making it more accepted by merchants, just about criticizing other people
