Two, but it has to be a really big light bulb.

I'm new around here and haven't read the counterarguments.  Can you help a bro with a link or two?
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:38:12
Did they deliver your product yet?

And if we stay quiet and pretend the difficulties don't exist, nobody will figure it out on their own?  How will we solve the problems if we don't share observations and propose solutions?
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:44:10
Wow, thanks for the feedback, folks.  The  impression I'm getting  is that they're  slow to ship, but not malicious.  I left them a voicemail and email requesting an estimated shipping date.  Will post again when I get a reply, in case anyone's interested.

Right, I think the time limits encourage turnover in the parking place so fresh customers can be accommodated, this increasing local retail revenue.

I don't get that.  If the machines have the super-high ROI that they seem to, they'd be better off mining the coins themselves with the rig you paid for.    What am I missing?
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:56:35
IANAL, so I'm not exactly sure what constitutes fraud.  But stating "we're shipping" when they so obviously are not - with the obvious intent of calming the restless and driving new orders - if that isn't fraud, what is it, exactly?  
 
@_date: 2013-05-27 21:32:44
OK, thanks.  Investing in ASICMINER doesn't really help with decentralization, though, does it?
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:33:03
You're OK with the wait?

I'm new to BitCoin, so if I'm misunderstanding how it works, please feel free to correct me.  Doesn't the entire BitCoin system depend on miners to verify all transactions?    It seems BitCoin's attractiveness as a medium of exchange depends on timely verification of transactions.  if a large enough number of miners were intimidated by the money-transmitter designation such that verification could not be obtained in predictable amount of time, BitCoin could go dead.  Therefore, couldn't designating miners MSBs prove fatal to Bitcoin?

Awesome -- by then the photo and well-wishes will be worth more than the single!  Thanks, bro!

Me, too.  I realized, belatedly, that their business model makes no sense as advertised.  Its irrational to give up a cheap money-printing machine before its essentially worthless.  Still, I held onto my optimism for a while after getting the "we're shipping" email.  
But two weeks later, there should have been tons of bragging from happy new miners.  Instead, crickets.  So I got out to beat the rush. Good thing for BFL I got my money -- my next stop would have been the Kansas Attorney General.  I don't know what the legal definition of fraud is, but saying you're shipping, then not shipping, all the while holding people's money...  if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....
@_date: 2013-06-15 23:56:58
Can you link me to redditors that have received their product?  When I search r/Bitcoinmining I don't actually find any, and I'm getting baffled why anybody ever refers to BFL shipping anything at all.
@_date: 2013-06-16 03:49:46
Thanks for helping me see this from a different perspective.  If you're right, and BFL is thinking long-term, then I've maligned them unfairly.  Oh, well.  Based on the downvotes I've been getting, BFL will be fine whatever I say.  
Obviously, I suspect BFL is *not* thinking like you do, but there's really no way to tell just from debate, so I guess I'll just let it go for now.  If I'm wrong, it's good for bitcoin.  If I'm right, I'm glad I got  my refund.  Whatever, the coming year will be interesting.  Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-06-16 00:01:33
Source?  Are any of them redditors?  I just searched and turned up nobody.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:49:43
Real information rather than conjecture and innuendo!  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:13:33
Can you expand a bit?  Are you recommending them as a legitimate alternative to BFL?  If so, I would agree.  But "don't spend more than you can afford to lose"....  Block Erupters are just too pricey for me, which is how BFL was able to set the hook. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 20:02:28
I don't see any way for Bitcoin Foundation to comply.  This is like court-ordering a single guy to furnish his marriage license.  
@_date: 2013-08-21 04:24:27
This was a hoot:


trustworthy and that necessarily implies the
recognition of governments and financial institutions.    
Hilarious!  Are there any organizations that are trusted *less* than governments and financial institutions?
@_date: 2013-06-16 00:03:43
BFL is not irrational.  They will never ship the machine while the payback time is only 12 days.
@_date: 2013-06-16 00:53:43
The increase in bitcoin exchange rate only makes the ripoff more likely.  Once they've mined them, no one but BFL will ever touch them.  Lawsuit?  You'll only get dollars, of which they'll have few.  Jail?  The bitcoins will wait until they get out.  If youre right and the only thing that stops the BFL ripoff is fear of lawsuits or jail?Ponzi and Madoff feared neither.  And they didn't have the advantages over their marks that bitcoin gives BFL.
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:15:15
OK, there's reason for optimism.  But this could conceivably be an angle of attack, right?  If so, what are countermeasures?  Go underground, or - ?
