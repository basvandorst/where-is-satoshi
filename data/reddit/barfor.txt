Here's a list of charities that have accepted bitcoin for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:03
And ended aug 1.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:37:45
The debate ended. The final outcome is yet to come.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:27:25
For those that don't know, Hal Finney died August 28, 2014.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:03:00
Technically true (another hard fork not withstanding) it would require stratospheric amounts of hashing power to pull that off.
@_date: 2015-06-03 05:19:22
He clearly hasn't left yet.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:52:40
Excellent but perhaps:
"max block size = median + average size of last 288 blocks" is better.
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:13:44
Bitcoin opens your eyes to third-party fractional reserves everywhere.

My sister in law was very bad with keeping track. She had one entire paycheck go to fees. Poof, all funds to support herself, gone. She turned into a literal bank robber. Just remember kids, give the banks as little as possible to steal/confiscate/"charge" from you. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:22:17
Don't appreciate them. They stick those charges back to the innocent merchant as a "chargeback".
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:53:35
Another "expert" who thinks the blockchain is all we need.
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:48:21
So is changetip making/have a plugin or something for charities?

Wow. But their counterfeit measures are so nice! /s
@_date: 2014-12-02 02:39:54
It's a Money Transmitter license thing for each state. Some states like South Carolina have no license required.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:15:46
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:23:09
Very cool setup and idea. It sounds like you're not getting any work to hash. Maybe the pool is partially cutting you off with such a low amount hashing / consistency?
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:42:19
* On 2012-12-07 he said AAPL was ["a screaming buy"]( - price that day = 533.25
Price went only down from there, as low as 390.53, and while there is some recovery in price since that low (today its 546), hardly good investment advice.
* On 2013-01-02, he said of Facebook "way over-valued" at 25.
Proceeded to move upward and is currently more than double his price call.
* Today he says Bitcoin is "tulip-mania".
You decide.
EDIT: added fb info
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:49:52
Good explanation here: 
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:49:41
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:59:41
One reason to not use CC: ongoing massive credit card number thefts.
Yes I know "you can just call your bank to get your money back". 
Here's the problem with that thinking:
* 1) you have to go through the hassle of figuring out what happened. STRESS!
* 2) you have to call the card/bank and explain the situation. 
* 2) you may have to fax documentation supporting your claim.
* 3) you are put into a position of begging for your own money.
* 4) you may have to wait for the merchants to respond.
* 5) you may have to wait as long as 90 days for a decision to be made.
* 6) you may not "win" disputed transactions.
* 7) if you do "win" the merchant where the card/# was used now gets robbed/chargebacked and has to pay a fee for getting robbed.
* 8) Merchants raise prices to stay profitable
* 9) The frequency of these situations are well hidden from consumers.
So FYI, once you've been robbed, it still sucks: recently bought a $100 Visa gift card at grocery store. Funds were spent at a drugstore via pin before the card was opened the same day. Over a week later I'm still dealing with Giftcardmall/Visa and no "win" yet.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:28:22
South Carolina's is looking like the best so far. None.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:08:50
In the US at least, just look for any prepaid debit card with "direct deposit". They'll give you a routing # and acct # just like a regular checking account. Amex Blue does this also, no monthly fees.
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:22:32
Welcome to the wonders of Credit Cards! "Oh not to worry, the bank will cover it." Thieves think they're sticking it to the banks when in reality, the banks stick it to the merchants. Truly sorry for your loss.

They did this voluntarily but it is still creepy foreshadowing...
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:18:33
Generally to complete an onsite transaction (tx), you will need an andriod/ios and a wallet app to setup or complete a tx. (You could use a laptop but that gets awkward). Order. Open app. Tap to pay/send. Scan merchant qr code. Confirm. Done. 
As for Coinbase, they have an android app (recommended) and a third party iphone app (not recommended). You can use those or use a different wallet app entirely but you would need send some bits from coinbase to the address of your whateverapp wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-16 15:19:39
Agreed on this. You could add something like: "There may be some but ML happens with just about any currency including cash, MoneyPaks and gift cards as well."
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:51:07
I see said the blind man.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:53:54
How's the guy who sold a bunch of btc for pennies on vos feeling right now? (Although one thing that makes sense is that they were stolen bitcoins).
@_date: 2014-05-28 14:43:52
If you had backups emailed to you, (after you've listed all possible password variations and had some time to cool your head), try your password guesses on that on a seperate computer. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:56:31
On gmail it would happen off-chain.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:26:29
They already did that move - on [August 15, 1971](
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:48:45
I gave it quick read and while he focuses on a english writer, it seems predicated on a false presupposition: 1) the claim that the writers aren't known and 2) the notion that their testimony was written decades later and 3) because something is old it isn't trustworthy. Our conversation got  me thinking about the similarities of eyewitness testimony to Bitcoins's blockchain consensus.
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:46:03
Yep and lots of businesses still pay a buttload in monthly fees (gateway fees, chargeback fees, authorization fees, statement fees....) and then charge a percentage. And then a per tx fee.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:47:57
It is a bit like falling down the rabbit hole, and its difficult to see things differently once you *know* bitcoin. Don't be ever-learning, never-doing. Put your knowledge into action and you'll learn even more. So pick something that helps others the most and then take steps everyday to do it.
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:15:39
"Can you share with us some examples of uses that might have a positive impact for consumers or the broader economy? What are some of the promises of this new technology, as you see them?"
- Merchants saving credit card transactions fees and chargeback costs. Consumers saving bank fees.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:56:47
Yea was probably a talent acquisition for bitcoin processing. First Data is one of the monster sized raw payment processors. Very few of those; many gateway/processors simply resell First Data's processing.
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:36:38
So yes. Monetary supply inflation vs price inflation: too many inflation/deflation debates here go in circles without this clarity. And Paul Krugman's favorite alt, dogecoin, was a supply-inflation expirement that went as expected. Much paper.

...in the year 2140.

It's about simplicity, not tricks.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:14:34
Money transmitter regulations have very much been applied to bitcoin, thus putting up a huge wall for startups.

Feel free to pass along free bits to pass along for free.
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:50:14
Exactly. Too busy to know much about it. Too big to fail at making up an answer.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:08:27
Because 1) CurrentC is using QR codes for their payment system and 2) the retailers of CurrentC seem to hate Visa (see Walmart quote) then maybe some lobbying of CurrentC to add Bitcoin as payment rail/component is in order.
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:00:38
He's done well leading the LMOPX fund: it's up over 46% in a [year](

@_date: 2014-09-24 01:29:58
Unless they bought back at a cheaper price :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:10:48
Yea that was my first thought - he used a password/phrase to encrypt the private keys and....can't remember the correct password/phrase. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:41:43
Every state has different regulations/requirements: A MSB doing business nationwide is supposed to be licensed in every state = requirements x 50 (well 48 really as 2 states have no msb requirements).
@_date: 2014-01-31 12:36:42
He seems to be doing alright: "Carmack's engines have also been licensed for use in other influential first-person shooters such as Half-Life, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor."

@_date: 2014-01-23 16:28:10
Price has very much been consolidating, which usually leads to a big pop. Today it seems to be testing the most recent lows.
@_date: 2014-04-12 02:38:02


That is usually an indication that a person does not believe he even existed, which is part of reason I brought up Josephus. 


The operative being "good" is where we seem to disagree. While historical documentation had absolutely nothing to do with my transformation from god-hater, the veracity of testimonies is uncanny. It seems at one time you believed in God but now you see him as unjust - what happened?

A tracking number has been about the only sure way to win a dispute; perhaps PayPal is waking to the reliability of the blockchain? However, if the buyer does a chargeback with V/MC/AMEX they may not have the same view. They value tracking numbers.

When it moves that fast, mostly people who already had standing offers to sell x amount of btc for y amount of dollars. I had some orders in at 517 but the funds remained locked up until the order is filled, so there is 'opportunity cost' involved but when it goes through while you're asleep...ah its a beautiful day. :)

"I love BTC, but until recently I loved it in the privacy of my own home, at four in the morning, lurking at the bottom of r/bitcoin/new whilst watching EMA’s cross out of the corner of my eye." - I think this brought a tear to my eye. Would love to have been there.

@_date: 2014-06-05 05:38:24
Understood, its just that "have the bank reverse the charge" is one of the great misnomers. So here, eventually fiat funds get withdrawn and the "money"/cash is gone. No bank wants to be the one that eats the loss.

Can very much relate to the frustration (and DAYS of waiting) from dealing with banks' paper notes. Using "Scan-Send-Done" whenever possible brings massive efficiency to the marketplace.

Sound analysis. However, SecondMarket will win ALL the coins - I guarantee it.
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:23:36
Partially agreed. Just list everything in bits. I can easily deal with 9,745 bits. 9.745 kbit requires an extra mental step. Not a huge one but an extra one.

It all boils down to the private keys: if you make them public, then expect to see your btc leave.

Not to open a can of worms but there have been many, many discussions here on inflation vs deflation (just search) but just bear in mind there are 2 types of inflation/defaltion that get cross-discussed:
1) monetary SUPPLY (the amount of notes in circulation)
2) PRICES on good and services.
Many of us, Satoshi included, believe the supply of notes will affect the price. There have been many altcoins that thought they knew better and wanted basically an unlimited supply of coins and their price went into the toilet.

Realize first that value is subjective. Value is most often tied to utility.

People all over the world are finding that useful and thus ascribe value to it.

Well the question presupposes "the limit" is a problem. There are a few reasons why this is not a current problem but the one that stands out to me, is that the bitcoin network is not like some cc processing gateway with a hard processing limit. Transactions (tx) in bitcoin basically get bundled into groups of tx or blocks. So if the volume of tx increases so dramatically so as to "not fit", those tx can roll into the next block. While the current block size is defined, it can also be redefined in the future to support an increase of volume. So basically "the limit" is an artificial problem for the foreseeable future.

Yes but if they ever wanna buy something with bitcoin (as of right now) they will (99.9% of the time) scan a qr code to pay a merchant.

You've been successfully marketed to by cc companies into thinking they so kindly eat fraudulent charges - **they don't**, they stick the "reverse" charges to whatever merchant received the payment. In these cases, there was no merchant to stick the loss to because it went to another bank (and then another, then another etc). If people understood how easy it is to take funds from a bank account via ACH, people would never write checks.

As the dollar "weakens" (ie goes down in value compared to other currencies, most notable the euro/pound/yen) the price of bitcoin goes up. As the dollar "strengthens" the price of bitcoin goes down. 
So....if QE4/anything-like-it rolls out, then the dollar is weakened through printing more dollar-notes and the price of bitcoin will go up. Now of course other factors, (mainly market adoption) come into play, like a google/apple/facebook adopting bitcoin in some way, then you can also plan to see moon-math prices for btc.
Yea, supply and demand.

IF the customer was the actual card owner, then yes you can usually win a dispute case - and the CARDHOLDER has to pay - NOT the bank.

It's more about it being a POSSIBLE problem...in 2140. Which would you rather hold as savings - something that is likely to be worth less down the road (inflation) or something that is likely to be worth more down the road (deflation)?
IF bitcoin is dominant in 2140 and IF the deflationary aspects are too problematic for our kids at that time, they will likely try to turn up faucet on the supply of bitcoin and watch the price swirl the drain in an inflationary feedback loop. Works every time.

Are you referring to the inflation of the dollar or bitcoin inflation? If you're referring to the dollar supply, then yes most likely, as dollars move into bitcoin for safety. :) (When the price of bitcoin surges, some even joke that the dollar is falling against bitcoin, as journalists are apt to say with other currencies). If you're referring to bitcoin supply inflation, then yes there are 25 new coins added to the total supply every ~10 minutes. Some are destroyed or lost but overall the supply is slowly increasing. The experiment is really about which will be "worth more" in 4 years and unless the internet goes away or there is some unforeseen catastrophic bug in the Bitcoin protocol (less likely every day) then it's a safe bet that the dollar will worth-less and bitcoin will be worth more.

Presupposes mining will stop. It won't. Unless, of course, the economic incentive to do so goes away. The last bitcoins to be mined should be around 2140 - and you and I will probably not be around then. After that time, the miners will get transaction fees from each block mined (which will likely be a shipload of transactions).

Essentially trading would become a [rollercoaster.]( O wait, it already is. ;)
But seriously, essentially what your concern is...well let's call it "The Irrational Actor Fear". A deep-pocketed manipulator. Could be a wealthy trader out for a drunken weekend or a pissed off government/official wanting to wreak havoc and choas. My assumption would be that they THINK they can out play the market but - because of the worldwide distribution of bitcoin, liquidity would come out of the woodwork. They would sadly mistaken. And poorer for the experiment. As a somewhat active trader, I have seen multiple versions of this attempted, usually as massive sells to drive the price lower. Only to see the market absorb it like a sponge.

While I agree with you, "policy" or even "best practices" is not really a "fix" but a band-aid/work-around. Gox failed to work around a known issue and are thus forcing (hmm?) the issue to be "fixed".

"believe" is the key word to keep in mind. But:
1) Bitcoin IS currently inflationary. This growth of supply (25 more every ~10m) is why some would argue the price has fallen the past year. This growth of supply won't stop until ~2140. (Yes the amount of growing supply will halve about every 4 years, and thus slow down, BUT it will still keep adding to the total supply).
2) Bitcoin was not designed to replace credit cards. It was designed for peer to peer payments. Could a "peer" be a coffee shop or an online gift shop or a stock market? Sure. Will it ever "beat" a company moving digits on their own internal ledger? Probably not.

I understand the concern but what do you do if you pay a business cash? You go ask for a refund.
What if they won't give you a refund? You tell their bank to remove the money from their account and deposit it into your account. O wait...you can't do that with cash either.
What if your cash gets stolen and the robber uses it to buy gas? You tell their bank to remove the money from their account and deposit it into your account. O wait...you can't do that with cash either.
The point is btc is like cash - irreversible - aka "payment finality". Credit card companies make merchants responsible for the failure of consumers to properly handle their financial instruments. Yes its nice for us as consumers but its at the cost of merchants being robbed. So 2 thefts happen: you get your cc funds stolen, so you turn around and steal funds from some unsuspecting merchant. 
Of course, if the cc companies paid the losses incurred from their own pocket, that would be different.

Merchants are sick of getting screwed by credit card fees and chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:35:15
Glad to hear you're not closed minded to learning. Well a simplified way to explain bitcoin to the uninitiated, which I assume would include most executives, is that it is like -a worldwide quickbooks in the cloud-. While it is not a traditional accounting software package, it is essentially a transaction ledger. The fastest benefit to a company's bottom line would be reducing their credit card processing fees and associated chargebacks from fraud. Realize its the merchant that eats the cost of stolen credit cards and not V/MC/Amex. For some companies that reduction of fees and expenses could be the difference between a yearly loss and a yearly profit.

Great job but put the brakes on "the puzzle" as this gives people the wrong impression that it is a waste of time producing bitcoin rewards. Mining is about processing transactions and generating a hash of those transactions. It seems every other journalist is addicted to making snarky comments about solving a silly puzzle. Otherwise great job!

ASICminer mines on btcguild so their massive hashing adds serious weight to their luck. (And yes, AM solo mines as well). Solving a block is like a numerical lottery so the more tickets (or in this case, hashes) you have, the better your odds at getting the winning number. In theory, a guy with a old pc cpu solo mining could do the same, but his odds of doing this are REALLY low. More hashes, better odds.

I'm with you but bitcoin is currently mildly inflationary (about every 10 minutes). By comparison to usd its virtually deflationary, kinda like when you're in your car and you suddenly slow down and a car to your side keeps going, it can almost seem like you're going backwards.
True deflationary effects may not be seen till 2140.

Or how much btc that was seized was hot storage and how much was put into cold storage. Ballparking: Roughly 600k btc in gross commissions - 200k expenses - 170k blown on vice (and hits apparently) - 30k seized...leaves about 200k btc sitting some where on a flash drive(s).

My reading of the official declaration is that Chinese bitcoin exchanges can continue operating as basically commodity brokers but that Chinese companies should not accept btc as payment for goods and services. So this seems to line up with that direction.

Thanks again Erik! Bitcoin has brought an interesting conversation (and thus experiment) all across the world: what is "value"?
I'm seeing a formula of sorts to value (aka price):
    utility * scarcity +/- speculation = value
Is it fair to say that goldbugs only/mainly consider the utility ("intrinsic value!") of gold?
*Feel free to adjust/improve*
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:00:29
That's a great point! The phrase "intrinsic value" has been seared into our thinking to the point of creating a blind spot.
in·trin·sic - adjective: intrinsic
1. belonging naturally; essential.
So Federal Reserve tokens (tax tokens?) and shiny yellow metal has natural value? Indeed such a thing does not exist.

When some big merchant (online or offline) starts accepting it or some other merchants' btc volume starts sparking news stories and such, competition kicks in and the snowball effect of 'me too!' kicks in. If Walmart goes for it, Target will follow.
Translation: When they can see (or think they see) the money is there, they will crawl over broken glass for it.
The question is: which merchants get hit the hardest with chargeback losses? They are a prime candidate for btc.

I suspect the FBI thought they seized all his btc when they nabbed the 27k btc (based on their announcement). Then they saw the accounting ledger showed 600k in commissions and started doing the math, not from looking at a wallet.dat file. 
The guy clearly didn't spend much money on his own living but he did have to spend "some" ie. servers, hits(?), rent, coffee; so I still think this pirate booty is in the 200k btc range...waiting to be found.

I had an abridged version of that when I was out walking our dogs and talked to a neighbor who had 'bit' in his license plate, so I asked if it had anything to do with it bitcoin. He said no, more to do with his name and we began talking about bitcoin. He then says he's an exec of new technology at ChasePaymentech (which is one of the largest cc payment processors, IKR!) and I ask if they've considered bitcoin. And he says....
Yea but (basically) we wont consider using anything with a market cap under a billion dollars. So I say bitcoin is approaching 2 billion (it was a couple of couple weeks ago) and he's stunned. They're looking at 'chip and pin' being the next big thing.

Youre going to need to setup a wallet/app on your phone, like blockchain.info, to see the transaction happen live. If you want to roll the dice you could write your multibit address on paper and have him type it in (expect frowns). Or you could unplug your desktop and take it with to the cafe. :)

Sorry for your (potential) loss. In situations like this, send in a support ticket(s) asap, try not to get angry and ask kindly for help, be as patient as possible, and don't freak out. Not saying you did anything wrong, but it does make you want to write in all caps with exclaimations and threats. Gox is worldwide so they have more than a few customers with probably a boatload of support tickets. When you hear back from them, let us know how it turns out. And yes, 2FA everything you can.

As a merchant who has learned this the hard way, sadly, it is exactly how it works. Though I should say that Target will not be the only merchant that is hit; any merchant that rings up a sale using the compromised  will also be hit with the chargebacks.
