I think that it's good that BTC is akin to gold while LTC is akin to Silver...They help each other.

The Bitcoin community needs leadership now more than ever to fight against these regulations. We need to get organized so we can complain to the right people. We need to make noise and make sure our voices are heard! We don't want these bit licenses!!
