Another reply, but I wanted to comment on this.


We are talking about both.
You are right, there is a massive amount of hashing power out there. But It's laughable compared to what you'd need to bruteforce a private key.
C'mon, lets grab vanitygen and give it a spin (on my i5):
* 4 characters: 3 seconds
* 5 charactes: 50% chance in about 4,5minutes
* 6 characters: 50% in 4,5 hours
* 7: 10,5 days
* 8: 1,7 years
* 9: 96,4 years
* 10: about 5600 years
* 11: 325000 years
* 12: some numbers with an 'e' in it
* ...
* 27 (maximum for vanitygen): 50% in 9.321514e+31 years
For a complete address you will need 7 characters more.
okay. now we have more computing power than my i5 on the world. but looking at that number above: do you really think that matters?
I need to sleep, otherwise I'd do those calculations as well. but keep in mind: that is a number with a LOT of zeros up there. and you need 58^7 times more than that.
If you can generate a specific address of the network, there are a lot better targets. and the network would be broken anyway.

you put a PIN on it and optionally encrypt it.
If it gets stolen, you can recover from your paper backup. either via compatible client or new trezor. A thief can't use it without at least the PIN (which has hardcoded exponential wait-time for every wrong guess)
If you don't encrypt it, someone with your paper backup can also recover it, so ideally you should encrypt it, in which case you need the password to decrypt the paper backup

every address theoretically already exists. There is no central database of what address is used or not. If you generate an address, you pick a random private key and extract the public key from that.
And yes, if anyone ever generates a private key for that address, the money would be there, waiting. The chances of that happening are pretty much non-existent. The universe will die several times over before the chances get anywhere plausible.
@_date: 2015-09-07 13:33:28
I wouldn't event trust Kim my public keys
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:21:22
there are 2^160 possible keys.
let's use [vanitygen]( to bruteforce some keys and go over the numbers. Basicly, this tool generates a random key, checks if the public key matches to a wanted one, and generates the next one if not.
They list 50-60 million keys/second as speed in one of the benchmarks. Let's use 100 Million for sake of argument.
[100Mkey/s will take 3.4*10^22 times the age of the universe if the last tested key is the correct one](
Now, statistics helps us a little bit, and on average we probably guess the correct key in [half the time.](
Well, that's a bit long. lets throw some money on this thing (hell, there is a lot of money on some addresses!). let's buy a million of these setups.
[1.7*10^16 universe ages](
... well, fuck.
okay. let's get out the big guns. We're using some kind of supercomputer which can calculate 1 Trillion keys a second, and use a trillion of these things! *[doctor evil stare intensifies]*
Aaaand... [fuck](
Let's just say: it's not something you do in your free time.
Oh yeah. This all for just a single address. not a wallet. Also not considering the cost of power, cooling etc.
Another thing that might be worth considering ([see the quote](

because it's unlikely that 2-3 nodes can solve more work than the complete other part of the world, their computations get discarded as invalid. The bigger chain with more validations win. That's the reason bitcoin can't be scammed by a single person or small group.

ugh, encrypted subs are pretty hard to digest
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:35:15
not sure. I don't think they ever check the apps or contents. normally they get wiped immediatly and sold

@_date: 2013-02-16 14:04:46
That's nice. But you propably don't want to check how muh in power you paid for that ;)
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:51:53
because it is self-signed.
All of the ccc certs are selfsigned. Because the CA system is more or less broken anyway, why not just self-sign it anyway?
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:44:21
So I only use fiat to get stuff from amazon?
I like that analogy
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:00:08

@_date: 2013-07-08 18:48:38

@_date: 2013-04-08 09:30:38

@_date: 2013-11-02 22:19:58
the eyetwitch is perfect
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:02:10
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:35:12
looks like they changed it. they used only selfsigned stuff for quite a whle
@_date: 2013-01-21 23:52:38
it was free aswell. you paid for premium download speeds
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:46:37
crash, my baby. craaaassh. let me buy-in cheaper
@_date: 2013-02-02 16:44:16
well, you could be one of the lucky ones getting paid your orders by some random dude ;)
@_date: 2013-06-28 09:11:25

The site shown is
that domain is registered *by proxy* on godaddy.
How it ends up on ebay blog? no idea. But that looks anything but legit
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:44:21
In programming, a . is used as a decimal. they just didn't convert it. Almost no website does it
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:44:20
as someone who has lost quite a few thousand of $ in BTC a few month ago (lost smartphone...), I bow to you. good job
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:59:29
now we'd only need some beer company to accept bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:33:11
Seen their presentation at OHM 2013
It's nice, but still has some trust-problems
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:16:26
I, for one, welcome our linkfixing overlord
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:35:40
Well, technically, it IS a matter of time. Just a very very long time
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:02:02

@_date: 2013-11-09 13:47:47
thanks. too hungry to grammar
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:25:30
Anyone else got to know them because of breaking bad?
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:04:52
I think I have never seen so much money on one spot

I'm still waiting for the "Only sync blockchain when on Wifi" feature for ages...
This really keeps me from running the app 24/7 and everytime I use it, it needs to download a few weeks of data...
not fun
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:03:27
we need more struts
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:45:57
check the domain in the title ;)
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:43:04
too lazy to charge my bitcoin bot account. any address I can donate to?
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:55:38
and some time on your hands.
now that I think about it, that would actually be quite a fun project
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:45:53

@_date: 2013-02-16 17:23:47
