Segwit transactions are calculated/prioritized different than regular transactions by miners. I've sent both types of transactions at the same time, using the same sat/byte price, aiming for a next couple hours confirmation time according to johoe's mempool stats. The regular one had about the predicted wait time, and the segwit one got confirmed in the next block

Interesting analysis; but it seems to me that what you are demonstrating is the profitability of being a bitmain reseller.  Keeping a large stock doing work certainly adds to the profit, but is not the main money maker of the business.
The whole plan of a completely off grid solar Hydroponic farm / crypto mine is really attractive; but I just cant understand how you fit everything needed with that budget.
If the setup cost for each miner was $8500, and that includes 30 solar panels each. assuming 280W panels, you have 8.4 Kw of solar generation per miner. If you get an installed cost of about US $1/W for a complete system (possible at the scale you are talking), there's not much more left for the rest of the setup. 
But the real expensive part of an off grid system is the battery storage. I don't know much about forklift batteries; but if you were using tesla powerwalls, you'll need about two of them to support  24/7 operation of one miner. That's about an extra cost of $14000 per miner! 
Could you elaborate a bit more on how you solved that part of the system?

WTF? your prices are more than 25% higher than the local bitcoins offers in chile.
Seems more like a site trying to take advantage of noobs.

With bitpay, or most payment procesors; you pay market order price on the BTC, plus a badly calculated high priority miner fee.  
When I sell on an exchange, I usually pay like 1sat/byte to transfer BTC at a low demand time. Then place a limit order that more than offset the exchange fee cost, and fiat withdrawals are free.
This may be  heresy  to say in this sub, but in case of multiple buys, using credit card I only need to pay fees once per month for all the purchases. The savings can be big when the fee market go nuts.

It was really funny reading that self proclaimed cryptographic expert, with a known proven perfect opsec, had no idea that you can do encypted backups of your most valuable data. 
You dont need to be a hardware expert to know that you can never trust all you data security to a single hard drive. And not even an enterprise class drive, just a crappy cheap notebook one. 
He created the most redundant hiper secure distributed database, and believed that the best way of securing private keys is not having aditional copies... What a clown!

Well yes, being into bitcoin has been a great motivation to live a frugal life. To manage your money in term of savings, instead of spendings. 
I guess the main difference is if you have reached your own personal moon or not.

Bitcoin in the base layer is not that great as a payments platform. Waiting for confirmation has always been a PITA.
Merchants should implement lightning nodes.
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:58:41
Is not that is a big regret, as I said it's not bad enyoing your profits from time to time. 
The point is that in the future is going to be easier to think "I spent us$300 on that" than "I spent 0.5 BTC on it"

It does not need to happen all at the same time. Traditional online shopping is done instantly with credit card. Then you have up to the next month to produce the money. Exchange rate tend to favor the patient. Of course there\`s some risk when the market flops, but the delay also rewards you on bull market. You should\`nt be spending your sats in a bear market anyways...
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:04:09
haha, no thanks, I don\`t do shitcoins :P
Tried mining long time ago (when GPUs were good at BTC) but did\`nt liked living close to my pc with the fans screaming at full blast all the time. Plus did some calculations on the electric bill, and made more sence to just spend the money buying BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:12:30


That depends on the state of the fee market. When i sell, i can control the miner fee spent. When you pay BTC on newegg, you are forced to pay whatever crazy amount Bitpay decide. And your payment is instantly converted to a sell order on their side, so end up in the same number of steps.

Given the high volatility within the cycle, it seems more realistic to calculate the multiplier on the bottom of each period. So from $200 to $3200 we had a 16X increase. My theory is that with each halving we will also see a halving in growth, so bottom of bear market in 2023 may be 8x $3200 = $24000, and bubble top 8x $20000 = $160000
Edit: Replaced halving in volatility for halving in growth
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:55:54
Thats a good way to look at it.
Glass half full = That GPU cost me just 50 dollars
Glass half empty = That GPU may have costed me 6000 dollars

The sad part is that I bought it because my existing graphics card died just outside its one year warranty. 
But I dont regret buying it, I was going to do it anyways, and it have been very usefull. I just wish it did\`nt remind me of the Btc spent on it. 
Is not that big of a deal, I just wanted to share this story, because probably I\`ve made other worst trades involving bitcoin, but this is the only one I see everyday.
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:29:12
I switched words and said halving in volatility instead of halving in growth, but you got the idea. Our numbers match within a reasonable margin of error for BTC. Volatility should also be decreasing, but seems more difficult to find a rule for that.
I don\`t see that difficult a price of several millions in the long term. Just not in todays value, but in a world of collapsed and highly devalued fiat money.

Chinese exchanges used to operate with no transaction fees, so transaction volume was greatly over inflated.
That ended abruptly with the central government banning the no fee business model.

Charge them a fee. People willingness to learn something improves a lot when that means they can save money.

Electrum updates fail in linux when your system uses an older version of python.
You need to get  python 3.6.1 or higher working first, then update electrum.

The idea is that once you have money in a channel, you can make payments that are aproved instantly, without stress about confirmation times or the current state of the fee market.
Is still not there yet as a fully functional user experience for everyone, but it works for small payments, perfect to learn to use it.

Stop spreading miths. Checksums don't work that way. 
Have you ever seen a vanity address on the last characters?
It\`s impossible to put anything different at the end than the checksum of the previous character string, and produce a valid BTC address.

yeah, I did that in one case. Normaly the second transaction woud'nt had a chance to propagate as it is a real double spend, but it got confirmed, and the first one got dropped by any node that remembered it.
Edit: big mempool nodes would reject the first tansaction as soon as the replacement apeared in a block, and never rebroadcasted it. it did not needed to wait months to be fully rejected.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:58:33
During 2017 bull run, i had some cheap fee transactions that had to wait about two months to be confirmed. Most nodes dropped them as their mempool filled, but later resurfaced without me having to rebroadcast. In practice transactions never expire, there's always some good memory node somewhere, doing the job of reminding all the others.

Blockchain.info calculate the fee value without the segwit discount. It uses actual tx size instead of Vsize, thus reporting an incorrect Sat/B value. Using a better block explorer you can see that your Tx has an actual fee of 1.08 sat/B

That was not just the consequence of a difficulty adjustment; but the effect of a synchronized hashrate attack with the BCH EDA exploit; which is no longer a factor.

You first need to agree on the definition of a ponzi scheme: For me, the whole economic system is a big piramid, and a Ponzi is just the name asigned to a smaller one not controled by a sovereign centran bank.

Thanks for a great analisys and very well presented
Seems like your proyection values match with the logarithmic regression curves of [moonmath.win]( but with a much better visual representation of the data.
The only thig that I don't agree is with using a simple offset of the linear regression line to define the lower support limit. It don´t look right that only the top band tapers in time. Acording to that, after about 2030, the lower band starts to be the more volatile one. Both bands should be tapering in the same proportion. It seems to me that a support line traced with that rule, will be a better match with the price action of the last year, and be able to better include the curve at the beginning.
@_date: 2019-09-05 05:23:00
Given the "peaky" nature of price cycles, deviation from the mean must be bigger at the top. Having symeric bands would need an equal probability of a long sustained period riding the top line, as is common with the bottom one. I don´t think we are going to see that.

Tech sites I used to read had frecuent news about bitcoin from the begining. Remember reading an article about the whitepaper, and thought "man, that´s a beautiful internet utopia, shame that it is never going to work"
Somewhere in the first years I even installed the software and tried it for some hours, but decided it was not worth the hassle to have my pc screaming at full load, for funny money of the internet. Decided it was better to just buy it, but that too seemed too complicated at the time.
Kept reading the news from time to time, but at the end it took me about 4 years to decide to really start investing in it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:54:53
Somewhat similar story here. I knew about bitcoin almost fron the begining, but never cared too much about it up until 2012-2013.
At first It was a small amount that i treated as fun money, trying to game the market on exchanges. Rode the 2013 bubbles, and end up finding that now it was a serious ammount, but i had lost half of my initial coins doing the wrong bets. I learnt my lesson and turned into a hodler.  Decided to be smart this time, dont FOMO anymore, and wait for the bear market to settle to make new investments. At mid 2014, when bitcoin was floating arroun the $600 band, thought it was the bottom and went all in.
Then disaster strike. The bear market deepened, and I had an accident that left me with serious leg injuries. It took about a full year to recover my normal life. Being an independent professional, I found myself unable to work, deep into medical expenses, and with most of my savings loked into what was at the time a very bad investment. But I hodled. I saved wherever i could, learnt to live with minimal expenses, and managed to survive the long bear market  without touching my cold storage coins.
In 2017, when my big bet was finally paying, I foud that I didn\`t needed to cash out. I became used to livin with low expenses, and liked my new lifestyle with less things to care about, and less pressure to generate income. Now I can have more free time, work whenever I want because I like my job, and not because I need it to sustain a more expensive lifestyle. I enjoy having an old car that I can fix whenever it fails, but nobody cares to try to steal it. 
Of course at some point it don\`t make sense to be sitting in a big pile of money without enjoing some of the benefits, and a pure hodling strategy is not wise enough. I now have some rules: I had defined a small % available to start DCA selling during bull market. Stop when the price is dropping, and start DCA buying only when it drops below the average sell value of the previous cycle. Resume selling only when the price surpasses the last buy cycle average.
