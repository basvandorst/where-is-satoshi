I'm sure going from 99% to 100% circlejerk is exactly what will make this place go mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 22:06:16
The mods thought so!

I'm really banned, message a mod or something.

Bitcoin was a short term fad, once it peaked and started losing money there was really no reason to stay in, if you are losing money every day it's better to just quit. So everyone not treating it like a cult quit and it's just spiraling lower and lower from that.

Plan to post that anywhere? Or it a rule you just made up?

Don't ever expect to ever see any change that will damage the investment in mining equipment the pools have made to ever show up in the core bitcoin protocol regardless of how much it'd benefit the community.

"my libertarian money system runs based on charity" sounds like a flawed plan.

What? You guys have deleted tons of my comments over time.

The currency of the future features the futuristic feature of there being literally no way to know if a set fee is or isn't enough to get a miner to include it. Also the suggested minimum enforced by the network it takes to spend money changes if you were paid in a lump sum or in hundreds of tiny transactions EVEN if the end result is the same.

This is going to make you furious, but I don't have negative karma, in general OR on this subreddit.

At least two of the top developers are also top miners, which is great because it means there is even more centralization and conflict of interest.

It is too late, bitcoin peaked at 1100 and has been declining for months and months. Even if it returns to 1100 or 2000 or whatever and gets a 100 or 400% return it will never have the same level of growth it had from pennies to 1000 dollars. Fantasies that it'll go to billions or trillions a coin are nonsense for delusional people. Even if it rises again it's never going to rise that many orders of magnitude ever again ever.

"In 2013, Rubin worked with three other undergraduates on a bitcoin-related project called Tidbit. Tidbit was later subpoenaed by the New Jersey attorney general as part of a consumer fraud investigation."
Haha Bitcoin.

Think the mods will post some guidelines on what opinions are allowed and which aren't or will it just be a secret thing where if people aren't posting enough positive about bitcoin they might no longer be able to post? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 14:45:49
Also remember that GHash estimates only account for miners that actually get blocks occasionally, all the miners not getting blocks in a day don't show up in the estimate at all. So the actual amount of wasted money could be orders of magnitude higher and we'd have no way to know. 
1 million dollars an hour is the absolute lowest bound for how much bitcoin costs to run, since you are using a low price for power, assuming the highest quality miner and only counting the miners that show up on the network (the ones that got blocks in a day) the real cost could be dozens of times higher.

Any chance you will post the rules somewhere of what is bannable in or is it a secret?

Good news, Luke-Jr is one of the top ten biggest contributors to bitcoin core and theymos is a high level mod on bitcoin talk and this forum. Bitcoin is corrupt right to the bone. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:13:47
I really do think the rules are "the rules get stricter the more the price is collapsing". Remember that time the price was crashing and suddenly they had a "no posts discussing the price of bitcoin" and then that rule vanished the second the price started back up? The price is cratering now and just all of a sudden there is a heap of new rules designed to squash disagreement. First the shadow banning, now just regular banning. (I have hundreds of thousands of karma, and this might surprise some readers but have +800 something karma for this forum)

No one is trying to raise gox, a bunch of children just think they are being super clever and will trick japan if they make a plan where they pretend they will restart gox but really just go "haw haw, got the coins back, debts canceled somehow by magic!"
