There is a little bit of a ... vibration coming from his room when I walk under it in the basement, but it also could be a regular fan or something. Keeps his door closed 100% of the time now. Thanks for the response.

That is definitely the way it's going to go! But I just didn't want him to pull some bitcoin mining shenanigans on me. But either way, no matter what's causing the big bill, I can't pay for it. I told him he would have a flat rent rate and I'd pay the bills, but it's fair to assume it comes with a "within reason" expectation, I think.

Okay dude calm down no one is trying to play games. I opened my home to a young professional who needed a room. He's a nice kid. I have a nice home. We all like each other. Chill.

That is a perfectly fair opinion, but in the meantime I can't afford to pay these electric bills with a mortgage and a new HVAC to pay off.

If you were him, you didn't sign a lease and I would be throwing you out on your ass in the snow as fast as I possibly could. But he's a lot nicer than you, at least from what I can tell by your comment, so I would give him the benefit of the doubt.

Oh interesting! This is the kind of thing I was hoping to learn. I feel like I'm a few years behind on this stuff so I appreciate your reply.

Great idea.
