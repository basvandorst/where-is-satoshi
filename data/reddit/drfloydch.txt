Good and sad analysis at the same time.

At least, It mitigates the risk to choose a "very" bad entry point.

You don t need to buy a full btc at once. The price is just insane. Invest weekly not too big amount maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:03:01
It can...depends on the current market. If you are sure the market will go up it s not the way to go. But who can be sure ? If you invest your total amount 4 times in one month maybe you can enter in a tempory dip..

You are in now, you will have the common illness to check the rate each 10min ;-)

Don t blame yourself. Everybody makes mistakes. You bought at 24$. You are 99.9999% smarter than the people here, me included. You took a bad descision that costed a lot but relax you don t loose your bet (first invest)

Maybe, if you have substantial amount, you can look at some countries where you can create a company without big fees and use the money to buy some IT things etc. Maybe you can justify that you are your own boss. The limit is just tiny... The problem is that strict rules are only applied for normal people, the big ones with a lot of money easily find a way. But a good solution, maybe, is to ask a fiscal hotline ;-) to remain perfectly clean with your country regulations.

It s not.... No replay for 2x but let this guy loose all his coins... Don t be a fool play safe, do nothing after the fork...
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:37:38
yes and some traders try to do some "arbitrage"...
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:40:17
i will not ask you for an entry point ;). Keep your coins long term "normally" it will go ok. Next time play "dollar cost averaging". on week, month, quarter...
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:54:16
Good job
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:39:22
That's why you use Monero to store your funds etc and use xmr.to when you want to transac with your not well educated friends ;)
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:54:46
You are right for XMR at least ;-) 
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:26:18
Hard to live in USA....are the banks or JPM exempted? The law seems not fair at all if it s the case...?
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:17:50
Trezor or Ledger
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:49:39
xmr is not an alt coin ;-)

You can trust swiss school too... Simple design fully open source etc digitalbitbox.com

Thx for the info. I do it even for normal ones.(100 limit). But good to know

We are true direct democraty, people can vote the laws not only their deputies that sell their soul to lobbies. ;-)

This Segwit2x thing is a little obscur for me. I m more confident to put trust in dev team than in servers/miners big companies/cartel. But maybe my view is biased and the problem is more complex. Who knows. That's sad because i would prefer consensual decisions for the future of bitcoin.
