The videos show people in receipt of gold bars from Anthem Vault and Anthem Gold using magnets to pick the bars right off the table.   The response by Anthem H. Blanchard and his mother Cynthia Blanchard is to submit spectrometer reports on the gold bars.   Yet everyone responding just respond with photos or videos of the gold bars stuck to magnets, with captions like spectrometer?   More testing other than a magnet ?

Don’t trade for AGLD the Anthem Gold by Anthem Hayek Blanchard, because the only gold they ship is magnetic gold!

The scam of the year award should go to Anthem H Blanchard and Logan Ryan Golema for their $98 million Hercules coin scam and AnthemGold AGLD token since they are shipping magnetic gold!!

Hopefully they will look closely at Anthem and Cynthia Blanchard, and the $32 million in crypto they stole from the rest of us.  That crypto is now worth over $68million!
They have accounts in Puerto Rico, Grand Cayman, Luxembourg, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, Panama, etc 
Now reports are surfacing they have been shipping magnetic gold and the HERC platform is being used to host encrypted child porn!
Jail these crooks!
