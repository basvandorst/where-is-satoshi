Merchants can accept it all they want but who would sell their btc that's appreciating over their dollars which are depreciating?
The idea btc needs merchant adoption to succeed is a myth, and those who use it to gauge bitcoins success are noobs

How bout robinhood
Have used coinbase pro for years, but the times I've looked robinhood has been cheaper.
Right now RH is $3 higher per btc than CB pro, but 0 fees

The most efficient cash system the world has ever known is built on top of bitcoin
Lightning network can send value instantly, free, and millions of transactions per second
To say btc doesnt serve as a cash payment system is quite inaccurate

I think All halvings are priced in bc the market price is the sum of all information
You bought btc bc it has a finite supply, right? Bc the new supply halves every 4 years till you die? Me too, so I'd say next halving and halvings there after are priced in.
My argument would be the sum of information is extraordinarily low.
How does a deflationary currency respond in a world of inflationary fiat? How many people even know what bitcoin is or the function it serves? How many people know the banking system is about to collapse? How much money are the banks going to print before they do? Hows btc going to respond when its inflation rate is lower than usd? How does btc scale to meet the worlds needs?
As each of those questions are answered, and more information becomes available... or the certainty of the answers increases, I think u see the price rise

Yea I agree, that's why I like sum of information, bc not many people know or understand, making the sum very low
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:24:50
Well I've priced it in. I buy as much as I can as soon as I can.... I surely cant be alone

Btc is a superior form of money in every way
What you're witnessing isnt a bubble, it's evolution
