Not exactly. When you have a large amount of money to declare, the burden of proof is on YOU to prove that you acquired that money legally - so you need to either prove that you mined it or bought it, otherwise the IRS can just freeze your assets... that is if you are in IRS jurisdiction.

Me too. I love the idea, but it just doesn't seem to be that active a project. Also, since it runs on top of bitcoin, it has become way to expensive. I'd love to see a project like counterparty succeed even if it means it has to be built on top of something like Ethereum
