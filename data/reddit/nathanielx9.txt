It doesn’t matter about the price of bitcoin or the iPhone. It depends what you would pay for it and society will pay. As of now it’s normal to pay for a $1000 through a contract with the cellular provider and it’s normal to pay for bitcoin at X given price.

Do you even know how atm work? The btc atm charges 2% for buying btc. Atm have to process the payments for nonbank users. If you have a BOA and use a chase atm you gonna get charged for fees to process between one financial institution to another.
This argument is stupid. Transfer money isn’t free.

1. Fees are based on the network and are subject to change 
2. If you scan a qr code or type it in wrong it’s the users fault
3. Yes one problem, yet can be solved if a prevention can be put in place, yet it’s been over 10 years and no one has ever been able too, so remind me in another 10 years
4. It’s your money and btc is secured. Best solution only put what you need on the network . Besides that hardware wallet or paper wallet. Besides that it’s users error.
I’m not all in btc cause I’m not a btc maximalist. My portfolio is diversify where I see value. There’s value in btc along with other crypto’s if you take time and learn and meet the teams one on one.

You assuming I got in at the top of 2017, which your wrong. Value isn’t what the cost of it is now, it’s the technology that will destroy the corruption in the financial sector. Making it transparent. When/if crypto replace fiat,it won’t matter and would be valued as SATS.

My problem with this movement is you really think an exchanges has all the btc in a hotwallet?
Three things are gonna happen
- everyone withdraws and network gets clogged
- a hacker is about to hack every exchange’s hotwallet cause of some idea you shouldn’t trust exchanges. So while the exchanges need to withdraw the funds to their hotwallet; they will get hacked
- nothing... nothing will happen and everyone will laugh

How many news articles saying bitcoin is dead when it dropped 80% for ath.

I find it weird on coin marketcap still says it’s 1.7bil mc on teather after that report. I guess they have 500mil they can pump this market unless it’s insurance for their investors. 
But with btc I’ve heard, not sure if it’s true, but if it drops under 6k it’s not profitable. Now I would image the difficulty would adjust, but not sure

It wouldn’t and tbh it doesn’t matter. Btc network is stronger and safer atm. He still hasn’t proven it in court yet and probably will never be able too.

Did they leave out the dot? Maybe I’m over thinking it. 100,00=16,25.....100.00=16.25

I just don’t understand why bash on ltc? What has it ever done so bad besides push for updates to help btc?
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:10:28
The joke idea came from the stable coin btc at 6k and all those high end predictions, while I’m here like I think at least 7k by eoy
