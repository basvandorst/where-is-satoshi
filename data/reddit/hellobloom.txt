Could you do the same thing with a Monzo card?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:32:52
This guy also explains it. Says you need a Fire.com account too.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:39:26
Seeing as you have BTC already should make it easier without ID.
I dont think Bittrex or Bitfinex need it
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:20:08
oh bum! I moved to early. Thought it would start increasing as soon as the CME opened, like what happened with CBOE the week before.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:30:49
how the f**k do you have 5k a day at age 17!

Will Bitcoin drop again when GDAX go live with Bitcoin Cash for the second time, at 9am ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:36:41
Good question. Exactly what time is it opening?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:28:21
Am I right in thinking that by investing in ALT coins you are also investing in Bitcoin?
Because you have to take the ALT coins out through ALT/BTC, then BTC/USD, 
So any final USD profit, would be change in ALT x (multiplied by) change in BTC?
(This does not include ATL coins that have pairing to ETH or LTC)
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:30:07
It is cause you have an order in place already? That locks up whats needed for the order.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:51
Any ideas whats caused the rise today?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:27:37
Looks like this pre-CME dip isn't coming then.
Guess everyone saw that it had no effect last week with CBOE so it's back to normal.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:41:04
I know the two are different.
But the value of an ALT coin in USD is intrinsically linked to BTC, as you would need to trade it to that first to take any profit.
If ALT increase by 50%, and BTC looses 50%. Your holding of the ALT, will be worth the same USD.
If ATL decreases by 10%, but BTC increases by 200%. Your holding of the ALT, with be worth 180% more USD.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:42:28
Ah, so the % Percent change shown each day is related to their USD value not thier BTC value.
Even though you buy it in BTC. Thats the bit that caught me out.
Thanks for helping me learn Martin.
I would give you a BTC, but...
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:02
So if I look at the charts on coinmarketcap.com I can see that for Ethereum the BTC price and USD price are independent.
However, an ALT like IOTA, every bump and dip is perfectly shown in both. If BTC goes up in USD, IOTA goes up in USD.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:04
its $17k on GDAX and $15.5k on Bittrex.
All fiat is in GDAX.
Can I buy LTC on GDAX, transfer to Bittrex, Sell LTC for BTC on Bittrex at the lower BTC price?
Would this save me a bit?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:23:24
Is there a website that rates the currently most talked about Cryptos across social media?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:56:49
One last thing. 
So when BTC dropped 20% a few hours ago, why didn't the BTC price of IOTA increase by 20%?
IOTA hasn't change, but BTC is worth less, so surely each IOTA is worth more BTC. 
What actually happened was that both dropped. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:32:52
30 mins
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:00:22
So why didn't that happen a few hours ago on the first attempt?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:29:32
Could you do a similar thing with PayPal?
(avoid me opening another account)
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:46:49
Do you think we'll see another dip towards the end of the week before CME futures? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:21:52
Use BTC for big slow trades and LTC for small fast trades.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:20:36
I think we are getting wires crossed, or you are answering a different question to what I'm asking.
Lets say on Binance I have 10 IOTA.
Each IOTA is worth 0.2 BTC.
Each BTC is worth 10,000 USD.
So my IOTA is worth 1 BTC, or 20,000 USD
if the company IOTA doesnt do much for 2 weeks, their coin value does change. 1 IOTA is still worth 0.2 BTC on Binance.
However, over those 2 weeks BTC has done well. They have increase from 10,000 USD to 20,000 USD
I still have 10 IOTA.
They are still worth 0.2 BTC each
but BTC has increased to 20,000 USD
So my IOTA is now worth 40,000 USD
Either that or I'm totally wrong. lol!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:30:54
ah ok. thanks for explaining.
So if IOTA holds its BTC value. But BTC has a good week and increased, then really IOTA must have had an equally good week to keep pace with it.
So if your moving BTC holdings into ALTs, you're really only looking for ones that are going to outperform BTC?

Is there any news that's sparked the drop back down to $9K ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:33
operation dragonslayer has kicked in!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:01
I'm in the UK if that changes anything.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:53
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:44
I managed buy at $9130
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:59
surely we would have seen that thoughtout the day or at $11k though?
