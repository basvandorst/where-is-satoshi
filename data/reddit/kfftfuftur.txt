O.k. obviously I would still include a payout address for the reward, but my idea was that you could create verry small blocks so it would be easier to hash them. While giving me the full block reward.
But I already found out that won't work because the way bitcoin blocks are mined.

An digital clock would likely just display a random mess and wouldnt be roght at all. 
And even if you use the 24h format a normal analog clock would still make two turns in a day so it would be right twice.

If the bitcoin price was lower than the electricity bill, miners couldn't make profit and would stop mining which would be a real possibility.
But because of some miners quit the overall hashrate will go down and the mining difficulty would be adjusted to keep the rate of one block per 10 minutes, so the electricity cost would go down instead of the price going up.

you could try double spending the transaction with a higher fee and hope the second transaction will be the one to get into the blockchain.

isnt it funy how people reply with coments that make no sense?
I dont want to change the blockchain, but instead generate an entirely new one. there would be no bits of.

Why couldn't it happen this way?
Is there a mechanism that stops the difficulty from going to high?

My question wasn't really about quantum computing destroying bitcoin, but rather if you where able to somehow mine really fast, maybe with a quantum computer, or just by using a giant mining pool, and then suddenly stopped mining so that the remaining miners would need much longer than intended to mine 2016 blocks untill the mining difficulty is recalculated

so it wont work because of the first block, but if you could make your own first block, with a date maybe around the year 2000 and then starting from that new blocks allways dated 10 minutes later then the previous blocks you should be able to catch up verry fast, since the difficulty of the proof of work is adjusted so there will be one block every 10 minutes it would not be adjusted since there is already only one block every 10 minutes in the blockchain.
