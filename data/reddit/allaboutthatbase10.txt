@_date: 2017-11-16 10:27:26
Thank you for the insight. A couple things-
Futures were still generally new back then, and computers were nowhere near as involved as now. With modern data and metrics, a crash due to speculation is not as likely.
We had ~26% drop last weekend, which was mostly recovered by Tuesday. Do you think a 1987- style drop would even make a difference here? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:19:25
How does that change the advice? They've never done this and they're asking for help on Reddit. They probably bought their coin on Coinbase, which means the IRS would know it was purchased, if not sold there too. 
Since you seem to know more than I, what kind of fines are they look at if they're caught? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:59:47
Not exactly. This is a totally unregulated industry. When we were without regulation in the oil industry, Standard Oil would take a loss in order to drive out local competition, then raise prices to what they thought the economy would withstand. The fact that a group is willing to stick with their current plan and thumb their noses at an oligarchy makes me more confident about BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:48:33
I'm starting to wonder if all that volume last weekend was just to make a little extra money off fees, before they all but dissappear

BTC does have problems that need addressed. If those are addressed, then I think you're going to see it roll into a more mainstream use. But what you will probably never see is its use as a daily currency, at least not in countries with stable, strong economies. Generally, people don't want to use a system that is growing like this as daily currency- they want to use it as an investment.
That's where I think a coin like ETH has an advantage- an inflationary coin that keeps a very stable value. Now if they could fix their own problems, I might invest in it again.
Personally, why would I HODL a coin whose 12 month growth resembles a decaying sine wave? I would move money into that (or better yet, just get paid in it) and forget about saving it for the future.

I can agree with this, but we aren't talking about a singular person for each of these entities. Are we even talking about a federated arrangement? Are these miners forced to be in a specific pool, or vote with the pool? (I'm honestly still learning a good deal about how the Blockchain works) From what I gather on Slush, that isn't the case.
From the current 24 hour chart, it appears that it would take 4 players to form a majority. At what point do you think that the 'oligarchy' model falls apart? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:50:45

I heard about BTC way back in 2014... I had no idea how to contact someone with coins to buy. I went to college, found my wife and had some kids before finishing my degree, and happened to talk with the new guy at work who was buying crypto. I convinced my wife- just last month- that we should get more than the measly $15 I put in last year into this. Now we're claiming our maximum withholdings so we can put the extra money into BTC.
We may branch out to other coins- I was playing in ETH for a while, but it never really goes up. Either way, we'll hodl until April, and let Uncle Sam have his cut.

I don't think this is the case. The 'value' as traditional economics would put it, is in the security of the coin. If a fork leaves me vulnerable to a known type of attack, why would I keep it?
I love BTC. I was a fan when I first heard about it on Planet Money, when it was $40/coin. I finally convinced my cautious wife that we should be serious about our investment in it. But I'll be holding my coin until I feel certain about its security.

No one just drops $800k on a coin. If they will, it's because they can afford to. And they should be diversified by then.
But if your question is, what will I do if there's a ~75% drop, that's easy: everything the veteran HODLers did the last time. HODL.

Actually, no. You don't need to have 50+ BTCs for this to happen. You can invest as little as 300/ month and have $1B in 3 years. This is, of course, assuming that we continue to see the crazy growth we've had over the past few years.
Try it out: Break out Excel, assume a rough rate of 500%/ year (around 42%/ month).
We're putting in every other paycheck (so, once every 4 weeks). I applied a mod 2 function to account for the investment.

As a scientist IRL, I can tell you that anyone who ever got caught scamming the scientific community is completely ban-hammered out.
Personally, I don't know why Mr. Ver is even allowed to have input in BTC's future. I'm still new to the community, so I assume he has a considerable amount of miners behind him for this to continue. 
From my perspective, he should have considered himself lucky after the first 2 scams. If this meme is to be believed, he has no technical expertise and has twice before misled the community to his own profit. I will remember his name, and I will dump all my coin the next time I see a fork involving him.

Not really. Your argument is that a company can crumble in the face of a more agile competitor... Facebook did it better, and MySpace didn't evolve. BTC had Mt. Gox, ETH and the other AltCoins, BCH. BTC has not only survived, it's gotten bigger.

Absolutely. The value of Bitcoin is in its ability to be stored securely; this is what HODLers want. Beyond that, the value compared to fiat is kind of arbitrary.
