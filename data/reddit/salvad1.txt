you probably dont want to buy btc at a bear market if youre not made of money. but anyways i hope is not all your savings or anithing buy it at [localbitcoin.com]( and download a well rated wallet.

Always use [Localbitcoins.com]( and buy to people with verify ID and good rep. otherwise you will be paying high fees. i hope this is for a long term investment. we are still in bear market.

 $1100 and then $900.   
Thats real capitulation even people buying the "bottom" at 3k will sell their Btc to real Bitcon maximalisist. Mark my words. lol

make sense they start selling btc and buying presents at 20k with very much anticipation just in case. xDD

Nothing will happen is just a minority doing marketing with this. all the whales that are trading dont know if tomorrow morning their exchange will desapair with all their prived keys thats why they trust them and every day they are taking that risk. If youre using your exchagne as a wallet, youre wrong and you must have full control of your prived keys. if youre a trader you will take the coins out and put in back in the 5 of january.

ne , you just wait until the mempool is low on tx, use segwit, and if you have more than 1btc by the time that fees are stable at 30usd dont be a rat and pay the 30usd fee.
