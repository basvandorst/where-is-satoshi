Stupid comment. In the long run, we're all dead.

There is no link in your post.

I have.  
And Hayek.  
And Menger.  
How about instead of being a snarky asshole who thinks he's better than the entire field of modern economics, instead you try reading some of the work that's being done today with real data to understand real problems?  
The Austrians contribute a lot of value to the field of economics. They have great, insightful ideas. But their books are not bibles, economics is an ongoing science.  
I think you have to go back to school, public or otherwise.

Can you please flesh out your argument?  
As far as I know, the PPF represents the theoretical limit of what an economy can produce. To create the frontier, it takes as an assumption factors such as industrial capacity and a financial system, which would assume a banking architecture that could include fractional reserve banking.  
Moreover, you definitionally cannot produce beyond the PPF. You can only move it further out via change such as technological progress, or changes in behavior which could be propelled by policies e.g. fractional reserve banking.

There's a lot wrong with the OP. Thank you for pointing out the most egregious one.  
Another error: When the 2nd person borrows from the bank (the 90% of the original deposit) they are doing so with an economic purpose e.g. buying a house, starting a business. So yes, the bank does increase the money supply, but it is growing as a response to real economic activity. Which is good! Money supply should expand as a response to economic growth, otherwise you get deflation.

Deflation for a currency is terrible.  
I do not believe in Bitcoin as the currency of the future, the use case I believe in is friction-less digital gold.

He's saying we're at the internet in 1997, so still early days.  
If you can hold 10-20 years then do, but he said he's an old guy so he doesnt have time for a bookseller to grow up and become Amazon.

A reasonable basket of goods the average person cares about? If you're going to be pedantic, at least dont be wrong. Bitcoin is unstable against all 3 of those things.

A smart decision does not remain a smart decision over time.  
Buying Bitcoin in 2013: Smart  
Buying Bitcoin in Dec 2017: Dumb  
Why would you think holding 5 years ago and holding today are equally smart strategies? You could have cashed out in December and bought &gt;2x your holdings today, obviously holding was wrong.
**EDIT: Commenter correctly pointed out Dec 18 has not happened, meant Dec 17**

Yea but given that China already has such centralization, I rather have Canadian power plants with a cut than not.  
It matters what entity is centralizing.

If I can try to clarify what he is saying: He is upset because the OP replied to a newcomer's serious concerns with a contextually meaningless response.  
Her issue was "the value of USD to BTC us unstable" and he replied "1 BTC = 1 BTC" which does nothing to respond to her concerns.  
That's it. Yes, all currencies go up and down, but not in the same way BTC goes up and down. At least not in recent history in the developed world, where this transaction supposedly takes place.

I agree the name sounds kind of dumb, but to play devil’s advocate:  
Dollar cost - as in, a fixed amount of dollars instead of a fixed amount of product e.g. 1 bitcoin
Averaging - self explanatory 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:00:34
Sure, they don't care about my $1k, granted.  
But now there are online platforms where 100 of us have $1k to give, and combined our investment can actually matter.  
In a modern age of self-serve investing, I don't see why individuals without high net worth should not be allowed to back startups.  
**Edit:** I think I'm probably wrong. There are some really good comments under me explaining why low-volume, layman investors are a bad idea. I also believe all these ICOs are mostly obvious scams, so I guess I have to believe the same would be true in an unregulated startup market.  
Maybe a better idea would be to create a platform where people can buy cuts of a startup, like a mutual fund. The owner of the platform, like a vanguard, would be the actual investor, so it's a single point of contact for the startups. The platform's owner could vet the startups, so small investors dont get defrauded, and control the flow of funds so that startups arent swimming in unearned cash.  
Does this already exist?

OP is arguing "hold is not always good strategy."  
Comment I am replying to asserts that they held since 2013, implicitly making the argument that holding is a good strategy because they are significantly up.  
I'm pointing out how holding is not always a good strategy, and Dec 2017 was very clearly a bubble.  
If the comment I am replying to were more nuanced e.g. "you should dollar cost average and hold assuming you have an X year horizon" then that would be fine, but holding RIGHT NOW when we are very clearly undergoing a correction after a very obvious bubble is dumb. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:54:53
Yea probably.  
But I think the OC was getting frustrated with you because they read your comments as equating BTC:USD stability with the stability of other currencies, which I agree is misleading.

Whole point of this is to get in pre-IPO

Calling it a "gamble either way" is ridiculous.  
Stocks are a high EV play with some expected loss. The S&amp;P losing 5% was huge news.  
Crypto is like VC funding. The damn thing lost 70% of its value over 1 month.  
Not even similar risk profiles. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:53:44
I dont talk about stocks with my friends either, but still have 90% of my money in a broad mutual fund.

Why is $5k what it should be worth, and not $20k or $0?

Right, I think the bar for accreditation is too high. Because it excludes me! /s but serious
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:30:23
Yea this is a pretty good reason.

Dollar cost averaging is correct, but usually refers to buying over a long period of time on a fixed schedule. Not trying to time the dips on an unregulated, international, currency/stock-hybrid market.
