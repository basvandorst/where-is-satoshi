It takes time, energy and effort to acquire money so how is it that the monetary cost associated with something is not an accurate indicator of its value or worth? Bitcoin is just another medium of exchange. Unlike the dollar, the value of bitcoin is based solely on the free market though. What makes bitcoin valuable is the opportunities it creates and these opportunities have yet to be realized by the majority of society. Ultimately what I'm trying to say in this post is that the true monetary value of bitcoin wont be realized until these opportunities are accepted by the average person and that opportunities created by bitcoin, like a better way of transferring money, are already extremely valuable in society today.

I'm new to bitcoin and leery of dropping a large amount of money into something I'm not extremely familiar with. To me coast averaging makes the most sense. I've bought between 860 and 550. I may be down at the moment but I have faith in the value of bitcoin. Even if it bitcoin does fail I won't be that upset because I haven't invested anything I cant afford to loose.

The value I am referring to is the importance we have placed on transferring currency. The 5.1 billion in revenue western union earned by collecting fees on these transfers is an indication of what the ability to transfer currency is worth.
