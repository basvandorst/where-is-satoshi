Are you looking to only buy btc? There are other alts you can buy with cc, which you can exchange for btc. The verification process is quick.

Canada is ridiculously crypto friendly, open to ICOs, mining incentives. It will become one of the main crypto hubs of the future.

If you're looking to quickly buy btc/eth/ltc you can use NLC2. They have a credit card option, pretty fast verification. 
You'll have to pay fees and use an exchange to convert it to BTC but if you're itching for crypto asap that would be a good option. I think there are some other alts out there which offer something similar as well.

It's incredibly concerning, even I don't fully understand the tech and I'm in my early 30s. And a man who was born before the Great Depression passes laws on it?

This judge is almost 100 years old. I'm not sure how a 100 year old judge can pass rulings on new technology than many 20 and 30 year olds don't even understand.

It's highly concerning that very old men make laws. These guys were born before prohibition and the great depression

The long term views of the cryptos that survive are extremely favorable. Banking, governance, medicine, education, almost every facet of our society will become decentralized and that decentralization will be achieved through the blockchain. 
There will tonnes of bumps along the way, and it could take decades, but I am very confident in the long term. It's the short term that worries me.

Only 10% of ICOs have been scams

Right, most newbies think the forks give free money but in reality you're splitting your old money into new coins

China and Russia are doing precisely this with their crypto ruble and RMB coin. I think it should definitely slow down bitcoins growth, but will be good news for alts.

It feels almost like it's a joke tbh....
