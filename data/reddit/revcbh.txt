We'll be adding support for people outside the US, just a matter of getting the banking all sorted out.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:55:02
The new implementation is what we use on buttercoin.com.
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:36:30
Right now our prices most closely track Bitstamp, but it'd be interesting to do a comparison over time with other services.
Btw, that fee is only for bank transfers to get money in. Buying and selling bitcoin on the marketplace is currently fee-free.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:24:12
As I understand it, one of the biggest problems for Gox was that the transaction malleability issues effectively allowed the hot wallet to leak funds from the cold wallets. We're very paranoid about ensuring that everything lines up with the actual blockchain.
Our current approach is meant to be conservatively balanced with keeping bitcoin withdrawals liquid. Increasing transparency with something like platypii mentioned below is the next immediate step. Beyond that, we have some other ideas which could further mitigate counter-party risk at the cost of making it slightly slower to move coins in and out of the system.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:32:11
To be clear on context, this is the fee for adding USD via bank transfer and is largely dependent on the cost-structure of our partners. Currently we have no trading fees.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:24:47
Hey, Bennett from Buttercoin here. The biggest difference between us and someone like Coinbase is that we have an order book. So you can turn bitcoins in to dollars (or the reverse) without going through a bank transfer. You might also get a better price on Buttercoin since brokers can add a margin on top of the price they get bitcoins at. We're working to make sure we have the fastest USD in and out around.
To send a changetip, the bitcoins have to be in your changetip wallet. We're building APIs for Buttercoin that would let someone like changetip use your Buttercoin wallet directly (after you give them permission to, of course).
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:53:52
For large amounts our OTC desk can also do same-day wires and give a single price so you don't have to worry about slippage in the order book.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:35:22
As mentions, Buttercoin can definitely support larger transactions by individuals or businesses with some extra KYC. Just send a mail to support if you'd like to look into it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:38:35
Yeah, right now it's just the matching engine, which was the original impetus for the project. The focus for buttercoin/engine is the backend and we'll be expanding it. With an API container it should be relatively simple for people to build a UI on top.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:48:09
We support direct transfers from a number of US banks. It's generally cheaper and faster than a wire.
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:30:20
It was created in response to MtGox's performance problems. The idea was to provide a better technical foundation for matching orders, which seemed to be the problem they were having.
Buttercoin.com is a US based marketplace for BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:23:59
Facebook's not required, it just autofills some of the fields for you.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:24:28
Hmm, that's strange. We aren't under very much load right now. Let me see if there is a Cloudflare issue.
EDIT: Are you loading it on your phone by any chance?
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:05:50
We're trying to cultivate that fighting spirit.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:05:00
We actually just released the first open source version of our Scala trade engine at [github.com/buttercoin/engine]( and will continue expanding it. You're right though, we don't actively develop the original node-based proof of concept anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:46:09
Yes, it's only US customers at the moment, but we're working to expand that soon.
The limits are currently $3,000 or $5,000 based on level of verification. We can also support larger transfers through other mechanisms, but that has to be handled through support for now.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:52:40
A slightly simplified version of our matching engine is available [on github]( and we'll be expanding that repo. The name was actually just a domain that we had starting out and it ended up sticking (unlike butter?).
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:23:32
The Facebook link just autofills some of the fields. There's no difference other than convenience.
@_date: 2014-11-05 19:02:50
This is code derived from the Buttercoin.com codebase for performing order matching. It's MIT licensed and written in Scala. We're starting to let people in from the wait list. If you're interested in playing with our API send us a mail at hello
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:00:41
Thanks, I hadn't seen EuronextClone yet.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:52:24
Oh, sorry. Right now it takes 2-3 days for inbound USD transfers.
EDIT: We don't automatically convert the dollars into BTC, but that's a feature we'll likely add in the future. Once you use the USD to buy bitcoins, you can send them out immediately, or hold them in your Buttercoin wallet.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:44:18
The repo linked to is very new. We'll be moving more of our codebase into it over time. There are certain parts of our production system that we can't open source due to licensing issues, but we want to make as much available as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:16:49
Yeah, I was just reading through the code yesterday :D
It's mostly just a matter of figuring out how to integrate it and having the time to do it.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:23:22
The sign-up button will appear once we get through our wait list. It started off pretty long, but we've been letting people in quickly. You can still add yourself to the list from our homepage and we'll email you with an invite.
I can't get into the specifics of our compliance yet, but we've been working for the past year and a half to make sure it's airtight.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:58:30
That's understandable, and we don't try to compete directly with services like Coinbase. Brokerages like those are able to use our platform for liquidity while taking the risk on of locking in a bitcoin price for consumers like you.
The downside to using a brokerage is that they usually need to charge a premium above the market price to mitigate risk and make a profit.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:41:05
Even though we just recently started a public beta, Buttercoin has had active trading and market makers for more than six months, since early April.
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:57:45
We started over w/ [a new implementation]( in Scala. That's extracted from our production codebase and we're working to refactor things so we can move more into the OSS project.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:25:14
FB is just used to automatically fill in fields, it doesn't affect the actual ID verification.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:24:43
Yeah, we have some ideas about doing more integration w/ Facebook, but right now it's just so you don't have to type as much in.
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:01:32
Our volume is still growing, but we already have market makers in place to  ensure liquidity. For very large orders it's almost always prudent to break it up into smaller chunks, regardless of which marketplace you're trading on.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:46:31
Right now, incoming bitcoins clear in 4 transactions, but we're working on ways to make that faster.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:13:20
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:07:07
It was just an extra domain we had when the project started. We really didn't have any intention of keeping it, but here we are.
It's grown on me, kind of like the Wii. That seemed to work out for Nintendo.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:36:14
Yes, we can prove that we have all of the donations. I'll dig up the info.
The project started off as a bit of announce-first development in response to the MtGox issues during the run-up in price last April. We had a lot of really enthusiastic people all trying to figure out what it was we were actually trying to do. Many people wanted to build a completely distributed exchange, others wanted to go other directions. That's the beauty of open projects, even if it can be a bit overwhelming.
Cedric and I already had an interview with Y Combinator scheduled to pitch a different bitcoin idea. A few of us decided to focus on building something we could use to launch a real platform and pitch that instead. We started from scratch and kept it closed to focus on that, always with the intention of opening it back up once it was at least somewhat usable.
It's taken way to long to get there. Why are we waiting for launch? Mostly because we're too busy. There's still a good amount of code specific to our deployment mixed into the stuff that's actually usable by anyone else. I'm embarrassed to admit we even have a couple of test passwords and API keys floating around in the repos.
In short, we're humans of limited capacity. If I were to do it again, I'd go about things differently, but if we can put up a technically solid trading platform that helps make bitcoin (and other digital currencies) more widely adopted, then I'll have no regrets.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:04:05
Some people are upset, with good reason, because we could have handled things better. When we originally started working on the rewrite of the project, I didn't imagine it would take nearly as long as it has. The idea was to step back from the sometimes hectic, always energetic, development and debate of the core project and build something completely focused on being able to launch a US exchange. Then, we would simply release the code for that.
I thought it would take two months. I was wrong.
The only thing we can do now is make good on having a reliable, performant, secure exchange with an open codebase and work to earn back the trust of those who are upset.
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:26:49
What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:32:35
You get a gold star @_date: 2014-03-01 03:12:27
It's a trading platform, much like Bitstamp or BTC-e as opposed to a broker like Coinbase. We try to be as little like Gox as possible. The project actually started in response to Gox's inability to handle trade volume during the run-up last April. We've got a really fast engine.
Outside of the tech, we're trying to make it simple and fast to buy and trade bitcoins (and other currencies). While we won't support credit or debit at launch, we've got partners that will make it fast to get money in or out.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:05:49
We're in very promising talks with banks on Mars and Betelgeuse V
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:37:18
We tried to come up with a different one, but it started growing on us.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:13:39
I haven't actually used Circle, so correct me if I'm wrong. As I understand it, Circle is very much like a fee-free Coinbase, in that they act as a bitcoin brokerage without having an order book.
With Buttercoin, you have direct access to our order book and our liquidity. If you're interested in trading quickly back-and-forth between BTC and USD, that's something you can't really do on Circle. Also, just because Circle doesn't charge you explicit fees, you still may not get the best price on a single transaction if they are adding a margin on top of the price they get from their liquidity provider.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:39:26
We just recently release the Scala engine we built under the MIT license at [github.com/buttercoin/engine]( and will continue to port more of our production code back into that project until we're actually running on that codebase.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:26:10
We've just started our public beta recently, so we're still pretty new. The biggest difference between Buttercoin and Coinbase/Circle is that we have an order book whereas they simply act as brokers.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:49:00
Technology, security, compliance, and liquidity.
The whole project started because MtGox couldn't keep up with the number of trades being placed last April. Our engine is thousands of times faster and we're working to improve it all the time. I mentioned our cold storage in another comment, but it's key feature is that no individual has the ability to steal coins. We undergo external security audits and penetration testing on a regular basis.
We have partnerships with large banks and financial institutions with international licenses. Compliance might not seem like a feature, but it's critical to ensure that regulators don't make things harder than they already are. Crypto-currencies will always be able to operate outside regulation, just like cash, but if you want to interact with legacy banking it's a requirement. Those partnerships also give us access to market makers to ensure that we have a highly liquid exchange from day one.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:57:01
The original purpose was to create a technical foundation that could address the performance and security issues other exchanges weren't dealing with.
We quickly realized that just having the code wouldn't be enough to get an exchange running, especially in the US. So, when the opportunity to have big name investors and banks back us came up, it seemed like the best way to create a real, working exchange.
The public repos on GitHub were hectic and people were interested in taking it a lot of different directions. We decided to focus and build just what we needed to get a US exchange live, then open source that. It's still the plan, it's taken too long, and we're too busy until things go live, but once I catch my breath we'll be packaging up the bits of our system that could actually be useful to other people and opening them back up.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:43:51
Ahh, sorry about that. We currently only support US customers, but are working to open it up more broadly soon. We'll improve the messaging to make it clear.
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:19:55
We have some other ideas around FB integration and using it for anti-fraud stuff, so we're probably asking for more permissions than we should now. I'll talk to the the team about clarifying what it's for and reducing the permissions we ask for.
Thanks for the feedback, have a beer on me @_date: 2014-11-14 19:42:52
We'll try to make the purpose of the FB integration more clear, thanks!
Regarding the CF captcha issue, are you trying to access the site via a VPN?

We decided the coffeescript implementation was the wrong direction and started over in Scala.

We never ran off with the open source project. It's still online right where it started, but nobody has tried to contribute to it for a long time. After realizing that it was headed in the wrong direction, we started over on a new implementation of the trade engine which can be found [here](

We've got a really robust cold storage system. In addition to keeping nearly all of our bitcoin holdings offline, it also prevents any individual or small group from being able to steal coins.
We'll make all of our coin holdings publicly auditable. We're also working out the details of how to prove that the amount we hold is equal to the deposits we've received (less withdrawals), just have to do it without compromising customer privacy.

The remittance angle is something that grew naturally out of what we were already (and still are) doing: building and running a global open source exchange platform. It's also easier for people outside of bitcoin to understand (i.e. reporters and investors).
Exchanges themselves are ultimately commodities, so we see the big opportunity in services that work on top of a vibrant and low cost exchange platform.
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:03:53
Hey, Bennett here. It's the same project as Although we are pretty badass, I think you're referring to Nerd Tribe. I'm not stealthy enough to be a ninja. That was the name of a hacker house we experimented with running in Austin.
We're building a business around the Buttercoin platform, and we'll still be releasing at as an open source project.
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:40:02
We want to provide a global network of exchanges with the lowest fees possible. We're dirty capitalist pigs at heart, so we have plans to profit off of this, but we don't think the best way to do that is from exchange fees alone. If we're able to become profitable from ancillary services alone, we'd much prefer to offer a fee-free exchange.
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:14:46
Fortunately it doesn't quite take $52M to be compliant in the US. We've got some really smart and conservative lawyers who've helped us build a business model that lets us operate legally and profitably in the short term while getting all of the licenses as soon as possible.
@_date: 2013-08-21 04:59:44
Hey, it is the same as and we're still committed to developing a scalable open source exchange. It's been our plan for some time to also host at least one reference exchange and we recently started getting a lot of interest from people looking for us to run a white-label exchange service.
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:22:49
We're keeping fees really low to make it as easy as possible to trade BTC. We have no upfront licensing or setup fees and split revenue from trades with the sponsoring institution. The trade fees will be just high enough to keep things operational, the plan is to make any profit from additional products and services. 
We're currently targeting somewhere between 0.25% and 0.1% as a base fee level. It's a bit of a worn out trope in startup-land, but this will be sustainable if we have sufficient volume.
Currently, all of the hardware running the core execution engine will be located in the US. It's certainly possible to host specific exchange instances in different countries, and we plan to do so once we're up and running. We will have edge nodes spread around the world for fast web and API access.
The execution engine, ledger, bitcoin node, and bank integration elements are hosted in a secure facility with gated physical access to prevent tampering.
**Goverment and Regulations**
From a legal/procedural standpoint, I'm sure the government could eventually seize whatever it likes. We don't believe it will be in the interest of the feds to do that and we have good relationships with state regulators. Our lawyers are extremely cautious, and we've come up with an operational model that we have an extremely high confidence in.
From a technical standpoint, seizing actual bitcoins will be difficult without the cooperation of several people. To cover our ass, the cold storage system distributes private keys for the bulk of bitcoins-under-management (BUM) using [Shamir's secret sharing]( We're not announcing the specific number of secret-holders yet, but to reconstruct a private key and actually seize bitcoins, you'd need to coerce at least 4 people to cooperate. 
We aren't particularly worried about governments seizing an instance of the exchange, as we replicate all information across multiple instances within a jurisdiction (as well as having continuous, journaled backup) and transferring bank funds is already under the control of regulators.
*Snooping*: We're working with penetration testers and will perform regular security audits to help ensure that nobody can intercept information without us knowing.
We won't be able to deny valid requests for information from law enforcement within a jurisdiction, but we certainly won't make arbitrary transaction or user information available to anyone without proper authorization. We will be asking to see warrants, in other words.
If you want to interact with the traditional financial system, that means giving up anonymity. It's not for everyone, but it's the part of the ecosystem we aim to serve *with the exchanges that we manage*. I'm sure there will always be alternatives for those that wish to remain unknown.
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:58:19

The biggest reason it's not up there today is because I'm still embarrassed by a couple of parts :P
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:07:27
0.1% is the goal, we want to provide as little friction as possible for people trading digital currencies. The long term goal of the business is not just to build an exchange, but to create a vibrant community around the exchange which will let us figure out the other things bitcoin can do well.
International remittance is the first example of a service we'll provide beyond trading. Other things like wallets, derivatives, or merchant services will come down the line as we can figure out business cases for them.
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:52:32
You guys have it pretty much figured out. The biggest problems someone like WU would face are costs of using the exchange and shallow markets on one or both sides of a transaction.
We're fixing both of these problems and would love to work with someone like Paypal or WU to help them move money more quickly and cheaply. We've spoken to key people in companies like these, and unfortunately their risk appetites just aren't there for anything related to bitcoin. So, in the meantime we'll be helping some of their more nimble competitors :D
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:36:08
It was never intended to be a p2p exchange platform, and we're still committed to providing a robust open source tech platform for exchanges to run. We've also always intended to provide a usable, fully compliant, reference implementation.
The remittance angle is something which has grown organically out of the interest we've gotten from people that want to run an exchange. It's also something that people who aren't familiar with the digital currency space can easily grok.
I started out in games and have a few that I really want to make, but using them to mine bitcoin would unacceptably eat into the framerate.
@_date: 2013-08-21 05:00:05
We absolutely will.
