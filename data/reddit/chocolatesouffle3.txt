Depends how govt shutdown affects the economy and the dollar supply. Bitcoin now has a reputation as a potential safe haven in a dollar collapse or in a QE type scenario. It could get interesting. Remember that if dollar purchasing power goes down, and all else stays the same, that means it would take more dollars to buy bitcoin, so obviously there would be that upward "price" pressure. Other factors, like bitcoin's utility and adoption would play into it as well.

That dream is still there. But the rapid success of bitcoin, the rapid propagation via accumulation, has led to a temporary scaling bottleneck. The people still accumulating can see the vision, or don't need to see it because they benefit from bitcoin as a store of value, and as a defense against the dollar system.   
High prices in the form of fees are attracting further development. It's the economics of growth. Supply, demand, equilibrium. The time dimension is inescapable.

The fee market is not related to price at all.     
There is the *fee market* in which supply is defined as throughput on the blockchain.  And there is the *bitcoin market* in which supply is defined as bitcoins in circulation.    These 2 things are not correlated in any necessary or meaningful way.    
In the same way, Fedex shipping costs are not related to the value of their freight, but the weight of their freight. "Shipping weight" is equivalent to bitcoin transaction size in this analogy. It would cost the same to ship a $1 dollar bill as it would to ship a $100 dollar bill.  Likewise, it could theoretically cost the same to send 1 bitcoin as it could cost to send 1 million.

It's not linked to the blockchain. It's a key pair that fits certain design parameters. It's part of an infinite set of keys which are all valid bitcoin keys.    
When you create a new one (or more specifically, when you randomly select from the infinite set), you don't need to link it to the blockchain, or validate it in any way.  It's just an empty envelope with a private key, in a sense.    
Offline generators are merely random number generators. Their chance of picking the same bitcoin address twice is so small as to be statistically insignificant. 
When you send bitcoin to this new address, that is when you transact on the blockchain ledger, and when the blockchain records this address for the first time.

Intrinsic value is a term that has come to mean something very specific in certain circles of economic discourse because of the context within which it is commonly used. Its usage is common when discussing physical assets such as gold, property, or business equity. This is to contrast with the notion of "market value". Bitcoin has market value, but not really "intrinsic value" when you're talking about the strict academic terminology.   
So I would say that bitcoin has value which is intrinsic, but doesn't necessarily have intrinsic value per se.  Bitcoin doesn't fit the old paradigm exactly.

For smaller amounts, less than $5000 or so, you are not going to save a ton on fees (especially not when you consider frustration with the learning curve); Not in the current fee market anyway.

You want an "import" function as opposed to a "sweep" function, although sometimes the terms are conflated.

@_date: 2018-01-23 18:35:39
True. I was just thinking I should reduce my estimate to 2-3k, because wire transfer fees are about 2-4% of that. Plus trading fee, and mining fee, and withdrawal fees for the receiving person.  That should still be less than 10% if done properly I suppose. But you have to add cost for the time spent with the procedure and learning. So, maybe $5K is pretty good, depending how you value your time, and how many times you intend to repeat the process.

You should start with the banks which are servicing the major exchanges. Although there is only so much risk one bank will take.  It's more the Entire Banking System you need to worry about ultimately.  You may need to make some banker connections to seal a good deal. But your banking relationships will likely be a massive challenge, as it remains so in the global bitcoin exchange industry.

You can buy as little as you want. Understand that there is a fee market that applies when you try to move your bitcoin though. It is possible to send transactions for zero or near-zero fees, depending on current network activity. Right now, for example, is not a good time.    
That said, you can create an exchange account, and deposit cash; Then buy a very small amount and leave it on the exchange until either: you accumulate more, or until the network activity and hype has slowed.

The credit worthiness of the loan is irrelevant in this equation, and so it's not the same thing. The margin positions are fully collateralized. The only way to get a loss, and one that would leave the exchange having to use debt collection services on its clients, would be if the market dropped really fast, and the exchange didn't have enough liquidity on the books to liquidate and take their collateral back.  A good exchange will liquidate before it gets that bad and therefore not really take any risk.  It could happen, but the worst is the exchange goes under because it can't collect from its clients.

Value is ultimately subjective, and negotiated between every buyer and seller at the time of sale.  However the same economic principles that apply to any limited resource also apply to bitcoin.  Supply, demand, equilibrium. There are only 16 million bitcoin in circulation at the moment, and only 21 million will ever be created.

The Bitpay wallet is a closed-source version of the CoPay Wallet, which is open source.  I suggest you at least stick with the copay wallet instead of the bitpay one. Unless you're using it for the debit card, in which case you have no choice but to give up control and privacy of your bitcoin.  You can't have both: access to the banking system with a debit card linked to your wallet; and the ability to control your money and privacy.

Again, you're trying to correlate the price of bitcoin to the price of a fee to move bitcoin.  There is no relation.

It's simple really: Keep your bitcoin yourself, or let coinbase or another custodian hold them for you.  
You either have your private keys or you don't. With coinbase, and other custodians, you don't have your private keys. So you don't have anything but and IOU. If you want financial sovereignty, hold your keys. Use any good open source wallet. Even better, do some research on the different types of bitcoin wallets to understand the security considerations and functionality differences.

To suggest it will only get worse is of course to ignore the economic and technical dynamics at work here. It's helpful to think of this problem in terms of supply, demand, and equilibrium; and for both the bitcoin market itself, and the bitcoin fee market where throughput on the network is sold, much like a shipping cost for bitcoin.
There is a fixed supply of throughput on the blockchain at any given time. The demand for blockchain throughput varies, based largely on demand for the bitcoin itself.     
If throughput remains (or becomes) unacceptable to buyers, the price will drop, demand will drop, and traffic will drop. That is the equilibrium occurring.  
The alts are taking the spillover of what bitcoin cannot take. Scaling upgrades will add throughput supply to the market, and will attract bitcoin buyers for having negated much of the incentive to diversify into alts.  
To the extent that bitcoin is being "spam" attacked (if it is), the incentive for the attack will only persist as long as a large component of buyers believe the alts offer an actual solution (granted at the moment, they sort-of do offer a solution). As soon as that popular myth starts to die for this new massive generation of crypto noobs, the incentive to create such an attack will diminish. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:59:14

You over estimate the potential for consensus on the matter.  If you want a big block size now, you have Bcash.  I thought we've been through this already.

The difference between a word phrase and a paper wallet's private key is that a word phrase generates many private keys, while the paper wallet is just one.

A sufficiently skilled and equipped hacker could definitely access the area of memory with the encrypted keys and brute force it without having to go through the failed pin waiting period.  Hardware wallets are in no way 100% secure against all attacks.   
Physical access to the the hardware is required for most, if not all viable attacks. Such attacks take time to execute as well, and so should give a prepared victim time to recover their seed on an alternative device, and move their funds to a safe place.  
As with any key, if you lose it make sure you change the locks.

Let this be a lesson. Get a wallet, not an "app/exchange". Those aren't your coins. That's a custodial account. They want you to believe it's "convenient", but that's just how they get you to give up control of your money. Any wallet that isn't an exchange wallet is fine. Mycelium, Jaxx, Samurai, Electrum, Ledger, Trezor....
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:23:26
1. wallet is yours. exchange is theirs. 
2. no, although they want you to believe that so you keep your shit with them.  thus, coinbase will call its app a "wallet"; but you need to understand keeping bitcoin on coinbase is not keeping bitcoin in your custody. On the other hand, Mycelium, Jaxx, Samurai, Electrum, Ledger Nano S, Trezor, and paper wallets: these are all personal wallets in which you own, hold, possess your keys.
3. No, unless your pseudo-wallet "app" has an exchange integrated. Its important to understand an "exchange" is a third party selling you something. A wallet is a personal storage device. You cannot exchange Bitcoin for fiat using only software; You must have an account with a third party, who provides order-matching services, or acts as a counterparty to your trade, and provides banking services. You pay fees for these services, and your risk your property by allowing them custody.

A "crash" is a price discovery event, but also usually a large debt default event. Things get repriced on a massive scale and lots of "wealth" disappears. The bubbles become apparent because they deflate rapidly. There is an extent to which crypto right now, is a "bubble" being inflated by worthless govt fiat. The same goes for the stock prices, housing prices, health care, education, cars.  When there's a crash, all of those prices will adjust. The extent to which our world is kept afloat by govt debt will become apparent, because what they thought was wealth, will disappear when the debt defaults. The fractional reserves will be tested.  Nobody knows what it will look like, and for how long, but there will be blood. People will suffer. The outcome is not certain.

If VPNs or the entire internet were also illegal, then yes. Because you'd have to shut it down to stop bitcoin. But then we would create a mesh network in response, which cannot practically be stopped.
How much are they willing to spend in police, surveillance, legal proceedings, and prisons? Because it doesn't cost much for a mesh network node, and you'd need a totalitarian police state, the likes of which has never been seen on earth, to stop a mesh network, upon which a mere seven degrees of separation gets you a global peer-to-peer private communication network.
Stopping a bitcoin transaction is nearly impossible, and hiding one is easy.
It's a war they could choose to fight, but they can't win. A rational player would consider the cost. Game theory says they don't unless the police, prison, and legal lobby get a hold of government. Oh, wait.

Every block found on the mining network is a "confirmation".   
Blocks are discovered at a random interval regulated by the current difficulty adjustment period, which is designed to average 1 every 10 minutes over very long periods. Variance caused by the randomness, and the current hashing power available, means you cannot predict when a block will be found, only that given a large data set, the average will be 10 minutes.   
We can, and do see hours between blocks; Likewise we can see milliseconds between blocks. But colloquially, we say 10 minutes.

Fees are the result of supply demand equilibrium. Block space is a limited resource, and users pay what they need to to get into the next block. The new user influx is beyond exponential, surpassing almost everyone's estimates. So, fees are high. Coinbase is terrible at "estimating" fees, and so theirs are extraordinarily high as well.  Solutions are here. The market is in a tizzy, and is in the process of responding with solutions. Some solutions are here already, but not fully implemented.

This attack scenario is similar to when traders complain about "spoofing" orders in an exchange's order book.  "Attackers" load the order book with big orders, at a price just slightly out of range of the current market action to reduce the chance their order gets filled, but close enough to the current price as to psychologically "manipulate" traders into expecting a certain price direction.  
  Can it work at moving the price direction? Temporarily, and for the dumbest traders, yes perhaps they will be influenced to alter their bids. Even smart traders should be influenced because even those "spoofed" orders are real orders which could get filled if someone came in and market bought them suddenly.  So there is a cost to the attacker, a risk of paying more than the limited potential gains.  But observant traders will notice the orders don't last for long, and so carry less significance in price.  
  The only difference in the bitcoin fee attack is the "spoofing" is more likely to get bought, and therefore more likely to cost more to the "attacker".  Further, one unintended consequence of this attack is that the attacker incentivizes more miners to come and collect all those fees. More miners mean more fee competition.  
It's like how you can win a fight by growling and posturing at your opponent, sometimes. Other times, it backfires by showing your weak hand. Lot's of growling happens in free markets. People call it manipulation, but only if you are easily manipulated. I see it as posturing and marketing and bluffing.  It's all the same. Just be aware of it.   
Set your fees manually, and time your transactions accordingly. People will always be able to outsmart fee algos.

It's possible, but bitcoin "foundations" haven't typically been well received or supported by the community. Nobody owns bitcoin, nobody can. And so it's hard to expect community to agree on stuff that isn't directly related to consensus protocol requirements. Even that can be hard.  
A better solution is just to get everyone who supports bitcoin to refer to that other shit as bcash despite their impotent objections.

No. Who said that? Bitcoin is financial sovereignty. Bitcoin is sound money on a censorship-resistant transaction network. That's not free. Nobody every said that was free.  
If you're patient, and if the network isn't experiencing a period of unprecedented adoption and global attention, you can in fact get zero fee transactions processed.  
Right now, it's $16,000 for 1/21,000,000th of the supply, plus a very small fee to move it on the network (less if you are patient, more if you're in a hurry especially during unprecedented growth periods like this).

As long as you understand that Coinbase appears as a smiling ambassador to bitcoin, but in fact is incentivized to slow bitcoin's dominance and progress as it will quickly make them obsolete.
They are slowing segwit integration so they don't lose business to decentralized exchanges, and lower fee alternatives.  They are incentivized to create a large product line, full of shitcoins which they pump in various ways.  
So use them, sure. But know they are working against Bitcoin, while pretending to be an advocate. It's not personal, it's just business. They all do it really.

You don't need to pay $20-30 now unless you're in a hurry or using a shitty service instead of your own wallet. Nobody can predict prices for a limited resource. It depends on demand.

Bitcoin isn't "coins". It's keys. They are stored on the hardware securely so the computer you connect it to doesn't have access to them (this protects it from hackers too). The hardware sends a proof, called a signature to prove ownership and submit a transaction to the network. The principle technology is referred to as Public Key Cryptography.

Currently, you're using the most insecure method of storage possible. Put them in a paper wallet which is locked away. Or get a hardware wallet.  Storing on a mobile wallet with 2FA is also much better than what you're doing. A multisig wallet pair is another option. Whatever you do, stop storing it on your desktop without a second authorization factor. And don't send them to a stranger's house for keeping (gdax).

The value is of course subjective, and relative to the currency you're pairing with it, ie. the currency you're pricing it in.    
In a nuclear war, does the US Dollar still have value? Or have they printed trillions more and devalued it in order to pay for the war?   
Also considered in price will be demand, as determined by the size of the population;  How much of the population has been removed, temporarily or *permanently* from the bitcoin network?  This will obviously affect demand for bitcoin. Also consider how much supply was lost permanently in the explosions. Lastly, network and hardware availability may play a role, especially if hardware becomes very scarce. At least network communication can be wireless and widely broadcast, but some form of basic hardware needs to be numerous and widespread.

Bitcoin transactions take various times. When it's your wallet though, you control *when* the transaction is sent.  Although you never can control when a miner first finds a block, and then chooses your transaction from the mempool for addition to the blockchain.  On coinbase, you submit a transaction, it goes into a queue for approval, then some time later your transaction is submitted to the mempool. Once in the mempool, your transaction is offered to miners.

One thing that would help is less agnosticism in the mining community. The degree to which the miner population doubts bitcoin is the best choice, is the degree to which miners will happily switch to mining their favorite alt coin if there is a profitability spike.

I agree though, I suspect we did a lot toward pricing-in CME already, since most are expecting somewhat of a replay of CBOE. I mean, otherwise what was yesterday's rally all about? CBOE was closed.

You're not "credited". You just have the keys to a transaction you never spent on the new clone chain. You're not spending on both chains when you spend after the fork date on the legacy chain. You have to connect a wallet to that chain in order to spend on it. Replay attacks are another story...worth your investigation.

Value is subjective. Each buyer negotiates with each seller. Buyers and sellers are changing all the time. Order books are limited. Buyers and sellers are limited. Things change. A buyer or group of buyers run out of fiat. Or a seller or group of sellers runs out of bitcoin. Thresholds are hit. Negotiated prices reflect the new buyers and sellers subjective estimation of current value.

It's a fork, so it's almost the same technically. A better measure is the truth of its centralization and the ideals and motives of the few marketeers running it. Compare that to Bitcoin and its flourishing ecosystem, active peer review, infrastructure investment, intellectual capital, and the choice is beyond obvious.   
Bcash is trying to prove that bigger blocks and a bloated, centralized blockchain, are better than segwit and 2nd layer solutions. The smart money went with segwit, and slow increments to block size, as necessary. Bcash went for bigger blocks now, and all the miner centralization that entails.   
Maybe it turns out they are right, but they aren't attracting the talent, or the money.   Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. I doubt it. I don't think it's a terrible decision to hold some of your bcash, but it's not a project that inspires my support. To the contrary.

One for financial stuff, yes that's a good idea. Also a TOR browser for news and information is good practice. It's called sandboxing, a generally successful security measure.  Firefox is often considered more secure than Chrome or IE as a general rule. My anti-virus actually comes with its own sandboxed firefox.  
It's important to understand though that if you get owned in Chrome, or whatever browser, they could own your whole PC, rendering sandboxing useless.  The best kind of sandboxing is using physically separate machines on separate networks. Qubes is an open source OS project attempting to improve software sandboxing at the OS level.

@_date: 2017-12-08 19:09:39
The amount of potential panic is proportional to the knowledge levels, and confidence levels of the bitcoin holders.  The more fresh meat in the mix, the more likely a panic. However, bitcoin knowledge is constantly propagating. So, confidence ebbs and flows. Strong price support indicates, but doesn't prove, high confidence; It's a feedback loop, but apparent confidence can be fragile, or deceiving.

It's not fully implemented yet. It will be months before we have meaningful results. Also, Segwit was not a fee-reduction mechanism per se.

Depends how much you pay in fees. This is a terrible time to expect a fast transaction without paying a relatively high fee. That is, unless you are sending large amounts; Then the fees are minuscule. How fast do you need it?  Blocks are every 10 minutes, so that's about how long it takes to get 1 confirmation. Do you know what a confirmation is?  I would never pay more than 200 sat/byte, and you shouldn't really need to unless you have a critically important or very large transaction.

I don't think any probability statistics, if they exist, would be useful (Also keyloggers aren't the only worry. There is screen capture, and session hijacking as well); But to your point, it depends on your specific behaviors to such a large degree that I wouldn't pay much attention to statistics.   
Broadly though, the chances are pretty low but I've definitely heard of cases where it seemed to have happened.    
This is why hardware wallets, stand-alone 2FA devices, and just good general OPSEC are so important.

There is no voting in bitcoin. Democracy is mob rule, not personal freedom.

A bitcoin ATM will usually print out paper wallets for you. Search coinradar (maybe others?) for a map in your area. Another easy way is to use bitquick.co (not .com); They allow you to deposit cash into a bank account, and receive coins to your private wallet.  Other options are localbitcoins, or paxful but you need to setup an account and be careful of scammers.

LBC has a well established premium over the major exchange rates. If your buyers are wanting a discount, that's their problem, not yours. I found it pretty easy to make profit on LBC with bank deposit, wire transfer, moneygram. I also regularly use bitquick.co (not .com), where I get a consistent 5-8% premium with bank deposits which are mitigated and guaranteed by bitquick, so it's easier and safer than LBC. Bitquick even does the KYC for you.

If you're just using one address, you don't need electrum. You can generate a single address on an offline computer, and save a hand-written paper wallet.  Paper wallet can be made of any material, by the way. Scratching the address on a sheet of metal works. That said, your solution is pretty good for small to medium amounts of bitcoin. If you want serious security, you have to use multisig, 2FA, or a hardware wallet.

I just came back to edit my post to mention fees. Agreed. The fee situation is a boon for the alt coin industry. Maybe bitcoin could have taken better or faster paths than this, but this competition seems really natural to me, and in no way a sign of imminent doom to bitcoin. Alts were going to get their chance one way or another, just because the market thirst for all of these flavors needs to be tested.

Forks don't dilute value, they increase it (like dividends, not like money printing at the fed). And lower fees on shitty stuff doesn't mean much. Fees are in directly relation to popularity, utility, and the scarcity of this resource.  
 It's economics my friend. Also if another coin "doesn't charge fees", for example, then those miners have to get a higher price for their coin to make up for it. You pay what miners are charging for their service either way. Socialized and obfuscated costs are still costs nonetheless.   
One way to get a cheaper fee legitimately is to spend less securing the coin. So there is a security trade-off too with so-called "cheaper" coins.

If VPNs or the entire internet were also illegal, then yes. Because you'd have to shut it down to stop bitcoin. But then we would create a mesh network in response, which cannot practically be stopped.   
How much are they willing to spend in police, surveillance, legal proceedings, and prisons? Because it doesn't cost much for a mesh network node, and you'd need a totalitarian police state, the likes of which has never been seen on earth, to stop a mesh network, upon which a mere seven degrees of separation gets you a global peer-to-peer private communication network.   
Stopping a bitcoin transaction is nearly impossible, and hiding one is easy.  
It's a war they could choose to fight, but they can't win. A rational player would consider the cost. Game theory says they don't unless the police, prison, and legal lobby get a hold of government. Oh, wait.

Don't confuse temporary price with long term success. Whining about "manipulation" is dumb for a number of reasons: 1) You can't prove it, 2) You can't stop it. and 3) Because at the end of the day someone is buying at that price, and if a price stays high, there has to be sustained demand. The best manipulation can hope for is a spike, esp. when compared to what real demand and utility can do. If the price doesn't drop, you look pretty dumb for having called it manipulation. Manipulation can't change Bitcoin's real advantages. If manipulation scares you, it's because you're not sure about the technology, ideas, and people driving Bitcoin's success.

Purchasing something with bitcoin is equivalent to selling the bitcoin, and realizing gains or losses. The same principle goes for alt coins.  Cost basis methods vary.   
The crypto-to-crypto thing has little regulatory clarity. Some people consider it a like-kind exchange, and not a taxable event, while others suggest a trade is where the gain or loss is realized. I think most importantly is that you realize the gain or loss at some point in your process, but don't listen to me.   
The IRS is not receiving taxes from most crypto gains it seems, so I also wouldn't trust anyone's common understanding of the issue. People are clueless.    
You should probably find an expert who can take responsibility for his advice, and not trust any single source you find on the internet. Remember your state and local governments have their own regulations.

All you need to understand is that resources are limited and value is subjective. If you're looking for a way to make guaranteed profit trading these correlations, you're not going to find it here. There is no such thing as "the correlation". Sometimes they are correlated, sometimes negatively correlated, and sometimes no correlation at all. Math, science, and statistics won't tell you what's going to happen. These markets are driven by humans making subjective decisions.

1. Before, printed money went to bankers and the investment class. Now the "printed money", in the form of forks, is distributed proportionally to everyone holding.   
2. Before, "printing money" devalued the currency. Now, it increases the value.

You're confused. Bitcoin can be divided infinitely because any number can be divided infinitely; Well, bitcoin is actually limited to the number of digits that can be stored in modern computer memory, so practically infinite but limited by our ability to express the number in reality. But it's true the supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million by the protocol, it's hard coded; It's the consensus rules everyone running the software agrees to. If you break the rules, you get kicked from the network. 21 million is arbitrary.

If you look back at the charts, BCH has been falling against bitcoin ever since its first rally. Today BCH was opened for trading on a major exchage (they call it "Bull-Dax" for a reason). The release was intentionally timed with a Bitcoin difficulty adjustment at a time when the mempool is full, and people are already in full-FUD mode. BCH made a new high today in USD, but they didn't even come close to the ATH in the BCHBTC pair.  This is an example of excited markets and hyperbolic rhetoric.   
Some people are going to switch. That's okay. BCH will have a chance to prove it's better. It will take time for all this to shake out.  The people who know, choose Bitcoin.

Block space is a limited resource. Limited resources follow the economic principles of supply and demand. Miners who find (aka "mine") the next block get to keep the fees associated with those transactions they choose to include in that block.  It's not exactly accurate to say "fees are high", since they are voluntary and not set by anyone. The amount paid for a fee to get your transaction into the next 10-minute block is much higher than usual because of this unprecedented attention Bitcoin is getting. But if you can wait, fees are still low as usual.  Scaling solutions are in the pipeline, and almost ready for release.

No, there can't be more than 21 million bitcoin. But there can be infinite fractions of bitcoin. That's not an infinite amount of bitcoin, that's an infinitely divisible set of 21 million bitcoin. It definitely can be divided practically into infinite parts, not infinite wholes. That doesn't affect scarcity any more than dividing a gold coin would affect gold's scarcity, or any more than slicing dollar bills into pieces would affect the dollar's scarcity.  
TLDR; Bitcoin supply is fixed, but there are enough parts for everyone to share.

Valuation is the wrong term. You're talking about price or value. You have clearly also never traded on an exchange. I suggest you try with a small amount and you'll learn.    
There is no singular or accurate or real "price" of a commodity. Price is determined every second of every day in every location by every buyer and every seller. "The price" you see is merely the last price 2 people negotiated between themselves on a certain exchange. Those 2 people don't have authority to set prices for the market; Only between themselves.  Value is subjective.

You're confusing coinbase fees with mining fees. Mining fees are voluntary and can be any amount from zero to infinity. Network congestion, which is unpredictable, plays a large part in what fees are necessary to make it into the next block.   
If you can wait, you pay a lower fee.  You can pay zero during times of no congestion, and often get your transaction processed within a day.    
With coinbase, you are a slave to their fee system. Hold your bitcoin in your own wallet, and then you can choose to pay whatever fee you want, within limits.   
Fees are negotiated in a free market between buyers and sellers of block space. Block space will always be a limited resource.

If you hold your private keys, you get all the bitcoin forks.   
To access the new fork coins, you will need a wallet specially designed to access the new fork chain. Wallet's have not been developed yet.    
The fork date is typically when the development team of the new fork takes the "snapshot" of the bitcoin blockchain. The snapshot captures the state of your bitcoin balances on that date, and will be the balances reflected on the new chain when it is released.   
I haven't been following this latest fork nonsense, but yes, in a way it is free money.  Just hold tight. As long as you hold your private keys on the fork date; and as long as you don't lose those private keys, you will eventually be able to access these new coins on the new chain.  
  Just look to your wallet provider to announce support. If they don't support it, there will be alternative methods for you to access the coins.  Just check back, and stay informed.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:11:26
Value matters, and price is a metric of value.  Trading Bitcoin is a service traders provide to the world, by adding liquidity and price discovery to this emerging asset class, and by allowing more people to participate. Traders play a large role in facilitating the transition from an unethical asset like the Dollar, to an ethical one, like Bitcoin.  
 So all this shaming of price talk is misguided, and based on childish assumptions about wealth, money, and success.  Ethical investments are profitable investments (in the end, and despite central manipulation that tries to intervene), so greed is good. If more people were focused on making wealth (by correctly identifying the more valuable investments), rather than language and thought policing (/clearthroat), this world would be a better place.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:52:52

Automatic in practice, but miners have all sorts of ways they decide which transactions to choose. It's completely programmable by them. Basically it's the highest fee first. But recently there have been lots of examples where miners are choosing lower fee transactions, perhaps for ideological reasons, or as a countermeasure to perceived spam attacks, or they could be trying to reduce their computing time to make sure their block doesn't get orphaned.

All it says is: If bitcoin is in a temporary bear market, place your bets elsewhere. It says nothing about which other places are good.  There is no sure-fire strategy being described here.  Just a general trading idea with no specifics. You still have to choose the right coins at the right time or you lose.   
Trading is hard, and there is no recipe. Sometimes the alt coins will pump during a slow bitcoin market, sometimes they just go down with bitcoin. The alts are more volatile, so there is definitely money to be made if you pick the right ones, and at the right time. You need to stay very informed to do this right. It's not easy.  
My suggestion, start small. Play with BTC pairs and USD pairs, and watch them in comparison to BTC. And don't assume they will always behave the same way with BTC pumps or dumps. You will get rekt.

If you're talking about bitcoin mempool, that's another story that would benefit from your further learning about the thing you invested in. Not sure what your expectations, or how you came to expect those things, since you don't even know bitcoin from an exchange.  You don't strike me as the studious type, so I'll forgo the recommended reading.  Besides, you learn better when you pursue it without spoonfeeding.

Value is subjective. Price is negotiated between each buyer and each seller at each moment in time and space. Also, exchanges have barriers to entry, and various fees, restrictions, service differences, and regulatory friction. You're always welcome to attempt arbitrage.   
Anyway often times the price action in bitcoin makes it more valuable to keep trading the volatility rather than scraping for pennies hoping you can arbitrage before the premium vanishes.

"Hate" has nothing to do with it. It's technology competition. ETH promises something quite different than bitcoin. Bitcoin is censorship resistant with fixed money supply. ETH is neither exactly. Bitcoin is the most secure network in the world. ETH has enormous attack surface because of its complexity, and less hash power to secure the network. ETH is a solution in search of a problem. Bitcoin is less so.

Assuming you mean "wallet" not "app". But no, you can't restore it on any wallet. It has to be compatible. There are a few different standards.   
The distinction between "recovery phrase" and "private keys" is that recovery phrases generate a large list of private keys. It's called an Deterministic Wallet. Your "private key" (singular) is merely 1 bitcoin address. When transacting with Bitcoin, you will be using many keys. Thus the Deterministic Wallet (also see HD Wallets) was invented to generate all the keys you need from a single seed or phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:54:34
It doesn't reset. You can use 1 for however long you want. But best practice is to change it for every transaction to help create a certain level of privacy in the chain. Most wallets try to enforce this principle. But you can copy and save the address however you like, if not through the wallet settings then manually using screenshots or copy/paste, or handwriting.

If you added 100 x 100 million to the "market cap" right now, you would be at a price of approx 13.3k usd. However, this is not how it works.   No amount of math or genius can predict this.
Price (value) is ultimately subjective because it is negotiation between the buyer and seller in the moment of the trade.   
Further, the effect on price would depend LARGELY on how quickly or slowly these people purchased from the existing order books.  If there was a rush of buying, the price would spike WAY up temporarily until the buying was over.  This is because traders would move their orders up when they saw the buyers coming.

It's a slippery slope argument. Centralization is a design consideration, and bitcoin has an evolving design structure. Bitcoin has been, and remains the most decentralized of all crypto. 2nd layer solutions further decentralize. Centralization is not just a factor of hardware. Everyone who wants bitcoin to increase in value, also wants it to remain decentralized. Centralized bitcoin has no value proposition at all.  Bitcoin having a certain level of value is the market is saying "bitcoin is decentralized enough".   
Also because centralization only matters to the extent that it harms the utility empirically; It hasn't yet.

Manipulation is what people say when they don't understand the the nature of the market.  Yes, there are people with more and better information than you, and with more money than you.    You should make your trade decisions with the understanding that the price can be moved by big players, for at least short periods of time because order books have limits. Then maybe you'll stop whining about scary "manipulation", because now YOU have some better information than you had before.

Bitcoin has proven to be fungible to a very large degree, mostly because people who use a monetary system are in general agreement that money should be fungible, and should be treated as though it's fungible.

Why keep mining? Because stopping mining would mean a hard fork with the same contentious outcome as taking back the so-called "lost" coins.

No it's naive to think it's a bad thing, since that's the mainstream narrative, and therefore the default view of noobs and idiots. Bitcoin won't be a problem until it is responsible for increasing power rates to the point where it is no longer profitable to mine.   
Power plants are wasting tons of electricity right now because of inefficiency in grid design. Bitcoin is using some of that otherwise wasted energy. Once bitcoin uses it all, rates will rise and it won't be profitable, or grid design will be made more efficient, saving power and money for everyone. Bitcoin doesn't need all these miners to stay secure. Market conditions allow it right now. It's temporary.
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:26:31

Wallet and mining software is open source. More importantly bitcoin's abstract protocol is open source. And so anyone can create and enforce a blacklist if they want. And anyone can ignore a blacklist if they want.   
The concept of money is generally regarded as fungible because of public opinion on the matter. So enforcing blacklists would have limited effect because there is little interest in setting such a precedent.  I mean, we have serial numbers on dollar bills, but nobody is really enforcing blacklists even though they could.    
Also, there are technological solutions in the pipeline.

Depends. Bitcoin contains zero private data by design.  When you say "link all addresses to a particular user", no, not exactly.   
But every bitcoin has a trail, and and so moving to a new address is not a meaningful way to break that trail.  If you mine the bitcoin yourself on a sufficiently anonymized network node, then you're private at that point, assuming you haven't made any errors in your own operational security.  But once you spend, you're potentially exposing your identity.  Bitcoin can't fix that.  
Most people open an account with an exchange, identify themselves, and send those bitcoins to their wallet, so there is a clear trail of data.  The data however, is TRUSTED to the exchange. If they break their trust, and leak the data, then your privacy is at risk. Further you can assume government can come take the data any time they want.    
If it turns out that there is a leak of that data, the exchanges will be sued for negligence of course.  That's not to say there aren't databases floating around in the hands of people who aren't supposed to have them.  
Privacy won't be easy, but it is possible.  This recent Japanese ban of privacy coins is worrying to the future potential of bitcoin to acquire some better privacy features.  We better add those features soon before the resistance becomes too hard to overcome consensus requirements, risking a contentious split and massive price turmoil.

Also, for many miners, short-term profitability isn't much of a concern either because long term is their view, or because the value of bitcoin is actually greater than market to them for bitcoin's unique ability to serve as censorship resistant value transfer and sovereign value storage. And for some people, some money is better than no money because they already paid for their mining equipment, electricity is cheap, and because of the monetary issues in their country.

I agree with your point about counting users, although obviously that's a difficult thing to do accurately without lots of contention about the numbers.  People often say "volatility" when they mean downtrend or correction. Few complain about volatility on the way up.  Nobody calls a bull run in a booming new technology "volatile", despite there being technical volatility in the movement.  They just call it a hot commodity.

Do you think if someone sold futures down to zero, that bitcoin would fall to zero? Do you think that bitcoin traders are watching futures prices to determine actual price? This is fallacy. Markets don't work that way.   
"Timed selloffs" are also of limited value. The underlying assumption is that we're all robots and can't see the reality of things, like I can't determine a "timed selloff" from something more substantial.  Further, their "timed selloff" can just as easily be coincided with "timed buying". It's all very conspiratorial.

When you interact with a system or service or utility, do you want it to act predictably and automatically, or by the whims of arbitrary actors?     
Because when you have a system, which at its core, acts automatically, then you can build a protection system on top of it that allows customer-friendly interventions, and the like.  However, you can't build an automatic system, on top of a system which at its core, acts by the whims of arbitrary actors. 
The theory analogizes quite nicely to the Rule of Law more generally in society.

Bitcoin is the only currency or asset or commodity that can be stored in such a way that NOBODY can take it from you, and NOBODY and stop you from using it. Hacks are the result of the singular points of failure, the honeypots created by custodial services like exchanges. Keeping your bitcoin stored with a 3rd party is very risky because their large holdings attracts hackers. Individual security isn't necessarily more secure, although it can be, but rather it is less likely to be attacked than a large honeypot. Bitcoin security can stop the most powerful bad actors when it is handled properly.

Ask again when the next central-bank-caused financial crisis occurs. Or read history and believe it.   
Just stay away from govt-funded or govt-advocated history books if you're looking for truth on the matter. Govt needs central bankers to grow their power base, with global and domestic warfare, paid-for with money printed out of thin air, stealing the purchasing power you've been saving in your bank account for something important and useful for yourself, family and society. 
Central banks aren't private despite what they'll tell you.  CBs are a tool of government, a corporatist institution with the power to corrupt free market activity by introducing perverse incentives and innumerable unintended consequences.    
If you think diverse open free markets can create a bubble, then imagine what one unelected guy with a bunch of monetary levers of control can do. CBs caused the bitcoin bubble, just like they do most others.

I don't understand the waiting you're talking about. Exchange transactions are as fast as you want them to be, depending on the price you want to pay.  You can buy instantly, and send to your wallet right away or leave it in the exchange. There is no waiting, and then doing something. Unless you're talking about being a noob on coinbase, because they have all that waiting period, and weekly limit shit or whatever.  Get an exchange account anywhere else, and you don't really have to wait for withdrawals. Some are pretty much instant, others run on a batch cycle multiple times per day. But you don't have to intervene. Just buy and withdraw.

As long as Bitcoin provides a real innovation and real use cases, then the price won't go to zero and people will have to pay what it's worth, that is at least what it costs to produce. And the cost to produce INHERENTLY includes the cost to produce a SECURE network.  
Price squeezes can happen in the market, but they are temporary and designed to pressure certain market participants and produce certain strategic outcomes.   
So yes there is a risk. But there are built in incentives to correct the situation as long as bitcoin is a desirable or useful product.

They are the true racists. Look at the history of the Democratic party. It never stopped being racist.

The bottom number is as irrelevant as the top number, because it doesn't take much trading to clear the order books temporarily.

Bitcoin is like fiat in that it is printed out of thin air. The consensus mechanism means the printing is less arbitrary, less centralized, but still the fact remains it is money declared from nothing.  
Bitcoin is like commodity money also, in that the supply is technically limited with the consensus mechanism. The inflationary effect however, that forks and altcoins have on the market is still unclear.  Further, bitcoin's resistance to money printing has not been time tested to the degree that would satisfy, for example, gold and real commodity investors.

You're 100% correct. Sweep the paper wallet all at once, and never reuse it. Don't pay for stuff with a paper wallet, just sweep it into a software or hardware wallet or spend it all at once.  The wallet software uses change addresses and automatic address cycling to eliminate this issue.  
Software wallets generally use open source software to prove their security.  While hardware wallets add another layer of security by creating a physical and logical firewall between your private keys and your internet-hackable computer or mobile device.

 That's your big conspiracy theory? No, that's precisely what they were advertising. No conspiracy, no theory. Just a fork claiming to be better.    
Also, yes the SegWit route was always part of a longer term plan. This involved delaying a raw blocksize increase in favor of a smaller effective scaling increase now.   
But more importantly Segwit was primarily NOT meant as a scaling solution. Segwit is a transaction malleability fix, which opens the door for lots of other scaling solutions and technology enhancements. The side effect was also a scaling improvement.   
But the technology is NOT the only thing that matters. It also matters which project has the best devs and which project has the best plan to move forward. The bcash project has been tainted with fraudulent and deceptive marketing. Bcash continues to try to claim the "bitcoin" name even though their fork was CLEARLY not the consensus fork. Bitcoin won, but bcash keeps claiming to be bitcoin. It's time they admitted defeat and chose another name like all the other copycat shitcoins have done with grace.

The confusion stems from the fact that 3rd party custodial services label their apps as "wallets" in a deceptive manner.  They are not wallets any more than your bank account is a wallet.   
There are plenty of open source bitcoin wallets, which are truly wallets which locally store and protect your private keys.  Electrum, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Samurai, and others are real wallets.  
Hardware wallets add another layer of protection to prevent hackers from accessing your private keys.

Bitcoin doesn't charge a fee. Fees are voluntary. You include a fee in every transaction if you want, but higher fee transactions are going to be chosen first by the miners obviously. It's a free market where prices are set based on supply and demand.  
One block every 10 minutes, with limited space per block, so pay what you need to get included. Zero-fee transactions get processed when transaction volume is low.  Times like these, when propagandists are creating spam transactions to further their narrative (and legit transactions are unusually high because of the fork), will mean zero-fee transactions likely don't get processed at all.  
If you're not in a hurry for your transaction, pay a lower fee and wait. Even better, if you're not in a hurry, just wait until some of this fork drama is over.

The only thing that would allow ISPs to (attempt to) kill bitcoin would be if government took control of ISPs, and enforced ISP monopolies.  Net Neutrality is a massive government power grab to control ISPs, and turn them into a govt monopoly. People don't seem to realize that regulation is the same a subsidy, and subsidy is the same as govt monopoly.  Some ISPs might block bitcoin. So what? Unless govt is helping them create monopolies (by regulating), then another ISP can compete by taking all their bitcoin business.  You can start an ISP! That is, unless govt creates regulatory barriers (ie. monopoly). Regulating is not the answer. Free markets are! Choice, free will, cures monopoly. Govt enslaves; That's all they can do; It's their only move.

No reason it should decrease volatility in the short run. It increases price discovery; Therefore, and because finding the value of bitcoin during its early days will be a volatile process with many unpredictable and formative events to come, volatility will be more tied to the actual price discovery mechanism, rather than also being tied to liquidity problems that could have the affect of exaggerating volatility when compared to a bigger  marketplace with CME futures.
So it could decrease volatility. But only if for some reason nothing unexpected happens in bitcoin. In other words, bitcoin will likely be volatile regardless. Added price discovery can both increase and decrease volatility, depending on the underlying cause of the volatility. If that underlying cause was a liquidity problem, then CME can potentially decrease volatility in that circumstance.
The CME futures market could also be thought of as a new audience.  With a new audience, you get new audience reactions.

Not sure what a blochchain charge is, but the more you buy, the less a percent you pay in fees. Also buying from a leading exchange, other than coinbase, will generally result in less trading fees.  Miner fees are voluntary, flexible, and constantly changing. If you're not in a hurry for the transaction to complete, you can pay next to nothing to transact on the bitcoin blockchain. Exchange and bank fees are not flexible, but go down, in percentage terms, as your buying amount goes up.

Tracing something is useless unless you can tie it to an identity. Bitcoin is a peer to peer asset. Even when you can trace it, how much time has passed? It's not trivial to id bitcoin transactions like people suggest. There are plenty of ways to stay anonymous. There are also plenty of ways for the law to track you down, but it takes work, and there are countermeasures. Also, "cashing out" isn't a necessary requirement. Bitcoin is useful by itself. And finally, even if they do trace it to you, they still cannot take it from you as long as you have it stored securely. OPSEC is your friend.

all limit orders which land in the books for any amount of time, even a millisecond, are subject to maker fees. If you aren't buying an existing order, you're a maker. Note however, that interface lag can cause you to accidentally make a market order.  Some exchanges have an option checkbox that will only post the order if it is sure to land in the book. Kraken, which is a shitty exchange which I do NOT recommend, has this option I believe.

Only thing necessary is that your exchange (coinbase) will support the fork. If not, like Bitmex for example, then you need to move your coins to your own wallet. You don't need to since Coinbase has telegraphed their support for the new coins, but you could.  Keeping your own keys in you own private wallet is what makes bitcoin great, but if you want coinbase to hold them, that should work as long as you don't have a problem with coinbase, or rather as long as coinbase doesn't have a problem with you.

Government is largely responsible for wars and murder. Brainwashing is from government schools. It's not religion that's bad. It's murder, rape and theft that are bad. All of which are forbidden in the major religions (with the possible exception being Islam whose prophet was clearly a child rapist) as a matter of teaching. I'm an atheist, but religious teachings I find generally very good at least from an ethical standpoint. The anti science stuff is only really bad where it causes murder, rape, or theft.

With segwit setting the stage for Lightning, which is emerging as we speak, I'd say the pieces should start to fall into place. At what point it will becomes obvious and when the avalanche starts, it's hard to predict. Soonish. Lightning is huge in that it eliminates the barriers that most people have been worried about for years.  
Aside from technical barriers, it's not clear if the masses are ready to adopt it. Obviously the average idiot still has concerns and doubts. Immutable money isn't something most people have to put much thought into. Like any kind of freedom enhancing technology, it's the marginalized and the smart who will be first. The rest will follow when it becomes obvious, ubiquitous, or necessary.

Bitcoin is immutable value transfer. Privacy features are not built in (yet). You have to work to keep your behavior private, no matter what medium you use to transfer value. You can't, for instance, use an exchange who requires identification, and use a bank account which requires identification, and expect that to be in any way anonymous. There are ways to interact anonymously with the bitcoin network just like there are ways to interact anonymously with the internet.

Free speech platforms are coming folks. Better get used to it. Try chasing down the criminals instead of policing peoples thoughts and speech. Look at it this way: you might have evidence of an actual crime. Crowdsource the detective work using that evidence to find the criminal instead of worrying about whether or not some creep is having dirty thoughts about images in the ether which may or may not be real, and which may or may not be evidence of a real crime depending on the jurisdiction and circumstances which you don't understand or have access to. "Pornography" isn't a well defined term anywhere. It's thought crime, just like the hate speech and blasphemy laws that are being used to convict artists, comedians and journalists around the world. It's an abused lever of power, but for hysterical reasons, the mere mention of cp is enough to ruin someone's life almost universally. When everyone is in agreement, you should start worrying.

Also to add: Consider Bitcoin wouldn't exist if it weren't for its censorship resistance, and so it's "utility" in that sense is of critical importance to it's mere existence. Without censorship resistance, we have no speculation, no store of wealth, no utility. So in that sense, utility is 100%.

That's a lot of words for saying "I envy those who are more successful than me". You could claim the same bullshit argument for every single thing of value in the world. Why only Bitcoin? Why not real estate? Gold? Artwork? Aren't those "unfairly" distributed? Give me a fucking break. Move to another coin if you want, because it seems nobody cares about your jealousy in bitcoin. You are free to buy as much as you can, just like everyone else. Sorry you weren't smart enough to be seeking out Bitcoin earlier.

This has been asked, it deserves consideration. But I don't think Bitcoin needs a traditional ad campaign.  That would cheapen its brand, to stoop to old paradigm propagandist methods, relying on emotional manipulation and shallow slogans. HTTP didn't need advertising. The Internet didn't need advertising. The US Constitution doesn't have, although perhaps it needs advertising.  Ads would and should be met with mistrust and disdain. Let them beg for it. After all, nobody would choose a currency that loses value, and requires 3rd party approval, when given the choice.  Bitcoin's unique applications, obvious current success (which has received tons of free media attention on its own) , and future potential, will be advertising enough.

It's not nonsensical, but it's also not innovative. This is what USDTether is doing, using the US Dollar. This is what GoldMoney is doing with gold. You're simply creating a single point of failure for custody of the asset, instead of holding the asset yourself. They can get robbed, or have their property confiscated by government. They can even scam everyone and take the money. Your Stable Coin is played out, not innovative.

Thanks for not lying, but you haven't told the truth either. You think the avg idiot is avoiding crypto because 1 mining company (not 1 miner) is manufacturing almost half the asics? Mining is plenty decentralized.  More asic manufactures are coming into the market.  What exacty do you think the threat is?  


Do you think it's turning MINERS off from crypto? Every time a pool gets around 51% and people like you start crying, the percentages start to swing to other pools.  It's fallacious to say only "1 miner" controls all of that pool in the first place.  Again, what precisely do you think is the risk?   
Miners don't control bitcoin anyway. Don't you remember how the last fork attempt went?  Decentralization won, and continues to win because bitcoin centralized, even just perceived centralization, is worth zero and every player in the game knows it.   
Further, a PoW change cannot stop asics or centralization. All you're doing is chasing ghosts, and adding complexity, and attack vectors for further centralization.   
You should "think about it", or better yet "read about it", because bitcoin developers and researchers are MUCH brighter, and have thought much longer than you.  You want GPU mining? Plenty of shitcoins to choose from. Why would that be "turning off" anyone?

You are underestimating utility. Part of that speculation in the past was about Bitcoin's potential as a political tool, as a sound money alternative, a way out of our enslavement to the central banks. But I think we have come a long way in proving Bitcoin is already having political ramifications.  The cryptoruble should stand as a symbol of Bitcoin's emerging, but certain influence.

You're over-complicating it.   
1. Larry buys bitcoin.  
2. Larry sends bitcoin to your bitcoin wallet.  
Done.   There are no account requirements to receive and send bitcoin.  Buying bitcoin initially is usually done with an account somewhere, but needn't be.   Anyone with bitcoin can send it to anyone else.  Financial sovereignty and censorship resistance defines the bitcoin network.  P2P money. No permission required.   
Now, if there is a legal restriction preventing Larry from sending you bitcoin, that's another story. But he can still do it with a click of a button.

Depends where you got them, and what you're doing with them.  Mixing is not a guarantee either because blockchain analytics firms can (and do) detect mixing activity just like they detect black market addresses.  If detected, your exchange might shut down your account.  Coinbase is notorious for shutting people down for gambling, weed, sex, or black/grey market activity.  
Using privacy coins, like monero, to "air gap" your bitcoin is another option.  The process works like this:  
1. Buy monero (or another privacy coin you prefer) anywhere you can.  Send it to a private monero wallet created on a TOR-connected computer. Now those monero coins are totally private in theory.  
2. Using TOR (preferably with whonix or qubes, instead of just plain tor browser, and high security settings on the browser), you trade those monero for bitcoin using shapeshift, or similar.  It's important that your bitcoin wallet be created using the same or similar TOR machine.  Also, it's best to let some time pass between these steps to prevent certain kinds correlation implications that can reduce your anonymity to analytics firms.  
Privacy isn't illegal, yet. But you definitely risk your exchange account when you do any of these things.  Financial institutions are trigger happy with banning people.

If you send to a known black market site, then you risk having your exchange account (where you bought your bitcoin) shut down.

You risk being blacklisted by "legitimate" services and businesses of all sorts. You also obviously risk jail.

With the hardware wallet, you're outsourcing some of the security guarantees, sort of. But with the software, you're opening up to more attack vectors, but you are in control of them.  So it depends how much value you put into your own ability to generate a secure seed on a secure piece of hardware. Generally, the hardware wallet is probably better, but definitely not for everyone. Tech elites prefer software on their own hardware with careful methodology.

You don't understand. BTC ATMs provide bitcoin in markets that otherwise wouldn't have bitcoin access.  You are very privileged to have access to banking, a smart phone, and the internet, and to know how to use it, and have the time and patience to use it all together to get bitcoin.    
The fee is how much it costs. If you think they are ripping people off, then buy your own ATMS and charge less. You'll make a killing.  Right? The fee is how much it costs to convince YOU to go do that. It's called opportunity cost. Stop being greedy, and start donating some free ATMs to the people. Or stop complaining about high fees.
Some economics to help you understand:

Bitcoin being a super risky experimental technology, doesn't fit into his investment style.  
Yes Peter shills gold because he sells it, but as with most gold brokers, the margins are super-tight, and so gold does not represent a large portion of his revenue. It's basically a utility you provide in order to attract fund investors and service clients.  He mainly sells it because he believes in sound and stable money as an ethical choice.

Best developers, most secure blockchain, best chance of profit over time. Fees are being paid voluntarily, so you can't say the others have lower fees.

Yes it's possible however unlikely. Also, bitcoin can't necessarily stop fractional reserve banking, nor can gold. I mean, as long as banks and governments and commercial powerhouses exist, they will want to create value in the form of currency, or some kind of bearer certificates which they "promise" can be traded later for something valuable, whether or not it's backed 1-to-1 with something at the moment. That's what the market wants. Of course the risk of default on that promise is theoretically built into its value, as long as sufficient price discovery mechanisms, and those organizations aren't colluding against the buyers of those certificates with fraudulent claims about its value. .

\&gt;instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?
Of course if you start with the conclusion that they are all equally as good, or better, then you  will wonder "why bitcoin"?   
Bitcoin is an order of magnitude more secure, more immutable, more decentralized than others. Bitcoin has the most capital investment of any other crypto, in terms of human capital \(devs, designers, etc\) and in terms of physical capital. Bitcoin also leads in market liquidity \(which is incredibly important\) and things like it's ubiquity on exchanges, acceptance, recognizability, desirability.
Bitcoin, despite your claim to the contrary, is the best designed crypto so far. And the market, the smart money agrees with this assessment by evidence of the amount of value currently being \*trusted\* to this network.
It's easy to think you can just copy a few lines of code, add a few of your own, and say you've created a better bitcoin. Proving it, by getting all the money to follow you, is another challenge all together.  So you think the others are better? Make the case. Bitcoin has nothing to prove to you. The market has spoken, and continues to speak every second that passes.

Not even the most educated person will have a very valuable guess. The markets can stay irrational forever. And nobody can predict the level of resistance bitcoin will encounter from the uniformed kidnappers with guns. 
Long term though, and in general, it depends on adoption mostly, and how well bitcoin is received, how quickly bitcoin is adopted, and whether or not bitcoin stays dominant. Tech improvements are largely irrelevant at this point, since we have sufficient scaling solutions to serve demand for the foreseeable future. 
Bitcoin can go very low. Below 3k, below 1k, is certainly possible if adoption doesn't pick up over the next few months, or if other negative events slow us down. It wasn't long ago we were at these prices. And if the promise that attracted buyers back then aren't fulfilled quickly, we're going back to those prices.

Email addresses should be generated with a "master-master" key which generates a subset of master keys. You could share the subset with friend so they can use or distribute single-use addresses as they please, and this would subvert certain kinds of meta data or traffic analysis.

Supply and demand effect currency value. When they print more dollars, the value goes down. It's counterfeiting by another name.    
Also regarding value: Most govt fiat currencies have free floating exchange rates which means the "holders" decide the price in the same way as bitcoin price is discovered.   
The strength of the economy does NOT correlate highly with the purchasing power of the dollar.  In fact, if you are a Keynesian (as are most govt economists, and economics professors), you believe that during strong economic times, that's when you devalue your currency the most. That's not exactly what's happening, because bureaucrats and politicians want to constantly pay for things they can't afford by printing more money, if not directly than in effect.  And that's why the value of the dollar is in a permanent and inescapable long term downward trend, in terms of purchasing power.

It may be worth paying a fee for another payment method.

Other fairly easy ideas might be Abra, or Bisq.  I don't recommend any of the major exchanges for they generally require wire transfers, which are costly for small amounts like $140.

By the time leadership can foresee the demise, they've left the leadership position and the effect of their money printing hasn't had a chance to propagate and fester. They might even be able to claim some short term and isolated stimulus effects. Politicians have ZERO accountability. They are completely immune to prosecution. The eventual demise is built into the system. Voters are so stupid to trust a smile or an honest face. It's fucking acting. So easy. Power corrupts. There is no avoiding it.

Insurance doesn't reduce risk. It compensates loss. Risk remains. If an FDIC insured bank goes under, we all pay for it. It really leaves no responsibility to those running the bank to do what's right for their customers. It serves as legal protection for bankers to be irresponsible and, for example, put the entire banking system at risk so that even the FDIC's wealth redistribution tactics would not dilute the pain to everyone who is included in this involuntary system of theft and counterfeit, where bankers and bureaucrats win and others lose.

It's true that people weren't paying taxes in previous years. So they may have smartened up, and have some back taxes to pay, now that exchanges have been essentially raided by feds. 
Although there is more than just this fact holding the price back. Adoption continues, but giant leaps are nowhere in sight. Lightning's growth (or failure) will correlate with the next price jump (or dump).   
In the meantime, we'll be searching for a bottom.  The India news is pretty fucking bad short term.

The amount is irrelevant. Yes you can profit for sure.  However there is a learning curve which I estimate is significant for you.  
 I wouldn't bet my house on it. Further depending on which payment methods you accept for your bitcoin, you MUST account for reversal fraud. For newbs without a trustworthy clientele, reversals for things like paypal, prepaid credit cards, and gift cards happen at a very high rate.  You want non-reversible payment methods.
 Accepting cash deposit to your bank account is fairly safe, with some nuances. Wire transfers are also pretty safe. Expect frustration. Also don't make the mistake of underpricing your bitcoin; Your competitors are smarter than you, and have accounted for risk and other transactional costs in their price.

"Account" is a misnomer in this case. Your Nano is not an account, but a hardware wallet that does NOT make visible it's seed to any other wallet software, including Mycelium. If Mycelium has your Nano seed, it's only because you imported it manually, which based on your description, I don't think you did.  The seed you are seeing is likely a seed for another "account" (misnomer) within Mycelium. You can have a whole bunch on the "Accounts" tab.  These seeds ARE NOT your Nano seed, and are not capable of providing access to those private keys (without a connected hardware wallet validation), unless like I said, you manually imported them for some likely erroneous reason.

Tone takes the 'analysis' out of technical. Just spouts predictions about how he feels, and what his indicators are dictating today. He never claims to be technically competent, but has boisterously arrogant positions on every technical subject.  Never claims to be a Bitcoin trader, or active at much trading whatsoever, but consistently declares not simply which direction superficially appears to have the least resistance, but definitively which direction it will go, and by how much.  
 It's complete nonsense to anyone who understands the actual probabilities involved with indicators and technicals. An honest Analyst would describe his recommendations in terms of probability; But he is always 100% sure and never has a clue about the slim probabilities he's talking about. He is basically completely positive about what is practically a coin flip outcome, give or take 3-15%.  I can't tell if he knows how full of shit he is, or if he's just completely incompetent; I lean toward the latter, although self-delusion can create some powerful effects as well. 
TLDR; Listen hard to find a single claim Tone makes which is substantially backed by actual technical, probability-based analysis. He claims to be "educating" people here, showing them the way; It's called Liberty Life "Trail" after all. He charges for his advice. Does he save the reason and evidence for his paying clients?

Now all of those new hopefuls see the real limits we face; Not at first though. Bitcoin is a complex project. There is a learning curve.

Majority percentage is meaningless. No need to stop them. The value doesn't go up with 1 person owns it all, it goes down because nobody is using it. If the distribution of bitcoin is offensive to you, then design a coin that distributes wealth the way you envision. There are plenty of others you can choose. Most have chosen bitcoin for a reason.

Not exactly, the order is already active. There is no "triggering event" associated, apparently, with this order. What you've described is a stop order technically but I suspect it's just that your language is sloppy.  
 To answer Shad0, this order is live and this person's (or these people's) USD can be purchased for bitcoin at any moment. Or not. The order can be deactivated just as easily as it was activated.   
To explain what you're looking at, the order book is public information available to everyone, and orders come and go in chaotic fashion, at the whims of all the traders currently holding funds on this exchange.

You can't know the future. As the split approaches, exchanges will prepare accordingly, and should provide guidance for such questions. Pay attention, and shop around. You can buy on 8/1 probably, maybe. The "safety" of the transaction depends on the unknown developments, the reaction of the exchanges to those developments, and of course your own personal risk tolerance and understanding of the situation. Stay informed. It is the Information Age after all.

Here's the beauty. Human values are automatically included in the price. Every time someone buys bitcoin, they decide if it's "worth it" to them. If it is not worth it to you, you don't buy.

Does he possess the private keys for this "$1000 worth" of Bitcoin? If so, your concerns have nothing to do with Bitcoin; Do they?  As for the "millions", it's possible however unlikely.
