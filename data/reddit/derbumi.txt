there is no proper accesible API (if you don't have good business relationships with Safaricom or one of its partners).
You could hack it using an Android app - which works for demo purposes but obviously doesn't scale.

hehe, let me try... :) this is a working implementation on how providers (server) could charge users (clients) for API calls.
Let's say you have (as in this example) a weather service that exposes an API. So people can request the weather for a certain place and reuse the information in their apps.
To charge for such a service you typically would require users to sign up, provide payment details, and you would give them an API key. When a user now makes a request the API key must be provided and the service charges the associated account.
In this example we attach a Bitcoin transaction to an API request to pay for it directly. Thus no sign up, etc. is be needed. - you can imagine as if you would put some money in an envelope together with a letter and then send it someone.
So much more efficiently for computers to charge for each others services directly and on demand. Hope that helps? a lot of possibilities are out there. :)

I was also wondering about a site with information like etc-eth.com during the Ethereum fork

the chances that it will recover in longer term are way higher than that you should walk away with your current loss. hodl! It's hard, but hodl!  (I still have some coins that I got rather expensive near the peek in 2013)

afaik this is not faster these days ([ 
syncing an initial chain should not take more than a few hours/half a day (depending on your computer)

nobody knows, but it is always a good time to get Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 23:41:50
yep, my favorite and I am relying on it. But I want a newbie to put that $100 rather in Bitcoin first. :) 
Does it actually support payment requests? But I actually only use it for the higher amounts.
@_date: 2016-05-10 23:48:23
yep, copay is the option of choice so far. 
But correct me if I am wrong...protocol handlers don't work on the desktop currently. (issue  Actually I've tried to look into that but failed to find a solution with NW.js. (Electron would have better Desktop support these days I think.)
imho the payments must be click, confirm and done! not copying some addresses, or scanning QR codes from the screen, etc.

"I will present what I believe to be “extraordinary proof” and ask only that it be independently validated."
no need to announce that you will do something... just do it.
generally big announcements that somebody will do something tend to not happen.

why don't you recommend a desktop wallet? 
I agree that the wallets on android and iOS are great in terms of usability but that is not an argument against a desktop wallet. 
Also ideally there are wallets for all platforms.

The post and the video show a quick hack that I've made to integrate Bitcoin, a messenger like whatsapp or telegram and the Kenyan mobile money system m-pesa. 
In the video I am paying Bitcoin through telegram and show how you can withdraw cash from one of the uncountable an m-pesa agents everywhere in Kenya.  
(Due to mainly open legal and forex questions the app is not production ready, yet.  But I love how nicely the integration works. :)

+1 for Electron. ;)
had some JS errors which are probably cause by a different loading cycle when I looked into copay + Electron. Gave up, because I had too little experience with both Electron and the copay architecture.

sounds like one of those spam mails...
I am that prince and need your help.

it is a softfork. (which is one of the main reasons for it). 
and as jump on it...wallets need to support it. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 15:15:56
so far I was simply developing it. :) But 3%-5% would be realistic. but you also have to look at local market prices. (for example see bitpesa.co ) 
@_date: 2015-10-27 10:01:46
yes, currently that is done manually in bulk. but for sure this is one of the issues I've mentioned.

Afaik Multibit classic is no longer developed and got replaced by MultiBit HD. Classic is quite old and lacking quite some features. For that reason I'd recommend to move your BTC to a newer and active wallet.
