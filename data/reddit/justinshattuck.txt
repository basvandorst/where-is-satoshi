I'm getting my SSDs for less than 40 each. Cases for 40 each or so as well. That's what happens when you spend 100k with newegg business or Tigerdirect b2b or direct to ocz.

Using hot/cold isles specific for this build setup on bread racks. Now with openair as well. Pushing 10tons over each 25 rigs. A touch over 110 tons total in the space.

I am sitting in a hotel right now. So I haven't been able to read every comment. My first iteration of rigs was 5870, then 5850 then 5830 then 6870 then 6850.
I might add that I am a great developer and more than your typical geek. I've tried every imaginable configuration including just pxe to ramdisk with tinylinux. Overall the SSD brings a lot to the table. Allows me to mess with a new distributed filesystem in the works without needed to buy test machines. The Btc rigs work well. I use 0 diabloteks psus now. 
Those are complete junk. Sent them back. Kingwin worked out well. Moving to corsairs and cooler masters for some too.

Yes. It has already broke even and profited. Our commercial power rate 2MW  is about 0.047kWh

I haven't had the time to go through and read all these comments, its kind of ironic, because I'm currently adding another twenty+ rigs to the pool.  But, I chat in  quite often as "Shatt" and you can ask around on my network size.
I run SSD because I do other storage related tasks with the rigs in the background, I run cases because I am OCD and yes, everything has paid for itself plenty of times over to make this a no brainer for me.  I am in no way concerned about the financial decision of investing in more rigs when the hardware costs are correct.
To give you an idea, I have so many cards that both vendors and manufacturers now phone me upon availability.
You can critique my preferred hardware, criticize my setup, gossip about whatever you wish; but in the end I'm scoring big in the long run and in the daily short game.
Dont hate little homies, its all good :)
Been mining since Feb.  200 Rigs is an understatement.  Thats actually less than 40% total size.

I used a batch of aerocool 120mm fans that had blue LEDs. I hate then too. Just too lazy to cut leads. Most have DC briskness delta rev c 200+ cfm fans now. Have great results on temps, but it an additional 0.5 to 0.88A sustained per rig in a case. 
Going back to open air with the 22 or so coming on today.

All these comments are just cracking me up. As I sit here reading them over my breakfast I can only imagine most of you slaving away at your keyboards. I know I made a series of great decisions to beef up the cluster more and more. It's paid for itself and many other endeavors. 
I just mee to write my full story, but I was kind of trying to stay off the grid except for people I chat with on IRC. 
In other news. I'll post some new photos today. We are building out a colo area for hosting other miners rigs. ~100/ea up to 4.1A sustained power.

I operate a datacenter, so I am not worried about my power consumption.  I use SSD for other endeavors, gpus mine, cpus work for other projects.  and I invested money I already made.
