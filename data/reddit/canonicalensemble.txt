Why do you say BCH is slow and expensive, have you even used it? Also, why don't you think it has potential to improve?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:17:53
How do you assume there will only be few entities? Is there any proof that there wouldn't be many mining companies spread around the world? Also with decreasing usability people would shy away from BTC which would incentivize miners to mine other coins, it's a free market... Also, 1 TB hard drive costs less than $50 today, comparable to couple of BTC transactıons. If the block size is kept at 1 MB and the network keeps growing buying mining hardware would be cheaper than sending BTC.

Yes, even 100GB or 1TB blocks why not? What evidence do you have that suggests big blocks are bad? I can tell you why I don't think SegWit is a good idea because it requires adoption from all wallet providers (not that straight forward) and it can only increase the block size 2x which is not enough even with current network traffic.

Well I just checked and it turns out Litecoin actually has higher fees than BCH. LTC avg $0.582 ( BCH avg. $0.256 ( In any case, the difference is not huge as it is with Bitcoin which has an avg. fee of $28 ( At the end of the day I think usefulness is what matters and that depends on tx fees and speed. As far as SegWit goes we didn't see much reduction in fees since SegWit did we? You can argue that there isn't enough adoption of SegWit however that just proves that it's not a great solution. It' not easy to implement. Moreover, even if everyone adopted SegWit today the fees would still be high because it can only increase the block size a certain amount and current network traffic needs more than that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:31
Why do you say that? What part of Bitcoin Cash is a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:24:18
Well it's not just an adoption issue. As I said even if everyone switched to SegWit the block size increase wouldn't be enough for the network. Also the adoption requires a considerable amount of work which is another reason why it's not a great solution.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:43:47
I don't understand? Not everyone running a full node doesn't mean that the network is centralized (if that's what you meant by that).
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:37:14
Exactly! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:18:13
Could you prove your arguments? It's just your personal opinion and that's fine but I don't understand why you are attacking me. I think on-chain scaling is possible and it could be fast and secure enough so that's the roadmap I support. BCH currently supports the same roadmap therefore I support BCH. What's wrong with that? I don't understand why you are bringing up the fact that I post on BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:20
Of course they didn't because it's a fork, it's not a new coin. They are a group of people who have a different ideology than Bitcoin core so they wanted to separate and they did. Who decides which is the true Bitcoin? I think it's the people/market that decides, so I don't understand all the hate against Bitcoin Cash. If people don't like it and they just won't use it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:09:42
Why is it better than increasing the block size?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:20:15
It's more like $20 with the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:48
Imagine you are working on a project with a group of people for more than 7 years. At some point you and a group of people start having different opinions about the future of the project and you find yourself in a situation where you can't work together anymore. What do you do? Do you just throw all your hard work of 7 years?
There is no scam. No one is forced to buy anything. If dump people buy BCH by mistake it's their fault not BCH developer's fault.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:20:03
I wish they interviewed both of them. It's much more informative to hear different ideas together.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:20:38
I place value on the idea/vision and usefulness. I don't support SegWit or LN therefore I select the alternative network which doesn't adopt those.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:24:17
Well, try Bitcoin Cash then (I have never paid more than $0.01 for any transaction). If you don't count the 0-conf transactions, then of course it's not instantaneous, however there are many possible solutions people are working on. One thing I can tell you for sure is that having 1 mb block size is definitely not improving the user experience.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:20
There is no end game, he was just stating a fact.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:04:07
I understand that, however there is no proof that larger blocks actually lead to “centralization” of the network. There are several studies which showed that there were no apparent correlation btw block size and network topology. Yes, it would give more power to miners and make it harder for average person to run a node, however, one day if we actually start using cryptocurrencies as money there is no way everyone would run a full node. I think for the time being increasing block size is fairly safe.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:05:46
So we have this technology which allows **people all around the world** to transact **instantly** and basically for **free**, however instead of doing that let's just use Bitcoin as a collectible. Is that the ultimate use case for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:18:38
What does "simple block size increase" lead to? Faster and cheaper transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:18:57
Any particular reason why?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:42:47
There is already a solution to the *high fees and slow transactions* problem, just increase the block size. It has been working before the limit and it still works (Bitcoin Cash). Only explanation is that there are alternative motives to keep the blocks small...
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:28:10
Please stop spreading lies and attacking people. Bitcoin Cash is **NOT** an attack on Bitcoin. It's a fork that came out of a different vision and if you really don't like it don't worry because it's a free market. If people stop using it will lose it's value... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:41:12
I am sorry you think this way but why are accusing me of lying? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:54:52
The fact that you need to calculate and set transaction fees proves the point that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a **Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System** (as it was intended) anymore...
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:25:43
Only because the network is not as large. I support on-chain scaling therefore I don't see any difference between the roadmap of BTC and LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:03:52
Please show me a single post where the sole purpose is attacking Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash was created by the same developers that use to work for Bitcoin. Here is the case: 
Imagine you are working on a project with a group of people for years. At some point you and a group of people start having different opinions about the future of the project and you find yourself in a situation where you can't work together anymore. What do you do? Do you just throw all your hard work? 
That's why they want to keep the Bitcoin name because they believe they support the true vision of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:36:21
I guess that means you are out of ideas to contribute to the discussion... If you really wanna know I am mostly a lurker and I don't participate much. But recently, for the past couple of months, I have been reading up on Bitcoin and it just keeps fascinating me. For the first time in years there is something I really enjoy talking about and that's why for the first time in years I started commenting. I support BCH because I believe it follows the true vision of Satoshi. Sorry to disappoint you but I am just a regular guy who is really interested in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:21:09
They are not anti-Bitcoin they are anti-BTC. People want to have a cryptocurrency that they can use, not some expensive and slow *digital gold*. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:55:32
Well I think the poor adoption of SeqWit shows that it is not that great of a solution. It's a temporary measure and with the exponentially growing network, even if SegWit was adopted 100%, the transaction fees and speed wouldn't be improved significantly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:22:29
No, I don't know. Could you please tell me what they are?

It's a group of people who are bullish on Bitcoin Cash and they do what they can to support it. In Bitcoin's case the same thing is done by Core developers. With your logic I can say that Core developers are attacking Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:24:54
But Lightning Network is almost here, only 18 more months to go...
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:21:21
I am just a user and here is my perspective:
There are two coins. One (BTC) costs ~$15 to send money and the other (BCH) costs ~$0.01. One takes (BCH) minutes to have one confirmation and the other (BTC) might take days/weeks. That's why I choose the one that is usable and that's all there is to it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:34
And how do you know large blocks won't solve the scalability problem? Since the beginning of Bitcoin that's how bitcoin scaled. What makes you think that after 1MB it will suddenly stop working?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:39:41
Sorry, I thought it wasn't, my bad.
