Terrible advice. Most people have no idea how to store their coins safely. I know how to store my coins safely and even I don't do it because it's too much of a hassle, so I go with a medium layer of security which is on par with any exchange using 2FA. Major US-based exchanges like coinbase and gemini back up their ETH and BTC with bonds in case they are ever hacked.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:28:21
But bitcoin already has leaders. They just led you down the wrong path.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:16:55


Well that's just ridiculous.


Same holds true for crypto.
Bitcoin is a public ledger. It's the complete opposite of anonymous.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:35:39
That's not what that statement implies. It's the same policy (since these are regulated exchanges that have to meet the same criteria) as Coinbase's which is worded better.

They aren't FDIC insured but US-based exchanges have to maintain insurance (usually in the form of bonds) on the crypto they hold.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:21:31


That's the typical thread title on bitcointalk.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:21:02
Hence "computer fraud."
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:29:22


It's not FDIC insured but U.S.-based exchanges have to maintain some level of private insurance on their crypto.

Bitcoin funded an amazing trip I took back in 2014. Yeah those BTC would be worth $120,000 now, but I've got some of the best memories of my life.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:05:57
Wait, I thought we weren't supposed to talk about Bitcoin Cash here? Oh that's right, we can as long as it's something negative.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:01:45




I don't know how much clearer it can get. Just accept that you didn't know what you were talking about and move on. There's really nothing left to discuss.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:20:01
I hope that little interaction you just had opens your eyes about the vitriol directed at anyone not perceived to be part of the hive mind.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:23:14
Exactly. You and I won't be opening lightning channels, it will be some monolithic entity that will use their lightning channel to make money by analyzing our purchases (as is currently the case).
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:30:08


This is unbelievably unlikely to ever happen.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:18:55
I'd rather bet on BCC getting a Tx malleability fix than deal with shitty blockstream politics any further.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:02:31
Nope. You really should do some research before making accusations here.

It's far less anonymous than cash.

Step 1: Build time machine  
Step 2: Go back to 2009  
Step 3: Solo mine

Why do you think the July 21st deadline was chosen? Without the users this could have been pushed forward indefinitely like it has for years now. The users had a HUGE part in this!
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:21:58
Why limit the possibilities when there is already an incentive (use less ether) to write better code.
Also, there's nothing stopping anyone from writing an oracle-like smart contract creator for dummies.

30% of miners are currently signaling.
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:20:11
Jesus christ I need to put more money into ETH if this is the current perception, and that's coming from a long-term BTC holder.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:03:00
It's happened to me personally and it's literally explicitly stated in their terms of service: 
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:12:27
There's a snowball's chance in hell of BIP 148 working.
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:17:46
Yes, that's what makes it non-fungible because bitcoins that are associated with darknet markets or other criminal activities are worth less than newly minted bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:17:55


Forever and always.
The best solution is segwit, which fixes the asicboost centralization problem + enables second layer payment mechanisms that utilize bitcoin for its greatest feature as a digital currency: security. Increasing blocksize lowers the security and is nothing more than a band-aid.
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:14:54


This doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:01:56
Coinbase for certain (I know first hand). Also the overall market is a reflection of this, since miners sell newly mined coins at a premium.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:28:06
This isn't correct. There are practically no individuals outside of the Chinese miners that don't endorse segwit (and even THEY support segwit publicly).
There are two main issues here with the proposals:
1. Some oppose the very idea of a UASF, since miners are the backbone of the network and have invested the most capital into securing the network. Stripping the miners of power and giving it to the users might make sense in this instance but it could set a dangerous precedent going forwards where there is less incentive to mine, thus risking the security of the blockchain.
2. Increasing the block size limit prices some miners and node operators (and certain platforms, like mobile devices) out of the bitcoin consensus, which will result in more centralization. On top of this, 4MB blocks are a bigger security risk for malicious actors to utilize since broadcasting erroneous 4MB blocks to the nodes has an n^2 DoS effect.

If they are running at 1-5% utilization then they aren't anywhere near their TDP. Solving SHA256 on all of them will probably push them up an extra .1KW a pop. So if your electricity price is 14 cents a kilowatt-hour and you have 2000 servers, then you are burning through an additional $672 a day.
Your servers will probably generate 10 MH/s each, giving you a total of 20,000 MH/s.
An Antminer S9 ASIC costs $1200 and will generate 14,000,000 MH/s.
So you can see how pointless your endeavor is.

How do you think they determine that you are involved with those types of businesses? Blockchain analysis. I specifically was blocked from Coinbase for using a tumbler.
You can google the issue with coinbase and tainted coins.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:32:49
You would get BTFO by a single ASIC and your electricity cost would be able to buy several alone.
