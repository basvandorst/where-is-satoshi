Thanks! I've been reading about Bitcoin for the past year and to me it feels like sub-$300 prices are in our rearview window for good (barring any completely unexpected events). But then again, Bitcoin never ceases to surprise me.

Now that's a bold prediction! (but it would match the previous bullet points, wouldn't it?)

I'm sorry you think it's misleading. I was trying to make the point that a lot of people have heard about Bitcoin in the last 6 months due to all the news-related events happening (Gox, the auction, etc.). Many of those people will be non-technical like me, so it will take them a little while to get through all the stages. They will likely have to hear about Bitcoin several times, and at least once from a source they trust. I think that will happen for a lot of people before the end of this year (i.e. they heard about it last December, then they read about it again last month, and then in August their brother tells them about it - and they finally become seriously interested). I think that will snowball eventually.
But I wouldn't be able to say for sure if it's in the next six months or not.

Haha, I think that probably means you're smarter or more well-informed about technology than the average person! Which is actually part of what's interesting about the stages. Maybe subsequent posters will share how quickly they went through the stages and we can see what the average or median is. (For me, it was several months!)
And as for the price, yes, time will tell if we are very smart or very greedy!

I'm not sure what you mean here. Are you responding to someone above? Or mocking me for being non-technical and a noob? :)
