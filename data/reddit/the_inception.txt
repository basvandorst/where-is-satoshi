It depends on the nation you live in - coinbase is located in the UK and supports a lot other countries. Recently some problems came up with German users - maybe check with there are any regulations regarding your country or even write the coinbase support.
Besides that I would go to the bank and tell them that a big transaction is coming in (to avoid your assets getting frozen). Maybe you have to bring some kind of proof of where the money will come from etc.).
Furthermore I would suggest to pay in out in rates (maybe like 20% at once, until you recieved the money in your bank acc)

I'm on my phone right now so I don't have that much time; I would recommend the ether (Mining) subreddit - it is Kind of beginner friendly and helped me a lot with getting into mining. Just read and ask questions and inform yourself for a weeks and then decide whether you still want to get into mining or not.

signed and donated - this would be a huge statement and bring btc into the mind of the  populace!

it depends on the recievers wallet. some sites (like coinbase) need more confirmations to recognise the payment and even more before the money is 'free' to trade with again.
if you need transactions to be fast I would recommend ltc, hence it is also relatively stable and way faster.

I never understood that "don't blame the victim bs" - a majority of the times the victim IS partially responsible for what happend, just like here.
If we just help him and everything will turn out fine, what should anyone learn from that. He made a mistake, and I am really sorry for him, but it still is on his own.

I don't want to insult you, but 40k$ on a computer wallet, with no backups and also not the best security systems ... 
THIS is the reason why this ransoftware bullshit happens in the first place!
I'm sorry for you, but it is kinda your own fault - maybe you'll be able to restore the coins and get away with a good lection or you will lose them all and learn something for life.

Austria: You have to pay up to 25% on your profit (normal yield of capital tax), unless you hodl your coins for over a year - then it is tax free.

I don't exactly know, but the process of new laws beeing passed is really complicated, so they just applied an existing law (for "speculative trading" (like option trading) on all cryptocurrencies - lucky us crypto traders.

some websites provide "safe-wallets" (like coinbase: BTC Vault), which supply an artificial delay.

Yesterday it showed me eth/eur 200€ price; I am waiting for over 48h for my eth transactions and it's down all the time - as soon as the network is stable again I pull out and don't look back.

if that's bitcoin, what is eth coin doing right now? :')

Oh boy the rape card, didn't see that one coming ;)
I've never said, that he is "guilty" for losing his money. I stated, that he is partially responsible for the whole ransom-bs. 
People who store important data (in this case: cc) on their PC, without any backup or extensive security systems are fault for this ransoftware beeing written in the first place.
Nobody would program this shit if there were no people who pay for the decryption.

Sure because OP's problems with his computer are in any kind comparable to the traumatic stress and mental pain a rape victim is suffering.
don't make things up no reflected person ever claimed; your post is highly inappropiate and insulting.
