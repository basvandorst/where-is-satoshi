I tried explaining that to him but i guess I didnt do it very well :(.  He is concerned that bitcoins are the currency criminals and doesnt want me to have anything to do with it... I should show him that Overstock and Gyft have ways to buy with BTC.

if you are interested i made a coursera study group sub. check it out
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:44:12
Good point.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:11:31
I'm just wondering why he didn't use a paper wallet for that many btc
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:52:32
True, but until they see that Bitcoin is worth having on their front page, they won't change anything. If everyone had your same mindset and no one donated with Bitcoins, why would they add the button for Bitcoins? I would argue this is all the more reason to donate with Bitcoin.

i made a coursera study group sub. check it out
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:27:06
I'll take it too. Thx for the heads up. If more people will take it let's make a study group

Yooooo i made a coursera study group sub. check it out

but then how does the website keep track of all the different devices?
If it really does generate a new key every time, then yeah what I said is essentially irrelevant

I know now we base the dollars value on 'the good faith' of the federal reserve. LOL

TL;DR one time pad is bad for more than a single use. OP be careful
Actually, the OTP is very insecure if used multiple times as it can be cracked with simple XOR. Usually an OTP XOR's its key with the desired message (m1) to produce the ciphertext (c1). Now if its used again, the OTP will XOR the same key with the new message (m2) to produce the new ciphertext (c2). 
Now comes the cool part. If you do m1 XOR m2, you will find that it equals c1 XOR c2. So just given the gibberish ciphertext, you already have an idea of what the messages can be. Multiple uses of the same key make it progressively easier to get the messages. So there you have proof that an OTP is insecure. 
To prove that the OTP is also malleable (no integrity), if you XOR the ciphertext (which is m1 XOR key) with a random text we will call P, you can predict the outcome to an extent. For example, given that the original encoded message is 'Bob'. The hexadecimal ASCII representation would be (42, 6f, 62). If you wanted to change the decoded message to say 'Eve' you would simply XOR the encoded message (m1 XOR key) with a specific P (so the final encoded ciphertext= m1 XOR key XOR P). To decode the message, the OTP will XOR the ciphertext with the key again to remove it from the equation (because z XOR z = 1). So your final decoded message is [m1 XOR key XOR P XOR key] which equals [m1 XOR P]. So your final decoded message is your original message XOR with the specific P. In the example to turn Bob into Eve, P must equal (07, 16, 07). This shows that the OTP can be manipulated to give predictable outcomes.

interesting. thats pretty sweet

I love how this sub adds flairs to new users. These bs attempts to create an echo chamber are getting out of control
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:19:59
This comment is made literally every time Bitcoin spikes. Keep your bs speculation to yourself. Noone believes it
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:56:48
Isn't that kinda the point OP is making? Bitcoin was designed as a  currency, not an investment vehicle. It ideally should be stable, not so volatile
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:53:30
I dont believe they will. And what's wrong with using school property? Especially if I use Windows. I can just switch user and noone will know or be bothered
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:27:19
Thanks!... but how do i see that i have $0.10 worth of bitcoins? lol im totally clueless
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:48:33
Alright, better safe than sorry i guess. thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:17:43


Will do, thanks!
but what just happened? whats with the dude?
