For the people that don’t understand why this video is relevant, here are some of the similarities that I noticed between Bill’s explanation of computers and ours of Bitcoin within the first 4 minutes alone:
1. New ideas related to computers came across Bill’s desk every day. 
New ideas related to Bitcoin come across all of our desks every day if we log in to bitcointalk or for example. 
2. Bill’s goal was to have a computer on every desk / in every home.  Dave replies, “I don’t have one” and didn’t see the point in owning one, just like most people outside of the Bitcoin space don’t see the point in owning/using Bitcoin.
Our goal is to get everyone to use Bitcoin whether they see the point now or not.
3. Dave asks how long before others did Bill realize that computers had potential/value? 
Bill explains that there were a small group of people that saw what computer chips could do as they became more powerful. They felt like a special group of people because they were all working on it and knew that in the future it would solve problems around the world. They kept working on it for years despite their critics. 
Early Bitcoin adopters were also a small group of people that saw value in Bitcoin’s technology with the ability to solve problems around the world, continuing to work on it despite critics… In my opinion we’re still a relatively small group working on the Bitcoin project.
4. Dave says, “it’s easy to criticize something you don’t fully understand which is my position here (on computers).” 
This is exactly like most of the talking heads that currently attempt to discuss Bitcoin in today's media.

Computers were invented long before 1995 yet Gates' goal was *still* to make it so everyone owned some form of computer in the future whether they realized the potential of them or not. Bitcoin is currently much younger than computers were in 1995 but the potential is just as great or greater. Things take time...

That video only included one piece of the interview which is why I posted the longer version.

Go over it until you understand most, it's worth it. There's also audiobooks you can listen to on youtube if you don't always feel like reading it: Here's one:
