I currently work in the financial industry (for now). I first heard about bitcoin in 2010, while hanging out on a libertarian forum (I was in college at the time). I've delved in bitcoin again a few months ago, and this time it's for good.
I've spent the last few months trying to introduce some colleagues to bitcoin, and I can tell you that it's extremely difficult for them to envision the disruptive potential of bitcoin; and all the Andreas videos in the world couldn't convince them - I've shown some of these videos to some of my colleagues, and they're like, *meh*.
There's an enormous cultural gap between the bitcoin community, and the financial industry. It's not a myth, it's really huge. It lies in "us" (the bitcoiners) leaning much more towards libertarianism and anti-authoritarianism, having much less respect for authority figures and sources in general, and being more technically literate. Most of "us" aren't fiat-rich either; so we don't have much to lose, and everything to gain from crypto-currencies. I think it's also got a lot to do with the fact that it takes some special psychological traits to be an early-adopter of any technological innovation in general, including bitcoin.
In my case, i think that the gate that brought me into the world of cryptocurrencies was libertarianism. I've considered myself a libertarian since my college years, and my passion for libertarian ideals has only deepened since.
