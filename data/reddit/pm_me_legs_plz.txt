Unbelievable how much people in this sub trade, regardless of where they bought. Like what, is this how you treat the rest of your equity? Would you day trade stocks like you do with Bitcoin? No, time has shown that that's a failing investment strategy. These posts just confuse the shit out of me

That's not true...... It's because bears sleep, and bulls rush.  It's not complicated. 
I thought this was a joke until I started reading the comments
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:33:57
I too, read the article
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:36:37
And? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:29:41
Only sane person here...

No, it's not...
Requiring you to pay taxes doesn't equate to government control of your property. A county/state could eliminate property taxes if it wished, for example.

Holy fuck that was the first thing I thought of!! You da man

Can we get this absolute unsubstantiated horseshit banned from here? Coinbase has brought in more people to bitcoin than any other service I know out there. One of the only major exchanges without a huge Scandal or huge delays and purchases, and it just fucking works.
I don't know what your motive is, but it's surely not helping bitcoin.

Leaked hacked dnc documents and engaged in a russian campaign to assist in the election of Donald Trump?
Did you not hear the FIVE different US intelligence agencies conclude this?
Maybe your MAGA hat is a size too big if you're that blind.

Wearing your MAGA hat right now?

Oh no.... You're retarded ��

They're up to 40% of the total ransaction sometimes.....
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:59:31
This. OP just wants less competition because BTC is stagnating due to fees

I mean.. He kind of is? Unless he gives away PI in his comments or something 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:24:28
I don't think OP has said anything negative
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:57:25
Probably just supplemented. He said he'd buy during dips, too. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:23:55
By volume, though. Not per capita

If you're pouring money into some magical internet coin for anything other than profit, you're a fool. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:55:10
Literal lol, exactly what I was thinking. It's ANGLED! 
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:31:25


@_date: 2018-07-30 11:43:56
Because you're dumb. Nobody's buying Bitcoin for anything other than their own benefit
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:49:47
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:49:52
Um.... OK?
Capitalism doesn't succeed because of the greater good. It succeeds because of self-interest.
The same goes for BTC. Why do you think people would get into something like this? To lose money? Because of the difficulty of transactions?
Self-interest and the growth of bitcoin are not mutually exclusive

Is there any way I can back my coins up while they are still in my coinbase wallet?
I guess u may have mis-phrased my initial statement; is there any worry of losing my coins to *coinbase*? After Mt. Gox etc I'm unsure how safe these apps/sites are. Also... Am a noob when it comes to cryptos.
