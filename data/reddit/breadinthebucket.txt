Everyone can take a bitcoin code and modify it, and the miners decide if they accept upgrade or not. If not there is a fork (soft, hard or code fork). If yes there is an update. Official source is from large group of developers working for bitcoin foundation

In regular hardforks you own all forked coins when having your private key. „Claiming” is often only moving coins on separate chains to separate addresses. But they are yours at the moment of fork and sometimes you can and want to mobe them or not

Remember to move all coins to new addreses before

There is nothing wrong with inequality. People are not equal. Some stupid people think that world is a place with constant sum of wealth. But with increasing human work the total amount of wealth is also increasing.
Everyone now in major part of the globe has water, food, car, clothes. Some of them are better and worse but all world is increasing minimum and average wealth. 
And yes, its true that the biggest companies are having bigger increase in wealth but they pay also hige amount to their workers and give them jobs.
Thats about economics and society. And about bitcoin: its less than 1% of all worlds money.

But that users who use standard power use it in countries where electricity is cheap. Power plants sell electricity for almost free cause it will be wasted if noone uses it.

BULLSHIT: More than 75% of bitcoin energy used to mine is from renevable sources like wind, water, sun and rest of it is mostly in countries where they generate too much energy and to not waste it they sell for very cheap prices.

Over 75% of energy used to mine bitcoins is from green sources (water, sun, wind) with 0 emmision. Also huge part of remaining 25% is using cheap electricity which was produced and to not waste it, they just sell it for free. Some places in russia also use this as heating machines.

Have you recovered all forks?  
Can pass you info on DM what is valuable and where to sell :)

It depends on the country. In my country the business should take official bank rate for the payment at the end of the day or the day after the payment. But in crypto there is no official rate, also there is no end of the day like normal stocks.
There are third party payment providers where you can register and customer will pay to them and business gets money from provider and pay taxes for normal 5$ item.
Last option is to print normal rexiept with tax for 5$ sandwich and pay tax for it from the owners money. And the owner will take btc to his private pocket.
