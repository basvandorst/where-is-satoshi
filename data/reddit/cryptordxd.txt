I agree that so much is in the pipeline and adoption has not even scratched the surface. I believe current BTC price is a good entry point, but I would not recommend going all in by any stretch, I believe it would best to wait for weekend to see where price takes us and perhaps set limit buy orders and build BTC stack gradually in current market.

Laptop recommended, you can then see what is happening on screen more easily, just place a limit buy order under current lowest selling price in order book, and hover over cancel if you feel price is heading further down to reduce your bid. Always double check the amount entered and do not spend more than you can afford to lose.

The old news is being spammed on Reddit, by people who do not search to see if already posted, most likely the posters just want BTC to drop a bit so they can buy at cheaper price after recent positive news and gains in crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:41:23
Depends on your perspective or are YOU talking to YOURSELF.
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:54:01
You cannot mine Bitcoin directly without investing thousands in ASIC. You can mine alt coins with CPU eg monero aka cryptonight on a decent CPU (laptops, mobiles not recommended and you will not get good returns even on a laptop which are not recommended for 24x7 mining) My AMD Ryzen 1700 cpu is only earning approx 0.40p a day at the moment before electricity it used to be 3-4 x that in January. To mine other algorithms you need AMD or Nvidia GPU's 1060s as a minimum or 1070, 1070TI, 1080 or 1080TI, which are not cheap even second hand. In the current market mining returns are at a low level due to increasing mining difficulty getting a ROI on hardware purchases is taking longer and longer and electricity costs for GPU mining have to be accounted for. In current market you are better investing buying bitcoin on an exchange when bitcoin, ether, litecoin dip in price if doing so do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Coinbase in USA or Coinfloor in UK are two that spring to mind, you must register bank account and proof of ID on both. If you buy crypto it can be stored on a Ledger Nano S or Trezor in both cases only ever buy these devices from the manufacturer as the devices can be compromised however both are only required if holding a large value of crypto see vendor websites for more info.

2 or 3 pumps yesterday, not sure pumps help BTC break resistance levels after BTC has failed to hold above $11500 and clear $12,000 recently. Range bound works for day traders rinse and repeat, not so HODL's or those hoping for a new ATH, BTC sure is an exciting ride.

You are incorrect, no concern required. No Gox BTC sales until September 2018 is a fact. Anyone care to monitor so people do not give you wrong information can bookmark

Facebook is big and it and its share price will recover after shares took a nosedive last week, if anything now is a good time to buy facebook shares but perhaps for those looking for % gains crypto and Bitcoin in particular could yield decent returns if those investing are prepared to be patient for a year or more.

While product may prove a useful tool I would be surprised if many people will part with $49.99 a month for something that might work. Perhaps you should accept crypto payments or reduce monthly price and ask for voluntarily crypto donations. if the service helps save/make people money donations could be forthcoming. Not for me but good luck with it.

Recent lower price I suspect may have in part been driven lower due futures expiring today this is a risk in an as yet an unregulated market. Price drop and lowering price suits futures traders.

A thoughtful post, consider putting your energy into posting more like this would be a better use of your time rather than pump/dump. Volume is still lacking in time it may prove anything under $10k is a good price but with market indecision the price could just as easily go back to $7k as surge to $10k. Those new to crypto should certainly invest carefully and avoid FOMO as well as trying to avoid panic selling when price moves $100-$500 a regular occurrence.

Good news indeed, the last Mt Gox BTC dump now for a while, lets see where the market moves now.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:55:02
HODL case made :-) although selling a % of BTC owned when significant drops happen to accumulate more BTC perhaps the way to go. BTC is the only crypto I want more of, other top 10 coins may also have some real world use cases, imo BTC is digital gold and cannot see this changing. IMO good times ahead for BTC in 2018 and beyond with a growing market dominance and Lightning network. All we need is true volume, less FUD, sensible regulation and perhaps institutional funds or good old FOMO can take us to the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:06:33
Hi subscribe or just copy/paste into a spreadsheet to monitor if total BTC changes, it should not until September 2018. I spotted this link from a 3rd party and thought worth watching.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:54:43
This price prediction will not happen, support/resistance levels way above this and mining operations and big investors do not want BTC fail, they may wish to see alt's dip further either to grow BTC dominance on the rise and/or buy up the alt's but have you seen the cost to mine 1BTC? The current price will likely dip a bit further but at some point good old FOMO will kick in perhaps as soon as the G20 crypto meetings pass on Monday and Tuesday perhaps April onwards who knows but I do not believe we see sub $5000 again other than an exchange being hacked (heaven forbid) HODL.

Yep, another pump may follow though as is often the case if not on a Sunday. I always try to remember BTC has come so far with huge gains. December/January probably not a good basis for comparison after futures launch and FOMO on overdrive late 2017, but look where BTC is now compared to nearly all of 2017 upto and including October. Better times will return we just have to be patient atm.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:26:27
Saw below link posted on a Reddit post to webpage to monitor Mt Gox wallets. Although the next hearing has been delayed until September 2018 so no BTC dump anytime in immediate future.

Twitter to follow Facebook and Google in banning ICO advertisements. Is this bullish or bearish news for crypto main coins ? The less scam ICO's advertisements on Facebook, Google and Twitter will mean less people being scammed by illegitimate ICO's which can only be a good thing, although some genuine businesses will be unduly impacted by this. I believe in the long run this will be a good thing for BTC, ETH, LTC etc.

G20 meetings Monday and Tuesday I understand, hopefully outcome of meetings is a sensible largely hands off approach, with no extreme FUD being spread as a result. Responsible regulation and a largely hands off approach are required to ensure innovation can thrive, countries that play hard ball will only stifle innovation hurting the economy. Countries should embrace crypto and the blockchain. Crypto is not going anywhere regardless of the G20 and other meetings like it. It sure will interesting to see what is discussed however.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:14:36
Perhaps devs can make the blockchain itself identify and remove such content one can only hope something can be done.

That is old news, that is being spread over Reddit by those wanting price to drop again so they can buy.

Complicated maths Equations ;-) however I believe without GPU mining hashing power would be even more controlled by ASICs mining and even greater crypto price manipulation. Hopefully Nvidia (or AIB's) will release more crypto specific cards like the Nvidia P102-100 Inno3D being the latest to free up supply to give gamers a greater chance to purchase current or next gen cards at MSRP. It looks like next Nvidia cards are Q3 2018 though :-) which will likely sell out meaning best chance is to place pre-orders at several retailers and cancel when one order is confirmed. At least some retailers are limiting cards to '1' per customer and this will likely be a trend which continues.

The 10,000, 9000, 8000 are psychological price points (how I like most long for 10k now) While I am not a chart guy, the support/resistance levels and volume are more of an indicator as to market sentiment and where price is headed than the 1000 price points in the battle between bull/bears. BTC has a lot of support and growing market dominance as the "digital gold"

Plenty of people have made predictions some 25k, 50k, 100k, 250k and so on, all a guessing game albeit most are a kind of calculated guess rather than finger in the air. What cannot be ignored is % gains in what is still a fledgling asset with vast potential for the blockchain technology with improvements in the scalability and growing adoption ahead we can hope to moon but mass adoption of blockchain is the bigger picture and an exciting world changing prospect.

My 2 cents worth with Indian banking mandate and tax season this month the selling pressure will surely drive price down. The question is how far down and to what extent Bitcoin will recover. So many waiting for the bottom. Perhaps now is a good time to sell and buy back later as Bitcoin is unfortunately failing to hold above $7000 and is getting very close to testing February lows.

Would any dads in this daily consider saving Bitcoin for your children's 18th or 21st birthdays?

Anything newsworthy possibly causing price to drop quite quickly?

A reference was posted to this earlier in this daily but I really do hope Spain seeking crypto buyer details from exchanges and bank accounts does not spook the market too much and surely how long before other EU countries follow suit

More money can be raised by governments with higher crypto prices via taxation, trying to suppress or even destroy crypto and with it the crypto communities/general public's belief in benefits of the blockchain with it should not be anyone's interests, whales, large mining entities or those in power. The downtrend does make me wonder though.

$7500 failed at first attempt but Bitcoin will rise again the only question is when. Once we break $7800 watch it go.

Volume under 9k on GDAX, so many waiting for sub $6500 and surely an inevitable pull back.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:40:18
Will BTC pass and hold above $7100 today before a potential rally to $7500? what do you think.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:09:47
Those that are trying to move the market upwards are hoping FOMO kicks in and in the meantime are happy to rinse repeat $6400-$7200 and back and forth until FOMO or positive crypto news takes the market and BTC higher. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:40:36
Thanks I wonder if other EU countries will follow suit (UK for me)

Short term obstacles IMO if BTC breaks $7500 (so close) and clears $7800 we may have the start of a bull run. The next 12-24 hours should give us a clearer picture if we are heading back to $6-$6700k or and onwards to $8k and beyond.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:23:29
What is lowest and highest amount you paid for Bitcoin. To start myself I) LOW = $6590 II) HIGH = $9425 or III) Waiting to buy first bitcoin (waiting for bottom) Note no need to post BTC amount just price paid in USD for comparison.

Here is one take on 15 cheapest countries to mine 1 BTC. This does not include outlay for hardware using either GPU's for mining alt coins with services such as Nicehash where profitability for miners has dropped significantly or dedicated ASIC machines or refreshing hardware to increase a miners hashing power and to keep up with increasing mining difficulty.

Yesterday only $300 between low/high in daytime hitting just over $6900, repeatedly failing to hold above $7000 recently, the tax season and yesterday's India banking news is telling me to wait for bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:54:42
I thought we would be good for a while post G20 and perhaps a recovery may still happen before then. The next potential negative could be around June/July Re South Korea taxation framework and G20 countries aim to have a plan on how to tackle crypto both could spook crypto markets, stifle market cap and wider adoption.
