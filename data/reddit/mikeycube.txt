Or just press prntscr and paste it into paint. Then upload it directly to Reddit.

If you're taking a picture of a computer screen, you have to get the angle right to avoid lines and discoloration. Then you get to catch flak for taking a picture of your screen.
1. Prntscr
2. Open paint, ctrl-v, ctrl-s, enter
3. Upload to Reddit.
Because who doesn't already have Reddit open?

I don't have alt buttons or a numpad on my phone :(
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:46:10
This guy gets it. We have emojis but not "not-equal-to" on the keyboard.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:28:54
Son of a bitch. I value my battery too much. Same reason I don't have tinder or Facebook. I have priorities like refreshing my coinbase widget.

I actually liked this version of the app rather than the current.

You can buy 1/167000 of a commercial? /s

So you're 100% positive that the USA can back all of its physical money?
Also, Newegg and steam have accepted Bitcoin for a while now; through every dip.

He's running a mode on RPi and probably has that and his phone connected to either his cars wifi or an open access point. He SSHed (wireless command line essentially) into his RPi and typed the command to sync the node.

To be fair, not many people had a spare room to hold their entire computer in 1943. Or even know how to run one or what one was.
Sounds like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:19:09
The pi is always on. Idk what internet source it's connected to, but that's the idea. He only uses his phone to issue commands to the node.
Edit: if you look at the top of his phone, you can see his node can't reach the internet. 
I actually don't know much about nodes. Just how they work very basically.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:13:45
Yeah, probably. But the Pi's only job is to hold the node. If he wanted to, he could've purchased a cheap Android and set up a Linux client. Still needs a remote connection though.

They're scared it'll drop again. They don't know what Bitcoin is and how the coming changes will effect it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:35:22
Thank you.

All the people that bought at 2900 last time are getting off the ride.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:41:40
Not worth unless you have multiple top of the line GPUs. 
But most pools have instructions and recommended miners.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:51:16
Yup. You'd need a GPU that's future proof. The difficulty will keep rising and it'll never be worth. Even for ASICs imo.

It's like claiming to be the best boxer and being told to prove it in the ring. Then saying that you don't have to prove you're the best boxer.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:25:05
It's a good thing no one really knows this.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:08:38
Check out the bitcoinmining subreddit
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:54:10
Not bad. Have you tried mining any other coins? LTC?
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:32:43
On their website, it recommends keeping a paper backup. The device has good temperature durability, but is NOT waterproof. It's also vulnerable to being broken/crushed. It isn't military grade anything. It's just tech inside plastic.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:46:15
Why don't they use government tech to create a new coin? Or better yet, mine Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:38:22
Anyone could blend their coins. Or trade for whitelisted coins? 
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:13:07
In reality, there's nothing you can do. The ransomers will have the coins sent through a blender and redistributed in different amounts at different times. 
Those coins don't have to be sold on an exchange. They can be sold for cash on the Dark web or IRL.
