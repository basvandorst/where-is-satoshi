Many of the most loving, kind caring people I know are Christian, many of them are atheist, heck I even know a lot of Muslims in that category. Seems to me these are traits which are common to humans rather than any particular belief structure.

Perhaps in the modern day that comparison is less common, but I live in a country where the greatest opposition to gay marriage came from the churches. Many Christians certainly raise their children to be homophobic.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:15:59
I disagree that people should be able to hold any beliefs unchallenged. If some beliefs are absurd, used to indoctrinate children, used to control and manipulate, exploited for financial gain or used to deny freedoms to others, I'd argue we have a moral duty to challenge those beliefs and the world will be a better place for it.

You should visit Kentucky, they spent many millions building a "full size" replica of noahs ark and teach everyone who visits that it is literally a true story. There are a lot of gullible people out there.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:12:41
I had a similar journey from raised Christian to seeing through all the propaganda and control. I like this gift. I'd be inclined to do something similar and when the child was old enough, use the absurdity of noahs ark as a literal interpretation to plant some seeds of skepticism.

Funny how every biblical quote that makes Christianity has always been "interpreted wrong". The mental gymnastics people will perform to convince themselves of this nonsense always impresses me.

I've not suggested anybody shouldn't be allowed to believe what they want. What about people who want to raise their children to believe people of other races are inferior? Should we just not challenge that?

If a quantum computer ever looked like being able to break Bitcoin encryption, the encryption method can be changed. As long as everyone shifted their coins to the new encryption before the old one was broken, everything would be fine.
There would be a potential goldrush on any coins which hadn't been switched.
However, it is unlikely that coins  in addresses that have never been spent could be broken - only those addresses that have signatures published on the blockchain that a machine could work backwards to crack.
In summary, developments of Quantum computers are not a cause for alarm or concern, and all problems are solvable.

Alan has $1000 and wants to pay Barbara $500.
Currently the bank updates Alan’s balance in their database to $500, and Barbara’s to $500. We must trust the bank to be honest.
In Bitcoin, Alan writes a note saying he wants to pay Barbara $500 and sends it to everyone.
Everybody also keeps a copy of every single valid note that has ever been written (the blockchain).
Everybody checks through their old notes to make sure Alan has $500 to send, and if he does they add his note to their collection.
For privacy and uniqueness, Alan calls himself 1H2zNWjxkaVeeE3yX6uVqng5Qoi6gGvYTE.

In that the vast majority of code submitted to Bitcoin Core, a proven reliable and secure software, has been by other people.
As much as I make many subjective claims, "best visionary" is extremely subjective. Core believe his vision leads to centralisation.

I don't actually think raising the block size to 2MB would 'ruin' Bitcoin, the most likely road to ruin would be, new, inexperienced developers happy to go along with popular opinion in the face of intellectual concerns. A potential ticking time bomb, but also a potential new era of success and growth - we just don't know. This is bigger than a block size debate.

So do you think it is an argument where the non-technical public masses are sufficiently equipped to understand the technical implications of each proposal and opt for the best option in Bitcoin's long term interests?
Or do you think technical decision making is best made by people with the experience?

Gavin has to Core. Jeff has 6 commits to Core. But that's irrelevant, they do not have consensus amongst Core developers, otherwise we wouldn't be having this debate.

I agree with your assessment, I'm really trying to get "popular opinion" to think very carefully about whether they are fully equipped to consider said trade-offs.
I actually think, contrary to popular opinion, this entire process and debate is very healthy and will ultimately prove a strength of Bitcoin.

Its not that simple, as I understand nodes operate on first seen safe by default. Therefore, any second transaction will not currently be relayed by existing nodes and so probably rarely make it as far as a miner.

That's probably a reasonable point. I read headlines that contain 'failed experiment' and I interpreted it as a deliberate provocation that deserves a harsh but objective critique. That's all I meant to attempt, but I will try to be nicer in the future. Thank you for your thoughts.

It's not pedantic. You make the point, its about balancing disincentives. We need to be balancing from the correct parameters - assuming a uniform doubling of Internet performance is not a valid assumption.
I am in favour of a hard fork block size increase I think overall. I just can't support an argument made, even if I support it, that is wilfully misleading. We need more integrity in the discussion.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:18:14
One reason is that people may not have enough remaining Bitcoin in the outgoing address to add any further fee, but under full RBF could change the fee and stop it getting stuck in the system.
0-conf is still possible, merchants could just refuse to take a 0-conf risk of RBF transactions, since RBF is optional and opt-in.

OK, its distracting from the important issue. I will delete.
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:15:47
They don't need to agree. Every single developer can individually state what they think would be a sufficient tipping point to implement an emergency hard fork - then we can all decide for ourself whether there is any consensus within Core.
I'm not asking for them to agree to a threshold, I'm just asking for some sort of indicator of where they all stand.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:32:03
Even if manipulated into the "wrong" option, consensus will always resolve itself.
There will always be a group with a decentralised goal for Bitcoin. If the consensus becomes to fear the creeping centralisation, that goal will swing back into consensus.
Bitcoin is never going to "stop working" by its nature, its in its early stages of a long and complex journey, growing pains are inevitable, but there is nothing else like it, and no alternative that would not face exactly the same challenges. The technology is still revolutionary.

It's hard to envisage the complete disintermedition of financial products like mortgages - you need external services such as a credit reference.
Perhaps credit referencing will become embedded in a smart blockchain as a public service.
It is possible - even probable that you will be able to get a mortgage without a bank (you already can for social loans), but you'll need to find willing lenders on a marketplace which would be facilitated smart contracts.
If you know somebody who wanted to loan you the funds directly you could set up your own mortgage contract with them however.

They seem to have the same goal of an Ethereum style smart contracts with Bitcoin as the current, but with different implementations.
Rootstock plans to use sidechains - this will allow it to have its own blockchain that can have a higher frequency.
Counterparty will piggyback on the bitcoin blockchain, which should allow all the security of Bitcoin, but possibly limits it to 10 minutes between blocks.

He could clear things up even more by answering some of the above reasonable questions.
Bitcoin is a community of critique and scrutiny - this is good for Bitcoin.
If you have a low standard of proof, that's on you.
If Gavin Andresen chooses not to explain the process he used, his reputation will take a hit. That's just a fact, it has nothing to do with bashing, it is just reasonable scrutiny in a network where objectivity is important. So far we've had very little objectivity.

I agree... except why he would go to the trouble of making everything up. If Kleiman is Satoshi but Wright can convince people that he is and that Kleiman was looking after 1.1 million bitcoins for him in trust - this explains why he would go to all the trouble he has.

It's not immutable in the sense of the rules were not supposed to change. The goalposts are definitely getting moved.
The original Ethereum blockchain is still immutable and will continue. They've got the worst kind of contentious hard fork... a permanent, unresolveable one. Although worse is a relative term, they'll both have their values and uses, the big risk is that the split does long term damage to the value and credibility of both.

It's risky because if that person has misjudged support and dumps all their coins to make them valueless, they could then regain value and they would lose out. Dumping coins is a gamble that it will have a lasting impact AND increase the value on the other side of the fork.
