Shouldn’t his estimated worth just be 79 bitcoin?

Smart move. Pens are a terrible investment rn

Do you really believe that about ethereum? Dude get out of crypto ��
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:40:35
Where do you spend your bitcoin? Like would coinbase be sketched if I use it to purchase from a tor website? Not silkroad or anything its just a novelty ID website from some guy who's really careful
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:54:35
We are all satoshi 
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:14:11
So are there any limits as to where or how I can spend them? Just asking cause you said technically they're coinbases coins not mine
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:50:46
Now Im scared to do it.. haha 
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:48:29
Are there any free mixers out there? Could I just send money from coinbase to my blockchain account and then purchase from blockchain? Would that be ok? I know its not mixing but it would get coinbase off my back right? I just dont want to pay to mix coins cause Im only doing this once.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:48:43
Oh ok thanks. What if I use them to buy a novelty ID 
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:28:42
Thank you for the advice
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:28:28
I dont think I need mixing. Im just using bitcoin for a one time purchase
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:49:27
Whats a good personal wallet to use? And does transfering the bitcoin take time like it does to buy it? 
@_date: 2015-12-31 06:23:09
Thank you! Thats the answer I was looking for. Already created an electrum account. Now I just need to wait 7 days until I have the bitcoin in my coinbase account and then I'll transfer it into my wallet to buy a novelty ID :). 
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:47:19
Well I just bought 100$ worth of bitcoin today. Is there a way I can tranfer the bitcoin somewhere thats safer to use without it taking like a week?
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:16:29
I think this is one of the biggest reasons bitcoin will succeed anything. Simply because of the name. A lot more people know about bitcoin than any other crypto coin. It would have to take the entire active crypto community to turn against it in order for it to die.. so I feel. That and all the exchanges trade in BTC. Nothing else really. Or not really anything I've seen. Take my words with a grain of salt because I've only had skin in the game for about 4 months, but I'd love to know if anyone with more knowledge about all of this could tell me why my thinking is skewed!

Is palm beach a scam? I know people who are subscribed 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:28:44
I don’t! Why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:12:19
I’m trying to learn for sure

Yes you can invest in a good mutual fund with guaranteed returns of a certain percentage over a specific time period. Those can be like 30 year plans though

He was dreading the fact of the call cause he thought his dad would be mad. The call turned out better than expected. The call itself happened though

What is BTW coin? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:49:35
I love reading things like this. It reminds me of the current state of the dollar. Right now the dollar is being supported by thin air. The United States is getting pretty close to major financial collapse and I think a lot of people know it. When that happens it’s not going to matter what the current state of btc is. People *will* be looking for a savior and it will be the dominant and well established (known, heard of) bitcoin. At first.. We don’t know if anything will ever take over btc yet but right now it’s looking like store of value will be in btc and people will find another currency with cheaper tx fees for smaller purchases.. maybe litecoin? Or something of the sort, but you get the point. Btc will be the savior of those looking for an asset to put their money in. Btc will be king for this reason alone. No matter what the problems with it are. People don’t care about the details. They want simple and right now simple is btc. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:50:37
Someone will come along to simplify it.. think of coinbase. They’re already making great moves towards simplifying btc. Is it exactly what a big time trader and someone involved in crypto would prefer? Probably not but it’s at least a start. Things will get easier and everyone knows btc and that is what they will run to.

It would just be in satoshi.. how much do I owe? 3 satoshi! And then I give cashier 3 satoshi.. just like dollars and cents. I believe almost all purchases will only be in satoshi if we ever get the fees lower.
Prices on cars will be 30,000 satoshi and so on..
