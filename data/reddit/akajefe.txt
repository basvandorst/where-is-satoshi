Lets just think about this for a moment though. So instead of paying someone 1500 Euros a month for a pension, now they pay people ~6.8 BTC a moth. 1 Bitcoin is worth about 221 Euros currently. Great! Problem solved forever...but what if the conversion does not stay at 221 to 1. What if in 5 years it is 440 to 1, or 1000, or 5000? You *still* have to pay 6.8 BTC a month. I don't see this fixing anything at all.
The real underlying problem is making sure your expenses can be paid for. I don't know where people around here think Bitcoin can solve problems. Bitcoin is a tool just like any other. Throwing Bitcoin at Greece will no more fix their economy than would throwing a hammer at a pile of lumber build a house.
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:48:56
Which words did I use to make that statement? Did I actually say or mean that, or is more like *If you are not with us, you are against us* kind of thinking caused you to interpenetrate them a particular way?
Was it the part where I said deflating their money would be counter to their needs? Their needs being to fix the underlying problem. The underlying problem being not able to pay their obligations. That is what I am saying. Making their obligations cost more, potentially orders of magnitude greater, is counter to making sure they can pay them in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:34:35
But really, how is this helpful in any way for Greece in it's current situation? A currency that tends to run slightly deflationary in concept, and real potential for *massive* deflation (to the moon!) seems counter to their needs.
@_date: 2015-06-17 22:53:47
That is exactly what I am saying. Making sure you can pay for things *is* the problem and Bitcoin in no way solves it. The funny thing here is if they fix the problem, start paying long term expenses in Bitcoin, and the value of Bitcoin goes up, then they are going to start having problems paying for their expenses...

Yes. And as I have said now multiple times, in a variety of ways (which I am pretty sure you are not reading beyond the first sentence) that we *agree* on what the need is. They need to fix the problem. The problem is to make sure they can pay their way in the future. Making the money worth more over time MAKES THAT PROBLEM WORSE! 
You are creating a false dichotomy in that since I am against deflation, I must be pro inflation. Can't someone just want a stable currency?

Question. Does anyone feel uncomfortable with how much wealth transfer will be required for Bitcoin to become a major currency? At the current limit of 21 million coins, in order for the market cap to reach say, $5 trillion, then each coin would need to be worth about $240,000. Do you think early adopters should be rewarded so heavily?

The idea that people would "crawl over broken glass to save 5%"  is way off the mark. Humans are convenience orientated. People can and do pay *more* for something if its more convenient. How many people here use coupons? I mean actively seek them out to use them. I bet not very many. Do I think some people would convert to save 5%? Probably. Do I think an overwhelming majority of people would pay 5% more to not have to bother with a separate currency? Absolutely.
Until another option becomes more convenient than credit/debit, practically nobody will switch.

*Expedia, which is using Coinbase for bitcoin processing, won’t hold the digital currency it receives, but that’s not “a statement on bitcoin, pro or con,” Mr. Gulmann explained. Rather, Coinbase’s default setting is for a daily settlement back into U.S. dollars.*
I get people are excited, but is Expedia actually accepting Bitcoins or dollars in exchanges for their services? Coinbase is accepting Bitcoins from consumers. Expedia is accepting dollars from Coinbase.
Also, what is different about large retailers accepting payments from a large third party processor? Is this any different than current credit cards? Maybe you are in favor Coinbase simply because it is not a bank. What happens processors like these *dominate* the market and start acting like banks, or better yet, get taken over by actual banks?
I am not seeing any improvements here...

To be fair, NewEgg still does not accept bitcoins. They accept dollars from Bitpay, which is different. As far as I am aware, very few (if any at all) major online retailers accept bitcoins on a peer-to-peer basis. This is simply a more complex way of getting a third party processor involved with purchasing things.
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:24:24
Expense of set up? It is easy enough to train a human to accept a different method of payment, but how do you accept pier-to-pier payment if your system is completely automated and not configured to do so? You would have to overhaul or even replace your point of sales software. Or you would need additional staff to process them manually. That does not sound cheep. I suppose you could accept dollars from a third party vendor who does that for you (just like a credit card processor), but that is not taking Bitcoins as payment though.

I love how you cherry pick your your timeline as well to show what you want. I suppose you forgot that between March and April of this year (which is within your 6 month time frame), Bitcoin lost about 40% of its value. It lost 40% in approximately 1 month. How can you say that is not volatility? 
If you look at another 6 month period between October 2013 and March 2014, Bitcoin was up 1100% and then down 55%. This is not ancient history either.

Most are offering discounts way above the savings they would get on processing fees. If I was an online retailer, I would absolutely be enticing excited Bitcoiners looking to support business that accept Bitcoin.

I hear a lot about how Bitcoin would allow the people to fight back against the banks and governments. This seems counter intuitive to me. A completely anonymous currency seems like it would be the play thing of the mega-rich and corrupt. I could easily see it giving them more power an influence then they already have. Is there something I am missing?
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:02:09
*The only way it does affect the price is if people are spending their bitcoin and not replacing them because they believe the price is dropping anyway--again playing the trend in a way. I'd like to hear if people are doing this too.*
Thats it right there. Not even taking the new coins coming in every day into consideration, for Bitcoin value to remain the same then 100% of every purchase made with Bitcoins would have to be bought up again. Some people might not buy because they think the price will continue to go down. Some people might not buy because they don't have the funds. Other people might not buy because they will do it "later" and never get around to it.
That last one I think is critical for a couple of reasons. Humans are lazy. We all are lazy. Every single one of us. We have direct deposit and auto-pay because we are too lazy to cash our paychecks and pay our bills. Needing to buy back Bitcoins after each purchase, or once a week, or once a month only allows for less than 100% retention. Until Bitcoins become easier than credit/debit cards, then there is 0% chance for it to be adopted outside of a niche user base.
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:51:30
The first question is really the only question. All others hinge off of it. 
If you are happy with Bitcoin being a niche PayPal and Western Union alternative, then price is unimportant. If you want it simply as a store of wealth, then price stability is important. If you look for mass adoption and becoming a major world currency, then the price needs to go up drastically. 
Even people who live paycheck to paycheck do not often spend every dime the instant they get it. It gets somewhat spaced out over the course of the pay period. In order to pay 200 million people $1,500 every other week, then there needs to be $300 billion dollars in the system and everyone needs to spend every last cent of it by the end of the two weeks. 
If you want to be able to account for things like savings, stock markets, and governments/international corporations making multiple billion dollar transactions, then there needs to be *significantly* more value than even that.
If you want it to be a major world currency then the market cap of Bitcoin needs to be in the trillions of dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:04:54
Maybe I am putting words in the mouth of but perhaps he is saying if you take away the ability for merchants to securely and easily cash out (what bitpay and other third party processors do), they would drop Bitcoin faster than you could blink.
I think saying Expedia and NewEgg "accept" bitcoins is a bit too far. It's more that Expedia and NewEgg trust third party processors to pay them in dollars on demand. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:54:24
Then why with the title?
Our capacity to harm each other is directly in line with our ability to provide food and shelter to soldiers away from their homes and our advances in weapons technology. Wars used to often come to an end not because one side won, but they ran out of things to eat. It did not matter how much money you had, it was simply not possible to transport large quantities of food. They ate off the land and when the land was bare, they went home. Tyrants have been always been able to drum up enormous sums of money to fund their campaigns. With our industry and technology, soldiers no longer have to live off the land. Bitcoin would not change this. The "monstrous abominations of violence" have overwhelmingly been carried out within arm's reach. Today is little different. Bullets are cheap and blades are even cheaper. The Rape of Nanking did not require ungodly expensive equipment. We can kill each other in very inexpensive ways. Unless Bitcoin can somehow magically turn bullets into daises, gasoline into mud, and food into stones, I don't really see what you are talking about.
@_date: 2014-09-09 19:50:45
I suppose that depends entirely on how you classify "volatile." Comparing to what Bitcoin has done in the past. Yes, it is stable. If you were to compare it to any other major currency, it is extremely volatile. +/- 10% or more on a weekly basis is not a stable currency.
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:45:24

* It has 2 lines of symmetry
* It is shaped like a rectangle

@_date: 2014-12-17 18:50:18
I think people overestimate the "Power of the People" in Bitcoin. Wealth always has been accumulated very unevenly at the top. Bitcoin is no different. Good news for the consumer is good news in the smallest segment of the community in terms of net worth. It has little to no impact on the numbers of coins bought and sold. The value of Bitcoin is set by the people who buy and sell Bitcoin. Us peasants no more control the price of Bitcoin than we control the price of crude oil, copper, or dollars. 
Our habits can have the smallest influence, almost insignificant even, but the opposite direction has a massive effect. Our habits are significantly influenced by the people who control wealth in all shapes and forms.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:14:05
Okay then. So the context should read "The citizens of these countries need Bitcoin...because it is just as unstable as the currency they are already using."?

But that would most likely spoil the circle jerk though. Coins.ph probably works on a % fee where Western Union charges a flat fee. If you set your sample size to 1 and pick a low number, your service is going to look really good. 
Send $50 and save 50%. Send $100 and maybe it costs the same. Send more than $100 and it might actually be cheaper to go with Western Union. People have come to the assumption that remittance through Bitcoin is by default cheaper than any other means, but thats not necessarily true once you factor in the conversion to local currency.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:19:55
I disagree. It would be like saying they accept Rubles, but only after the Rubles are sent to a bank and converted into dollars. If you could somehow send Rubles directly to them through the internet, they would not take the payment for the same reason if you were to send them bitcoins. They don't accept either form of currency as payment. If you could do the same things with dollars as you could with bitcoins, every online retailer in the US would be setting up direct pay the very next day because they accept dollars.

This is all well and good if your only intention is to use Bitcoin as a medium to exchange other currencies. If you desire it to be a stand alone system, then that is a big problem. 
Lets say one day you go into the store an buy a gallon of milk for 1 bitcoin (very high quality milk!). The next day you see another store sells the same milk for .9 bitcoins. Which store has the best deal on milk? Not only do you need to calculate what the value of bitcoins were yesterday and today, but you might need to remember what time of day you bought the milk as well. At 1:00 yesterday bitcoins, were valued at $750. At 2:00 bitcoins were valued at $700. As you are looking at the milk today, bitcoins are valued at $810.

Despite what some people may think, the government is not looking at your bank statements and then deciding when you need to be taxed. 
Businesses record their transactions and then report their income to the state. Business record payments to their employees and report that to the state. If they want to avoid paying taxes, they need to misrepresent their income to the state. This has been done since the dawn of taxation. For Bitcoin to "End Nation States," *significantly* more business will need to do this and to a massive degree.

Sure you can, but someone needs to have access to it. If I was the head of the Central Bank of Mosul and someone had taken my family and wanted money, its hard for me to say I would be an absolute rock and not cave into their demands. All I would have to do is walk down to the safe with the keys like I do every day and give them the information. 
If it was fiat would I just put the $400 million in my pockets, walk out like nobody would notice, and leave it in an inconspicuous location? Would I write them a check for them to deposit? Would I give him the keys to the vault so he could make the withdrawal in person? How could you take that much fiat scot-free without a bigger force of arms in the region? 
It is possible with crypto though. You don't need to attack the physical safe itself to get the money, just the people who can open it.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:09:15
It does matter if you want Bitcoin to be more than a Paypal/Western Union alternative. If you want to pay 200 million people an equivalent value of $1500 in Bitcoin every 2 weeks, then there needs to be at minimum $300 billion in market cap. Every single person would need to spend every last bit at the end of the 2 weeks. If you want to allow each person to have $10,000 in personal savings, then there needs to be an additional $2 trillion in market cap.
If people want Bitcoin to function as a stand alone currency, one where people get paid in Bitcoin and never have to convert it, then there *needs* to be multiple trillions of dollars worth of it.

It *sounds* nice, but do they really? There are several nations today that use the same currency and their boarders are still intact. Boarders exist and have existed when precious metals, bolts of cloth, and livestock were the means of transferring wealth. Hell, borders exist in non-human animals who have no concept of exchanging of goods.

I think a better way to look at it is regulations reduces the instances of fraud. You are right, regulations can't *stop* people from doing these things. There is no way they can. Scams (especially the good ones) can be hard to detect and even harder to untangle once uncovered. What regulations do is make sloppy, careless, malicious, fraudulent record keeping a punishable offense in itself.
At best you could say mtgox *might* not have happened under the eye of regulators. Maybe it would. Who knows. One thing I am pretty sure of though is if there were regulations, Karpelès and Madoff would be BFFs right now.

TIL that fraud was not possible before the invention of ordering by mail.

Because it does not actually solve the problem it intends to solve. Not until they can pay rent, payroll, inventory, taxes, utilities, and so on with Bitcoin anyways. How do you convert largish quantities or Bitcoins to dollars without a bank account? It can be done. There are exchanges that don't require a bank account and will send you a check/money order by mail. Then you need to go to a financial institution and cash it. Now you are standing there with a pile of cash and need to transport it. Where exactly was the improvement?

There is a pretty significant difference between Tesla releasing ownership of their patents and making them public domain, and Tesla making their patents usable by the public. 
Tesla did not release ownership of the patents. Many patents do not represent actual things, just a theoretical way of doing something. There is some obstacle to making it a reality. This obstacle requires time and money to overcome.
Perhaps I am too cynical, but it seems Tesla is inviting people to work out the details of their patents for them. If someone makes a big breakthrough, guess who still owns the patent?

It depends on your point of view. Some nutjobs hold Bitcoin in such regard that this constitutes "pure evil" to them. Bitcoin will end greed, corruption, inequality, world hunger, and cause peace on earth if just given a chance to succeed. Anyone who potentially restricts it's free implementation might as well be throttling Baby Jesus.

Considering that there is no universally accepted definition of patent troll, claiming it is used improperly is non sequitur. 
You are talking about patent troll as a noun, where is using "patent trolling" as an adjective. In other words, Coinbase is doing the things a patent troll might do. I find that hard to argue against.

Could also put another spin on that.
"Banking is sinful." Who said it? Pope Leo the Great or r/bitcoin?

There lies the problem with appeal to authority. Arguments should be examined on their own merit. Not based on who said them. *However*, if you don't have the resources to do that, then what else  is there? Because it sounds right, or it agrees with something you already believe to be true, are just as wrong to do.

I get what you are saying, but it's interesting that sand as a whole is the most mined mineral in the world by value. More than gold, iron, copper, or granite. It's not expensive, but the world sure uses a lot of it and does not require as much post mining processing.

It reminds me about a comic I saw (and I can't find) about the people you see at a Bitcoin convention. The "Expert Analysis" booth was a guy with a price graph and a strait edge.

Swingline staplers are not fucking over developing nations either, but we are not making posters about that.
First things first. Something needs to be influential enough to *do* something before you can make prideful statements on how it is not doing anything.

This does not explain the behavior either, but once you accept that and hundreds of other troll subs exist, then is almost expected. People on the internet go out of their way to make fun for no reason.

You better get accustomed to it. Wealth always has been concentrated in the hands of a few. This allows them to increase/decrease the supply of coins to a large degree. They don't need to be granted the privilege by an authority to inflate/deflate the money supply. He who controls the money controls the markets. It is a completely free market which means people a free to coordinate their efforts for their collective best interest.

No more incentive than other businesses for a couple reasons. 
Even under fantastic circumstances the percentage of business that would be done in Bitcoin would be quite small and not actually solve the problem. 
The reality of business is they can not function on Bitcoin alone. They will need to convert it to fiat either through a service like BitPay, or selling them on an exchange. Correct me if I am wrong, but don't those also require a bank account to get fiat out? Wasn't the difficulty of finding a bank the entire premise of the problem to begin with? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:05:49
Yep. Bitcoin will also take all the effort and risk of detection from evading campaign finance laws.

The one aspect of money that I think you are either ignoring, or not putting enough emphasis on is being able to exchange it for goods and services. Maybe you can store it (although I think a business holding onto a lot of Bitcoin is extremely risky at this time), but it is hard to spend it. You can't pay most of your bills with it. Anyone who has run a business knows there is a *constant* stream of bills to be paid. 


This is exactly what I am talking about though. You are just paying fees and postage out the ear while not solving the problem. Lets say you got your money order and cashed it at the bank. Great! Now you are standing outside the bank with a mountain of cash. Tell me again, what was the *original* problem we were trying to solve?

These "dark markets" absolutely fail when convenient alternatives are available. Don't get me wrong that they don't exist in any form, but I would challenge anyone to say they thrive. You can go out and buy black market gasoline if you look, but why?
I am not even talking about products available on Pirate Bay. Even this part of your comment hints at what I am talking about. You said *Microsoft* products. There is no doubt to who owns the intellectual rights. Being available on Pirate Bay does not take a big chunk out of their pocket or threaten their rights to it. 
Lets say you did your thing and made some great software as no one, from nowhere in particular. I stumble across this software and think its pretty cool. What if I decide I am the one who made it? I own the rights to it. I get it patented in a particular place and go around selling it in retail stores. Microsoft notices this and offers to by the rights for $400 million. Where do you file your lawsuit? Who are you and in what way do you claim ownership of this product?
This already does happens, but you could argue people did not take the proper steps to protect their property just like people who get their coins stolen. With software, if you don't say who you are and what you own then you are practically inviting people to take your intellectual rights.

The difference is if every single credit credit card company were to fold up in the next 5 minutes, almost nobody would stop taking dollar or euros. If Bitpay, Coinbase, and every other third party Bitcoin processor were to fold up or stop paying fiat on demand, then that 100,000 merchants that accept Bitcoin would instantly drop to less than 1,000.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:29:44
Doesn't anyone think this would be less secure? This seems like it would be much more likely to be mixed up, misplaced, thrown out on accident, or taken because someone just wants a mint. Instead of mitigating risk it just takes another, possibly greater, form.

This might be fine on a purely developmental level of making software but it would be really bad for the business side of making software. Who is going buy your software? Perhaps some fringe individuals might, but no business would buy software from a company located nowhere in particular with nameless employees. I would have to trust you, someone who has no identity, to follow through on your promises and not screw me. Who could I turn to should you prove untrustworthy?
This also leads to who will protect you and your intellectual property? Technology as a whole can be like the Wild West already, but doing this would strip any resemblance of protection you have from people who could blatantly take your ideas, and there is nothing you could do about it.

It's a good thing we live here in Bitcoinland where this sort of thing simply can't happen.

A business that is doing well will be able to keep $2 out of ever $10 that it brings in. That is after paying employees, rent, utilities, taxes, permits, maintenance...everything. Obviously daily income and expenses won't always be even, but an overwhelming majority that comes in one day will be gone the next. Converting your dollars to coins one week, only to convert ~80% of it back the next seems impractical with the additional fees and lead time you would need without a bank. 
The whole Bitcoin for business without a bank account seems like a mess.
