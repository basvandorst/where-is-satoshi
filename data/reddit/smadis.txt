I was confused for about 3 seconds and was like "wait a minute, this is Bitcoin Core..." Then I burst out laughing. :D

Absolutely right. The scaling debate is happening precisely because bitcoin has been successful and reached a ceiling. This ceiling does not have to be permanent. To think that altcoins would never have similar issues is naive and if changes could be implemented easily then the currency would lack security and would not be decentralized. Bitcoin has the infrastructure and name recognition. It is a cryptocurrency that you can actually use in shops and restaurants or exchange for fiat at an ATM. If you already have a hard time convincing people to implement bitcoin in their businesses, what would happen if bitcoin was to crash and burn? It would not be good for any cryptocurrency and trust would be difficult to regain for years to come. This debacle has to end and people from both sides must reach a consensus.

How are we dumb? The 1300 dollar price tag was clearly a temporary  price hike caused by panic buyers and didn't reflect a sustainable value for that time. Bitcoin will exceed 1300 dollars again in the future and then it will be a natural increase in demand instead of pure speculation.

Can you find anything suitable? If so, find a reputable seller with good feedback and everything should be good. If you buy via an online transfer, the seller's BTC will be locked as escrow until he confirms that he received your money. I myself organize cash trades on Localbitcoins here in Estonia.

Yes, it's perfectly legal. You will be happy about your investment when you grow up and think about what a wise decision you made as a teenager. :)

I assume that the price would skyrocket as people start panic buying BTC. I would predict a short-term stabilization at around $1500 with a healthy future growth until we reach the next scaling ceiling. BU would probably suffer a huge blow because nobody would have a reason to support it for a long time.

Bitcoin is surprisingly resilient already considering its age. People trust it more now that they have seen its potential and ability to regain popularity. Therefore, crashes similar to the one after the Mt Gox incident are less likely to happen. Also, I am happy about the ETF decision. BTC is unregulated and that's a good thing!

Both are decent. Pick the cheapest one for you (including shipping fees). I have the Trezor because the overall cost with shipping was like $20 less than what Ledger offered.

I would definitely advise you to buy a hardware wallet for around $100 if you are buying $20k worth of btc. It is for your own safety. Never trust an exchange to hold that kind of amount for the long term. A hardware wallet gives you the convenience of an online wallet while allowing you to keep your keys offline and under your own control. I personally have a Trezor, no complaints.

If there is more buying pressure on the market than selling pressure, the price rises. If more people try to sell than buy, the price drops. As simple as that.

You are not fucked because your bitcoin address changed. All of your bitcoin addresses will still direct the money to your wallet (private key) even if they have already been used and they will continue to do so. Bitcoin wallets often change your addresses to increase your privacy but sending to an old address should still work. What service are you using? Maybe the transaction just hasn't confirmed yet? Send us the transaction id or the public address you sent the money to.

Another way of calculating this in 2 steps:
1 BTC/0.00498859(your amount)= 200.457
100/200.457= 49.9 cents

If you buy it on Coinbase, you can just sell it back to Coinbase via the buy/sell button. Technically you could hold your bitcoin on Coinbase for the long term but I would advise against it because you are trusting a third party with your money. You can use bitcoin wallet software on your PC or phone or even better, a hardware wallet to generate your own wallet and then use the "Send" button on Coinbase to transfer it and take control of your own bitcoin. And yes, it does not matter if you have less than a bitcoin. BTC can be divided into 100 million units so you can even transfer tiny fractions of it.

These links might be able to help you:
The situation described there is exactly the opposite but the solution should be similar. Just replace Litecoin with Bitcoin and vice versa. You must have access to the private key or seed of the target address though. Otherwise your only hope is to contact customer support (if it's an online wallet) and ask them to help you. I hope this helps.

There is a third option though. Both sides could remain in a deadlock for years without any consensus because of Bitmain's and Roger Ver's stupidity which will allow other cryptocurrencies to surpass Bitcoin. But sadly that will be a win for Roger as well due to his investments in altcoins.

"Looks stupid" is not a convincing argument, Jihan Wu. Anything that removes your $100 million yearly ASIC boost profits will look stupid in your eyes. You do not own Bitcoin though, the people do.

No way, one year is much too long. We do not have a lot of time left, bitcoin is losing dominance and other cryptos are already planning to take over. This situation will get even more extreme when more and more people hear about bitcoin. Transactions could cost dozens if not hundreds of dollars as people try to panic sell their coins. We need a solution and we need it fast, no more delays are possible. Rootstock might just be part of the solution.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:33:55
The thing is that you don't yet know whether we reached the peak or not. We could very well be in the bear trap that is visible before every peak. That would require you to significantly adjust the graphic.

Transactions cost less than 20 cents 2 months ago, they are now ten times higher. Now imagine what they would be like in a year without any scaling improvements. The compromise SegWit2x (FrankenSegWit) that is currently being developed will hopefully be deployed this summer. This is probably the safest solution if we put aside our differences like adults and agree to work with Jihan, depsite our different views. The code will be open source and we will be able to vigorously test it throughout the summer to see how well it works.

I know that we need bigger blocks, I have never had a problem with increasing the block size by a reasonable amount so that regular users could still run nodes. The thing is that we already have a thoroughly tested code for a good scaling improvement (SegWit). Why not implement it first and then think about a HF for a block size increase? BU's code cannot be trusted as it is, their own testnet running it has crashed several times already and the code still has vulnerabilities. This cannot happen to actual Bitcoin, we have almost $40 billion at stake here.

Already done :)

No, the combined value would be far less than what it is now. This is why we cannot have a chain split, it would destroy the fundamentals and pros of bitcoin as a store of value with a limited amount of coins available. Public image would also be ruined as people would not trust bitcoin anymore due to there being many different versions of it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:36:02
The difference is that this happened during Ethereum's infancy. Hell, very few people know what Ethereum is even today. How will you explain to the millions of people holding bitcoin that now they have twice the amount of bitcoin and that there are now 2 different bitcoins? Panic would ensue and this would be the perfect opportunity for another crypto to take over. I do not want this to happen. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:22:36


Don't buy it in $50 increments. The amount of money you would spend on transaction fees is ridiculous. The average cost of a transaction is around 3 dollars right now. It is much better to pile your money up and buy it in bigger increments every now and then instead.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:58:27
Yeah, I was talking about this year's graphic.

True, I hope that problem gets solved soon.
