If the big UK banks were willing to let us open a transactional bank account, we would love to offer GBP Faster Payments to our customers. :)

We'd prefer that you send an email to support+reddit with your reddit username and it will get prioritized.
Think of it as an member perk. :)

If you could send an email to support+reddit and include your reddit username, we'll be happy to track down your case. 
Applies to anyone on the thread that might be running into similar issues.

Not really. It's no different than a company offering loyalty programs with special customer support phone numbers for their best customers. :)
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:27:28
Best to use the support email (with the reddit tag) instead of PM'ing employees directly.

Can you send an email with your reddit username to support+reddit
Someone will look at your ticket ASAP. :)
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:33:11
Feel free to do this — will only be useful if there's an associated reddit username though. :)
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:38:36
We are doing our best to support all of our customers.
support+reddit is just another way for customers that also participate on to escalate their requests. We've found that many of the support issues from customers that are also reddit users tend to be particularly challenging/unique.

If you are open to it, curious how we could be better serving your needs with higher limits. If you visit  — does the apply for higher limits process not work for you?
Feel free to send an email to support+reddit and include your reddit username, we'll be happy to take another look at your limits.

Frusturating to hear that we haven't been able to make your debit card work with Coinbase.
If you want, please send an email to support+reddit and include your reddit username, we'll be happy to investigate.

Coinbase (and GDAX) stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in segregated, custodial bank accounts. The funds held in those accounts belong to Coinbase's customers - not to Coinbase. All USD customer funds are held in US banks which are members of FDIC. 
Even if Coinbase were to become insolvent, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase's customers.

Sounds like you've made up your mind—so less trying to convince you otherwise, but rather wanted to share the reality of being a bitcoin exchange/conversion service in the US:
* Since [March 2013]( FinCEN—the primary anti-money laundering regulator in the US—has required businesses like Coinbase to have a [BSA/AML program](
* As part of that, we're required to ask about a [customer's sources of funds/wealth/employment](
* If we don't do that (i.e. "Coinbase should push back!"), we run the risk of [fines]( losing our licenses and/or ability to move/store fiat currency and potential criminal liability.
So when we ask for information, it's not rooted in any inherent desire to invade customer privacy. It's legally required. And by fulfilling those requirements we are able to operate our business—which ultimately allows more people to obtain bitcoin and grow the whole ecosystem.

As mentioned previously, even in the case of an account closure, you should still be able to withdraw your funds. You can read more about it here: 
Secondly, we are unable to look into this case specifically unless you email your reddit username to support+reddit

Sorry to hear that we couldn't make Coinbase work for you.
To reiterate: we no longer offer instant ACH purchases. We've migrated instant purchases to debit and credit cards. However, bank purchases (via ACH in the US, SEPA in EU, etc.) are still available, albeit they will take a couple days to settle.

We have been notifying known users of Toshi.io for the past year that it is unmaintained. We have no current plans to improve the hosted service. It is likely that we will completely sunset Toshi.io in the next 6 months, although we will continue to offer the open source code on Github.

This goes to our own support system. support+reddit allows customers that choose to post on reddit the ability to connect their reddit post with their already active support case.

You should be able to purchase bitcoin with a debit card without having to link a bank account.

Sounds like a frustrating experience. Not that this will change your mind, but wanted to share detail on a couple of items mentioned.
Earlier this year, we removed the ability to instantly purchase via ACH and replaced it with instant purchases through debit and credit cards. (ACH payments were never instant, we just assumed the risk.) It's something we may offer again in the future, but no current plans.
As for fees, an overview of how we calculate our fees is available [here](

I'm curious to learn what bank is blocking transactions via ACH to Coinbase. We've been able to resolve these types of issues in the past.

Clarification: pre-fork (old) vs. post-fork (new) ETC

Some additional clarification:
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:32:35
"with ETH balances at the time of the hard fork"
Coinbase/GDAX is not supporting or storing any incoming ETC (i.e. post fork)
@_date: 2016-07-27 05:31:11
GDAX will allow for withdrawals for ETC:
