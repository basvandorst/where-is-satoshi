Yeah but the lag on your miners would be 2 million times greater too and all your work units would be invalid by the time they make it back to earth. Unless you could setup a binary relay or FTL drive.

Amazon can't do customer service for an order that originated from you and that you shipped. They simply forward the customer's issue to you.
Also they take 15%.

Pay the 2 bucks extra for signature confirmation, which will legally stand in court. Use it on your high value items. USPS will scan as delivered but can still deliver it to the wrong address. If you have signature confirmation amazon sides with you and you win.

Ofcourse it will, those guys took big positions in it. You don't buy 100,000 coins and then media frenzy that its going to tank. Its just the whales doing their plays, move along now and make your own decisions.

I currently sell about 100+ used books and textbooks daily on amazon, and would love to accept BTC for them. Keep me posted.

Set your buys for the dips, there is a panic dump each night. There will likely be some correction but knowing bitcoin the rally is gonna go to the moon first. When it starts feeling stupid set some stop loss orders on the way down so you are out to the first who dump

I sell video cards for a living and have had a huge amount of orders go to Venezuela, even at rediculous prices like $500 for a Radeon 580 ($230 retail). This summer every capable crypto mining video card sold out and thats what used ones went for... I figured as much that the $2-3 of bitcoin a card like that mines per day would be more than a week of work for a regular person especially with the run away inflation.  Its trivial in the U.S. especially after the cost of equipment and electricity but for Venezuela I realized its the difference between being okay and starving because you would lose what money you had anyway due to the inflation, so people were chosing to lose it in equipment that at least earns them bitcoin which has been gaining in value and gives you full control like you said.
This has been going on for 2 years actually and I wish someone would break a news article out on it, its very interesting. The smarter ones use freight forwarders to consolidate their orders at a US address and send it all at once internationally, since many US based sellers like myself do not accept international orders due to the difficulty of proving delivery and a high rate of scams.

I've already been hearing this for months, on the other exchange there is daily spam of "mtgox is going to support [x] spam coin" to get the newbs to buy. I don't think it should happen. These alternate coins offer nothing new other than "faster" confirmations which really only benefit traders. If you add LTC, and then XYZ coin to gox where is the line? It will turn into cryptsy and it will only confuse mass appeal away from adopting btc if people constantly have to stress about how it trades against other coins. If you want an exchange for every coin just use cryptsy it already exists and it blows hard.
