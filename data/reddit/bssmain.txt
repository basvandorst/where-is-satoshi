No problem mate. Hope it's the first of many.

Definitely sold me on getting one of these for my mate and probably one for myself. You can load it after you get the card right? You don't need to get bit-card to do it.

Have to agree there. Started using them a few weeks ago. They support online deposits with netbank(commonwealth bank). Fairly fast service after my initial transaction

 Doubt anyone here is going to buy BTC over paypal ... too many threads about people getting burned from doing that... not saying your not trustworthy

As someone who just started using coinjar recently i gotta say that this is a huge bummer. I loved just doing a netbank transfer and getting it in coinjar in 5 mins. Sad to see it go. Might have to open a NAB account if you guys are planning on making the NAB transfers less than an hour...if thats possible(i dont know if there are any limitations stoping you.)

O sorry yer that is what i meant. For steam games  is available so maybe check them out. Haven't used them though so i can't say for sure. Also humble bundle supports bitcoin now so thats another way to get a few cheap games for bitcoin.

Very excited about this week. I'm a relatively new bitcoin user and I've been stuck at uni on Wednesdays so this will be my first.

Been thinking about getting one later on as a Christmas present for a mate who has been thinking about getting into bitcoin. Just curious did it get delivered by AusPost or a courier like DHL or something?
@_date: 2013-08-21 02:00:19
Yeah but i was skimming through the comments and they seem mostly about either SR or how bitcoin is a fake currency or ponzi scheme. Don't get me wrong i understand that it's not but seems like it's getting a bad wrap over on the video. Maybe some redditors more knowledgeable than me can go over there an quench the flames.

You have peaked my interest. PM me.
@_date: 2013-08-15 09:28:46
Good to know. Also wanna add that you guys are the best Australian exchange I've used. Keep it up!

I may be wrong but I think he is talking about little to no physical stores accepting Litecoins not Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-17 02:54:04
Use another client if you don't want the block chain . Multibit maybe? That or get a online wallet on blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:45:49
Save as above for you sir.
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:22:48
His got a stick up his ass's ass? On a side note nice to see something other than SR news.
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:35:43
Oh it give you a message to confirm. I can see the others in block chain though so its all good
@_date: 2013-08-01 03:49:22
 try there maybe? Someone might have it up on there.
@_date: 2013-05-08 10:23:31
didn't have enough in my reddit tip wallet (didn't know it had transaction fees as well not included in tip). Here i think you deserve a tip.Also no idea why people put verify since the imgur guide doesn't have anything on it.

Too bad there are so many people that don't understand bitcoin in the comments and yell about it being a 'fake' digital currency or a ponzi scheme. Does give bitcoin a slight boost in public awareness in a more positive way though i think.

Memory *is* RAM. Sorry couldn't help myself that just reminded me of The IT Crowd.

I'm actually more surprised that it wasn't already blocked in China especially with the Great Firewall of China and the government over there.
@_date: 2013-10-17 02:58:09
Should be in appdata&gt;bitcoin if your on windows. I have no idea about on Linux or osx
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:45:24
Thanks. It seems kind of obvious after you explain it like that. +1. If you can also tell me how to set up bit tip i would tip you. As i said I'm relatively new to bitcoin and even more so to this subreddit and clark moody.
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:39:29
Done. Good luck with school.
