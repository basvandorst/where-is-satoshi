Pretty sure services like this exist already =D

I'm not currently offering any software for download. When the time comes for release, the app will be published in the Mac App store and will ONLY be available from the official download link from Apple. If you can't trust Apple's review processes to catch any embedded Malware, simply don't download it =D. Obviously your concern is valid, and users should be extremely careful when downloading any application, especially those Bitcoin related.

I can do this for you. I well well versed in multiple programming languages and am the lead developer/owner of TebroTech. Our first app 'Bit Patrol' was recently released on the Mac App store that has similar functions to your utility. PM me if you would like to discuss further =D
Edit: I'll send you a message as well (didn't read the full post lol)

It may be a ticker at its core, but it has a few sick features up its sleeve. Don't want to give out any more information until things are finalized, but it should impress.

As long as there is no wallet features, it adheres to all of their development guidelines. I see no reason why it would not get approved. Additionally, there are other related Bitcoin apps on the Mac App store already, some published recently too.

Although I like your initiative, I don't see how a specialized app will help to further adoption. You can already donate to political causes using existing wallets

There's an app for that!
.... Of course I'll endorse my own product =D

I appreciate your offer, but Beta testing is currently being carried out by some of my fellow colleagues. I'm sure your intentions are sincere, but hope you can understand why I can't just send out unsigned, precompiled apps before everything is finalized with Apple.

That's odd. It's Apple iTunes...

I like this idea a lot. Although it would be a huge undertaking for a single dev
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:30:41
I can not release software that is has yet to be published under my developer ID and company copyright for fear of piracy. As soon as I have cleared Apple's review process, it will be free to download for all! Hoping the Bitcoin community will support me on product launch, as I've put ~100 hours into dev already. Not going to lie, I'd be a bit disappointed if this fell on deaf ears.

Best answer so far =D.
