Well Mt Gox seems to be in total flux whereas before the power was entirely with the bidders. the bitcoinity trackers are pretty insane right now.
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:47:02
Again, no.
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:13:29
Mt Gox still has his money. It's just not worth very much any more.

If Mexico's on board it's GOTTA be legit!
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:52:53
And still people trusted him with their assets.
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:18:32
So you're saying this is a good time to buy bitcoin on mt gox?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:09:49
Of course Chris Lamprecht is into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:20:21
no shit

IAMA Vatican City, tip me anything.

This is how the government will slowly move to taxing in btc.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:08:13
Thank you :)

I don't think it will grow quickly again. The massive rise put a spotlight on bitcoin and then it dropped sharply very suddenly. A lot of people will have backed off as a result of that.
The again, I could be completely wrong. Bitcoin is massively unpredictable.

Can't wait to see him go to prison for tax evasion.
"But your honor, my tax burden at time of payment was $1,736 per month!"  
"And at the time your tax return was filed that portion of your bitcoin was worth $12,729 per month. That's evasion."
etc. etc.

If Obama turns is back on bitcoin and labels the Chinese as currency manipulators (something Romney said he was going to do; the currency manipulator part, not the bitcoin part) I'm gonna lose it.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:01:48
Noob here. So when will the last bitcoin be mined?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:13:13
Thank you. Hopefully things will work out for all of us.
@_date: 2013-06-09 10:22:12
My bad. I think that was 59p.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:42:12
Professional bitcoin financiers. Is there anything more ironic?
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:37:09
Is it really $59 right now? I've got 0.01 btc and it's worth $0.59 in blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:58:59
Bitcoin skeptic here.
No offence, but you sound like a nutjob libertarian. I could easily rebut your comments by saying that your comments show little appreciation for social contracts and public funds. We can shriek and say the government is controlling the economy to suit themselves and their rich friends, but ultimately the stability offered to an economy by government initiatives can't be replaced by a truly free market. Free markets eventually break. Source: every free market ever.
Bitcoin will eventually be regulated and controlled. Any currency used by people will need to be.

"I'll trade you my strings of code for your planet."
Seems sensible.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:59:03
Pretty sure that could pass as bribery. Good work. "Here's money to express put interests in a Senate hearing."
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:33:21
Pffft. Snowden has this locked up.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:03:05
About 10 months ago someone in this subreddit gifted me 0.01 btc. I still have no idea how to move this into a wallet, if it hasn't been fished out of the cyber sea by someone else. If it's gone it's not the end of the world, but it would be nice to have it locked down, as I am considering investing £100 GBP/month into btc as a small investment project over the next year.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:10:06
So where it says ThisIsYourWithdrawBitcoinAddress that is where I enter my wallet number, correct?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:34:49
I hope you like being indiscriminately hated. Take a walk over to sometime. You'll see what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:47:06
Yeah but some of those middlemen secure and insure my money against theft and fraud, surely.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:29:26
I love bitcoin. Me. Here. I love bitcoin. My body is ready. Bitcoin. I love bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:11:03
Ok. Cheers.

56 hours ago they reached $900. Now they are going for $570. That's a crash by anyone's standards, even if it bounces back.
Edit: 36 hours ago, even.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:15:15
Man. You've already got more than me.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:46:35
It's chilling because the overall attitude many people are showing in this thread is that speculating on the monetary worth of certain strings of code is a stupid thing to do. Despite the fact that that is exactly how bitcoin rose to it's current value.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:10:44
Oh. Thank you :) That's very kind of you indeed.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:18:05
I thought the whole point of bitcoin was that it would mean the end of having other people manage your money. Doesn't it defeat the point having a money man if the phrase everyone likes to bandy about is Be Your Own Bank?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:58:28
Holding onto my 0.001btc. Come on, little guy!
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:43:09
Coming soon: a US government approved virtual currency.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:16:02
Thank you.
