You've never used PayPal, or never got a credit? Either you're very satisfied with your online purchases or you're reliant on paper statements. Credits literally take a fraction of a second to be issued.
At the very least, credit card processors won't allow a credit to be issued to a card that the consumer no longer has access to -- something you can't say about Bitcoin. If you had erased the key to the old address (remember, Satoshi says you aren't supposed to reuse addresses), you money would be lost forever, and Expedia would be saying "Sorry For Your Loss".

* Coinbase is licensed in all 50 states. Coinbase has lost no money.
* Mt. Gox was unlicensed. Mt. Gox lost lots of money.
It seems regulations are working.^1

Ah, so we should just let people lose money because a merchant wasn't careful with their machines?

Is Mt. Gox a trigger word for you or something?
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:03:54
Nonsense. With side networks and lightning chains, Bitcoin will become the new global currency.
@_date: 2015-06-07 11:34:44


Is that before or after sidechains and lightning networks are invented?

The problem with car maintenance records is not that they're inaccurate -- it's that they are frequently not reported. If a person in a rural area pays cash for some repair done by their local grease monkey, that work isn't being recorded in any database, blockchain or central. Also, people who change their own oil won't be willing to deal with any database, either.

Name one life that was saved.
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:30:41
Yes. It doesn't matter *who* you asked to kill someone, it merely matters that you asked to have someone killed.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:17:05


Yes, we all remember the time when Rosa Parks put a hit out on the bus driver, or when Harriet Tubman bribed John Wilkes Booth with Confederate money...

Funny how you write that in English and not in Japanese. Afraid of angering the wrong government, Roger?
(Go ahead and downvote me for disagreeing with the great Roger Ver. Guess what? Roger Ver lives in Japan, where the possession of a *gram* of marijuana can get you sent to prison. He won't protest Japan because they give him a nice place to convince people to give money to failing Japanese businesses.)

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:44:17
That's the difference between Ross and the others listed. Ross thought he was a living god, and he refused to plea guilty for a reduced sentence.

@_date: 2015-05-30 00:02:34
None. This is utter nonsense.
@_date: 2015-05-18 00:04:54
It doesn't.
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:48:26
Funny how literally none of those things exist.

It isn't "character assassination" if it's true.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:37:15
Does the allegation that an FBI agent is corrupt negate the allegation that Ross ordered a hit?
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:14:17
I would post a link, but it's a link to bitcointalk.org. Evidently, $1.5 million isn't enough to keep that site up and running.

The Internet **did** exist in the 1990s, and it was used by more people than BitCoin today.

1. It mentions Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-18 04:01:53
It would have to be an absurdly small and sparsely populated country to be able to use bitCoin for all monetary transactions.

Call me a skeptic if you'd like, but from what I understand, the way this wildly overpriced Raspberry Pi works is as follows:
 1. Plug it in. It connects to 21's mining pool, and *only* 21's mining pool.
 2. Your device gets to do the work that 21 Inc. would normally do, except that you pay for the electricity.
 3. You get a fraction of a penny every day as a reward, if 21's mining pool remains up and decides to pay you at all.
 4. Excess heat is generated by the [enormous fan]( on the board and the poor, poor, overworked Raspberry Pi processor. (You will, at most, have 1 GB of RAM on the device, which will easily be taken up by Bitcoin Core if that's the software it's running.)
