"Backed" refers to what supports the price. There are many factors, and military force is one of them when it comes to USD.       
See every comment here for some more explanations:   
     
I could find better sources than Quora but it was the top result when I googled and it's a fairly widely accepted premise, I don't want to spend too much time on it     
The physical definition on a surface level is as you say, 'what is it physically redeemable for'. But there are deeper reasons too.

They were more than just individuals though hey, they represented entire sovereign states and economies. That is the sort of force backing the US economy and subsequently the USD which one can say is effectively backing the USD directly
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:52:55
I actually find this really interesting.   
Is this the start of the **decentralized militarization of a cryptocurrency**? The US dollar is backed by the might of the US military, is Bitcoin now to be backed by the bounties and bounty hunters willing to act in protection of its market cap?
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:39:57


I'm not suggesting they will simply kill individuals for not using it. I am saying that the value of the US dollar is heavily resting on the might of the worlds strongest military force, and the ability, and willingness, to use it to protect US business interests.    
Going back to the OP, I am drawing parrallels between this and a decentralized terror group, or military, who are willing to use violence or force to support the interests of a currency which they are personally shareholders in. Think reddit trolls, but not bound by the borders of reddit.com, or indeed the internet. We have already seen this with cyber attacks (hacking) by people acting in the name of their chosen currency. You might not call that "backing", if you prefer, replace "backing" with "supporting the price"

So now you're saying that everyone is plotting together?    
They are, mostly, saying that because they believe that it is closer in design to the original Bitcoin as per whitepaper. The fight for the name is part of the game. It doesnt make it a scam

The best way I heard it put, is that Bitcoin has the potential to make Wall Street cannibalise itself as they rush to invest in the very thing which they know can bring about their demise

It's simply a way to invest in Bitcoin without owning the keys. There's not much difference betweeen a BTC ETF and people who buy to just "HODL". People who want to *use* bitcoin won't buy ETFs instead and suddenly find themselves surprised when they cannot take advantage of the decentralised ledger that backs their paper certificates
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:03:24
it's not much different to a gold ETF. It's why people will say if you are investing in Gold to hedge against a doomsday scenario, you need to buy physical gold and not derivatives.

It was always a maybe, as there is no reason to decline or we would have heard it with Winklevoss ETF, so they are simply giving the applicant time to comply.

I didnt downvote you, and I wouldnt just for disagreeing with me. I like it when people disagree. Its how the truth is continually refined.   
Going back to "being backed", the dollar was backed by silver now yes. Dollar is a legal definition, sure.    


How do you have enforced redemption without force? The means of that force is very much the thing backing the currency. This is like saying "houses dont rest on the ground, they rest on foundations. Ask any builder"       
   
  
If the US military did not act as a deterrant, punishment, and incentive against not using the USD as world currency and dropping the petro-dollar then it's value would be far, far less. This is what I mean when I say "backed"

@_date: 2018-05-03 22:15:09
if BCH is a shitcoin because some people did some bad stuff, Bitcoin is a shitcoin too. You may not like Ver, or BCH, but to call it a scam is a real stretch of the word
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:18:38
Which would be a valid marketing pitch. Doesnt make your little peniscoin a scam. Scam is about intent.
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:45:58
So in theory, I could turn every single coin into a scam if I wanted, just by saying that? Rogers being highly unethical in presenting BCH as "Bitcoin" on his websites, that crosses a line I agree. But saying it is closer to the original Bitcoin Blockchain is a claim he is entitled to make, saying BTC forked away is also a claim he can fairly make, "scales better and is accepted everywhere" are just debatable points, him saying those don't automatically turn it into a scam.         
The potential scam is one individual, RVer, tricking people into buying a coin he owns to boost the value of his holdings. The coin itself though, is just a version of Bitcoin with no blocksize limit. It is not a scam.
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:53:58
"It" does not speak to tell people what it is. It is not by design a scam, you just believe some people are scamming by misrepresenting it as BTC to confuse people. I take issue with that too, but that does not make BCH a scam. It's an important differentation.   
 
 Saying BCC is closer to the original Bitcoin is a fair rebuttal to BCHs "original Bitcoin" claims. Use that instead. Calling BCH a scam is laughable and just alienates people who don't buy into the mud-flinging shitshow
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:47:01

@_date: 2018-05-05 11:10:54
Well you are the one that said its a scam because one person was saying it "is the original bitcoin". Your posts are just moving the goalposts and you seem confused how open source tech and development works. You are now using examples comparing it to protected trademarks, which shows your lack of understanding.    
Ver has every right to say BCH is closer to the original vision than BTC, and that it makes it the real Bitcoin whilst BTC is usurped by banks and corporations. It may not be true, there are rebuttals against that, but claiming it does not make it a scam as you say. BCH is not being marketed. You say things like this: "Since it's name, it was misleading". Is linux Ubuntu/Mint/Fedora/ take your pick the scam OS then? Don;t move the goalposts by saying its something else that makes BCH a scam and not that. You specifically mention that, so explore that point logically.    
Or is it this, your concluding statement   


You know what Litecoin is, right? BCH is following a different path to BTC and they are very vocal about that. It is not just a copy and paste with a different name as you say. Don't fall for the bullshit being thrown around by either side of these debates. There are lowest common denominator types on both sides which will use the basest accusations and slanders to try and prove their points.   
   
If you ask me, R.Ver is someone who will bend rules to help what he sees as the real BTC succeed. He is not a scammer, but sometimes his actions cross lines and innocent people get put at risk (being mislead by his name change on bitcoin.com for example). He is not without fault. I also think the Theymos/Blockstream monarchy needs to be brought down, and that off-chain scaling is going to play an important part of Bitcoins future, whether BCH or BTC.    
Form your own opinions, don't just swallow the crap being thrown around

Charlie is pretty socially awkward, and seems to always say something to make situations worse on twitter.
Ver is an experienced marketer who knows how to push buttons and sell ideas to people, or audiences. He has plenty of experience in making fairly convincing arguments for his points, and is used to running rings around people who can more easily get stuck for the words needed to make counter-arguments to his points.   
Look at how Jimmy Song, Samson Mow, "That BTC supporter" faired against him. They get lost for words, frustrated, and either flip out or abandon the interview altogether.   
This debate was a socially awkward professional foot-in-mouther running rings around someone who normally dominates these sorts of debates, at least in the eyes of the viewer.

How much monopoly money would you want in exchange for your 1 bitcoin?

So to you, one Bitcoin is worth 500 truckloads of paper USDT monopoly money.   
USDT is not USD.
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:31:48
"The value of all tether is evaporated"  
This isnt really how it works. The value of Tether will evaporate, and the market cap of Tether will be gone. That doesnt mean anything else has to go down in value.   
The decrease in value will happen as there is less utility in Bitcoin (namely ability to trade it on USDT exchanges), uncertainty in the space, and Tether selling any assets the have to exit scam, which is likely the main driver in this scenario now that most exchanges have stable atlernatives to USDT and uncertainty should be fairly low, at least relative to where it would have been 1 year before, when USDT was basically the lifeblood of all crypto exchanges.   
I believe Tether have sold much of their BTC assets already, and they would not be selling off in the midst of the acual downfall of USDT. They may hold a bunch of BTC which they will stash away in various places, in anticipation of law enforcement seeking to confiscate it.   
Much of it has been laundered into EOS and other projects already.

@_date: 2018-06-16 11:12:28
You do realise Tether do not mention controlling the price through printing/destruction in their whitepaper, in their faq, on their website, in fact anywhere ever?   
You also realise that it is not even defacto pegged, and that the price has floated freely from $1.08 to $0.9 over time?       
   
If Tether sold USDT for $1, and promised to redeem it for $1 also, and people had faith in that promise, why would the price not float around the $1 mark as we have seen historically?    
Basically, your theory has no grounds in reality, Tether do not claim to do such a thing. They do not need to do such a thing. Noone credible from an exchange or Tether has ever said they do such a thing. There is literally no reason to believe they do such a thing.    
I'd be happy for you to prove me wrong, but I know in this case that I'm not. Besides, if Tether were printing more and destroying it to keep the price around $, that would mean they are not receiving payments for those USDT, and therefore they are not backed. So you have argued yourself into a corner.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:27:45

Isnt backed by fiat? I think you'll find that's what everyone *is* saying. That Tether are not receiving deposits for the USDT they print, it is not backed
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:46:37


I don't totally disagree with you. Part of their reasoning for saying that their findings are significant is that they don't see the opposite thing happening when Bitcoins price goes the other way. ie There is a lack of people sending USDT back to Tether to receive fiat. I don't think anyone wants to bother with that when its so much easier to sell BTC for fiat elsewhere
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:42:50


Well I don't see them depositing USD into Tethers bank accounts so we don't not see a problem

1 lawyer stating an opinion is not necessarily fact. I am not disagreeing with what he says, just saying
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:59:32
I know exactly what you are saying. You are saying that when demand is high on the exchanges, that Tether print moer to keep the peg around $1. I am saying they do not need to do that, the market is self-correcting, the availability of USDT for a set price and ability to redeem it for that set price means the market will naturally seek to correct to $1. Yes, more USDT enters the market if demand is high, but that is not by Tethers intervention. It is by market customers demanding USDT from Tether and selling it on exchanges (assuming non-fraudulent activity). You do not seem to be able to comprehend what I am saying and keep going back to finite supply vs infinite supply and other nonsense which my argument does not preclude.    
The supply is increased by market demand, not by Tether seeing demand and injecting Tether. Push vs pull.     
    


  
There is. It is called offering a fixed exchange rate, which they do. Entire countries currency pegs can operate

@_date: 2018-06-16 14:15:22
you are right but the question I am trying to settle is:  
   
Is the peg maintained by Tethers promise of buying back the USDT?     
Or do they just control it by printing more and burning some

Generally, over time the interest of whales should be fairly correlated to the interest of typical buyers. There isnt a certain wealth threshold over which they flip their buying habits and buy when everyone else is selling, or sell when everyone else is buying. Rich people are just people with more money after all.   
   
Regarding this study, it's far from conclusive evidence of anything in my opinion yes. However, it does show that there is a strong reason to be suspicious of the patterns of Tether printing with regards to the price, as it appears manipulative, unnatural, indicative of a certain strategy.    
I agree there is no proof of anything in it though, and it's far less important whether Tether or Tether users are manipulating BTC price than it is if Tether is printing at whim with nothing backing it. There's still room for this study though imo, patterns in Tether printing is fair game for such a study. Whether the study is a smear piece or not is also worth considering too though of course   
Basically, imo the study has relevance even if it is an attack piece, and even if it has limited scope. I'm not placing much weight on the conclusion, I doubt others will either. It may feel like I'm rambling but I'm trying to stake my position carefully sorry

@_date: 2018-06-14 04:43:59


   
The study concludes that Tether is statistcially more typically used to purchase Bitcoin when the price is dropping. This is actually significant as if Tether was just a typical onramp then we should see its use to buy Bitcoin increase whenever Bitcoins price is increasing. Instead, it is seemingly being used only to prop-up falling prices.    
Now, the study could well be a smear attempt, I agree. But, Tether is an easy target as they are dodgy as hell, and the results of this study are most likely valid

The study has relevance to all asset types, it supports findings on other asset classes too.    
    


mechanical  but  dynamic,  meaning  that  it  cannot  be  described  exclusively  by  the
revealed  supply  or  demand  at  any  given  time  –  say  the  content  of  the  visible  limit
order book [Weber and Rosenow, 2005].  It is rather related to underlying “latent”
supply and demand [Donier et al., 2015, T ́oth et al., 2011] which correspond to the
intentions  of  market  participants,  and  which  manifest  themselves  over  time.   Most
of the recent studies of impact have been carried out on transparent, listed markets.
Nevertheless,  many aspects of price impact appear to be universal,  i.e.  common to
many asset classes, even to exotic ones     
 
.  
  


They are not that different at all really. OTC sellers look for best price buyer bids, and vice-versa, and it occurs away from transparent order books. But I thought you were saying that off-exchange orders in general do not affect market prices? It seems strange to try and distinguish between OTC and auction sales, there is little practical difference.

1. stock buyback is different to owning a trading platform and using profits from the trading platform to manipulate the price of your other companies stock on said platform    
     
2. Banking secrecy is why we would have external auditors do the auditing process, and that would be the proof of money going into their accounts to back the Tether

Thankyou, yes this is the exact mechanism I keep telling people they use. The promise to sell and buy for that set price is how the peg is kept.       
   For some reason there is a widespread belief that this is not how the price is kept around $1, and that they do it by controlling the total supply relative to USD on the market.     
I believe that opinion is toxic, as it is underplaying the importance that market faith has in maintaining the peg.

Someone gives Tether money, they print Tether. If lots of people change crypto&gt; Tether on exchanges, they do not print more Tether. Check their whitepaper, their FAQ, their website, you will see that is what they say.     
You seem to be misunderstanding what I am saying. They do not peg by controlling supply. They effectively peg by guarenteeing redemption and selling for a set price. If walmart sold widgets for $10 and promised to buy them back for $10, noone would be buying or selling them for much more or below that price. That is how the Tether peg functions. Walmart would not need to give away more widgets into the market when demand got too high, or burn widgets when demand was low. They would simply keep selling and buying for $10, and the market price would stay about the same as long as they stood by that promise.    
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:34:13


Why would they worry about any particular token becoming worthless? What would them worrying look like to you? Can you see inside the CFO and CEO of each exchanges mind?     


I can't think of any prominent doctors who have told me not to drink my own feces. Binance CEO offering insurance for the USDT on his exchange is just a marketing ploy. He makes plenty enough to underwrite that, and it is worth him doing so to drive new customers to his site.   


By picking on them you mean arresting them for fraud of course.   
     


The whole point is how they got those hundreds of millions. But to play along for a moment, if you think that rich people do not break the law, you are failing to see the many big cases we have heard about, eg HSBC knowingly laundering Mexican cartel money     


Yes. It isnt their job to audit Tether. Their proposed business model isnt illegal, as far as ING is concerned, it is not up to ING to make sure they only issue as much Tether as they have in their account.   


 
NO YOU DO NOT NEED TO INCREASE/DECREASE SUPPLY TO CONTROL THE PRICE! This is a much repeated falsehood. It is pegged by Tethers promise to redeem it for a set price, the markets faith in that promise, and the price that Tether sell it for. That is all you need to peg the price.     
 


I will if you and others like you stop telling people that Tether is all fine and dandy based on a bunch of nonsense, because you are either a)desperate for Bitcoin price to stay up b)being paid to say these things, or c)willfully ignorant. Thankyou.

@_date: 2018-06-16 18:56:21
not as much as you need glasses. I have said very clearly from the start that Tether print more when purchased from them. They do not however, print more when they see the demand to be high (price above $1)   
Are you really still struggling with that bit?   
Again, are you still saying it is impossible and "crazy" for a peg to be maintained by a fixed exchange rate?
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:35:14
You seem to be completely missing what I am saying.      
 
You are describing a USD purchase of Avocados (Tether), which is what I have been saying is how it is supposed to work this whole time.   
What you were saying before is that if you issued someone 10 avocados, and they went to Japan (krakan) and offer to sell them to someone else for $11 total, you would produce more avocados to dilute the market for avocados and keep the value around $1.        
I am saying that is wrong.        
If you still cannot see why that is not logical or necessary, when simply offering those avocados to everyone (and promising to buy them back) for $10 would mean the guy in japan (krakan) has no reason to pay $11, therefore keep the peg intact, then you are doomed to believe whatever you want regardless of any proof you are shown.         
I see this repeated a lot so you are not alone in believing it, you probably picked it up from someone less informed here on Reddit. I'm going to try and start a discussion/thread about it and I will link you to it if it gets any comments. It needs to be settled as it has serious implications, thinking Tether control the peg via print/burn and not buy/sell is an important distinction
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:06:22
Ugh. Your arguments are rooted purely in a desire to shit on other people, and it shows.      


frequently studied products.  This finding gives further support to the argument that
price impact is a universal phenomenon, and it behaves similarly in classical markets
and more “exotic” ones such as **Bitcoin**       
From the study I linked you. You should call those researchers and tell them how clueless they are too.    
Your own post:   
  


You literally agreed with me, but your ego is too big to admit it or you still do not understand my simple statement of saying the auction *is* selling pressure     
   
REMOVING BUYING PRESSURE IS LITERALLY, DIRECTLY, AFFECTING THE MARKET          
To continue hurling abuse when a credible study, and your own words 30 minutes ago, agree with ME, is very revealing about your character.  
   
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:31:42
Exactly yes. People don't usually want to buy it for more as they have a belief that it is available to buy and sell for $1. Buying for more is folly, selling for less foolish.     
There are a growing group of people telling everyone who listens that Tether see the price go up, then print more. Or they see it go down, and burn some. They do this to keep the price around $1.   
This is dangerous as it underplays the importance of the crowds faith in Tether^INC financial stability, and leads people to spouting a lot of rubbish about how the crypto-space works

You must be living under a nasty little rock for you to come out from under it with this sort of limited knowledge yet such a spiteful little mouth   
   
Google "market manipulation", educate yourself a little, then try coming back to this conversation when you have something worthwhile to say

@_date: 2018-06-16 15:13:58


      
I dont really personally have a problem with them buying Tether with USD profits to be honest. I do think that the relationship between finex and Tether is unhealthy though, Finex can prop Tether up when they should fail, and cause a big problem to get bigger. These are the sorts of concerns I have really, and the sorts I would expect the market to have, I guess. That it is an unhealthy partnership given the lack of transparency and potential for them to be committing a massive fraud.
 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:33:31
Reading your explanation here, it seems you have misinterpreted what I said.   
Selling the coins in the first place *is* the selling pressure. Selling them does not necessarily create more selling pressure elsewhere at that moment, no. That would be illogical.     
The act of selling them is creating the selling pressure, the coins being for sale *is* the selling pressure.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:12:29
The dictionary definition of projecting right here.    
You said that "you can argue auctions remove buying pressure from the market, but that does not affect the market."  
    
Think that through for a moment...
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:59:13
You still misunderstand or misrepresent my point.         
"The pot" as you put it, is Tethers bank account. Money goes in, Tether comes out (at least assuming they are not scamming, for the sake of this argument)     
The pot is not the worldwide crypto economy. If people buy Tether on an exchange, that does not directly result in tether being printed.      
    
I never said the supply was fixed, again this is either a strawman or a misunderstanding by you.      
You are saying Tether control the peg by pushing the USDT onto exchanges    
I am saying the free-market keeps the peg roughly at $1 due to Tethers pricing and buyback scheme.    
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:54:19
I'm not saying it should be highly regulated. We were drawing parrallels to regular stock markets.  
    
I said there would be a lot of concern if this took place in traditional markets. User concern is what libertarians will tell you is how a free market functions healthily   
If Bitfinex opaquely printing their own currency and using that to buy Bitcoin from their users, while not fulfilling their own promise of high transparency and regular audits in a way which suggests they are lying to the entire market is no more concerning to you than a guy buying bread from his own store, then I think you need to re-evaluate

The funniest thing about your posts is how clever you think you are for being familiar with basic market manipulation techniques.     
These are not difficult things to grasp.     
Sure, lets go with pump and dumps. You're telling me that  if CNBC bought a shit-ton of a stock and then filled their airtime with sensationalized news about it so they could dump the stock off for a profit, that that would not be profitable.   
   Maybe the issue here is that you are just not smart enough to see a way to profit from manipulating markets, not that I am not smart enough to own things like a news station and 10s of millions of $s to leverage with it.        
 
   &gt;You are just too much of a failure to even earn enough capital to try your bad idea scheme for yourself so you sit around on the Internet and complain that the market is really fair to poor people like you and that it is rigged for people who are rich who can use MAGIC to extract additional profits from the market using techniques you don't even understand well enough to articulate.  
   
Fruity little boy aren't you. I haven't even complained about manipulation. Partly because I've done pretty well, partly because it is par for the course and I expected it before I even invested, years ago. You have issues kid, but you do make me laugh.

This is such a cop-out. Obviously I'm not asking for you to do work lol, I am asking you to back up your statements for which there is zero proof. You make a claim, you back it up. Simple.     
The article you link to actually backs *me* up, not you:   
 


They are claiming that the withdrawal of USDT from Bitfinex is effectively a USD purchase of Tether. This is in line with what I have said. It is **NOT** Tether printing more USDT to keep the peg at $1.       
But then, I am not obligated to do this work for you. You could at least have read the article you linked to, then I wouldnt have to explain this very basic premise to someone who is adamant, without any sort of proof, rationale or reasoning, that they are right. You cant just make things up, refuse to link to proof, ignore the arguments against your statements and then say "I dont have to provide any sort of logic" and think you have proved your point.    
You have only proven mine.

I never said anything about no supply changes. You are clutching at straws.  
    
Your argument came off the rails a long time ago.     
 
I showed you how many countries use a fixed exchange rate to maintain a peg, the same way Tether describe they do in their whitepaper and on their website. The thing you said was impossible, many countries already do.      
Are you still saying it is impossible and "crazy" for a peg to be maintained by a fixed exchange rate?   
Like I said, take it up with all the countries who are currently doing exactly that. I'm done here, I'm not doing any more work for you.

And what do you think that has to do with what we were talking about lol      
Our whole conversation was working on the assumption that Tether is legit, which, btw, yesterdays news does not even come close to proving. They could have $10bn in the bank with no outstanding loans and still have acted fraudulently. Not that it matters, since, I should probably remind you since that was 2 whole sentences ago now and I know you're struggling again, *we were working on the assumption that Tether was legit*   
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:59:01
lol. Supply will increase naturally if demand rises to the point where the market values it above $1. People will go to Tether/Finex to buy it and more will get printed when it is pulled from Tether. Economics 101.   
   
The same way that demand is low and people value it at below $1. People who believe it will bounce back due to faith in Tethers promise will buy it, and support the price this way.     
Tether have never claimed to influence the price by controlling supply. You are the one making up things which there is zero evidence of, and plenty of evidence against.   
If you think it is crazy that a free market will not value something much higher or lower than $1 when an entity buys and sells unlimited amounts of that commodity for $1, then you are the crazy one. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:06:35
Actually Bitfinex claim it is USD.   


They pretty much just pool all USD and USDT together. You can deposit USDT and withdraw USD, you can deposit USD and withdraw USDT  
   
But this thread is about whether Tether print more USDT when demand is high on any exchange, and then destroy Tether when price is low, and that this is how Tether keeps its price around $1. Or whether the free-market decides the price.
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:59:07
A reliable way to tell when someone is "triggered" or not, is usually whether they go off on an abusive rant instead of sticking to the subject at hand        
This whole conversation was about Tethers proposed business model, you really have forgotten havn't you. Whoops.    
To be honest it was kind of obvious you would have to resort to either this or dead silence, you have nothing relevant to add. I did get a laugh out of your attempts though, so thanks for that       
The single thing you can do to prove me wrong, is to describe how Tether having funds in their account proves your point that it is crazy and impossible for a fixed exchange rate to act as a peg.      
Do it, and you win.     
You won't, because you can't. Because it's dumb and makes no sense.     
Go ahead and hurl some abuse instead though, it is all you have left besides giving up, which you are clearly too big-headed to do
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:33:47
this isnt true. Any extra supply satiates demand. Lower demand translates to lower prices. Maybe not immediately but it does
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:42:54


I replied to a different comment of yours just now, I think this statement is where the confusion lies. I did not say they *cause* selling pressure.   
   
Auctions *are* the selling pressure. "Causing selling pressure" is an ambiguous and frankly meaningless statement. Removing buyers from the market, whether OTC or via auction or over a desk from a corrupt official somewhere, all effects the market. Some ways more so than others, but it is all linked.

This is frankly hilarious btw
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:12:18
Yes this is pretty much exactly how it works according to Tether, in the FAQ, whitepaper, their website, and common sense.      
Still I see people insisting that Tether control the supply to keep the price around $1 by sending the exchanges more whenever demand is high. They think that Tether keep watch over the markets and control the peg.

The value of Bitcoin is largely a result of it's network effect. Or would you say a blockchain with 1 user is no more valuable than one with 10 million users?     
People did not move to Facebook because some unique tech allowed it to support 2 bill users. They moved to it because their friends were on it.     
Also if blockchain is just data storage, then so is Facebook too.

@_date: 2018-11-25 16:43:29
The same could be said for Facebook. You could clone Bitcoin today and have an identical product. The network effect is a big factor.    
You are right though, Blockchain is simple, and so is Bitcoin. That is itself a reason why there is no need to switch to hyperledger fabric or any other alternative though. Almost any desirable improvement over Bitcoin could be inserted into the code of the one with the largest network effect already.       
It's like saying Facebook has no utility and will die, because websites are simple and another website will come along with a new feature that Facebook doesn't have. Sure, maybe, but the more likely outcome is Facebook will just adopt that feature, especially in an open-source system

You can see how dressing up the crime of money laundering as something fairly innocuous and something which many people might not think was in fact making them party to money laundering is *tantamount* to entrapment. I agree that it wasnt de facto entrapment, hence the "kinda-sorta-100%" bit.  
You're right, but the example given is how it *could* be pretty devious. The same person that would be party to that transaction, would possibly say no if asked "hey dude help me launder some money please"

He is not evil. "Evil" is a label religious people use to shut down logical discussion. It is ridiculous to use the term in a discussion about technology protocols and an economic system.     
He is selfish, and he should be. There will always be people out there working in their own interests, and Bitcoin is designed precisely to work in that environment
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:08:46
Absolutely. That's the duty of the market/community. Miners have the right to be selfish, and will be, but the market also has the right to retaliate against that if they dont like what's being done. At the end of it all, we should find an equilibrium where miners and users and the general interests of Bitcoin are all aligned, and everyone is happy. But I personally dont think just calling miners evil for being selfish and concluding that we need to boot them is the answer. They can be selfish while still being beneficial to the network by securing it through their work.

But back to your point, it is daft to buy just enough BTC to pay for one simple thing you could have used your CC for, you are right. It is not so daft to hold 1k,5k,10k+++ in BTC out of reach of any corporation or gov for you to use at your convenience.

@_date: 2018-02-24 09:51:01
Not true. Miners are presumed to act in their own interests, it's part of the game theory that Bitcoin is built upon. As a fan of Bitcoin itself, selfish actions in the ecosystem at the expense of Bitcoins long term development can be seen as "evil", however they are the very foundation of Bitcoin. Remove the selfish motivations, and you are left with a network of trust.   
That said, the ASICboost thing was unfortunate and not a foreseen part of that game theory. But everything went as it was supposed to, he was financially motivated to find the bug, he found the bug, exploited it, and it was patched.

I think the problem boils down to the piece itself being the thing which needs to be authenticated, and thus is in effect a great big private key which people are hanging out in public.  
Steganography probably wouldnt cut it as you can just clone the steganography along with the art, much like forging a signature. Any visual aspect of the art can be cloned. The only way I can think of is using a canvas with a secure-enclave type processor embedded into it which can provide one time passwords to authenticate against a blockchain anchored 2FA code.

Actually that's exactly what it means, and the only way to *make sure* that they are working in Bitcoins best interests is by aligning those interests. It's precisely what Bitcoin is built upon. As before, if we are not relying on them to work in their best interests, we are relying on them to ___________      
Answer= do the right thing out of goodwill   
A network like that would be very weak. The game theory is what makes Bitcoin strong.   
 &gt;"This is like saying "The Providence of the Invisible Hand has ordained Jihad to have all the hashing power. Therefore it is good. Have faith in the Hand!"     
No it would be like saying "Bitcoin has a design flaw, where anyone with bad interests can come in and take 100% of the hashpower and make more money doing that than acting in the networks best interests." Thankfully that doesnt seem to be the case, yet. I'm with you that mining centralisation *is* an issue, and that Jihans majority *is* an issue, however just calling all miners evil and saying we should dump them is, imo, not the answer

Apologies, I was replying to a few questions along those lines and got wires crossed. That is not taking over Bitcoin though, that is merely shaping it's path. Something we should all be trying to do. If you mean his intentions were to gain control by winning the debate, I still fail to see how that gives him any control over anything other than token control over the repository, a non-issue when his control is transient and highly limited in scope. If he were a bad gatekeeper, the system would evict him.   
  


I agree. But the same could be said about people who support BTC, LukeJr for instance has been highly unethical.   
 
     


  
At the moment it splits, both chains are equal. Once one side of the fork has a clear advantage in most work performed, it earns the name Bitcoin. Bitcoin has forked many times without anyone even noticing, because the old, unchanged side of the fork is not worked on by any miners and it was an un-contentious fork. The BCH fork was a contentious fork, with the change submitted significant enough that a majority of people stayed on the old side of the fork, BTC, and that kept the name Bitcoin with the new side, BCH, earning a different name. *Neither* side of the fork had consensus before it occurred. Both had consensus afterwards. BTC just had majority support, obviously.   
  
Consensus is when everyone agrees. In this case, the disagreeing parties went seperate ways, it was not that BTC gained consensus and BCH did not, that would not make sense.       
   


Claiming that it *is* Bitcoin, may well be and usually is an attempt to mislead. I agree. Those people should say they consider it to be the real Bitcoin, but that the market does not, and volunteer to elaborate on that to avoid misleading people. Not, "BCH is Bitcoin" and leave it to the listener to work out what they mean by that.   
    
The fact that some people attempt to mislead using the name, does not make BCH a scam. Not by any measure.      


They can only suggest  changes, the power ultimately rests with the community, the users, the miners, the other devs. I'm not going to get bogged down with "who is the group that Satoshi entrusted", "who has been there since the beginning", "who aligns with who", as if those things really matter, then Bitcoin is already broken. It was never about trust or people. Satoshi could have left the repository in the hands of Kim Jong Un for all it matters, the important thing is the tech.       


 
Well, it may be saying that. The only thing we can conclude it is saying is that it values BTC over BCH. The reasons for that are not spelled out by the market. It may well just be herd mentality and resistance to change. It could be the scaling approach. It could be concerns over miner control as you say. It could be a number of things, all acting together with the result being what we see.       
What is clear, is that BTC is Bitcoin by virtue of having the most work. BCH is not Bitcoin, as it does not.    
Attempting to take over Bitcoin is a broad statement that needs to be narrowed in scope. Once you understand that you cannot take over Bitcoin by controlling a repository, or submitting a proposal which earns him no advantage over others (blocksize increase), and that you can only really take over Bitcoin by controlling the opinion of the majority of wealth invested, it is hard to call BCH a scam.        
It's a blocksize increased, with the repo managed by the people supporting that increase. Oh, and some people think that it is "the real Bitcoin" as designed, and express that poorly, or misleadingly.

ok sure, the person who only has 2 btc is arguably more likely to sell half, as they are clearly less affluent. It is far more likely that someone with only a little cash has a sudden unexpected need for 1btcs worth of fiat, than it is a highly wealthy person to have a sudden unexpected need for 25,000 btcs worth of fiat.    
So, back to your statement, what is the logic? I dont see it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:16:49
Payments from BCH wallets to BTC wallets do go through, because the wallet address naming convention is the same. ie. There is a corresponding BCH wallet for every BTC wallet with the same address (although maybe not true for wallets created under certain upgraded patches since the fork, I'm not sure).   
I have said before that Ver should not call BCH Bitcoin in wallet software, he is free to call it "the real Bitcoin as Satoshi intended" as that is a matter of opinion, but calling it "Bitcoin" in his literature is going beyond that

that is not the coin, that is certain actions taken by certain people who support the coin.   
Its like saying BTC is a scam because LukeJr wants to make people think only certain types of bitcoin transaction are legit, and the rest should be censored.    
BCH can be a perfectly legit currency despite the actions taken by certain supporters.  
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:37:14
and to get even more basic, currencies are borne through adoption. If something that is not a currency cannot become a currency, then we would never have had any currencies at all.

That's not how consensus works though    
If they stayed, then there wasn't consensus and wouldnt be unless either side changed their opinion, which they had indicated they wouldnt.      
So the original group of participants (everyone using Bitcoin before the BCH fork), forked into two groups, both now having social consensus over their scaling objectives. Consensus among network participants is a different thing entirely, it is describing how everyone complies with the rules to come to a consensus over what the transaction history and state of the network is   
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:02:29

@_date: 2018-07-25 11:15:56


Offering an alternate version of a product is not a scam. There would need to be a lot more at play to justify calling it a scam.   
    


   
This is irrelevant to whether BCH is a scam or not      
    


That's fine, the chain which is Bitcoin is decided by the market, not the devs. If it were the devs, that would be a horribly centralised model, don't you think?   
  


Taken control, again, how exactly would they be exerting control? Anyone is free to develop and propose bips for BCH. If ABC would have taken control by having people use BCH, then Blockstream *have* taken control by the fact that people are preferring to use BTC. In that light, how is a blockstream controlled BTC better than an ABC controlled BCH?        
I'm not taking a side here, I'm hoping this can be a civil discussion where we are honest with eachother
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:40:42
Exactly yes :) If Bitcoin can not survive attacks, it is unfit for purpose and unworthy of our attention. It needs to be tested, dragged through the mud, and survive.

Exactly. In this case, you are the scammer. The shoes are not a scam. There is a market for Abidas shoes, they have certain qualities which some people prefer over the adidas shoes (namely, being cheaper)      


Ok.     


A simple statement of opinion does nothing for what you're saying. I like chocolate more than BCH. That doesn't make it better. I have a large holding of LTC, but even I know that LTC sacrifices security for speed and cost via shallower proof of work requirements. It's not technically superior, there is nothing about it which could qualify it as that. So why do I hold so much? Because it is well positioned in a BTC dominant future, which it seems we are heading for.       


I mean that's just you making baseless claims. Anyone can do that about anything.

**tldr** its not about being right every time. Its about being right sufficiently enough to make more money than you lose

How does an even distribution increase demand and price of a currency
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:46:08
close, but not quite true. It could be fake money by exchange insiders. It could be real money, but borrowed on margin. So the money they have on deposit with the exchange is possibly far lower (I think BFX do 10x margin so 1/10th, I forget)

Its great that people are participating in the process, but please try and put some effort into your comment if you make on. We don't want the majority of the pro-ETF comments to be poorly thought out pseudo-spam, it will only make their job harder

he is not unknown. It doesnt matter what anyone says, what matters is the truth behind their statements

you could combine this with some stenography to make good electronically stored seed backups. Just beware of compression-artifacts, general data loss and degradation, and things like naming it "BITCOIN SEED BACKUP"

so do I, but this was posted by cobra. Linked to on his Twitter. Its not some hack (well, that depends on how you view cobra himself but you know what I mean...)

and itself more true to the bitcoin revolution than pledging allegiance to the brand, "Bitcoin"

adoption is a gradual process, peer by peer. Big influential peers will help speed up that process

Bitcoin doesnt want your thanks. Bitcoin isnt about making people rich. Its about making people free.

A forced exchange is forced forfeiture of one asset in return for one they did not request. I'm not playing semantics, it's literally what it is. I'm not suggesting anything, fiat currency is fiat currency. What happened was oppressive under any definition of the word.    
I'm struggling to see what your stance is on this apart from "it was no big deal"
  
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:08:26
You're absolutely right. I still think I am too though :)     
The primary value Bitcoin brings to society is freedom and empowerment, the value rising is a secondary effect of that. That is not assertion, but fact, as it is the removal of a trusted intermediary which makes Bitcoin what it is, and the intentions of the original designer (for what little his initial intentions are really worth in the grand scheme of things), was to remove the shackles of the traditional monetary system from people worldwide.    
   
By all means the OP should enjoy his rewards for investing well, there's just an annoyingly large number of people who see Bitcoin as nothing but a get rich quick scheme and posts like this kind of encourage that mindset. Not that he is one of those people or that it's particularly bad to think like that, I just wanted to do my little part of reminding people that Bitcoin is more than a gravy train. It is a real freedom machine, in the same way OPs new purchase is more than just a vehicle 
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:35:48
is this really going to be the most upvoted comment in the thread?  
When criticised for lack of freedom of speech, the best retort is to express a desire to shut down their freedom of speech too?      
Bashco says that censorship here is not censorship, it is to improve the quality of debate by keeping out trolls, shills, those who wish to subvert bitcoins current consensus. Refer to that, *prove* that if you can, if you cannot prove it, be prepared to call it false even if you feel it hurts your pride to agree with people you disagree with on other matters.      
Grow some fucking balls Bitcoin **CAN** save babies. That's what this is all about
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:15:41
great :) Again it wasnt meant as an attack on you sorry, just a reminder to people in general that it is more than something to make people rich. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:59:34
I just mean, thanking Bitcoin isnt really thanking Bitcoin. How can I put it... it's like thanking someone for accidentally helping you. Like if someone forgot their umbrella at a store, it starts raining, you use the umbrella. You can't really give them a sincere thankyou, they never meant to leave it at the store for you.   
Does that make sense? :)    
I'm just trying to say that Bitcoin isnt designed to be this get-rich-quick thing that a lot of people see it as. You probably already know, it was a passing comment really.    
Enjoy the bike anyway! :)
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:28:28
Yes. Many. Most of the comments in this thread are toxic af and seem to be made by people who have only recently learnt what cryptocurrency is
@_date: 2018-07-26 02:06:28


I mean that you can have social consensus before deviating from network consensus, eg the NYA.     


It was clear that this would be a contentious fork, but that in no way makes it illegitimate. It is Bitcoin working as intended. People voted with their dollars, and BTC won, which I have no problem with.   
     


BCH did not, I'm guessing you mean Ver did, right? I have no doubt that Blockstream or others have orchestrated the same against BCH, it is simply good business sense for them to do so. Adam.Back has alluded as much. That doesnt make BTC a scam though, as I'm sure you agree.  
 
  
I agree that misleading people that BCH=Bitcoin is unethical. But I disagree that it makes BCH a scam.    
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:13:28
Its ok to say "Bitcoin Cash is closer to the original concept of Bitcoin". I mean that's up for debate, but it's an ethically sound claim to make if that is what you believe. It is not ok to say "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin that you see talked about on the news, I'm selling some for only $1500!"    
One is an ideological debate. The other is straight up trying to scam people.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:08:30


It doesnt matter what people believed. It was forced forfeiture of assets in return for fiat currency. It's oppressive as fuck, imagine if Zimbabwe did that. You can totally imagine them doing it because it's messed up as fck, right
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:50:28
Yes, actually. If the market wants your coin, great. People who want a different sort of Bitcoin can still find that
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:42:23
That's for a conviction. Being guilty in the eyes of society is different.  
If you see someone do something, do you assume it did not happen until a court tells you it did?
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:41:04
I'm not talking about McAfee specifically. You said you don't consider anyone guilty of anything before tried in court. I get what you are saying, but it's not how society works, nor how it should work. We should still consider evidence based on it's merits of course though.
