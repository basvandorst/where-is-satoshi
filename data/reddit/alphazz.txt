I'm rather new in crypto and i understand there is BTC price and USD price of a coin. When i invest 1 BTC in a coin thats 1 USD/coin and it raises to 2 USD/coin but BTC also triples in price, then yes i get less BTC but i still made money in USD, right? Am i being retarded there? And i understand everyone's opinions about how it's better to hold BTC instead of USD. But if i convert into BTC, invest instantly in an altcoin and it raises then no matter what's the price of BTC i made money and can cash out more. Is my logic wrong? So hard to grasp it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:10:52
Bitcoin has yet to come up with solutions to it's current problems. For it to reach 100k means it gained the global recession you talk about, and it won't unless it can scale for worlds need. Without actual solutions to it's blocks size and the way they store blockchain currently there's no way we reach 100k 2020.

To be fair i see hard fork as a positive thing, actually. People will be selling alts and putting more cash into bitcoin just for the sake of getting free, hard forked money. Thus creating an artificial pump and moving the price of Bitcoin up, possibly breaking us from the bear trend if it keeps until then, though it's still far away as 1 month in crypto is more than enough for things to happen.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:50:11
Comparing database to blockchain? (facepalm)
Bitcoin is where it is only because it was the first token, network effect works for it. Many other cryptocurrencies already surpassed Bitcoin in every way possible - be it either privacy, transaction speed, tx per second, functionality or anything else.

Not an ICO, an existing token and that's not the purpose of the coin.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:12:25
Are there some kind of levels, like throughout the time you can deposit more? 2500$ is more than enough, considering i can get the other 1500$ from a few other limited exchanges around. So i guess i'll try coinbase, though recently the drama about them being not available during dips (offline) makes me feel like that's a wrong move.

See, the best way of crypto is to not be bothered by small swings and daily changes but still, keep track of what is going on. And have alerts if you are into altcoins. If you plan on just hodling bitcoin, then go enjoy your life and see you in a few years. But altcoins unlike bitcoin don't have such a bright future. Many of them will die sooner or later so if as you say, you have money in some other coins - keep track of what's going on, and be ready to take some off the table when price goes to heavens. Because it may not ever hit this heaven again. With bitcoin it's different though.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:27:30
Yea, last time situation was similar with support and resistance and people spammed 1500$ too and some expected 1300$. 1800$ was the lowest though, you can't predict bitcoin.

It is a simple correction, one does not simply increase by 22% in matter of a few hours and keep that pace. Will probably keep rising considering bip91 is locked in.

Read your post once again please, and think twice of where you gave me any kind of arguments. You are just speculating, have no proof and just because other services of this type are often scams doesn't mean this one is as well. I wanted to just say a story of my friend's and i did, and i don't care if it's ponzi or not. But i am not going to argue over it with someone that is blindfolded this way and has completely no idea what he's talking about. I'll just disable my inbox replies so i don't have to ruin my day with another portion of stupidity. Have a good one!
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:45:14
What does it mean that TX will show as unverified? I wanted to get the BCC and dump them instantly on an exchange, as i don't believe it will survive but it is free money after all. But there's all this confusion and some people say when you spend BCC, you spend BTC as well? What?
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:36:57
All these solutions are only short-term anyways. If we keep just doubling the block size then we will reach a point at which nodes won't keep up with the amount of GB to download. If we want to improve bitcoin a bit and get it to 10-20k per coin, sure. If we want to give bitcoin even a small possibility of becoming a worldwide daily-base currency/asset - not happening. VISA can handle 21000 transactions per second. Bitcoin accepts 3 transactions per second. Good luck reaching even 1000 transactions per second without any real changes. For now bitcoin still has bright future, but segwit is just delaying our problem, not fixing it. I'm sure the current bitcoin can reach around 20.000$ to 25.000$ per coin in this shape and form. Although without major revolutionary changes in near future, bitcoin will end up stuck at 20k and we will have to switch to a different coin that has the same usage but a better code.

Hey, people said bitcoin is a ponzi scheme back in 2011. Well, surprise surprise. I don't even use genesis and don't plan to as i'm hodling myself. It's possible what ur saying is true, but it's possible it's not. Maybe it's a legitimate company, and maybe it's one that once they stop profiting will exit scam. Who the hell knows honestly, i just know my friend made a fortune off that and continues to get money every single day.
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:51:08
What you described is the so called swing trading. If you want to swing trade, do not do that on Bitcoin. In the long run bitcoin became less volatile and will become less and less. Go for altcoins, things you also believe have great future but the price is a lot more volatile.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:28:51
The problem is that you can't click purchase before you get any funds in your account, and once you have funds in your account and click purchase then the BTC transfer is instant anyways, so what is the idea of locked rate if there's no reason for it. That's why i'm asking if i can somehow lock rate now and add funds then pay for it, but seems not possible.

I know how many he invested and how much he earned, tho i'm not gonna share stuff about my friends money or my money on the internet, obviously.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:49:36
Agree. I was laughing my ass off at my friend back in the past when he told me he will get rich from genesis. He invested money and kept on re-investing all profits for a full year. I kept on telling him this is a scam like any other and that it's better to do the same as me - invest and hodl. He is now 8 months on profits, so all the money he invested came back to him and he's now earning only and his paychecks are bigger than mine from my business. I'm still glad i didn't take the risk because it was just too big considering the amount of scam sites in this industry. Sometimes better to get less but safely.

Get a hardware wallet, worth it for sure. I paid extra for delivery and got my trezor 2 days later.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:13:23
I believe only a few of exchanges are gonna support BCC, and most of them are no-name exchanges excluding one of chinese giants Huobi. Private keys are pretty much like a key to your bank of bitcoins. They hold the bitcoins, and because you store your stuff on an exchange it's the exchange that hold private keys for you. So technically, those coins aren't even yours. You may want to read a bit about Mt.Gox or Bitfinex hacks. If you think when an exchange gets hacked, insurance policy will refund everything then you're very wrong. Having your coins on a hardware wallet or cold storage, or just a online wallet that you own (electrum thats connected to internet for example) is the most important thing!
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:34:10
Okay then let's compare it to something else then. 9.55t$ is close to more than US Dollars in circulation if you take 12t$ as the number of dollars as there are different ways to calculate it but that's the highest one pretty much. Anyone can agree that USD will crumble and there has to be a currency that will take it's place. Bitcoin is the best option obviously, though there are still fixes to do. And yet, even with bitcoin surging and usd falling at the same time to a useless paper i can't see BTC going 500k$ in 3 years.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:50:19
As jcoinner mentioned below, it really doesn't matter whether your hardware wallet breaks because you can buy another one and import your account with bitcoins into that new one using seed. You can also use the seed to import it into any other wallet that support 24-word seeds, and there is MANY. I don't think a wallet can malfunction honestly, it also protects from any type of virus so you're free to use it even on a pc with keyloggers. It has better security than paper wallet and is very easy to use, even if your trezor gets stolen they don't know the pin code, so it's all good. You can see all security threats and answers here:
Checking 30 pin codes takes 17 years. And you can use passphrase for maximum security too (like an additional password). And you can make infinity amount of wallets on trezor and each one stored behind a different passphrase. It is a protection from for example blackmail or if some thugs come in and want to beat you up if you don't give them the access to trezor. You can then give them passphrase of account that's empty or has a few bucks and leave out the one you keep all money on.
Also if you want to invest into other currencies in the future you can store them on trezor too. Etherum, Ethereum Classic, ZCash, Litecoin, Namecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, and all ERC-20 Tokens (all Etherum based tokens so EOS, FUN and 100+ more) can be stored on trezor.

Does that mean that dates haven't changed? Just everyone agreed on BIP91 early but dates that were previously announced like 1st of August are still correct? Did i understood that right? Sorry, just honestly confused because i was looking to buy some more btc in case there's a second dip. I'm waiting for it, worst case i'll buy on the 2.4-2.5k but if dates changed then i should probably hurry to put all on cold storage and wait in case chain split happens, right?
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:57:42
Oh well, a lot of advanced terms that i don't understand. Guess it's time to read all about what are nodes, utxo, pre-fork, bip148, segwit, uasf and all these terms appearing every day that i have no idea of. Wanted to just hold some bitcoins and wait for them to increase in price then sell after a few years. Everything looked great until the heated discussion about 1st August begun and Electrum was to be my savior. Just looking to confirm whether electrum will be safe to hold btc in, or find the best wallet for now.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:09:37
No. You should be extremely careful sending/receiving funds 12 hours and before the fork tho.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:33:01
You do realize that i haven't yet purchased even and am waiting for the correction to finish to buy in on a low? You are the typical reddit kid that has no idea of anything and yet tries to prove how smart he is. Head back to my previous reply, if you think anything that only grows is healthy for you then go back to economic class. Every single thing on marketplace will have push-backs, corrections. Bitcoin still 400% increase over a year, it's a simple correction due to reaching all time high of 3100$ too fast. I'm wondering, are you some super bitcoin-opposed player just spamming bullshit here to make people lose trust in bitcoin, or are you just THAT stupid? :\
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:55:18
Sorry but if you do not understand my point then we have nothing to talk about. My comment was pretty much pointing out how stupid your ideology is. Saying that one day gold is going up and btc/eth down means completely nothing. If you live in a world where everything that's successful on the marketplace goes only up and you think that's healthy, then you really may want to take the economic class again. No offence mate, just go read your comment again and understand how it simply doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:18:39
That's a jump from 42b$ to 9.55t$ if you take in consideration there will be around 19.1m bitcoins in 3 years from now and a price of 500.000$ per bitcoin.
That's more than the current entire gold value. This will not happen, let's be real. Bitcoin if anything at best will hit a 50.000$ mark in 2021/2022. There's still a lot to take care of before BTC goes into daily life of everyone. Especially increasing the limit of bitcoin's transactions per second. But yes, we just need to fix our problems and live through them. Once bitcoin reaches around 35.000$ or 40.000$ the snowball will just begin. Money does not come from nowhere, there's a limited amount of money in the world. Hitting 40.000$ mark in 2020-2022 would mean bitcoin achieved a 1 trillion market cap. Something this big cannot be ignored and will only snowball from that point on because other investment options will lose value due to a new competition.
Astonishing though how bitcoin within just a few years from it's creation may end up having more value than gold. I do believe if we reach 500.000$ per bitcoin - it will happen at best in 2027/2028.

It's about increasing transactions per block, and increasing block size. Lightning network still doesn't solve the issue of transactions per second and scalability of bitcoin in the future. So you still did not answer my issues in the post above, lol.

He's about to pass me in profits soon even though i invested around the same time. The point is he's getting paid in Bitcoin and if BTC reaches 100k$ tommorow then from that point i probably will never ever buy a full bitcoin again because of too high price. He will get that full bitcoin within a week or two of payments from mining.

@_date: 2017-07-03 18:10:44
Second/third this question. This is probably the most important question for all people holding - what is going to happen to people holding their bitcoin in cold storages? There has to be a ton of people hodling like me, on external drive/pendrives stored in different places. Wallet is on Electrum, got my private keys too. Should i worry about anything? I also send some cash to that cold storage once per week. Can i keep doing that or will it work negatively in some kind of a way?
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:19:47

Is this really such a big issue with coinbase? I send bank transfers and receive them next day, always. When i withdrawn euro once it took them 2 days so very good. BTC is always instant for me to withdraw? Max. 15 minutes delay if they have the "delay announcement" on.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:09:53
You're getting paid with BTC and not USD on Genesis Mining. If they pay you 0.1 BTC per day then even if BTC skyrockets to a price of 10.000$ tommorow, you still get paid 0.1 BTC per day. So that's not working how you think it does.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:36:18
I mean, tranceology is right. I bought in on 2500$ and i don't feel rich even though i'm holding some. Those that paid the same 2500$ when price was 100$ got 25btc now and can sell them for 2500$ each. That's 62 500$. If BTC goes to 50k we, those that bought in on 2500$ will be in the same very situation. Those that buy in on 40-50k though, won't feel rich like i don't feel right now. That's how market works for those that go along with the strategy of holding.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:14:29
It will be trading BCC, not announced how yet. Whether it's BCC/USD or BCC/BTC market. I have the lowest verification on bitfinex and am trading freely. You can't withdraw USD obviously, but you can buy BTC and transfer it to ex. Coinbase and sell them there, or transfer them to your wallet to hodl.

Uh... becomes troublesome when you own 20 altcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:24:00
People that invest their money should really think through what is their plan. Because if you wanted to just invest and hodl and you ended up selling, then you're doing something wrong. It's a common mistake to buy high and sell low when we should do the opposite. Weak hands though, i have made this mistake as well and bought in on 2500$. I did not even flinch seeing the prices going down, i was actually happy that i'll be able to buy more on a dip and so i did. A real hodler should not be even thinking about the current price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-03 04:37:07
Hey, you seem to be well-informed and very helpful to the other guy. I also hold my bitcoins on Electrum cold wallet and all i do is just send more bitcoins to that cold storage once per few weeks. If electrum announced to support BIP148, does it mean anything harmful for a person that just holds? I have zero idea on what's happening, just looking to hold my bitcoins until 2020/2021 then sell. Trying to get informed on what's going on and am worried that by keeping my btc on Electrum i'll make them worthless.
