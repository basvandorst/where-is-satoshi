No wonder, with reports like this one:
@_date: 2014-09-26 13:33:42
How is the amount of work related to the amount of people who spend bitcoins? How will more transactions generate a "tremendous" need for proof of work when hashing power is unrelated to usage?
Also, I'm not buying their key replicas until they start using the heat they now waste whilst producing them to warm up cans of beans for local homeless shelters. What about the data centers that host their website? Doesn't the fact that they made shipping "FREE" stimulate users to buy one key at a time? Nature cries.
I'm all for green solutions, but, to me, their statements make no sense at all. The fact that all Bitcoin users benefit from the network security and no one from the results is what makes it reliable.
Making the world "better" is a vague statement and very subjective, too. Who would decide what riddles the miners need to solve?

I chose to use it because it's based in Sweden, uses no Google Analytics or other trackers on it's website and has a great [privacy policy](
Private Internet Access is a no go for me, because apart from them serving trackers on their site, their FAQ contains some obvious falsehoods like:


In the European Union, only internet service providers need to log traffic data and store it between 12 and 36 months, VPN providers don't. They also ignore the leakage of secret gag orders US-based companies like Lavabit received.
Mullvad having exit nodes in the USA could indeed influence their position when it comes to compliance. I'll definitely send them an email to ask them why they offer them and how it affects them as that's a pretty strange move indeed.

I'm a very happy user of bitWallet. It's available in the App Store, allows you to watch addresses, request payments and generate transactions with imported private keys.
Note that you'll have to broadcast said transaction yourself, but that's as simple as pasting it into a given form in Safari.
@_date: 2014-03-20 01:51:07
I have stumbled across this mini guide:
1. Copy your public receiving addresses from Bitcoin-Qt.
2. Go to the Bitcoin-Qt console: click Help/Debug Window and then select the Console tab.
3. Run dumpprivkey OurReceivingBitcoinAddress for each receiving address you want to migrate to MultiBit.
4. Copy the results of dumprivkey for each address (which are the corresponding private keys).
5. Start the Multibit client and create a new wallet if you have none.
6. Click Tools/Export Private Key after selecting the Do not password protect export file option.
7. Open the exported file in a text editor.
8. Below the private key generated by MultiBit, paste the private keys you have copied above. Remember to paste them before the End of private keys line.
9. After each private key, add a date that is prior to when you created the corresponding wallet. (You can check this date in the Bitcoin-Qt Transactions tab and scrolling to the very bottom.)
10. Repeat for all addresses you want to move to Multibit Client.
11. Save the key file and import it to the Multibit client using Tools/Import Private Keys.
12. In order to not leave private keys around, delete and trash the key files that you used.
13. Et voila, you have just moved your wallet to the MultiBit client.
Source: [Bitcoin Answers (adavid)](
It's quite a hassle but might be done sooner than Bitcoin-Qt's full sync. Should you decide to do this: I would advise you to keep your original wallet until you're sure of the fact that your keys have been succesfully imported into MultiBit.
I hope it helps and good luck! 
PS The money your friend has sent you has arrived. Your wallet's private key(s) merely serve as proof that you are the owner of the funds your friend has sent you. You don't need to keep Bitcoin-Qt running to get the Satoshi to arrive at your address(es).

Also, I am not trying to "spin" anything. I'm merely stating that simply saying one thing doesn't outperform the other without providing people with any form of context is vague.
If you were to claim that you outperform me, my first question would be: "At what?".

You cannot create your own phrase, because it's deterministic and you cannot pick specific private and public keys.
Let's assume that you have a password with lowercase and uppercase characters and digits (including some of the most popular special ones). That would mean that you have about (26+26+10+35=) 62 options per character.
According to [Wolfram Alpha]( there are about 600.000 words in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.
Which means:
600.000^12 = 2,176782336×10⁶⁹ possible sentences.
That's extremely secure by today's standards, especially in combination with BIP38 (a standard process to encrypt Bitcoin and crypto currency private keys that is imprevious to brute force attacks).

With Pheeva you do not own any bitcoin. What you get is "trial access" (I'm not making this up) to a wallet they host and own.
The reason I use bitWallet is that it means I own the imported private key. That means that I do not have to rely on said iOS app or some third party service to be able to access my own funds. Let alone on a "free trial" basis. Plus, it's available in the App Store.

Great work! I really like the design, it's user friendly and smart. One thing that bugs me though is the backup procedure. I don't use iTunes at all to restore my device.
What I'd like to see is some kind of deterministic backup procedure. Upon creating your wallet, you receive a collection or words or whatever that you can use to regenerate your private key.
I would not mind losing my wallet upon doing something like updating iOS or clearing my browsing data, as long as restoring it is simple and straightforward.
Fixing that would hands down make this my number one choice for carrying a few millibitcoins around for small purchases.
Nice start, I'll keep an eye on this.

I don't agree with the point you're trying to make with regards to privacy.
Let's say someone wins a lottery and his or her name and city pop up on television. I then use an online phone book to determine their exact address. I go there and take pictures of their house, car, street and of all of the family members as they leave the house and walk across the city. I then mark all the locations they visit on an interactive map. I bundle everything and create a neat Rich Internet Application to present it to everyone who might be interested.
Every separate action I took was lawful and anyone could start collecting and ordering all of that information by him or herself.
What I'm saying is that (at least for me), there's a huge difference between a rough transaction ledger and a tool purposefully designed to map other people's spending habits and whatnot.

Grooveshark lets you browse and listen to songs without having to have any kind of membership. Discovery awaits!


BitTorrent is a protocol, not a service. Services that allow you to share culture need to be funded. The Pirate Bay and Kickass Torrents are funded through ads and donations. 
Note that these "look-up" services do not have the overhead of having to offer live music streaming. When you pay for Grooveshark or listen to its audio ads, you're rewarding them for the services they offer.
Library space for songs, unlimited ad-free streaming, native mobile apps, the desktop app. Paying $5 per month for using up that much bandwidth is very reasonable. They're not selling us your songs.

I like the fact that you're this excited about Bitcoin and it's a great initiative.
Here are a couple of things I would probably point out:
• Thuisbezorgd.nl, DeOnlineDrogist.nl and even Zynga are already making use of the Bitcoin payment system. Show him Bitcoin endorsing brands that are well known. Popular brands from your home country will probably spark a feeling of trust and familiarity. You could visualize it by making a sheet featuring all of the company logos.
• Transactions cannot be reversed. Unhappy customers will need to file a complaint with your company. This differs from payment providers like PayPal. They can arbitrarily reverse a completed payment as soon as a customer files a complaint with them.
• It's a new and innovative piece of technology and adopting it gives people the impression that the company is bold, adventurous and flexible.
• Be very clear about the fact that volatility is not an issue here and that BitPay only asks a 1% fee (and 0% for $30 per month) where methods like PayPal and Credit Cards have substantially higher fees. 
From what I remember, PayPal's fees are over 2% (I urge you to double check that before contacting your boss though). To visualize that you could stress that even if you have a free BitPay account, PayPal is over 100% more expensive.
Edit (additional point):
• If you are willing to invest a tiny bit of Bitcoin in it, the best visualization would probably be showing him a payment. 
You could buy a gift card or something else. Make sure you use a one tap payment wallet to emphasize the simplicity. The effect of an instant green BitPay bar after pressing the payment button will surely soothe any worries he might have about Bitcoin being "a toy for geeks".
Regarding the examples: I assume that you're Dutch. 
I hope this helps you out.
The best of luck!

It stores the wallets in local storage. This means that updating iOS or emptying the browser cache will erase your wallet.
Features for preventing loss:
* Since a recent update it allows you to export a BIP38 encrypted key (I personally prefer this one).
* Coin Pocket wallets can, alternatively, be backed-up through iTunes for desktop.

It most certainly is more secure than WhatsApp, but even back when WhatsApp was still using symmetric encryption I had no problem using it.
The reason I left WhatsApp is not because I expect a messaging app to offer me military grade encryption, but because I don't like it when companies buy services I use to expand their big data profiles.
For me, Telegram is a great alternative and I like the fact that it has (unofficial) web and desktop clients.
I have used services like ChatSecure too using an XMPP account, but it doesn't come close in terms of usability. I especially dislike the always expiring background session.
Other alternatives like Threema have closed source client applications.

Want to know why Overstock has a lot of Bitcoin customers and others like the Humble Bundle haven't? Take a look at the Humble Bundle [checkout page]( and see how they've camouflaged the option.
Companies who obscure the "Pay with Bitcoin" link, because they are afraid it might confuse customers shouldn't complain in my opinion.
They have even [removed and re-added]( the option in the past which left a lot of people thinking they stopped accepting it.

One of the key figures behind this (Alexander Klöpping) has a very positive stance on Bitcoin and used to own some.

If trying to give a broke girl something of value kills the romance then maybe that says more about the girl than about what you're actually giving her.
I once dated a girl who told me she was threatened into paying a fine for allegedly torrenting a movie. I decided to buy her VPN access and set it up for her.
Guess what? Even after showing her a video that told her how and why she could not be harassed by such companies anymore, she told me that she didn't want to use it.
She (needlessly) paid a €400 fine and still wasn't interested in protecting the IP that allowed media companies to obtain her potential identity through her provider.
Does that mean VPN wasn't a solution to her problem or that she was simply too narrow minded to benefit from my advice?
There's a reason my ex got the fine in the first place and there's also a reason the romance killing girl you know is broke.
If she refuses to accept a gift that's valuable, allows her to go shopping and is tradable for other currencies and she doesn't take the time to understand what it actually is, then she either isn't all that broke, has a certain amount of distrust in you or isn't all too bright and accepting in general.
It's like a beggar on the streets who looks extremely hungry and then tells you she doesn't want your chocolate chip cookie because you don't know exactly how much calories it contains.
All she really had to do to obtain money was pick an exchange and collect it. That was too much for her to handle, so she decided to turn the (seemingly romantic) situation into something awkward.
Not your fault, not Bitcoin's fault.
No free money for her.

What you (and quite a few others) call a microbit, is technically a microbitcoin.
This might be easier to grasp:
* 1 bit = 1 microbitcoin

Exactly. I think that the main problem with Doge is that it can not be a joke and a serious player at the same time. It seems that it's having an identity crisis at the moment. 
It's either a cheap, parody coin with a dog meme on it for people who don't take life too seriously or a serious competitor to Bitcoin. It can't be both.
I'm not sure wether this founder made a smart move by stating that he is a serious guy who closely analyzes these markets.

Well if someone does not use the possibility to provide a return address and sends his or her payment through someone else, then that person should know that whatever he or she is sending will not be coming back in case something goes wrong.
If I send a letter with a random address behind "from" and no "return to" address to the wrong receiving address, I can be sure that I won't be getting it back. It will be sent to the owner of the random "from" address instead.
Same story. I think the donation should be returned to the from address regardless.

They are offering a "trial" without a clear expiration date and send promotion emails without an unsubscribe link.
This is where you enlist:
Nowhere does it say when this "free trial" ends and you'll have to start paying for having access to your own wallet.
They even briefly cut me off while I was testing it out. Am I missing something?
There might not be many alternatives, but this is definitely a no-go for me. I'm glad you're enjoying their services though.

I'm glad your first Bitcoin purchase was a success. I have also used it to buy VPN access from Mullvad last week.
Their payment system was pretty cool. Instead of using services like BitPay, they give you a Bitcoin address.
You can fill it up to a specific amount to receive the corresponding amount of access time. Your account is nothing more than a randomly generated number, so you don't even need to enter your email address.
You can make their service generate a new payment address at any time. I thought that was a pretty neat and original mechanism.
It's things like that and stories like yours that get and keep me hyped up about Bitcoin as a payment method.

Actually, you've interpreted my reply correctly and I'm pretty surprised by how similar our thoughts on this subject turn out to be.
I respect your positive attitude towards openly sharing your creations and do agree with you on the fact that people should not be able to sell your works to others without giving you a fair cut.
I now better understand your original aversion towards it. The reason I support initiatives like this is, indeed, the fact that they market a handy service and not the content it eventually delivers.
I'm afraid that the result of suing and shutting down the smaller music streaming services will be that a few large ones with plenty of lawyers and lobbyists do get to set the price due to a lack of competition.

The only wallet service that I've tried to use as a pocket wallet is CoinJar. I don't know if it's the best one out there, but the app worked reasonably well when I tried it. Worth mentioning is that it's available for iOS as well.
I don't feel like (and wouldn't encourage) using these kinds of services as a way to store your Bitcoin fortune, but they are a neat for carrying some change around.
Nio Card looks like a cool product, but might be a bit too much for the task at hand. I've never used it so I can't really judge it. 
The idea of opening a wallet for him and showing him how easy it is to transfer money to it sounds pretty good. 
You could try to emphasize the fact that you're thrilled to show him how easy it is to set up a wallet and don't really stress the notion that you just gave him something. That way, it's way more likely that it won't (unjustly) look like a strange attempt to buy his vote on the subject.

The main problem is that nowadays anyone with a Macbook Pro and Garageband thinks he or she is a great musician and somehow deserves to be able to live off of it.
A true artist performs and a true artist with great works should have no trouble filling up his or her concert halls.
Even in the old days, anyone could use your sheets to play your songs, but people often traveled to hear the original composer play his or her song "the way it was meant to be played".
There is nothing wrong with sharing culture and once a lot of people get to know you and get addicted to your songs (assuming your songs are the pearls you portray them to be), they'll be standing in line to hear you live.
If you don't think people will be lining up to see you once they've listened to your songs, then I think you've found yourself a great personal hobby.
That's how I see it. Preventing services from familiarizing people with your cultural works is something I'll never get.

People who want to move the responsibility of keeping their money safe from them to someone else, would be better off using a party that you can share a transaction signature with and that's one of the areas where Bitcoin shines.
If I store my money at a regular bank, they can move a great percentage of my money out (and around) without notifying me.
This leads to fractional reserve banking. The numbers on people's bank accounts do not prove that banks actually have the money to provide these people with their savings.
Bitcoin makes it possible to have banks who store one half of the signature. This means that they still have the ability to refuse transactions, but that they cannot use your money without your permission.
Also, cautious clients can keep an eye on the blockchain to find out if the savings remain untouched. 
People who like to have their money insured can do so without giving up total control and that's a great leap forward in my opinion.
That said, I do not use a Bitcoin bank.

I was interested in the original app, but the one thing that kept me from using it was the fact that you needed to back your phone up through iTunes to back-up your wallet.
I never got how that could simplify things for non-technical people. It adds requirements and I think it makes the process more hazy.
The app is impressive though and I'm glad that you've decided to fork it. I really like the changes and I'll try them out soon.

Vendors can choose to receive payments through BitPay or other payment processors, but that does not mean that those entities have control over all of your personal transactions. If you buy a good or service from someone then you will currently have to put trust into their payment mechanism. That's way different from one party controlling all of your transactions.
Nowhere did I tell you that you "shouldn't have got into bitcoin in the first place". I merely told you that I wasn't sure why you got into bitcoin. You're the one who's cursing and becoming hostile. Plus, you were the one who started off by stating that "Most of these comments aren't helpful". So let's both keep in mind that there are people who think different from ourselves, okay?
I sincerely believe that if you do not hold the private key of your bitcoins, you do not own any bitcoins. If you disagree and don't mind the fact that you're not in control of your private key in return for comfort, I'm fully okay with that.

It being upside down makes quite the difference. The original "eye of providence" or "all-seeing eye" is a symbol that represents a god (or a few "enlightened" ones) watching over humankind.
I'm pretty sure this represents the fact that we (the majority) are aware of them and that we're staring back. I like it and it doesn't scare me. It also explains the name "dark wallet".

I'm not sure what makes you think that a decimal point does not belong to Bitcoin, but I'll tell you why it's being applauded.
A "bit" has two decimals, which is in line with existing currency notations. This means that it can be (more) easily integrated into existing bookkeeping systems, receipt generators and so on.

Traditionally, a musician was someone who sang or played an instrument to amuse a live crowd and got compensated with money for spending his or her time. 
The thought that you should be able to perform once, copy the result tons of times and deserve to receive money for every canned copy of your stunt is a relatively modern one. Now, I like your optimism, but don't get mad when it doesn't work.
Out of interest, how much money have services like Grooveshark earned off of your music? How often do you perform in front of a live audience? Do you have a fair share of dedicated fans?
Note that when people share your music, it means that your music is becoming popular. Publicity means becoming able to draw people towards your performances.

A (translated) TL;DR summary of the article:
- BAS Nederland is the very first energy firm in the world to accept Bitcoin for payments.
- Founder Arash Aazami states that Bitcoin adheres to their philosophy of reducing our dependency on old, restricting systems.
- They expect their ideas to resonate with a lot of people who want to break free from 'old world systems' and notice that a lot of people are looking for new solutions that are beneficial to both themselves as well as their surroundings.
BAS is a company that focuses on durable energy and helps people who want to reduce the amount of (fossil) energy they use without requiring them to invest a great amount of money.

I totally agree. I did however manage to buy a Steam gift card using Bitcoin without having to deal with a hefty fee.

I personally would have preferred bits. Two decimals, short and simple.

Because, again, they're not selling your songs. Also, I think they find a fixed monthly price more clear and even more reasonable.


That's like saying your internet provider is selling you other people's websites. Think I'm wrong? Take down the websites. How's their cash flow now?
Should internet providers now pay website creators per website you visit, or was that a pretty bad argument?


Again, it's a protocol. What websites that make money by displaying ads (like "The Pirate Bay" or "Kickass Torrents") offer your torrent to its users? Did they need your permission to do so?
The only reason ads and voluntary donations suffice there is the fact that they don't have to deal with reserving a massive amount of bandwidth per active user.
They offer a service (which is anything but free to maintain) that allows people to find cultural works and get rewarded for it.
Just like Grooveshark.

Well, in my opinion people should consider directly paying for news again. Here's why:
Ad funded news sources depend on funds they get from businesses. This means that these companies gain influence over what we read everyday. Also, the first thing news sources are going to save money on is the team of reporters. 
The result? A lot of news sources with very little original content and almost no means to perform fact checks. 
A few central press agencies make up the content and news outlets mostly copy-paste it onto their front pages. Centralized news, so to speak.

The term milliBit is an alternative one as well. Less confusing is comparing "bits" with the original naming conventions:
* 1 bitcoin = 1.000.000 bits
* 1 millibitcoin = 1.000 bits
* 1 microbitcoin = 1 bit
"Criticism - A milliBit does not follow the SI standard verbatim, so at best this is an ad-hoc naming convention."
Source (Bitcoin wiki):
Ignoring the SI standard is what's causing these problems, not the term "bits". That's why we don't call millimeters millimets or milliliters millilits. Oh well.

That depends on what implementation you use. Wallets like Electrum [use]( a phrase consisting of 12 words to represent a 128-bits random seed.
