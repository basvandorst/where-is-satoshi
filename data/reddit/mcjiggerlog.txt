There was just a block mined with only one transaction in it - 
I presume that's not very common?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:21:04
Totally agree - these kinds of threads are so embarrassing. Sounds like the kind of shit your crazy Aunt would say about her latest multi-level marketing scheme.

I'm trying to send some coins from my ledger nano s to coinbase and I've gone 4 blocks with zero confirmations after having selected High priority.
The transaction has fees of 0.0002 - what gives? Is that still not high enough?
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:48:05
It is exponential. You're looking at a log graph.

Coinbase is probably the easiest, if not the cheapest.

I'm a big fan of bits ($) + satoshis (c). Copay already supports bits if you're looking for a compatible wallet.

I get it's just a joke, but people making comparisons like this is a pet peeve of mine.
1 USD is 110 Yen, but you'd be paid (for the sake of the argument) 110 times as much Yen as USD. What matters is the changing relative purchasing powers of the currency in your bank account.
Fun fact that shows that the number itself doesn't really matter - France revalued the Franc in 1960, making 100 "old" Francs worth 1 "new" francs. People weren't suddenly 100 times poorer.

Sent coins where? I thought no exchanges were accepting BCH deposits yet?
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:27:35
How exactly does that work? Do you have to meet in person? Is it safe?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:58:53
Electron Cash is garbage - I get told "Insufficient funds" when trying to send something *much* smaller than the stated balance on the same damn screen.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:01:35
Shouldn't we pretty much always be looking at long term charts in log scale? Percentage change is what matters.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:30:18
Can we try and update the repo as soon as any exchanges start accepting BCH deposits? You can then watch the repo to get notifications when this happens.

Hitbtc was easy. They only need 2 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:30:35
Let's be honest, it was pretty understandable that that seemed like a terrible idea at the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:49:02
Someone should tell this guy what a percentage is.

Again thanks for tarring my whole city with another giant, thoughtless brush.

Alright that I'll accept.
But still, Spain is a beautiful country and you're missing out on a lot by refusing to go to the rest of Spain.
Try not to get too caught in politics..

We're up 100% since the 2,500 of July, so getting to 10,000 in the next several months really isn't that crazy.

Nope because I don't know what the high or the low would be

The whole scene is really unprofessional
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:36:59
If they want people to take them seriously, yes, they should speak politely and not act like they're in high school.

Thanks for the explanation. Still, I don't think I feel confident enough in how much I understand what I'd be doing to gamble on shorting. I'll stick with the HODL.

I don't get that at all. Do you mind explaining that in a noob friendly way, please? What is BTC_FROZEN2? How can I buy BCC if it doesn't exist yet?
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:52:55
Can someone ELI5? If I have a wallet with copay and there is a hard fork, I will own coins on both of the forks? And if I have coins in coinbase I would only have coins on one of the forks?

This - if you're going to buy, buy before August 1st and you'll get Bitcoin Cash for free. I don't personally believe it has a future but it'll still have a value of &gt; 0
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:16:46
I'm a bit out of the loop, but is there any high-level plan for how to deal with the volatility? Bitcoin's viability as a currency is pretty damn low whilst it is so volatile.
