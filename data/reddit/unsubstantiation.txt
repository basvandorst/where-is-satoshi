I'm not convinced Bitcoin will hold value in a recession, actually I expect the opposite, Ideally I would sell and convert before then. But I'm not confident in any safe store of value for the imminent future (I expect a recession).    
I don't disagree with your child analogy, I believe that for an investment to succeed you should support it directly, vote with your wallet. (unfortunately something we are barely seeing with btc)   
Regarding winter,are you referring to a recession metaphorically? I mean yes there is the issue with cold and batteries, but this isn't their first year, I'm curious why you would expect more significant issues this winter? (I live in the arctic part of the year, never seen a tesla or ev there, but I've heard their working out decently in Norway; Some EVs like Nissan specifically have been shown to average 40% battery capacity loss in ~3 years, but toyota and tesla seem to do well.).  
 I really haven't followed their financials lately, I did a pretty comprehensive analysis a few years back that was extremely negative, and have been kind of disgusted by Elons personality so I haven't checked recently, but maybe I should.

You're hurting bitcoins valuation.  
Saying it should be treated like a ponzi scheme is just going to scare off legitimate investors who know what basic scams look like. 
Hash rate has nothing to do with price, so it shouldn't affect price.
And If it did it would allow people to pump hash, sell btc, stop mining, buy btc. The price of btc would stagnate and eventually start dropping forever because the investment value would be lost.

**Should we build more large dams? The actual costs of hydropower
megaproject development**
" the Three Gorges dam in China is an “environ-
mental bane” that will cost over USD 26.45 billion over the next 10 years in environmental “mitigation efforts”. Despite their outsized
financial and environmental costs, the purported benefits of large
hydropower dams prove uncertain."   
" Three out of every four large dams suffered a cost overrun in
constant local currency terms.
2. Actual costs were on average 96% higher than estimated costs;
the median was 27% (IQR 86%). The evidence is overwhelming
that costs are systematically biased towards underestimation"  
" The typical forecasted benefit-to-cost ratio was 1.4. In other
words, planners expected the net present benefits to exceed
the net present costs by about 40%. Nearly half the dams
suffered a cost overrun ratio of 1.4 or greater breaching this
threshold after which the asset can be considered stranded—i.e.
its upfront sunk costs are unlikely to be recovered."

That's all true, but they have a good way of negotiating with you. They just prosecute you with maximum penalties. Say it moons and you have 5 million in btc. They don't know you have it. But they are gonna lock you up for 20 years unless you give 5 million to them. Is that 5 million in the bank worth 20 years of your life, of you aging? To me it's not. 1-2 years sure.

Misconception there. Renewable does not mean little impact on the environment.   
It means little *recurring* impact on the environment. Renewable energy projects, especially hydro-electric are well known for having very large initial environmental Impacts.  
This is an issue specifically in the Case of BTC, due to it's erratic pricing and the halving in that It's energy demands could drop completely. This has the effect that if the renewable energy infrastructures operations costs are too high than the infrastructure might not outlive it's initial environmental cost. This has been a problem in the past, even before BTC. BTC's involvement amplifies the risk of energy infrastructure investment.

Sure it does, the hash pool only has to be around 1% to be extremely profitable doing this. The biggest hash pool is 15%. There's no loss in mining opportunity either... A difficulty algorithm attack was done successfully just last week... The volatility is what causes the profitability for them, but hurts bitcoin...   
"A Ponzi scheme is about fooling late investors" Bitcoin 11 years after it's creation after the price has peaked and stagnated.  
"non-existent company" Bitcoin isn't a company.  
" sales rather than the funds of early investors" Bitcoin profits are from funds of early investors not sales.  
"the only Ponzi schemes in Bitcoin are those who treat it like an investment" you are treating it like an investment  "If everyone sticks to this pricing formula, Bitcoin will explode in value"  
"All this speculative day-trading is why the price is so volatile and volatility is what's making adoption difficult" True, but hodl is also.  
"stabilize the price" Your idea wouldn't stabilize the price, affecting hash is easy for big fish. Just look at the charts and see how volatile hash has been, it's at half of what it used to be.

"I'm a bit worried about even attempting to spread my purchases over a week or two given there may be a big movement in either direction."  
This is precisely why you spread your purchases over a week or two. You should study up on investing before making a big purchase on a very high risk investment. Cost averaging the investment is not greedy, it's smart, it reduces gains and losses. If you've been keeping track of BTC recently you would see that you should be cost averaging over months, not weeks. BTC has been jumping up and down by ~30% and then stagnating for months at a time. Cost averaging over weeks may not protect you.   
Invest slowly so that you learn about BTC as you go on. Going all in works for a lucky few and screws most other people out of their savings, don't assume you won't make the same mistakes other people do.
@_date: 2019-11-17 09:57:07
No, 51% attacks will always be viable. The belief is that no attacks will happen because they would only hurt the value of Bitcoin and unlikely to profit. But if that was the intention of the attack it would be successful.

No, for a few reasons.   
The rules apply to all crypto not just btc.  
You won't be able to cash out without kyc, and even you do you're still legally on the hook for the taxes, they can find out years later and still come after you. International sales still apply.

Tesla is a super bad investment to me, because in a recession luxury goods are poised to fail.   
And housing/land doesn't matter if it goes down, because it's the type of investment you hold for decades, it will come up again, and higher due to inflation. (This only holds for quality housing that does not devalue quickly, aka not condos or McMansions).

Because you are these people. What you've been doing is working so far, but it doesn't work in every situation and if you always use this method you are guaranteed to eventually lose a lot.  
What will you do if the price keeps dropping? will you keep buying in? what if your investment loses all it's value? At what point will you exit the market. Not having an exit just means you can lose everything instead of just losing some.  
The value doesn't even have to decrease for you to lose money, if it stabilized too much you could lose money (If it's a perfect store of value then there's no investment potential, index funds would be better).
Have you tried writing down your system, and putting it through theoretical and historical tests?  
It's not too hard to buy low sell high while btc seems to be accumulating in growth or fluctuating with stability, but you are more fucked then people who sell early if bitcoin starts to stabilize at a significantly lower value. Maybe that $3000 from earlier this year is a more correct valuation.

If the global economy collapses, or some sort of real war with china it could cause the USD and most currencies to drop in value. If the USD loses 80% of it's value then Bitcoin would be worth ~5x the current value. The USD loss of value is inevitable, historically it has happened to every currency that has ever existed. But the question is when, will we see BTC at 50k USD soon? Definitely not. Will we see it at greater than 50k USD in a thousand years, almost certainly. 100 years, maybe... It really depends on international politics. And keep in mind, even if BTC's USD value increases, it does not guarantee more spending power. For example, A car that costs 10k now, would be worth 50k then, in both cases it may still be worth the same amount of bitcoin. I think it's unlikely we will see Bitcoin stabilize for more than a week at greater than 18k in the next several years. Frankly the people who say it will go to the moon are insane.
