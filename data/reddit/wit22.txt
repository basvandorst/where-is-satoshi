The burn period was the initial period were you could destroy bitcoins and receive XCP. It lasted a full month and has ended.
If you want to buy some XCP, visit

Another insensitive asshole HODLER. Thanks. Because 250,000 worthless assholes wasn't enough yet.

I agree completely OP. Counterparty has massive potential.
I am invested long-term in this one. It was launched in the same spirit was bitcoin first way; open-source and decentralized.
It enables more functionality and utility while leveraging the bitcoin infrastructure that is already there.
The amount of electricity be used to secure the bitcoin network also acts to secure the counterparty network; except with counterparty you can have trustless and decentralised betting and stock exchanges, all built on top of the bitcoin network.

So you're saying my theories and opinions are worthless because I trusted the oldest bitcoin exchange which should have been insanely profitable wouldn't lose 99.9% of it's funds.
Well I guess that's your opinion.

Whoa. Thanks mate.
That is actually my first tip ever!

I literally installed counterpartyd today.
It feels like the future. 
The counterparty or the intermediary or the guy in the middle will become neutral, open-source code which charges almost nothing compared to what we pay now for similar services.
Instead of betfair taking 2-5% or escrows taking 0-2% or anyone taking a cut; both parties save.
The financial industry is going to be de-intermediated; and everyone else is going to profit.
It's a brave new world.

One "shibe" comments
"See it this way. Dogecoin has the chance to be first on Facebook. If another currency manages to take Facebook because Dogecoin neglected it then that currency will rapidly win in utility and become a threat to dogecoin."
Yes dogecoin is a litecoin clone. But this doesn't mean that it has no value. Their differentiation is based on marketing and community/culture.
They are literally outmarketing bitcoin with viral marketing techniques.

A global, trustless reputation system will be needed.

So strange. 
I literally just opened a ticket within my bitstamp account and posted this.
"To whom it may concern,
I love your exchange and service; I have been very impressed with the quality of your service as you've scaled; especially in comparison to mtgox.
I welcome the change you recently made to needing 2FA for withdrawals.
However, with the mtgox failure, the increasing phishing and hacking attempts and the increased threat of regulation from the governments of the world, I am very scared and paranoid.
Please continue to increase the security of your exchange and take steps to prove mathematically and undeniably in a trustless manner, that you maintain all customer btc and fiat reserves on hand, at all times.
A suggestion; you must add more and more security features; it was only yesterday when I read someone had their bitstamp account hacked for 24 btc. Even though it was probably his fault, I don't want it to happen to me from a single mistake.
Can you offer a second 2FA device option: as in, to withdraw btc, I need access to TWO 6 digit codes on TWO separate devices. You could create and build your own bitstamp 2FA device. Or you could create some sort of 3FA device for premium account holders, that you give for free; as a promotion. 3FA or a second 2FA option in addition to your current 2FA.
Another feature: The ability to lock addresses or whitelist certain addresses by the client; and require 24hours -48 hours and 2FA to change these whitelist addresses.
I want you to prove that you have excellent and safe cold storage methods; you could do this by bring someone like Andreas Antonopolous as an independent auditor of your procedures.
Please do these things or I will be forced to move some of my business elsewhere in order to spread my risk because I live in fear of having my bitcoins stolen or having governments freeze your UK/Slovenian bank accounts.
Keep up the good work. You are in a trusted and enviable market position. Do not fuck it up like mt gox. I lost 50 btc due to mtgox.
Warm regards,
I support this post and open letter 100%. I came to reddit to post what I had written to my bitstamp and I found your letter had been written independently to mine.

The following features are implemented and (mostly) working:
    Send: XCP or user-created assets
    User-Created Assets: Issue user‐defined currencies/assets and pay dividends on them.
    Distributed Exchange: Trade XCP, BTC or any asset with any other.
    Feeds: Broadcast information, which may be used as the subject of a bet.
    Betting, Financial Derivatives: Make bets, or construct contracts for difference, on the numerical value of a feed.
This is the first open-source, decentralized project that was initialized by proof-of-burn (destroying bitcoins by sending them to an invalid address) that intends to layer advanced functionality over the top of the Bitcoin Protocol.
The counterparty team is very active on the bitcointalk forums. The project was launched about a month ago and has seen very rapid progress with the launch of their functioning decentralized exchange. 
I believe someone has already used Counterparty protocol to make relatively trustless, decentralised bets on the superbowl a few days ago.
A more streamlined GUI client for counterparty is due to be released soon.

Requiring no trust in a central point, I suppose.
Everyone links into this reputation ledger (you can see a person's reputation and history and it links in with twitter, facebook, linkedin, ebay, credit checks...). To trust someone who has a reputation on this global distributed ledger is almost trust-free, since the information/reputation is too costly to fake.

You're invested in doge?
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:28:14
This is related.
Check the Counterparty Protocol; it's an open-source, decentralised project for the "the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments using Bitcoin as a transport layer"
They have an operating dex or decentralised exchange that's of alpha quality in terms of code.

Same thing for me...for 12 hours.
I've opened support tickets, messaged their facebook page, and I've emailed them.
"YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW BITCOINS AT THE MOMENT."
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:33:08
Hey OP.
I can see that eventually happening.
Check out Flattr (micro donations through social media) - although twitter just blocked access to their api...so they can't go through them any more
