Now imagine the profits to be had making it a wallet. And loading it with 1 Satoshi. eBay would eat that shit up if you could find a good printer who made it look and feel like dollars

"Analyst's" need to do some fucking research into the paper gold market if they think bitcoin is responsible for the price fuckery which has been going on for years.

Gold weighs a ton, it's why they move it around on little carts, either the venuezualans are very poor or this is fake news. Whole life savings, I highly doubt it
