In other words, fuck Blockchain.  Lol.  Thanks!

That's awesome, man!
I'm going to give that book a read.  I just found it on my Nook.  The fact that you could transfer so quickly and not worry about fees is outstanding.

I'm in California.  Central Valley to be more specific and we don't really have any places that are using Bitcoin yet.  Though if I wanted to take a 3 hour drive, North or South, I could find a bunch of places that do.  Plus, Bitcoin ATMs!

This probably went right over my head, but is Blockchain popular for posting random shit on here?  Or am I missing something?  Lol.

Hmm, I'll give this a try right now.

Just sent it to you guys.  I think I did it right.  I went through the app, which redirected me to Gmail.
EDIT:  I just got it.  You guys are awesome!

Someone just tipped me using ChangeTip (Which was awesome, by the way) and I transferred it over to Mycelium.  This is nifty as fuck.

I'm really liking this wallet.  I'm not too familar with how security works with all these wallets as of yet, but I do like this interface and the fact it has a username/password that works on different devices.
I might have found a winner here.

Yeah, mining seems way to over my head.  I figure this is like a small investment, plus its fun to use and the community looks great.
@_date: 2015-03-25 06:24:20
I'll install that right now.  Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-25 06:25:55
Yeah, I'm kinda hoping to be ahead of the curve.

Thanks, man.  I'll send a small amount to my account and when it goes through, I'll leave some feedback.  Thanks for the videos too.

Just added them to my Watch Later list.  Thanks for the recommendation!  :D

You just popped my Bitcoin cherry!  Thank you so much!

I ended up sending it to my Mycelium wallet using the QR scanner, which was really neat.  I'm testing out a lot of different wallets.  Airbitz was just recommended to me and I'm digging that one.

I like your use of the ever rare semicolon.  Skeptics of the banking system and national currency in general?  My faith in the American economy has been shaken over the last decade.
