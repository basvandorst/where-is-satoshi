from a computer science standpoint, how does bitcoin work? This is what I am trying to teach to them. The original whitepaper will probably do.

HA, you are too funny!

If you know it's going to go up, shouldn't you be buying all the coin you can instead of asking reddit?

much appreciated, I'm leaning on ethics toward bitcoin due to the nature of the class.

The presentation was done in 2 parts, by 2 people. I'm pretty sure my partner only threw it in to have people recognize it. Buzz words.

To get the facts straight, I'm talking about the protocol. I want to teach them how bitcoin works.
