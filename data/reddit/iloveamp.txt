I want whatever OP is having

Is there any incentive to generate blocks after the bitcoin reward becomes insignificant?
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:10:53
If it is unused, then who cares?
@_date: 2011-06-26 05:58:52
I don't see what's so hard about these processes, they're pretty safe too unless you are being stupid.

I'll gladly buy your bitcoins right now. What's your asking price? I'll buy at $12 a pop.
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:43:39
I don't even care anymore. I'm staying for better or worse.

I came up with a new advice pic.

Price stable for a few days
Price plateau

That's some straight zen. Thanks!

What a lucky duck. Can you give me one for starting the thread and my upvote :D:D:D:D:D??? /futilebeggingattempt

Saying the three bitcoins I bought a month ago are worth three bicoins today isn't very descriptive.
Just think of dollars as the commodity. I stated how much mine are worth in dollars.
Perhaps you'd like to measure how valuable your bitcoins are in 8Gb iPods?

Unless my Dropbox account and USB drive fail, nothing.

I found my new ticker. Thanks!

My wallet is already encrypted and backed up in multiple places and I predict that bitcoins will grow in value.
There's really no need for a bank unless I want to get a bitcoin loan, which I don't.

How sweet of him.

Wow, fuck this place. Where's a better exchange?
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:59:09
Because a bitcoin is just as valuable when it can be used to buy a house as it is when it can only be used to buy a hotdog.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:47:48
I feel regret just reading your post. Make sure your backup is encrypted and in the cloud
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:54:55
Probably not a bad idea to diversify a bit though.

You gotta be sure to update regularly. Multiple times I've installed Arch and didn't update for a couple of months, next time I tried my desktop manager and multiple other components were broken and since I had made so many updates I didn't bother trying to isolate the root of the problem.
Shit's hardcore.

The only place where investments don't periodically decrease in value is La La Land. Name me a stock, commodity or anything whose value has only risen (monotonically increased if you are mathematically inclined) over its lifetime.
The only questions there are about a bitcoin crash are:
When will it crash?
How much less will a bitcoin be worth after the crash?
Will the crash leave the price of a bitcoin under its present price?

Sell! Then buy at a lower price. Y'all dumb.

Something I can buy easily with bitcoins that I can not buy easily with dollars.
Something that is cheaper in bitcoins than it is in dollars.
Any suggestions? Besides drugs and other illicit Silk road type goods I haven't found any potential reason to spend my bitcoins yet.

Prices holding steady at $140 for one day is "stable"

Bubbles can inflate for more than a few quarters. Some take years to pop.
