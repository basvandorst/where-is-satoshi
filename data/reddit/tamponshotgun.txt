Guide to securing your money in a bank:
1) don't provide your information to anyone but your bank, if you did provide your information to anyone else, contact your bank and they will refund any fraudulent charges if you inform them in a timely manner (60 days usually). Your money is guaranteed. 
2) Secure your account info by not losing your checks, account number or debit card. If you have lost any of these or they are compromised by hackers, inform your bank and they will give you all that money back
3) Don't send wires to people you don't know, otherwise your money may be unrecoverable (just like Bitcoin)
That's it. Three steps to secure your money and two of them are guaranteed to give you the money back if it's stolen. This is why Bitcoin won't replace fiat.

Let me introduce you to [Zeek Rewards]( one of the largest Ponzi schemes in US history. It too, promised insane returns and people were reporting that (on paper) they were making returns of 50-75%. I personally talked to someone who sent his life savings (around 50k total I think) to Zeek, because he "made" 25% back on his initial investment of (I think 5kish) in an insanely short period of time (I think a month). He tried to get me in on it, saying "oh it's not a get rich quick scheme, it's a legitimate investment".
Measuring an "investment" solely by "which one gives me insane returns" is not a good way to determine if an investment is a good idea or not. Simply having bigger percentage returns on investment does not mean it's a good investment. Ask the approximately 9000 Zeek Rewards members who "made money" on this Ponzi scheme versus the millions who lost their entire life savings.

I'm super confused what you are talking about it makes zero sense. I was simply stating that free bank accounts exist and I can find 20+ banks and credit unions in my area that offer free accounts.

Aww thanks for supporting my argument that banks are better than Bitcoin! :D I love all the freebies I get with fiat currency and you do too!

Lmao so I should buy Bitcoin if I have a starving family member in a prohibited country who needs money. I don't. And how many people do you know of in Venezuela who need cash? Give me a break ��
Back on topic: banks guarantee your funds against loss due to fraud or theft. Bitcoin offers no such guarantee. If you lost your private key: lmao too bad sfyl learn to etch steel with it next time to prevent your paper note from being accidentally shredded. Bitcoin can be lost under any number of scenarios: lost private key, lost/stolen/destroyed offline wallet, malware installed on your computer, hacks of exchanges, etc. The only ways to irretrievably lose fiat currency is 1) carry cash and lose/have it stolen (which is why I only carry about $40 in cash max) or 2) be so dumb as to send a wire to a Nigerian prince. Everything else is covered and you can get your money back if it's stolen from you. 
But yeah sure, everyone will just adopt and start using Bitcoin instead of fiat. Sure buddy.

If a government issues a ruling that says that stealing cars is now not illegal, does that mean that the concept of owning cars is stupid or does it mean the government is stupid?
Same thing here. A collapsing, incompetent and insolvent government drowning in debt and bad political decisions issued a bad ruling regarding banking. This doesn't automatically make banking bad, especially since in every other country on the continent, it's business as usual with no hiccups. 
You are using a single example from a collapsing government to try and prove your ideological point that you believe all of banking is bad. This is *the very definition* of a hasty generalization logical fallacy.

Because you don't understand that a fiat currency can't have an intrinsic value. A decentralized computer file with no employees or capital has no intrinsic value any more than an Excel file on my computer does. Sure, the data itself may have value to someone but that's not intrinsic value. Basically, you don't even remotely understand what intrinsic value means. You seem to think it means "if something has value to someone" but that's not what it is.

That's not what intrinsic value is. Gold, for instance has intrinsic value because outside of it's value as an investment, it can be worn as jewelry, used in manufacturing, etc. 
Bitcoin is a currency just like fiat. It is also a fiat currency because just like fiat, it's value is not tied to any other use other than currency. Therefore, Bitcoin only has a value because people say it has value, making it identical to fiat in that respect.

Oh give me a break. Entering your SSN online in 1994 is a far cry from accidentally typoing a Bitcoin address or having your computer hacked and your private key stolen. This is just silly. There are an absolutely staggering number of ways I can be robbed or lose significant sums for small security mistakes. To have my identity stolen in 1994 I need to go to a website and type all that crap in, but if I'm that dumb I will also type my private key into a phishing website. Don't try to deflect and ignore the danger of cryptocurrency by comparing it to an idiot typing his SSN into a BBS board. 
I love how your entire post boils down to "yeah, so you can lose everything if you don't follow my huge security refresher, but people will want it one day!" People like security. We have had banks for literally thousands of years. We need someone to watch our money for us so we don't have to "be our own bank" and constantly have the threat of being bankrupted or losing my cold wallet and losing every penny I have. 
People want to be able to sleep soundly at night and Bitcoin doesn't allow that. I challenge you to count the number of threads you see in the different Bitcoin subreddits and see how many users have been hacked. I saw one where a guy lost a bunch of cryptocurrency because his dog chewed up his trezor and utterly destroyed it beyond recovery. Granted, the dog can chew you my wallet with the $21 in cash in it, but losing my debit card and $21 isn't a big deal. If I had significant savings on a trezor and I accidentally wash it, oh well I just lost $5,000. If I wash my cash or debit card, who cares?
This is why Bitcoin is so hilarious and you summarized it here:


So, I can use fiat debit/credit cards, which is guaranteed against theft or loss, or I can use Bitcoin, which isn't guaranteed at all. I choose Bitcoin because I love knowing I can drop my trezor and lose all the money stored in it! It's just so exciting!
Or, I could be a complete and total moron about security and never lose a dime if I use fiat. Which one do you think most people will prefer?

Smuggling currency into the country physically or using shell corporations and accounts to launder cash through multiple channels to try and evade OFAC requirements but it requires an excessive amount of work and there are multiple safeguards designed to catch and punish you. If I want to send money to ISIS with Bitcoin I just need to copy and paste their wallet address. It's far simplier to fund terrorism with Bitcoin.

False. Most banks/CUs will offer you an overpayment service where they will pay your merchant even though you don't have enough money (for the price of an NSF fee usually). Or, you could not be a goddamn moron and check your balance prior to paying a bill, or just pay with a credit card when you don't have enough to pay for your bill. 


Yeah, if you don't have enough to pay a bill you don't pay your bill. Say hello to more fees and penalties from your merchants. I talked to a guy once who told me that his workplace insurance is so hardcore that if he misses one premium payment for NSF, they turn off his health insurance. If you didn't have enough money to pay for your health insurance with cryptocurrency, then hey, no more health insurance until next year! Obviously a superior payment method right?


Lmao you have a shit bank then. My bank debit card limit is $400 at the ATM, $1500 debit and $3000 credit. Your bank is absolute shit if they are only $500 lmao. 


PFFFFFTHAHAHAHAHA! This is laughably wrong or again, you have an intensely shit bank. Federal reporting requirements are $10,000.01 (cash only) and more. If your bank is quizzing you about $1,500 deposits, then you have a REALLY insanely shit bank. 


Come to cryptocurrency where you can evade federal currency reporting requirements that are put into place as anti money-laundering and terrorism financing limits. Most people will never see these limits as they are $10,000.01 in cash and more. How many people do you think are going to have $10,000.01 to deposit in cash unless they're doing something illegal or very very stupid? Sure, you *can* buy a car for $15,000 in cash, but why would you when you can get a free cashier's check for the same amount, which is replaceable if it is lost or stolen?

Might want to Google "do banks cause inflation". Banks can cause a form of inflation but the type of inflation that sinks economies and causes widespread problems is caused by government overspending. Hyperinflation kills countries quickly. Slower, but out of control inflation still causes enormous problems though (see Venezuela). The banks didn't sink Venezuela, the government did.

You ever played local banking? First you give me the ball. And then I don't charge you to play with that ball. If you want to give that ball to someone else, I do that for free. I don't charge you anything to hold onto your ball. If you want to give your ball to someone else across the world, I charge a moderate fee to do so, but how many times are you realistically going to be sending your ball to the other side of the world?
Local bank/credit union: free checking, no strings attached, free bill pay, no monthly fee, $10 domestic wire, $20 international wire. But yeah, keep saying all of banking is evil because you've never heard of a free checking account. Also, how many of you actually need to send wires on a regular basis? 99% of banking for 99% of consumers is free debit withdraws, free ACH and free bill payment services. I've only sent one wire in my life and that was to purchase my house and it was sent for me by my bank for free because I was financing my mortgage through them.

Spending a lot of time studying something doesn't legitimize that something. If I spend 5 years studying chakras and body energy fields, then a doctor tells me that there is no medical evidence to support chakras it doesn't mean the doctor is wrong just because I studied my thing more and he studied it less. This is an argument from authority fallacy: you believe one side is right just because they say they've studied this thing more.
"Oh but don't you trust people who are experts in their field? Isn't that an argument from authority fallacy too?"
No, because if you have a degree in medicine it means you are certified by a non-biased third party as an expert. If I spend all my time reading self-help books that doesn't make me a therapist any more than "studying cryptocurrencies" for five years makes me an investment advisor whom people should trust for investment advice.

That's not how inflation works. The type of inflation that destroys economies like Germany in 1922, Zimbabwe during their hyperinflation crisis and Venezuela now is due to the government being insolvent because their spending exceeds their GDP. This is most noticeable in Zimbabwe, where when the government wanted to spend money (for instance build a hospital), they didn't raise income to do it, they simply printed more money and gave that to the construction workers. This eventually caught up with them when the country's debtors came to collect their bill and found no GDP to pay them. 
Banks don't cause this. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 04:45:47
Ok, let's: you are prohibited from sending money to Venezuela because of all the political problems, corruption and rampant crime in the country. You can successfully circumvent this by using Bitcoin.
You can also circumvent these same OFAC controls and send Bitcoin [directly to ISIS]( or North Korea too though so I'm not sure what your point is and I'm not sure that being able to circumvent terrorism financing and money laundering laws is a good trade off to be able to send money to a relative in Venezuela.
Terrorists just [love Bitcoin.](
I'm sure that was probably what you didn't want to acknowledge.

I may say that I just want to send a birthday gift to my cousin living in Syria, then my "cousin" withdraws the cash and hands it to the government for creation of chemical weapons to use on civilians. 
C'mon man you can't be this ignorant. Do you seriously not know where terrorists live and how the country is fraught with corruption from top to bottom? Saudi Arabia recently did a corruption sweep and found BILLIONS in embezzled funds. And that's why you can't send money to Saudi Arabia.

Lmao you just reinforced my argument. You think you need to do business with a brick and mortar bank when online banks exist that don't put you through all that shit and still offer free checking with interest even. When I moved across the country I was even using my credit union account from over 1,000 miles away. I received direct deposit so I never needed to go into a branch in years. My account was completely, 100% free. 
"Workaround is a credit card"? Why don't you have a credit card? It's an essential stop-gap for all financially stable adults, costs nothing to use and even pays your rewards. I have just redeemed $100 worth of free Amazon credit because I use my credit card to pay my bills then pay my credit card in full with my checking account. I don't pay a dime for it and they give me free Amazon credit.
Everything about your story is hilarious. You have a shit bank, with a shit mobile deposit program (mine is $1500 per day lmao and I can also deposit into an ATM) and you don't even remotely understand how banking works and yet you want to say it's waaay worse than cryptocurrency. The fact of the matter is that fiat has worked for thousands of years and our current banking system is working marvelously for hundreds of millions of people. I get paid $10 a month cash back for using my debit card, about $50 a month for using my credit card, pay zero fees for both and haven't paid an NSF or bank fee in over 20 years. 
You, on the other hand, think cryptocurrency is your savior because you use bank of America (the worst bank in the US). ��


I'm so hurt. I'm just gonna cry into my free Amazon shipment coming tomorrow that wouldn't have been possible without fiat currency.

You think the problems at this one bank are indictive of fiat banking as a whole, right?
I was pointing out that outright scams are happening every day in cryptocurrency and pointed to a scam that is happening right at this moment. 
Meanwhile, this bank is having trouble not because they are fiat, but because their IT team fucked up a system upgrade. No other bank is suffering as badly on the entire continent and even though TSB customers are very unhappy right now, all of their funds are guaranteed back to them. 
Meanwhile, all those users of BCN are gonna lose everything when the scam completes.
Your post is like showing a picture of a flat tire and claiming that all automobiles are trash. 
[Edit] for those downvoting without replying, can you elaborate what is causing TSB's problems? The actual article says that their IT department basically royally fucked up. It had zero to do with banking or fiat currency in general because all other banks in the world are not experiencing similar issues.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:55:07
I very much doubt it. Notice that every other bank in the world is not having these issues. Other banks learn from the mistakes of others. If TSB had such horrible problems, you had better bet the other banks will avoid those pitfalls. My bank has gone through two upgrades since I've been with them and the most I was impacted was my mobile app didn't work for a couple of days. Online banking bill worked though and worked flawlessly. 
So keep on betting that the entire banking industry will collapse. Banks have existed for thousands of years and until Bitcoin offers something better or even the same services as banks, it will never overtake banks. For example, if I want to pay my mortgage in cryptocurrency I need to pay 2-3% more for my payment through a third party cryptocurrency bill payment processor. If I pay with my bank bill payment service it's completely, 100% free. Why would I adopt cryptocurrency as my main currency if I have to immediately pay 2-3% more?

I work in a bank so I get to see all the ridiculous things people think makes their money secure. I once helped an old lady reset her debit card PIN number twice in two days because she forgot it. She also didn't know her account number. She had lost over 10 debit cards in two years. Do you think her private key will be either memorized or saved somewhere safe that she can remember? I still get people who tell me they write their PIN on the back of their debit card. If these people lose their debit card, they can just cancel it and prevent any loss to their account. If they lose their private key, their money can be emptied in seconds and is completely unrecoverable. Do you think that lady who forgot her PIN is going to read this entire post you just made? Do you think she is going to remember it more than ten seconds after she reads it?
Bitcoin may be ok for some people to use who take security seriously, but the great majority of people using bank accounts today are insanely careless with their information and will lose everything almost instantly if they switched to cryptocurrency. 
This means a huge influx of new homeless people now on government benefits or just simply on the street. Is a 20-30% increase in homeless good for the country just because they lost their money in a reckless way?

So being skeptical of someone who declares themselves an expert in an emerging technology field is a bad thing? If I told you "I am an expert in cold fusion, you should invest in my startup" I think you should be aware that simply calling myself an expert doesn't mean I know what I'm doing and "studying [x] for [y] years" doesn't automatically make me an expert in it, nor does it mean I am a trusted authority for investments. This is why I stated that both of them are just using their personal opinions. Neither should be trusted blindly. 
It's the foundation of how to protect yourself against scams: don't give money to someone just because they say they're smart. Do your own research and find out whether that thing is in your best interest. I recently did this with a solar salesman. He presented a temping offer to basically give me some solar panels for free then I read his contract and found out that it has tons of liability waivers and protections for his company and almost none for me as the consumer, so I rejected his offer. 
If people would do the same for Bitcoin, they would discover how many ways you can lose significant amounts of money, such as simply losing your private key. People lose things all the time, and if your life savings was on that wallet then hey you're now bankrupt. Congrats, this is the future: lose one password and lose every penny associated with that password.

OP obviously thinks this problem is indicitive of banking in general. There's even another user who commented as such in this thread that he believes the problems at TSB are showing the problems of banking. 
This news article has absolute nothing to do with cryptocurrency at all. It's an IT fuckup. Yet it has 123 upvotes.

You dodged the question. You guys want mass adoption of cryptocurrency correct? This means you want mass numbers of people to use it. In order to get any large number of people to switch from one thing to another, they need a valid reason and to see the benefits of switching, because, let's face it: setting up a bitcoin wallet is an absurd amount of work rather than opening a checking account (which can be opened in about 20 minutes and requires only an initial deposit and a picture ID).
What tangible, everyday-use benefit or reward does cryptocurrency give over fiat money? Is there a cash back incentive? Is my money secured better against fraud? If I'm at the mall, and I'm ready to pay for my $20 item and the store accepts Bitcoin, what benefit is it to me as a consumer to start my Bitcoin app rather than just hand a $20 bill to the merchant?

So, fractal (lmao) reserve banking allows banks to reinburse you for fraud on your debit card. 
This is so painfully ignorant. First, it's "fractional reserve banking" not "fractal". Second, fractional reserve defines the method in which banks loan money and are not required to have a 1:1 ratio of cash on hand for every dollar they loan (super simple explanation, but if you want more, go Google it).
It has ZERO to do with how you bank reinburses you for fraud on your debit card. This comes from the card carrier like Visa. The bank will reimburse you the fraud out of their pocket (provisional credit) and then Visa will reinburse the bank. 
Fractal reserve. Lmao you people.

Lmao yeah right. You said you can't even deposit $1500 into your account without getting quizzed. This is because that kind of transaction is unusual for you and/or you don't have a good relationship with your bank. I just deposited a $2000 check into my account and got no quiz because my account has been open for over a decade, I have compensating funds to cover any check returns and I have two loans with them. If you don't have enough money to cover a check being deposited, your bank is going to look into holding your funds and quizzing you on the source of them because as you probably are not aware, a check is just a fancy IOU until it clears the federal reserve which takes up to 10 business days. If it was cash you were being quizzed on that's even worse because it means that's far outside of normal activity for you and so they suspect you of money laundering.

How will they be solved? I had another bitcoiner tell me that fraud prevention may come to Bitcoin, but who will pay if my Bitcoin is stolen? There's no interchange income to pay for it. The idea is laughable and if Bitcoin starts having some kind of "Bitcoin insurance" against fraud then it eliminates part of the reason people want Bitcoin in the first place: no interchange fees and no charge backs. 
The entire idea of Bitcoin having fraud and scam prevention is hilarious. Bitcoin was designed from it's core to be irreversible and all transactions final. Adding fraud/scam protection or reinbursement would defeat the designed purpose of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a currency correct? Fiat is a currency correct? If you wanted to level the playing field, a debit/credit card is a vehicle in which fiat can be dispensed.

I lose my debit card, no big deal. I can turn it off in seconds via my mobile app. If any money is stolen I can dispute it and get it back. 
If my trezor is lost...lmao SFYL. Sure the guy who stole it can't get my Bitcoin but that Bitcoin is lost to me permanently as well.

You are declaring the 1 bank to be indictive of the entire banking industry when their failure had zero to do with the type of currency they are using and more to do with plain, utter incompetence of their IT team. 
This is what is known as a "hasty generalization" logical fallacy. It's the same one that bigots use to declare all minorities "lazy and violent" because they once knew a black guy who stole their car: "therefore all minorities are car thieves!" This is invalid logic.

Example so you can see what I'm saying: If I say "BCN is currently running an exit scam at this very moment, therefore all of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin is just a massive scam", can you tell me what is wrong with that statement?
Probably not, so let me describe for you. I am taking one thing that is a scam (BCN) and another thing not a scam (bitcoin/cryptocurrency) and saying all are scams without providing proof that Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is a scam. I only have evidence that BCN is a scam. Therefore, my statement of "Bitcoin is a scam because BCN is a scam" is invalid due to being a hasty generalization fallacy. 
Another example: KKK member says "all minorities are thieves because a black guy stole my car once". He only has evidence that a single minority is a car thief, but is stating all minorities everywhere are theives based on his single example. This is also a hasty generalization fallacy and completely invalid logic (and he should be kicked in the nuts for saying it).

Gold can be hidden. Bitcoin can be hidden. Let's say the government outlaws ownership of Bitcoin tomorrow. You can't legally use it in a store and if you use it online you risk having that purchase discovered and your Bitcoin taken. 
Let's say the government outlawed ownership of gold again. You can't use it in a store, you can't risk using it to purchase things online because you risk the purchase being discovered.
How is it different? It would be very easy for the government to track usage of Bitcoin on websites that accept it, just look for a "pay with Bitcoin" section of the site. So your last use is sending it wallet to wallet. So you can transfer your wealth around but not use it for goods and services. What use is it then?

Besides, let me present a little question to show you why this "insurance" is meaningless: is coinbase required by law to reinburse it's customers if they decide to steal all the money in the exchange? If an employee decides to steal your Bitcoin, how do you prove that it was a coinbase employee?

Asset bubble =/= inflation. Economies break down for multiple reasons and inflation is not solely controlled by banks.

BCN just froze the withdraws of all it's customers. Is currently running an exit scam.

And BCN users are not guaranteed anything. Sfyl guys. 
What's your point here...?
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:52:17
Exactly. The intrinsic value of a company is not just that their stock costs money. If the company's stock went to $0, you could still extract money for the shares via selling or operating their equipment or product. Bitcoin has no such value. If Bitcoin stops being valuable tomorrow and drops to $0, there is nothing else of value to extract from Bitcoin if it is not used as a currency or speculative investment. 
This is why Bitcoin is a fiat currency. A gold coin for instance has both fiat value and intrinsic value for melting it down and using it in other applications. Bitcoin cannot be used for anything other than currency/speculation.

How likely do you think it is that a merchant will put this much work into a payment method that probably less than 1% of the overall population will use? Also, how does this same merchant handle returns? Do they refund in an equitable amount of Bitcoin or equitable amount of fiat? The only way I figured out to do something like this is to restrict all Bitcoin returns into equitable amounts of fiat cash only that is time-stamped to the original purchase exact time. 
However now you've opened up a whole new area of money laundering since if I made a bunch of Bitcoin with drugs then I can safely launder it via a return process with a local electronics business and they are none the wiser.

That doesn't even remotely answer my question. Are you confused about what I asked? I asked you:


But you don't seem to understand that just calling someone a name doesn't make your insult true, and you seem to struggle with understanding the question "what is wrong with my post". If you can't describe what's wrong with it, then that means you either 1) don't understand the concepts in talking about (likely) or 2) understand them and you're angry that I exposed the flaws in your own thinking (slightly likely but I doubt it since you don't understand basic logic so you probably don't understand that NPR link I sent you since it's above a third grade reading level).

It also doesn't mean it's a good currency until it can prove itself like one. Not even bitcoiners believe that you should use Bitcoin as a currency and that's telling. Besides it makes sense: if Bitcoin doubled in price in the last month, why would you use it for anything other than money farming for actual *usable* currency like fiat?
Sure, there's a possibility that this is the next fiat. There's also the possibility this will be classed as another wildcat currency and thrown in the dustbin of history, so declaring it better than fiat when it hasn't even been used like fiat is incredibly premature.

Reduced interchange fees mean nothing if your customers don't want to use that currency and still want to use fiat.

I am. If I commute to work, I am using a set amount of gas and a set amount of energy per day depending on whether I am the only occupant of an office or not, which I normally am not. Therefore, those lights would be on regardless of whether I worked for my bank or not since the existence of this bank building has gone back 40 years. If I were cryptocurrency mining my individual carbon footprint skyrockets because now I'm using a shit ton of electricity that I wouldn't be using otherwise. I may cut down on my gas bill, but I doubt it because I'd still need to commute for things like food. Same with any bank worker.

You've never met a five year old have you? They don't understand the concept of electronic money at all because they don't have planning skills or even multiplication skills yet. Example: [8 year old boy spends $450 on Clash if Clans](
And this is not the worst one. Some kids spent thousands of dollars on electronic garbage because it didn't stop them. 
Physical paper and metal coin is a physical item that can be given and taken away. "I give you a quarter for a candy that costs five cents and I get twenty cents back. Let's count them using pennies!" Since it's physical, you can also teach children about saving: "if you save up fifty cents you can get the big candy instead of the smaller candies or lots of smaller candies!" You can teach that money has value by giving it to the cashier and explaining to your kids that money buys items.

Not even close. Can a $100 bill buy the same amount of stuff today that it could buy 50 years ago? Haha of course not. Is $100 worth of gold bought in 1950 worth the same amount today? Haha of course not. So why would you spend that $100 in gold on something like food or rent when you instead can simply hold onto the gold because you know it's appreciating in value? It makes much more sense to spend the inflationary currency (the $100 bill) than to spend a deflationary currency (like $100 worth of gold). This is simple economics. People don't spend things that are worth more tomorrow. They spend things that are worth less tomorrow. This is basic human psychology. 


Exactly. And if Bitcoin rises in value for a long time and reaches the dizzying heights it has reached, why would anyone spend it? They can make more fiat by hodling the Bitcoin. This is why Bitcoin adoption is laughably bad: no one wants to spend the thing that is worth more tomorrow when they can hold onto it and make even more money (fiat and inflationary currency). So, think of Bitcoin like gold. Why would you spend gold on something when you can spend inflationary fiat instead? This is why inflationary currencies are good for an economy and deflationary ones are bad. This is also why we moved away from the gold standard (look this up, it's really interesting btw). Tl;dr for why we abandoned the gold standard: it didn't make sense to tie the growth of the economy to a physical metal because it capped the amount of growth possible in the economy to how much gold is on planet Earth. By removing this and replacing it with fiat, it stimulated the economy by keeping money moving between people and businesses and removed the physical cap on economic growth.

You just asked me to explain inflation and all its problems to you. You have no knowledge base on this subject at all. I'm not a professor of economics and even if I was, why would I waste several hours of my life describing how inflation affects an economy when there are literally tens of thousands of books on the subject?
If you have a *specific* question regarding inflation (such as what happens when inflation spirals out of control or why inflation happens) I am happy to discuss that with you, however, you are asking me to provide a lecture on the negative aspects of inflationary currency which is not something I have time for. You didn't even understand the concept of deflationary currencies and stores of value, so it's blatently obvious you haven't even remotely researched the subject. 
Do a little reading or ask me a *specific* question rather than a broad one (like "tell me about all the negative aspects that inflation can bring on any economy") because there are simply too many variables to answer your question in anything other than an actual hours long lecture on the subject because it's so broad and requires so much explanation.

So check back in ten years when paying in Bitcoin doesn't suck as badly as it does now?
I see your point, and furthering my point: the easier and safer method to pay will always be chosen over the harder method. Right now, Bitcoin is a harder method to pay for a coffee and as such, mass adoption won't be a thing until paying for things in Bitcoin is easier to do than hand over a simple plastic card or physical cash. 
So for the foreseeable future, Bitcoin adoption is a pipe dream.

Yeah a complete misunderstanding of basic logic. I gave a detailed explanation of why your logic is terrible but you keep misunderstanding what a simple "whataboutism" logical fallacy is and keep using it over and over and over. 
Also you keep saying "I think the energy usage is justified" and that's not even remotely the point. I could say the same thing about a gas guzzling SUV and say "but it's worth it to me because I like driving it and I can haul things with it", but that's not even remotely the point. The point is that there are better and more economic means of transportation but I am handwaving away these protests because I personally like my SUV. Same thing here. You're ignoring the point of people saying Bitcoin is wasting electricity by saying "but you don't understand I earn money from it!"

Bitcoin is also used in this way: 
Ban Bitcoin. 
Or, you could take the route of regulation, which is why sending any money to terrorists is illegal. Which is what they already do and there are tons of ways to catch fiat being sent to terrorists, but there's nothing such as OFAC for Bitcoin since it doesn't travel through regulated circuits, so the government punishes people *after* they've sent the money instead of being able to prevent it from being sent there in the first place with centralized systems like OFAC.

If you buy a mattress with a credit card, you can return it to the store for the same amount you paid for it if it complies with their return policy. Beyond that, no one is going to buy a mattress, then have their matress become obsolete and worthless. At the very least, it will be an uncomfortable one you don't want to sleep on, but you still own the matress and as such you can sell it or still use it for your guest bedroom or something. It doesn't just evaporate. 
With Bitcoin, you can't return it for the same value you purchased it with and if Bitcoin good belly up, you don't have an alternate use for it. If I bought $10,000 worth of Bitcoin today on credit and Bitcoin drops to $0 tomorrow, then how likely do you think it will be that I will pay back that $10,000? What incentive is there for me as a consumer to pay back $10,000 in unsecured debt that was created because I tried to get rich quick?
This is also the reason you can't buy stocks on credit. No bank is going to let you gamble with their money. 
As an add-on: this is where the phrase "intrinsic value" comes into play. A mattress has intrinsic value because it's a physical item that other people desire to own. It's made of materials that can possibly be recycled for other purposes. A Bitcoin has nothing of intrinsic value to it. If Bitcoin were labelled worthless tomorrow, there would be nothing left to do with the coins except delete them to free up memory space. No one wants to pay money to own a worthless currency except as a curiosity. Now before you get all huffy, yes the exact same thing is true for fiat, but unlike Bitcoin, fiat is accepted almost worldwide, so it's value is that almost everyone on planet Earth can use it and exchange it for items of intrinsic value (like food and clothing) whereas Bitcoin is only worth money to people who have computers and access to an internet connection. Until Bitcoin adoption is worldwide, it will *never* overtake fiat. , and while the prices fluctuates rapidly, no bank will allow you to purchase one on credit.

Do people directly use gold at the store to pay for items? No of course not. They use gold as a store of value then they cash in that when they want fiat cash. THEN they use that inflationary currency to make purchases. Same thing with Bitcoin. Go check any Bitcoin subreddit and you'll find hodlers who continually state "don't use Bitcoin for purchases, it's a store of value". This isn't my opinion that people don't spend deflationary currencies. They always hold them until it reaches a peak or they become desperate then they liquidate their gold to turn it into fiat. Look, here's a bitcoiner explaining exactly what I'm telling you:

You're literally making an invalid comparison. You can compare anything to something unrelated and make it sound good. The number of people counterfeiting compared to the number of pickpockets means that the government shouldn't worry about the counterfeiters since pickpockets are more prevalent.

@_date: 2018-03-28 22:28:55
Haha that's not remotely the same thing. Your example with the computer is because of the advancement of technology and has nothing to do with the currency. I'm specifically pointing out why using something that appreciates in value to pay for an item that depreciates is a very bad idea. 
For example, $500 towards a computer back in 1996 may have bought you a mid-range, slightly awesome computer at the time. But today $500 will buy you a pretty bottom of the line PC if it's an all in one box. This is inflation in action and why spending that $500 then is preferable to holding onto it and spending it on the same thing now. 
Back to my food comparison: if I spent $50 on food back in the 50s it would have bought me more food than if I saved that same $50 bill and tried to buy $50 worth of food now. If I had $50 worth of gold back in the 50s then saved it until today, it would be worth waaaaay more than $50. This is a deflationary asset and why it's a really stupid idea to spend them as a currency. But with an inflationary asset (like fiat) it makes perfect sense to spend it sooner rather than later. This is also why investments like IRAs and 401ks are popular because it means your inflationary currency will be worth more in the future because you will gain more of it over the years.

Tell me how I'm wrong.

But tell me what in my post is actually inaccurate or how you're going to get mass adoption of a technology that is very difficult to use and extremely slow, especially since we already have something that works better (fiat).
[Edit]: another Bitcoin user leaving the conversation when it gets tough. It's very similar to the reaction of religious people when you question something about their religion: they act as if that something is "just your opinion" then leave the conversation as quickly as possible because the question it raises concerns them and without a talking point to dispel it, they grow self-aware that their chosen belief is seen as silly.

No it's a stupid idea because it massively complicates returns for smaller merchants and they can avoid this by not even bothering. Not many bitcoiners actually use their Bitcoin anyways with all the talks of "hodl". This is why deflationary currencies are a really stupid idea: you make more money just sitting on the pile of currency than you make using it. In an inflationary currency, people are encouraged to spend rather than save because ten years from now, $1 USD won't buy as much as $1 USD does now, and this spending helps drive the US economy.

Strawman: an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.
False equivalency: two completely opposing arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are not. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of inconsistency.
I did not misrepresent your argument, you presented it as "Christmas lights use up more energy than Bitcoin". I did not misrepresent anything you said. You came to the *conclusion* (as opposed to the argument itself) that Bitcoin's energy usage was justified because you earn money on it, which is not the point of stating that Bitcoin uses up too much electricity. The point is that using up more electricity is worse than using up less. The structure of your argument is a whataboutism logical fallacy because it is structured to say that "because Bitcoin uses up less energy than Christmas lights therefore stop worrying about bitcoins energy usage". You added on that this comparison puts Bitcoin's energy usage "into perspective", but "perspective" isn't the reason why people say Bitcoin is wasteful. The fact that it eats up an astonishing amount of electricity is why they're saying it's wasteful.
I said this is a false equivalency because the only thing that is related between the two things is electricity and that's it. I could therefore say something similar: "my fiat money doesn't take any electricity to earn, therefore it's better than your Bitcoin since Bitcoin requires electrcity". It's the same structure of argument, I'm "putting Bitcoin's energy usage into perspective" by comparing it to another thing. This is why it's a logical fallacy because you can do this to any comparison and draw similar conclusions without actually saying anything useful or even addressing the original argument.

For the business, maybe. For the consumer, nah, they settle instantly. When I swipe my card at a store, they put a charge on my card by the time I get my receipt. The average consumer doesn't give a damn that the business side takes longer. The needs or wants of the business don't drive mass adoption to a new type of payment system, they bend to the desires of their customers. This is why most businesses accept fiat cards in the first place when cash is far more profitable: their customers demand it. 
How many customers do you think are demanding to pay in Bitcoin?

Retail 101: returns are always done in the original payment method. You can't buy a bunch of stuff on credit then return it for cash unless the business is willing to do so. On debit, they are usually willing to return cash, on credit, they will always return on the card unless the manager makes a special exception, but it's not likely because that's just a stupid idea from fraud prevention measures. This is my experience 100% of the time at every retailer I've ever returned an item to.

Let's say you're a business and you have just heard about this cryptocurrency mumbo jumbo. "It's a different way to pay for goods and services" you have been told. But hey, you already accept all cards and cash. No one has asked you in your store "hey do you accept Bitcoin payments", because, let's be honest, bitcoiners are a very tiny fraction of the populace (just basic fact). Even if one or two people have asked you, people have also asked if they could open up a tab so you don't notice one or two people mentioning it in passing. Besides, those people who did ask also know that not everyone accepts Bitcoin so they have fiat payment methods as well. 
Until banks start mass adoption of Bitcoin payments, the merchant isn't going to take the time and effort to accept Bitcoin when they know for a fact that such a tiny minority of the populace uses Bitcoin and that same group of people also has fiat payment methods. It's wasted time, effort and possibly money to accept Bitcoin right now.

Your post also disregards the fact that those workers would be commuting to work anyways regardless of whether they worked at a bank or not, so the comment about fossil fuel usage is hilariously dumb. 
Also your post ignores the fact that mining takes a significant amount of power, more so than what normal households actually consume, and if you have a significant portion of your population mining their power requirements rise exponentially.

Just because something is worth money doesn't mean it's a good investment. Did you miss the beanie babies comparison? That was a way to introduce what is called "intrinsic value" to the conversation and to show that (like beanie babies), cryptocurrency only has value because people say it has value. It has no "real" value on it's own and that was the point.
When a beanie baby is valued at $15,000 that doesn't mean it's actually *worth* $15,000.

This is a super dumb comparison because almost everyone in the nation puts up lights but only a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the population mines Bitcoin. If as many people who normally hang lights was the same as those who mined Bitcoin, then energy usage would skyrocket, it's just a fact. A Christmas light is just a string of LED bulbs that use up very little overall electricity. Mining uses up a massive amount of electricity, that's just a fact because it's not a string of LED bulbs.

This reply shows a fundamental misunderstanding of why unsecured debt is treated the way it is. 
A credit card company granting you a card is a very high risk activity because anyone can just charge it up and walk away from the card and refuse to pay it. That's why they put such high interest rates on cards so they can collect additional cash from people who pay in order to pay for those who walk away and also why higher credit scores receive lower interest and paying your bill on time every time will lead certain creditors to raise your limits without you asking for it. But certain kinds of activity are far riskier than others and gambling and investing are some of those. If I invest $10,000 in the stock market, there's a chance I can lose all of it. If I buy $10,000 worth of electronics there's no chance the electronics will just evaporate into the air, they have to be physically stolen and I will do my best to not have them stolen because I still owe on them. However, a stock can go bad almost instantly, and that's a much higher risk to the issuer than my $10,000 worth of electronics going bad (which btw I can return if they're defective, you can't return defective stocks). 
They have every right to do the same with cryptocurrency since you can buy up a shitload in Bitconnect and then it collapses as a scam an hour later, leaving you without any ability to repay and the likelihood of bankruptcy much higher than if I blew all my money on fancy TVs. 
This concept is known as Risk Based Lending. 


You can, but the credit card companies make it harder to go bankrupt, using "disincentives" to discourage you from running up massive bills by giving cash advance penalties and penalty interest.


Ehhh, sort of. I used to work for Wells during the middle of the time where all this was going on and what was happening is that the management said to the employees "you need to get [X] number of sales a day, if you don't get that, you're getting written up or fired". They defined "sales" as opening new accounts, debit card, credit cards and the like. And every year the goal got higher until it was completely achievable in certain places. So to keep their jobs, these employees turned to fraud by opening accounts people didn't ask for, sending them debit cards they didn't want, etc. It was an environment of fraud that was created because of unrealistic sales goals by upper management. I myself got a verbal warning from my boss when I failed to meet sales goals that month (barely missed it by a few dozen) because I refused to try and sell people things they didn't need or even remotely want. I once had my boss get mad at me because I refused to sell a credit card to a lady who couldn't even keep her checking account in balance. Wells didn't specifically steal identities, they just created an environment of extreme hostility towards their employees, then rewarded them for excessive sales, not even remotely caring where they came from. This is why their new accounts and credit card apps fell by 50-75% after they were caught.

I never said it was a good thing. I simply said it drove the economy and this is verifiably true: you can't have a thriving economy if no one is spending money because if no one is spending money then there are no jobs and even more people won't have money. If people's money is worth more money from day to day, it discourages people from spending that money, which removes it from supporting the economy.
There are other solutions to the problem of inflationary currency discouraging savings but those fall under social safety net categories rather than the basic structure of money. Also, people already have savings of inflationary currency. That's why a governments job is to cap inflation so runaway inflation doesn't cause people's savings to become obsolete like in Zimbabwe.

Sure, it's one thing to point to a person "cheating" in cryptocurrency and say "hey we all know you're cheating the system" but it's a whole other issue to actually bring punishment on that person and if there is no way to punish those people, then who cares if you can identify cheaters?

You have to work in retail at least once to understand that original purchases are usually returned to the original payment method. If you notice I never said that this was impossible, but not normal. If it were normal policy, what's to stop a card thief from buying a bunch or TVs on a stolen credit card then return them for untrackable cash so they don't have to sell them at a huge discount to fences or on Craigslist? Who would buy a TV on credit then ask for the return in cash so they could deposit the cash into their bank so they then can pay their credit card back instead of just returning to the original payment method in the first place?

This is dumb because a single branch location can serve an entire city depending on foot traffic. Also, online-only banks will reduce the carbon footprint of a bank significantly. Other advancements can be made to reduce energy usage like installing LED lights and setting up office lights on a timer. 
However, there will never be a way to streamline mining because of the massive computing power required, and if significant amounts of your population decides to start mining, your energy use shoots up dramatically. I think Sweden or some such announced that most of their power grid was going towards cryptocurrency mining rather than powering actual homes, which is god damn bonkers. 
Until something comes along to allow mining with less power in some way, mining will be worse than actual banks.

No because repayment options are required, as is proof of income. With cryptocurrency, it's a highly volitile thing that can gain crazy amounts or lose crazy amounts. If someone walked up to you and said "hey I want to borrow $2,000 of your money so I can go put it in my computer and maybe get more money back than I put in", you'd probably be skeptical and require some kind of physical collateral or contract to get repaid if that loan does not get repaid (known as a loan agreement). This is exactly why banks are refusing to allow cryptocurrency purchases without crazy fees so as to discourage people from running up high balances and possibly losing everything and leaving the bank as the bagholder for all that bad unsecured debt that is now callable. And this is also why they won't lend you money to go spend it on bitcoins: the chance of the price falling and the entire loan going bad are incredibly high.

2) no there is no such thing as an installment loan with 0% interest rate for the entire term
3) no your social security number is not stored on your debit card
4) no you can't go from a 450 credit score with multiple charged off loans and reposessions to 850 in three months
5) no there is no CD you can open that will give you a 15% interest rate just because you want it
6) if you invest money in the stock market there actually is a chance you will lose money, because risk is a thing
7) no you can't get a $45,000 car loan at &lt;1% interest rate for 84 months and have your monthly payment be lower than $100, that's not how math works and besides you have a 550 credit score so you're not getting the interest rates we give 750+ borrowers
Cryptocurrency has a huge uphill battle to get even seasoned bankers to understand and adopt it, the general public can't even handle basic banking.

You can't have the protection of the government if you don't play by their rules.

So it's up to the merchant to provide the service you need in order to fulfill your payment request. Why would they spend the time and money on that when they already operate with fiat? 
Also, I looked up the security on these mobile wallets. I like how when you fail entering the correct PIN sequentially that it locks you out of your own money for 40+ hours. This will go over great with the grandmas I deal with on a daily basis who can't remember their PIN number on their debit card for the fifth time in a row and are here to reset it. They will love being locked out of their own funds for 2-3 days because they forgot their PIN. Great idea.

You really don't understand the concept of someone living in an area with no cell phone signal or electricity do you? From 6-19 I lived in an area with no cell coverage and only solar power (with batteries). It would be impossible to transact on Bitcoin in those conditions. This is the way a lot of people live and that's why physical currency will never go away, until there is a nationwide power and internet grid that is either free to use or very low cost.

Or you could just keep your money in a bank and not have to do any of that stuff. Anyone of any intellect can use a bank account. I used to work in a bank that provided bank accounts to developmentally disabled adults. These people can't even wipe their own ass without assistance yet they could understand how to keep and operate a savings account because all they needed to remember was their bank account card and how much they wanted and then using the cash was as easy as presenting it to the cashier. Do you imagine an adult with the mental capacity of a ten year old could conduct a bitcoin transaction?

So "mining bitcoins on paper" is for people who can't read computer code...? Uh sorry to burst your bubble but you need to be able to understand code in order to be able to know exactly how bitcoins are mined. If you can't read code you can't figure out how to mine Bitcoin using paper. It's like trying to understand how a combustion engine works without even knowing what fire is.

Lmao sure buddy. Because cell phone batteries never die. Cell phones are never lost or broken. My last phone had a problem where it would have 80% battery then drop to 0% instantly while I was using it. I'd try to turn it back on and it would actually as if the battery was completely dead. I'd plug it in for 5 seconds then try again and then it would turn on and the battery level would display at 79% now. 
If I was 100% Bitcoin, I'd be unable to buy anything when my phone does this. 
But yeah Bitcoin is easier to use than fiat*
*Must have a working cell phone and active internet. 
Versus fiat where I can literally just hand someone a paper bill. Why are you fighting this point? AndroidPay is also harder to use than normal fiat as well but that doesn't make it a useless product, just a more inconvenient one. 
The fact that you're fighting me so hard on such a negligible point shows you don't want to see any possible problems with your precious bitcoins. You worship it like a literal god that can do no wrong. It's not divine. Just admit it has some problems and try to work on a solution. Offline Bitcoin is the only way it will overtake fiat because fiat can be used if the entire electrical grid goes down. Bitcoin doesn't work if you don't have the internet. That makes it objectively worse as a currency.

So, in other words, the scammers should continue to pray on the uninformed and screw them?
Can you not see how horrible a society that would be? Imagine if Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme was still running to this day because no regulation exists for that. Imagine if you went to eat at a new restaurant that just opened and sounds amazing then you get food poisoning because an employee decided to leave some chicken on the counter overnight. Imagine if you bought a car from a dealer after doing an astonishing amount of research only to discover that the dealership concealed a huge flaw in it and the engine seized up a month later and there was no regulation saying that the dealer was liable to pay for the fraud they just pulled on you (exactly this story happened to an IRL friend of mine and because of regulation he was able to sue and get his money back along with damages for the intentional fraud).
Because, as you implied: buyer beware. I guess it was on you for not completely tearing down that car down to it's last bolt to find that flaw. It's also on you for deciding to order the chicken knowing that no sanitation regulations are in place to protect you. It's also on you to be able to differentiate between a legitimate investment firm and one that is a hugely successful and slick Ponzi scheme that steals your entire retirement income. 
But yeah, regulation is bad. Sure buddy. You libertarians love to scream about the evils of regulation but the moment *your* life is negatively affected by no regulation you scream for the centralized authority to help you. Check out the Reddit forum for Bitconnect back when it was first discovered it was a Ponzi scheme. See how many people were demanding the arrests of the leaders of Bitconnect. I thought it was "buyer beware"?
You guys love to talk about "I do reasearch before buying something" but you do realize that scam businesses know that and bomb their Google and Yelp with fake reviews? Happened to another friend of mine. He wanted to buy a used car. The dealership had a 4.9/5 star rating on Google. The car looked great and the salesmen were friendly. Then I used the power of centralization to look up their BBB score and found it to be F-. They were Google bombing the reviews so they could sucker in more people. If the BBB didn't exist, how would you determine if you are going to do business with someone?
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:01:11


Yeah sure good luck with that. The price fluctuations alone make this an impossible concept until the price stabilizes similar to USD. This is because if last month the price of Bitcoin is 5K, and this month the price is 10K and next month it's 6k, then it's impossible to structure your business to pay your employees because the price is taking wild shifts. Let's say you charge a 5% fee to purchase Bitcoin, that means on the lean months your customer base drops significantly and now you're overstaffed. If it's a high month, then now you're understaffed. Your fee would have to change with the price, so when the price drops, your fees increase to make up the difference.
But then you have to figure out why anyone would want a cryptocurrency bank in the first place. The "bank" part is sorely missing since the bank wouldn't even dream of any kind of payment protection or Bitcoin "accounts" because that's what wallets are for. Then, you have to wonder who would even go into one? If you are a Bitcoin user already, you will just buy it off of an exchange for less than the brick and mortar "bank" and let's be honest, the cost of running a physical bank far exceeds the cost of running a website. If you're not a Bitcoin user, then you might be the target audience...until you discover exchanges where you can drastically lower the fees you pay for Bitcoin. It's the same thing that is happening to brick and mortar stores everywhere: people are discovering you can buy the same product on Amazon, get free shipping and also get it on sale so it's cheaper than your local store. I completely stopped going to game and electronic stores completely once I found out how amazing Amazon is. 
What a dumb concept.

It's the libertarian mindset: they love no regulation as long as it benefits them (make 1200% gains in bitcoin and pay no taxes), but then demand the gubment come help them when their Bitcoin is stolen by another libertarian.

Yep and let me tell you why this is required in a first world country: stupid people will always exist. They're born every day. Hell when I was 16 I even fell for a "your computer has 53 viruses" type pop-up window on the internet. I had never encountered this scam before and it downloaded a Trojan to my laptop to the point I had to wipe it. I would laugh at such an attempt now, but back then I was naive. I wasn't purposefully stupid just uninformed because no one told me about this kind of scam. 
If I had stored by life savings on a cryptocurrency wallet and thought that it was safe to store my key on my computer (that is now wiped by a virus), I am suddenly penniless. I might become homeless or desperate and start mugging people in order to not be evicted. So now because there was no method of me getting that money back that was stolen by the simple virtue of me misunderstanding Bitcoin security I am now a criminal and a liability to society. 
Let's now say that Bitcoin is the only currency in the US. How many people do you think would have similar stories: small mistake or large ignorance caused them to lose every penny they had? How badly do you think that would affect society when scammers are free and clear to fleece as many people as they want and no central authority to stop them? Sure everyone else would start a campaign of information to tell people how to secure their wallets, but it wouldn't completely prevent the crime. 
A law doesn't prevent crime either but it does provide at least some kind of punishment so the scanners can't operate indefinitely by preying on the ignorant and generating millions of penniless desperate people every year.

Dude I have to deal with people every day who can't even remember where they left their debit card or PIN. This person would lose all their cryptocurrency almost instantaneously by virtue of simply losing their key. Baby boomers still fall for the "your computer Apple has 67 battery virus call Microsoft to pay for virus remove" emails. It would be super easy to prey on these folks and fleece millions from them a day. This would also exponentially increase the number of homeless and desperate people because there's no way to get that money back. If they send $500 worth of Bitcoin to a scammer, oh well you learned a valuable lesson SFYL. If they give their debit card number to a scammer who then charges $500 on their card, no big deal here's some paperwork to get your money back. 
There was a thread in a cryptocurrency subreddit a while back that stated this guy wrote down two private keys for two wallets he gave to his family with $500 each of cryptocurrency in them. He made an Excel file of the private keys, then *engraved the keys into metal* (lmao I'm sure everyone has an engraver at home so they can keep their key safe) then forgot to delete the original file. Malware got onto his computer and then the wallets were emptied. SFYL, too bad so sad.
If he had stored his online banking info on his computer and his accounts were emptied, just file some paperwork with your bank and hey it's all back!
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:34:26


Which is why regulation exists. If the rules are optional or not even written, then surprise surprise some people won't follow them. If you make the rules compulsory and prosecute those who don't follow the rules, then hey look at that everyone else is going to try and follow the rules. Then, when they figure out a clever way of circumventing the rules, more rules are created to stop that. 
But nah, let's have a completely unregulated cryptocurrency market with almost no way to punish wrongdoers who scam people out if millions. That sounds like a great idea.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:53:12
Because things never get lost or stolen. Nope, never. Muggings never happen. Dropping something when putting it back in your pocket never happens.
I once forgot my credit card at a restaurant. I didn't notice it was gone until I went to pay at a bar later that night and noticed my card was missing. If it had been used fraudulently, I'd get 100&amp; of those charges reversed. But bitcoin is for big boys. You big boys don't need any fancy smancy protection from fraud because you've never lost anything in your life, ever. I'm sure that will continue for the rest of time.
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:47:43
If banks go away, where do people keep their money? In a cryptocurrency wallet. If their wallet gets compromised, there goes their life savings, retirement and God knows what else. 
Until cryptocurrency has a fraud refund system (who would pay for it btw?), banks will continue to exist because people don't want to lie awake at night thinking of all the ways their money can be stolen from their cryptocurrency wallet. They just want their money to be safe and in a bank it is safe. If someone steals their cash with a fraud check, steals their debit card, etc it is covered and their money will be returned. That allows people to sleep soundly.

Even if this was true (it's not), but let's say it is 100% accurate: 
So? If every single cent of my banks money is stolen I am GUARANTEED to get every single penny back up to $250,000 because of NCUA/FDIC insurance (huge benefit of centralization). Cryptocurrency has no such guarantee. This is a simple fact. Also, there exist other fraud protection measures against fraud checks and zero liability protection for fraudulent purchases on my credit or debit cards. I work in a bank and have filed thousands of such forms over the years and gotten every stolen penny back for every customer I see. 
If someone steals all my bitcoins from an exchange, I'm fucked. SFYL.

You *can* do something that is against your best interests (paying taxes in cryptocurrency/punching yourself in the face) or you can choose to do what's in your best interest (don't get taxed on paying taxes just like don't punch yourself in the face).
It's an analogy. To further show you why paying anything in Bitcoin is stupid let's use this example:
Let's say I do my taxes and find out I owe the gubment $500. I want to pay in Bitcoin and let's say it's worth $9100 as it was yesterday. Today it is worth $8800 as of the writing of this post. If I pay in Bitcoins alone, then I pay 0.056 Bitcoin. If I paid yesterday then I paid a USD amount of approximately $510. If I paid the same amount of Bitcoin today then I pay $492. Why would I ever use Bitcoin to pay when I can cash out the fiat I need and use that to pay only $500?
This is why Bitcoin is a garbage currency until the value stabilizes.
