The advantage of tinycoin is that saying the address outloud "tinycoin.info/something" is immediately comprehensible.  btcaddr.es is not easy to communicate verbally without specifying the modified spelling and location of the ".".  Thanks for the heads up though.
P.S. I just realized you actually made that.  Sneaky.

Why do they have to spoil everything?

No, I just explained it briefly in my email along with a link to the Bitcoin Foundation blog post.

Way to go! And Altadena, no less.  I'm right nearby in the other ___dena.  I particularly like your point about it being a system of ownership that could be useful in developing countries:

Y'all are such babies. Wahhh, he doesn't cater to us, waaaah. What is even the point of this post? "Remember, he's not one of us!" What possible value could there be to such a tribal attitude? None. Just confirms peoples' negative views of this community.
And, you've forgotten that if his company succeeds, you will likely benefit from expanded acceptance and use of Bitcoin.

I managed to explain why the "bitcoin glitch" doesn't allow coin theft in about 3 sentences as did many other sources, like the Bitcoin Foundation. ~~So I would say you oversimplified and thereby distorted the issue.~~ Wait, you meant you respectfully disagree with his desire to simplify? I misunderstood.  So yes, it sounds like you tried to explain it to him, but he just went with the sensational and inaccurate headline instead.  Sigh.

Is no one else surprised they left the last 4 of his SSN, and CC# in the video? Or were they edited?

    The Internet can.

If this is legit, I am in awe of this man's lack of even basic common sense regarding the management of this (HUGELY VALUABLE) business as well as its communication with the outside world.  It seems more and more clear that he's completely in over his head and incompetent and simultaneously unwilling to come to grips with that &amp; let go.

Looks like he took our feedback seriously.  I'm impressed.

Is the OP, in your opinion, sharing facts? Because to me it seems like his entire second paragraph is definitely his (inflammatory, ill-informed, defensive) opinion, not facts.
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:06:35
Seems like a straightforward admission of guilt to me.  But then he back tracks and blames it in the Foundation. Pretty silly.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:17:12
The majority of what OP has said is not substantiated in any sort of reasoned or evidenced based argumentation. And much of it cannot be, because, to my knowledge, there is no evidence supporting these fairly wild assertions. It's just a big wishlist stated as if it were fact.
Yes, bitcoin is great and interesting and useful. But OP's tone and fanatical rhetoric is absurd.

He's a smart dude who knows how to learn about the world but he has a clear track record of not understanding technology. Let's just accept that and move on instead of using obnoxious "quotes" in our "posts."

This sub is not the place for reasonable advice. Go to a (edit: fiduciary) professional financial planner. Good luck, and don't do anything rash.
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:03:04
Wow another naively idealistic post in that ignores obvious practical realities in order to self-bukkake with more Bitcoin jizzkarma

I panicked at that little dip at ~320 after a YEAR of waiting  and got out and completely missed this. The sads are so deep.

Both product and site look awesome.  It's a bit steep for me at present but I would consider it if there was a special run.  Also, perhaps a promotion where "used" or no longer needed engraved cards could be returned for a partial discount?  Not sure how useful that tiny amount of steel is to you, though.  But might be a good way to encourage repeat business.
