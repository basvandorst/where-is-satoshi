OK, you understand the blockchain and you understand identity.  How is this actually “storing identity on the blockchain”  (or “verifying identity”)
Is this all that different from just digitally signing the particulars of a transaction?
“It works by taking a cryptographic hash of a user's personal information and using that hash to create a certificate, which is then recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.”
So I send you $20 to mow my lawn and then sign a document with “To John Smith from Jane Johnson, $20 for lawn service” and put that on the blockchain.
It is in a central ledger, but so what?

It would be interesting to learn how much of the cost of an item is due to fraud.  I am in a startup working with fraud prevention, and when we talk to companies I am always shocked at the amount of fraud they have -- it is staggering.  Any web company with any significant volume has an entire fraud team.   We've seen some fairly niche online merchant sites with close to a million in fraudulent purchases.  
Bitcoin does seem to solve that completely.  The merchants may be able to offer a non-trivial discount, if they can truly reduce their fraud costs.  At that point the merchants themselves may help users get set up with Bitcoin, just because it saves the merchant money.

Nothing.  In this case the biometric doesn't prove you are you.  It is a secondary connection to a driver's license.  If someone stole your ID and used their biometric, they could effectively masquerade as you.  At least until you tried to register later with your replacement ID.  At that point they would have two different biometric records tied to the same ID.

(I work in biometrics)
"Biometrics" covers a lot of territory.  Some are very secure, and some not so much.  It depends on the design.  
The use of biometrics (say a fingerprint reader) could add a lot of security to a hardware wallet.   I wouldn't want it to be the only form of security, but it could be a great secondary factor.  I don't know much about the EKG thing, but it could be really cool because it would be hard to fake, especially if there was some mechanism to prevent a brute-force attack.  I would think it would have a lot of false rejects, though (or be tuned to accept almost anything, causing a lot of false accepts)
However, it is going to be hard to really secure anything that you lose possession of.
Personally, I don't see a read need for a hardware wallet that I carry around.  I keep around $100 worth of BTC on my phone, which is about $99.99 more than I need on a daily basis.  If I lose my phone, I lost $100, so no big deal.

That's an interesting link, thanks.  It seems like there are two things that help them a lot:
The images aren't rotated (although they could modify the algorithm to detect that)
The images they are checking are going to be quite a bit different from each other compared to facial or fingerprint images.  This would reduce the chance of an accidental collision (false positive)
Personally, I don't see what the paranoia is here.  They could store a true unencrypted face or fingerprint template on the device and transmit that to the server.  There is no way to reconstruct a face or fingerprint from a template.

I realize this isn't feasible in a practical sense, but if you could get all of the network to agree, you could essentially change any amount of coins in any address to some other address?

With Doge, I could mine and actually see how all that stuff works.  I tried out regular pools, I tried out multipools, it was all really interesting.
It also got me interested in developing coin stuff as well.  I compiled dogecoind and learned that API and built a few test applications.  It is much less nerve-wracking dealing with Doge than BTC in a live environment.  And because they are build to the same API, I can easily transition to a Bitcoin app later if I want.
If Doge did nothing else but provide a test environment that was "semi real" but low-risk, it has been valuable to me.
Personally, I think it is going to live on for a while at low value, if for no other reason than to poke fun at Bitcoin.

I would be interested to read it.
Fingerprints give you points that are basically X,Y and theta.  On a given finger, those are approximately the same for every sensor collection.  But out of, say 40-50 points on a finger you might get 20-30 on any given sensor image.  And of those, maybe 5-10 are reliably the same.
I can see how there might be a mathematical way to take that and generate the same signature from it, since there is a core set of data and non-random data around it.  I sure wouldn't know how to do it, though.
I know there has been some work on trying to generate a hash from a fingerprint.  But none of it has been successful enough to be used in practice.  It would have the potential to really speed up fingerprint matching, which is typically 1:N now.
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:16:21
I don't see any easy way to do that because a fingerprint doesn't generate a consistent template (binary) that could be used to generate a key.  
It is more of a vector map of feature points that varies depending upon how you place your finger.  A fingerprint match just means that a lot of those points match.
@_date: 2015-04-11 20:52:52
Interesting concept.  I have a couple of problems with it.
First, I don't know of a reliable way to get a repeatable template from a biometric in order to establish a key from it.  Let's look at fingerprints.  When you present a fingerprint to a sensor, it gets minutia points where ridges branch, end, etc.  But you won't always get the same points depending upon temperature, position, lighting, etc.  For matching that is fine - you only need to match N points.  But if you want the fingerprint to look exactly the same every time you present it, I don't know of a way to do it.
Also, as said, even if you could do that you run into problems.  Biometrics can be captured remotely.  I've worked on systems that can capture irises and fingerprints from 8' away.  Faces can be captured from 100's of feet away.  No way to prevent remote capture.
Biometrics are good as a complement to other mechanisms, as an additional factor.  It is also fine for low-security applications, or applications where you can be sure the person is presenting their own biometrics.
I don't see a good way to make something work like you describe.

Also, if you donate, he will *greatly* appreciate it. I don't know about you, but when I donate money, I general get lackluster appreciation.

I don't think that is true.  You can only play the lottery twice a week, so it is going to take you a minimum of 5 weeks to win the lottery 10 times.  If I am really^99 lucky, I can guess a private key on my first try.
What would really suck is guessing a private key and finding like .001 BTC.

Extortion involves a threat to harm someone, kidnap them, or harm their reputation.  BFL did none of that.
If I run a hot dog stand and I say "You must tap dance for me before I give you a hot dog" that is perfectly within my right.
If the BFL customer wasn't happy with the situation, he should have canceled his order.  It wasn't like BFL was holding his money hostage.  If BFL had said "you must apologize before we give your money back" things would be different.  The BFL customer has every right to demand his money back since BFL didn't deliver.  But BFL has an equal right to fire the customer and not have to put up with abuse.  
Now, I am not talking about whether this is good business practice or not, just that the rights of the respective parties.  
Personally, if I was BFL I would have just canceled his order and refunded his money without another word, apologies notwithstanding.

No one should buy BTC on eBay.  However, not every seller is a crook.  I tried to buy like $20 worth just to have some to experiment with.  I sent the payment to the guy using PayPal, and he didn't like something about my account.  He just refunded my money, although he could have kept it and I couldn't have done anything about it.

It's not semantics.  It is about legal definitions, which are supposed to be as objective as possible.
What threats did he use?  He "threatened" to give the customer his money back?  That's not what most people would see as a threat.
Just because someone is a customer doesn't give them unlimited license to be a douche.

Yeah, that could work.  It would be a little more effort, but you could send the bot a PM with the user's name and the amount (and maybe even reference the comment).  It would all be behind the scenes, kind of like how Reddit Gold is now.
This would be a great thing to add to the Reddit Enhancement Suite.  They could just add a button under the comment.  You click it and type in amount and the rest is done for you.

Technically, every penny you destroy is kind of like "profit" for the government.

It happens.  I have been shorted twice and got extra money once.
I don't think it is possible to make something that counts physical paper be 100%.  There are just too many variables - humidity, crap on the bills, dust, worn out rubber, etc.
Of course, a traditional ATM is not going to give you $1400 when it intended to give you $700...

There were also joke PSAs about the suicide hotline when the crash happened as well.
I love that Bitcoin has an annoying little brother who doesn't take things seriously.

The contract was broken much, much earlier when BFL didn't deliver as promised.  At that point anyone could have gotten their money back.  After that point, if people stay in they are doing so with full knowledge of the situation.  They could have gotten out at any point where they felt uncomfortable, but they didn't.  If this guy thought BFL was so bad, **why doesn't he just take the refund**?
From what I can see **any** bitcoin mining hardware is a highly speculative, highly risky investment.  People should only be in this game if they can tolerate the risk.

+100 doge
I agree with you.  It would be great if Reddit would add an API to allow for virtual currency tips without all the comment spam.  I don't see any way to do that now with Reddit changing things.
The problem with that approach is that you need some unobtrusive way to show someone has been tipped.

How in the world is that extortion?  They offered to give his money back.  Extortion is a demand of money in exchange for some action or inaction.
Try going into any store and handing them money for something.  While you are waiting for your order, start cursing everyone in the store.  You will probably get your money back and be asked to leave.

Seems like a cool way to have a secure wallet.  Not easily reachable by a virus, and when combined with biometrics and a password, very secure.
Do you know what the false accept rate on those cheapie sensors is?  I would be worried about someone just trying a bunch of fingers until they get in.

There is a ten second lag for each captcha, but you can run as many in parallel as you want.  You could do 10,000/s.  There is no reason you have to wait for  to finish before you start

I don't know the specific contractual details of the BFL orders, but in general a business can refuse to do business with whomever they want, for almost any reason (not race or protected stuff).  Businesses refuse to deal with assholes all the time.  
Legally, they certainly could go to Facebook to look for bad posts and cancel any order they wanted, as long as they refund the money.  It might negatively impact their business, but it is legal.

Bitcoin, while interesting, will inevitably settle at $0. It may happen next week, or next month, or it may continue on for six months. The only reason to pay anything over $0/Bitcoin today would be in an attempt to turn a quick profit before that happens, but it will happen, once the fad passes (or another fad coin more "in the moment" comes along). If you get seriously burned by Bitcoin, though, you only have yourself to blame.

If I had more than the 2 I have now, I would spread them out, but not because I was worried about people guessing my private key. I would be worried about losing then to hackers or random acts of whatever. Any loss you can imagine is more likely than someone guessing your private key.

Unless your "hobby" websites are really kicking, this law won't apply to you.


This is meaningless.  The tax is not on the seller, it is on the buyer.  The fact that the seller consumes no local resources, nor has representation is  totally irrelevant.
This law will add complexity to the transaction, but complexity can be managed with an algorithm.  The current playing field is decidedly unlevel for brick and mortar vs online.  I would love to continue to not pay tax for online purchases, but everyone has to know this day will come eventually.

You are more likely to win the lottery (the 6/49 one) ten times in a row than guess a private key:
13,983,816^10 = 2.8 x 10^71

I decided to check the math on this.  A fingerprint template has between 20 and 40 minutiae points.  A minutiae point is X,Y, and theta.  So that would give (apprx)
500x500x360x20 different combinations = 1.8x10^9
That's a lot smaller than 2^256.  There are other problems as well, because you can't reliably get the exact same set of points from the sensor each time, so I don't see how it could be used as a key in any case.
There are other points available (things like sweat pores, etc.)  but those are even more unreliable that minutiae points.

I've found the cheap bitcoins to be a lot less durable than the more expensive bitcoins. Not worth it, IMHO. Buyer beware.
