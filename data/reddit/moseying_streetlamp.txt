Obligatory "This is good for Bitcoin"
CME has nothing to do with Bitcoin as a protocol or Bitcoin as a currency. They are making side-bets on the price without ever interacting with the actual currency. This means that the people buying these futures are purely speculators with no actual interest in Bitcoin as a currency or as a store of value. It was the speculators that were skyrocketing the value in the first place. If the effect of this side gambling is reducing the perceived value, that value was never real in the first place and we are simply seeing a correction to a value based on the actual utility and merits of Bitcoin.

Not related to my original question but why would anyone buy mining equipment if it never pays off?

Someone else just told me that I will be matched with a seller at the price I posted. So now I have 3 different answers.

Hmmm. That is unfortunate to hear. I was hoping to avoid transferring money to an exchange when it seems like they are getting hacked on a regular basis. Maybe I'll just start requesting my paycheck in BTC...

The whole point with children though is that they may not have the life experience or information to judge whether or not something is reasonable. Obviously there are times where this isn't the case but that's why it's only a heuristic.

Hope I'm not late to the party. I always seem to miss out on these kinds of posts

I'm not drawing a line anywhere. I've known plenty of people over the age of eighteen to be perfectly unreasonable. But I can also look back on my childhood and realize that some of my parents "ridiculous" restrictions on my behavior might have been warranted.

If the funding goals are still denominated in US dollars, doesn't the % funded constantly change? The success of this platform is wholly contingent on the stabilization of the bitcoin exchange rate.

It's easy to justify dropping a few bucks on a cup of coffee because even if the value of bitcoin doubles, you've only lost a few bucks. That gamble doesn't really scale when you start thinking about buying a car or a set of furniture.

My theory is that because of the way that bitcoin grew, a lot of people found themselves acting as amateur currency traders without even realizing it. Most people wouldn't think to go open an account and starting buying euros/yen/rupees etc

I don't have an extensive list but I don't feel like its that much of a stretch to say that kids don't always know whats best for themselves. A couple examples off the top of my head.
* Don't go too close to the edge of the cliff. You might fall. (I'm not going to fall)
* Stop throwing medicine balls at your brother in the pool. (I'm not going to hit him. I'm just trying to get close)
* Don't walk home by yourself in the dark. (Nothing is going to happen to me.)

Based on the thumbnail, I was fully expecting the video to be [this]( It seems just as relevant.

My calculations suggest that by dropping point  in your speech, you could improve your probability of success by over 9000%
