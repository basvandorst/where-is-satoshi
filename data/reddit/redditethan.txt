I understand what you're saying IMHO you must give a site some time to scale up to a huge new influx of visitors because of a topic like this one here.
Full disclosure: have been using BTC24 myself nog for a number of weeks and I do love it. :)
Support and response to situations has been great so far so I have complete faith that this situation of being "Reddited" will also be dealt with correctly. :)

It was/is a combination of events:
- Large influx of new visitors (3x normal unique IPs)
- A switch died at the hosting provider
Last but not least:
- It is now listed on the site that:"Slow Server - The 10*10G between Beauharnois and Montréal are down. Repair operations are in progress. The impacted links should come back up after 6pm Montreal localtime."
So just a very unlucky combination of events..
