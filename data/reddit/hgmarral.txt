The differentiation is the dark pool product. If anyone wants to implement dark pool dex without KYC the protocol will enable people to build that if they want to as well.

Hi, just making a comment here from the team.  
The protocol is decentralized, anyone that wants to build their own dark pool on it is free to implement **whatever rules they want.** With RenEx - the dark pool built on the protocol by us (the first one), we are doing KYC because the vast majority of OTC players **need** this for compliance reasons to actually be able to trade. It would be leaving out the majority of the OTC market/traders if we did not do this, and for how we want to bring this to market focused on the OTC space it just doesn't make sense for us to do otherwise.

Got to agree with you there. One of my professors(at an Australian university though) made us do an assignment on blockchain/cryptocurrency in the hope that someone could explain it to him because he had no idea

If you look at previous rampant speculation in the markets there are people sitting out, calling for a crash the whole way up. It's only when these people finally get in do we get a crash

Finding alts that have a stronger market mechanism to their use such as energy trading would be a good starting point

Exponential growth is extremely difficult for humans to visualize, it could quite possibly be way higher than that by 2025

Everyone knows about Bitcoin now but it's still yet to really reach the masses in terms of using it as a currency for everyday applications, we are nowhere near it's true potential
