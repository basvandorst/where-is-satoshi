You missed SEC.. wall street bonuses and chinese new year
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:53:06
This is actually looking even more scary.. tht growth looks artificial.. meaning 2019 low could be way lower than 2018
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:53:41
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:00:11
Looking at this pic i would never invest.. looks more like a scam
@_date: 2019-01-23 02:15:14
Is there a way to claim tax deductions in US for mining hardware costs?
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:41:04
Jokes apart that is a brilliant idea.. when i was researching location to store my security DVR, i read articles about attic being one of the safest places since theives would hesitate getting cornered there
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:17:56
What happened virgins?? Your godfather sunerok started dumping his bags on you already?? Is top3 still coming?? Bring on the downvotes.. 
Sorry i wanted to post this on verge sub but they have blocked me. Thanks for your cooperation 
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:14:13
It kind of is obvious this makret is manipulative in both directions.. pump and dump both. We have not seen any organic growth here yet that would be proportional to a product growth. e.g amazon grew because their company amd development grew.. BTC mooned for no apparent reason
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:24:06
Some people think its cheap bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:00:51
Total FUD manipulation of price
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:37:41
Please read the latest comment in the series. That advice is not valid anymore
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:28:17
They would just not let it go up.. fre** bears and our tether bois
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:34:36
Thats smart
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:16:37
Wish I knew what FOMO meant
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:51:54
Market tries to go up and someone is like forcing it back down.. wonder who wants to really sell at these prices.. at this point now feels like pure manipulation to accumulate on large scale and later moon will definitely come, just need patience... whales and institutions think long term
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:24:09
lol explained my hidden emotions
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:24:40
Is anybody tracking that Mt Gox wallet? Large spikes in sell offs could indicate fear in the market
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:27:56
Hahaha thats actually true people have downvoting based on emotions.. i think overall morale is low because of this bearish market for last 3 months
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:35:18
Anddddd some new people think its too expensive to afford. They can buy a million trons for the same price
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:36:01
Is this true if we buy e.g ETH we pay like sales tax on it being considered asset like a house.. i convert it to now e.g LTC i pay taxes again like i bought another house... and so on with however many trades i keep doing like keep buying houses and pay sales tax each time... and on top i pay taxes on fre**ing capital gains on every single trade?? Is it really that horrible or i am getting wrong information
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:34:29
Good progress. But these ATM people srw crooks charge a lot. We need more of these companies to increase competition and bring down reasonable proce for customer
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:20:24
Good possibility. But again that could be a speculation and they are already using it to mimic a minor bull trap as we approach April 17th. And this i think applies to only US investors. Only time will tell, but im also hoping we have closed Q1 of this year and different cycle should prevail in Q2
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:52:46
I am missing the joke can someone explain.. my lack of knowledge
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:31:15
ummm ...... No... no trap.. its just a pure &amp; clean bull run
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:48:53
Does it say what year? :(
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:10:33
Valid point. But are there really that many miners to suppress btc like in current situation
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:53:57
Not anymore.. now i have become smart.. going to wait for it to become zero just to be 100% safe
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:31:25
And what if today is the last day btc is ever seen above 5k... RUN!!! SELL!!! TETHER 
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:03:25
Buying more it dips more i lose more i cry more
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:23:18
None or all of the above is mostly the correct choice
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:41:06
Thanks to both all 3 of u guys... i now understand this better 
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:57:31
It may not be large amount but we all saw its impact. Fear
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:39:27
Wow thats brutal... good to know ��
