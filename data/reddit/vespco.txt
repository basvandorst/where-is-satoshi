Isn't the point of adding schnorr to do such coinjoins? What other benefit does it have?
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:51:58
Your analogy doesnt work here. Bitcoin is either transparent and stops corruption or it has privacy features that facilitate it.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:09:54
Why would a bank even be involved with bitcoin? Dumb example lol
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:10:34
Banks don't need to use coinjoin to launder.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:09:02
Because they don't want too? They could easily do it with SQL and a website.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:50:13
Exactly. LN on the other hand :P
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:31:46
Doesn't the existence of a private crypto undermine the value proposition of a traceable one? I.E You can't force people to be public and traceable if they have the option to use a private fungible one.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:29:11
I see. So are you saying that schnorr signature aggregation and doing it the cheapest way possible, may not provide very good obfuscation?   
It is good news regardless, as it will also make it cheaper to do proper (for privacy) coinjoins, but just thinking ultimately it may not result in a shift of a more private bitcoin because the very cheapest option will reveal nearly as much data as 1 to 1 transactions do currently.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:50:39
But they aren't forced to use it. There are alternatives to transparent ledgers for those things so it actually doesnt make any difference at all.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:30:38
That is why it isn't a success.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:07:14
Exactly. Crypto has no impact in this regard.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:05:25
Banks can already do that. If bitcoin doesnt suit them for their desires to launder money or act badly, they simply won't do it. You can't force them now and you don't be able to do so later.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:10:13
Also, do exchanges do that now?
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:35:33
Half the people in this subreddit: It will stop money laundering because it is on a public traceable ledger!   
The other half: It will be as anonymous as Monero because of CoinJoin, Wasabi, Graftroot, taproot, schnorr signatures, LN, etc.   
I never see anyone fighting about this within the BTC community, but rather just saying bitcoin is the solution to both problems and never thinking critically about the two contradictory narratives they peddle.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:13:38
The whole bitcoin community has been and they don't even realize that half have a view so different from the other half that they should effectively be enemies as the goals are vastly different.

It's not bad. A huge feature of bitcoin is that it is a public traceable ledger. It is what will keep banks and governments honest. Reuse of address is good to do for society.

@_date: 2019-07-04 18:24:32

@_date: 2018-09-06 10:44:28
No, but refund transactions, which is what will be used for Monero's version of cross chain atomic swaps, and I think it's LN are being developed. The refund transactions work together with thring signatures to make it all possible:
"6.4  Cross-chain, confidential, spender-ambiguous atomic swaps
Simple cross-chain atomic swaps using thring signatures are possible. If all goes well, the swap goes like this: Alice sends x AliceCoins to the 2-of-2 key on the AliceCoin chain,Bob sends y BobCoins to the 2-of-2 key on the BobCoin chain, and once both parties are satisfied, they can collaborate to claim their funds. Of course, we cannot assume all goes well; as described in refund transactions allow for semi-honest parties to halt the process in an adversarial environment. All that remains to complete a spender-ambiguous model of the cross-chain atomic swaps from for a digital currency using confidential transactions is to formalize refund transaction capabilities for that currency (c.f. \[17\])."
No idea when this will happen, but Monero moves fairly quickly.
@_date: 2018-09-26 00:01:45
The reward for each miner just has to exceed their investment in the miner. A bunch of small miners might find this a very good option, especially if their ROI is looking unlikely since the price is already so low and the difficulty so far. 
Plus, don't forget you can short bitcoin so you could really hedge against any losses there. 
And, you can always mine on other sha256 coins after the fact, or on bitcoin if it doesn't kill it.

A monero user can selectively reveal transaction info via the private view key.   
Just as bitcoin can attempt to obfuscate via coinjoin, etc.   
But more so my point was that if the narrative is bitcoin makes the world more honest, it is untrue because there is another option. Those who want privacy now can still get it in a post fiat/crypto only world.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:10:26

@_date: 2018-09-06 20:23:35
Yep which is a large criticism about it, that it's blockchain can't be pruned but there is high hopes that in the future, once Zk-STARKs are matured (kes less computing and the math behind it is proven) the Zk-STARKs can potentially compress the monero blockchain significantly.
So, I'm not too worried about that either.

Exactly. So, BTC can sync from BCH nodes prefork. As you say, that trunk is the same trunk for BTC as it is for BCH. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:52:14
There is still the same number of bitcoin regardless how many altcoins there are.   
However, if one of them does something better then Bitcoin such as it is fungible (Monero) then some people will hold and prefer the other currency  over bitcoin, reducing it's demand. This causes the price of bitcoin to go down, but doesn't alter it's total supply.

Also, arguably Satoshi did it to get rich and that is why he still has his 1.5 million coins, worth whatever billions. You think Satoshi was 100% altruistic in a fashion that wasn't also beneficial to himself? Odd. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:16:27
It doesn't have a feedback loop though. 
Network effects need customer lock in and high switching costs, as well as a network that benefits from more users.
Most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, do not have any of those: 
High switching cost: Anyone can easily create an address and install whatever client for any other cryptocurrency. They can do it along side bitcoin often using the same wallet software/hardware. The switching cost is almost nothing. 
Costumer loci in: you can easily use multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously, at little to no cost. you can quickly and easily exchange them for one another with services like shapeshift.io, cake wallet, and many others, like XMR.TO.  (and it will become less centralized/require less trust when cross chain atomic swaps are integrated into wallets). 
Network benefit from more users? Nope. Not with the fact that you can quickly and easily exchange bitcoin for other coins and vice versa.  On chain transactions actually decrease utility of it, by higher fees, and/or lower confirmation times. 
Additionally, remember the network isn't the number of people  willing to spend bitcoin but rather the number of people willing to accept it as payment and hold it. That can have vastly different results. 
Additionally, if what you were saying is true, bitcoin wouldn't be gradually losing out to other cryptocurrencies in several different ways.  It's losing utility on the darknet, it is losing marketcap, number of transactions vs number of all cryptocurrency transactions, etc.

And, what is it being used for? 
Monero has use on the darknet, more so then bitcoin lately - or rather it's adoption is faster then bitcoin on the darknet. 


Largely true for bitcoin also - adoption of bitcoin as a payment is not that great and many places have dropped it, like reddit. Many others are happy to accept all cryptocurrencies - Overstock.com accepts Monero and every other coin offered by shapeshift. 


Bullshit. It is ALL speculation. BTC prices has gone from $1K to $20K to $7K in the last two years. Not much of a "store" of value, as opposed to a highly volatile, primarily fueld by speculation, asset. 
Other coins offer the same "store of value" as bitcoin.

Lookup the anonymity issues with zcash - jumping in and out of Monero to bitcoin suffers from exactly the same problems, and the solution is the same; you must keep and transact in the private coin if you want any anonymity. Jumping in and out can correlate amounts and timing, revealing the user.

Satoshi spent coins, but most of those he mined early were not spent. That agrees with that I said earlier. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:45:02
So, do you not think that fungibility is important? It isn't so much about anonymity of users, etc but rather you need to have 1 XMR = 1 XMR. 
But, that isn't the case with bitcoin. Imagine if a bitcoin from the second block ever mined, so it is satoshi's bitcoin, were sent to me - I could be famous, it would absolutely be on the news. 
Other bitcoins are associated with crime, can be seized or black listed, or frozen - this does and has happened. 
Worse yet is other bitcoins can be associated with others held by the same person: perhaps it results in discounts, or refusal to do business with you, and so on. 
If it isn't fungible it cant really be a currency. Paypal is more private then Bitcoin; both share info with other companies and government, but at least paypal doesn't announce it to literally everyone in the entire world, instantly and openly. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 01:24:45
The third party is the marketplace administrators, they have incentive because they get sale fees and it makes their marketplace useful to resolve disputes properly and timely. 
They have to be trusted not to be in cahoots with the buyer or seller, as do all escrow agents, but at least they cannot take the funds outright. Makes it far more difficult to do anything obnoxious. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:39:42
Not exactly. I think it has some potential interesting applications with social power. Imagine if my business were sent a bitcoin directly from block  which would almost certainly be from Satoshi himself. That instantly would get my business tons of attention, potentially globally. 
That is an extreme example, but I think it carries over to other coins that are extremely old as well. 
But you bring up an interesting point, I'm sure there's some aspect about that as well.

I've probably been in bitcoin longer then you have, and I really do understand a lot of the mentality in this space -  and I promise your confidence in it is not really justified.

if you can't give a reason why immutable stateless money is valuable, but yet you keep talking to me as I repeatedly ask for an example... I can't help but think you do not know yourself - which makes sense, considering every real example you give it will also benefit from having privacy. 
Also, how many bitcoins do you own and what is your address and when did you get involved? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:25:39


Not really. I can't pay for items from walmart using bitcoin. 
It is especially untrue with cryptocurrencies as the person receiving payment can just send the buyer a shapeshift address which will automatic convert their payment to the currency they like. I do this all the time, as I only accept Monero as payment, but many people want to pay me in ethereaum or litecoin. 
such an act simultaneously raises the marketcap of the currency the vendor is accepting, while lowering the marketcap of the currency the buyer paid in. Such a thing will be even more dramatic when cross chain atomic swaps are possible and easily done. 


So, what is your evidence/observation that contradicts my model?

Cool! We can help the Australian government with their untraceable cash problem by paying in Bitcoin! By putting these $10,000 or larger transactions on a highly traceable public ledger, it will help fight tax avoidance and criminal enterprises.  
Yay public traceable ledgers. Helping to socialize our societies. :)
This is exactly the use case for Bitcoin - it isn't for small transactions like buying coffee. those don't matter and don't need to be announced to the world on a global scale. It's for these types of $10K+ transactions. 
Hopefully this law will help encourage the Australian government to embrace bitcoin! It is perfectly aligned with their goals after all.

Full email:
Over the past few months we have observed a sharp increase in the number of users making sales outside of CryptoThrift, presumably in order to avoid being charged fees.  This not only violates our Terms and Conditions and removes the protection of escrow, it is also a disrespectful abuse of the service we are providing.  We work hard to build a site where the crypto community can advertise, buy, and sell goods.  We do our best to provide excellent customer support, and put as much profit as we possibly can back into advertising and marketing to bring sellers and buyers together.  In the year since we launched CryptoThrift the team has never taken a penny for themselves. 
 
The number of transactions being made outside of the site is now so high that we have been forced to take action.  We cannot continue to provide the site for free for these people.  For the past month all account activity has been monitored and we have compiled a list of users that we suspect have made transactions via Skype or our personal message system to exchange payment addresses and products.  At this stage we have decided against taking action with these users individually, and instead will issue a warning to all users.  If you  are buying and selling outside of CryptoThrift to avoid paying fees, you will receive one warning.  If you continue to trade outside of the site,  your account will be banned and you will forfeit any money that you might have in escrow with us at that time. 
 
Please understand that we are a small start-up company and without the support of our users and the wider crypto community we will not survive.  We have already received some feedback that the number of confirmations required is one factor driving people to transact directly. As such, we have now reduced the number of network confirmations required to one for BTC and two for LTC, in order to complete your purchase.  Please let us know if you have any other suggestions to make using CryptoThrift a better experience and we will do our best to accommodate you. 
  
Thank you for your understanding, The CryptoThrift Team

It isn't decentralized, but since it is open source anyone anywhere can open their own bitwasp marketplace or choose which ones to use or to ignore, which is pretty much as decentralized as it can get, it's just all networked together like OpenBazaar. 
The marketplace essentially just acts as an arbitrator and optionally marketer for the sellers products, as well optionally worrying about ratings.
Many sellers don't want to mess hosting or marketing since it can seriously compromise their OpSec - this is partially why marketplaces exist. It is my current understanding that sellers on OpenBazaar have to host their own node continuously to be listed in the OB search engine. 
Security wise there is not really much difference...the risk is all the same as it involves three people; buyer, seller, and escrow agent and a rating system for each person. Obviously bitwasp users can use web of trusts, or the internal rating system, or a combination of both. 
The benefits of Bitwasp over OpenBazaar are the following:
1. Far easier for sellers to use, and easier for them to stay anonymous. Assuming they can find a marketplace that is willing to host their products. 
2. Since bitwasp can be modified on a per implementation basis, and isn't all together in a (decentralized) network changes can be made more easily as there is no need for consensus or compatibility. I believe this makes it easier for this software to be adapted towards its own Lyft, AirBNB, Freelance, or item specific marketplaces, have features like affiliate programs, force encryption or prevent it, etc. 
3. Finding escrow agents... with OB both the seller and buyer need to find a trusted escrow agent - with BW, if you are on the same marketplace that is already agreed upon. 
Really the advantages of OpenBazaar over Bitwasp is that if absolutely no marketplace will accept your items, and you don't want to run your own marketplace... OpenBazzaar is an option, assuming you can find a buyer and a an escrow agent who trust one another and themselves. 
Also OB is it's own "Google shopping" where all products are searchable. This short coming in bitwasp is already addressed by services such as Grams, Google Shopping and other search comparison websites. 
Really they both have a place but I think Bitwasp is a more complete package and more easily adaptable and easier for buyers and sellers to use.

Also, while it isn't immutable on the blockchain... you can still be punished for your actions. Not sure why you think it is important that the blockchain is immutable while it offers absolutely no protection to you. 
Personally, I'd rather be stopped from breaking the law, then having something facilitating me breaking the law while simultaneously announcing it to the entire world.

So two parties can control something, and then it is considered decentralized? Sure - but there are varying extents to what decentralized is and that is the bare minimum. You want as many people as possible, that are as hard to manipulate/control as possible. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:28:36
I think so! Internet is still required, but the vendor should be able to transmit their BTC address via NFC, you get the address with your phone, sign a transaction to that address and announce it to the network. 
But is that really any better than a QR code and seeing the address?
I can imagine an attack vector where someone is announcing a louder signal of their own BTC address and maybe you'd accidently send to that instread? I'm not totally sure if that would be an issue with NFC.

Good point. I forgot that religious beliefs don't oppress scientific research, or sexual minorities. :)
Also, and it may be entirely different from where you are - but from personal experience with Mormon churches in a small town, they only help those who are active in the church and are well liked within the church community. I certainly realize this might be the exception, but in a lot of ways the religious institutions I have experience with only really are helpful if you are active and pay tithing. 
This is also true for Geico or State Farm. 
But in reality, sure whatever I don't care if you're religious. I thought that it was just fun to comment such a thing and get this sort of reaction. It is dimly entertaining, I guess?

@_date: 2014-07-18 04:07:36
Also.. this was a fantastic idea. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:23:29
Yeah, a mutually assured destruction type of transaction like this would work but is more suited for a totally decentralized marketplace that is completely trustless. 
And even tthen it is a little difficult to get totally correct because in a perfect world it needs to be just as damaging to the buyer as it is the seller. However if the seller does send the item, or doesn't send the item that changes his risk entirely. 
Additionally even if the buyer received the item, with your method they are still going to approve the transaction because that gives them the least  loss as they get some of the money back. 
Its especially tricky if it is totally decentralized be a use then ratings become easy to cheat and essentially useless unless there is a Web of trust but that they doesn't help keep anonymity. 
I'm still looking into this and if I ever find it possible to get a good MAD payment system I'd work to implement such a thing as there is already a mostly functional decentralized marketplace that operates on top of bitmessage. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 03:11:00
I think it is in this case. Or it's a bit complicated: it's not about how many people own the asset, but how many would accept it as a payment, at which point that is basically just the reverse of graham's law, where the person recieving the payment dictates the medium in which they are paid. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:58:10

@_date: 2014-10-21 07:55:36
I used it before I thought it would make me rich. I didn't realize the real potential it had. I foolishly used it as a currency and so sorely wish I kept the hundreds of bitcoins I got from sales on bitmit and elsewhere. 
Anyway... I am holding it now until it either goes up in price or levels out. I still use it as a currency though, but not like I did. 
But I pay hosting and accept it for advertising and products.

The main factor is infrastructure. We need wallets with real features in them such as stealth addresses and proper multisig usage.  We need Lighthouse to be functional, and a whole lot of other stuff. That's the limiting factor that's stopping adoption. Not much else.

How is it guaranteed organic volume and velocity as opposed to other cryptocurrencies? You are claiming it is impossible for others to have the same guarantee? 
bitcoin is not as easy to use, it does not currently scale well, it is more expensive to spend, it's prices fluctuates wildly and many are completely public causing security and privacy issues. 
If its utility is not to subvert laws, and protect privacy/security, or hide information - then what possible use case does bitcoin have?
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:12:38
Also if I had the private key at which it originated, it would be valuable for potential forks. An early bitcoin like that has more bitcoiness to it, since it is more likely to be able to redeem the entirety of the "Bitcoin index fund" which is all of the forks of all time.

Nice. Sounds great. 
Okay next question: could reputation be faked by acting like a buyer, arbiter, and seller... Raising up high ratings for all.. (more so multiple buyers increasing the eating of both seller and arbiter) then scam people who see them as trust worthy? 
I'm asking not to be obnoxious, but this is also a bit of a problem with bitwasp, theoretically. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:09:09
Pretty soon (week or two?) Bitwasp will have it's updates released and it uses only 2/3 multisig transactions. 
The fact that it is free, open source, and has a lot of good features (PGP messaging, anonymous ratings, etc), relatively easy to setup and will be getting a decent amount of attention should hopefully lead to a massive increase of sites that sell using multisignatures. 
It would seem to me that the multisig feature is largely a two sided market problem - wallets aren't implementing it because there is no place to use it on other than one darknet website - and there is no place to use it because it isn't easy to use otherwise without the wallet. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:00:29

Okay. So, is being muted a common or big problem? Is it a problem at all? I can't really think of how that is a very good value proposition. 
Also, why are you concerned about people controlling your bitcoin if you are obeying all the laws, obeying all the end users policy, and not hiding any info? Is being muted in that situation a real issue?
Do you find it difficult to do transactions that everyone is in favor of? 
@_date: 2014-12-25 01:44:54

All miners are competing for the seem resource, the block reward. All other factors determine their fitness. The one that is the most fit and continues to reinvest profits into mining equipment will eventually take over and get every block reward. The only thing that stops this currently is a chaotic and changing enforcement, but as the price stabilizes and a few other things develop I suspect it will be a real problem. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 23:48:41
No idea, I guess that's a possibility. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:16:14
This. So many marketplaces come into existence with no fees (blujay.com, ecrater.com, etc) they all fail because they don't charge fess. 
Those fees are for marketing.. Not a coincidence those with high fees, like Amazon having up to 15% are also some of the most successful. 
Marketplace fees are totally fine, it's the transaction fees that are the main issue and where bitcoin saves the day. If you can save 3% in a transaction fee, you can afford better marketing giving you a real competitive advantage.

" how can we encourage more merchants to receive payments directly, and make it easier to do?"
Bitwasp is working on an open source marketplace that can just as well be used as a shop for individual merchants and will be using BIPs 10 and 38 (I believe) for multi sig escrow transactions. 
I think that will make a huge difference with addressing your concerns.

But really Bitwasp was in the works and existed way before Neo &amp; Bee.

@_date: 2014-04-04 01:46:44
Nope! How it works is this: 
Vendor, buyer, and escrow/marketplace generate three private keys, and they take the corresponding public keys to generate the address.. so These three public keys make the multisig address that the buyer sends the payment too - at which point no one can move those funds unless they get 2/3 signatures for that address. 
So there is no way the buyer could move funds without the permission of the vendor or the marketplace admin.

The thing about a decentralized currency and distributed community that anyone can join and participate in is that there is going to be a lot of disagreement, behavior and actions that some support and participate in while others do not within the group.

The $90 is how much the item cost, the addition price increase is payment for shipping. So if distributor 1 keeps it.. That's fine. So what? He paid for it. 
If distributor 1 is a cop, it's not known if the seller was the originating source or not. Think of it like a physical Tor network. 
Especially what happens if it's labeled as something legal, and that's all the distributor knows?

I think the general idea is that MDMA is more of an empathogen  than LSD, and that is really the main thing that makes it hard for people to work through PTSD, as they often shut down and freeze up when confronting and recalling the issues they are recalling and dealing with. 
I don't think there is enough studies to say that LSD is or isn't better than MDMA for treating PTSD, but I can imagine that MDMA certainly has a nice explanation needed for law makers to approve it, and from the little I have read it does sound like a better candidate in general. 
But I do not have PTSD, MDMA, or LSD.

We tried to rebrand it for PR reasons, but I like it since it shows kind of how I came up with the idea. 
TL;DR: There was a site called "The Hive" that was about clandestine chemistry. Users were called bees, they made "honey" and popularized the god for saken "swim" term that goes around the internet. Eventually another one came along called "The Vespiary" which is latin for  wasp nest -- obviously named as a sort of tribute to The Hive. 
The Vespiary in 2011 exposed me to bitcoin via the silkroad fiasco and eventually lead to me having this idea of an open source bitcoin marketplace. It seemed appropriate to continue the branding with bees, wasps, etc. :P
Probably just should have called it "Wasp Market" or something, because bit anything is annoying now days - but it wasn't as bad back in 2011/2012 :P

Well it's 2/3 signature - so it would require two people to vanish. 
Transactions can be performed off the site, so if the site goes down and the admin vanish - then hopefully the buyer and vendor are cooperative and finish the transaction - otherwise they'd get stuck at that point. 
But correct - Sheep Marketplace, Silkroad, etc none of that can happen with this, which is why we did multisig in the first place. :)

We'd help you setup a clearnet bitwasp marketplace if you'd like to launch your own airbnb. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:43:19
One question I have is how does the escrow work? Surely a trusted third party is needed? If that's the case, how is that any better than bitwasp? Which allows people to choose the trusted third party by using the marketplace of their choice. 
It seems like if it were decentralized both the seller and buyer would need to find a trusted agent for multisig. At that point, it's not much different security wise than bitwasp and might be a pain to find a seller with the products the buyer wants and also agrees to use and trusts the same escrow agent? 
While I absolutely love OpenBazaar and wanted something like this to exist for a long time, I honestly can't see what the advantages it offers over bitwasp. 
If you can, I'd like to see a fair MAD payment system. Where there is no trusted third party and if either party defects they both suffer. This is tricky and I can't find a solution to it as we can't know if it is the seller or buyer defecting. If it is the buyer then the seller would face nearly double the cost. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:30:58

@_date: 2014-09-18 00:20:23
I'm pretty skeptical of it. We looked into making a decentralized marketplace but I just don't see significant benefits over the issues it runs into, but I hope it succeeds. I think they have slightly different goals, and maybe they will somehow integrate somewhat. I really like the open bazaar creates stronger market pressures to be a better arbiter. 
Bitwasp is way further ahead than OB.. If you want we could do a little test transaction so you can see what it all does. It's really incredible how easy it is to use multisig!
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:33:13

You can only "own" a bitcoin if you have the private key, as that is what allows you to control it via spending. If multiple people have access to the private key, they all simultaneously own it. 
You cannot steal bitcoins, you can only take the secret info which is the private key. This might not be illegal, such as if you found a private key laying in the street. Accessing the secret info likely would be illegal, such as hacking into a computer.

complete competitors cannot coexist
The competitive exclusion principle is a proposition that states that two species (mining pools/miners) competing for the same resources (block rewards) cannot coexist if other ecological factors are constant. When one species has even the slightest advantage or edge over another then the one with the advantage will dominate in the long term. One of the two competitors will always overcome the other, leading to either the extinction of the competitor or an evolutionary or behavioral shift toward a different ecological niche. The principle has been paraphrased into the maxim "complete competitors cannot coexist"

I.E if one miner has the most reliable and cheapest shipping/source for ASICs and electricity and it allows him to be slightly more profitable than anyone else... then he could grow larger quicker than anyone else and will accidentally perform a 51% attack -- or rather, that will happen naturally and you just need to hope that they act rationally and do not go over 50% 
This will allow another competitor to do the same, and likely mining would become something like two exceptionally large pools, and possibly a small bit of altruistic/mining at a loss pools.

It's a strategy in the Rules for Radicals book by Saul Alinsky. 
Adherents of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals ( such as UNIONS, for example, are well versed in the use of ad hominem attacks on their opponents. They start with Alinsky’s Rule that states, “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)” The key phrase here is “irrelevant arguments,” which UNIONS have become quite adept at using to blind-side their opponents. They then go on to the Rule that states, “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.” UNION “leaders,” following Alinsky tactics, know that an opponent who is distracted by childish ridicule can become infuriated and then start arguing the other side’s case. And, lastly, the main goal of Saul Alinsky’s followers is to “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities. One is that the opposition must be singled out as the target and ‘frozen.’… When you ‘freeze the target,’ you disregard these [rational but distracting] arguments.
Alinsky’s tactics are laid out by these direct quotes from his book, as follows:
“Tactics are those conscious deliberate acts by which human beings live with each other and deal with the world around them. … Here our concern is with the tactic of taking; how the Have-Nots can take power away from the Haves.” p.126 
Always remember the first rule of power tactics (pps.127-134):
1. “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.”
2. “Never go outside the expertise of your people. When an action or tactic is outside the experience of the people, the result is confusion, fear and retreat…. [and] the collapse of communication.
3. “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)
4. “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules. You can kill them with this, for they can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity.”
5. “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.”
6. “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.”
7. “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Man can sustain militant interest in any issue for only a limited time….”
8. “Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose.”
9. “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.”
10. “The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition. It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.”
11. “If you push a negative hard and deep enough, it will break through into its counterside… every positive has its negative.”
12. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.”
13. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities. One is that the opposition must be singled out as the target and ‘frozen.’…
    “…any target can always say, ‘Why do you center on me when there are others to blame as well?’ When you ‘freeze the target,’ you disregard these [rational but distracting] arguments…. Then, as you zero in and freeze your target and carry out your attack, all the ‘others’ come out of the woodwork very soon. They become visible by their support of the target…’
    “One acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other.” (pps.127-134)

I used to use it for privacy related stuff, and where it was difficult to use a traditional payment processor: such as selling tobacco seeds, and other psychoactive substances. 
It no longer do use it though, as I think it is fundamentally broken for two reasons and it has no real utility. 
I think it is valuable/holding value because the market hasn't realized that it is not fungible, and cannot become fungible since it must be enforced on the base layer which is too much of a change to be accepted without forking and serious damage to many businesses that are built around it. 
Cryptocurrencies are not as easy to use, they do not scale well, they are more expensive to spend, their prices fluctuate wildly and many are completely public causing security and privacy issues.  
So what possible use case do they have? and which ones are the best?  
In regards to the issues mentioned above, traditional payment processors have cryptocurrencies beat. Credit Cards, PayPal, Facebook, and all of those allow for the near instant transactions of a fairly price stable currency with fees ranging from free to 2.8% + $0.30. These transactions are only visible to the payment processor, the end users and of course the government.  
Cryptocurrencies may be a decent competitor to international bank transfers that often cost $25 and can take days. However, this exposes you risk because they are so volatile, and USD to Crypto to EUR (or other) likely incurs fees that could cost as much as an international bank transfer.   
Cryptocurrencies are however revolutionary because they are decentralized, trustless and permissionless currencies.    
This isn't always useful, but there are some situations where it is extremely useful:   
When you are dealing with high risk transactions, being subversive, or disobeying governments.
While bitcoin is great at giving people the ability to transact how they please, it has at least one big issue: it is extremely brazen. Everyone in the world can see the quantity of bitcoin being sent, where it is being sent to, from and it's entire history. 
This is quite an odd combination of features; it facilitates you breaking the law but it also publicly announces it to the entire world. 
This is not some hypothetical issue either. It is well documented and happening all of the time. The MtGox coins were sent to BTC-E. We know this at least in part from analyzing the blockchain.

I agree. This is likely why it's so hard to find. The idea itself is a bit silly but I've got a pretty decent application for it which I think would be great, but due to its unpopularity and having no real keywords besides bitcoin, advertising, open source, etc I can't find it.

What does it offer over bitaddress.org? 
If I were you, I'd launch an .Onion site of it with https, and then do some good old fashioned fear mongering about exit nodes altering and spying on sites like bitaddress.org. 
You'd also be like the third to get an https site on Tor, which would be good promotion.

Adherents of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals ( such as UNIONS, for example, are well versed in the use of ad hominem attacks on their opponents.  They start with Alinsky’s Rule that states, “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)”  The key phrase here is “irrelevant arguments,” which UNIONS have become quite adept at using to blind-side their opponents.  They then go on to the Rule that states, “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.”  UNION “leaders,” following Alinsky tactics, know that an opponent who is distracted by childish ridicule can become infuriated and then start arguing the other side’s case.  And, lastly, the main goal of Saul Alinsky’s followers is to “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities. One is that the opposition must be singled out as the target and ‘frozen.’… When you ‘freeze the target,’ you disregard these [rational but distracting] arguments.
linsky’s tactics are laid out by these direct quotes from his book, as follows:
“Tactics are those conscious deliberate acts by which human beings live with each other and deal with the world around them. … Here our concern is with the tactic of taking; how the Have-Nots can take power away from the Haves.” p.126 
Always remember the first rule of power tactics (pps.127-134):
1. “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.”
2. “Never go outside the expertise of your people. When an action or tactic is outside the experience of the people, the result is confusion, fear and retreat…. [and] the collapse of communication.
3. “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)
4. “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules. You can kill them with this, for they can no more obey their own rules than the Christian church can live up to Christianity.”
5. “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.”
6. “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.”
7. “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Man can sustain militant interest in any issue for only a limited time….”
8. “Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose.”
9. “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.”
10. “The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition. It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.”
11. “If you push a negative hard and deep enough, it will break through into its counterside… every positive has its negative.”
12. “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.”
13. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities. One is that the opposition must be singled out as the target and ‘frozen.’…
    “…any target can always say, ‘Why do you center on me when there are others to blame as well?’ When you ‘freeze the target,’ you disregard these [rational but distracting] arguments…. Then, as you zero in and freeze your target and carry out your attack, all the ‘others’ come out of the woodwork very soon. They become visible by their support of the target…’
    “One acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other.” (pps.127-134)

Cool. I'm very interested in making multisig addresses for my coins. 
If you made it so the multsig were extremely friendly to paper wallets I think it'd be great. 
I'd love to use it if it had the redeem script, public key, private key, and 2/3 multsig pay to address all on one page that could be printed off. Three pages for each multsig. 
Basically make it like bitaddress.org in regard to the pretty "print" slip they give you but for multsig. I'd love that!

It's not really any better than the current model. It is worse because now it gives direct incentive to try to hack whatever you just sent it to: email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  
Not all of them have two factor or could be as secure as changetip could be made.  Not every account I use is on maximum security, since I never intend to have actual value sent into a DM message on my twitter, etc.  
Plus bitcoin isn't good at the micro transactions changetip is providing.  You incur two fees for every private key tip (one in, one out). 
If they don't keep the private key and the other person doesn't want it or figure out how to sweep it, they'll effectively be burnt coins.  
So TL:DR: It makes it super messy, less secure, still requires trust of changetip, has way higher transaction fees, more difficult, etc.

Bitwasp has given put a 2.7 BTC reward to someone for reporting an issue on how we generated random numbers. Thus was a little pointless since we changed to multisig shortly after to make I more secure for everyone. 
we're currently paying someone about that for redesigning our user interface. 
Bitcoin is many things to many people. So the biggest development for it in my own personal world is the launching of two marketplaces within a week.  which will shortly have around 15,000 products available via coinbase, and also  which will have multisig. 
Over all the biggest development lately is probably coinprism/colored coins. I really think that has lot of potential. Would love to issue stock in something like that eventually.

It's their fault for putting money into an expiremental, volatile currency that has no protection against theft, and then having someone else control it. It's a problem, but it's their problem and their decision. I haven't ever lost a bitcoin and I've been actively using it since 2011. I'm aware of the risks and understand the technology. For those who don't want to take on the risk then they are obviously welcome to use whatever other means they can find to transfer wealth or store value.

No it is not decentralized as each implementation of bitwasp is hosted on centralized servers. 
However since sellers can choose to sell on multiple marketplaces, and anyone can setup their own potentially unique implementation of bitwasp... that really is about as decentralized as it can get, right?
arguably the environment bitwasp marketplace implementations create is no more or less decentralized than OpenBazaar... it always comes down to trusting a third party arbiter for the transaction to proceed for both OB and BW.
BW deals with hosting as well, so that is an additional fault, but I am not convinced sellers want to mess around with hosting their own store-node for the sake of privacy/security or simply for the sake of specialization.

Everything everyone in the bitcoin community is working on; decentralized applications, sidechains, ETFs, dorian proxies like Purse.io, all of the open source infrastructure, the legal califcation, the use it has legally and illegally. 
At the end of the day all of it will factor into the price. :)
Best way to help increase the price is to help projects that are building free and open source infrastructure for bitcoin, as well as hoarding it yourself. :)

Bitwasp got some funding, but it was just a small amount and we'll be attempting to get more soon. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:20:59
Will do! I've yet to fully study openbazaar but if I can think of anyway to collaborate we'll certainly look into it . what would be really neat is to have openbazzar have an affiliate program that allows people to setup websites and market it. Openbazzar could become a decentralized and trustless e-commerce backbone that everyone taps into for ratings and advertising products. Imagine like seller posts minimum price but then affiliates can add in a percent which they get if they made the sale. That would be powerful stuff. :) 
How hard would it be to pose as an arbiter and seller to scam the buyer? That's really my primary concern with it. With a centralized marketplace this is also an issue but not  significant from what I've observed with the current marketplaces.

Well I assume most transactions wouldn't occur outside, only some.. As some buyers want the escrow protection, once a sale occurred it would be  futile to pay outside as they wouldn't save any money, but the buyer would be losing escrow protection.

This is going to be great for the under and unbanked - a lot of people have internet but not a bank, credit cards, or the option for things such as paypal. I expect this will really take hold in such locations very strongly. Plus it gives way more control over fees and refunds to the marketplace admins which is great - most marketplaces have to compete with the payment processor and fees can be pretty high. This way they can charge less and do more. :)
It's all very exciting to think about.

"AuctionWeb was founded in San Jose, California, on September 3, 1995, by French-born Iranian-American computer programmer Pierre Omidyar (born June 21, 1967) as part of a larger personal site that included, among other things, Omidyar's own tongue-in-cheek tribute to the Ebola virus.[8] One of the first items sold on AuctionWeb was a broken laser pointer for $14.83."

They should just charge every seller a certain fee per month if they make a sale. I.e $2.50 per month to have their listings  available if a sale is made. 
Seems like it would solve the problem. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:39:52
If the transaction can't be figured out between buyer and seller the admin steps to act as the mediator and escrow agent in since it is a 2/3 signature, just two people need to sign it - this prevents anyone entity from stealing the coins, unless they are colluding. 
the buyer, seller, and marketplace admin make up the 3 possible signatures for the transaction. 
However, it could be possible to make it 2/2 which would burn the coins, this is a bad idea though because it harms the buyer far worse than the vendor. 
Also yeah, we need to write up a bit more stuff, but here is some good info if you're interested:

What is the link to their marketplace?
@_date: 2014-09-03 00:02:00
Open Bazaar still uses escrow and the escrow users will take a fee no doubt. That doesn't really solve the problems faced with a good 2/3 multisignature marketplace. However open Bazaar does add in huge complexity, making it harder to use and higher risks from things such as sybil attacks, etc.

On some level I agree with your points, and surely the 10% is rather silly as bitcoin can lose that much in a day and often crowdfunding can take a month.  
The real key to this is that it is a huge stepping stone for Dominant Assurance Contracts, which are hardly talked about but they're undoubtedly the only thing that will make the bitcoin cryptoanarchist dream possibly succeed. 
Plus, like the video pointed out - some people don't have access to these types of crowdfunding services otherwise.  It's probably not a good idea to try to fund occulus rift with it, but there are certainly uses where it is better, such as funding bitwasp, OpenBazaar, and others.

The bitwasp code, which is a free and open source marketplace platform has just updated their code and has multisignature transactions for escrow. 
This basically means people can easily launch their own "bitmit" of sorts and not worry about being hacked and having user account funds stolen - not even by the administrator. centralized wallets are a thing of the past for marketplaces.

@_date: 2018-10-11 22:14:33
Ah, so if you buy drugs, and either the vendor or the marketplace gets raided, or if you bought it via coinbase or basically any other route, or if they can associate your transaction with a drug ID, which as by paying a fee to a known DNM address (or if they combine outputs from their multiple addresses) then there is risk of being traced directly. 
Sounds problematic. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:26:30
I doubt this. A Bitcoins history doesn't alter people's behavior or value or properties of specific bitcoins. I bet the distribution of criminal bitcoins used is evenly spread across all exchanges. Don't fall for this FUD! It's clearly just fodder to create the narrative that bitcoin isn't fungible or useful like cash. But bitcoin is the future cash!

Debatable, as a requirement for being a good currency, or a currency at all is that it must be fungible. 
@_date: 2019-06-13 23:52:02
But ultimately BTC is kind of in the middle ground in it's confusion. BSV has chosen to be regulated and obedient to government and Monero is at the other end where it provides absolute privacy/anonymity, at least as best as you can do it with trustlessness, etc. 
Not really sure the end utility of bitcoin. 
A store of value works fine and dandy but we got to remember in the future (soon, like 2040) it will largely only be secured by on chain fees. If it makes a shitty currency that doesn't subvert the government compared to something like monero, it will not be used much and become insecure. Insecure is very bad for "store of value" since it needs to be secure in order be stable and trust in it's existence for the future.
@_date: 2018-06-01 09:04:40

Think you meant to post this garbage in the BSV subreddit? 
Bitcoiners are lost; half think the traceability is a feature and the other half are excited for improved privacy from things like coinjoin, CT, etc. 
Most think since bitcoin is deflationary* it somehow makes the government go away or become more responsible: course they could just raise taxes by the 1% to 5% that inflation is occurring now and still get the same revenue. 
Of course, BTC isn't in a vaccuum so while it's monetary base can't be inflated, it's value can be lowered by competition from other coins or currencies, etc and it could lose value like an inflationary currency. 
If the point of bitcoin isn't to subvert the government and others who try to claim authority over others or to reduce one's own vulnerability to exploitation and targetting, then Bitcoin is entirely pointless. 
If it is the point, it is going the wrong away about it, and should be focusing on more privacy oriented features by default so it can actually be a fungible currency instead of a gold that requires a significant demand in transactions to keep it secure.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:07:35
And why is that?
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:05:55

Nah, bitcoin is in a deadzone. If you aren't worried about privacy; you use paypal. As a buyer, paypal is easier and offers you protection. Just enter your credit card and no worries. 
 If you are worried about privacy you use Monero. 
Bitcoin is potentially nice for sellers, but they don't seem to hold it or accept it much despite payment processing fees. This is probably because it is still more profitable to use paypal or whatever which is what all of their customers are using. 
It's sad, paypal sucks, bitcoin has some nice features, but honestly not sure it is ready to be used as a currency. That really creates issues since if it isn't used as a currency, it is only a speculative investment that is highly volatile and makes each transaction a fucking tax nightmare.

Silly question to ask in a subreddit that is focused on a currency who's price has gone up despite it's previous and current monetary base inflation rate.
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:35:16
Wouldn't it be creating a fee market?
A fee market would only exist if they were trying to get into a block but were rejected because of some scarcity, such as size - which this method provides. 
If someone did an attack that made the block size small, the fees would spike, and it would become profitable for people to push bigger blocks, raising the block size - eventually an equilibrium sets in where there is a fee, which offsets the risk of orphan blocks from larger sizes. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:55:33
I think someone would write and publish the code so that they could - if both btc and btx were simultaneously valuable. (which is decently likely). 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:26:23
Another great example is having your bitcoins frozen or rejected because you did a transaction for Kratom and its against coinbase terms of service, of they are associated with malware and shapeshift freezes the funds. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:38:13
yeah but you could just broadcast two different transactions at the same time on each one, and do it within your own addresses until you got them to separate, which would then allow you to control the coins independent of one another. You could broadcast it to more BTX or BTC clients to ensure that they did propagate through the two networks in your favor. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:43:16

Why does a blockchain need to continue to have additional transactions though?
Rai stones worked as  currency but they didn't get moved around, instead it was traded via oral history. This is a akin to the lightning network, isn't it? As it is just signing transactions that are valid but not moving the coins at that time. 
You can prove ownership of bitcoins without sending them anywhere, and lighting doesn't make any transactions until it is cashed out. So why do bitcoins really even need to move on the blockchain?

Wrong. Bitcoin does have stealth addresses, just no one uses them. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:49:48
Are throw away addresses practical to use? Wouldn't that result in a lot of dust transactions or otherwise potentially link all of your other transactions to other addresses?
Additionally, the transaction history of bitcoin is still there - if someone knows your address that is a liability, regardless how many times it was used. 
Plus, with the history of bitcoin you might get the funds frozen - this happened with that one cryptolocker guy who tried to use shapeshift for his bitcoin but shapeshift rejected/froze them because of the associated address.

Which wallet implemented BIP47?
I have been having a hell of a time understanding the utility of bitcoin lately. 
 I agree, the fee issue is a tricky one. Doesn't seem to have any effective feedback mechanism. It'll be especially fucked if second layer scaling solutions become super cheap and prevalent. 
I'm really not convinced the network can be secured without a block reward and off chain scaling solutions, as everyone will just use those and the fees the miners collect will be pretty small.

How does bitcoin protect people's privacy when all transactions are public and recorded indefinitely? At least cash doesn't have a transaction history. 
Am I misunderstanding something about Bitcoin? How else would coinbase have known I purchased kratom and then blocked my account?
Seems like not only can you be tracked from past transactions, but your future transactions can be tracked as well. 
I wonder if it would be possible to make a blockchain that was private? Maybe use something Stealth addresses, ring signatures,and RingCT? Use bulletproofs to make it so the transaction size isn't very big since they scale logrithamically instead of linear? 
Then maybe something like the CT variation published partially by Tim Ruffing that allows for logarithmic scaling of confidential ring signature transactions? 
Be so cool if there was a coin like that. 
That would probably be a coin that protects users privacy, but bitcoin doesn't yet. Maybe it'll integrate it? Would have to be by default since otherwise most people wouldn't use it and the anonymity set would be to small to be safe/practical.

@_date: 2018-04-16 05:49:46
That is my point... if you can't do big protocol changes with bitcoin, and it is not fungible, then it is in trouble. 
Also, about immutability: There is a documented case from 2010 when a block with 92 billion bitcoins was discovered. The bug was found and software was patched within 5 hours and everyone had to "hit the load button" to an earlier blockchain.
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:10:29
Right... 
ETH is immutable as well then, I suppose? 
After all: "try do that now"

What is the rating system like? Is it documented anywhere?
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:22:21
How do you modify a monero transaction, when you can't trace it? :) 
IMO bitcoin is more likely to be immutable because you can see exactly what is going on and can then adjust it. 
Also: bitcoin has already been muted/modified -- look up the overflow issue that generated like, several billion bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-07-22 04:21:04
The way it is written is confusing, but it doesn't rely on or assume a constant number of transactions. 
You could have far more transactions on the lightning network than would have existed otherwise, but if the number of transactions on the blockchain is low it'll result in progressively cheaper fees which result in less network security. 
If the transactions are free on the lightning network, why would many people use the blockchain, regardless of how many transactions are occurring?
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:48:59
Well, what he is saying is coherent, especially back when he said them. I don't think there's exactly great evidence for a secure blockchain that isn't emitting coin as a reward. 
That's one thing I rather like about Monero, it has a tail emission which removes this concern and results in a less deflationary currency -- which, maybe isn't desired for a digital "gold" like Bitcoin but for a transactional money/currency it seems like a net positive plus removes an unknown about future blockchains without rewards. 
It'd be really fun to somehow test a smaller bitcoin that has no reward, like some sort of testnet but with real value on it. Sadly I don't think that can be done.

I believe that lighthouse has a lot of potential, but it doesn't work very well currently; because unlike kickstarter no one can enforce rewards, and without the participants getting a reward they aren't going to donate. Dominant assurance contracts solve this problem and is a feature that Lighthouse needs. However, the interest and support for adding this feature to lighthouse is lacking. I am trying to launch a site that demonstrates the viability of dominant assurance contracts. This site will work to help fund free and open source software such as OpenBazaar, as well as help education the public about dominant assurance contracts, increasing demand for this feature in Lighthouse.

I don't, in fact that is why I like(d) bitcoin. This thread is really just to try and give me a reason why Bitcoin is better than Monero. IF its only purpose is to subvert authorities and escape the tyranny of the federal reserve, Monero is better being that it is more private/fungible/etc 
I didn't want to frame this thread that way because I'll get a lot of  accusations, but I've been into bitcoin since 2012 and no longer see it as what I thought it would be; though, I may misunderstand it. It may have another purpose beyond what I've already described. So far in this thread every use is either to be subversive OR it's stupid (looking at you, guy who uses the blockchain for food inventory in your fridge).

Cryptos are tools and they don't have to subvert the government, but like a hammer to drive a nail, they are extremely good tools for such a job, though they can be used for other things. 
I am asking, what are those other things?
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:56:09
Yeah I think an individual chain for each company with proof of stake would be a really nice option. 
If it were done that way, I don't see much or any disadvantage to doing it entirely separately from bitcoin. It would just be it's own coin with the power to vote, get dividends, and claim assets if the company ever liquidated or whatever. 
So, I think it might be best to base it on PPCoin and than review issues like if it should use sha256 for transactions or scrypt. I would think sha256 would need the best in this case since you'd probably want people to use ASCS on it? 
The tricky part is the voting and verification of active ownership and to send bitcoins as dividends. 
The BitStock would have to integrate somehow with bitcoin addresses. That seems like the most complicated problem of them all. 
Voting might be really difficult also esp. If you wanted to allow proxy voting.

Reducing a barrier to entry is solving a problem. 
 
And it is subversive to governments in that it is a tool to overcome government regulation such as amount of money exchanged, buying illicit goods and services, and so forth. If it enables disobeying the law, it is subversive to the government regardless if the government can use it or not.

I doubt it. Truck drivers have decent space up front (some have beds) and they often go 600+ miles in a day. This distributed crypto shipping service would be piggy backing on the fact they were going to drive various places anyway so no need to include gas, taxes, worker, etc... the truck driver would just pocket the money happily and tax free. 
Figure all of the truck drivers every where, along with people who commute quite the distance to and from work/school each day. 
Many small truck driving companies might be ecstatic to use this to help get a profit and competitive edge against bigger shippers. It might eventually even become logical for FedEx &amp; UPS to participate. 
Certainly would be for small local shipping services. 
Shipping would also likely be pretty fast: this would be anarchistic and so potentially operate on a 24/7 schedule and you can drive almost anywhere within the 48 states of the USA within 2 days and people may be willing to work for less than minimum wage. PLUS many packages could be shipped simultaneously making it profitable for the carriers and cheap for the person who is receiving/shipping the item. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:10:02
If the cost of the item is 1 BTC, make the shipper put up 1.5 BTC that they'll get back once the item is delivered. 
...It would work something along the lines of this: 
the seller, having sold a product gives the package to carrier A, who pays 100 to the original destination, and gets 110 back from carrier B, carrier B delivers pkg and gets 120 from final destination.
(The carriers need to put money in that they will get back to make it unprofitable to steal/not deliver the product - if the carrier defected, the money would obviously go to the buyer.. if it were 1.5X the value of the item shipped, everyone would want to cooperate) 
All of this would need to be so only Carrier B knew where to get the package (Carrier A), and where to drop it off (Carrier C) but not know anything else.
I'm seriously considering making this happen. 
Because if you have this shipping service in addition to two factor bitcoin transactions - which allows for buyers to safely buy from untrusted sellers ( you'd have a pretty fantastic use of bitcoin. 
Additionally, this shipping system I'm going to say would also allow for Lyft and AirBnb styled trades/transactions to happen fairly easily and distributed. Shipping would solve many problems the others would face: time, location, etc... 
Cyberpunk is now, if we make it. :)
@_date: 2013-07-26 11:57:17
I don't see any reason quantity of people matter here. They offered to do such a a project, said they needed a certain amount of money to make it happen and that was achieved. Who cares if it is from 6 people who really wanted to see it, or from 6000 who just kinda wanted to see it? 
@_date: 2013-06-23 12:03:24
After some thoughts, you'd want to have the value equal and not greater. This makes it unfavorable for anyone to try to cheat the system, as they wouldn't be able to profit. 
It would have to work something like this, or at least apply the same concepts:
"How do you make assuming potentially large risk (if you're shipping a laptop you'd need every intermediate to have $1000 or more to spare!) worth it?"
It would not be large risk. why would it be? your risk is simply delivering packages   from one point to another - not risky.
While it is true every intermediate would need to have cash equal to the value of the items, they would be making a profit, and they would get their money back AND be able to reuse the same money for future trips. Think of it this way: They are investing 1000 dollars to make $10 profit each time they pick up packages  commute as they go to and from work/school for many people that is 30+ miles each day in some places.
The investment would be a proof-of-stake and I believe this is to be the only way possible... the seemingly alternative is a rating system - the consequences of defecting is highly profitable (assuming it is anonymous and there is no proof of stake) and it would be easy to rejoin and scam again. 
You'll need to put up equal amount of value no matter what - and with my suggested system there is no need for a rating system which adds significant problems to the software - making it easier to track each carrier, and so on.
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:20:26
I mean it sounds like proof of stake will work, but I am not sure why this wouldn't be implemented now?

I am not the programmer and can't even program but the programmer said to expect an alpha release sometime in December. I believe this is when all the features will be implemented and functional, then we'd just need extremely rigorous testing. 
I think the best way to do that is to offer bitcoins for bounties of exploiting the open source software. I'm sure we'll put it up and tell everyone to try to hack it.

What makes you so sure that it wouldn't be as cheap or cost effective? 
Considering taxes, minimum wages, unions, the general bloat that comes about from large corporations, etc I think there is potential for it to be competitive. 
If it were competitive at all, many normal legal goods would be shipped through it. 
Lyft, airbnb and other related things are often cheaper than their economies of scale counterparts.

Value is subjective. Nothing has intrinsic value. There is no property of matter or law of physics that makes something valuable or not. 
Value is simply derived from supply and demand for the product or service.

For those of you who hate visiting facebook, I have uploaded the video here: 
"If you are interested in supporting the development of the BitWasp software, please visit our demo / test site, and consider sharing this video with your friends, and if you can afford it, donating to the following bitcoin address: 
There are three demo accounts, admin, vendor and buyer. The username, password, and message pins all the same for simplicity; admin, vendor and buyer. 
You may also create your own accounts which will automatically we filled with a small amount of testnet bitcoins so you can play around. 
Site: 
In the mean while, watch our quickly made video that goes through most of the features. 
... and remember, this is not finished. Not all the features are added nor is it as secure as it will be. We need time and then we need to really encourage people to help us find bugs once we're closer to finishing. 
Consider donating. 
Donations will go towards hosting, and to provide bounties for bugs.
If you can't donate, share our video. 
We're working on getting the new code up on github. This is not the same code that is currently on github. You've never seen this code before. 
Would love to hear your suggestions on wanted features.a

The moment I read this title I thought charity as well. 
I'd personally like to see it be a charity, such as  
They give grants to scientists to help cure mental disorders. 
One I am particularly upset about is PTSD since it tends to prey on people who were already victims. Which is absolutely bullshit. You get to relive that life changing event every single night in detail, you have flashbacks, panic and anxiety attacks, etc. 
1/5 vets (thanks, government) have PTSD and I believe for every 1 death on the battlefield, 25 suicides occur within the military because of PTSD and related depressed. 
It of course isn't just soldiers but 2/5 foster children have PTSD, and I believe women are more susceptible to getting it.  
~50 billion dollars is the estimated economic cost of PTSD alone. 
I like the idea of donating to something that attacks the root of a lot of problems, instead of just hacking at the branches. By funding scientific research to help cure PTSD, we help develop future cures that allow people to hold down jobs, prevent homelessness, and a whole slue of other issues. 
I really want to see something like this happen - it could make it so the bitcoin anniversary becomes a well known day of charity.

I have a friend in India who is trying to refund me close to $5K but it is really a pain since they can't easily buy bitcoin and money sending limits are $500 per week. 
Perhaps we can work something out where you sell him bitcoins for cash and then he can send them to me.

I don't sell or trade at all.
This is my philosophy: 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:23:16
 I suspect is going to be the best bitmit alternative. 
Bitcoins are never held on the marketplace as we use an escrow system that impalement an intermediary code with BIP10 and BIP38 allowing for two parties to use escrow without someone else needing to hold their funds. This effectively prevents thefts like that have occurred on Bitmit, Silkroad styled seizures, or Sheep market styled scams. 
Additionally the software is open source, and I believe bitwasp.co will act as an app store for the bitwasp software. 
I will be selling on there as well like I did on Bitmit. Expect a lot of tobacco seeds at excellent prices, heirloom tomato and other awesome seeds as well as some art, and  laboratory equipment such as water jet vacuum aspirators, mycology grow bags, etc.

APOD: Anonymous Physical Object Delivery
Abstract. Delivery of products bought online can violate consumers’ privacy,
although not in a straightforward way. In particular, delivery companies that have
contracted with a website know the company selling the product, as well as the
name and address of the online customer. To make matters worse, if the same
delivery company has contracted with many websites, aggregated information per
address may be used to profile customers’ transaction activities. In this paper, we
present a fair delivery service system with guaranteed customer anonymity and
merchant-customer unlinkability, with reasonable assumptions about the threat
.... read more of it, it discusses Tor and everything. This could be made to be distributed, anonymous, and powered by bitcoin.

No feedback. Maybe they think they can scam the escrow system. 
Although, to be fair I did once try to sell an iPad on bitmit that was brand new. I had won it in a link referral contest from a now debunked auction site (boocoo.com)

We're going to be doing something similar 
100% of the details haven't been worked out but however it is executed it won't mean the marketplace holds your BTC funds. 
And of course it's all open source so anyone should also be able to setup their own BTC Marketplace.

You are the first person to ever ask wtf or complain about the name. I named it and I agree with you. We actually tried to re-brand it last moment but we were stuck with it since it got huge attention overnight from the silkroad fiasco. 
But honestly I'm okay with the name I gave it. I've decided to brand things with wasps/vesp (Latin root for wasp) kinda like how there is a virgin Galactic, mobile, air, etc. 
Actually it's name comes about from this scary stuff: 
I like it because indeed it was partially inspired by The Hive. 
It's fun to kinda have it all tie together in a sort of blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:14:10
Assuming it is its own chain for each company... people selling stock/trading it for goods and services would pay a transaction fee - this would lead to the miners receiving the fee, and thus getting some of the companies stock for securing the network.
Proof of stake might be better than proof of work might be better in this situation if it isn't bitcoin. 
Obviously they wouldn't really be miners because 100% of the smart stock would be mined before hand by the company issuing it.

However, I have been following them on twitter, instagram and facebook and have really been enjoying the story as it unfolds and seeing what businesses are accepting them - but I am probably more enthusiastic about it than the typical bitcoin user.

A questionable idea, but it might be cool to ask the Dread Pirate Roberts of silkroad to publicly donate to such charities as a philantrophic effort. This would be a helpful thing for Silkroad as it has a lot of potential to give it a "We're here for good!" image, get it more attention (and thus customers?) and help it out compete those others like Atlantis. 
Surely that is the only reason he did the interview in the first place, right?
Seems like a good move on for Silkroad IMO. 
Someone should ask! :) 
Perhaps someone who frequents the site would do such a favor? :P

This is not an issue and the carriers are more than welcome to report it on their income tax. This system doesn't stop that at all. 


Just illustrative figures. The free market would decide shipping costs, obviously. 
If I had said 1.0 to 1.05 BTC it would also work. Distance, size, speed, and other factors all dictate shipping costs. 


This service doesn't need to be anonymous, it just needs the ability to be anonymous. It is up to the seller and buyer to decide to make it anonymous, and to what extent. 


Yes - locations would obviously be known, but they would not know if it were the original seller to carrier, carrier to carrier, carrier to buyer, or seller to buyer directly. 


Alternatively the buyer could get the package at the local storage facility and no one would know if he were a carrier taking it over the hills and far away to another warehouse or to his own house for personal use. 


No I am not! I assumed everyone involved was trying to steal the products, screw everyone over and make a profit for themselves. Tell me how to cheat my system and how it relies on trust. 


If the item is lost or ruined it is just thrown away by whatever party - likely the buyer. 


Private keys just get destroyed. By giving it to any charity, or organization around the parcel service you give huge incentives for those to make unsuccessful transactions since they will profit anyway, and gather all of the other money. 


The seller is out 20 BTC. The Buyer is out 16 BTC, and the carriers are out 10 to 15 BTC each. This is to ensure they do not defect and all have incentive to cooperate to their fullest and do the best job - additionally, it also makes the system cheat proof. 
 
"Seller gives product to Carrier A. It's worth 10BTC. Seller puts 10BTC into escrow for himself. He will only get this back once the buyer receives the product he ordered." 


Why are we assuming the carrier didn't damage the item? That would be an issue and you need to make sure each carrier *really* wants to avoid the item being damaged, lost, stolen, etc. 


Carriers would offer their services at the prices they were willing to work for - if a distribution chain were cheaper, the expensive carriers would not be able to ship the products and so they would not profit. 
Again, those figures were random and many things such as item size, weight, fragility, time, and distance all come into play. A carrier could be paid 0.05 BTC for taking it across the town, and someone could be paid much more for taking it across the state. The free market would set the prices. 
It may be better to design in like the TOR network in the way that warehouses are nodes, and carriers are simply the internet connection between nodes. 
Using GPG/PGP whatever signatures on the packages is what determines which node/warehouse it goes to from the previous warehouse. 
People would not know when or where the packages were or who they were going to - but this seems harder to make profitable for the carriers. the warehouses would undoubtedly also get paid for storage.

Holding increases value because it increases scarcity. Also you are actually "going without" since you are holding your money for the long term as opposed to spending it, so you are offering a service at a cost to your present self. Some people just go a step further. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 20:25:56

Thanks for your input. 
It seems like it may be the best option, a lot of people seem to suggest that it is but still the idea of my own personal VespCoin sounds very alluring. 
Additionally, I fear it would make trading them on exchanges more difficult. I.e imagine if BTC-E adopted VespCoin but it was also part of bitcoin. Would that become a real issue? or would it simplify things?

Glad you like it.
 We will also be adding in a BIP38 Two party escrow system like bit2factor.org does as an option so buyers and sellers won't ever need to have their funds on the site. 
That needs to become the standard. It's asinine that things like silkroad and sheep marketplace have such issues with theft when BIP38/two party escrow largely solves the problem.

Yes I think brand new chains would be better. Although, I could be wrong. 
I'd be interested in hearing why colored coins would be better. 
I think you'd want a separate and pretty significantly different chain/software that allows for voting, and dividends. I think those two features would be very difficult to do with bitcoin. 
Also, you would not want to pay dividends to bitcoin addresses that have lost keys. So you would want a way to verify active ownership. 
Think if you owned stock in a company that was paying dividends to lost wallets, which could otherwise be your money. 
Would make it more preferable to have such stock.

I've made nothing but profit on bitcoin. Sorry you've had a real bad time with them.

Correct! This is just new discussion between me (Cameron Ruggles) and the developer (Thomas Kerin). 
After that sheep marketplace issue and Silkroad we decided this was extremely important to stop doing that "all eggs in one basket" approach. I don't want to help create more thefts so by implementing  styled 2 party escrow we will hopefully be setting a new standard and anyone that uses the old escrow systems will be left in the dust. 
Ideally we'd be offering some sort of fancy decentralize P2P marketplace, but that's a little out of our skill set, so this is the next best thing we can do! :)
Although, that said I would love to be part of a decentralized marketplace. I've discussed it before with a few people, and with Open Transactions it seems like it might be a good possibility soon, but this will still be useful to many! :)

Oh! Nice. 
How can I join? 
I have things I wanna bash, and things I want to promote! :D

The software on those self checkout machines. Think about it! You just have to convince the software people to update to use a QR code and whatever in order to make it all happen so stores across the world accept bitcoin.

If it were just bitcoin alone... it would be hard to make it so everyone who used the TOR network would participate. You'd almost need an entirely different/separate network anyway... 
So might as well use bitcoin for that. 
But then again, that doesn't really help the "miners" or something?

It's not the biggest marketplace but when I used to sell there about a year and a half ago I really got some pretty good sales. 
I don't know how it is currently, but besides it being incredibly difficult to navigate, it's a really good alternative to eBay or Amazon.
