Happy to see this!
\(Wait, but in trade you can not rely on emotions...\)

I like such positive posts, it's always nice to read. I adhere to the same opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:31:56
Or maybe everything will stop and fall in one moment, who knows ...
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:41:49
This is strange, because the sphere of crypto currency is constantly developing. If this continues, then they (and everyone else) will simply have to accept this trend, otherwise they will simply turn out to be outsiders
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:49:50
What does it matter who said what? You can not predict movement. It can go either up or it may fall, or it may remain at the same level. the main thing is to understand that no one really knows. Therefore, you can only figure out how to benefit from any outcome.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:03:54
Any predictions about that?
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:20:34
Haha true
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:18:36
This is too much risk. If you really want to get a profit later, buy reliable bonds for one piece of money, and you can buy bitcoins for another. Think about it, I would do so.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:15:45
Haha it's so funny!Is this really in demand in everyday life?

Finally, this meme reached the crypto!
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:14:41
Maybe it's because of the hype. Or because of the calculations of companies to profit from these innovations.

Perfect wife

Wow, he is on style!
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:10:07
Support solved all my problems much faster. Maybe it's some special case.
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:04:33
Wow this is a considerable amount
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:09:33
This is not a fact by the way. You can not predict what will happen tomorrow
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:18:11
If bitcoin will grow up, they get a big profit, and if bitcoin falls, then on the contrary lose everything. It's pretty risky, but maybe the risk is justified, and they're not afraid of losing some of the money, given that they can get much more.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:45:54
Thanks for the useful information!
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:03:19
Agree with you, initially irrational move. Perhaps, if somehow this is modified, it will be justified.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:40:48
Oh, it looks like he have a beautiful life!
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:06:11
It looks like an advertising
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:49:15
I'm not against that. I'm just talking about minimizing risks and insuring myself.
Yes, it is possible that you will end up with less profits. But it's also possible that you will not lose all your money if something suddenly happens to bitcoin. I'm not saying that something will happen. This world is unpredictable and it is necessary to approach such things more carefully so as not to remain completely without anything.
But this is my opinion, I can be mistaken, because no one knows for sure, the most important thing is to think with your own head and understand the risks, and everything will be fine. Peace!

I farking love this car. It looks so cool, especially in black matte color
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:44:47
Like Batman's car

This is a pretty good film by the way (which is 2005)
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:02:45
It's normal when new thing replays old one. But I don't think that Dollar will come to end soon. This is a very well-established system and people at least for some time will use it.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:03:45
I agree with this. In fact, this topic is much deeper. About other spheres and other large systems is well written in the books of Nassim Taleb
@_date: 2018-04-11 07:47:30
Haha true
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:22:15
Agree with you. You can't predict how the bitcoin will behave. You can lose everything like a shot, still remain a debtor.
