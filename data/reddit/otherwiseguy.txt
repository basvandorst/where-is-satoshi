It being open source doesn't help you in this case anyway since the binary on the store doesn't have to be compiled directly from the source you can see in the repo. (And you can usually decompile the apk to look at the Java code anyway, though it's a bit difficult to follow).

The idea behind a dividend is that it is something you are owed due to prior investment. In this scenario, it would be deciding that all investment is worth paying a continuing return, not just capital investment. If your dad worked for 50 years laying brick that will last for a couple hundred years being used to produce more income, he gets some money back etc. It isn't just the guy that originally financed it that gets a return on said investment etc. And on such a large scale, trying to figure out what people "deserve" costs way more than just paying everyone. Keep in mind that it also replaces all entitlements.
Combine that with automation replacing lots of jobs over time and not wanting to live in a dystopian cyberpunk world where a few large corporations run everything, and UBI doesn't look like a bad alternative.

Is it stealing when a business gives a dividend to it's investors? What about if that dividend is inherited by the investors progeny? UBI can be seen as a dividend paid on the investment that all of our investors have made in bringing the world to the point we are now. The world has made some incredible advancement, and every family has contributed somewhere along the way, even if certain individuals in the tree haven't.

Not completely true. Let's say the word is something like my signature. Sure, it can be forged, but it won't be *authentic*. And music is easily copied, yet tons of people pay for it anyway. I'm not saying my word is copyrightable, I'm saying that the work that I create, the word, the paper being just so, etc. is unique, uncopyable because it's value is intrinsic to the work itself and the fact that I personally made it. The work itself might be copyrightable-as in making an exact repilica of the paper, my handwriting, etc. could violate copyright. People buy original art pieces and signatures and various pieces of paper with things written on them. The only real difference is that no one in their right mind would be interested in my particular unique piece of paper--despite it's scarcity. I.e. it has to have demand to have value--which is literally my only real point.

I've established a category, it's just that the category doesn't have any demand. The claim I was responding to specifically was talking about bitcoins, not cryptocurrency as a whole. With bitcoin there is clearly currently demand. If some other coin comes in and fills the category better, no matter how scarce the bitcoin is there wouldn't necessarily continue to be demand for bitcoins. To take it to a crazy extreme: if the governments of the world got together and decided to execute every single person who tried to spend a non-approved cryptocurrency, demand would most likely fall despite any scarcity.  If the underlying protocol for btc was found to be catastrophically flawed, same thing. All I am trying to say, however inartfully, is scarcity alone does not create demand and therefore does not create value. Don't assume solely based in the scarcity of a bitcoin that it cannot ever be worthless. Make educated decisions and gamble only with money you won't shoot yourself for losing.

I would like to introduce you to this thing called intellectual property and copyright. �� Hell, I don't even have to let anyone except the owner see what is written on it.

But no one cares about my paper, no matter how unique it is.

What a reasoned, insightful, and well-researched argument you have presented. Everybody should definitely just take your word for it. Because there has never been a situation where just being poor led to slavery, right? I mean, the kid of a billionaire who inherits a lot of money is just a dependent slave, right? They definitely couldn't use that money to make more money or anything.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:47:14
We aren't necessarily disagreeing. I'm just saying that the comment about bitcoins being a commodity in limited supply does not necessarily translate to the conclusion "it is unlikely to become worthless." Whether or not the conclusion is true, it takes far more than scarcity to create value.
There is a market for something that bitcoin does, at least right now. There could be other things that fill that market. The market could disappear or be regulated into obscurity. There are many many things they could happen that could completely tank the value of *bitcoin*. People who invest/gamble in bitcoin shouldn't lie to themselves about that possibility. It is a bet. We all think we have good reasons for believing the things we do. But we can all be wrong too.

I did read the "article" which was a tweet. I then looked up the charity and read their page [here]( where they talk about the studies in basic income that they are running, testing different models. The page that also links to some other studies on UBI. The page has so much more information than the "poor people are dumb and will just waste the money" reflexive bullshit that *some people* spew.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:12:53
Dude. The page I linked talks about them giving the money to every adult in like 40 villages. It's a pretty decent test. They are doing it in places that globally compare as poor because it is fucking cheaper to test there. But they are doing it on a large scale. Not just to the comparatively poor members of a community. Which one if us isn't reading and is making assumptions?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:47
The point is that limited supply without demand does not equal value. Just saying "there is a limited supply of bitcoins so they have to have value" is silly.

Ancestors. I meant ancestors. Basically, I'm saying that if you believe that all contributions to building a society could qualify for ongoing dividends, rather than just capital investment, then it would make sensr that societies that have flourished can pay a dividend to the progeny of the people who built said society just as companies that have gotten capital investment may pay dividends to their investors.
In any case, read For Us the Living by Robert Heinlein for an idea of the argument. It's not a very good story, as it seems mostly to be a fictionalized version of a thesis, complete with some character development done in footnotes. But it is an interesting insight into the ideas Heinlein was playing with before his career took off.

You realize that you can't do a test on the whole planet at once, right? There are comparatively poor and rich people in this area. They all get paid. Whether or not I make waaaay more than they do across an ocean doesn't really matter. UBI would be implemented at some level (village, town, city, state, country, whatever). Doing 40 villages in an area where it is cheaper to run the test seems like a decent way to test different models.

If you don't want to be quoted by a reporter, you don't talk to them. People living next door to a serial killer don't "deserve" to have their privacy disrupted either. They talk to the reporter, they get on the news.
People need to start realizing that public record IS PUBLIC and act accordingly if they want to avoid notice. That's a trade off of living in most societies. If security through obscurity isn't real security, then security through expecting people to politely avoid looking at things you don't want them to see is...well, pointless.

I'm saying that about people that call themselves PHP developers. Most competent developers I know can write pretty well in multiple languages. Almost all of the people I've ever met that primarily write PHP code have almost no understanding of computer science and write horrible spaghetti code. Your experience may be entirely different, but there are certainly other people who've noticed similar trends. You generally do not see the same thing when talking about people who primarily code in C, for instance. Sure you will find horribly written C, but generally the level of general knowledge (again, in my experience) is higher there. There are few languages that I've seen as much completely horribly designed code as I have seen with PHP. This includes very popular CMS software like Wordpress and Drupal.
Obviously one can write good PHP code--though I don't think the language particularly encourages it. I just don't think people generally do very often.

This is not correct. Mt. Gox's coins that they control belong to whoever the bankruptcy court decides they belong to. And the chance of them deciding that Gox can just keep the 100k coins that was their profit despite their outstanding debt is somewhere around zero.
Can Gox defy the court and spend them some other way? Sure. But for figuring out what percentage of coins are available for reparations, that isn't how you'd calculate it.

Whether it is a crypto-currency has nothing to do with the issue. If it was regular old dollar bills, it'd be the same thing.
Also, you are ignoring the context of the statement. Someone mentioned that there were 750k coins owed, and 200k coins available for repayment. Someone else replied that there were 850k coins owed and 150k available for repayment. I said that counting the 100k that Gox owned as not available for payment was incorrect, as they are clearly *available* for payment if Gox controls them.
Also, even if you completely ignore the fact that your argument is largely non sequitur, if you own something and I can take it by force by threatening something that you hold more valuable...say your life, then saying that you own the coins or cash doesn't mean much either. We live in societies and have to take into account the laws of said societies when determining what the word "own" or even "control" really means. Hence, the opinion of the court and the possible punishments resulting from going against what the court decrees would need to be taken into account.

But replying to the person directly that they were dumb to lose their coins isn't going to stop completely random people from making those mistakes. Anyone reading that kind of reply has already read the story of how the person lost their coins. The comment does not help fix any problem, it just makes the person feel worse.
There is a Sufi saying that basically goes like this: Words leaving the mouth should pass 3 gates, first the gate of truth, then the gate of necessity, and lastly the gate of kindness. While telling someone they were dumb for losing their life savings certainly passes the first gate, it is certainly unnecessary and not at all kind.


No, I really don't think you do. The warning is already inherent in the story.


Yes, because your feelings of irritation at having to hear about other peoples problems is right up there with someone who made a bad decision and lost their life savings. Have some perspective. Sure, many bad things happened with early adopters too. It is probably sickening thinking "oh fuck, if I'd only done or not done X, my coins would have been worth $ZILLIONS." But most of those situations don't result in said people losing their houses, etc. But either way, you won't see me telling them how stupid they were for messing up either...because it doesn't help anyone.
You're free to disagree with me. I'm free to think that to do so is insensitive and dickish. :)
DISCLAIMER: I have most likely lost about $15k (acutal USD, and a very significant amount to me, though it won't change my life) in the Gox debacle. I knew the risks as I bought the coins through bitcoinbuilder and don't expect or even deserve sympathy from anyone. With that said, anyone who would gloatingly tell me that I was a dumbass would be an asshole, even if they were entirely correct. :D

If the coins are transferred from one address to another, how exactly are you supposed to prove whether or not those were stolen or transferred manually for some other purpose? I can think of no way to distinguish, via the blockchain, whether they were stolen or just legitimately moved. It's not like you can make Mark prove that he doesn't have the keys to the address the coins currently sit in.

The story that the comment is on, including the context of the parent comment above it where presumably someone has mentioned that they lost all of their money, thereby giving someone the opportunity to be an ass to them. No one was talking about people making claims about bailouts in this thread. Go back up to the post I was replying to and look. He was specifically commenting about saying things similar to "wtf were you doing keeping your coins someplace like that" etc. to someone who just lost all of their money.
Sure if somebody is making some kind of claim like "bail me out!" presenting an argument why they shouldn't be bailed out is fine. I'm talking about directly telling someone who is letting off steam about how pissed they are about losing their life savings that they are retarded and should stop complaining.


Of course. But this isn't about people *being* idiots. This about telling people who have been through trauma after the fact that they are idiots. It serves no purpose.


You seem to be confusing me with someone who has ever asked for a bail out or to have risk eliminated or have in any way ever felt entitled to anything. I've lost plenty of money, but have never done anything but admit that I knew the risks.


You seem to be talking about a lot of things that I am not claiming. Again, warning someone is fine. You just don't happen to be warning anyone by ridiculing someone after trauma.


And again, I've never implied that people should get something they didn't earn. You sound like you have a pretty big chip on your shoulder and are putting a lot of words in my mouth. The whole "people were antagonistic to me, so I'm justified" thing doesn't really fly.


Again (and again), I get that. That's why I've never complained about losing money. You can treat people like adults, and also be nice at the same time. It's easy. The fact that I have to argue with someone that it is bad essentially teasing some hypothetical person who has undergone trauma is amazing to me. You don't have to feel sorry for someone to not directly be an asshole to them.
If someone is coming onto a public forum and advertising that they refuse to take responsibility for their actions, that's one thing. Calling someone an idiot because they fucked up and they know the fucked up? That's something else. Perhaps you can see the difference between:
"The people who lost money on Mt. Gox are idiots."
"Public Service Announcement: When you store your money with someone, make sure you can trust them." (Not that even that statement is really necessary with a story as big as Gox, but whatever)

Open source licenses all rely on copyright and the author always retains copyright unless specifically assigned to another entity.

This is a very different thing t than, say, filing a patent over the protocol (which you certainly can't do this late after publication).
