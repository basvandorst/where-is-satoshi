I don't really understand why everyone is so bent up about this.. I do not have any bitcoin anymore but I once did. It seems pretty simple to me.
Can we agree that bitcoin is not a real thing you can hold in your hand like a piece of wood, a pie or a dollar bill?
Yes, I think we can.
Can we agree that some infinites are larger than others?
between 0 and 1 there are infinite numbers, 0.1, 0.2, 0.11, 0.12, 0.111, 0.121 **It can go on forever** while between 0 and 10 there are 10x more yet still infinite.
I believe we can.
Can we agree that if today I say 1 piece of wood can be exchanged for one can of soda, that the wood is valued at one soda. If wood then 5 years from now became more valuable and now was able to be traded for 2 sodas it would be  then that one wood is valued the same as two sodas, so if you divided your wood in two you could have a soda per each half. 
You can not save world hunger by splitting a piece of pie a trillion times, because a pie will always be a pie. But if the value of bitcoins doubles then splitting the bitcoin should allow you to trade a half for the same as you once could trade a whole coin for.
I would like to hear a counter to this, as it is laid out here.

It was not dedicated to just one, just to those that seems to fill this sub.

Because people don't realize that digital coins are not pies :)

Thanks for the concise defeat :)

This is actually exactly my point, bitcoin only has so much value, as does any money. All money is a percentage of a whole, at any point in time, and many have values outside of themselves. They don't just decide to make more dollars, they make more dollars because there is more value to make them from. Just like shares in a company, they split when the value goes up, if it doubled in value then you have more shares that equal the same % but individually have the same value for trading as the shares before the value increase.
Since you posted to me, then to him :p

You make it sounds like the money is made with nothing backing it. All that is required for more bitcoin is bitcoin 2, bitcoin 3, bitcoin 4..

We are not pretending and I am not saying the quantity doubled. I am saying it takes half to buy X item, and therefor you have twice as much value and can use half the same as you used to be able to use a whole.

That is what he is saying, a cracker is only ever a cracker. If the cracker was a digital coin, and the coins value had doubled, you could split your coin and then have two halves with the same value that  a coin once had. These are unrelated videos.
