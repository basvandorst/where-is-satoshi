We are in Europe as the Canadians they are in USA. 
Anyway it's true, Switzerland has the so called crypto valley (Zug), where there are a lot of crypto company start-ups.  But none of these are cited on the article. Instead all cited company are strangers abusing the Swiss fiscal laws for their interests.

Yes, here my experience:
1. Develop something interesting on the cryptocurrency environment
2. Wait to get contacted from a jobs hiring person of a big exchange company ready to abuse you.
3. Refuse it

The solution is a Fiat backed by BTC

UBS means "Unione Banche Svizzere" (United Swiss Banks). Is one of the biggest credit institute of Switzerland. In the 2008 crisis was the symbol of the "to big to fail" meme.
But, as all others swiss banks, they don't blame bitcoin.
Opposite, they are working to innovate into cryptocurrency. Some associated banks like Credit Suisse already offers criypto investment packages. They are also working in a modern blockchain based protocol with the BNS (Swiss National Bank), to evolve their intra-banking transfers

It's a Swiss credit institute and investment bank. It operates worldwide, but it is not European.

It's not as simple as the article say. It's at the limit of a fake news.

I agree, first try in the next release 


When I get illuminated


This is a roll-back, first release was as you mean. Rolled back!


This is the easiest one, but the question is.. Why did not I think about this before?
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:02:21
Is based off bitfinex, but I can choose whitch one to use, data comes from [cryptowat.ch]( public API. Maybe in the future I will add an user option to choose the exchanger.
The tanks are the Orders, explosions are effective Trades and the line is the current BTC value


Yes, after a while of watching you can find out strategies that are not so obvious when are you look at a classic chart
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:07:41
\&gt;Care to ellaborate a bit? If an order is filled it explodes, if it is cancelled it just vanishes?
Yes, I have some ideas about, the problem is to understand when an order is filled or vanished
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:11:51
you are right, I'll put it in the next release.
In the meantime..

Reassure   Not true, if the total hash rate decrease, the difficulty decrease, the energy needed decrease, the safety remain the same.  
Reassure  My government (Swiss) recognize it and incentive companies that work whit it. I can also pay taxes with BTC. Please don't say that Switzerland is too little, remember that 25% of world's stock investments are in Switzerland  
Reassure  Can be worst, many banks are been bankrupt.
Reassure  Who ever dumped coin for fiat? 2017 low was 300$, 2018 low was 3000$, 10x more holders than the year before
Reassure  Money is the devile much before bitcoin born

1. You are right. If the hashing power lying offline and goes online in a coordinated way, and the hashing power is enough to rewrite the chain before the difficulty levels up. Anyway is a chain rewrite attack (the worst thing), not a fork that can happens any time someone change the rules and start mining coin with these rules (the original chain remains unaffected).

One day now and I don't know what I can tell you... probably "I love you"
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:05:21
