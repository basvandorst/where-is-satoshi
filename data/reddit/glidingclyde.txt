It's straight gambling, but only a few Bitcoiners admit it.  They are not buying Bitcoin because it's a new idea or what it stands for, they are buying it because they think the value is going up.  So people like Marc have to crow about it to keep the Pump and Dump going.
Bitcoin is a fascinating idea, but Bitcoiners are treating it like a Get Rich Quick Scheme, which will be its ultimate downfall because mainstream folks won't see it as a credible store of value.

Personally, I have a very poor understanding of security protocol.  I can cold storage my coins, but eventually I have to get them online to spend them.  That's where my weakness is.
I would trust a reputable third party to store my online coins over trying to secure them myself.  It would take a ton of effort to try and stay in front of the latest hacks/scams.  I've seen smart users get hacked, and I'm not a smart user.

How is it a guarantee if the vendor can simply ignore the customer?  The chargeback feature allows customers the security to get their money back if they are swindled or are unhappy.
I am not forced into sound business practices, it's just a good business practice.  If I don't like credit cards, I don't have to accept them.
The state is not forcing anyone to do anything in this case.  It has nothing to do with the state.

That's my point, The government of Argentina cannot control it's currency, as it trades on the black market for many times it's official rate.  The People give it it's value, regardless of what the government does.  And that country is a bedrock of stability compared to Bitcoin.
And if you think that Bitcoin would game prominence as a currency without some form of Capitol controls I have an enormous bridge to sell you.

As a merchant, I find the inability to reverse transactions a serious Bitcoin liability.  I like that my customers have the ability to do chargebacks if they feel they are warranted. It promotes trust and encourages new customers to try my business.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:58:45
But it's not that usable or accessible- to use and store Bitcoins you have to be very familiar with internet and computer security protocols and most people are not.
And the Bitcoin enthusiasts that say Bitcoin is the end of financial fraud are living in fantasy land.
It is a new and useful tool- but let's not get carried away.  It's got serious problems to overcome before it can ever be a viable currency that everyone can use with ease.

Sure you are.  All you have done is thrown another, incredibly volatile currency in the mix.  No one is going to settle a contract in Bitcoin when they have no idea what it's value will be day to say.  They have to tag it to another currency (Notice how even Bitcoiners express it in US dollars?) so what is the point of using it at all?

I am not on a fishing expedition.  I was having a legitimate discussion of the security concerns around the private key system where the owner is the only gatekeeper to funds.  It is a legitimate concern that the outcry of Satoshi highlighted.  
I like the idea of Bitcoin, it interests me which is why I am here.  Big ideas should have lots of critics - it make the system stronger in the long run.   I think that Bitcoiners will be better served to ditch the childish theatrics and name calling and engage on a more reasonable level.  
I do appreciate you responding to my questions.  Thank you.

Gotcha.  I'll keep watching.  I am fascinated - but still to be honest this idea doesn't seem new at all to me.  The architecture of it is new, and I find that interesting .  In the end, the Bitcoin still gets it's worth by a dollar conversion, which means it's just a proxy for it.  And it's terribly easy to duplicate - see Dodgecoin and the dozens likely to follow.  I'm not trying to be a hater, but it seems to me this is much ado about a centuries old idea , come to life in an altered form.

I may have phrased it poorly, but that seemed to be clear to everyone else but you.  
It seems we are in agreement though.  Bitcoin does not eliminate the need for a second party to securely store funds.  So although it took a long time, you did agree with me.

It's broke for you.  It works fine for me.

Or just using currency.  Property has never been a great way to buy stuff.
Its how we ended up with currency.

No.  Which is why claiming for certain it was one way or the other is stupid.

@_date: 2014-03-10 18:05:07
Good analysis.  I am a merchant and I will tell you why I don't use Bitcoin yet.  I don't know how to properly discount the transaction fees to account for the added risk of the new technology .
Sure the transaction fees are lower, but Bitcoins are nearly impossible to recover in the event of fraud or theft.  How much do I tack on to the processing fees to account for the higher risk?
I have not got a good answer for that yet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:57:02
It is difficult to understand in its entirety, which means mass adoption by normal folks is unlikely.

That's straight wisdom right there.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:56:14
When businesses complain about credit card fees I think they forgot they are gaining the opportunity to sell something to people who have no money.  What percentage of their sales goes to people with no cash available?
I bet it's more than the 3% merchant fee they are paying.
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:00:42
Money and emotion should never go together, but Bitcoiners are like moody teenagers.  That's the reason for the backlash.  The audience of this article was normal people who aren't as familiar with Bitcoin as folks here.  Plus they are a little sensitive about the "Bitcoin RIP" cover story the magazine will run in a few years.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:47:30
And you do realize that all those scams were the fault of fraudsters, not the currency itself.

I've been up all night with my two year old throwing up on me, so I am Redditing tired as I rock him.
That could account a little for my mood.  I don't mean to be rude, but as a person who likes Bitcoin but thinks it's currently being used as a get rich quick scheme, I am tired of valid criticism by like minded people being attacked and down voted, while the people who clearly don't know the difference between the Fed and the Treasury are celebrated.
This has become a circle jerk subreddit and that is unfortunate.

I nominate this for most childish Reddit thread of the day.

By getting it right you mean excluding all constructive criticism and you dismissing anything negative as them "not getting it".
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:48:58
Its simple.  You think being wrong = lying.
It doesn't.  I can be a journalist and door poor research and reach a bad conclusion without being a liar.  I just suck at my job.  
You have also made a mistake, which numerous people have pointed out.  You have offered no "proof" that the reporter is a liar, just a statement of denial that proves only that he is denying it.
So by your own reasoning, you are also a liar.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:11:12
Partially.  You really think the Bitcoin community won't start developing central authorities for its system?  A group that certifies Bitcoin exchanges, for example.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:52:29
You explanation of Bitcoin as a mechanism to transfer currencies, instead of a currency itself, makes a lot more sense to me.  Thank you.  Although won't there be cost to exchange to and from host currencies?
@_date: 2014-02-20 05:01:57
It seems that the shenanigans going on at the Bitcoin exchanges are worse than the Wall Street banks.  That seems to be a real problem.  What are your thoughts on that?
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:44:49
Newsweek has a Constitutional requirement to not print anything Bitcoiners don't like - which they violated.
Bitcoiners are worse than the GOP at bitching about the media.  It's getting really old.

I think we define "investment" differently, but we can both agree that Bitcoin and what it represents is fascinating.  I was in Grad school studying Finance during the economic crisis, which was quite fascinating from an academic perspective.  I kind of wish I was back in school now.  It would be fun to be studying this as it develops.

What are you are describing is a Value Added Tax, and it is quite common in Europe. We don't have it in the US.
In the US, you wouldn't have to pay taxes on the furniture until it was completed and sold.  This is the same for Bitcoin.  You don't have to pay taxes until you sell the Bitcoin for fiat, or spend the EARNINGS from the Bitcoin appreciation.

Wasn't Bitcoin used to fund a massive international organized crime syndicate and drug trade ?
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:26:25
It was very clear to every adult who read the piece that it was conjecture, and they were citing a chain of evidence that could mean that Dorian was involved.
It is also very clear to every intelligent person that a person claiming to have done or not done something does not establish fact.
If that were the case, the criminal justice system would be a lot more efficient and everyone would be not guilty.

AOL and Amazon were both actual companies with underlying assets and a revenue stream.  Bitcoin is a currency not an asset.  It is a representation of a good or service, not ownership of it.  That is why it's not an investment.
I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad, I am just saying it's not an investment.  I find Bitcoin fascinating, but a lot of these people seem to lack a basic understanding of finance.

I think that what bothers some folks is the assumption that people who think Bitcoin is a complicated, fraud prone solution to a non-existent  problem are just stupid and don't "get it".  Knowledgable people can disagree.
Not sharing in another persons opinion doesn't make them less intelligent .

Turn down the hyperoble, OP .  She may be wrong, but his denial is not proof of anything other than he is denying involvement.
To be lying, she would have to have known for a fact he was NOT involved , and printed otherwise.

If you really want to advance Bitcoin, Bitcoiners need to stop focusing on its value in US dollars and start focusing on its functionality.  The reason people like me have trouble taking you seriously is everyone on r/Bitcoin talks like rampant speculators instead of focusing on the solutions it provides.  I don't want any part of a Bitcoin due to its volatility, but I would be interested if it weren't being pumped as a venue for gambling.

So once you gain access to the private key, via robbery or force - you own those Bitcoins, right?  They cannot be retrieved or recalled?  Isn't this a massive incentive to target people who have Bitcoins over people who keep assets in the normal banking system?

So how do I, a small business owner with a website and business on the west coast, "earn the trust" of a potential customer from Detroit?  Do I have to fly out for a coffee date over a 12 dollar item?  Babysit their kids?
You obviously are not a business owner because nothing is or should be done by "trust".  It's done by contracts, verification, and accountability of both parties.
I've been doing business online for 10 years now and have had 2 fradualent transactions that I lost money on.  Of the 7 chargebacks I have received, I only lost 2 because I track shipping.

Yes, because customer reviews are never planted, made up, modified, or abused by competitors.

Buying Bitcoins is not an investment, it's a speculative play.  Its the same as trading coffee futures.  It has all the risks of normal speculations, plus the problem of sketchy exchanges that are likely undercapitalized.

It's because they understand that alternate currencies are not a new idea.  They see that Bitcoin is incredibly easy for the average person to have stolen or lose, and they think it can't become mainstream in its current form.  
They are most likely right.

He did admit his involvement initially.  It seemed like reasonable conjecture on her part.  I am not sure why R/Bitcoin went so berserk, but their behavior is starting to associate Bitcoin with basement dwelling internet trolls and not as financial innovators.
It seemed very clear in the article that it was a reasoned hypothesis, not a conclusion.

For a community that's all about open source, freedom of information, and financial freedom, you guys sure have turned into some censorship loving hypocrites.
If she could find this information, someone else could as well.  She didn't reveal his Bitcoin wealth.  We all knew that already.  All this info would have gone public soon anyway.

The store would not be taxed as they just received the Bitcoin.  If that .01 Bitcoin they received doubled in value and they sold it, they would owe capital gains.
Best way to not have to deal with this is to have them convert it to fiat immediately after the transaction occurs .
