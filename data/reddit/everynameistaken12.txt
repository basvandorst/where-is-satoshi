To be fair, a number of solid alt-coins are still fairing well. It's the coins that have been mindlessly hyped by McAffee et al that have suffered, along with the small, speculative coins that have no USPs

You win this thread 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:52:36
Thanks for the write up, very informative. Can you recommend any decent resources to learn more a out futures trading?
Also, do you think it's possible we'll see a lot more volume on existing futures exchanges such as BitMex which aren't cash settled?

I can't speak on strategy, but in terms of investment I've always found bitstamp easy and reliable.
Cheap if you are EU too

Futures should hopefully stabilize the price a bit. And as others have said, lightning will help with the currency side of the coin. That said, it's near impossible to forecast just how the introduction of futures will affect the price; I can't see it stabilizing until after a pretty severe correction, personally

In their defense, sometimes attempts at serious discussion get drowned in a HODL flood

The real question is whether it's still profitable enough to encourage enough miners that a 51% attack is still infeasible.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:51
Good job man. I did the exact same thing as a student last time this happened. I'm glad I sold half cause at the time I needed the cash, but I'm glad I kept half cause it's up from 50 bucks to 15k haha
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:10:20
Yeah that's a fair point, unless somebody comes up with a more efficient method
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:00:23
I've personally shorted as a hedge, and I wouldn't be surprised if others do the same. That in itself won't be enough to put any tangible negative pressure on the price though 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:15:01
The man is correct
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:17:10
Yeah I agree. The real question is whether the price will immediately begin a more healthy rise after the cor recruit due to increased exposure, or whether it'll bleed and stagnate for a couple of years like it has after past crashes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:37:33
To do that you need to set up a limit order

BitMex is a futures and options market for crypto.  With large financial institutions opening up bitcoin futures options in the near future, it makes sense that the exsiting crypto futures exchange is seeing more volume! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:37:22
It's possible smaller divisions could be added on top, like lightning is. No need for a hard fork necessarily! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:23:34
Yes, somewhere between a stock, a commodity and a currency
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:00:24
while most agree the long-term trend is up, bitcoin has a history of phases of intense excitement (like right now!), followed by a fall and more evenly tempered growth. So, it's likely that it will drop significantly in the near future. However, it is possible that the current push is due to implementations such as Lightening, so maybe it will have more staying power... 
A reasonable approach to investing right now would be to move some funds in slowly over the next week or two while watching the price. If it continues to rise then you won't lose out much, but if it plummets then you haven't gone all in.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:19:33
Most likely no immediate change one way or another, but the ability to short more easily will probably stabilise the swings a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:39:48
True! And, it might not happen. That said, it has had this hype cycle 4 or 5 times before, crashing pretty hard after this kind of spike. It's not certain, but caution is always good in investment, especially in something as volatile as crypto!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:05:50
As others have pointed out, it's hard to do with bitcoin due to transaction times and fees.
One exception would be if you already had both BTC and USD in both exchanges. If there was a big price gap, you could sell in one and buy the equivalent amount in the other to profit, and then even out the balance once the price gap had gone.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:23:35
It's very interesting seeing the range of responses you got to this! It would appear there's no consensus yet. For what it's worth, I'd *like* it to be cardano due to the rigorous nature of their research, but the reality is it'll most likely be whatever coin is in the right place at the right time 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:47:20
What's DBG?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:11
Yes, what Scarter said. So far, bitcoin exchanges have about a 30% chance of going bust or being hacked, which can lead to troubles withdrawing funds. While the exchanges are much more stable now than they initially were, they are still very much not 100% secure. If you have your coins in electrum, for example, you don't have to worry about any particular market experiencing troubles.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:07:36
As a european it seems fairly easy for me to get money into and out of, although I can't speak for Americans. Also the increased trade volume atm could be causing delays. Overall a decent exchange though; secure with low fees
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:39:10
Tbf people generally set sell orders at 1k intervals just for ease and psychological roundness. It could just be that? Unless it's huge amounts from single wallets 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:13:45
Could bitcoin provide that at some point? Quite possibly. Is it ready for it yet? Absolutely not. Transactions are still too expensive and slow, and it's still too complex for many every day people, especially baby boomers and older, to get involved. 
I certainly think the long term trend will still be upwards, but even a brief scroll down this subreddit is enough to see that the current rush is mainly pushed by emorion, which means a price correction is inevitable! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:17:32
This is pretty much my opinion as well. I love bitcoin for popularising and pioneering block chain technology, but I'm really not sure it's up to the job of long term commercial usage. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:21:03
That's not how the exchanges work. They don't set the price  (apart from tether), they are just a marketplace where people put buy and sell offers. The price is determined by the highest bid and the lowest ask. 
The difference between the exchanges has more to do with whether they allow American banks, transaction fees, and waiting times for deposits and withdrawals minimising arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:48
The BitStamp exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:50:08
Well, it'll make it less volatile. It allows negative price pressure more easily than before, though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:18:14
Got any sources on those stories? Sounds interesting 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:37:57
I agree with this for the most part, with the exception that the only trigger I can see for tether imploding is if a lot of people try to convert it back to USD all at once. So far only one attempt to convert a large amount had been made, and they flat out denied it.
So this means it *could* crash any time, but it could also keep building for a fair while first. As such I'm planning on only moving out slowly, while setting low stop sells in case of a flash crash, and keeping an eye on the tether and bitfinex news
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:03:43
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:27
It depends. A lot of people think it has some future potential as a genuine currency, due to the decentralised nature of the blockchain. While this is certainly possible, it is by no means certain that it will happen; it could end up being another crypto coin that takes this, or banks could start their own private blockchains. So, if you think that the world in general would benefit from this, then buying bitcoin can help progress it to that point!
Alternatively, it can be a cheap way to send money abroad; also with the upcoming lightening additions, many more stores are likely to start accepting it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:56:35
It's possible that the lightning network will make transactions much cheaper and easier! Hard to say though, certainly a big correction is due either way
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:14
I think you can do both, just set a separate stop and limit orders
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:03
I agree with this for the most part, but I think that the increased market cap and flow, along with the introduction of futures, could make the dip less severe this time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:52:45
I haven't personally used bitfinex but some people are worried with regard to their printing of tether. Binance have always been very good for me! As a side note, bittrex should definitely be avoided as they are notorious for freezing accounts and not allowing withdrawal
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:37:40
Sadly true :(
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:47:56
Yes, it's known as arbitrage
