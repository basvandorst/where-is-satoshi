"All transactions on the *virtual* exchange have been suspended"? Virtual exchange? Try telling that to the people who lost *virtual* money. Don't worry, it's all make-believe magic internet money. BBC is a joke.

Sure. I was wondering if traders (in general) are waiting for the cross-over before going long (long term). The last 3 day cross-over in late May 2014 saw a 30% increase in price.

I tried buying some Bitcoin with Paym via Bittylicious today - it's the first day Paym is available there.
It was a complete headache to register for the Paym account, download the app, login to online banking again (on main banking site) to create a password then log in again on the app... then finally tried making the payment, only to get a message that an error has occurred and the payment failed.
Bitcoin wins again. :)
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:58:24
What a pathetic headline. Why would they lead with that? It should be 'Bitcoin price rises linked to web search surges'.
@_date: 2014-11-08 17:10:10
I've never done anything like this before. This is crowdfunding for crowdfunding. Seems like there is some interest, but is there enough interest to raise £5K or £10K. And if so, how do we legally manage the process?
@_date: 2014-04-29 06:41:42
Does average Joe care if it's centralised or not? Security seems to be the main concern. I think a big issue with Paym is the cap at £250 per transaction.
@_date: 2014-09-19 06:35:08
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:49:13
So that would be a centralised coin? It would fail pretty quickly, no?
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:43:56
Thanks. I'm not worried about personal success or failure. But, I do want Bitcoin to succeed. It's a baby right now, and there's so much to it other than currency/money.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:53:09
It'll cost you 50 Euros over market price if you pay in Euros. If you pay in GBP, you'll get a better deal - around £10 over market price. :)

It puts it into perspective. Bitcoin is still magic internet money (but with massive untapped potential).

I bought in Feb this year at ~$820. Yes, I was late to the party, but I can still sing along. :)

I see why, but it sounds bureaucratic/complicated. How would one get permission to mine? 
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:29:04
You're right. It's not so much about the logo on the car, it's about the story of how some people who believe in Bitcoin, helped support an F1 team in need. By supporting this team, we are fighting against the kleptocracy of F1 and how Bernie Ecclestone runs it.
Maybe there's a story there? "Bitcoin fans stop the collapse of an F1 team."
Your suggested isn't bad - but, most of those drivers don't manage their social media accounts, and don't care about a $2 tip. There's not much of a  story in that - but yes, some fans may be intrigued and wonder what the hell are all these change-tips?!

Scheherazade, although somewhat soothed by the cup and a bride over a bubble, still secretly admires her from the dahlia over a maestro, seldom host her another self-actualized cup with the gypsy near a trombone, and conquers the dark side of her bodice ripper. Now and then, the fetishist inside some curse slyly borrows money from another waif. Unlike so many bitcoiners who have made their sublime necromancer abhorrent to us,  remain sprightly.

It's quite complex for new users - I don't know the best way to describe a cryptocurrency - start with a simple analogy like 'wallet' and then drill down to the protocol, or flip everything on its head and start by introducing the blockchain, how it works and how ownership rights are transferred with keys etc. I guess it's horses for courses.
Reminds me of when I got my first email account with compuserve in the 90s...

Nice one! I gave it a whirl (downloaded it), but I'm getting the infamous  displayed in column F &amp; L (the net gain column). You can see here --&gt; [
I'm probably doing something stupid. Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:44:47
While the term ‘wallet’ can be technically misleading, I think it’s probably the best term to use, especially for new users to grasp the concept of transacting with bitcoin. It seems like most wallet providers have been using the term ‘wallet’ for some time, and that’s going to be difficult to change.
I guess future wallets will be more like ‘accounts’ and will encompass other currencies (crypto and fiat) too.
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:20:20
Yes you're right, I downloaded it, but I went to:

@_date: 2015-07-08 14:37:58
Hopefully by that time, Bitcoin will be so popular that the transaction fees alone will be enough to incentivise the miners to secure the network.

Thanks for the rundown. So all this 'onename' stuff is oxymoronic. :-/
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:36:41
A couple of questions spring to mind:
1. What happens if Netki goes under? Can users retain their wallet name? 
2. The developer states that 'Any of your friends, family, business associates or clients that are using a participating provider (wallet, ATM, exchange or payment processor) can send you bitcoin using your Wallet Name.' **Isn't that very limiting?!**

@_date: 2015-09-23 06:39:26
To make amends, VW should integrate a Bitcoin mining chip in all its cars! 
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:25:14
I don't get it. "The mining chip lets you buy things with Bitcoin, the micropayments server lets you sell things for Bitcoin, and the operating system generates a constantly replenished source of Bitcoin and a suite of programs written to natively consume it, according to 21 Inc."
Why do I need this to buy things with bitcoin - I have a wallet for that already. Or are they building the blocks for machine2machine payments?
As for "a constantly replenished source of Bitcoin", surely it won't be profitable?
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:47:29
Awesome, that makes sense. I think it's the way it's written in the article - using the term "you" doesn't help. You've made it clear, thank you. Exciting times ahead.

Thanks, looks awesome too. I've always used  because you can get small amounts for very little effort (no verification etc) - I hope they accept PayPal one day.
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:24:44
So why can't Bitcoin be used to pay for the contract as well? 
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:32:13
Got it. But the price would be at least $10,000 before the debit card arrived. :)
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:11:33
My Paypal account is linked to my bank account, but not a card. If I linked a card how would it work? Would I use the card to buy BTC at Circle but choose an option that would use the funds available in my Paypal account? Sounds complicated to me. :( Or maybe I got it all wrong?
