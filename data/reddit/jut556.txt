"To be fair"
while that statement is true, you still need to utilize some more precise perspective by realizing that 6 years or so ago it didn't even exist yet, lest you loose the big picture.  also, realize that your ideas of currency have been shaped by government's needs, and doesn't necessarily reflect what it used to be for thousands of years in the form of scarce natural finite precious metals, now you come along, dictated to what currency is by your government for your entire life - that has an effect on your perception of things, and you can't deny it.  be extra careful when wielding that ambiguous loaded word for today its meaning is hijacked, owned, controlled, and spoon fed to everyone for all of everyone alive todays' lives (minus some African tribes maybe)  To reject the idea that perception of concepts and meanings of words are unnaturally modified is to say that you believe everything anyone tells you without question.
The value of this depends directly upon people's need for it.  The value of fiat depends directly on how effective the system is at controlling you with fiat.
The more it gets used the more stable it becomes, and more irrelevant non-money government-enforced fiat currency becomes.  I know what the right thing to do is, do you?

If you view bitcoin as an emerging market and not a bubble or ponzi scheme then you realize that it's now worth something when it used to be worth nothing, which isn't volatile.

very good

yup, a lot of sellout figures like Bill sellout Gates says the only ***problem*** with Bitcoin is that it's pseudo-anonymous
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:22:02
Hey state, just try stopping me from trading bitcoin in person for cash or vice versa, and unless you want me to realize that I'm a slave you better back off a bit because you're skirting the edge right now.

It's somewhere in between sometimes and the cost of the theft propagates to several different contexts of people.  
You could go with whatever form the monetary industrial complex currently is, such as the fiat currency and fractional reserve gambling process.
The current [business about internet connected computer privacy]( isn't about terrorism or pedophilia, but about allowing people to steal your digital assets, like cryptocurrency keys (money). 
Add a constitutional amendment to abolish suppression of speech through the use of information tools.
Either that, or we need to avoid using this technology for governing people, because we don't need a stronger monetary industrial complex.  we can't pick the future but we can invest in it, we can guide and design / steer the future.
dehumanization of technology:
But it could be undue fear, and CC would be awesome for mankind humanity, but nobody can rightly predict what would happen, say 500 years from now and what exclusive or major use of blockchain(s) would look like. Paper government issued IOU printed currency money might be deceptive and cronyism but at least it's controllable, who knows what would happen and for how long, in the distant future concerning cryptocurrency block-chains.  Humans should be in control, but how?  People aren't capable of competent and nonpartisan governing over other people, but they can govern themselves if [NAP]( is adopted.

the money industrial complex is the biggest one
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:49:16
agreed, morons like FEDERALRESERVECOIN can't see the forest for the trees.  A lot of staunch defenders of IP law are the same way, completely incapable of having a thought process and valid conclusion.
@_date: 2016-07-02 03:22:37
big cards are fear mongers and its cute.
I'm starting to agree with you that we kind of need to stay with the current money industrial complex as fraudulent as fractional reserve banking is, getting locked into some cryptocurrency black hole might be far worse.  humanity needs to continue to be in control of its own crappy system


it's the moving cup game except there's no pea under any cup and they're pick-pocketing you while you watch.

Why examine the speed of light compared to block propagation when transactions are basically modulated by the blocks?  I could see worrying about millisecond level delays but only if there weren't a giant whale of a number discovery and resource rationing/spam reducing system necessarily delaying transactions for 10-45 minutes each?
edit: re read your explanation and realized that you had already answered this question.  
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:12:04
Life doesn't halt/pause during predetermined segments of time, so why should money, or for that matter anything???  I've always thought it bizarre that people like having the world (and life)"modulated" to a 5 day work week with 2 weekends.

Do you also argue with someone for saying that it's raining when it's raining because they aren't a meteorologist?
because that's what you're doing right now.
ok, so it's a joke, not a very good one, stick to your day job

can someone eli5 this pleas

Doesn't want the attackers to have a lightning rod to zap at.  They can claim he's biased if he publicly discloses that he holds, and he knows it.  He would rather keep his ability to dismiss their bullshit and be taken seriously.
I would say "haters gonna hate", and "fuck the haters, do what you want".

the price of buying into the cc system goes up when the cc system has to pay out
therefore ultimately either way it's you who pays for theft and fraud regardless of who/what makes the immediate adjustment
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:48:01
and you're too inept to save or give, only the masters are proficient enough to do that kind of stuff for you.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:56:50


damn right it is, i agree
any system built atop a shit system is going to be shit.
the heart of the problem is that the money isn't money, but a convoluted idea that we've come to accept as money.
bitcoin and cc are the answers to the false system.

doublespeak nonsense

change from 0 to anything positive is an infinite proportional value increase.  Can't compare its growth with current selection of fiat currencies because they aren't new.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
edit:  maybe a better word is undefined, or a more specific type of infinity.  I believe division is required but the denominator can't be 0
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:43:09


in humanity, I'm sorry but it's pretentious and blind to claim the "money industry" is anything but a warm corpse getting colder...  humanity is not a synonym for banking
although it would be beneficial to prevent the death of corrupt and controllable money, as a runaway cryptocurrency might be far worse than bank bailouts - I'm afraid it may already be too late to do anything that would effectively stop what is happening right now.

deluded people who can't see the forest for the trees and that they are paying for what isn't security or protection, but their own costly prison caves of consumer-protection bullshit
When you empower the individual, you greatly bolster the group, when you try to empower the group, you weaken the individual and the group in return.
one hand gives while the other takes away, WHY CAN'T PEOPLE SEE THIS.
intellectual midgets and people with their heads up their proverbial buts make me sad, not the fact that "my team isn't winning"

a lot of people want to be told what to think, they want their games to manage their time, and to be able to sue the developers for "damages" the game causes them.  They don't want (or sometimes even understand) responsibly.  They don't want to have to admit... anything.
that's the failure.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:20:35
which makes it crazy when people like Bill Gates say the only ***problem*** with Bitcoin is that it's pseudo-anonymous
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:38:06
money's job is to reliably facilitate trade of goods or services, not "preserve its holder"

except you have no control over how much cost is passed to you, you can't negotiate the price of a product at a retail store.  nobody haggles with a wal-mart cashier ...
aside from the fact that you admit "your" fraud protection is a result of a flawed payment method built on a flawed version of money - and that the fraud your being protected from is possible because it's a flawed pre-internet payment method built atop a completely deceptive con job lie fiat currency.
I'm not surprised though.
