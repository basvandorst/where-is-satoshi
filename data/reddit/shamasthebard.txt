I went from 12.5 to 2.3 I learned the same lesson in a much harsher way.

Well the reason it's deflating is because there's a small money supply and while the percentage at which Bitcoin increases it's money supply is still huge, people still keep loading money into Bitcoin. There's just more value being added on to the Bitcoin at a faster rate than Bitcoin makes more supply. It's actually a lot more of a side effect of the economic value placed on Bitcoin and probably less of a planned thing because Bitcoin on principal is built with the idea of not being a centrally planned currency. 
Eventually when (if) Bitcoin and other cryptos are used as a primary source of money, Bitcoin will be pretty well saturated as far as it can go in terms of price and the purchasing power of it will just grow at the rate that humanity produces new value if we keep producing more value than we destroy. 
Deflation is great for the poor and an economy built on risk and savings. Instead of being an economy of managing debt, people would actually be putting their money into savings and get real interest rates again because of the actual risk of lending their money. Stocks won't be *as* powerful of an investment tool anymore but bonds and other forms of lending will grow in value a lot. Big business might suffer a bit but the average persons wealth will grow immensely.

I don't think it's actually going to get passed at all. Way dumber bills like this go through Congress all the time and get nowhere.
