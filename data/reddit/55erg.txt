Here's some balance: perhaps it never gets beyond the (present) security problem of normal people being able to sleep at night knowing their bitcoins are secure. So it may never reach mass adoption. 
In that scenario it still may become the de facto FX method for businesses (and banks?) who know what they're doing. 
There's a tipping point when the infrastructure is big enough to handle it, where it'll be more of a pain NOT to use bitcoin.

You're not an idiot. You made a decision based upon the information you had available to you at the time. 
Beating yourself up with the knowledge of hindsight is unhealthy and destructive. One course of action you could take is to sell it all now, sleep comfortably and revisit it in a few days' time. If you feel that it's still a wise investment, simply buy back in. Perhaps you'll buy back at a lower price than what you sold at. 
You can't be expected to think clearly and without emotion if you're nursing an open loss.
Don't listen to your friends.

When your granny can use Bitcoin to buy stuff online: that's the mass-adoption goal. 
So try explaining it to someone who has no interest in the complexity. Seriously, the questions raised by healthy scepticism and "normal" people are the most valid. Security, trust, privacy and so on. 
Until a big corporation embraces Bitcoin (Amazon, e.g.) there will not be the incentive for the average person to want to use Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin needs the same PR as visa, MasterCard and PayPal. Before that it needs a statesman-like figurehead to feed the journalists something other than MtGox.

Assuming your keys are encrypted, and backup up to multiple locations your top risks IMO would be (a) a lapse on your part, like leaving your computer unlocked; or (b) a breach by a clever virus, rootkit or keylogger. 
I don't agree that a paper wallet as cold storage is any safer than what you're doing. Bitcoin won't become widespread if regular people are keeping bits of paper in their home vault. Embrace crypto and use common sense. (+a good password manager).

Agree. I find their conversion rate better than getting my bank to convert first. I send as wire GBP. Their fx rate is always outdated and you'll only know what it is at the moment they receive your funds. 
From my experience based on dozens of deposits assume &lt;0.5% spot GBPUSD, but usually less.

Please stop comparing today's price to that of 1 year ago, 6 months ago whatever. It doesn't matter: price is a snapshot of the expected (future) value.
That expected value today reflects what the entire world Bitcoin will become, hence the reason that post-Gox, the price is holding up relatively well.
The lack of news regarding the MtGox situation is causing the steady downward drift.
Bitcoin has already evolved away from mining on gaming PCs with mom's electricity to enterprise-backed infrastructure. But the world has to decide: Is it a currency or a commodity? If it's another currency to be used primarily for FX it doesn't matter what the BTC/USD price is. $1 or $10,000 - it still works. If it's a scarce deflating commodity though, it'll rise exponentially and astronomically.

Congratulations and thanks for being transparent with your stats. Keep up the good work.

First, before you buy any Bitcoins, learn about wallet security. Decide whether you want to buy for a long term hold or just play money to spend at vendors that accept  Bitcoin. That will help you in deciding the way in which you'll store them. 
It's not just exchanges that can potentially rip you off: malware, phishing attacks, phone theft are all possibilities. Don't be put off by all this though, you only have to learn it once!

Agree. Use KeePass, not a service.
The Circle of Trust is then just you alone.  
Make your own service by keeping the encrypted KeePass file in the cloud on Dropbox or similar. Think of a phrase with &gt;100 characters for your password and you can rest easy knowing that it'll not be cracked. 
Or run KeePass off a thumbdrive.

I'd recommend [bitcoin.org]( to start with.
