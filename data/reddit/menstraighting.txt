Can anyone explain to me what the hell is going on?

Max Keiser and Russia Today: What's good for the goose is NOT good for the gander!
Russia: We want fairness in American currency NOT in ours...geesh.

It's early days.  I imagine there will be plenty more problems to come.

What is everyone going gaga over.  I have ZERO idea what the big deal is.

I buy hooker services all the time with bitcoin.

GoldCoin has a 51% protection algorithm.  Bitcoin devs should analyze that to see if it's any good and just use that.  Isn't that pretty much the point of the alts?  They can be viewed as a testbed.

He's really asking about protocol changes.

I'm serious.  I'm not trying to be rude.  I don't understand why this is news.  It's an app to sell shit with bitcoin.  This is what folks do now right?

I really don't think it's that much power anymore.  Has anyone done the math on asics vs gpus for power consumption.  
If you don't like it, you can always checkout NXT.

I've said it before, you folks should look at GoldCoin for a solution as the devs have implemented 51% protections.

The lead devs ultimately though they pretty much have to campaign the miners because it's the miners that will decide whether they want to upgrade to new code.

It's too bad this doesn't matter.  Apparently marketing and network effect trump technical merit.  GoldCoin is the only coin that has actually addressed the 51% problem and they have very little volume.  The developers are also apparently writing the client from scratch and have some other technical goodies to come but they SUCK ASS at marketing.

Libertarians are insane.  Just like any person that claims to represented wholly by any single group.  Maybe insane is the wrong word.  Perhaps automaton is better.

In 2048 $427,000 will be worth about 5 bucks in today's dollars.  What's the big deal?  Some guy was going to buy McDonald's with it?  Oh, McDonalds is illegal then.  I get it.

I don't even think this is technically accurate.  It should be titled, "a confused approach to how bitcoin works."
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:42:11
What the hell is happening?  I am so confused.  This just looks like a point of sale app.
Are you saying no one has done this?
I am totally confused and keep getting downvoted.  No one will tell me what is special here.  Seriously I need an ELI5.

This should be the top post.  This is simply the truth.
