@_date: 2016-03-15 10:27:23
Nice video, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2016-03-17 17:47:29
Only if I wake up and this happened, that's the problem, the rest will figured out.
@_date: 2016-03-18 15:31:23
Why just don't simple start using bitcoin for good.

@_date: 2016-03-13 21:11:24
I agree with this, tested and it works fine.
@_date: 2016-03-21 14:40:55
I think by time those questions will be resolved in a different way.
@_date: 2016-03-13 13:06:19
Excellent advice, I'm very satisfied with electrum.
@_date: 2016-03-21 11:59:34
Nice job, looking forward to try it.
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:35:08
Congrats, still using electrum wallet but that could change soon.
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:26:00
no, you'll just waste your time
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:37:30
Maybe we just need to be a little bit prepared for what is coming it will flow the way should be.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:51:23

@_date: 2016-03-14 14:15:48
How is this possible?
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:09:09
What's USAA?
@_date: 2016-03-21 15:36:16
This sound nice, smart contracts could help.
@_date: 2016-03-16 18:56:13
How this works, anybody try it?
@_date: 2016-03-17 13:26:51
Not so far, soon i guess.
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:06:08
I think it's 546 satoshi, but never tried.
@_date: 2016-03-15 15:04:05
Some interesting facts, but time will show if it'll be really this way. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 14:25:12
Maybe it's a permissions issue. Anyway if you don't use the config file have you tried deleting it?
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:31:01
I don't believe that you can find something like that, but I like your curiosity.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:12:39
I don't know that, thanks.
