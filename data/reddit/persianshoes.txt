The only exception is [PersianShoes]( coz the criminals have to buy them with Bitcoin and therefore their shoe-activities can be tracked.

Payment and refund is based on USD converted to BTC at the time of transaction

that is the whole point of this post. PayPal and Credit Card companies do not serve Iran. Therefore, the only option is Bitcoin. Both for us and for consumers.

These are hand-made shoes that are priced a lot higher in other stores.

Not really. In the beginning it creates a hype and a bit of sale but everything dies off after a bit.
At Persian Shoes we experienced just that. We have had 0 sale over the past 3 months. Might as well shut down the website and get rid of its maintenance fee.

I know one of them is in software business. Not sure about the other two. Didn't ask, didn't tell. Bitcoin was the catch phrase :)

What is the donation address?
@_date: 2014-01-19 00:32:27
At the moment we base everything in USD. So the refund will be the equivalent USD.

sure, will make an effort to contribute to the translation.

converting bitcoin to Rial is not a problem. There are people here who are willing to pay Rial to get bitcoin (not all of them through localbitcoins of course). We can also use  What we have decided recently is to hold onto our bitcoins because we think it is a store of value and it is a tiny amount of our sale at the moment, so bitcoin volatility is just a small risk that are willing to take.

No. Nothing publicly or otherwise whatsoever.

Our friends over at  are running a buy/sell bitcoin service. I beleive at the moment the liquidity is not enough to make a case for a fully fledged exchange.
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:37:00
It is in our FAQ section 
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:52:22
It is not. It is like receiving or returning from/to any other country. Fine pay $500+ and buy your local great shoes. No body is forcing you but you are deeply misinformed.

I take this as a nice joke!
If we could use bitpay or any western companies, we would have used PayPal or MasterCard and didn't have to wait this long to be able to get paid!
I know it is difficult for some people to believe, but it is physically impossible at the moment for a business in Iran to get paid by a customer overseas. Unless of course they use Bitcoin :)

This is the Sanctioned Entities List
And as you can see Persian Shoes in NOT among those entities. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:44:09
it has always been there
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:08:45
That's right. Sizes 40 to 44 are the most common. Other sizes are made to order. Please add a note in the checkout page (before the last step) with your measured size.
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:29:19
Your valid points taken and we will definitely consider them to change the website and add more info. 
We understand that with Bitcoin customers are at risk and we will try hard to convince people and stablish our brand.

Cool! Thanks for the video.
