In search of more answers. that's not very many options.

It'd be a start if someone gave a relevant answer instead of just downvoting, so yeah I think I wouldn't feel the need to post it if someone actually answered the question you know?

Yes downvote me, and upvote the guy who had a wrong assumption LOL.

I didn't, I got bitcoins for free by playing poker.

no it's really dumb if people are freaking out about it's value if it's a hassel to convert it to US dollar. I'd rather convert it to us dollar.

But they do on localbitcoins...

So with exchanges, I have to trust the buyer?
and with bitcoin vendors I have to trust the website?

So on bitstamp I'd have to send the buyer bitcoins before they sent me the money?

This site looks legit, do most exchange websites work like this or a lot of them do you have to trust the seller/buyer?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:40:21
But if a site like bitstamp manages all the real money transactions wouldn't it make it safe since you wouldn't have to trust people but only the website?

thanks for all the wonderful help lol

What I'm having trouble understanding is this: do all these sites require you to find another person to sell them to, and trust that person, or is there any website that just sends you cash in exchange for your bitcoins?
b/c I'd rather trust a website then a person.

that's one messed up bot?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:30:57
Thank you, anyone else have any other methods? and do exchanges use paypal?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:44:18

@_date: 2013-11-18 20:28:04
