Ballmer was excellent at running the enterprise Microsoft products, he just has no consumer vision.  He walked away with a shit ton of money for a reason.

Uhhh no, difficulty follows how many miners are online.  The difficulty has kept rising even though BTC is nowhere near it's ATH.
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:12:14
Mid 2018 still is not here.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:30:38
How is that any different than the stock market?
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:02:49
Spare me your rants you clearly know nothing about mining.  S9 turns on, hashrate goes up.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:46:06
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:48:43
Ya ok keep downplaying this behavior you zealot.  There's a reason BCH gets slammed far more than the other BTC forks.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:12:45
People in Zimbabwe don't "invest" in BTC they buy it because it's vastly more stable than their own currency.  Maybe do just a tiny bit of homework before you try to lecture someone.
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:58:34
How many of these are in the wild?  The S9 makes up the vast majority for mined BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:32:23


You need to watch some crypro 101 shit.  Paying someone directly in crypto is vastly different than using a cc or debit card.  You don't even get the basics lol.
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:35:17
lol wtf
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:17:02
There's a fuck ton of S9s distributed.  The only advantage one has is electricity costs.
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:40:57
Why are we comparing BTC to ETH?  Maybe get smart contracts on BTC and the comparison would matter?  I mean who confuses the purposes of each?
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:21:36
Ya cause throwing money away is smart...
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:05:47


I hold lots of coins and make trades based on how the liney thingy is moving on the charty doohicky.  I'm far from a zealot.  I rode BCH from $250 ish to over $2k last year and made a fuck ton, doesn't mean I respect BCH, shit is shilled by mad men who want you to think the coin is "The True Bitcoin".  Fucking nutty people.

I don't care it's not a real issue for me.  I'm not dumping Windows because a wallet that I'm never going to sync on a Windows box is slower.  Not a real fucking problem dude lol.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:08:56
Or I could just run a Windows VM and store the VHD on USB thumb drive with Bitlocker enabled.  Tails is for criminals and white hat wannabes I just need to secure my data.

Jesus dude learn to fucking look at patterns.  Bitcoin goes down then alts consolidate, bitcoin goes up then alts gain.  This has been happening for a long time and it's not going to change due to traders.  I hold a lot of BTC and alts, stop being a fucking zealot who can't look at charts and graphs.

The barriers are not low tech is just different from other traditional professions and the school system is terrible at grooming candidates.  I have no degree and work in tech but I started writing C++ at 13 and also began learning networking.  By the time I was 30 I had made it to a Sr role at a tech company off my own drive and passion alone.  The key:. Self awareness about tech and my career plus the ability to constantly learn and lab without people telling me I needed to do so.  4 years of college does not make you ready to work in IT or become a dev.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:17:56
How is BTC even comparable with coins like Sia, VET, Trac, ect where the tokens have more purpose than just being a store of value?  It's like you guys don't understand the block chain part.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:15:24
No it's not dude, read the STIGs.

 If all you know is how to click objects in AD sure but all you have to do is learn SCCM and powershell and you're pulling in 6 figures+.  There are more Windows admins because most businesses run Windows computers which means your sample data for salaries is going to be a lot wider than Linux, but you can still make a fuck ton of money in "wintel" (What year is this lol.) if you have solid scripting and automation skills.  That's the differentiation not Windows vs Linux it's automate and script vs not automate and script.

This is what real conservatism is about.  Republicans did not become weirdos until the religious nuts hijacked the party some time in the late 70s.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:16:04
Btrash is not an original project it's a fork of BTC, I hold over 30 different alts and at minimum $2-3K USD worth of my lowest invested coins.  I also have 14 ASIC miners screaming in my garage.  Call me a noob all you want but BCH is a fucking joke.  It's not a real project, and its certainly not Bitcoin.  You're a Zealot and it's not possible for people especially informed to take you seriously when you say BCH is Bitcoin, you're just a bunch of delusional idiots.

Crypto hacking is basic fucking scripts that hijack your clipboard and DNS, no one is writing malware that hijacks VMs and encrypted data.  The only sophisticated attacks like that are targeted.  I don't need luck when I have common fucking sense.

I'd say it has to do more with Bitmain only accepting bcash for awhile.  They forced all miners and resellers of miners to use it.

Those companies set the standards and it trickles down.  Automation and devops culture didn't start from the bottom.  Even if you don't work for a megacorp you still need to know Azure and AWS if you want to pull a high salary.  Your post is ignorant.

Less than 9% of women who are killed happens by strangers.  It's mostly from their boyfriends / husbands from cheating.

@_date: 2018-03-01 19:33:09
Gotcha, BITMAIN reported record numbers, they started taking BCH only when the price was still around $200.  I think they collected a fuck ton and dumped it all when it was well over $1000.
