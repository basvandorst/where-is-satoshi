Very good point here. Opened up my perspective a bit more.

Would you recommend moving my coins to something else that supports Segwit? If so - which wallet would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:02:03
Got it thanks!

One last question to annoy you...
I’ve used Coinbase in the past as my currency exchange. Since it doesn’t support Segwit - which exchange would you recommend? Are there any exchanges that support Segwit and have a phone app?

thank you for your reply :)
so if i understand it correctly - cold storage wallets like a trezor or keepkey, etc - when you use these physical devices and plug them into your computer and enter in your pin code - then these devices have your private key stored on them so they can access your wallet balance?
if this is the case - how does a paper wallet work?  i understand that your public key is given to you on your paper wallet - but where is your private key?

awesome - thanks for all of your help and the advice to create an offline wallet :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:55:30
Oh I see. Thanks for your help!

A keepkey

i have a question about how cold storage wallets actually work.
when you buy bitcoin from coinbase, then send that to your cold storage wallet, what is actually being sent to that wallet?  why is it that only that my specific cold storage wallet now has "access" to that bitcoin? 
thanks for your help :)

Thank you for your reply. I bought my cold storage wallet a couple of months ago. It is a legacy address. Is there anyway I can switch it to a Segwit address?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:11:53
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:31:06
How do I check if my cold storage wallet is using a Segwit address?

GDAX allows you to do this

Ah I see, thanks for the clarification.  So the main risk here is the possibility of coinbase itself going away or getting hacked.  That makes sense.
Is there any secure way to have an ongoing live portfolio, without having your actual currency stored through an exchange? That is what I like most about coinbase is that it shows my total portfolio value whenever I check it.

Ethereum is the only (popular) crypto that I don't have yet, I'll be considering that more for sure, but it confuses me far more than the others.  
Is the main reason why it is not more secure, is because of the potential of someone hacking my email accounts associated with my coinbase account, and getting into my account that way?  Or is the bigger security threat that coinbase in general might just go away one day, and possibly our crypto stored with them would go with it?

Ah I see - thanks for the help again! I might have to look into Electrum a bit more.  I wish there were more secure wallets like this that allowed you to see your portfolio while also being this secure with other cryptos as well.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:45:41
Cheers mate thanks for the info - will definitely look more into ethereum
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:28:01
i did as well.  got 1.0 BTC and a couple litecoins as well.  now make sure not to emotionally sell it if it gets high or low - its going to fluctuate like crazy but i'm in it for the long run.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:24:19
ah got it.  thanks for the clarification.  recently bought BTC and litecoin via coinbase, but still waiting for the transaction to clear and the bitcoins to be deposited.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:39:45
Ah I see. Thanks for the info!

How does the government go about doing this? Do they immediate convert the BTC to cash upon payment? I can’t imagine the government would want to hold onto BTC for too long without converting it to USD.
Is there a process where you can accept BTC and then instantly sell it for market value to receive USD?
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:38:23
just to clarify - you still have to use one of these exchanges for the initial transaction, correct? so the bitcoins will be hanging around there for a brief period.  then you have to move them from your wallet on the exchange to something like a hardware wallet?

litecoin was $2 back in 2013. It’s now almost $70. No frowns with those numbers...
