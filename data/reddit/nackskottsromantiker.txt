All ways of using passwords has disadvantages.
* If you use a password manager and a different uniquely generated password for everything, the point of failure is your personal password database and if someone is after YOU then you might get in trouble.
* If you don't use a password manager and use the same or just a few different passwords across all places then those places databases is the weak spot and you can get in trouble even if someone isn't after you personally.
* If you don't use a password manager but use a different unique password for everything anyway your brain is the weak spot as you run the risk of forgetting passwords.

Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT’S GOING DOWN I’M GONNA SELL he he he and then they’re like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY’RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I’m not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I’m already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU’RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying “OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD” YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

It does not matter what they say before the election, election promises are not contracts and you can't sue them when they do the opposite of what they promised.
Voting is basically BEGGING the politicians for some bread crums when they just stole your whole bread basket. DON'T VOTE, and tell others not to vote. It's the only way to keep yr dignity and it's a clear message that you won't put up with all this theft and violence in the name of the State.
