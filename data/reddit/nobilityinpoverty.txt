Adam I've been concerned for some time that Mike is a essentially a politician, albeit one with a technical background, who has been using political rhetoric and populist appeal to garner support for his proposal. Obviously this is dangerous--exemplified by the way he uses your question ("are you coming?") to instead criticize the entire consensus process as promoting "groupthink," when--if he had proposals with merit--it is quite obvious that he could show up and influence the discussion.  
  
Some of you guys who have had to go on the defensive for Bitcoin Core and the process it uses have seemingly backed off to some extent, perhaps because the issue has died down or maybe because you were taking so much undue criticism on these threads and in other forums. It's my hope, however, as someone who has really believed in bitcoin for years and has most of my money in it--that you stay adamant that the consensus process is best and that proposals such as the one Mike has outlined need to be stopped in their tracks (because they're really dangerous).  
  


  
I am as pro market as they come but in a complex field such as Bitcoin Core development this is wildly absurd. The only thing Bitcoin should focus on is maintaing/improving its security and reliability--**not** trying to over-optimize/be additive to everything in sight. the future is pretty clear and bitcoin should be a basic, but valuable and heavily mined settlement layer. Also, imagine the potential disaster of an automated voting process when, let's say, miners decide they're Janet Yellen and collude to vote for an increase in the 21mm cap. I don't think Mike accounts for sub-optimal edge cases when he projects an idea onto the future, which is exactly what you cannot have in this field.  
  


  
If we accept the future for the bitcoin blockchain I just described, the above statement becomes troubling (this is the entire divide, btw, not block size or review process but whether the future is ~everything on the single blockchain or an ecosystem of chains that revolve around bitcoin's blockchain). Mike wants something that works faster. He wants to get a bunch of industry people on board with an idea (because they largely can't fully estimate the implications) and push it through. He wants to do highly complex development by popular vote--how has popular vote worked out for selecting the best and brightest to governments in democracies around the world? Everyone has a say in bitcoin by choosing to participate or not. Anyone with the technical ability can present a BIP, and, if it has merit and is within the ethos of bitcoin, get it through. The fact is, there **are** a handful of experts who are qualified to pass judgement on proposed changes through a long, comprehensive process. Bitcoin development should remain the meritocracy it has become, not a popularity contest.

if you're going to make your argument on the basis of an anecdote from a bearish redditor, thats a tough way to start. yes, there is a legitimate reason to be in favor of raising the limit in some fashion, look at the data [on average blocksize](  
  
The fact is the situation is not as dire as you claim. In 2 years average block size has risen from .2Mb to .5Mb with an upper bound in August of .79Mb (not a sustained data point). Bitcoin's blockchain may not be as instant as some would like, but some inefficiencies are really an important security feature, which is why [the lightning network]( is such a key piece of the overall picture. theres great technology on the horizon that will allow individuals like that in your example to conduct these transactions largely off-chain.  
  
this is why rushing to a solution and implementing it off into infinity is reckless, IMO. the options available to us will change in the near future and necessitate far less on-chain transactions. furthermore, in the near term, as we are not yet actually hitting the limit, lets say this average blocksize chart I showed you exploded in the next six months and began running up against its 1Mb cap (a realistic worst case scenario given the long run trend of block size growth). What do you think would happen? Yes, you might be delayed withdrawing from your exchange if they don't want to pay a (still very low) transaction fee, but unnecessary spam transactions would drop out of the network too--it wouldn't necessarily be bad for a time. Solutions will be put in place soon, my view is just that we should be more patient.

TCP and IP are commonly used together but they're distinct protocols.  
  


  
this does not apply to the current implementation of bitcoin core coexisting with XT like you meant it to. it's not possible. when you throw out the idea of protocols speaking the same language--yes, different versions of a protocol can communicate if they're backwards compatible. bitcoin miners don't all run the same version of the code--some are late to update, some make their own modifications--but they're interoperable in part because constants like how big a block can be remain the same.  
  
the entire reason the XT discussion became so heated is that it would hard fork bitcoin as we know it and *not* be backwards compatible. there is no way to make it work. if they hypothetically were coexisting, and XT nodes mined 8 MB blocks, how could miners on 1 MB blocks reconcile the extra 7 MB of transactions? rules like this are critical to the consensus building process that is mining.  
  
but really the notion of having multiple implementations of the bitcoin protocol for *robustness* coming from Gavin is extremely rich. the man single handedly put bitcoin in the most fragile position it's ever been by threatening and actually making possible a contentious hard fork because he didn't get his way. the legitimate possibility of competing chains and loss of value for bitcoin holders certainly wasn't a move to make the network more robust.  
  
this is not to say that having multiple implementations of the protocol in different languages would be net negative--there are a series of libraries being built/maintained to facilitate this. but it's a very non-trivial endeavor and more importantly it's net impact on the robustness of the network is dramatically overstated. whats more important for "robustness" is a continued mandate that maintaining/improving the security of the network comes first. thankfully this seems to be the chief concern of the current core devs, we should all hope it remains that way.

I think you overestimate the extent to which bitcoin needs to change going forward, as do many people. Adding complexity to something that works as beautifully as bitcoin does already would be like saying we need to completely re-write IP and the routing protocols in use today because they aren't efficient enough. If you see the bigger picture of an ecosystem that grows around the central bitcoin blockchain it's quite possible to mostly leave bitcoin as is, have it be the "dumb" settlement layer, and let there be a diverse set of chains that leverage bitcoin but work in their own way. This is the true path towards decentralization.

wow, interesting. there's definitely a subset of people who come on here that aren't primarily concerned with the technological aspects of bitcoin and are prone to gravitating towards the idea of "hey internet money, must be the future, I'm in." I imagine these are the people that are so quick to support a relatively charismatic leader who shouts about how things must change *now* or the rise of your internet money could be crushed.

This matter wasn't/isn't actually urgent, though, which is why bitcoin can be scaled over time with a more reasonable approach

the killer app is doing everything an investment bank does within the bitcoin ecosystem, and further extending it to an individual level (i.e. marketplaces for personal loans, selling equity in oneself, "crowdfunding" a small business but with equity attached). bitcoin is to finance what the internet was to the dissemination of information and media

Yeah well Mike+Gavin live in an over-optimized alternate reality where the edge cases don't exist. The fact is that worldview is incompatible with bitcoin which is subject to the effects of gravity/real life like everything else. The day bitcoin is run by popular vote is the day I sell all of mine immediately, because it will cease to be any different than the money created by incompetent nations and even more incompetent collections of nations (lol Euro).  
  
Barack Obama received more donations from banks than the three previous US presidents combined. While Janet Yellen is the most powerful person in the world she's still an appointment of Obama--it's no wonder the Fed will never raise rates despite the catastrophic distortions it causes on asset prices, etc. Neither of them want a major recession on their record, and there's a serious vested interest who helped get Obama in office to begin with. Bitcoin absolutely cannot become this.  
  
Side note: there's a reason I leave bitcoin discussion to r/BitcoinMarkets where people are actually pretty civil and you don't get massively downvoted by XT sycophants if you say anything negative about the project or it's founders.

I don't think they created the website to "get traction, get funding, and tour the world doing presentations." Thats exactly what ethereum did, and since these guys are building an alternative to ethereum--presumably because they perceived it as a partially flawed project--they might just be learning from their mistakes and keeping things in house until they actually have a deliverable product. sort of like what 21 did (however you feel about them). of course they're going to have a website it's a decentralized, global smart contracts platform not a cupcake store on your street corner. And btw I think if you actually read the bios of the guys involved it's clear they have plenty of funding already in place.

gavin **DOES NOT** *get* bitcoin  
gavin **DOES NOT** *get* bitcoin  
gavin **DOES NOT** *get* bitcoin  
  
...  
  
the truth: he's the guy who followed THE GUY when an insanely small handful of people were familiar with bitcoin. since that time the project has grown and become more of a meritocracy (look at the core devs--despite what some say they still use consensus development and are open to great outside ideas). and yet somehow gavin andresen is still taken very seriously by almost all of the community, when it was excellent timing and not demonstrated work/ideas that propelled him into the place he's in now.  
  
I imagine gavin is a guy who never expected to be in a position of prominence like this, and his repeated affiliation with organizations that focus on title more than substance (bitcoin foundation), work with government agencies (blockchain alliance) when bitcoin was clearly created to circumvent these entities that have repeatedly failed us, all shows he was't prepared to handle it. ask yourself what other prominent current/one-time developer has repeatedly drawn this much attention to themselves, proposed changes that are antithetical to the spirit of bitcoin, and still been respected by the majority of the community. I find this stunning.

as much as some want to push XT through to increase block capacity *right now*, you can't talk about this proposal (now reality) without stating that it is nowhere near consensus--there are a significant amount of miners who've said they will not adopt it. so we can't say:  
  


  
because we have no way of knowing how a contentious hard fork will turn out. yes, maybe the transition would be really smooth, but there are a ton of edge cases you simply cannot ignore if you care about the value of the bitcoin you hold. I think it's irresponsible to talk about the potential of shifting to XT without near unanimous agreement without acknowledging the risks involved.
