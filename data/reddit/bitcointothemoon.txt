Multibit is what I use. It works great for me. Just back up your keys.

You are going to lose this case and he is going to win. You both have broken PayPal's terms of service. Even if you win a dispute, all he's got to do is chargeback. He will 100% win that. Cut your losses and just walk away. 
Never sell Bitcoins on eBay with PayPal or another method that can refunded.

Is a Bitcoin really worth 1k? Supply and demand.

Also: Would Google be exempt from AML since they are only storing data and not operating an exchange?

To add.. Your idea is great, just don't tag it to religion.

What's the exchange rate from bertcoins to bitcoins?

Just make it the Summer Solstice- June 21. That will give the corporations something to get behind. I'm sure they would love a "Christmas in July" sort of thing.

It's not a secret. It's been talked about before here as well as bitcointalk and a ton of other places. That's how I know.

If you use an exchange you will have to pay capital gains tax. No way around that. If you sell them off in small amounts for cash then you can get away with not having to pay taxes. 
I would like to buy some from you paying with cash in the mail and using escrow service.

G.I. JOE!!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:55:02
It depends on how you want to get the cash. If you want cash in the mail, I would buy some from you. What rate are you selling at right now?
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:19:05
You shut your whorish mouth with that language!

The sad thing is, if you want your money back, and I don't recommend you do this, but you could turn around and do this right back to someone else. eBay and PayPal won't do a thing about it.

Title of post is highly misleading. It is simply not true. Down you go!

He could post information on where we could donate Bitcoins to one of the charities he supports!
