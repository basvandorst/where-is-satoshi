What the fuck is bitcoin's value if nobody ever uses it?

If it's not going to be used for everyday transactions, why the hell is it worth so much?

The currency is designed to be deflationary. At some point in the very far future, there will never be any new bitcoins made, while the number of bitcoins that exist on the market will continually decrease due to things like hard drives being corrupted or people forgetting their passwords. All this means that after, say, 2050, one can reliably expect a bitcoin to be worth more tomorrow than it is worth today. This is good, right? Wrong. This is because of what we use currency for. If I'm a bitcoin lender, I will be substantially less likely to lend out my bitcoin if I know it'll make me money if I do nothing (this as opposed to an inflationary currency that would incentivize lending). What this would do is put upward pressure on interest rates, reducing the number of people who can buy expensive things - fewer people can buy a house at 3% interest than at 1% interest. This permanently hamstrings output and is a problem that can't really be solved. But it isn't even the biggest problem. 
Volatility is always going to be an issue for bitcoin. Sure, we won't see the insane fluctuations in price we see now, but the total lack of a regulatory body like the federal reserve means that the price will always be subject only to market swings - there is no force in place to control the market price. This will, by definition, increase volatility. What this will do is, in conjunction with inflation, further disincentivize lending and raise interest rates. Think about it - if I'm a potential moneylender, why would I lend out my money when there's an equal chance it'll be worth +/-20% compared to other cryptocurrencies a year from now? Uncertainty about interest rates creates skittish activity and depresses an economy. Only this depression would be permanent, because there is no Paul Volcker to step in and save the day. I don't have the tools to say the magnitude of what would happen, but it nevertheless provides a major obstacle to its adoption - what government would knowingly adopt a currency that would permanently depress output and additionally removed their regulatory authority?
I believe the above to be nearly insurmountable problems for bitcoin as a currency of the future. They aren't necessarily indictments of crypto as a whole, but they highlight the fundamental problems of bitcoin that are, by design, nearly unfixable. All in all, I don't see bitcoin ever approaching the extremely optimistic guesses people have for its long-term value.

It is a massive bubble, and I say this as a btc owner. The currency will never solve its issues with deflation and volatility that will, on a fundamental level, prevent it from ever forming the basis for a modern economy. 
That said, in the short-to-medium-term, it's a good investment. This is a very risky market. Nobody knows why it's worth $4000. They only know that it will keep going up. This market is the blind leading the blind and a recipe for a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:27:35
I mean, you don't have to look further than this comment section or twitter to see that a whole lot of people expect the price of bitcoin to be 250,000 a coin in the future. The returns people are expecting on BTC are massive, and the higher the expected future returns, the higher such speculation will drive the price up. 
All I'm saying is the current price of a bitcoin isn't based on what people think it's worth now, but almost exclusively based on what they think it will be worth in the future. I could tell you why people think Apple stock is worth what it is, and I don't even own it, but vanishingly few people know what it is about bitcoin that makes it worth 4000 a coin today. In my experience, this is a recipe for a bubble.

A significant percentage of the current price is where it is because people think it's *the* currency of the future - if it turns out it isn't, how much will people value it then? I can't imagine that it's higher than $4000 a coin.

The point that I think you're missing here is that no matter what the price of a house is, interest rates will always be higher in a deflationary currency than under USD. This can be pretty simply derived from the laws of opportunity costs. This will always depress output, because there will always be fewer people willing to pay a certain interest rate than a lower interest rate. It might not put a huge dent in output, but it will be a permanent structural deficit of BTC. 
No amount of fin tech will change the laws of supply and demand and the laws of marginal cost and marginal benefit. If the opportunity cost of holding money decreases, less money will be lent out. I'm not sure we can have a real conversation unless you accept that sentence as fact.

How many miners have a vested interest in making sure bitcoin stays deflationary? Relying on the miners to decide to make it inflationary at a certain point in the future is banking on them taking an action that, while it might be good for the currency as a whole, will be pretty bad for their bottom lines. I'm not sure we can bank on the altruism of miners here.

Elucidate this for me, then, Mr. Actual Bitcoiner. Why is bitcoin worth $4000 a coin, and not $3000 or $5000? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:31:13
I never said crypto is a bubble - I'm just saying there are specific structural deficiencies in bitcoin that don't necessarily exist in other cryptocurrencies that mean its value probably isn't $4000 a coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:03:28
What are they? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:28:36
That is not at all what Gresham's law states
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:55:59
Both supply and demand affect prices. The price of a commodity is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. You're right, if someone was willing to pay infinite money for bitcoin because supply was so restricted, it would be worth infinite money. But if someone was willing to pay infinite money for bitcoin, no matter how much supply was, that person would keep buying infinite bitcoin and the price would rise to infinity as well.
The reason this is all confusing is because a bitcoin has no actual value. If could take a poll of everyone on this subreddit as to what they think a bitcoin will be worth in 50 years, I don't think I'd hear a single answer between 10 and 100000. A bitcoin is a lottery ticket that it will one day be worth a lot, not an actual currency you would finance a mortgage with.

That isn't what "good money" is in relation to Gresham's law. Good money is whichever currency has a higher face value. The face value of a couple lines of computer code is functionally zero.
That aside, the fact that people don't spend bitcoin doesn't make it "good money", it makes it fucking useless.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:19:38
Tell me what the face value of a bitcoin is again? Just because you consider bitcoin to be good money doesn't make it good money under Gresham's law.

The relevant effects of inflation are its effects on prices stop obfuscating
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:22:48
Gold actually didn't work well. Inflation was extremely unpredictable, which scared off investment - if I could tell you with absolute certainty that inflation would be 2% for the next 10 years, that would make a business feel much more secure in its investments than if I said "you'll have an expected inflation of 0% plus or minus like 20% just over the next year". You'd be a fool to heavily invest in capital in the second situation. There's a reason nobody uses the gold standard.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:08:37
We're interested in inflation because of what the price changes it leads to do to consumption. There is barely any consumption using BTC going on (and, like this post says, there might never be), so for now measuring price inflation in BTC is a fool's errand.
