I understand the basic concepts behind bitcoin and blockchain but still confused about the process after purchasing the bitcoin. 
My basic understanding is that I can create an account on Coinbase, buy some bitcoin with my credit card or bank transfer but then what? I know it's not recommended that I keep everything in Coinbase since it could be easily hacked so what should I do? I know I can buy a software wallet but since I'm just starting out, I would prefer a paper wallet. 
This paper wallet is basically the unique identifier code that only I should have access to, correct? Since it's essentially the key to my wallet with all the bitcoins. So with that in mind, if I buy some bitcoin on Coinbase, how do I transfer it to my unique wallet code? How does one even obtain this code?

So if I'm starting out and want to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin, would you suggest that I go through Coinbase? I would also like to understand more what transferring the bitcoin out of Coinbase entails. How do I get it from Coinbase to a paper wallet or even a hardware wallet? That I do not understand. 
Also, I am browsing LocalBitcoins.com and see people selling bitcoins that are priced at around $3,500 when Coinbase is selling it for $4,000. How does that work?

Thank you for your help. So I'm still confused as to why when using a paper wallet that you can only use your private key once. How does a paper wallet compare to a hardware wallet in that sense? Both wallets have a private key so why does the paper one have to be abandoned after it is used?

Why would the price that it sells for change like that? Why can't I just have it automatically sell for 9,000?

What if I want to sell it when it hits $9,000? Whats the difference between stop and limit?

What do you call it when you can automatically sell your BTC when it reaches a certain price? And what are the cons of doing that?
