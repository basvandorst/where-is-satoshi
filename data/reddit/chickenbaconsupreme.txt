Steady as she goes - or maybe could go either way....

+1 for Bitstamp.net , took 2 - 3 days for SEPA to clear but once on there was all easy and straightforward.

Bitcoin made it if the nigerian scam wants bitcoin, not USD. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:27:57
they do not accept wire transfers unless account is verified - at least thats the message i got when i tried. Bitstamp doesnt require verification but the cost per BTC is normall higher than MTGOX.

Looking at the order book volumes I doubt despair is quite over yet.

bitcoinstore.com ? I think we have moved on a little from the socks. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:05:38
Never got to fap. I think it literally was some popup on a movie site and *bam* bitcoins gone.

I keep looking for porn where the girl goes: 'bitcoin, yes, more bitcoins, yes YES YESS YESSSSSSS BITCOINAAAAAAAAAA'
Can't find any :( This injustice must be fixed

Maybe look at different wallets: 
Multibit apparently doesnt need long to synch from what it says there. I am using the default client myself and download wasnt too bad but I am on a highspeed connection.

Dont invest more than you can affort to lose and then everything is a win. If it crashes you 'win' because life goes on withoutmuch hassle. If it doesnt you win - you might have won more but its still a win. 
At least thats my ultra conservative approach to investing :) Although I am not sure if bitcoin investment and ultra conservative actually go in the same sentence.

1) Buying bitcoins - depends on where you are. 
2) Legal: yes
3) price: s2.bitcoininity.org/markets
4) timing: magic8 ball says: yellow.
There is a lot of info in this subreddit, might want to browse a little. If you still ahve questions I have a chat going at  for all types of noobie questions. No financial advice given other than 'dont invest what you are not comfortable losing'.

Seeing Bitcoinity have fun with Bitcoin is what convinced me bitcoin was worth getting into. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:38:33
at least 9000. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:27
There are different options - if you want come to  and there are a few people there you can chat with. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:35:22
Bitcoinity is simply awesome. The guy there seems to always show the perfect pic at the perfect time.

Wooo! thanks :)!

Bitstamp.net just need to factor in SEPA transfer takes 1 - 3 days
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:07:47
Bitcoin gets you laid. True story.

Looking at Bitcoincharts it shows a ASK order at 80 USD for 13500 Bitcoins... I guess we are starting to see some real hoarders showing their hand? 
At current prices that is over 1 Million USD worth of BTC. 
(First time poster btw, Bitcoin fascinates me and finally pushed me over the edge from lurker to poster - be gentle!)

I'm using Bitstamp.net. So far no issues.

Where did I claim I was an expert? The aim of this is simply to make it easier for people to get the info they need if they are having problems finding answers or dont want to wade through pages of confusing posts. So far people who did ask seemed pretty happy - maybe join the chat yourself and help out. 
Note I put the reference to the IRC channel there as well - it doesnt get hoarier than that.

The argument is valid only until  certain point - take any physical currency and look at it from this perspective:
1) scalability - sure, you can lug 1$ around easily, 10$ easily - what about 100000 or more? Apart from the physical limitations (imagine lugging around a few million $ worth of gold bars) you also need to keep the assets secure - so if you want to fairly equate this argument with bitcoin you would have to say that at a certain point any currency requires some form of investment (armoured truck to move stuff around, security guards, vaults to keep it safe etc). Now look at bitcoin again... at a certain point you get all of that for much less than any physical currency. 
2) Give the homeless guy a bar of gold. Can he do anything with it? Sure he can give it to someone willing to accept it as payment - in and of itself it has no value. He cant eat it. He can only trade it. Whoever accepts it as trade must either have i) a need for it or ii) want it or iii) be sure of the fact he can trade it with others as payment for goods or services. 
Now look at bitcoin again. There is no difference if we assume that at some point the method for exchanging and using bitcoins become ubiquitous. You could equate it with saying 20 years ago 'email will never catch on because it requires a computer'. But if computers are everywhere, and you can access and use one without owning it then that argument is no longer as valid.

Not everyone is trying to amass a huge amount of money for a house or some other major purchase. Many people I chat with are excited they made 500$ and can now buy an IPad or laptop. 
Also not sure what you mean by 'cashing out in goods defeats the entire purpose of money'. When I have money, I use it to buy stuff. Sometimes a lot of money for big stuff , sometimes a little money for small stuff. Money in itself has no value for me. It only has value in relation to what I can get for it.  My post is aimed at people spending little amounts on small stuff.

Thanks - I thought irc might actually turn some people off thats why I didnt do it there. But I will pop into the IRC channel as well and help where i can.

Cant stress enough how awesome this video is - watched it 2 weeks ago, and it makes even more sense now.

I faced the same dilemma, even if my investment is tiny so far. I decided safest way is offline paper wallets with the key to each  split up amongst 2 or more guardians . Like this you can be sure no single guardian can even access the accounts alone. I give half a key to guardian and deposit other half with solicitor/lawyer or bank. Could  even cut it up in 3 i guess for even more security.

Awesome - thanks for this. Was exactly looking for a detailed explanation on how to create an offline wallet. I want to buy a bitcoin each for my 3 kids and maybe add some over time - this is perfect. Maybe they will laugh at me in 20 years or think I was smart - we shall see. 

Thanks again

You can buy part of a bitcoin. But tbqh the only sane advice is not to invest more than you can afford to lose. You might get lucky, you might not. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:11:27
Exactly - once you go back to fiat, you will be liable to taxes. If you spend the BTC chances are you wont be if you are smart about it. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:08:39
Why don't you limit the number of orders / minute / account to minimize 0.01 order lag, which seems to be the main culprit of lag spikes? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:52:48
Props on quitting soda, terrible stuff. 
Looks like bitinstant has cash deposit options - if you use that you dont need paypal or CC. You can then have bitinstant transfer that to mtgox (so you need an account there) and then you can buy bitcoins. Bitinstant has some other options there (bitcoin2email) but I am not familiar with how those work.
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:49:25
If bitcoins behave like fiat the only certainty is that , at the end, my wife will have all the bitcoins.

upvote for this, duosecurity is awesome, use it myself privately and at work and their system is by far the easiest way to get proper 2factor authentication for pretty much anything - note its not only linux, you can use it for windows too and RDP.
