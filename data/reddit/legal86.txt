Sometimes I like to play the whole "lets see if I'm psychic" game and predict what type of comments I'll find in threads like this. Yours was the first that came to mind and look what I found!

Lmao dude. You seriously need to chill. I'm amazed you haven't even let any of this go yet.

I love scrolling to the bottom of threads like this just to read the sad and salty comments of extremely jealous and miserable people like yourself. Thanks for the entertainment.

Solid, clearly presented and helpful advice. Thank you so much.

Nice novels you're writing. Just stop dude.

You're so hostile. Everything ok at home, bud? Mommy not make your tendies the right way?

That's a little harsh, isn't it? Calm down lil guy.

When you get around to answering this OP, could you also tell us your social security number, birthdate, and your mother's maiden name? That would be great!

And what do you use to buy those drugs online? Hmmmmm? What's that called? Oh right, Bitcoin.
