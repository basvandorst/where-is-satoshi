forget your login details, or your house burns down and you decided to not "store your bitcoin like a joker" meaning there is no online cloud traces of your private key and you are now suddenly broke.
or better yet, this ones a kicker because its happening every single day....
Invest shit loads into BTC, die, leave nothing for your family because nobody had access to your private keys but you mostly because you didn't want to "Store your bitcoin like a joker" and get robbed. Billions in BTC are left unclaimed due to this simple issue, and millions more will be.
You cannot be a serious investor and have to keep control of millions in equity without people helping you to manage your investments, nobody can help you manage your investments without access to your private keys, until BTC or any other crypto solves this problem allowing specifically assigned levels of permission and transfer quotas based of Private keys its never going to be a secure method of investing. Not if you want your investments to survive your death.

seriously? the government is going to print trillions of dollars for the sole purpose of buying BTC so the price for BTC can reach $10million and all these wannabe millionaires holding BTC can cash out leaving the Government with a devalued currency and pumping trillions into the US economy where FIAT inflation skyrockets to extremes.
Can I have some of whatever you are smoking please, I wanna disconnect from reality too!
