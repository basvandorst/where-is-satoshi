are you bullish or bearish? just curious
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:22:37
I have a dream... of Janet Yellen saying "buy Bitcoin"
all this up and down has me all hot and bothered
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:06:33
it won't be an issue when LN and Schnorr sig's are brought into the fold
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:08:36
sage advice imho. gt gox, btc-e being examples... careful peeps
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:33:10
probably going to get downvoted for this, but bought both on the dip BTC &amp; BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:10:23
how long did the deposit of BCH take overall?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:06:58
please tell me that he mixed up what he was saying
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:55:32
can't buy cheap anymore, I'm all in
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:25:29
a man can dream :'(
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:45:13
accidental pun?? ��
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:46:37
what racks my brain is how the f to account for the BTC after I dumped my BCH... cost basis $0? anyhoo, good problem to have, hehehe
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:11:53
to teh moon?
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:59:13
I hodl both. the reason being BCH is not going away. though BTC is king, doesn't mean that BCH is toxic. It's a bit too much to say that anyone not dumping is complicit to an attack on Bitcoin. Not true, not fair

BTC has been a like the most uninteresting rollercoaster ride for the past 4 days
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:25:37
gdax BTC 3600+
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:24:02
hodling both, so I don't have to worry about shit. BCH not going away, that's almost certain. BTW, don't get me wrong, I'm hodling BTC like no one's business, but diversification is a good thing ��
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:58:02
not sure about that 100%, but that's just my opinion. looking forward to free altcoins!
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:27:13
nah dude, I'm long. I'm going out on a limb and saying that 4k is the support line. I'm guessing that once BTC hits 4.5k and blows past it, BTC will probably and quickly increase +10% easy. but to be honest, I don't know shit, anything can happen
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:48:17
you all check out BCH mempool? LOL. the sad part about it is is that I have a transaction in limbo at 4 confirms. transacted 4 hours ago
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:22:30
my thinking exactly. but I welcome an upward swing as well! win win
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:22:05
fact: when you poke Bitcoin, trading price goes up like an erection
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:55:28
I said some bullshit about renovating my place. little do they know
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:43:43
I did the same, when it was &lt; $2k and before BCH. was already a hodler, but knew I had to get in as much and fast as possible. it was the only way I could think of, good for you! just pretend you're financing a car that appreciates in value :)

a hard one or a nice soft one?
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:19:10
I have Kraken, Coinbase, and Gemini. Of all three, I like Gemini the best. their customer support is rad. response time is the fastest among the lot. 
If you wire money in early on in the morning, you get your funds pretty much the same day.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:01:32
agree, sentiment is bearish, so support will drop below 2k
EDIT: 6pm today on Coinbase $1946. Seems BTC's support price of $2k is starting to give. After a brief rise to ~$2040, BTC's is currently $1984 (below 2k for the 2nd time today). It's very likely that the new support will be $1900. BTW, don't hate me, I'm just stating the facts, and FYI, I love BTC; it's just that, until the dust clears, I'm speculating that the price will continue to drop while leveraging this opportunity to increase my holdings of BTC at a discount.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:43:05
dunno man, seems really pissed off.

@_date: 2017-07-18 05:24:44
there's 2 more weeks left, anything could happen! but since posting my previous prediction, I've been really nervous about missing out on buying cheap. ugh, uncertainty :(
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:10:02
the price of Bitcoin Cash will drop so fast, it probably wouldn't be worth your time
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:04:53
I stopped using Coinbase, Gemini's CS is way superior. not saying Coinbase isn't bad, just saying that they've got too many issues from what I gather on Reddit
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:59:08
I say ~1700, just mho
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:23:47
we need another "buy Bitcoin" stunt. mmmm, cheap BTC
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:13:46
I personally like Gemini. Their customer support is pretty great. I also like the fact that they have good-until-cancelled limit orders and their USD wallet is FDIC insured. FYI, I do not work for them, just a customer.

Supply and demand. Bitcoin has become more mainstream in S. Korea, even in the elderly community. It's widely seen as a an lucrative investment option by many.
On top of that, S. Korea's Bitcoin market is limited to a few exchanges. These exchanges have a limited number of circulating Bitcoin. S. Korea, being a relatively closed market, will have it's own price levels.

@_date: 2017-07-26 02:57:50
I'm guessing that you're talking about the hard kind. I foresee it being very uncomfortable when it happens. Tell me everything will be OK...
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:13:00
as much as I would like for it to reach those levels, it would be almost impossible, since BTC's market cap would be in the quadrillions. gold is around 7-8 trillion last time I checked.
but on the upside, very possible that we'll be watching McAfee eating his own sausage. actually, I wouldn't want to watch that ever.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:03:15
by the time the dust settles, speculators will naturally try to get back in. but by that time, most holders will have already increased their positions during the selloff. so, yep... skyrocketing prices. simple rule of supply and demand :)
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:20:06
you sound like a crackhead, but +1 we have same idea
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:55:56

there's a BBC video interview of him from back in 2015 (or 2013, forgot), pretty interesting.

or just to not give a fuck. in the end, everything will be fine.
