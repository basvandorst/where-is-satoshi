I think you were looking for a different sub my friend...... r/BaronBankers perhaps. You are welcome to your opinion though..... Just remember this in a few years and I promise to do the same: "A smart man changes his mind.... A darn fool never does. "

This was a good article. Eye opening in a few regards to the state of the stock market and the upcoming retirement of boomers. As a millennial, its gonna be exciting! Thanks for posting.

Anyone worried about the CBOE expiration's tomorrow or do you think we have seen the worst of it for now?

Bro..... You can do it!
Step one: buy Bitcoin.....
Step two: HODL until it gets to 12K and beyond......
Step three: Sell Bitcoin and buy nice things!

OP: File a support ticket with [Blockchain.info]( if possible. Usually a long process so start it in case you need to escalate. At very least, they can probably provide further info. 
Good Luck Mate!

I was wondering this myself..... Perhaps they decided to let loose.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:09:28
Dropped thousands of coins on the market to sell. they have pounded the market a few times over the last six months. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:11:48
Yeah the tiny hack out of South Korea and the 4 exchanges being investigated (mentioned above) seem to be the only reasons I can find. The volume is so stacked, I cannot even get an order placed for BTC on Binance.... the page never fully loads.

I checked this guys wallet btw.... no movement today

There have been traders that consistently beat the market....

 Hard to say what all the Asia markets will do when they wake up and see the current state. I hope they buy the dip like I just did. 
Just gonna leave this here: [ (Buy the Dip) \- (NSFW\-language)

Does it actually work? Even matching Amazon Prime shipping it says! Anyone tried this site?

Really.... someone is blaming New Mexico? Bonus points for knowing New Mexico is a state, but this is the dumbest thing I have seen on reddit all week. New Mexico has nothing to do with this.

 "Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash were sold in a manner that had no effect on market price". 
This line boils my blood. No effect on the market? so those were fake massive declines we witnessed when you sold? You dropped over 20,000 coins (BTC/BCH) on an exchange. YOU CRIPPLED THE MARKET DUDES! 
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:51:42
Yes, they recently added a withdrawal feature. Congrats on the purchase my friend! Best of luck and keep on Hodling
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:59:44
Yeah but not this much volume..... when was the last time you saw 300 Million (24 hour) on a Sunday in BTC/USDT? (Binance)

Still in Bull Market sadly...... this is the correction from the last week of slightly up

OP, what bank do you use? Are you trying to load funds with debit card or credit card?
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:26:38
Why not do both?

For a good example.... look into the Venezuelan people and their use of Monero/Bitcoin.... The people there are using Crypto to protect themselves from hyper inflation as the Bolivar plummets in purchasing power.

Hello OP. As many have said, nobody really knows what comes next. The most we can do is look for signs in the market and place an educated guess. I watch the charts often as I enjoy it and have my own guess. My thought is we pull back from here. We had the AT&amp;T news this week and other positive news..... only to retrace a few hundred. On the other hand.... I was blown away by the support around $7,600. It was gobbling up bears left and right!  Personally, I would wait to buy. Watch the charts..... if we pull back below $7,400\~ there is no telling how far our young coin drops. If we bust out above $8,350 (and hold it).... I would be un-able to fight my FOMO and would buy in thinking a larger rise was coming behind it. No matter the scenario though...... losses in crypto are just on paper if you HODL. Wait 12 months and you are likely to be in the gains again. Good luck friend!

You are correct, in all fairness..... but it does show a blind-spot in their services. Evaluate the current market..... not the one we just left.
