Well, one way would be for exchanges to have positive verification of user actions — e.g. email or SMS verification. This pushes the question of account ownership off onto the email and phone providers, of course.
All access controls can be defeated somehow — whether by brute-forcing passwords, cracking security holes, corrupting the site owner, or rubber-hose cryptanalysis of the user. The ability to maintain or recover control of an account serves as a limit on the amount of value that can be safely stored in that account.

Well, sure, Bitcoin is an experimental system, with a market dominated by speculation. You can't buy land or capital with it; mostly you can buy contraband, handcrafts, and souvenirs. That makes it on par with Linden Dollars, not U.S. dollars. It's probably best regarded as a live-steel technology demo, or a startup with a lot of really excited investors. Most startups don't survive.
Anyone who thinks Bitcoin is stable is an idiot. However, anyone who thinks that MtGox being hacked proves that Bitcoin is broken, is two idiots. It's like saying that the Citibank hack proves U.S. dollars are useless. Clues for idiots: whether a currency is useful depends on *what you can buy and sell with it,* not the account security of a big bank that trades in it.
There *cannot exist* a stable BTC/USD exchange rate until there is a sufficiently large amount of BTC/USD exchanging *for non-speculative purposes* — i.e. to get shit done, not just to hold multiple currencies. Out in the "real world", there are lots and lots of people who want to exchange USD and EUR so they can do business between the European economy and the American economy. Currency speculation piggybacks on (and supports) "serious business" needs for currency exchange.
(Warning: I have no dog in this fight. I find the Bitcoin idea interesting, but I own a total of 0.04 BTC.)
