I mean there is people that use and accept bitcoin as a medium for exchanges already, so your statement just isn't true about bitcoin.

This works great unless your state doesn't allow coinbase pro.....

Can't you report losses of $20 on coin b to negate coin a profits? Or am I completely wrong I know you can do this for gambling winnings....
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:42:37
Ah so as long as you hold coin b at the end of the year no taxable event took place, so you still owe taxes on your $10 profit got it that makes sense.

Yea its called hedging
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:21:16
Ah yes assuming btc will never correct itself and hedging against 40% drops offs always a badidea your right....

No they shouldn't, this is how an algorithm works.  Guy googled bitcoin CEO Google brought up ceo's mentioned in bitcoin articles this is working as intended.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:59:36
Lol this is just how an algorithm works
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:32:26
Yea what would you think would happen if someone tried to sell a few billion worth of btc right now on an exchange? There isn't enough volume on any exchange in the world to handle these types of transactions without drastically moving the price.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:57:28
Its the algorithm and a user that doesn't understand it. Or does and is an idiot.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:46:34
Nice DD, I really liked the part where you explained why.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:56:05
No it is because he googled bitcoin CEO and doesn't understand how a fucking algorithm works. Its kind of like if you Google American inventor you get a bunch of African American inventors.  When you add CEO you get results with people that are known ceo's to Google's algorithm that are mentioned in bitcoin articles.

This isn't how contracts work at all. If you buy a btc for 10k it cost 10k, if you bought a contract right now to short for 10k it only cost a small portion of that amount. So when the price goes to 12k you make 2k minus the cost of the contract.  Now if it goes to 6k you have a contract to sell at 10k and only lose the value of the contract you don't lose any more money then your initial cost of contract when btc goes up.....

These huge sell offs are litteraly nothing, the dollar lost 10%ish in value in 2017, go look at actual value drop its like 1 trillion losing a few hundo billion is nothing....

You're correct there is zero upside for investors and companies that are bullish long term on btc... Companies don't get more coins for goods and services.  Investors don't get more coins when trading fiat for crypto right now...  People who bet on currencies specifically the American dollar didn't lose on that bet in 2017.... Imagine that when you look at crypto as a currency all the things that applies to fiat also applies to crypto.  If btc becomes a widely accepted currency or store of value around the world it will be worth trillions so no a 200 billion swing will not be a big deal.
