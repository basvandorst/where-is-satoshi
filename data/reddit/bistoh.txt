Coinbase is the most common place people buy crypto, but their fees are extortionate. I would recommend buying straight from gdax.
And I would say a wallet is 100% necessary if you want to keep the bitcoin you have, safe.

You get many "dips" a day but are normally recovered within an hour tops, last crashes of bitcoin were years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:08
They can be. I didn't do much research before I bought and went through coinbase. I did a £500 purchase for my first order and got charged £20.

Mining bitcoins really won't work unless you have multiple super computers. The only way to make real money with bitcoin is to buy it and hold.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:15:42
That is genius... See you in 10-20 years.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:31:15
I know I know, it's an addiction! But yeah I plan to hold for a long ass time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:08
If you go through exchanges you can buy one day and sell the next, however it's much like getting money changed in person, they have certain rates, and charge fees.

Personally I'd get the initial investment back, that way you haven't lost anything IF it drops, and still have an investment for if it rises more. That's just what I'd do.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:33:17
nah fuck that, get a second, if not third job to pay for the trip. JUST HOLD

finally bought in for £500 last night at £8.944.50
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:39:34
Honestly, I invested £500 2 days ago, it's already up to £640. My plan was to grab some quick profit and leave... But I think as soon as i've doubled it I'm taking the £500 I put in, and taking it back, then leaving the rest in for as long as I can
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:03:26
No dip is guaranteed to happen 18th, and the prices have just started rocketing up again, if I was you i'd invest it as soon as you possibly can, as if the dip does happen, it will probably dip down to more than the price currently is anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:50:24
now my only regret is not dropping an extra £500
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:56:27
fake anyway
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:28
You're one of the people that make these dips happen... You don't deserve bitcoin if you can't hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:01:49
Some people say could decline price, some say it may cause a bigger increase in price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:32
I'd say around $0, but a large amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:54:04
Just hold through the dips, it'll always correct itself after, all the people who panic sold are regretting it now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:49
soon every 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:23
Especially when they live with their parents and don't pay the bills? It's a no brainer
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:02:56
Out of curiosity, how much are we talking here?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:10:46
Not worth waiting for a crash, could raise another 5k before another real crash
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:49
You know what everyone's answers will be to this... HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:22:34
If I’m not mistaking coinbase get their bitcoin from gdax, but charge you a fee of I believe £20gbp for using their services, as coinbase is linked to some online wallets and is easy to use/register to.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:33
If I could afford 4k to invest right now i'd do it in a heart beat. I took £500 out my savings yesterday and dropped it on bitcoin, because if the worst happens and I lose it, it's not an amount that will break my bank. I'm obviously not gonna make as much as if I dropped all my savings on it, but i'm making profit either way. You can spend the next 3 weeks waiting on a correction, but it could end up doubling in price again and you'll regret it. Just don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Never doubt the strength of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:05:04
The more people that hear about it, the more people buy it, and the more the price rises.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:23:08
My mistake was coinbase but the amount they charge is ridiculous, after doing (late) research I found out that GDAX is a good place to buy and sell with low fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:36
This dude definitely saw some sort of iphone app ad.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:59:57
The price "drop" is still higher than it was this time last week, the only panic sellers are the people that probably bought this week. Bitcoin will never stop rising.

Wake me up at 6 figures.
