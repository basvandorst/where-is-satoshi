it's used here for speculation, for drugs, and occasionally for online purchases like Overstock or gyft.
in the Philippines it's used for receiving money overseas.

because of different tech and financial infrastructure, different social conventions, different laws, heck even just popularity. Some countries it's not popular, and that's why nobody uses it, because there's nobody to trade bitcoin with, or businesses that accept it.

Interesting, I just wonder why Switzerland and not other countries? Is it that you have an easy way to convert bitcoin into francs (and vice versa)? Is it the prevalence of advanced technology? Just trying to analyze tech trends.

I've been trying to recall a song that's been on the tip of my tongue for awhile now, it's a 90s song by a female singer or band, and one of the verses ends with, "I think I really do." Any ideas?

Just went through the BitSimple process, currently only lets you buy BTC with a Wire transfer.

Isn't there an economic incentive for miners to leave the pool as it approaches 51%? Theoretically the pool could be coordinating funds to all the miners, but for something like GHash with has how many miners, it seems like they'd only do an attack to benefit those at the top of the pool, while as the individual miners would be screwed.

The Casascius coin guy didn't know he was laundering, and they put a stop to that.

Had the same thing happen to me when trying to get a cash deposit into Wells Fargo via some punk on localbitcoins: 
It was my first time doing a cash deposit, and so I kept going back and forth in my head between releasing the escrow and refreshing my online banking site over and over again for the update. After numerous calls to bank representatives, they said, "You should be able to see it online nearly instantaneously." After 20-30 min, it sunk in that this guy was actually trying to scam me.
Should've known better than to waste time with someone with zero rating. The next transaction I did with Wells Fargo was totally legit, and appeared on my online banking site immediately.

What was the conclusion from this investigation?

When the vagaries of these laws baffle me, I look at the spirit of the law. The spirit of the AMLs is to stop people who are committing crimes from hiding their money trail. I think it's the seller's legal duty to halt the transaction as soon as he knew his funds were being used for illegal activities.

Hell yes, had the same idea yesterday. I was a long time fan of Intrade, but when their CEO died trying to climb Mt. Everest, so did the website.

What protocol changes are coming up that might mitigate the risk of a 51% attack?
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:24:29
How much you want to bet they tried this technique with a few other LBC traders, and Michelhack was the only one dumb enough to knowingly provide money to someone about to commit crimes.

Thanks for summarizing the story. I've had to piece this all together on my own over the past week, trying to make sense of it.
In a way, open-source is working as expected in that there are tons of alt-coins, and people are voting by choosing to use different networks. But in another way, open-source isn't working as expected, because developing open protocols didn't seem to involve so much greed. The protocols themselves were worthless, but in Bitcoin's case, the protocol IS money. That's one, and two, it's an oligopoly run by the miners. The developers have no votes except symbolic ones. And the exchanges are in a similar camp as the developers'.
To parallel to the Internet's adoption, sure, there is a few network operators on the Internet, whose objectives are different than other people using it (network neutrality for example), but it's not so tightly wound to a monetary issue. Protocol debates seem like they can be pretty academic. But currency protocol debates seems too toxic.
Don't know, still forming my opinion.

In Arizona, you don't need an MTL. Some states, the fees is only like $300. But in others, like California, it's in the thousands.
There really needs to be one national BitLicense.

hah, yeah I know it's a trite comment, but just really wanted to test changetip. Tip 2 cents @_date: 2015-07-22 19:51:51
Yeah, as much as I love Lyft, I think the non-tipping thing is better UX. Tip 1 dime @_date: 2016-07-10 08:52:23
Hindsight is 20/20, but consider a random price drop of Bitcoin in half. Would that drop the hash rate? Surely some miners couldn't afford it, and would stop. Drops have been happening, the halvening is another drop, and the miners are future-thinking economic actors, so they are either prepared for reduced revenues or they're not. The one difference between the halvening and other price fluctuations of Bitcoin is that this one was predictable.

Thanks, is there a link for more information about that? What does it mean "must agree." So a new version comes out, gradually everybody installs it, the ones that don't, do they still keep trading? Or is that even the right question?

Just got a direct PM on Reddit from someone at Coinbase, turns out it WAS a glitch, and my bank transfer never started. They got me my BTC back plus a little extra for my troubles, and said that if I start the xfer again, I'll get my money. Wish I had gotten this service via the standard support channels, but hey, I'm happy now that it's on the path to being resolved.

Okay, sorry for the half-post. Level 1. Have not made transaction before. Made this on Sunday, August 18, 2013, at 10:32am PDT. It told me it would take 3 days. It is now 2 days late.

No I mean decimal places on Bitcoins. Like beyond satoshi's etc.

What do you want? I can show a screenshot of coinbase and my wells fargo, but that doesn't prove anything.
