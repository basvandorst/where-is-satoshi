LibertyX (LibertyX.com) if paying cash or debit card and there is a store near you 
Cash app if you don’t want to go to a store and are OK linking your bank account

their uptime and service is incredible. coinbase/gemini get DDOS'ed whenever the price is pumping. not libertyx. they store fees are higher but they are reliable and cash is instant.

This is awesome!

Yes, went to one of the gas stations in Toronto and followed their directions. They said they never heard of any of the companies mentioned. Did you try?
@_date: 2016-03-27 18:46:23
If even 1% of the stores worked and the fees were even close to workable this would be a gamechanger. Neither is true. I just tried a Canada store and they had no idea what i was talking about. These headlines are sensationalist and don't do anyone good. Just like the 100K bitcoin ATM announcements a year ago. Who will pay 16% for bitcoin? Might as well use purse.io lol

Finally a REAL BITCOIN ATM not this cash-in BS
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:21:32
\+1 never heard of buybitcoinmap but it looks awesome!
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:50:46
can bitsquare add libertyx retial stores to its network? seems like a good fit
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:52:19
libertyx if you are in a state they service. bitcoin in minutes with cash at local stores.
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:53:11
Yowsers. Is there a LibertyX bitcoin ATM near you? They charge 8% but the price is the same as Coinbase so at least it’s transparent.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:51:22
libertyx if you want to use cash
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:35:53
I think all providers basically use the same KYC services so may be out of luck if so. Check out libertyx.com. They have local stores where you can buy with cash or debit card. Still up there at 8% but less than BTMs.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:50:09
use cash and buy bitcoin with libertyx.com
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:05:38
LibertyX cashier location (libertyx.com) or bitcoin cash atm (coin radar).
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:08:25
LibertyX is still phone number for $200 limit. Can use debit card or cash. Fee is 8% so you might save a little as well. No volume discount though if you want to buy a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:13:07
LibertyX support bc1. I had no problem using Wasabi though I find Edge it BRD easier unless you really want to privacy features.
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:28:19
libertyx store, fees are 8%
bitcoin atm, different operators so YMMV, fees are 7-15% if you are lucky and some are running promos may be less
isn't this what abra did a while back?
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:55:15
Check out LibertyX (LibertyX.com). You can buy bitcoin on regular ATM machines. Looks like they have a few in Greensboro. Flat 8% fee and they don’t juice the rate.
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:49:37
i went to my local grocer and it wasn't available, and when i asked no one had any idea what i was talking about. it seems like most of the locations aren't set up to take cash. not sure why they don't accept change. i have plenty of coins i want to get rid of!
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:48:17
probably because of integrations with existing atms like this: [
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:53:00
Why aren't you a fan? I know a lot of people didn't like the bait &amp; switch on the 3% insured guaranteed savings rate that they now have taken back / off the table.
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:42:30
You provide your bitcoin address via the app before you to to the ATM. Then you just enter the order # and insert the debit card like a regular ATM transaction to complete the purchase. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:02:44
I need to add this to my domino's comments on the order!
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:53:04
Check out LibertyX as well. You can buy bitcoin to any wallet of your choice. Their rate is spot on with Coinbase and they charge a flat 8%. They have both debit atms and cashier location.
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:26:14
lol. so much fine print at the bottom.
@_date: 2019-09-16 21:20:14
those exposed cables and power cords make this look super sketchy and ripe for MITM attacks.
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:02:05
there is no LibertyX machine. you just buy from the cashier who uses the LibertryX portal (it's like their own POS system).
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:11:21
Libertyx stores or ATMs, any btm, cash app holds the Btc in a hosted wallet
@_date: 2019-09-01 00:40:06
lol at the sketchy bum. do you have a picture of the machine? who is the operator? or do you buy from a person? the arrow is pointing to the bum.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:36:16
so many ppl going to make mistakes sadly
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:35:52
i go to libertyx stores in denver. not sure if they have any in boulder but way cheaper than the typical atm junket fees.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:02:19
This is generally based on how much you are buying. Check out LibertyX and localbitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:42:11
They had LibertyX bitcoin also on the ATM there. I think I went to one in Tampa. Did you have cash or did you need to withdraw before buying? Using debit card saves the cash ATM fees if that applies to you.
@_date: 2019-05-02 15:19:35
Multiple ppl have all confirmed this. They mark up the price a lot. Very sneaky. I could charge 1% and then put 9% in the FX. It penalizes noobs who don’t realize anyone can set their price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:24:12
Hmm. What was the error? QSomeone else mentioned it on this thread but try an ATM. LibertyX is integrated into regular ATMs where you can use your debit card.
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:23:02
Why do we call everything an atm? These at best are coin counting machines. Btms aren’t even atms technically
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:28:10
Is that a map of active locations? Is there a locator?
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:50:10
That map is just for coinstar. They prob aren’t licensed in FL for example. links above show lots of LibertyX and in general btms in the SE and FL market though.
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:18:56
Seconded. LibertyX sent bitcoin before I got back  from the ATM to my car. Bitcoin cash ATMs are also quick from my personal experience.
