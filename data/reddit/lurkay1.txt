Do you think he'll use a fork and knife, or will he just go at it like Kobayashi

I don't pay any fees. I told you.

I might be a bit fucking crazy but I like having ATMs and bank locations everywhere, and I'm responsible with my money and get a direct deposit so I never get fucked with overdraft or monthly maintenance fees.

Will you be pissed if you sell at €11000, and it shoot up to €20000
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:00:42
Dude. A direct deposit of $500 or more a month waves the fees. Not substantial in my book. I pay zero fees, as I don't overdraw my account, and I have no need to use a 3rd party ATM as my banks ATMs are found everywhere. And if I need to withdraw more than $500 I can go into a location anywhere in the country. I know what you're trying to say, and yeah credit unions have their pluses. But all I'm saying is that you can be a big bank customer and still be happy as long as you're not irresponsible.

My point is they've never done anything to me, and there isn't really a reason to switch for me.

Bitcoin is not MySpace or yahoo. It is apple or Microsoft, making computers from the very beginning but continuing to improve upon itself and now is widely used and has billions of units sold.

When you sell at 12.5k because you think it's failing but it's already back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:43:44
My advice...don't look at it. Set an alert for if it rises above x amount and forget about it. Go on with your life, enjoy your Christmas or Chanukah or Kwanzaa or whatever the fuck.

I thought Currency in this context meant the coin and/or paper money of any country that is designated as legal tender by the country of issuance?

Im thinking it will level out at 10 after a series of dips and surges.

I won't be surprised if Warren Buffet's not around in 10-20 years.

You could see this as a time to buy. This thing might be worth a hell of a lot more in three years.

It's called a gambling addiction.

Anyone who wants to use bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme will be mortified when their "investment" suddenly loses half its value and they sell it as soon as it gets back to just below what they bought it for fear it will happen again. There isn't such thing as getting in and getting out unless you got extremely lucky in November.
