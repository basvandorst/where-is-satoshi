You spelt it incorrectly too, that's a bit weird.
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:39:37
My bad
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:05:46
How do you know all the reasons for every single buyer and seller?
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:17:15
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:12:04
Get your brain checked immediatley it's not activating at full capacity
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:12:25
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:36:18
You guys are all my friends right.........RIGHT????
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:23:39
Just checking in on my Lambo fund and I'm 99.7% short of target
@_date: 2019-07-04 02:54:05
Never is a very long time... Especially since it was below 10k within the past week.
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:48:10
Wake up!!!
It's gone to shit!!!
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:59:34
Terrible cars, what was it a Punto?
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:11:06
Eh no man, can't you see a joke when it's in front of your face? :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:23:53
So your saying there's a chance
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:22:51
You spelt 'dictator' wrong
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:17:32
Your a 'panic selling'
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:47:19
You really know how to have a good time
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:55:20
It's impossible to 'prove TA wrong' as all TA does is provide probabilities
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:24:29
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:22:08
Isn't a honeymoon period supposed to be at the beginning of something?
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:14:50
Cue the 'I don't care what it drops to, I'm buying'
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:52:31
There are literally thousands of people around the world making a solid living using TA. 
If they switched to tea leaves their kids will starve and it will be your fault!
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:13:23
BJ's..... A huge lack of BJ's
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:56:54
Does it matter
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:16:49
Say that to the thousands of people avoiding actual work and making a great living out if it world over.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:01:14
Up or down?
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:46:37
Yeah but he's a dick... So there's that
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:30:47
People have spend 30 years making a consistent living using TA. You can accept that as a fact or not, doesn't make a difference.
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:11:51
You will lose most of your money over the next 18 months as the market changes from grinding lower to huge counter trend rallies back to eventually grinding lower
@_date: 2018-08-14 06:24:19
Yes, I believe that's how you do it
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:35:18
When an asset goes down on positive news it's not bullish, I hate to be the one to break it to you.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:55:47
It won't go under $6k ever again?
That's what you actually think?
Brilliant ������
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:56:48
It's 8 months into a bear market.
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:16:04
Based on what exactly?
Looks to be still in the heart of a long term bear market to me
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:17:24
More sellers than buyers 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:53:01
Don't do it.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:58:19
Just to be clear I'm referring to Satoshi
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:17:29
Didn't know you could predict the future.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:56:36
Get down after more thousand, when sentiment is at an all time low, then you may see the bottom
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:48:54
I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be safety?

@_date: 2018-08-04 20:29:30
It's completely hilarious
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:53:42
I believe they call that 'burying your head in the sand'
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:57:46
Don't listen to that slut!!!
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:54:03
That's one method of investment ��
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:57:13
In that case you are pretty limited do give them a go, I recommend against it as they let me down for a late connection a few years back and I ended up having to buy another flight.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:19:38
There's a lot of dicks on the forum tonight
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:17:17
Cool storey
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:59:12
You right, 7 days down is mega bullish ��
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:18:49
It won't be happeningn soon, it just won't.

The Bitcoin bear market of 2018 is real... Fo sho
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:54:32
Needs to be almost instantaneous
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:00:27
Except last year, when it was much cheaper
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:36:17
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:32:44
That's not my logic, that's my conclusion friend.
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:54:23
8 months into a tough bear market, anybody holding through that loves pain and mental torture. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:48:10
That's the very definition of a bear market
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:14:56
Maybe that's because it's Falling like a stone... I dunno
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:20:16
'pretty sure' 
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:39:54
There's so much wrong here I'm actually impressed.
Sellers are not selling below market price, whatever a seller sells for, at the instant if the transaction, that is market price.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:19:46
You wanna see crazy prices? Check out our sofa liquidation sale now on!! These prices can't be beat..
Best price in town or your money back!
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:15:37
That's my point :)
I don't think you can 'pretty sure' either.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:15:57
Insightful one you are
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:14:29
Isn't that a Trump quote? :)
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:17:43
It's was a joke. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:01:14
It's actually pretty easy, if you want to convert your Bitcoin to a currency you can actually spend, you will have Less if that currency now than you would have had yesterday... Simples
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:31:33
That made me Lol :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:59:51
I guess it all depends on where you see Bitcoin at 2025 and where you see USD. I am not a big dollar fan, but I would absolutely not put my net worth into Bitcoin with a timeline if 8 years given its volatility and uncertainty
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:04:13

@_date: 2018-05-29 06:16:48
That opinion  didn't age well.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:54:53
Yes... Exactly
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:12:37
Your opinion is worthless.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:15:51
This sure ain't boring
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:44:13
Yeah that makes sense

Lol.... Yeah

If it went down to the 3k area and held I would buy some.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:44:22
You funny man :)
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:32:40
I have my doubt s about that one :)
We're 7 months into a bear market man, and real bottoms do not give this much opportunity.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:48:02
That's some nice Trolling Troll

@_date: 2018-06-10 21:23:41
Aaaaaaaaaaaanf the bottom is in :)
Just kidding, I think this thing is going much lower.

But don't actually fuck him, that would be Gross.

It was the truth.
The other guy will sober up soon.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:37:05
Well you have me convinced ��
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:37:14
Bottoms rarely give you a chance to buy and tops a chance to sell.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:28:47
Sorry Les, you got owned in this exchange
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:22:56

@_date: 2019-06-30 15:46:50
It will not

Yes I'm talking about the Nasdaq index, which created a bubble in 2000, crashed, and then surpassed that bubble high o er a decade later. Same index. It's not complicated.
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:06:17
Technically we don't fully know whether we are in a recession until three quarters afterwards so we may be in one right now, but I doubt it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:00:19
Shits gonna get real in the next one.
@_date: 2018-11-23 17:46:03
Please, nobody is that silly, holding through a 75% correction would be madness

Ffs, I can't be assed looking up that word
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:10:08
You don't usually get long to buy a top or sell a bottom, which leads me to believe the bottom is not in yet.
Just my thoughts peeps, calm down. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:41:27
I'm taking about the Nasdaq

@_date: 2018-03-06 18:25:23
Hey man.. I just posted a chart offering a different point of view.. we have potentially been in a downtrend since we reversed from all time highs. It's a possibility.
Charts don't forecast price, they show some paths of least resistance. Nothing is garanteed.
Not even you can predict the future ��
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:56:49
The DOW up today is not related to the Fed in any way.

You can believe in the technology and not have it destroy your financial stability.. it's not as black and white as 'you are a short term trader or else you own forever despite all consequences'

Hahahahahaha brilliant
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:10:18
I am same.  Will wait for a confirmed bottom and go long.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:53:12
Cool... Which toy model did you get?
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:15:09

Blaming traders when markets go down us funny ��
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:27:00
Beware a break to new lows, this does NOT look like a bottom to me 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:00:32
FUD mods please delete!!
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:48:14
There were some huge Bear market rallies in that time that would have stopped out any good Futures trader, it's all so easy look at a historical chart.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:00:05
Some 'normal investors' like to invest short term also
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:13:59
So I 'hold' the two opposing ideas and I 'HODL' the Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:42:01
Then why are you quoting him?
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:40:34
Tagging for excretion
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:55:57
I think I'm starting to work it out now, it's manipulation on the way down right?
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:26:41
Yes but the Nasdaq broke through the highs created in the previous bubble, that was the question
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:01:39
I sort of don't believe you.. sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:04:10
I dunno.. 
You seem like the sad one in this particular convo ��

There will be a mega rally on this at some point
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:12:45
You don't know anything about the evidence I have only that it's not any more or less than you..
Keep dreaming mate ��
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:12:39
Actually it does, there is an issue on Reddit of people creating new accounts constantly just for the purpose of trolling
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:56:13
Cash in now man!
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:06:55
I have to say I'm impressed that you actually counted that
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:45:16
Why is it inevitable exactly?
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:38:19
It's concieveable (only just) that your parents invested $5 on Dypers for you today... Anything else happened only in your Kray Kray brain my  friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:13:15
I'll find Lambo under bridge?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:49:51
I believe experienced non 'noob' Bitcoin holders are also worried about price. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:24:01
That's definitely a part of it. The more people use it in a way it becomes self fullfilling, but it is also a way to tune out all of the nose in markets and just focus on what the price action has done. This then offers potential paths of least resistance.
It is not a predictor of future events. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:12:54
Good call.
If there is a confirmed bottom you can get back in.
Holding through a 70% correction is madness IMO
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:45:57
I love when people tell me what I think :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:23:12
Is there such a thing as bad penetration? 
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:11:31
Oh it's possible baby... It's possible
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:46:12
You're preaching to the choir  ��
I agree with everything you said.
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:31:14
Omg bitcoin is a really annoying girlfriend ��
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:21:40
Well it has fallen from 19k
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:44:39
I read the first 7 lines of your essay and will regret it for the rest of my life.
Good luck in clown school. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:57:17
HODL through a 75% correction is terrible advice, despite what Bitcoin does from here
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:04:09
Did somebody really say we would never see 7k again when it dropped to $6600? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:03:38
That's commitment .
Admirable, but crazy IMO
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:06:20
Aren't you both looking at the same chart?
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:29:59
Not too soon I hope, I haven't covered shorts yet.

@_date: 2018-03-06 18:49:07
Another opinion.
Beware, it may not be the same as yours .
Also... It's just an opinion, put the pitch forks away ��
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:13:18
I give you zero %chance that you will see 30k by June this year.
I give almost as small odds that we see new all time high in that same period.
Just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:56:10
95% of Bitcoin owners are in it to get rich.

Are you from the future?
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:17:32
Listen to me carefully.
What you are doing are classic mistakes and it will lead you to bankruptcy if you don't stop.
If there is no Trend and it's bouncing around in a range stay out. If you are a long term buy and hold believer than take a smaller position so it doesn't hurt so much and you don't spend every along hour watching price.
Just some friendly advice as I went through the same thing when I started trading a decade ago.

@_date: 2018-03-31 02:59:48
Your research has one fatal flaw. Your brain.
Bitcoins intrinsic value is Zero if the public decides that it does not want it, or if something better comes along.
Mining costs are irrelevant in this regard.

It doesn't matter what companies make up the index and how they change, all that matters is that you own it.
And if you owned it during that last bubble, and held it until now,you would have seen the  new all time highs.

Hahaha if it's in the past it's not false or unsubstituted you moron ��
You need troll lessons.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:58:56
Hiding behind bots as an excuse for price action is BS.
They are part of it on the way up and the way down, but the reality is there are currently more sellers than buyers.

There's stiff competition
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:59:59
If you are new to this let me give you one piece of simple advice.
Do not listen to anybody who claims to know whether the price will go up, or whether it will go down, where the price will turn and when it will reach new highs.
A little experience will tell you that nobody knows the answers to those questions. And those that claim they do are either charlatans or delusional.
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:13:16
Haha mate you are the one that's impossible to talk to here :)
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:05:27
It may retest recent lows.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:02:22
If you do I would keep it small.. volatility is insane and snap back Rally's have been huge
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:20:41
Not every TA I post has been wrong mate :) 
I've been bearish since mid teens.
Timeline wise, I think we break lower in next 4 months.

No straw man, just trying to understand your thought process.
We definitely think differently about this but each to his and and that's what makes markets...

Cue the abuse ��

The douches and clowns have been correct. It's falling like a lead balloon mate 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:58:58

@_date: 2018-03-27 02:02:57
Not if I want to keep my hair
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:36:47
Juxtapose that with just wishing really hard and you got yourself a solid investment strategy ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:35:54
The poster says he would hold to Zero. That's what I'm saying is crazy, holding an investment to zero. The technology will evolve and Bitcoin may not be a central part of it
 
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:40:53
Did you check your horoscope?
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:45:41

That's where the money for the past month has been made
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:45:20
First.. there's nothing typical about Bitcoin, it's Rally's or its dips.
Second.. I don't expect it to keep going to 20k at all, or at least not for many years.
Third. A 12% fall in 48 hours is a big dip no matter how you slice it.

It's highly lightly, and not exactly comparable to predicting Bitcoin price action, bit I cannot, like you, say that I 'know' that it will rise tomorrow.

@_date: 2018-02-22 00:22:32
Haha yeah.. with alligators and snakes at the bottom
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:14:44
Feel like it wants to go lower

Why is it market manipulation if price goes down and then up...
Isn't that what markets do?

You didn't realize children use this sub? Are you serious?

You may be right.. it's a bit of a mad house in here ��

If you have 500 coins.. and therefore roughly $5,000,000 worth of coins, then please do yourself and your future sanity a favour and take some profits.. if Bitcoin represents all your investments and you are a Bitcoin millionaire... Take some off the table!!
Come on people!
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:08:19
Difficult to tell, somebody has encrypted the bottom identifier.. 
But I can see it's set to blow under $1000

God bless the slow technology ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:17:52
Haven't attack it at all mate, maybe read back through the convo.

Do I get my Lambo at the end of this song?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:32:07
Nice trading.
There's nothing wrong with taking profits after a rally.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:23:02
Some guys just don't see sarcasm ��
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:34:09
No idea either
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:33:20
A 2000% gain isn't enough?
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:43:10
Haha the old head in sand technique ��
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:24:04
Whatever man..
Keep the tin foil hat on 
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:44:26
Yeah.... BET ��
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:00:36
If it does find a bottoom it will need to test it more than once to build a foundation.. at that stage I would get in.. if it gets below 2k would be a gift
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:49:35
There's nothing wrong with taking profits. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:49:21
Punto or Brava?

Out of curiosity, what level did you buy in at? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:34:18
Lot of selling pressure today
Bulls need to assert themselves to get back in control.
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:45:26
It was that past when I said that ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:51:16
Don't buy until there is a confirmed bottom in.
Sure youi miss the first $1500 but that is better than getting burned repeatidly catching a falling knife.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:27:24
It looks like it wants to break it today. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:26:57
I think he was talking about it being down today
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:39:00
It's an Office Space joke.. nevermind ��
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:33:37
You keep saying that but it's not correct ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:36:17
Seems legit ��
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:12:26
That's true.. there's a whole nudder brigade when it's going up, almost as unbearable
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:21:59
Jeez.. you blew my cover man
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:43:15
I'm pretty confident in the work this guy seems to have done..
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:31:22
IF it revisits recent lows, AND it holds those lows, that would be a Bullish sign.
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:09:35

Yeah fiat is just so useless day to day, I almost never use it ��
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:37:19
No I don't know.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:00:05
That escalated quickly ��
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:34:49
You may be right :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:29:21
Hey... Some of that is owed to me from a lottery I won 
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:02:48
Traditional TA works very well with Bitcoin. I don't see any reason for that to change.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:54:20
I don't think it will see new ATH this year.
Just my opinion 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:39:18
I actually bought Bitcoin just to make some $$$ 
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:48:56
Yeah... not really.
There are literally thousands of people who make their living from TA
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:38:14
"this is going to sky rocket so high' ..
I would thread carefully predicting the future and advising others mate.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:50:11
Its fallen 80% from its peak twice before - that puts it at $4000 if it does it again.
Thats where I'll take a nibble
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:11:00
It's true, credit cards for work very well.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:06:09
Also not one of my comments have been dishonest, if you don't like different opinions, don't use a public forum. ��
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:09:17
Bitcoin is subject to liquidy, we are in a QT phase, e have been for all of 2018.
It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:41:29
Haha yep.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:04:38
I would not spend my coffee on Bitcoin!

I'm beginning to think you are a pensioner ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:54:52
What do you call a shill exactly?
Some guy called me a shill earlier because I had a different opinion to him. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:01:48
And that's how bear markets work... Those waiting for a chance to get out do so on Rally's, and the drops get deeper.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:48:18
Ah yeah.. but that will be after the fact.
I'm saying you don't 'know' the future, although you can make an educated guess.
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:55:02
Correct my friend... You have made substantial progress
@_date: 2018-07-12 06:41:27
$19000 to $6000 is a bear market yes. It's not complicated. The standard used to qualify a bear market is 20% fall from peak..  It has yet to be seen if we have reached lows in this bear market and are now basing for a new bull run or if there are new lows to come.
Based on my comment above I believe we will see new lows as long as QT continues.
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:48:59
Yep, looking for an opportunity to short
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:54:13
At least we can agree on Sex Pistols :)
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:34:16
That it's still recovering from a speculative frenzy and is 7 months into a bear market?
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:22:05
Hmm that sounds exactly like Tech stocks ��
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:33:07
Nothing is 100% sure.
That I am 100% sure of

You are well connected with your dogs anus
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:27:37
Mate.. in the past year 'hangry' and 'mansplaining'  have need added to the OED.
Sorry to be the one to break to to you ��
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:00:58
He is definitely responsible for the price falling with his bullish forecast and all ��
@_date: 2018-07-10 20:36:41
Agree with your $4500k prediction (over next 2 months I think)
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:09:18
It is, although when getting paid in Euro if you work in Ireland, they don't generally compare it to USD every week to work out how many Euro to pay you this time.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:28:39
Have opposing market views to you is not trolling.
Your behaviour here seems a little trollish though.
@_date: 2018-07-01 07:32:17
Gdax color scheme equals Lambo?

No authority and no regulation for $btc means no mass adoption on a world scale.
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:28:57
Why should it exactly?
Serious question
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:30:56
Also.. the reverse happens in a bull market.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:01:36
I would absolutely not take advice from a random person online.. just use all the info your get and make up your own mind...
You seem to have a sore spot re contrary options to yours? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 00:13:41
Am.. will somebody tell this guy that 5k only $1500 below the current price? 
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:56:06
Articles that have a different point of view to yours are for sure a bad thing.
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:11:11
My friends..
Your beloved Bitcoin is at the mercy of a QT exercise which has been going on for months.
Until this changes you will not see an end to this bear market.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:03:35
7 months into a bear market, bear markets can have strong Rally's also, but I don't think it's over.
@_date: 2018-07-10 20:39:06
This guy really is gone full retard
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:16:13
'I can't reveal too much '
Lol. ����
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:44:27
You must be able to see into the future? ��
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:57:09
There is a LOT of room for Green Dildos between 6k and 19k, ample opportunity to make a new entry and still be up. Even if you got stopped out at say 15k on the way down, that still leaves lots of time to enter and still be up.
The correct way to do it, if you are a trader, and I'm not saying you are, is to wait for a confirmed bottom which has been tested multiple times and then buy on a breakout with stops in place.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:13:31
You're a real ray of positive light :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:55:49
Absolutely.. the 'noob question' bit is a little suss ��
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:34:48

Can you tell if it's a British smile (crooked teeth) or an American smile (way too white fake teeth)?
This will determine whether I will go long or short.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:02:22
I know, it didn't make sense to me either
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:30:18
The comparisons to the tech bubble if 2000 are legitimate.
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:37:52
I'm saying no, they are not any worse

Never is along time
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:22:29
The internet is not the place for you if you get really annoyed by made-up shorthand.
Also, language evolves based on usage, and 'legit' may very well be in a dictionary soon.
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:36:03
'quite sure'. ..?
Based on what exactly? Tea leaves? A dodgy knee?
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:02:35
Lambo after sun?

That was you? Nice tournament
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:34:20
Holding onto an asset and riding out a 70% correction is madness IMO, theres always another time to re enter.
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:53:24
Brilliant ��
You are funny...  Completely barking mad... But funny.
@_date: 2018-07-17 02:39:29

Hating humanity for market volatility is a sign you are taking this a little too seriously
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:17:48
Is it about a tin foil hat shortage?

This is the best mood I've  seen this forum in for ages.. anyone for a beer?

People often call it manipulation when it doesn't do what they wanted it to do
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:00:29
The sun will probably rise tomorrow
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:14:13
You invent quotes for people aswell as hate humanity for volatile markets?
You may need a hobby :)
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:48:08
You sound quite ..... American
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:53:11
Have you developed a way to see the future?
You have not.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:49:01
There's not much evidence of that apart from internet memes
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:38:14
New lows...
Not a good sign.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:36:10
Your right, I can't argue with those facts you've laid out so clearly, thanks for setting me straight

Central Banks still have all the power
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:30:55
And the fact that it is not more user friendly than cash day to day
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:31:21
You think its gonna take that long?

But.....calm down

With, hey what's happening dude, I'm the guy with the rap for being rude
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:38:06
I believe that when there is another financial crisis Bitcoin will drop based on the fact that there will be a forced liquidation of all assets much like Sept 2008 to March 2009. Assets, Stocks, Commodities all fell, only the USD rose
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:22:33
Nobody can be almost 100% positive about the future direction of Bitcoin

@_date: 2018-12-07 06:13:38
I actually agree.
If you were dumb enough to Hold from 20k down down down to 3.5k you may as well HODL at this stage
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:35:17
Yes, it's complete nonsense, going home from a day still holding is the same as buying that day
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:44:29
