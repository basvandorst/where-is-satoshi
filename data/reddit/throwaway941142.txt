What can you buy with Bitcoins today? Because any currency is ultimately worth it's purchasing power. If you have to convert it to USD or RMB or EUR to buy a gallon of milk, it is merely a speculative instrument, isn't it?
Now if any major player in the debit/credit card business were to provide Bitcoin solutions I would change my stance, but all I see is blind faith motivated by the future of a payout.

How many years since Bitcoin hit 1000? Exactly 4 years. FOUR YEARS. And only a few token companies are accepting it to this day. How many years until it gets credibility? 5? 10? 15? In the mean time the only buzz I get from Bitcoin is how much it is worth or how easily it is traded. No substance, all hype.

The issue is that merchants pay their suppliers and employees and taxes and utilities in local currency.
They can't expose themselves to the risks of a volatile currency.

But what we care about is actual purchases. Nice tulip bulbs though. Keep them because they'll be worth much more in 1638!
