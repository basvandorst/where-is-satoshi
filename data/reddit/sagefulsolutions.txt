Who escrows the transaction? I'm not following. By your example, why wouldn't I give you my account number at my bank, you deposit the money, then I don't give you anything? I'd never do this, but why wouldn't someone who is shady and trying to rip you off?
Is there a trusted BTC escrow service that I should know about?
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:29:34
Wouldn't this be a HORRIBLE thing? The post office would almost certainly ask for ID when doing this and then all the coins are linked to your real identity. Kind of defeats the point of having a system that's pseudo anonymous.
I, personally, would never mix the government up in my bitcoin-related exchange. The NSA probably already has a category in their system, "people who bought our Bitcoin from the USPS." They're just waiting to use it. 
Maybe I'm paranoid, but I doubt it. Not with all the information Edward Snowden and Wikileaks have come out with in recent years. And not considering how much the central banks hate our system because it makes their system worthless. You have to look at the psychology of Bitcoin as well, the psychology behind it at the most basic sense is that we can govern ourselves and deal with money in our own ways instead of relying on an issuing body like the governments or private central banks that are run for profit. And I might add, are the most profitable businesses the world has EVER seen.
Like President Andrew Jackson said, "they are nothing but a den of vipers," that he planned to root out, and he did destroy them before he died even though he had assignation attempts on his life. Props to him and Kennedy.

But maybe it HAS to be that way. If it wasn't difficult and costly, why wouldn't a Bitcoin's price be more in line with Doge, Dark, Lite and other coins? It's that scarcity, I think....

Oh, no doubt. I understand that completely. But it's funny that nobody out of the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people in our community have pegged where those missing THOUSANDS of bitcoin have gone... obviously when you take the appropriate steps, the currency is pretty dang anonymous or it wouldn't take this long to find where they went.
Anonymity isn't my argument, however. My argument is how do we do a MASSIVE campaign educating people how to use Bitcoin correctly?! Why isn't the Bitcoin Foundation or something like that teaching security and how to NOT lose your coins? Is it just a matter of time and millions or billions of dollars coming up missing before people take the time to secure their holdings?! That seems ridiculous. The number one problem with Bitcoin right now is that people think it's just another easier way for hackers to steal your money. I'm from West Virginia, the state with the stupid senator. I've read posts on Facebook from people saying that Manchin is right just for the reason I stated above, because it's just another way for hackers to steal your money. That's a HORRIBLE image for Bitcoin to have, and we need to change it if we're ever to grow any further.

Hey give this dude 100 satoshis because he blew my mind.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:22:20
I understand that, but you can't MINE it. I was a miner in the very beginning, I remember it. I made money from nothing. One of the premises of Bitcoin is to quit letting money control you. How is WORKING for a $900 Bitcoin any different than working for dollars? HELL, Bitcoin is still denominated in FIATs. It's funny to think we are going to get around the system without allowing EVERYONE to mine the currency they need to get things done locally. SKILLS come to mind most prominently. If you have the FIAT to buy lumber somewhere as this takes off in your town, you could pay for LABOR with your local coin because it's value is created by the laborers who WILL use their skills to earn more of it. ON TOP OF MINING for it while they are working for more of it.
In a microeconomy, it seems like the perfect incentive to start spending more. The earth has more than enough to provide us all that we need. Every single one of us, why not give people the means (money) to facilitate the transactions they need to get things done? There are plenty of ideas out there, just not enough money to actualize them and make the dream a touchable reality most of the time. Screw crowd sourcing. MINING IS CROWD SOURCING! It's the digital equivalent to an analog task we are all practically "begging" for now.

I understand, but it seems like a paperwallet generate offline and never entered to "view only" couldn't ever be hacked short of the piece of paper being discovered. Also, a USB wallet that's never made "hot" shouldn't be hackable, correct? Why doesn't everyone do this? Why can't we make it highly recommended and almost mandatory in wallet software to keep anything over $1000 worth of Bitcoin in a cold wallet? Let people take the risk, but at least make them acknowledge they are taking a risk and may lose it. It should be a huge popup disclaimer on every wallet that sees more than $1,000 in a single wallet to move it to an offline storage medium. Make it intrusive, who cares? It needs to be to get the point across. People still make passwords like, "God" "Dog" "cat" "love" "Jesus" and expect nobody to ever crack them. If we're going to have a cryptocurrency-driven world, we're going to have an educated public or it's never going to work.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:40:39
Also, a little review of your history shows you jumped into the DOGEcoin and litecoin craze. 
Sounds like you are still pretty wet behind the ears on crypto and didn't read about Bitcoin on slashdot in 2008 or 2009. I have been around. I remember this project before it got bastardized by all the banking people and speculators trying to get rich. I remember people talking about how this project would set the human race free and promote trusting each other and helping each other and being philanthropic.
Also, most people jump on these new coins for the simple fact THEY can mine them. That's what all these coins are about in the beginning. Why not put local figureheads in charge of these things. Allow people to pay municipal taxes with their specific CityCoin. If you can keep your local governmental infrastructure up and running with a coin ANYBODY can mine for free, why not?! Why?

"What happens when the internet and electric go out and you can't access your money?"
My reply: "Then you can't access your savings, checking account, or investments either. We have bigger problems to worry about if these things happen." 
Same with FDIC. If everyone ever actually NEEDS them, we are in a shitload of trouble because they will have to expand the money supply to give back what you lost because that money has already been put into someone else's hands and invested or spent.
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:13:02
I'm seriously concerned. Not for my money, because it's in cold storage, as you said.
I think the MtGox, Silkroad and other screwups are based on the fact that many many many people know about them and their wallets. I don't see someone who buys 1 BTC and stores it in a Blockchain.info wallet being robbed. Reason being, I do it... and I've not once had problems with Blockchain.info. I know I shouldn't, and everyone can bash me for it, but I trust that site. It's been a long running site and has over a million wallets and I never hear anything bad about them being compromised or anything. Also, with 2FA, it's hard to lose the money anyway, unless the hacker gets ahold of my cell phone, as well.
Lastly, I'm an Ethereum supporter, so I feel your pain on it being so unaccepted here. I can't wait to make a local currency with it once it's out of the alpha stages. I'd love to go around the town "spreading the gospel" and get my local community to be one of the first US-based CRYPTO communities. Forget berkshares that aren't usable in the next town, why not get a community using crypto and then they are exchangeable (in real-time) for another area's currency. Seems like that's the endgame we should all be working toward?

Firstly, Bitcoin is software. If something came along that was proven better and the consensus agreed, they'd roll out the changes in the Bitcoin protocol, making the other coin pointless because it doesn't have the "network effect."
Secondly, Bitcoin will never fall to zero unless a hole is found in the Bitcoin Core. It has too much utility.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:36:17
Hell if I know. I suppose because they are so scared of this maniacal and tyrannical government system we have on this earth, that they don't trust themselves to just generate a new wallet address via blockchain.info on TOR then send all their coins there, and then send them from there to a few more generated addresses and then never combining them all into one address. There's no way to prove who all those other addresses belong to unless you admit to sending them to yourself at a million different addresses.

Because of the Cost of Entry and wild fluctuations in price. I wanted to tie my coin to GOLD and Silver instead of USD. I think the biggest downfall Bitcoin is going to face is being tied to the USD so much.
We need a way to get people to stop thinking the USD is GOD and starting thinking that cryptocurrency could be the savior they are looking for. It frees them from the shackles that the banks have placed on them. It frees them from the corporate espionage by allowing them pseudo-anonymity by default, and FULL anonymity with a few extra measures. This means targeted advertising can go to hell, trying to insurance based on a credit score would be impossible, and correct me if I'm wrong, but how could they tax you if you used cryptocurrency for everything?
Now don't hate me for saying that. I'd be all for taxes if most of them didn't go overseas to the crown of England and weren't used to send all of our decent citizens overseas to fight in stupid wars. I'd love nothing more than to see the BTC replace the USD as the world reserve currency. Right now we fight EVERYONE just to stay the world reserve currency and have the petrodollar. I'm sick of it.
Sorry, ended up ranting. I hold this subject very dear to my heart since I watched Money as Debt, Money Masters, and Endgame/Zeitgeist/America: Freedom to Fascism, and all those documentaries. I see where our monetary policy and system is taking us. It's impossible to sustain this forever and I would love to live in a neighborhood that doesn't have to worry when that system fails because they can still get trade done just as normal. I can see it now, "US Fiat collapses. SagefulSolution's community unaffected."

Not trying to get rich quick at all. I'm trying to create a coin for a municipality and maybe expand it into a regional currency like time-based currency, but we'll use bitcoin as the underlying technology to promote economic growth in our own area instead of labor amongst individuals. Maybe it'll promote the autonomous corporations revolution with the self-driving cars, and such. Who knows? Who cares? I have nothing to lose by doing it, but time that I have plenty of. If it works out, I'll live in the most prosperous place in the world because we will be free from banks thieving from us.
The local area will determine what each is worth and we'll have an economy (even if just an underground one like Bitcoin started) that is outside of the FRN system. A barter system where we don't have to worry about being broke all the time because we live in a small town and not in a big place where Wall Street FRNs are going. We can just fire up our computers and make money! ASICs won't enter the equation in this town for quite some time. I'm in the backwoods with a bunch of rednecks, but bitcoin really is simple enough for the reddest of rednecks. It's scan QR code, enter payment amount, send, done. I think anybody could figure that out.
But, I do have noble intentions. That's for sure.

Just trying to unify things. We need everyone to be on the SAME page. We're decentralizing the IDEA of Bitcoin to too many people. We can't all bring stuffing to Thanksgiving Dinner, or it isn't going to be a very good dinner.
I believe the CORE of the system needs to be trusted to the code that runs the system and not to exchanges and people that can be untrustworthy! Satoshi wrote the paper so that we would depend more on technology and protect it. It's the baby that is going to turn into the most beautiful child that everyone on the face of the Planet has ever seen, if we nurture it correctly. I don't know that we are currently doing that. Everyone got too caught up in the price going up and got further and further from the original mission. TO FACILITATE TRADE WITHOUT ANYBODY TELLING US WHAT THE HELL TO DO!!!!

Bitcoinity reads: "connected users: 5405"
That number has risen from around 5,300 prior to a refresh.

I mean, the earliest adopters are already rich beyond our wildest dreams when this thing hits 68, so why not change the terminology relative to how much it goes up to keep people happy with buying "a whole bitcoin"?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:46:49
Wonderful explanation for people to read! 
I've tried to explain this to so many people that say 21 million units isn't enough. I think people are under this misconception because they don't realize that there are 2.1 (maybe 21?) Quadrillion units in this system. That should be FAR more than enough to accommodate commerce worldwide. If not, it's easy to go a few more decimal places deep and have 21 or 210 quadrillion units.
The only reason for splitting the unit into smaller measurements like this is to not interrupt the value of the base unit, the BTC (the de facto standard in BTC measurement thusfar) because you don't want to create MORE money, you just want to allow the market's corrections of the values to be able to be expressed in smaller denominations for purchases. We will need cents on purchases for the foreseeable future although, maybe not once away from the USD. 
Nothing is stopping us from all pricing things without stupid cents on the price. Maybe something is 21uBTC or 22uBTC or 23 uBTC, but never 24.99 o 29.99 or 27.49. I don't understand why we use change anyway. It'd be very easy for every company to just agree to charge a flat dollar price for everything instead of weird numbers.

Pegging the BTC against the dollar from the very get-go was a HORRIBLE idea. Then again, hindsight is 20/20. I'm just being captain obvious, but to some, it doesn't seem so obvious anymore. Only the early adopters remember the mentality we had when we first discovered crypto. "A WAY FREE OF THESE DAMN GREEDY BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS!" Not so much, anymore.
"Dear Chairman Carper: Thank you for your recent letter requesting information related to virtual currencies. I appreciate this opportunity to comment on the Department of Homeland Se
 (DHS) expertise in this area. The most critical capability for transnational organized crime is to quickly and quietly move large quantities of money across borders. The anonymity of cyberspace affords a unique opportunity for criminal organizations to launder huge sums of money undetected. With the advent of virtual currencies and the ease with which financial transactions can be exploited by criminal organizations, DHS has recognized the need for an aggressive posture toward this evolving trend."
Is it not obvious that everyone that is allowing them to even consider regulating Bitcoin are people who are afraid to leave the Federal Reserve and IRS idea behind? A person scared to get out of the dollar for fear of persecution and guns and jail sentences? 
Personally, I remember when the bitcoin rally was all about using digital money and saying screw the dollar and the system behind it. It was a breath of fresh air, it was FREEDOM. 
This price, that I believe is slowly coming on par with Gold, is turning this into a greed frenzy and where there is greed, there is government. That's a fact. 
We made the biggest mistakes of our lives by (possibly not even purposely thinking about the future at the time) pegging this thing to the USD and how many of those stupid things you can get in exchange for one VALUABLE crypto (value because it's stateless, lawless, and anonymous when used correctly, imho) 
Who cares if you can change it into dollars? It wasn't created so that you could watch something with value erode the value of the thing you are flocking back to! That's like saying in Cyprus you can't wait to change your BTC into worthless cyprus dollars. The USD crash is here, it's been here since before Bitcoin. The dollar has lost 99% of it's purchasing power since 1913!!! FACT.
We HAVE to spread the message that crypto and the dollar are apples and oranges, and NOTHING is MAKING you use the USD other than taxes. So what? Take out what you need, pay your taxes, and be done with it. Pay for everything else in Bitcoin because it's the only way to keep merchants in business in our new cyber economy!! 
Then, I've read mention saying they are going to start taxing purchases made with bitcoin? How are they going to do that when the law can only settle matters involving USD? It's the only "legal tender for all debts public and private" BITCOIN IS NOT. BITCOIN IS A BARTER TRANSACTION! LITERALLY, TO IT'S CORE! You can't sue me because I screw you out of bitcoin because all court cases are settled in USD denominations. That is provided they didn't give you USD in good faith that you'd give them crypto, then it could be taken to court and the statutes apply then. The exchange of the US note(s) is as enforceable as a signed contract in the eyes of the law.
I hope we win this battle against the evil den of vipers that are the central bankers. I hope people will become educated on the things I just spoke of and learn that Bitcoin is the escape, Bitcoin is the get-out-of-jail-free card that we all want in life. It allows us to begin anew. To create an entirely new economy. The ramifications of bitcoin on our world are infinite and more good than bad! Yes, there will be thefts until people figure out the CORRECT way to store their coins, but it's a GREAT technology that I have so so so very much hope for!!!!! :)
Namaste everyone!

In my opinion, it's stable after a few weeks of holding a range of +/-$20 or so. That's when I feel safe from a crash, but it could still happen if something bad happened in the bitcoin universe. There are no guarantees when something is mostly backed by faith of the people spending it.

Shhh... I'm really TRYING to make a good point.

I just think it would be smart to change the value of the Bitcoin relative to the exchange rate, not change the exchange rate relative to the bitcoin terms. Would this cause problems somehow? I'm not an expert in accounting, perhaps it would create problems that I'm not foreseeing, but what are they?!
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:26:24
I love this. I resonate with what you are saying.
If I had money to give you Reddit Gold, I'd give it to you. I've been in this Bitcoin "game" for a LONG time, and I've noticed I've went through several "revelations" myself. I used to be one of those people who thought, "I'm buying in too late... at $5!!!!!!" I bought about 10 coins back then for $50 and gambled them all away on Satoshi Dice and didn't even realize what I was doing!!! :( Now I go back to the gox chart on bitcoincharts.com and see that instead of spending $6,000 on an old Chevrolet car in 2009, I should have spent it on Bitcoin. $4,900 "investment" in 2009 would have made me $38,699,000 right now, if my calculations are correct. If anyone does check my work, please comment back so I know my numbers are correct. The price at Gox when it came online was $0.049 per coin. 
I want to cry every time I think about the perpetual debt I'm stuck in when I could be wealthy enough to have time to do a lot of philanthropic projects I have had in mind for ages. If I had that money, my ideas would be limitless. I mean, they already are, I just wish I could fund the ideas. Haha.
On a side note: That $38M would have allowed everyone to have the same quality car that I bought for myself in 2009, here four years later. If this trend continues, I'm thinking I'm right in buying $5-$10 worth every time I get the chance.

Bitcoin can't be a "sham" as long as you don't sell and everyone else holds as well. It's fun laughing at all the HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! posts, but it's true. Us holding gives it the value and scarcity it needs to be worth more! This in itself is going to drive the VERY rich mad when we all have 1-10 bitcoins on average and they won't be able to have HALF of the wealth we have because too many of us wouldn't sell out to "big brother."  If we all sold, though, they'd be selling for something likt $0.0049 like they were 2 years ago. 
FAITH, that's what hold Bitcoin together. It's what holds the fed notes together, too. Only OUR LABOR gives those stupid piece of paper any value. Now we have figured out a way to cut out the interest and the having to work for that interest to pay it off. Every bit of Bitcoin wealth someone has amassed is now THEIR'S and if the proper precautions were taken, can NEVER be seized or taken against the will of the person who RIGHTFULLY owns that "share." There is no MORAL or SOCIAL cause that justifies you taking my Bitcoin, so what makes you think I'd give it up? That's the kind of mentality I have about Bitcoin. I'm a very early supporter and adopter, however and I have more faith in Bitcoin than 90% of people who didn't get in before $10 or so.

They aren't due for 8 months. We just found out. I'm trying so hard not to act on emotion! We aren't DESPERATE, but if I saw that $2k evaporate, I'd be devastated that I didn't do the "right thing" for my kid.

How do you pay taxes on a plumbing fix for a tooth repair? Do they want 15% of the mercury-silver amalgam and 15% of the tape used in the plumbing repair? If no dollars were exchanged, and you have NO dollars, how do you pay taxes? This is stupider than a dog chasing it's tail!

You're trying to say those things make my coins worth $340 a piece. That's not true. The Chinese buying up so many because they have more faith in them than the dollar is what drives price. Nobody even has a clue EXACTLY how much power is being used in kilowatt hours nor does physics make it worth anything. If that was the case, bumble bees should be worth trillions because they break the laws of physics by being able to able to fly.

It is logged, it just doesn't matter because the two people who transacted, sent to newly generated addresses, (that's a rule of bitcoin usage anyway) which allowed the transaction to be as anonymous a cash transaction. 
In other words, only the two that agreed to send the money to each other, know who the other is, and vice versa. The only bad thing about the method is it doesn't fall in-line with the saying, "Dead men tell no tales."
I suppose if you could meet up via TOR and somehow trust each other, it would be the simplest way to mix coins without meeting face to face or running them through tumblers. As long as you send the coins to another address that hasn't also been accessed by the same IP, I don't know how they could ever build a case against you. Not trying to help people launder money, I mean, I don't even do my own laundry.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:58:49
Did the same thing. Bought about 20 coins when they were $5 and then proceeded to gamble them away with Satoshi Dice because they just seemed like cool "game tokens" at the time. Shoot me in the face! I lost over $15,000!
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:17:27
We don't want the term to be common, is my point. Psychology, brother. We don't want people thinking it costs $1000 to buy the most basic unit of our currency! :) Right now, that's what every Tom, Dick, and Harry think it costs. We need the BITcoin to always be the most basic measure of money, just as you can't get any smaller than a BIT in data.

I'd trust MYSELF with a centralized system. I'm not a greedy son of a bitch like a "banker." I want my house, a decent car, and food on my table for my family. As long as I have that, I don't need to make anymore from my efforts of centralizing it. I'm entrepreneurial, anyway. I'd find a way to automate that centralization and run it at the bare minimum fee possible to pay electric or server costs for maintaining a site that keeps a ledger of gold in reserve.
Perhaps I could use the bitcoin that I already have, and start a sort of "bank" (I use that word VERY VERY VERY VERY LOOSELY) that will buy your gold for Bitcoin and then that makes the Bitcoin that I issue out in my community inherently backed by gold that they could purchase back and exchange for USD at a pawn shop or wherever, if they so chose. 
Maybe that's a better approach? I've thought of doing it that way, too. Just figured an altcoin that isn't so highly valued right now would be a better entry-point for newbies. I suppose they could always purchase Satoshis instead of whole BTCs.

@_date: 2013-11-11 08:04:17
So I need to duplicate litecoin instead, I suppose? It has Scrypt and ASICs don't currently work on it, right? 
I suppose I could put our BTC blockchain on a VPN and since I own an IT company, offer to set people up on the citywide VPN for a very cheap price. That would keep the ASICs out. (other than if someone local decided to buy one) I could even generate a little work for me in that way. :) This is a win-win-win situation for everyone if I could pull it off.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:06:06
Only making a point that the thing is growing at MUCH larger rates than any OTHER "investment" so the people saying it's a bad investment, are simple minded.
The proof is right here of that statement. I'm glad people are accepting Bitcoin, I've been into it since '09-'10 when I heard about it on slashdot!!!! Talk about the good 'ol days. lol Too bad I never bought any up when I learned about them then! I just figured they'd end up like WoW Gold or SecondLife money. lol Oh well, I got in while they were still around $5 and got a little stockpile. It's tiny, but it's enough to smile when $5-$10 changes come! :)
Hope everyone is doing well!
Also, I compiled my data by using bitcoincharts.com/charts/ with percent change turned on, and used the daily scale while using custom dates (i.e. 1/1/13 - 1/31/13, 2/1/13-2/28/13, etc) I wanted the most accurate number I could come up with while keeping from dropping into bars whose widths are so small, you can't get a very good idea of the percentage. I compared the smaller scale graphs to the daily, and they were roughly the same +/- 5%.

Bitcoin is an infant, it doesn't know what it's doing yet. It's learning though, that's the cool part about it. It learns because each and every brain of a human that is involved makes decisions whether to buy or sell, thereby placing  a vote in the system and giving it value to do other things with it. It's doing very well for how new it is. It does very well considering probably less than 1% of the world even know what it is...

Sheesh. I guess I'll just hold onto the couple I have because I'm not jumping through a bunch of hoops to get them.
What's keeping someone from doing it without all the hoops to jump through? Why can't anybody just accept moneypak without Paypal? Can I not go to my local Wal Mart and use their service with someone who also has a Wal Mart nearby? I think I always used Moneygram with BitInstant? Still possible, isn't it? Then Wal Mart gives you the cash, and you send the customer their coin? Hell, you could even keep a PUBLIC wallet showing the amount you have up for sale to prove it's there. It's not proof you will SEND them, but it's proof that you have them, until you sell them enough, then it's proof that you are a man of your word...?
I bet people already do this via local bitcoins and I'm thinking I'm some kind of genius or something. lol
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:36:37
What a wonderful solution, either way. I love having to keep people that don't belong on welfare alive.
And people wonder why people want Bitcoin to be anonymous. At least you could dodge this retarded stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:42:58
From following this subreddit and a few other sources, my gut tells me to hold because the train is just starting to get momentum. If billionaires start dumping money into this thing, we could end up at over $10k/coin in NO TIME FLAT! I read somewhere Rothschild's are taking note of Bitcoin, and when it hit the $10B market cap, it became a feasible investment for Wall Street types... makes me want to hold so bad!
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:38:13
I hear ya. I'm already in the negatives in what I have invested in Bitcoin. I'm just trying to decide when I'm being greedy and when it's smart to take the money and run. I don't want the USD, to be honest. I hate all the fiat currency. I watched documentaries like Money Masters and Money as Debt when I was only 12 or 14 myself. I know how money works. I know how we're being fucked by the banks that manipulate everything. I believe in Bitcoin so very much, it's why it's hard to decide if it's time to take some of my gains and lose out on TEN TIMES that amount that it would have gained in value when I actually need it. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:31:02
That comes with a HUGE price discrepancy from the exchanges, though. I really miss the old days. Government intervention has made buying these things ridiculously harder than it already was. (and it was hard for non-tech folks when I thought it was easy)
Thanks for the reply, though! :(
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:22:41
The sooner you would have ordered the more BTC you would have spent. That's not a better deal. Anything that keeps BTC in YOUR wallet is a better deal. The higher the price against USD the less BTC you spend.
The rule of thumb: SPEND on things when high, BUY coin when low. ;) That's been my strategy.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:33:48
Knowing I could do all three of those things I mentioned, or blow it now to have a little $2,000 safety net? 
Sounds like a pretty big decision to me. I could wake up tomorrow and have NOTHING in Bitcoin. I don't think it would happen because I'm more of a bitcoin believer than most. 
I'm just so scared I'll ruin the great childhood my kid could have with that $2,000 safety net or if I go through with it, I could be kicking myself in the ass for not buying us all a house and everything with the same savings I blew for a measly $2k here in a few years if it hits $10k or $100k.

But why? Why would I want a portfolio with anything other than bitcoin? They are all inflationary, and it's stupid. Why play all the games and arbitrage between currencies and such? Why not just work and be productive for a living instead? And if you're intelligent enough to make money in the stock market, you're damn smart enough to amass enough wealth to start one of the first bitcoin startups and make millions (billions when all is said and done?). I just don't understand why ANYBODY is holding onto the dollar. Name a feature that the dollar has that I can't SOMEHOW do with Bitcoin, then turn around and do the same with Bitcoin vs the dollar... the chart would be largely on the side of Bitcoin, hands down.

The crazy fluctuation in price and the dramatic losses that happen when bubbles are popping would scare the average Joe where I'm from. They would see their money evaporate and sell off, they ARE used to the stock market, after all where you lose EVERYTHING when something crashes.
I'm used to it, personally. I've been holding since $5, so it's no big deal. I realize I'm in the midst of revolutionary technology. It's going to take it a while to find it's value. In doing so, there are going to be bubbles over and over until they become so frequent that they are unnoticeable. 
This is equilibrium I'm theorizing of, when the up's and downs are at such high frequency they are undetectable because they happen every millisecond. People can move $1M in and not affect the price and then move $1M out and not affect the price because it's market cap value is so high that a million dollars is just a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things.
Fluctuations are the reason I'd rather have some altcoin backed by something real. Real Estate, Gold, Silver, a car title, etc.

Valuing MY "product" against gold instead of shitty fiat is illegal now? 
Maybe I should kill myself if I'm not at least free enough to value my "product" in whatever denomination I want to? Sheesh. I thought I was in the freest country in the world. I see that I'm not if you are correct.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:09:56
To be honest, the PEOPLE directly decide the value of these things. You know what is going to make them go up? Knowing that if you need to buy a house, and you keep buying small amounts over time, you're going to get to that house a lot faster than waiting on your wages at work to make you money. I've gained a lot of profit in the past week. More than I could make working at my job. I'm not saying it's going to keep growing exponentially forever, but until people stop pumping their fiat into this new monetary unit, it's going to keep going up. I don't feel a bubble anymore. I rode through the April one and watched almost $1,100 evaporate into about $150 in A DAY. You do that, and then tell me if you can't tell a bubble when it's coming. I really don't feel it. I've felt NO tension in the bitcoin community that was near the likes of April!
It's going up. Buy what you can afford or replace a bad habit's costs with Bitcoin acquisition. You won't regret it. Either way you either made a buttload of money, or you quit a bad habit. Congrats on either scenario!
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:45:08
NO! You're completely missing the point.
If you buy 1 bitcoin for $100 and then wait till it goes to $200, you effectively have saved $100 because you now only have to spend .5BTC to get that $100 item.
Where's there any flawed logic in that?
It sounds like you're saying it's best to spend your money when the Bitcoin is LOWER, that's incorrect. You couldn't even buy something worth $100 if the bitcoin you bought at $100 is now worth $80, for example. You sound confused, to me.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:36:03
Nobody is going to care about Bitcoin in the mainstream if it costs them $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 PLUS the cost to PURCHASE all the materials in the moon to HAVE ONE.
Everybody around here is so good with economics (or so they thing) but SUCK with human psychology. I'm trying to bring a psychological problem up that everybody that has 1 BTC in their pocket doesn't care about. The fact is, the price is dropping because no new blood is going to come into a system at $1,000 or THREE PAYCHECKS to buy in and have ONE of the most basic unit of measure. Don't tell me Satoshi is the most basic unit, because if that were true, we'd have started selling Satoshis for $0.0000000000001 instead of selling the MOST valuable unit first. That's stupid. If Apple sold it's 6th generation iPad that it's already developed, it would never sell the ones before it. That's STRATEGY. Always have the next steps invented for you. We're trying to get people buy in KNOWING full good and well that people already have some and they are too late to the game to "own a bitcoin." Maybe with a little reverse-psychology, we could get more people in and make this thing a prominent way of paying out bills, and everything else.

I understand where you are coming from, I genuinely do. I just can't seem to compare something this worldview-changing to ANYTHING historically to say it's not a good way to go. Bitcoin is the most unchartered waters we've entered, economically, since JFK implemented the silver standard and got assassinated. What are they going to do to something they can't shoot or take down? So far it appears to be nothing, so there is NOTHING else to stop Bitcoin that I can foresee. It's already adopted VERY heavily in Cyprus, all over Europe, and China. We have NO idea what this is going to do. I know one thing, if it gets a couple trillion market cap, it'll put some governments and banks out of business unless they invested in it early.

Amen to that! I think we ALL regret not getting in sooner! It doesn't matter who you are. And to think, the original person didn't just unleash this system and already have the ASICs figure out and mine the crap out of it.
It was just created and then left by it's creator(s). That's awesome that someone did this for the world. It almost gives me butterflies to know someone has done something that is going to change the world for all of our progeny! :)
Maybe we are really in the midst of ap paradigm shift and the monetary reform was the first barrier to overcome. I've always said it was the first thing we needed to overcome as as the human race. I think this is it, guys, we finally have our own currency to make worth WHATEVER WE SEE FIT! The more dollars we dump in, the more we all get to share this new wealth that is stronger than ANY central banking currency in the world! DEFLATIONARY CURRENCY. HOW DID WE ARRIVE HERE?! :)

That's what I'm saying! Let's keep the thing everyone wants (BECAUSE they're stupid and don't know it's divisible) at the lowest cost. ONE BITcoin should now be worth $0.732 and it DOES NOT have to be pegged to one currency anymore than the current measures don't have to be pegged to one. (as someone said in these comments that it would somehow mess up the pegging to different currencies... not true.) If you held three "BITcoin" at the time of the change, you're credited with THREE THOUSAND bitcoin... oh wow, that's easy to understand... it's moving the decimal the other way to keep people buying in low where they can afford it. You don't have to deal with teaching them new vernacular, because only the early adopters would ever have megaBTC, gigaBTC, etc. They would KNOW what the hell those computer terms were, because they were nerdy enough to get in it in the first place. (this is coming from an Early Adopter, by the way) I got into mining before they were even convertible to USD. There was no exchange. I thought it was the ultimate idea before Mt Gox was ever even licensed to do business. I'm not bragging, I'm just making a point that people like me, KNOW what the data terms are. We are geeks. We grew up with technology. We know what it can do. We know where it can take us.

@_date: 2013-11-23 03:01:40
I'm liking what you are saying, and I follow your logic. I'd just really like to know if it's true or not. I still think it falls under bartering... THAT is the loophole we are looking for; How do you "exchange" items (bitcoin for something) without "bartering"? 
Sounds like a word that someone should see how far they could twist the legal definition of. If you could PROVE you were not "bartering" the tax code doesn't apply to what you are doing as far as I know.
