That's a rough story.  But it's a good example why none of us should live in the past.  A similar situation as your brother, I had 300,000 shares in a penny stock company back in 2011.  It floundered for months and months.  Along comes a fortune 500 company and buys them out literally the day after I sold.  I bought into all the fud that the buyout was just a rumor.  I would have made millions. Ancient history.  Like your brother, I was inconsolable for weeks.  Especially with my dad making fun of me constantly for wasting my money on the stock market. So I get.  I wish your brother wouldn't have withdrawn from his support system.  That's the worst mistake we can make when we're depressed.

Wow, BART incoming. This is going to be ugly.

Sorry for not being your fellow shill. I'll try harder.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:46:54
Well, this sub used to ban people just for saying something like "I don't think bitcoin is a viable currency." Now that the bubble burst and all the btc fanatics left to find an actual job, you're left with people who are actually allowed to express their opinions. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:58:13
Don't forget about the "I'M NOT SELLING" wolf of wallstreet meme. So glad those days are gone. Just nothing but mindless shilling. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:39:14
You never understood people presenting opinions from both sides. So you are one of the shills who roped normies into buying this overpriced turd and then they lost all their money. Now you wonder why everyone isn't a shill, just like you. Grow up.

That's a difficult concept for someone who bought into the hodl meme.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:35:44
Read my previous posts. Of course there's serious investors in bitcoin. They're the ones driving the price down so they can accumulate. Because they know in 5-10 years bitcoin will be a useful currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:24:40
Here comes the BART!  Are you ready?
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:22:16
you mean the chart that shows it moving sideways? yeah, I see that too. It's a set up for the BART and there is no indication that it will go up. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:21:35
Those lambo kiddies are the only ones keeping the price from plummeting to $3k. They put their entire life savings into this bloated turd and are fully invested in the hodl meme.

We're talking about entirely different market conditions now. Bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency. It's mainstream. As such, it's being weighed and tested as an investment. When the bubble popped, bitcoin was divested by all the normies who fomo'd in and now it's being collected institutionally because in a few years you'll start to see mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:39:37
What's a macro economic stock?  You mean a fund or and ETF? Maybe the Vix? Basically, with BTC, I'm looking for stability at certain price levels, because when that happens you won't see as much volatility. The more BTC is adopted as viable currency within our macro economy the more it will stabilize.  The primary obstacle to being more widely adopted by large market cap companies is volatility.  When you're a company doing 10s of thousands of transactions a day, the fluctuations in price are simply too risky. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:59:50
Banks don't deal with Bitcoin, exchanges do. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:41:11
Reading comprehension, bro.  "Intangible factors" not assets.  Unquantifiable factors. Basically, it's the value that you can't see on an earnings report. I don't know that either of us can comprehensively say what BTC is or isn't, at this point. It's certainly more than just a currency that operates outside the confines of government regulation. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:03:42
Look at the charts.  It's trending up, in a very big way.  You said the word "invest" and not "trade." That implies you're going to buy and hold. Personally, as far as an investment goes, I think in a less than 5 years we'll see BTC at $30k-$50k per coin. So yeah, I think you're safe to invest at these levels. But before you invest, you need to know, inside and out, what you're investing in.  Do some research, look at some charts.  Do you own due diligence.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:28:47
Turns out Bitcoin ain't going no where. It's here to stay.
@_date: 2017-09-24 04:37:54
Deposit cash into seller bank account, seller sends bitcoin to your wallet. The bank is not involved in the transaction. This is why Dimon and the rest the bankster scum feel threatened. It eliminates their ability to make money off your transactions.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:46:24
Well, we had kept things fairly civil up until now.
 Do you really not know about the FED? You know it's not run by democratically elected officials, right?  You know it's never been audited, right? It operates outside any sort of judicial oversight. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:46:32
Ok.  But I don't see the logic in shorting at that level.  90 day chart:up 75%, 120 day chart: up 335%, 1 year chart: up 1200%.  Do you see a trend? And this is trending up even in the face of the most unscrupulous naysayers. There's a common saying among investors and traders; "know what you own." BTC is a currency, commodity and stock all rolled into one.  We haven't even scratched the surface of its value. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:47:46
2 years ago people said it would never go to $1000. It was a scam, it wasn't real, blah blah blah.  Then, people said it would never go to $2000.  See, these people didn't grasp the true potential of what BTC has become and will become. It has grown exponentially, over the past year and will continue to do so as it becomes more mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:49:33


Oh, he understands it.  That's why he's trying to undermine it. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:30:36
Bro, I'm not whining about anything.  Shit, I know how good I have it.  As a matter of fact, I know first hand because I've traveled extensively.  My only point is, the U.S. dollar and the powers that control it are beyond corrupt. Bitcoin, to me, is a far more honest and transparent currency than anything I've seen.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:56:37
Yeah, the name value, the fact that it can be utilized in so many different ways due it's unhindered, unregulated nature. Let's not underestimate market share either, of which BTC is undisputed leader. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:03:48
I've been watching this resistance at 3800 for a few hours now.  I think if we can break 4000, we'll see the chart go back towards 4500 pretty quick.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:53:32
You do realize that big banks are operating in a completely separate and  false market, right? They will come crashing down, just as the dollar will. There's a very good reason that the FED will not allow itself to be audited. It's a house of cards. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:15:25
Eh, I'm a chart guy.  Been an active stock trader for 20 years. Usually the support levels act as resistance on the way back up and during the sell off of the past few days it dropped past 4000 like it was nothing. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:55:10
Oh, I thought is was a spelling error "shock" for "stock." Personally, I think BTC has some very particular strengths that a sector like big banking does not have. BTC has the potential to operate as its own currency separate from dollars. It has the potential to gain its value from transactional flexibility and mulifunctional abilities. In other words, you can do a lot more with BTC than you can with cold hard cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:54:41
Do you know what due diligence is? It's what separates the losers from the winners. You should try it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:15:54
If you invest now, you won't have to remortgage. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:23:18
I can see I'm talking to an extremely blue-pilled individual.  There's no sense in continuing this conversation.     
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:21:27


No they don't. People use exhanges to sell bitcoin and get fiat. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 23:44:55
Amazon has a lot to lose using bitcoin given the volatile nature of the price movement. Until they are able to do transactions in which they receive the bitcoin and instantly convert to fiat, it's simply too risky.  Given that they do tens of thousands of transactions per minute. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:18:51
The average consumer won't purchase a coin at it's current price.  The average consumer doesn't purchase full coins, they purchase units of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:40:03
Of course BTC has intrinsic value, not least of which is its ability to function outside the scope of regulated currencies.  Ok, so you don't approach BTC as an investment.  That's your prerogative, however, I think flipping it is a lot more work and stress than just riding the trend over the next several years.  There's no way to flip without also taking some heavy losses.  No one always trades for profit.  That's part of the risk.  But investing in BTC given it's massive upside potential is simply a no brainer.  Then again, I'm probably much older than you with different goals and a different approach to assets. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:14:12
Well, as they say; charts don't lie. As far as intrinsic value related to investing I'll leave this: "The intrinsic value is the actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, in terms of both tangible and intangible factors."  Notice, intangible factors such as BTC's ability to be a multi-use, transactional tool. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:15:33
As I pointed out a few days ago, the resistance was at 3800, according to support/resistance levels on the 90 day chart. We stayed right around 3800 for a couple days. Some were saying that 4000 would be the resistance but, as you can see, we pushed through that fairly easily. 
Next resistance point is 4350 then 4850.
