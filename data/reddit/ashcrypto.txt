Why is not possible on LN?

I guess it would seem thru segwit. Without it it's not possible.

I think that it allows the use of blockspace it doesn't actually have.

Here is what he said: "Are you deaf or just stupid?  If you fractionally reserve BLOCKSPACE what you are counterfeiting Is BLOCKSPACE.  Without blockspace you cant transact, period.  Blockspace is liquidity in crypto.   Please listen next time."

I've seen him bash csw too.

Lol. The "justice system" is a mockery.

Doesn't make any sense unless he knows who satoshi is.

i like zero conf
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:46:15
Agreed. He either knows/knew satoshi or is him.

...No one would claim to be satoshi unless 
A) they were satoshi  
B) they're friends with and have an agreement with satoshi 
C) they knew satoshi was dead, period!
am I missing anything?
