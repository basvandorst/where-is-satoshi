Because it's a stupid meme, that's why the downvote. Not everyone likes memes.

TitaniumBackup is great for this. I have backed up and restored Google Authenticator this way numerous times.

I'm glad is still full of quality posts and threads.

That's a rash generalization. Not all apps transfer between major upgrades. But to say that TB won't do it 100% of the time is just plain wrong.

Admitting any weak points would make the circlejerk explode.

What an absurdly elitist and circlejerk type response.

Yea, those 6 people are going to be pissed they missed you cross posting something to your own sub reddit.

Ah ok, I thought that was a Windows feature/file/dll that I had not heard of.

Since I require the blockchain.info app to decode my key, what happens when/if that site goes away?

Also available on [F-Droid](
Which is all open source software. Highly recommended supplement to the Play Store.

That is what I assumed. But everyone saying that it will NEVER pay for itself, is annoying. 
Potential 6 month or even a year payoff doesn't mean "it's not really going to pay for itself."

Pretty easy. Shouldn't take more than an hour, at most, including imaging CentOS

I updated to 0.8.0 and launched my normal shortcut, which adds -datadir=B:\ to the mornal bitcoin-qt.exe. And it says unable to read and unable to replicate the block index. Even on a blank directory. Once I run it as just the default, without -datadir=, then it runs fine. Even after letting %appdata% default folder get the whole blockchain updates, copying that to my -datadir= directory, I still receive the same error.

It technically can happen at 50.0000000000000000000000001% or however many 0s you can count. Easier to annotate as 51%

Alright, info incoming.
B:\ is just a mapped network drive. It's where I stored all my &lt;0.8.0 Bitcoin data. And I updated to 0.8.0 and used the same shortcut to launch it as I did with &lt;0.8.0
Shortcut is


The first error message I get is


With options for OK and Abort. Abort closes, and exits. OK gives me


And the only option there is OK, which shuts it down.
I get a debug.log in b:\ which is






























db.log is empty.
B:\database contains a 10MB file 'log.0000000001'
B:\blocks\index contains 0MB 'LOCK' and 'LOG'
I can replicate the error whether B:\ is empty, contains only my wallet.dat, or if it has my &lt;0.8.0 data in it. All the scenarios give this as an error.
I deleted the network drive folder where B:\ points to, just in case there was a lingering hidden file or something. Same error.
I can launch with this shortcut, and it works fine.


Aldo, pointing to D:\ (which is a local, physical disk) works fine.


Launching bitcoin-qt.exe with no arguments at all, it runs fine to the default directory.
I have also mapped Y:\ to a different network location, and receive the error. It appears to give me errors anytime I use a datadir that is a mapped network location.

That photo slideshow on the main page is WAY too fast. Slow it down.
@_date: 2013-02-21 13:14:25
Possibly, but it worked just fine before 0.8.0
So, something changed in the 0.8.0 update to break it.

How? I put one in at 336 mhash, 5 watts, and it says break even ~22 weeks. So After 5-6 months-ish it's profit.

A bit of an over-exaggeration, but some printers save a record of everything they print. And some printers report statistics, and potentially the original print job image, to the manufacturer.

Some people are selling because it gets money into the exchanges faster. For instance, it's quicker to sell 5 BTC now, rather than wait 2+ days for a wire transfer. Sell now, hope it goes low, and buy, without having to wait for bank transfers.

I get errors anytime I use -datadir switch. Anyone else run into this issue?

It's also offline storage. Your private key is never stored on a computer for anyone to access. That's the benefit, not to have something to hold in your hand. It's an alternative to leaving your wallet and keys on a computer that may get compromised and stolen.
