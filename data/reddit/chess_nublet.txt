That’s not even possible since 1.5 million satoshicoins are stuck in cryolock

You’re a very smart man. Investing in an asset class that decreases in value to zero in almost every case as time goes to infinity.

By being the one that created the puzzle.

You mean the amount of electricity they steal.

Who is talking about gains? You just said store of value. That implies that after some time the value is relatively the same or better. We aren’t talking about an investment, merely a way to store value.
Also, the inverse of an 80 percent loss is not an 80 percent gain. In order to recover from an 80 percent loss you need a 400 percent gain.

If I wanted to store value I wouldn’t put it in an asset that loses 80% in the span of a year.

That doesn’t shut them up, it just makes you look like a fool for offering a bet that isn’t a real bet because the one offering has nothing to lose and the one accepting has nothing to gain.

Yes, that is abundantly clear, and I’m saying it isn’t clever or witty at all if the point is to “shut them up”.  It just makes you look like a retard.

Offering to send someone $10 for an unlikely event versus offering to take thousands of dollars for a likely event. The odds are completely uneven here and only a fool would think this is how to ”shut up a nocoiner.” It’s a “heads I win, tails you lose” proposition.
