yeah, its becoming more and more clear to me the bitcoin i once loved has been infiltrated by people who are going to turn it into something for the mainstream. I'm not pushing the bc ash narrative here, i'm equally critical of them.
It is appearing to me that once bitcoin gets mainstream acceptance, it is going to lose its ideals and integrate with the current financial system. 
We were not supposed to have ETF's and the NYSE running an exchange. Bitcoin is anti-banker and anti-fiat.
Looking back, I can see the problem started long ago, by pegging bitcoins price to USD. That was a necessary evil in order to determine its value, but it was the trojan horse that will lead to it not reaching its full capability.

One of the things I have loved about crypto is that it has opened up new opportunities for business, even something as simple as being a broker on p2p exchanges.
Is there going to be an business opportunity by opening and managing LN channels for willing participants?
edit: spoke too soon, after reading the information you all linked my head is spinning with ideas. thank you
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:41:35
yeah, sorry meant to type WW2. 
if we start to see a large amount of capital short bitcoin this could be further evidence for what is happening
bitcoin is resilient to attack and will pull through. buy when blood is in the streets :)

just to remind you 1 week later, go fuck yourself, traitor. go use some fiat
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:31:24
It is fucking amazing it is not begging. I've been a member of this community longer than probably any of you knuckleheads who responded. This is a cause we need to champion both from a PR perspective and from a value perspective.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:31:49
In the USA we are. That is what we are fighting with Bitcoin. If you aren't in it for real GTFO.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:31:34
You fucking moron, everything is 100% verifiable, why don't you look it up and read a bit about it. We already have a tyranical gov in the US and that is what bitcoin is fighting
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:53:51
GTFO of bitcoin. We don't need pussies we need brave men who aren't scared of the gov'. If you decide you just want to back down, go use FIAT
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:32:56
If your not in the fight for freedom for real then GTFO. Bitcoin isn't for bitches. It is for those who want freedom. This is a cause that should be championed from our community

No, I was just stating that TA does indeed work, and people make their living using it. TA is not about predicting the future. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:02:11
There are many people out there who disagree with you, and make their living based off TA in both crypto markets and other financial markets. 
I'm suprised nobody has pointed out, you basically state: "just buy and hold, value will double".  Your value only doubles in USD. For those who are true crypto believers, we like to earn crypto. TA is a viable way of doing so. If you want a good primer, babypips is a good place to start
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:32:33
Go use fiat the real crypto community doesnt want you pussy. Did you even look to see what it is? I'm not affiliated to it in any way. I donated and did my part. I stand up for my rights, and wont let anyone take them from me. They can try and ill fight
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:33:55
You are arguing semantics. The USA was overtaken in a COU when the federal reserve act was passed in 1913.
It is fucking mind blowing, check my post history. I stand up for bitcoin all day long in the forked coins sub and try to educate them. But this thread really makes me think they might be right. How can you guys seriously not champion this cause? A bunch of weak ass bitches in here right now, where the real crypto community at?
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:26:51
I speak the truth, and the truth is you are a moron. The cause is NOT mine, for the multiple time. 
If you evaluate any cause based on the messenger, you sir are a fool, and it is a practice I advise you to drop.
Inalienable rights in the constitution: 
I keep repeating myself: The US GOV today is not what the country was founded on. Bitcoin has the power to spread freedom throughout the world. 
If you are not on board with these causes, why the fuck are you here? So you can HODL? Make some money? 
True crypto believers are the sons of liberty in the modern sense
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:23:21
you fucking moron, the money isn't going to me. i already donated and am passing on the link. a company called defense distributed. here is the link 
they created a repository, like github is for code, for 3d printed guns. they won a settlement with the state department after years of legal challenges and were able to create their repository.
a federal judge in washington invalidated their settlement with the state department, so they are going back to court and need all the help they can. this is a first and second amendment issue and it is an issue that bitcoin should be championing
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:10:39
Its an admittance of guilt without saying anything
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:52:59
I can't believe i am talking to people in the bitcoin sub.
The constitution says these are INALIENABLE RIGHTS!!!!
WE CURRENTLY HAVE A CORRUPT GOV THAT HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR DECADES
BITCOIN IS A FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH WHAT I LINKED, DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE 1ST AND 2ND AMENDMENT
@_date: 2018-10-26 01:02:31
bitch made, i'm not new to bitcoin, and I am not a communist. I'm an anarcho capitalist. You can fuck off too, I could give a shit how you use your bitcoins, and that is the point of it. But 3d printed guns are essential to americans keeping the 2nd amendment alive. We dont need to register our guns to the state.
1 more time - go fuck yourself pussy
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:15:37
my speech lol, how the fuck u gonna tell how long a person has been involved with bitcoin based on speech from a throwaway account.
and i have no desire to make you do anything at all. i give 0 fucks about u

So, you are telling me it is impossible for Abra to freeze funds, stop transactions? I don't think so. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 00:03:03
Your a bankster pawn, the bitcoin revolution will soon forget you
@_date: 2019-02-02 14:23:36
Sent you a PM. Looking to connect with fellow crypto entrepreneurs
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:38:26
You are 100% certain on this? Just did a bit of reading, and I may stand corrected! 
I am very concerned about the future of Bitcoin with mainstream integration, controling your own keys is so important. If anyone can freeze or prevent a transfer, then you don't really own the Bitcoin. 
I am very skeptical of banking institutions. But I hope this is all true, and it really is a peer to peer model as they say
@_date: 2019-02-13 00:32:58
We don't need banks people wake the F up!!!!!!!! The promise of bitcoin is YOU get to be your own bank. Not your keys, not your coins. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 19:07:05
you dont make any sense, why do i do what? make a post bringing awareness to rights being taken away one small inch at a time? and point out that people can use there bitcoins to help defend their own rights?
fuckin clwon man u just tryna argue
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:48:30
You are afraid to keep your coins anywhere outside of coinbase? 
That statement invalidates your entire claim
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:17:45
We track criminals financial data, AFTER they are suspected or charged with a crime. As part of an investigation. The law enforcement agency files a warrant and sends it to the company requesting information.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:12:45
I'm cool with it. So will the majority of people who have been in crypto when it was sub 1k. The mainstream media can crush it all they want. Trust in the main stream media is at very low levels. Also, I only speak for myself, but I would guess that the majority of people who are in crypto sub 1k don't put too much stock in the main stream media either
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:44:33
Support isn't a myth. Neither is resistance. CNBC isn't the best source. Finding support is something you should do yourself. It's also something that is more of a zone, rather than a hard number. 
"Bitcoin has no support because it has no fundamental value"
Regardnig the above statement, what you doing in a bitcoin subreddit if you believe it has no fundamental value?
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:29:02
The federal government very much cares, and I plan to grow this to 7 figures one day. I need to be legal from day one so I don't lose everything I worked to create
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:30:00
I am not doing anything that could be viewed as illegal. I want to run a business and make money, not end up in jail. All it takes is a google search to see plenty of people who "hustled away" and ended up getting arrested for not doing it the right way
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:44:27
the tether claims are highly suspect in my opinion, and i'm not new to crypto at all
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:22:46
The dilemma always appears somewhere! 
I would guess, that for a crime to occur there has to be a victim. (I don't believe victlimless crimes should be considered crimes). 
In the financial world, this would mean that someone has lost money through force or fraud or theft of some sorts. 
The victim would contact the authorities and provide the information necessary. 
Based on the information the victim provides, should be a good starting point for where to gather more evidence
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:13:22
Doesn't cost $10 to send btc. 
Nobody should keep coins on coinbase, you are basically "leasing" coins you do not have full ownership over your coins until you get them out
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:14:10
The issue many people run into is this: "I am not doing anything illegal, so I don't have to worry". 
We think they will take action against criminals and leave law abiding citizens alone. Unfortunately this isn't the case
@_date: 2018-11-02 17:10:49
As an anarcho capitaliast i have 0 desire to tell anyone at all what to do with there time there is a difference between making suggestions and strait up demanding people follow orders

6k is where support was if i recall, the last drop in feb i believe was around 6k
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:28:55
these posts don't do anything to advance bitcoin. they should be included in the type of posts that get people banned

Hello anarchocapitalist :) I love that ideology. I am a libertarian, and a free market capitalist. So naturally, anarchocapitalism is very appealing to me. Only the strong should survive, like nature intended. The world isn't supposed to be "everyone gets a trophy". 
Being a libertarian, free market capitalist. And being involved with crypto for many many years now. I too do not understand his motivations. I really believe the man has ulterior motives.
