I can see a lot of people being unhappy with this and others will be very pleased. Either way there's no good outcome here. Have you any leads on who performed this attack or how it happened? (obviously not asking for specifics at this stage)
Also, what are your honest thoughts about remaining a viable exchange now this has happened and making everyone whole again?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:24:33
So there is progress being made at least? Thanks for your tireless efforts by the way.
Full disclosure, I've got no skin in this game (nothing on BFX at the time) but it could have just as easily happened to me too. Hope it all works out for everyone - including you guys - in the end
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:42:00
Because that's the point of bitcoin, to run without governance or someone saying, hey, that doesn't suit us, lets wind it all back. This is why Ethereum is in such a mess at the moment. Once you do that, where do you draw the line? Oh, shall we allow 28 million coins? Etc, etc
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:12:18
Sadly too late, feel sorry for ya mate :(

You in Adelaide? I think I know what gym
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:21:03
He can stay exactly where he is thanks
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:11:43
Then there is your answer... don't be greedy
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:42:38
Ahhhh a fellow Adelaidian!
Was gonna bring my GTR down to the meet too but with the weather lately I stayed home instead haha
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:39:23
This is why they should have a separated address convention...
And why you should ALWAYS triple check where you're sending funds to
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:17:11
lol I don't think Satoshi is the Zodiac. Definitely was a cryptography fan though.... and of killing too
@_date: 2019-07-14 04:50:42
Tom of MySpace is living a mighty fine life, check his Insta... basically just travels the world taking pictures of amazing things

Your recovery seed
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:54:46
I saw yesterday on the first page Egon had 8 of the 25 new posts. He just spams the same shit, reposting from twitter every day to make the sub looks busy. It's just a cess pit, stay away to save yourself the stress of dealing with those idiots.
It's sad because there's some technologically smart people on the other side; they're just blinded by bullshit
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:34:18
@_date: 2019-07-22 06:47:01
I think Eth has a lot of problems to overcome going forward but at least it's a legitimate project (unlike BCH)
I wish you luck :)
Oh and remember that isn't the be all and end all of the crypto/BTC space. I wouldn't take too much notice of the memes posted here
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:47:38
He's a self made dickhead too. I don't really like to get in the whole shit slinging thing about Ver but by doing shit like this reflects negatively on both him and BCH
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:27:36
Yes, you're right!
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:38:15
And a fraction of the people were using it as well. If we want to make it mainstream we need to develop solutions to accommodate the masses
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:26:54
No, you can use a hardware wallet on any machine
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:02:46
Congrats! You won't ever find a more loyal and loving friend. I love my two :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:05:13
Just verified an account for my in-laws yesterday using the same method. Worked just fine
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:03:26
Due to a broken difficulty adjustment system blocks were getting mined higher than the average 6 per hour (1 every 10 minutes) this led to the inflation of more than 100k coins on the BCH chain. It's fixed now with the new difficulty adjustment system but that doesn't roll back the coins already mined
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:10:05
Ledger keeps putting out updates for the device, you'll be fine. Your coins will be safe
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:58:21
Any address starting with a 3 will be a SetWit address.... if your address starts with a 1, it's not SegWit
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:53:09
That's awesome man, I wish you all the best in your studies!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:24:45
Same to you mate!
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:04:56
Good stuff! Even the 458 is a weapon. Just so refined yet brutal at the same time.
Took the 488, 650S and Huracan for a spin. The Huracan definitely sounded the best but I LOVED the 488. Surprisingly I enjoyed the Macca the least.
Glad you had a good time :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:49:35
Quite possibly, yes. But once a gambler always a gambler is all I was getting at. He's just switched one vice for another
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:43:18
Hate to break it to you, but he's still gambling... just in a different way
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:02:06
Yeah you did this to yourself mate... I feel for you but you lied and went behind her back. Bitcoin had nothing to do with this, it's just the catalyst that allowed you to destroy your marriage. I hope you can salvage what's left and work through it :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:09:35
Before anything.. you're young and it's only money (I know that's easy to say but it's true) It isn't worth ending your life over
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:54:16
Have fun! Do yourself a favour and try the 488... sublime experience
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:28:08
Exactly, because you know no one is watching...
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:04:39
Fairly sure that's meant to read "There is a reason BANKS exist"
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:38:34
Very little
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:17:14
I'd say it would have been more of a price point type thing that lack of foresight
@_date: 2018-09-14 09:21:37
Suck it Garza, was a long time coming. He got off easy considering how many people got screwed but for every one like him that gets put away there's 100 more out there scot free
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:08:01
No one knows how TCP/IP or any of the other underlying tech that we use as part of the internet. It just works. 
That's how I forsee the future of crypto being... we are just in its infancy and have a lot of growing pains to go through before this tech is ready for the masses
@_date: 2018-08-27 04:22:25
Yeah, I'm heartbroken
@_date: 2018-08-27 08:07:49
How people can't see through his shit is beyond me. Actually, I think it's they don't want to see through his shit because they know they've been fooled by all his crap.
The sooner Ver pisses off and becomes irrelevant the better IMO
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:35:25
What a fucking flog. I'm embarrassed he's Australian. About time he got shown up in public however, absolute lunatic
@_date: 2018-08-13 11:58:50
Yeah I can't feel sorry for anyone suckered into Ver and Wu's bullshit. The writing has been on the wall for long enough. Do your research and find the truth; it's easy to see through their lies
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:00:50
A true fucking hero! On behalf of everyone, thank you :)
@_date: 2014-08-03 12:14:43

The only correct answer
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:01:48
Said the same goodbye myself. Love my Trezor!
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:30:52
Nifty! Any chance of a guide? And I didn't see it running as a node... or was that in the background?
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:08:38
As long as they get their fees through people trading it... they won't
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:04:22
Truth hurts... especially Rogers ego
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:26:27
I'm interested... just picked up a model B+ and will give it a whirl
@_date: 2014-10-17 05:43:12
To be fair, nothing in that email paints you in a bad light and you're being apologetic about an incident you caused. I'd say you've hit all the right marks; albeit after you had all this negative attention thrust onto you.
Calling him an idiot now brings into question the sincerity of that email bud, just FYI ;)
@_date: 2014-08-03 04:14:46
Great news! Just ordered and can't wait to use it!
Thanks for all your hard work fellas!!!
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:46:13
Just the Bitcoin one please bud :)
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:51:21
Beautiful story mate and why I'm a firm believer in karma... just sad he had to pay such a high price before he woke up to the fact as well
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:31:12
No dramas bud :)
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:09:22
Yep, my parents and my other halfs parents also
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:25:32
Great thing you're doing... I love this community :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:45:48
Great guy, love it!
@_date: 2014-12-23 12:47:10
Got my BTC! Did what you suggested and made a video. Don't think I'll be using this service again
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:09:49
My max withdraw is 0.001 BTC :(
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:27:09
Not what I wanted to hear, just signed up and deposited $250 the other day and currently going through verification... hopefully all goes well for me
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:38:42
Well that's a fucking bitch ain't it!
I'm in SA which helps to some degree but they sure as fuck won't be getting my front/back of my credit/debit card
@_date: 2015-05-28 07:29:41
Thanks bud! I'm already running a node on it however, just looking for something like the equivalent software that will display stats on the screen like this one. The backend interface looks cool as well but I could live without that.
In short, I wish I was more adept at these things so I could sort it myself haha
@_date: 2014-10-22 04:38:59
Cheers bud!
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:20:46
Yep, they've fucked me the same way. What's been your resolution to this?
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:28:21
Not anymore ;)
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:24:36
Used igot once, never again. I got my BTC but after jumping through an assload of hoops. I wasn't in for big bucks like you either...
Hope you get what's yours mate
@_date: 2014-11-08 00:25:07
Common theme bud...
I hope them and the fuckwits at MinerSource burn in hell. Two shitful, useless companies that are a blight on the BTC world
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:13:54
Why did he stop?
@_date: 2017-02-19 02:39:37
See above :)
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:31:54
That's amazing! I love it! If only I hadn't bought an RPi2 recently I'd be all over this!
Anyone crafty enough to have this software written for an RPi (the stats display on the screen) I'm too much of a noob for such things :p
@_date: 2014-12-13 04:31:28
How does one do this (sorry, noob here)
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:50:23
That's really bad man, I feel for you but please... nothing is worth your life. If you have thoughts like that, talk to someone. Hell, even if you just need someone to listen to, chuck me a PM :)
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:58:17
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:50:40
Hmm..... checking in
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:15:42
Fuck I love Karl! Hamish and Andy, not so much
@_date: 2019-11-30 03:45:30
Looks like an interesting app, I'll take a look
@_date: 2019-03-25 07:11:46
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:43:28
You're still a great spokesperson for bitcoin and we are lucky to have you.
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:10:52
Yeah the power usage will be a great deal higher with the antminers; don't discount having to pay that bill
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:28:48
I just did my basic verification then, now I have a 3BTC daily withdrawal limit. Not sure what's going on your end but as soon as I verified my phone number it was instantaneous
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:18:49
Not at all, never too late!
@_date: 2018-10-09 03:58:04
Where you located mate? I can help you out with some if you'd like, just shoot me a PM
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:17:06
It's a throwaway
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:57:11
Yeah did the same last week. Literally a non issue and took like a few minutes max. I suggest doing this and you'll be fine :)
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:53:07
And then I'll know it isn't 100% backed
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:15:24
Him and his buddy Jihan won't be happy. That being said Bitmain won't sit idly and wait
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:31:32
This is fucked, living in Australia I'd HOPED we would never see this but always thought there'd be players pushing for this to happen... sad state of affairs
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:56:57
They are an echo chamber of crazy and conspiracy. Don't expect much to change until Roger gets either A) bored or B) runs out of money
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:32:37
Nah bro
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:34:22
Such a good show!
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:49:42
Another fraud...
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:33:47
No bashing BTC here mate
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:53:14
Another fraud
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:25:03
Not really the right message to send with defacing public property and all but appreciate the message
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:21:17
Go to a bank and ask them for money. Don't use someone else's hard earned
@_date: 2019-08-11 09:22:45
He's off his rocker
I definitely think he's had some sort of break... sad really, I think at his core Roger is actually a decent dude
@_date: 2019-10-13 08:47:11
You gambled with your cousins money... Can't feel sorry for ya
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:06:56
From what I've seen/read the early batches of the X still have some teething issues in manufacturing. I definitely will buy one at some point but I'll wait a few months before ordering I think
@_date: 2019-08-09 07:30:43
Yeah... that's not how any of this works
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:42:14
To get away from fiat
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:34:25
Isn't that why BTC was created?
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:11:12
All that sub does is bash Bitcoin instead of focusing on their own coin. What a cesspit
@_date: 2019-08-27 09:44:41
If he had access to these coins he wouldn't have a problem proving he is Satoshi
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:15:03
I never get downvoted so hard and so fast as when I post over there... It's crazy
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:33:48
That's actually closer to a Ferrari than a Lambo
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:04:17
EDIT: Got beaten to it
@_date: 2019-10-17 08:24:09
Just because a coin is private and CAN be used for nefarious purposes (such as child porn) that doesn't take away from the use case of the coin itself. People will always be shit and twist technology for their own shitty means. Does that mean you should have to give up your right to privacy?
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:50:45
Not talking down to you mate but if you're this worried then you either over committed or haven't researched enough into what Bitcoin is. I suggest reading as much as you can about BTC before you decide putting more money in.
Best of luck to you :)
@_date: 2019-08-27 05:55:42
He needs to have it to give it
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:26:16
Either choice is fine to be honest; I own both.
That being said, I prefer the Trezor
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:56:00
You can't go wrong with either really... I own both including the Ledger Blue but I prefer the Trezor myself.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:41:34
And Satoshi leaving after Gavin spoke to the CIA tells me old mate Wright DEFINITELY isn't Satoshi
@_date: 2019-02-06 04:32:22
lol exactly, what a farce
@_date: 2019-02-06 07:20:04
Not sure why Roger didn't just post that under his personal account... what a dickbag
@_date: 2019-06-13 01:37:03
Don't forget to factor in rising difficulty
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:04:31
Sad, but saw this coming with all the dramas they've had of late. I had issues with them late last year and vowed never to use them again.
Feel sorry for those out there that got conned by these guys
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:29:09
Thank you for taking the time to respond! Some great answers there and some insight into what I myself thought was going on at the time.
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:24:42
I used BTCMarkets recently, very good service IMO. Definitely would use again!
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:45:16
OP listen to this guy. Trustworthy and has recovered passwords for many peoples wallets before. If you have any clue what the password might be, give Dave a try
@_date: 2019-02-05 12:16:36
This dickhead... What a moron, even worse people fall for his shit all over again with his ego coin, BCH
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:56:55
Poor little fella, hope he makes a full recovery!
@_date: 2019-02-27 06:12:43
That sucks man but please don't tell me you were holding on the exchange?
@_date: 2015-08-14 02:54:12
Perhaps it might be better waiting then?
I've already got the SD card (64GB) running a node so ideally to just be able to download the software and compile would be the best but I'm not sure how you want to do things either :)
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:04:02
Well they're trying to steal the bitcoin name so what's gonna make them stop trying with anything else
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:37:56
How goes the progress mate? My PiTFT arrived and I'd love to give it a whirl
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:07:16
That sub is a fucking mess... Hayden is a dead set dropkick manipulating all sorts of data sets to cherry pick a narrative that just isn't there. Then they rally behind a bunch of lies, call people "core cucks" and rave on about cognitive dissonance to make them sound smart.
It's good entertainment though
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:04:53
The tilt of the B in the logo I'm assuming
@_date: 2019-12-22 21:17:54
Hayden Otto lol... I wouldn't worry too much about people taking him seriously
@_date: 2019-12-22 22:20:24
Probably opened 2500 times himself
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:07:48
Do you think someone made it away with a lot of BTC/money and is now sitting very pretty?
I have always thought Mark was always just in over his head and didn't quite understand what was going on around him (both in terms of the money involved and the systems in place) Does this sound about right?
After all of this do you still believe in bitcoin or was the massive bull run all Mark's doing one way or the other?
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:17:45
Raspbian is the distro I use... no issues here and runs well. Never really had a reason to change I guess
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:33:19
Awesome, look forward to my drive tomorrow to listen to this. Thanks for all your hard work this year Pete!
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:59:15
Definitely would be keen in such a setup. Running a node on my Pi2 but would love to have a display showing stats too
@_date: 2015-08-06 04:02:04
Awesome stuff mate, watching this with interest!
FYI: Just ordered a PiTFT ;)
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:18:54
Like I said, it's all cherry picked. They're either totally delusional or outright liars. I'm not sure which and I really don't care; I just feel for the people who buy into their shit as well
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:23:21
Follow this guide
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:58:28
RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2019-04-01 08:44:00
No he's a joke all year round
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:21:18
Seems cheeky but very clever!
@_date: 2015-07-12 08:05:47
Yep, the scene in the bar with the Appletini cemented that theory for me
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:47:00
And yes, the LCD is also compatible so there's no issues there either ;)
As for the stats displayed, basically I think everything you listed there (which is also on the Bitnodes hardware) and maybe the local IP as well?
@_date: 2015-08-30 00:39:06
@_date: 2019-04-16 06:05:06
ROFL that's great!
@_date: 2019-06-17 07:25:42
Don't worry Roger will find a way to spin this to try and make it sound good and the bag holders and people he's previously duped will eat it up
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:56:52
Same image should be fine. I took out my SD card from my model B, chucked it into my Pi2 and it worked a treat :)
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:30:35
Use it
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:58:17
Can you explain to a layman just exactly what they're doing with veriblock and why?
@_date: 2018-11-12 08:22:18
Draper doesn't
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:38:41
This is quite true, didn't even think of that. Only way then is his seed was compromised or someone had physical control of his Trezor
Orrrrrrr..... it's bullshit (not calling you a liar OP)
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:09:25
Not calling him stupid but something has been overlooked here. Either he left the Trezor logged in and someone remote accessed into his machine and moved the coins or someone close to him has moved the coins for themselves. Either way I'm 100% sure the Trezor is not the weak link here
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:44:51
He's an idiot but he's not stupid. Trust me, sadly he still has a lot of his BTC holdings
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:01:54
What, just like the mining for BCH?
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:12:15
Hah, I feel ya brother
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:38:45
That isn't the answer to this whole problem
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:10:10
Man I have the Blue too but for such a cool little device support is such a shit show. The Nano S has way more support sadly. I've got this, the Nano S and a Trezor, out of them all I prefer the Trezor the best but good on you for using a hardware wallet to keep funds safe. Never trust your keys with someone else!
@_date: 2019-01-03 10:35:24
That's hilarious, thanks
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:20:52
That's why best practice is to sync it on a PC then copy it over to the storage you're using on the Pi

Nope, just adjusting and making way for the next wave. As long as there's money to be made, someone will always be mining
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:32:50
Sorry mate, I only sought it out because I had to do the same when paying for my PIA subscription; had it bookmarked since then.
Doesn't help you now but maybe in the future or maybe someone else :)
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:59:07
Not on the BTC chain, still works on BCH however
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:29:54
Ver... what a flog
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:36:36
Probably none at all. He's not actually as smart as he thinks he is; he's just been lucky and has had money to burn along the way. Jihan is the real businessman
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:14:46
I know it doesn't help you now but next time use this so you can extract the address from the bitpay link and pay manually using your Trezor
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:24:33
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:57:11
First, why is the Ledger safer than Trezor? Also, Trezor supports more than just Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:26:15
I just want to sign up for a massage
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:21:34
Yeah I'm not seeing how they managed to breach your Trezor. Something happened here that you've left out
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:06:25
No, you're totally right, it's impossible. You physically need to confirm the transactions on the Trezor regardless
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:18:28
Don't be a fuckin' dick man. He can spend his money however he likes.
When I went to Vegas last year I hired a 488, Huracan and 650S to drive around the track because I love cars, do I need to grow up too?

It's sad that I saw many people selling their entire BTC stash to double down on their BCH. I mean, sure, hedge your bets and keep your BCH stash from the split if you're worried with will actually replace BTC, but selling it all.... crazy.
A lot of poor uninformed people have been taken advantage of by the likes of Roger
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:24:47
That's a different project though man....
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:40:28
The hardware wallet is never hacked, it's always poor opsec by the user
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:50:40
Haha good to know
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:16:10
Binance is actually one of the "good" exchanges in my mind. They always seem proactive about security and their CEO seems like a decent dude. I'd still never keep amounts on there I'm not willing to lose because I'm not an idiot but as far as exchanges go it seems relatively "safe"
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:00:24
Or that too...
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:52:40
@_date: 2018-04-10 06:16:43
You're right, just saw it was an AusCoin machine... No interest now
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:33:45
Just so you know, you're an idiot
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:03:44
Thanks for your reply Mark. I hope in the future you can fully put this behind you and both you and the community as a whole can move on from the Mt Gox debacle
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:16:48
First, thanks for doing this, you'll undoubtedly cop a lot of (possibly deserved) anger towards you.
My question, do you still believe in Bitcoin? Where do you see it headed in say the next 5 years and in your wildest dreams when you got into Mt Gox did you ever see it going this way (both in BTC adoption and what happened to Mt Gox as a whole)
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:42:01
I'm sure this is a troll but in case it isn't
1) Never borrow money to invest in something as speculative as crypto
2) Never invest more than you're willing to lose forever
3) Don't trade emotionally and chase losses, you'll end up digging a deeper hole for yourself
4) $10k is nothing, it's not life changing and you can recover. Leave your coins now, don't sell, don't trade, just let them sit. If they go up, awesome... if not, you've learnt a lesson. With all the extra time you've got not worrying or trading, get a second job or put in more hours at your current one and make the money back
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:06:09
Because with what he has now he has more than enough
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:55:22
Funny, I read that quote and thought it sounded familiar. It was a direct reply to one of my questions in the AMA.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:02:24
Nope, Australian Financial Review
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:55:42
Hell yeah! Gonna have to go down one day and use it!

Did I turn my stove off before I left the house this morning?
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:50:05
Feel for you mate, it's a lot of money to be out of pocket for. Definitely seems too many excuses are being given for it to be legitimate.
I've used them once and never again... the hoops they made me jump through just to get my coins withdrawn was crazy
@_date: 2015-03-27 11:59:15
Unfortunately this is probably the case :(
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:02:48
Not for long
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:06:33
Didn't see that coming!

With the seed you don't need the wallet.dat file
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:31:32
Read this...
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:01:45
Yeah, fuck BlackArrow. Hopefully they never are able to rip off anyone else ever again
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:00:21
Oh really, why is that?
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:50:48
It was the initial launching of the website that contained his hotmail address... he subsequently removed it afterward but apparently it was too late. I'm not sure if I believe it or not but it's definitely crazy bad OPSEC if true
@_date: 2015-02-07 04:07:28
Agreed. I've seen some people complain about the cost of the Trezor but honestly if you can't fork out the (to me trivial) cost of a Trezor then you lose all rights to complain if you lose your coins. Fair enough the cost to build the hardware is cheap but it's the R&amp;D, ongoing development and support that you're paying for.
Top notch product!
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:14:37
Look up Quadriga
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:54:11
I'm pretty sure he means Electrum
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:16:57
lol an SV6... big spender

PIA is what I use, can pay via crypto
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:33:26
Well looks like I'll have to get off my ass and try to run an LN node... something I've been wanting to do for a while now
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:31:28
Mixed coins can still be traced, it's just a lot harder
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:29:40
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:53:14
People think Bitfinex is insolvent so they're paying a premium to buy BTC on that exchange to send it off of there before everything goes belly up. If that happens or not is up to debate
@_date: 2016-07-10 11:57:19
@_date: 2019-05-04 03:26:40
That's if you trust they'll send the USDT and not go tits up in the mean time
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:16:45
It's a node, he's not mining with it
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:05:42
This I did not know... Got some links I can read up on?
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:33:14
Once you buy, just buy more BTC, that way you're using it as a currency but topping it up as you go along
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:29:16
Thanks mate, Merry Christmas!
