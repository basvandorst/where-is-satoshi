Bad comparison. Litecoin has not yet faced the scaleability challenges bitcoin has. Like all altcoins










Sure. But that is known not to scale. Just like TCP needs IP to scale but comes with some complexity.










Not so much. Though It is likely hubs will form regionally in towns/cities as people tend to pay a lot locally. But not comparable with gmail. More comparable with mailservers around the world.

Not smaller, only different. Where I live there's the twin peaks regulatory system, as many coutries have. Part of this model is quite useable with crypto. Other parts, like central banking, is no longer needed.

@_date: 2014-07-04 12:13:59
This is great news.  
The EBA recommends European banks and financial institutions to have Bitcoin exchanges to follow financial requirements like KYC and AML to have Bitcoin innovation succeed outside of the current financial sector.
This is perfect. Many exchanges already have sound information on their customers and are happy to inform regulators about big transactions or other suspicious actions of their customers (for example to prevent terrorism).
This makes Bitcoin just a little more acceptable for mainstream businesses and people.

I just returned from a trip to china last week. I was travelling from Chengdu to HongKong for 2 weeks. Nothing Bitcoin related caught my eye during this vacation.
I'm wondering if the rumors are true that Chinese government/businesses are busy buying as much cryto as possible. Somewhat the same way they do with gold for example. Bigger conspiracies suggest the changing positions on regulation was a orchestrated job to push down prices and buy BTC cheap.

A mixer puts MK´s deposit in the same address with deposits of many others. then this big address get split up and delivered in small parts at various new adresses. the new addresses are emailed to MK. Now it is unknown who owns what coins.
the reason MK splits the 200k is that mixers only work if your deposit is about the same size of the other deposits

as a matter of fact this solution is meant to save a lot of trouble. By accepting BTC as a business there's no need (in many countries) to formally startup a business the traditional way as there's no money involved. 
This way a DAO can be run and serve to customers that still use USD.
If I am a merchant and choose to deliver before the payment can be reversed that is my own choice.

In the nineties many people were unable to grasp the usecase of a computer at home or in their small business that is connected to the internet. 
They argued "How can this computer with internet work better than a fax machine?". All possibilities that a connected computer has were being neglected. The main reason was not a negative positioon on the internet but the inability to imagine the real possibilities or believe 'the hype'.
This is what, i think, we see with Bitcoin today.

Central banks will probably push (slowly but surely) for a ban on Bitcoin. This is common sense from a risk perspective on their behalf. This is how i think it will unfold more or less: 
After demonizing Bitcoin for a while states/countries will adopt the current Chinese model. You can by then still do everything with BTC like buying stuff and trading. Bitcoin is only not a valid currency and banks cannot offer BTC related services. 
The next move will probably be the state forcing regular banks to disallow payment from/to BTC exchanges. By that time trading peer to peer is the way to go for us as BTC is not illegal, for example with reputation-based-websites like bitcoin.de or localbitcoins. 
After that BTC related companies will be cut off and shops for example experience difficulties changing to fiat. Some will turn away from Bitcoin and less will begin accepting it. 
This will continue until Bitcoin use starts to grow again, despite all difficulties. Then Bitcoin (trading) might become illegal altogether, but this will take a lot more time to become part of the law. By that time we shift to Tor to continue. If mainstream uers follow us along is questionable. 
By the time smart contracts and smart agents become useable and desired, Bitcoin (or one of its then popular successors) will recover and governments will (have to) turn around and accept innovation. 
I sure hope the financial system collapses soon enough and this scenario gets a shortcut somewhere near the beginning...

I was wondering why they support Ethereum with that much money also. The IPO is bove 12 million USD at the moment so i believe.
I wonder especially because:
* There's inflation built into Ethereum if i'm right
* Bitcoin has a much bigger market cap
* The network effect on Bitcoin is just way ahead
* We have Codius now: 
Are all these millions invested to actually use in ether code execution? If people buy for speculative reasons. What about these points?
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:28:22
One large regional bank that got busted in the scandal had to pay a relatively small fine when it got caught red handed making millions each day with manipulating the interest rates. The price to be paid for these millions ended up at the consumers of course. That same year bonuses were given to the higher management. No one went to jail. The fine was even deducted from taxes for crying out loud. So in the end consumers ended up paying the greater part of the fine via taxes and higher prices on banking products.
How is that happening with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:16:09

I'm in kenya at the moment. People here think money transfers are expensive. 'The competition' (mpesa) charges 3.33%, depending on the amount.  Orange, Kash and viatel have similar, sometimes competitive, rates but mpesa is the most widely used. I think widespread adoption of bitcoin has a long way to go here as people who think mpesa is expensive, the poorer people, often don't have properly working Internet access. And definitely not mobile. A local sms carrier for bitcoin is needed here.

I was there when it launched. IT was more busy than expected. There were dozens of people at the very start attending presentations and speeches. Towards the evening parts of the 'boulevard' were very crowded with people standing in the streets. The ATM brought by the suisse was working overtime and the restaurant was very crowded during the evening. There were dutch journalists and it got a lot of attention on the radio and in papers an on the internet. There even was a journalist of the french paper Le Monde!
There were also some startup problems. One cafe got off the boat in advance of the day because 'it was not convenient enough'. One had no idea how it worked and one was not instructed how to be sure that the money had arrived and stopped accepting during the first night. There were some technical problems etc. But in the end it was very succesful and a fun night. 
The first day maybe just over 1 BTC of sales were made and at the moment it is 2.9 BTC in total for the ten locations (assuming they still use the same addresses as intended). Almost half of all the BTC's are spend in the restaurant that has the ATM. I'm not sure if the ATM is still there and if all shops accept BTC at the moment. 
Nice fact: Meanwhile two other locations in The Hague now also accept BTC :-) The boulevard will run two months before being evaluated (was the initial plan AFAIK). After that maybe it'll stick at some places.

I agree so much. 
To go one step further: in the future this might lead to a cyclic economy where recycling becomes upcycling,  making resources actually better. Products may be durable for decades so it gets useful to lease its use in stead of owning the products. Cradle 2 cradle explains this. In this idea people no longer buy chairs for example.  They lease hours to be able to sit.

Adoption in this context will take some time I presume. I think bitcoin/bitpesa will succeed in the end though, as it is a better technology.

maybe he had this job outsourced, but probably not. Maybe the splitting up is a service of the mixer. i don´t know if this exists but the splitup follows a tree pattern and not a split in many parts at once. this could mean it is done by (mixer) software. I hope, if this should be the case, he did not wrote this code himself! :-)

As far as i'm concerned Bitcoin is already a success.

A common motivation among all these people is to have the word out about Bitcoin.
Organize a collaborative effort to write a complete and understandable explanation about Bitcoin, starting with the most thorough translation on WikiPedia. Make it complete and explain everything relevant to know for newbies: what it is, how it works, where it is from, it's impact, it's past, it's possible future scenario's, the blockchain, altcoins, common misconceptions etc etc. Have the (major) results and changes discussed worldwide during the weekly meetups and use the results. After that maybe follow up with some in depth explanations. for example how to make a smart contract, how to use sidechains, colored coins etc.
Make this (or these) wikipedia page(s) the worldwide norm or "standard" for every country and/or language. Next translate this to as much languages possible with all participants and promote it's use locally. This is helpful for journalists, politicians, scientistst, students etc etc. It is also possible to do this on bitcoin.org if they would like to collaborate.
Make it all work introducing some rules. for example: "No content is added until all or at least 90% of the languages has the same level of completeness". This incentifies collaboration. Maybe add some more rules or form of competition.
This requires a worldwide group effort using the combined knowledge, experience, skills and motivation of the entire community. Start small (for example only the "What is Bitcoin?" part) and elaboratoe on that basic content. Keep on adding text, images and pages until everything, up to every minor detail, is explained and related to scientific papers, books etc etc. In all relevant languages!
With the result everybody on earth (with access to wikipedia) can have equal access to these great borderless innovations called Bitcoin and blockchain.

The ethers are not meant to be used as coins. Ethers are used for running the code of the smart contract. Ethers have value for that matter but they are not designed as currency, to be hoarded etc. Ethers will be used to run code, thats their main purpose. Eacht code cycle costs an ether or something.
And exactly this is unlike other altcoins. Time will tell what will happen ultimately ofcourse, as this is also a first timer, but it is probable that the inflation of ethers will not turn it into a Bitcoin competitor.

Interesting. So everything is fine then.

If miners collide to use this as a group that is just big enough so they can push miners out that do not want to use it, have no access to asicboost or are denied to join the group. This results in more centralised mining / security risks.

I can recommend it. This setup has no noise whatsoever and seems rather low on energy consumption. I still need to see if the system doesn't overheat when playing games on some of the (not so well written) emulators. But it is easy to turn on/off bitcoind temporarily or buy a fan.

repost: I'm still holding and keep it that way. Why? Because I support the entire ecosystem and therefore essentially support this new form of governance, not centralised governance. Hard forks and alt-coins are decentralised governance in action. I want to see where it goes and have actual skin in the (entire) game. It is still possible determined whales push the price of BCH/BCC back up once volume is low(er). If not, i don't mind either.

Seen from a broader perspective: Why do you think miners, with this responsibility in their hands, will mess the system up in its entirety that everything goes to shit? They will probably never do that. IMHO. 
Ofcourse I agree that central power at the miners is a shitty thing, but they have a clear incentive to keep _a_ network up and running AND keep users happy. If they do not manage to do so people will flock to other coins. In this broad perspective, doesn't the game theory still work?

I'm not sure this person knows how Banks make money. The way Banks earn their millions is by creating money, like the Central Banks. 
Regular banks can create money to use for loans. Usually for mortgage. (source:  The biggest profit from regular banks is from interest on this (temporarily) created money. The created money won't stay within the system (unlike money created by central banks).
With Bitcoin Banks cannot create money anymore. Why would Banks help Bitcoin grow and increase the risk people switch to Bitcoin while banks earn most of their money from fiat?

You could be very right. Today in europe many banks experienced severe ddos attacks. This resulted in hundreds of thousands of people not being able to buy goods in webshops with euro's.

what software will you use to integrate Bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:16:32
Sure. Why not. Did you ever see what's happening in the server room of your bank?
I'm delighted i can track this communication or even help out myself.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:54:00
I agree.
I've stripped the way businesses can adopt Bitcoin payments easily to it's bare minimum. Maybe this way businesses can move more easy to accepting bitcoins if we promote it this way:
**My suggestion to tell shopkeepers and small businesses how to accept BTC within minutes:**
Within a few minutes you can offer your services or products to the growing number of Bitcoin users. For this simple way to accept Bitcoin payments all you need is a email-address and a Bitcoin wallet.
*how does it work?*
* With many Bitcoin wallets you can create a unique Bitcoin receiving-address for each payment. When you interact with a customer, you can create a unique receive-address and give it a name. For example, the order number. This way you can easily manage your payments with your wallet.
* You mail this Bitcoin receiving-address to your customer so he or she can make the payment.
* Within seconds you will see the payment in your wallet and after a few minutes the payment is irreversible. You can start immediately with the delivery.
*what you need to do*
With a wallet, all you need to do to accept Bitcoin payments with your business is modify your communications and advertise that you can receive Bitcoin payments. You can do this on your website with a [logo]( and an explanation, on your [printed media]( or on your [building](
If you want to receive Bitcoins in a shop, bar or on the streets you can use a smartphone or tablet and easily start accepting Bitcoins. Just install a wallet app on your device to be able to offer your clients a receive address in the form of a QR code on your device. Customers can use their mobile wallet to make a payment by scanning the QR-code.
*When your Bitcoin strategy is succesful*
When you start receiving Bitcoins in this simple way, the adoption process for your organization is quick and easy. Also, your customers can get used to the idea of paying with digital money. This personal approach works well because Bitcoin is quite new and users sometimes are a bit uncertain about how to use it.
When the performance of this pragmatic solution to accept Bitcoins for your business begins to take takes too much time or if you need more features with your payment process, your [Bitcoin strategy]( has proven to be successful! If you need to process many Bitcoin payments in your shop or on your website or if you need your staff to accept payments more easy and secure there are several possibilities. The best known is BitPay and offers [appropriate solutions]( for all kinds of businesses.

My thoughts were that if the big mining pools used different software the chances that the entire network has a problem at the same time might just be smaller.
Then only one (small) part of the network using that software would have a problem and the blockchain from the majority of the nodes would always be larger.
It is the consensus that annoys me. The system should be robust enough to go on without it. If a few mining pools decided otherwise and agreed keeping the forked blockchain up there's nothing we could do about it and only hope they won't try to double-spend or use other tricks for personal gains.

sure :-) wait i have it somewhere...
you don't think it was a ddos?

Thanks for mentioning. I almost forgot
@_date: 2013-04-06 10:32:42
:-) thank you!
I agree. It shows how bad i am with this. I'm just curious how the community thinks about the idea.
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:03:39
I discuss this a lot with my friend. The way i hear about it from him (he works for ING Investment management) is that a small part of the employee there know very well what's wrong. He told me most of these people working there only work there for the money but have completely other plans for the future.
Of course higher management is also well aware. These people are actually quite smart. It is surprising a senior analyst actually speaks out about it to a group of employees.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:33:06
why is everybody so relaxed? not enough volume causing this? But then where are the buyers??
@_date: 2013-12-20 06:41:23
This guy.... he is great. Atm he's writing a book about bitcoin for o' reilly. That's probably going to be a book everyone here should have.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:09:21
you need to update because the old versions will become useless after may 15. Google for Bitcoin Fork to read up why.
You should backup your wallet.dat or temporarily send all your BTC to another wallet. This may just be a good moment to create a paper wallet and transfer your funds there.
I've updated from .8.0 to .8.1 without problems. My coins (wallet.dat) were still there. I'm not sure if this is also allright from .6.3. It probably will go just fine, especially if you have your backup.
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:07:40
As mentioned before i think websites need to show up explainig what Bitcoin is, how it works, why it's secure, what the pro's and con's are, how to set up wallets, how to buy coins and what the fuss is all about.
Explanations should be very conceptual and have many everyday-life comparisons. For example the words hash, miner, private key etc are useless for the common reader. So explanations should contain comparisons: your private key is only mentioned as 'a long difficult password' and a hash could be shown as an example. A public-address is mentioned as a 'receive-address' and compared to a bankaccount number and the blockchain is a continuous stream of solutions to difficult riddles wich are hard to crack but easy to check by other computers in the network. Stuff like encryption and brute force is explained as 'difficult puzzles' so 'proof of work' can be left out. 
Every sentence should be actively written and easy to grasp for, say,  an old lady. Walkthroughs need to contain explanatory screenshots or even better, animations.

What would be interesting is the possibility of transactions in the same way i use my creditcard at a self-service gas station: 
I slide/scan some kind of BTC account, get gas and leave. After this the right amount of BTC are paid from my account (automatic).

nice to hear from you. My dream is also way more longer...Do'nt be jealous. Just be sure you have a place to go to for some weeks near Amsterdam in the Netherlands. PM me for that :-)

As Satoshi dissappeared i assume these two will never ride the same elevator or fly in the same airplane? :-)

What does the green line on  express. how should i interpret it?

Great post.
Also really great to hear you run on solar power. We need that. In Europe the major news rants about the amount of electricity(=oil) needed to keep Bitcoin alive. Keeping Bitcoin up and running costs a lot of good old 'watts' and over here most people are aware about where power actually comes from......
I don't mine because electricity over here is way too expesive, so have fun with it and please, keep it CO2 neutral :-)

I just did: after being untouched for 140 years.
I think with this disclaimer everybody understands that inherited coins need to be transferred to survive the new owners grandchildren.
I think the pros i mentioned outweigh the cons.

look at it as the internet in 1995. With your BBS equipment you considered it something cool but no way near as important as fido-net. Later all you've become to use is netscape.
Compare Bitcoin to your Netscape of the nineties. A window of opportunities you want to know about as soon as possible.
You mentioned you're tech savvy. Bitcoin is your chance to stay savvy. This time it is tech savvy combined with economy savvy. You almost KNOW Bitcoin is important for our future but you're not sure why. Take some time to get to know it. The answers to your questions 1 - 4 follow naturally. 
After that see  a multiple of times.
@_date: 2013-03-18 00:52:33
reconsider your judgement (not replying to your edit)
@_date: 2013-04-26 09:26:54
A Big benefit of Bitcoin is the possibility to transfer money easily abroad at low costs. If your (international) clients want to transfer money around the world, your company can offer a safe place where they can learn how to do it with BTC.
With Bitcoin your clients can serve countries worldwide, beyond the countries that allow creditcard/paypal possibilities.
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:07:46
No. 42 is.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:36:39
Say you have 21 BTC.
With a maximum of 21 mln BTC there can only be 1 mln people with more BTC than you.
At 7,000,000,000 people on earth this leads to the fact that you have more BTC than 99,999% of all humans: 1 - (1,000,000/7,000,000,000)
So i think 21 BTC gets you filthy rich if Bitcoin catches on.

I already like this BBS :-)

I think if you want Bitcoin to succeed you should be a bit more open to people who hear about it later than you did.
@_date: 2013-03-18 00:05:39
okay. fair enough.
I did not spoke the man myself. My friend did. This is actually all they spoke about on the Bitcoin topic as far as i know. The economic details of the presentation were quite specific and beyond my grasp so i left them out as they are not that relevant. It was a three day training for employees of the firm and after i brainwashed my friend about Bitcoin earlier this happened.
Sorry for the grammar. English is not my first language and i use it only on holidays and only speak it with a few friends. I don't write it often enough as you can see.
I did not meant to be obscene. Nor do i represent ING. My friend works there and after i spoke with him about Bitcoin he raised this question. I do not in any way suppose a conspiracy. All i know it ended the conversation about Bitcoin more or less. I just wrote down what i heard and i believe my friend he actually said it. 
The word Biodiversity is mine. (spot on!). He used the word nature. Sorry, my bad. My personal interests made me fill this one in as i think with the word nature he actually meant Biodiversity.
Sorry i have no more details right now. I just know by this the guys working for investment know exactly what the're doing and follow Bitcoin closely. As he mentioned banks won't allow Bitcoin to go mainstream he probably knows (from past incidents maybe) they have power to kill stuff going on. As he doesn't work for a bank but for investment management he probably couldn't elaborate even if he wanted to.
Feel free to believe what you want and sorry for this carelessly written topic.

So what you are saying is that when people get out it's over. Same thing with everything else, gold for example. Prices go down when people get out. Bots are just a method people use to be in, so it's people influencing the stability, bots have nothing to do with it in a broader perspective.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:01:30
I'm into Bitcoin because it's the first possibility for an alternative for fiat money, or at least an alternative that competes with the current financial systems.
With this alternative governments and banks have been given an incentive to do better. And that is the thing is support using Bitcoin. I support this decentralised technology to help give currencies back to those who should own them: the people.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:58:37
sure thing.
anyhow. is there a website that tracks past orders you knof of?

5 days ago i started redditing after some lurking here and my gained interest in Bitcoin.
I don't have any agenda and if i had one it would be the one promoting Bitcoin as i really believe (and hope) it is here to stay. I wrote a merchant to accept Bitcoin for websites ( and i am working on a website promoting it in my country.
You can safely remove the tinfoil :-)
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:04:27
Bitcoin is quite priceless. Not because people use it to speculate or save some money in it for later use. But because it's programmable money.
Please google that for a while. 
Or have a link

another addition: many european banks received major ddos attacks this week. without gains for the attackers. except the fact that online sales were made impossible for half a day. 
Are these the same botnet masters?
