Are you going to force me at gunpoint to answer that question?

It will. And will literally pay people to do it.

I know we're in a bitcoin-related subreddit and all..
But who **the fuck** thinks it's a good idea to hold almost $100,000 worth of an experimental currency.

So would you say the second kind of person is a... problem?

If the network effect is so important, I guess I'd better invest in USD and Visa.

The stripe contains a special CVV indicating a physical swipe transaction. This isn't transmitted wirelessly.

And I can withdraw cash from the bank. I guess that means the banking system is fine.
@_date: 2015-03-02 01:13:31
Fear mongering. This doesn't actually give you enough info to complete a transaction.
CVV and zip code is not included. No one will let you make a transaction without that info.
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:08:39
You refund them with Bitcoin of course.
And then you can't get it back.
@_date: 2015-03-02 02:40:39
Companies can choose to accept additional liability for fraudulent charges and then they don't need info like the CVV or zip code.
I doubt pizza places see a ton of fraud plus they have your physical address, so maybe they did this. Very few places chose to accept this additional liability though.

Yet likes to compare bitcoin to the U.S. Dollar with bitcoin's current artificially low fees (funded by inflation).

According to eBay's records, you never paid. So good luck with that.

Based on the investment advice of this sounds like a great idea.
@_date: 2013-09-23 15:31:56
Should fit right in.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:28:36
If we're going to talk about artificially low fees, then let's talk about he artificially low Bitcoin transaction fee that is being subsidized by inflation (mining reward).
@_date: 2013-10-18 03:23:00
At least since that time all those Bitcoin users used consumer protections to get their money back from BFL.

You'll notice that they continue accepting credit cards. If it's really a loss, then stop accepting them.
But oh wait. They make more money when it's more convenient for people to spend it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:20:52
A lot of sketchy people deal in Bitcoin. These banks probably notice that these accounts are receiving a lot of stolen funds (to be laundered through BTC) and decide to investigate.
Seems pretty obvious.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:08:30
So you want to build up a... blacklist?
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:59:01
You're kind of moving the goalpost here. You can get spendable dollars on the internet with a credit card. And you can do it easily. Bills don't matter.

Do you know them outside the bar? I hate to break it to you, but their entire job is to be everyone's friend. It's not really something that you should be recommending to others even if they were legitimately okay with it. There's a huge power difference in this kind of situation, and a waiter or bar tender doesn't exactly have the power to say no.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:50:58
Reminds me of this one time I talked about roulette next to "smart statistics guy".
He laughed.
I bet it all on 00 and made a billion dollars.
Nothing else gives such delicious smugness.
@_date: 2013-02-27 05:14:46
I would agree that this is a good idea. Let the bitcoin tip be an extra over the standard tip.

Buying anything with a credit card is a loan. It's implied.
@_date: 2013-02-27 05:13:50
Surprise, surprise. I don't think people should be forced into using financial systems.
Isn't that pretty much why were all here? I want people to like Bitcoin, and not associate it with a bad job experience.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:11:21
Or just a bank.
@_date: 2013-08-03 20:07:02
So sweaty.

Uh... You can do this with any credit card.
Put credit card into ATM.
Out comes money.
Go to credit card website.

likes to ignore the losing technologies and the fact that there are far more failures than successes.
After all, if technologies can fail, then that means Bitcoin might fail, and that's scary!
@_date: 2013-01-11 23:14:31
Since you're doing this for academic purposes, be sure to be conscious of the extreme skew in perception you're going to see by asking Bitcoiners questions like this. Anything critical of the system gets shot down pretty quick.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:02:17
And if he doesn't?
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:29:44
No, they were "cool" with it. They had to act "cool" about it, because they don't have any power in that kind of situation. They just have to accept that they aren't getting a tip and move on.
This is a terrible idea since no matter how kind you mean the gesture to be, they don't really have the power to say no without worrying the crazy bitcoin guy is going to complain to their manager.
Edit: I don't particularly think what OP specifically did is bad, and it's not really possible to judge without being there. I just don't think that people should consider this as motivation to start leaving all of their tips in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:05:31
As measured and implemented by humans.

For every example of a controversial technology that ended up succeeding, there are thousands to millions of examples of technologies that failed. It's harder to name those of course.

(Seriously, what does the trading price have to do with the success of Bitcoin? It's not a stock offering where the money is going into a company to be used for something. It's shown us nothing but extreme volatility and could crash tomorrow.)
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:49:53
The 20 year trend is up infinity percent. This must imply that Bitcoin is a safe and mature investment.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:11:36
Bitcoin strongly incentivizes the existence of botnets. If Bitcoin becomes widespread, we will see way more security attacks.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:10:09
You people understand that Bitcoin is literally just an eternal record of every transaction everyone in the world makes, right?
How is that better?

Your startup sounds like a whole lot of bullshit honestly.
