Eh. There are parts of the world that have lived on this sort of system and they don’t innovate anything. Seems sort of counterintuitive to look around at the advanced, technological world and think that the system is bullshit. The system incentivizes the effort required to produce these things. It boggles my mind when people say things like this.

Very few people would go into debt for their actual needs if they focused on saving and not on purchasing things they don’t actually need.

So you’re saying that we simply don’t need people to fulfill the roles that require that amount of education. Brilliant stuff.

Good luck with that. I went through 7 years of college and I can tell you that not a single classmate that I know would’ve endured it for “the joy and meaning” of it. If the money wasn’t there, it would’ve been an empty classroom.

Nice, congrats! My first meal was breast milk. This looks more appetizing

This sounds correct, but who would honestly ever do that? I sure as shit wouldn’t.

Unlike these guys, bitcoin has a bright future, whereas Fayard Nicholas required double hip replacement

You’re 100% right. Banking interests were stacked at the Obama whitehouse. I don’t like Trump, but these douchebags have no clue what they’re talking about. Trump probably would’ve been more of a dick toward the banks, IMO
