You weren't more upset when later they were driving while high on LSD pickled magic mushrooms?

Not sure where this rule comes from, got any proof such a rule exists?


I addressed this in my comment when I said: "You don't seem to like Bitcoin due to your "magic beans" comment so I figured I'd give you a old school cash example." please make sure you fully read my comments.


I made the donation in 2012, prove I didn't.


Prove it.

Which will end up hurting Bitcoin's reputation.

What's up with the Bill Gates fanboy downvote brigade around here? Since when is Gates a fucking hero? I remember a time when Microsoft was always referred to as Micro$oft.
He goes out and starts a charity in his own name and gives himself all his wealth and suddenly he's a father figure?
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:16:02


You tell me, you're the Bill Gates fan boy.


Meh, after nukes the scene is kinda done.


I've given in Bitcoin, so it depends on the exchange rate.


Yeah but why doesn't Gates feed the kids? Why the focus on vaccines? What good is being free from sickness when you die of hunger the next day?

I made the claim that investors get a piece of the action, this is true.
You're the one who's interested about the deal behind the machine so you should look in to it.


$10,000 to the ASPCA.


A 14 year old could win you in a debate on that one:

They gotta sell the poop to water machine to someone. Investors usually get a piece of the action.


Because he didn't want to look like a bad guy.... totally the spirit of philanthropy.


I haven't made a product that kills people. I'm still better than Nobel. Also, they gave his peace prize to Obama who's killed how many people?


What haven't I done?


You get polio by swimming in poo water. I said well fed not poo water drinkers, like Gates.


@_date: 2015-01-29 23:19:11


That poo to water system? Pretty sure he's got a piece of the action.


He did it because people thought poorly of him for killing so many people with TNT. I guess Windows is kind of like TNT, it "blue" up a lot.


If they're well fed they probably wouldn't die.


No, I'm pro human immune system. Don't label me. Your tone is shit and you're obviously drinking the kool-aid by the gallon.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:05:33


Nope, you're looking to prove me wrong, burden of proof is on you.


You don't seem to like Bitcoin due to your "magic beans" comment so I figured I'd give you a old school cash example.
Proof: 


Kevin O'Leary isn't a scientist. People that are advocating for the use of GMOs are mostly lobbyists.

He gave it away to his own charity. Also, he's still giving it away? We should love him for doing a dollar a day?


He can still do that and appear to be doing it for charity:
Gates gets to slap his name on any hospital, school, hall he wants.


How about he just feeds these people? These people don't have immune systems?


Why would I want to compete with him? What good has he done for the world? Windows95?
