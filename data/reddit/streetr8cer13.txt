slipped my mind, I always have that enabled but you're right.

I managed to do it here's a step by step:
1. Use truecrypt and create an encrypted container (I used 200mb, pick a strong password)
2. mount the encrypted conatiner and move wallet.dat to it
3. secure delete original wallet.dat
4. open command prompt as administrator (otherwise you cant write to hidden appdata folder)
5. cd to the appdata folder in the comand prompt (user/*username*/appdata/bitcoin)
6. type "mklink wallet.dat X:\wallet.dat" 
X is the drive letter of the mounted truecrypt container.
it should tell you it successfully created the link if it worked.  unmounting the drive causes the file not to be found, so just mount the volume, launch bitcoin, and boom! wallet.dat is safe. unmount when not in use.
EDIT: Just tried launching BitCoin with the drive unmounted for kicks, it crashes the client hardcore.

what you describe would need bitcoin to have a link protocol which I'm not sure if it has one.

like usernameunavailable said, yes. But as always practice safe browsing habits and you should be okay. Most other methods require you dragging out of the container and swapping back and forth, which would yield the same short amount of vulnerability.  You won't be 100% safe until BitCoin brings out an official solution for encrypted wallets, but these methods definitely help.

I posted this in a different thread, I came up with this myself, as no one posted a guide and this was the type of solution I needed:
1. Use truecrypt and create an encrypted container (I used 200mb, pick a strong password) the wizard in truecrypt should guide you through this
2. mount the encrypted conatiner and move wallet.dat to it (click select file in truecrypt, pick the conatiner you just made, click mount, then type password) it's now mounted as a drive, you'll see it in "my computer"
3. secure delete original wallet.dat
4. open command prompt as administrator (otherwise you cant write to hidden appdata folder)
5. cd to the appdata folder in the comand prompt (user/username/appdata/bitcoin)
6. type "mklink wallet.dat X:\wallet.dat" X is the drive letter of the mounted truecrypt container.
it should tell you it successfully created the link if it worked. unmounting the drive causes the file not to be found, so just mount the volume, launch bitcoin, and boom! wallet.dat is safe. unmount when not in use.
