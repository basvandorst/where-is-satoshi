Is your process open source? Can the source code be peer reviewed? If you take no cut, why do this? Why would someone trust you, especially someone with no account history. Not accusing, just curious.

That's a really cool idea. Similar to "captcha read books". The system gets free labor, working towards a goal, while the user provides the free labor in exchange for a service or goods. Very good idea!

I'm also curious about other Internet  currencies. Anyone know of any other Internet currencies besides litecoin?

Totally cool with me, any money I spend on this would be purely for the entertainment/gambling aspect. It definitely would be a fun learning experience. 
Edit: Bitco, you gave me a cool idea about a website that would have a mock bitcoin market.

Oh cool, thanks for the information!

I'd suggest an alert system that would either send you a text or email.
I googled for a few and found some that already exist. They aren't free, but i'm assuming the "investment" could be worth something if it alerted you early.
Hope it helps someone!

When did this occur?

My counter argument is "How much does it cost to create, circulate, regulate and protect any 'physical' currency?"
I know nothing about this, but my best guess would tell me that it is much, much higher than $147,000 spent every hour.

The reason against paypal, is because the purchaser can claim he/she never received his/her product and get the charge reversed. This is especially common with things like BTC and LTC

I obviously don't know your financial situation, but think about it like this. Tomororow bit coins are worth nothing, how upset/affected are you? Is the risk of more money worth this possible scenario? That's something only you can decide!

I don't think this will have any impact on the price and any coincidence you notice is purely a coincidence.

Use the report features and hopefully the mods will be able to stop this. I'm assuming the more popular this subreddit gets, the more of these we'll see. Report report report!

Imagine the panic and reaction if this happened. It would be tremendous 
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:23:55
I'm not entirely sure either, but it looks impressive nontheless

Drawing a card from a deck is not provably fair in the slightest. I think you need to workout your idea a bit more, before working on getting the word of it out... It will hurt you more then help.

Did they just send them back because they knew they weren't the intended repentant?

I live in New Hampshire, why are you moving here? btw: its awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:51:36
Not as long as I expected, but the terminology is simple like you said. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:54:36
That would work, but I'm thinking about a website that a user could create an account on and have a mock portfolio. I think the biggest difference between our two ideas is that the handwork/research it would take to implement the website would be done once, for everyone to benefit from, rather than each individual user created their own excel workbook.

Glad you liked the recatcha thing. I found it very interesting! I do think that anything I possible as well. If you see anything similar to this feel free to pm me. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:45:46
So all your script does is 
   return addressAssociatedWith1
than you randomly generate a number and we have to believe that you will send the winner(s) the correct amount...? Seems fishy...
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:26:57
I got it, I just didn't think it was funny 
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:08:01
Totally a cool thing. Thanks for sharing! 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:50:40
Well if you, the creator, and I, a random speculator, both think it sounds fishy, then I think you need to go ahead and modify your idea. Somehow incorporate a clear lens, think open source code or something. 
Best of luck to you!
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:28:45
Ight, we be neighbors!

It would be just like any stock market. You could learn the practice of buying and selling, getting a feel for the market in a risk free environment and would definitely be fun.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:51:19
That was my first question. We need to know how the number is being generated
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:20:31
As a potential investor, I hope you're right
