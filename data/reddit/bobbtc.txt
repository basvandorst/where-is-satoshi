Guys Guys Guys wait a second how can Jaron afford to do blow with hookers every night like Joseph David, Mike Curry and the other unsuccessful bitcoin exchange owners do? Please cut this guy a break instead of stealing your money,  selling your shares that don't exists, or selling back door loophole to a well known broadcasting service he has just decided to raise fee's.. Not a little as much as he possible can to rape like they all do.... SO bend over and take like you should !

Cavirtex is just a shitty bank.....
These guys don't even give free pens out either...
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:46:15
19 hours to refill hot wallet ... I don't think soo.. Cavirtex has not proved solvency... They are most likely spending customer bitcoins and customer deposit to pay for operational expenses. Since their volume over the past 4 months has not even made enough revenue to cover salaries they must be spending all of our money... Very very untrusted entity at this point... they may have been the biggest and first Canadian bitcoin exchange, They will be the biggest and first bitcoin company to go under..... Be vary careful.......

Wow Cavirtex learning something new? They are too busy pushing poeple around and trying to control who may enter the market rather than making a better exchange....  
Cavirtex Is now referred to as CaVirpoo
Taking a shit on all its customers...
They are very close to being Mt. CavIRTEX

Why do all Canadian exchanges have the lamest names around?
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:06:18
What do you work for Cavirtex? Only a lame response like that would be from those lame bastards
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:30:51
I can see that you need to suck Joseph Davids dick cause you work for him. But to the public Joseph hasn't done anything for Canadian bitcoiners except tax them 1.5% to trade btc...... He is a joke and Most people don't wanna anything to do with cavirtex because of his shitty image as a get rich quick guy... We have all seen his past shaddy attemps and shitty web sites trying to promote ponzi get rich schemes.

As the DXY goes higher the value proposition of buying a cheaper asset with a more valuable currency will go higher and higher. When the fulcrum point is reached and the max value can be purchased you will then see the largest transfer of wealth from the FAKE FED USD right into real PHYSICAL gold and silver shit all precocious metals. Remember the pattern Bubble -----&gt; followed by slight period of deflation -----&gt; Followed by a rampant acceleration of inflation IE devaluation of the USD and flock flocks to GOLD.... Bitcoin is similar to GLD in the Sense the lack of tangibility of a bitcoin to the average USD user, they will want to have a physical token to HOLD ON TO.... When you change the dynamics of a currency the stupid people have a real hard time understanding the value or the new instrument right away!
Once the chinese small investor sells all the gold and silver they need to cover the margin positions we should see gold go way way up! 
By the way THE USD is way way up this year and gold held pretty Steady.... Value for value they are both up this year!!!

Don't use a BTM period... 2% is criminal! Doesn't matter if its 3% or 15% people using the BTM's are either dumb, lazy or buying/selling on darkmarkets. Use a canadian exchange! Quadrigacx, Cointrader, Tarusexchange or local bitcoins. 0.5% trading fee on Quadrigacx and 0.5% on cointrader.... Do not give any these BTM criminals any money!

They bought a dead dog Business CAVIRTEX... And trying to force an economy or business when the real organic growth comes from years of solid business relationships and being attentive to what the customer wants and needs. The customer does not want a 65$ monthly fee just like they don't want to pay $20 a month to the other MOTHER FUCKERS the banks ... They should just close the doors lick their wounds and apply at Walmart!

BeardMilk I agree. Vendors had a choice to go on that website and with plenty of options they made that decision. Buyers choose to load funds into that site again they had other choices. The admins at evolution CHOSE to steal everyones money and BTC-E CHOSE to freeze them.... Everyone Has been exercising their individual liberties and rights! That is what bitcoin is about!!! ... Ruled by consensus not by anonymity..... If the majority of Bitcoin mining pools collude to make any one choice then thats the power we have instilled in them by allowing them to control the largest portion of the network. If you want your voice to be heard in bitcoin go buy some hardware and power up then come and talk!
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:18:16
No BS... You don't remember you freaking out and claiming that I am smoking crack? I order bitcoins using your service and receive nothing. I had reverse pay pal for you even to acknowledge I was a customer that was upset. Your service sucks and doesn't even work!  With in 5 minutes of making a complaint you were ensuing I was smoking crack.... It more than clear you a crack head.. As per your bitcoin service sucks.. Customer service sucks... I don't think people are too stoked to be buying bitcoins from a scamming drug addict!

7 days pending withdrawal..... I don't think we are getting money back

Sounds like you have all ready been compromised and trying to use this as the excuse to why your going to gox us!
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:07:19
Can we get proof once withdrawals start to come out? Karpeles said the same thing you are before he stole everyones money? We want to know JD isn't stealing our money! I don't think very many people trust him at all!
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:08:23
Also why have you never proven solvency? If you guys are soo above board why have you avoided the solvency issue for years!

I think cavirtex got hacked. Not the first time. They feel the risk of being hacked is greater going forward than the possibility of making any money. They are short or missing bitcoins to be able to be solvent. They are going to stop BTC and LTC withdrawals and only allow Fiat withdrawals that will be very slow and may never actually go through. For the next month the only possible way to get your cash or Bitcoins out of Cavirtex is going to be to sell your coins at the way lower price and withdrawal via bank deposit. This will destroy the order book and allow Cavirtex to buy cheap coins in a last ditch effort to avoid criminal proceedings for spending or losing customers funds by replacing coins as cheap as they can. Its highly unlikely that they will reimburse customers going forward. Mt Gox did the same exact thing before it announced everyone money was gone. Vault of Satoshi closed down but never halted any btc or ltc withdrawals. Cavirtex could easily withdrawal everyone ltc or btc manually to check each transaction for fraud or problems. If you have anything in Cavirtex hope for the best. Joseph Toth is a career scammer / crimminal with plenty of examples (Most of which as listed in this thread).
