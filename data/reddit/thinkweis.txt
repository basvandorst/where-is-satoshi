Very interesting if that is the account of the Dorian that is in the news. If you go back a ways and read his picture comments, it would seem that his grammar has severely deteriorated over the past few years.

Does anyone actually donate Bitcoins? I've had my address up on my site for over 2 years and I get around 5,000 hits a day. Never once received a donation. 
I think it's a great way to get people to publicize Bitcoin by making people comfortable seeing it everywhere and having it be something that is mainstream, but I wonder if people really donate them anymore. 
Edit: other than here.

So proud of my bank! They are the bank that represents the middle between traditional banking and Bitcoin. They are the most forward thinking bank I've ever heard of and I couldn't be happier.

I started  at the beginning. It really doesn't get any easier than that. 
But now that GPU and most personal mining is dead, I'm not sure what I want to do with it.

Excuse ME! I live in the Antarctic where last night could mean up to 6 months ago!
Between the arctic circle privilege is not having some AndreKoster make insensitive comments about time zones.

For that to work, I would have to provide over 50% of the blockchains in use. I don't think this little operation has that much reach. Also, I am not including anything but the blockchain as I know how suspicious people can be. Just a copy of my local blockchain to a DVD.

I agree about donating to reputable charities, but I would like a bitcoin option. Even if I just deposit directly to the charity from the exchange. My site gets around 20k hits a day and I would like to use that exposure for a good cause.
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:29:39
I just ordered it. I think it may have been a little slow because no one knew about it. Exposure to selling merchandise with bitcoin should rank higher on this sub than constant fluctuations. Important aspects of this sub-culture are constantly buried under massive speculation posts.

Because I am worried about the download detouring new people from getting involved I am offering the blockchain by mail as a means to get around data caps and slow download speeds at  . I don't think this will ever be a money making venture, but as a non-programmer, this is what I can contribute. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 05:29:03
Also, tip sent.

That's pretty tough. Sounds like you need a new best friend. Just tell me when you want to take me out for drinks and maybe some new TVs for us. 
Enjoy, congrats on your decisions.

Maybe it is hope. I think they will continue to rise in value slowly over time. Right now they seem to be stuck at $100 like they used to be stuck at $6, $13 and $33. Maybe they will go up and maybe not. I hope so for more reasons than just making money. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:40:53
I remember when bitcoins were worth a dollar and everyone said they should stop mining because the electricity costs too much. I know eventually it will cost more electricity, but I don't really want to miss out on the next big gain. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:04:36
This is way off. 
The price of Bitcoins have nothing to do with the profits of BFL and Avalon. They are already paid. BTC could drop to zero and the people that already paid for a unit (thousands) will still get their product. BFL and Avalon are not BTC stocks. They manufacture hardware and have already been paid for the units they are currently producing. You clearly have no idea what you are talking about and should learn to differentiate between a manufacturer of bitcon related hardware and bitcoin itself.

I figure it's all unrealized assets until you cash in, so I would hope to cash in directly to their tax free account. Ideally, I would never deal with any non-btc currency, so I never have to do any paperwork.

Ha! Yep. I just wanted to get it out there and see if people are interested. I would set up to accept bitcoin but I figure people without a blockchain wouldn't be very interested in that. I'll add it anyway in a bit for people that have an online wallet and want to create a paper wallet or something.
Improvements to come.

I am looking into a USB bulk order for that. As it stands now, the blockchain is 3 files that I put on 2 DVDs you can transfer straight into your bitcoin folder. I am trying to keep costs down as I don't get any discounts on shipping and DVD's can be ordered in bulk for pretty cheap. I want to make sure there is a market for this before I purchase a bulk USB order.

Also, what's your wallet address so I can tip you for the debug.

If you are working on it, maybe I could compensate you for it and put your work on a website that has been getting a large amount of views. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:53:40
There are and several of them and they are are very good. I would like my own to be extremely easy to work with, as well as include a dro pdown of all miner types so the new user is not confused. 
 
If we are to grow the base, we need to make it easy for late adapters. Too many are intimidated by the complexity of most of the sites/forums. I try to simplify this for them. My next step is an easy to use calculator that anyone could use with no bitcoin experience.   
@_date: 2013-02-25 21:11:35
Yes! I am on board for this as well. I think it will be people with Data-caps or bandwidth issues that will order by mail. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 05:23:47
Can you elaborate on what the problem was in PM? I just rolled it out when you went to the site so it may have been a cache issue.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:06:57
People were saying the same thing when they were worth pennies. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 00:07:21
This is geared toward those with slow connections, data caps, and those who would rather just have it delivered than fuss with waiting around. I think I'm a little early, but this will be more important down the road with how fast it's growing.

Would it be beneficial to do both? I will include the bootstrap.dat file from now on, but wouldn't the network kill any bad blocks even if I did mess with them?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:50:52


I agree, and that's why I offered around $1200 for the person that does it. 
I understand that updating the list will be a process on it's own, and I'm sure I'll have to pay out for that, but I'm willing to if I can't find time to do it on my own. 
Even if it is just ASICs, I'm sure I could afford a reasonable compensation to get it done. I would be happy to have a disclaimer that says GPU mining is dead. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 00:05:11
Startbitcoin.com is now selling the updated blockchain on DVD for those who have data caps or would rather not have their bandwidth tied up for however long it takes to download now or in the future. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 19:28:37
I wouldn't bother unless I had a GPU or an ASIC and GPU's will be too inefficient to mine with soon. Check out the comments on  to see if your question is answered there. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:16:44
That's why I wanted to come here first. I was wondering if there was an extremely transparent way I could do this so people would know that there donations are going to the right place.
