Well, yes, if I knew they were forced to keep their door open unless they were more profitable than others.
Backstory: Nicehash required at least 0.01 BTC to be mined before you could withdraw. For some, this was a good bit of time and I can understand that frustration.

Both are true.

That the equivalent of an exchange went down? I don't see the point here. VISA is not a currency.

Used my American VISA card 3 hours ago...

I would not consider it a transaction. It seems to me as a grey area(as I am no expert). Let's say you move something from one physical wallet to another. You do not record this cash movement, no? I could absolutely be wrong though.
I agree with the rest of what you said. The website is not easy to use. I understood it differently I guess. Right now the site has multiple tabs of Trading, Income, Spending.
I broke it down as the following, 
Trading - Anything I sent from me to another person. Paying back for a pizza, moving from coinbase to my personal wallet, etc. Simply trading. Again, I can see this grey area of this, is my coinbase wallet actually my wallet? When I move it off of there is this actually considered a trade? I should not have to pay for moving something from "my" exchange wallet to my personal wallet. 
Income - Mining or tips
Spending - Anything I bought using BTC. Newegg, Amazon gift cards, any website that supports BTC essentially.

You can just delete that row... I agree with you so I just simply removed that transaction for the site.

Not sure who is worse, a private corporation who has been warned about a security flaw or a government entity with little security.

That is very not true.

Hey I am a NiceHash user too! 
Anyways, basically they are supporting Bcash, which is essentially a scam. If it is profitable though, makes sense to support it for your user base. They are making millions off of fees and transactions, but they cannot support their newest peak of users(I think this is absolutely ridiculous to ask for since most major companies have issue when their peak users are occurring. RE: Any popular online video game release, any time reddit links to some offshoot site, etc.). Lastly, I believe OP is directly talking about S2X support. Again, if it is profitable why not support it? It might not be what the people want, but I believe people tend to forget Coinbase ***is*** a business.

Based on what and I were talking about, *all* events are taxable. This could include moving from one personal wallet to the next. There is no specific wording from what I have found on this.
The main thing I have seen, read, and heard is you should not need to pay for capital gains unless you are trading back from BTC to USD. Otherwise, everything else is fine, such as, buying an item off of newegg.

Problem with this is you are comparing BTC to USD. BTC has low fees in terms of BTC, not in terms of USD. The more BTC is worth the more the fee is worth in USD.
Do you complain about sales tax in the same sentiment?

[Here]( is the support link from coinbase on bitcoin cash.
Would I be able to buy/sell Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase? 
 For now, Coinbase plans on supporting bitcoin cash withdrawals. If this changes, we will notify all customers with an update e-mail.

Same here, the only thing I did not report was my DOGE back from college. I was unaware at the time and I spent maybe 100$ of it back then. I reported it most recently since I did have an event that was taxable with it, DOGE &gt; BTC, but since that is long-term capital gains, it did not matter.
