The proposal for crowdfunding is only for specific companies and investors have to have like $100K or something. It's not for smaller transactions.

I suggested they just give up on search all together since Google does a better job anyway. And partner with google for revshare on adwords like browser vendors do.
Also, I think they've moved slow and calculated because they're scared to death of fucking it up and going the way of Digg, but now the pressure is on to reach profitability so they have to reconcile those things.

I tried to fill out the survey but it wouldn't let me. They reached the gold quota and shut it down. I would have done it for free but I couldn't.

It's a very specific niche though. Everyone else are sysadmins, graphic designers, programmers etc. Using him for general programming tasks would be a waste of his talent. It would be like hiring John Carmack for the rift and then being like "we're changing focus. You're now working on the next great television!".

Reddit isn't profitable yet. They *need* to find more ways to monetize.

Eh, her lawsuit was pretty legitimate to be honest.

This is why all the things they've done have been separate sites from Reddit itself. They want to isolate it so they can't fuck it up.

Holy fuck, could you imagine? I'd bail immediately. This is basically the concept of Disqus and it's still terrible.

He deserved it though. If he was just upvoting his stuff it would be lame and bannable, but the community would have forgiven him. It's the downvoting that people hate him for.

It's just because there's *so many* people here. I rarely remember seeing the same person twice unless I have them tagged for some reason or they have pretty decent name recognition.

Fire? Farming? Iron? Steel? Nah, bitcoin! /s
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:05:22
When bitcoin transactions were a fraction of a cent the currency actually had a use. With the high transaction fees, it no longer makes sense to use it for most purchases because most purchases are for small amounts. Not being able to use it for everyday shopping means it doesn't compete with fiat currency. I can't imagine it gaining mainstream adoption besides from speculators. It's a bubble.

I know. This is why yours was one of the accounts I specifically excluded from my report.


These accounts were used to submit your site once or twice and abandoned. They're not going to start doing this with a site nobody on Reddit has heard of for karma. There's easier/better ways to karmawhore that wont get you banned.


This is not true. Mods cannot make rules that overrule ones set by Reddit admins.

While they may be circumstantial, the fact that the first submitter of the domain was a spammer is evidence that it is very unlikely to be a false flag by a competitor. The only thing it would do is expose people to a site that otherwise hadn't been mentioned on Reddit.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:17:21
Don't play dumb. You guys deliberately created over 90 accounts to submit your posts. You did this in an attempt to bypass Reddit's self-promotion and spam guidelines which allow for roughly 10% of submissions to be your own websites/services. You knowingly violating Reddit's spam rules. And not just in In several other cryptocurrency related subreddits as well.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:22:44




Yup. However, you haven't done enough on this account to be actionable.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:33:32


No, it isn't. It's extremely easy to spot this type of activity because it stands out so prominently among natural users.
Example: Your account's link to your alt account, DogecoinMachine, that you've now brought to my attention. Thanks!

Funny that you mention newsbtc. I'm also investigating a link between that site and btcfeed. They're very spammy too. [Example before I send it to @_date: 2015-03-31 04:32:46


1. I've provided additional evidence to the admins that directly links the spam accounts to the owner of the website.
2. The first account to ever submit the site to Reddit was a spam account.
3. The vast majority of the accounts submitting the domain are spam accounts.
When Reddit bans domains as opposed to just accounts it's because it's easy to make new accounts and/or bypass bans. It also serves to punish the offenders for spamming Reddit. Or at least avoid rewarding them with traffic they were seeking when they started spamming in the first place.
Almost none of the btcfeed.net submissions were natural. Reddit is a site to share things you find, not to spam your own sites for traffic or SEO. It's in violation of [the site's rules]( Which you should read since you seem to be here in an official capacity representing Coinbase. Also [Reddit's self-promotion guidelines.]( You don't want to accidentally get Coinbase banned either. Though in this case they'd be much more likely to just kill your account since many other legit users submit coinbase also.

Shitloads of merchants use Stripe. They offer an API so a lot of the time purple never know it's Stripe since they've chosen to use an unbranded widget.

Hey man, I just kind of stumbled in this sub searching for something else. Just wanted to say I recently started watching Foundation and I think it's great. Thanks for doing it. I especially liked the one with Elon Musk in the Tesla factory. The whole series deserves more views.
