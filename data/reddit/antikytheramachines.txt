if he was smart any significant amount was more likely kept in a cold wallet on a machine not ever connected to the internet. I'd be looking carefully at any old laptops, especially one running a version of Linux.

i made a geek dad joke about bitcoin yesterday, at a large family christmas party. I was interested to see if anyone in the group noticed. one of my 20 something nieces asked if i had any. I said "not enough" which is true. I have zero.

I'm new to all of this so I might be wrong...
Dont the miners uphold the BTC network and take fees and new coins currently?
To have a second network wont you need a second set of miners, except they wont be mining just collecting fees?
How is this better than just having double the miners on the original network?

I can make pretty good choices about lunch. If i'm not happy I dont go back. With housing I see what I am getting, and have it tested by experts before hand.
you cant make educated choices about health care without a 7 year tertiary education. even if you could, you cant evaluate the choices you didnt take. the decisions should be made by the experienced provider, or perhaps get a second opinion. but the decisions should never be made by someone profiting from the decisions. or else you get $600 Epipen (in australia an Epipen with prescription costs under $40)

i thought only BCash people referred to Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Core". does that mean the Bitcoin.org link above is run by BCash scammers?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:53:45
not 100% sure of this but i believe the exchange holds deposits for both parties and the contracts are matched between two users. so the exchange take their fee and the losers account pays into the winners account.
it likely was leveraged so not 2m, but 200k or 20k depending on how high the leverage was.

can anyone Eli5 why GDAX historical data for BTC now only goes back half a day on the 1hr and 6hr charts? did they claim to have technical difficulties or is it part of the scam they are running with BCash?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:13:56
for this futures market, which will be settled in cash, it is matched contracts. so for example You sell a contract and I buy it. This particular contract states that on Dec 31 the price will be 15000. On Dec 31 we settle the contract. if the price is actually 20000 you pay me the 5000 difference. if the price is actually 10000 I pay you the 5000 difference. Because either party may have to pay the difference, both parties have to have assets held by the exchange.
In effect you have "shorted" the price, because you make a profit when the underlying commodity price falls.

does GDAX have guaranteed deposits? 
edit: seems it does for US customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:10:56
to me it seems the bank is worried about extra costs associated with the reporting it will be required to do on coinbase transfers. closing the account saves the bank money. keep the account open and continue making coinbase transfers until the bank closes the account themselves. 
then report all the transfers to whichever government agency the bank would be required to keep records for. so the agency will contact the bank and ask for reports for your account, and when they discover a lack of reporting, all other accounts.

just used these for $100k income for a single living in California vs Australia.

[in that shouting episode]( he kept telling the audience he "was a millionaire before Bitcoin", to me that sounds like someone stressed out because he has just lost a bunch of money selling BTC and buying Bcash after the fork. you know, right before BTC went through the roof and BCash dropped like a stone.

completely naive question: looking at those four trade platforms GDAX seems the most active. as the price on GDAX was rising through $8800 and looking at the others, hibtc seems to lag behind GDAX by ~$20USD and the other two by ~$100USD. is this usual or just happened to be the case when i was comparing them?
or is this perhaps something to do with the difference between USD and USDT?
