Eventually I'd say you're right, the market caps of the respective markets will become fractions of the original wealth, but initially 60% of inflaticoin is owned by people who don't want it and 40% of bitcoin is now owned by people who prefer inflaticoin, so there's a bit of wealth redistribution that happens when people sell the coins they don't believe in.

Why not just set the contract in terms of the agreed bitcoin amount or $1,000,000. That would be a legal contract. They'd much rather follow through on sending 4 bitcoin to you instead of $1,000,000. Think of it as insurance in fiat.

You're saying the only way for bitcoin to win.. is to not have competitors? It has decentralized currency competitors that are resilient as it.. So it will never be the "only" currency in town.

It could be linked to the license place number. Type in someone's license place into an app to see if they accept tips for good driving, then send them an anonymous tip.

I guess  could actually solve this problem.
Alice sends 100,000, Bob sends 100,000, and Carol sends 100,000.
Alice's 30,000 bit payment comes from the mixing service and arrives in her payee's address, and 70,000 are returned to her in a new address. The same happens for Bob's and Carol's transactions. This requires everyone to agree to send equally sized inputs, but for a large enough mixing service, transactions could be banded together so that the amount required is pretty close to what you are trying to send. Everyone just has to send the amount of the largest desired payment in the group's transaction.
Am I thinking clearly? Without equal sized inputs from all parties, 1-3 doesn't really help.
Edit: Also, if this is something being built into a wallet, care must be given that future payments won't combine coins from the change address of the mixed coins with other coins stemming from that original premixed address, or your anonymity disappears.

hoarders, anyone holding bitcoin benefits from the expanded Bitcoin network.

I'm disappointed Apple didn't go a more "revolutionary" (i.e. Bitcoin) route here, however, I'd like to know if you could name one instance of Apple going after anyone over a torrent. I've never once heard of Apple going after people torrenting their own software, much less people for music or movies.

It might not make sense to fork to make a inflationary coin out of a deflationary one, but what i'm really trying to get at is that there may be something to cause disagreement that might cause a large scale split after we've came to count our wealth in bitcoins.
