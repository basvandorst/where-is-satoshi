That certainly not going to happen. Trump has an unstable relationship with (former) US allies, he is firing up tensions with countries like China and Iran, he has weak support within the US itself the media is totally against him. Also US has $20 trillion in debts and going into a new war will add a couple of trillions more to that which is a disaster for Trump administration.

So it means it's going to be regulated?
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:14:48
As long as China has cheap electricity and hence major mining power they'll remain the authority of bitcoin markets, like it or not.

"We have to trust them (banks) with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible."
"The usual solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its central position, the company can override the users, and the fees needed to support the company make micropayments impractical."
-- Satoshi Nakamoto, Feb. 11 2009
Micropayments were clearly one the main concerns of Satoshi and why he invented bitcoin.

More intersting is, although they look scammy but I neither see any scam report about them nor any successful transaction and this site is active more than a year.

In recent FATF attempts they're trying to regulate and de-anonymize cryptocurrencies to fight with so called money-laundering, now here is their own banks and fiat currencies.

It'll go back. Don't worry guys :)
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:13:15
Thanks for the info, is there any place to see where the block is and estimately when it ends?
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:32:47
They simply have value because people think they have value. Bitcoin's value is not directly from hash power, it's due to huge demand.

This is getting ugly, if you transfer more coins you can pay lower fees or no fees at all (sounds familiar?) I don't know if this continues where we are heading!
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:29:04
Well as I said it's was Electrum fee, I don't change fees manually. Anyway what to do now?
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:42:40
I do but it's not 10 cents for $10, usually it's like $2 (recent days)
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:00:40
One question, how to find out who mined a transaction?
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:28:44
Just got it! You need to look for the block and then see who mined it.

No one on reddit can give an accurate tax advice. Consult with a tax expert, there are different loopholes in each country that only tax experts would know.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:48:46
Consumption and import taxes can do them. Income and capital gain taxes are a huge theft, they're anti work and innovation.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:20:11
Wallets? You serious?! Wallets can not do anything when miners skip txs with fees &lt; 200 satoshis.

That coinanalytics you mentioned, is this like a paid service?
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:45:40
Very true metaphor!
@_date: 2017-04-17 10:10:49
Fiat is backed by nothing. Crypto currencies in other hand backed by super huge computational power, for me it's a very tangible thing actually!
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:58:37
Yeah, that's more precise. Also two reasons fiat currencies exist are people adoption for a large period of time and lack of knowledge, still many people think US dollar is backed by gold!
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:38:06
Damn these fees! It's 2019 and we still have this issue.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:01:25
Not a kill switch. It needs another market crash, they can declare it's against national interests and illegalize any exchanging, then bitcoin will be like digital drug than digital gold.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:19:24
It reminds me of Ferdinand Hodler.

Dollar is international reserve means other countries back their fiat with dollar.
Who creates dollar? Federal Reserve
Who owns the Fed? International and central banks
Who runs the economy of each country? Banks
Who lose the most from fiat distrust? Central banks
Conclusion: There is no other countries when we talk money, it's a single large network of banks.

That's true. We think governments are paralyzed, they're clueless and and we're going to kill central banks anyway!    
Government is not doing anything, not because they can not to, because everything is good right now; stocks at all time high, debts at all time high (banksters happy) and dollar is still international reserve. But seriously do you think they will sit down and watch us when another crash happens, people lose their faith into stocks, bonds, fiat and migrate to cryptos? They can illegalize any exchanges to major cryptos, yet they'll benefit from blockchain and will create their own bitcoin and force everyone to accept it (Mr Robot?). We know they can do it and we know they'll not cease this enormous power of creating money out of thin air until maybe entire civilization is down. So enjoy your life and benefit from this new technology as much as you can.

From someone who has this experience, it's very risky! One scenario is you sell now, it'll go to 5700 then correct to 5100. I sold some at 4600 and here we are! lol Don't think it'll go back below 4600 anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:05:06
Too good to be true.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:14:12
I suggest observe the market for a few weeks to get a general idea. Also it's not stock market or forex you need to know the technology behind these cryptos and read white papers if you can, and then invest your money.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:44:52
They do. They love to make their own currency international reserve not replacing it with something totally out of their control.

Fomo and influx of newbies everyday imo.

It's feeless not free! You have to do POW yourself which is a pita right now.

As long as newbies keep coming, we won't see crashes but honestly 40k at this point is risky unless you can afford losing it.
