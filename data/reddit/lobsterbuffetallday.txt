I concede that consumer protection is amazing and I don't see how that would be applied to the blockchain in a way that made sense. 
- "Its a crazy hassle to get setup" 
I've set up and used my coinbase account in less time than it took to get my debit card working properly with Citibank. Are there any more or less steps taken to open a traditional account? The only reason it seems easier IMO is that people know it and are familiar with it. Subjective opinion on my part, but I propose a number of kids going from 17 -&gt; 18 years of age be participants in setting up their first financial accounts; Chase, Citi, etc ... and some account with a crypto currency exchange - presumably gdax/coinbase.
Also there is almost zero transaction fees when using the gdax exchange:
 1) Zero transaction fee when selling
 2) Zero transaction fees when buying/selling with limit orders.
If you haven't transferred your assets to gdax by now you're doing it wrong.

So, that $250 limit is something I only recently dealt with. If you have another account buy or transfer the amount you want to trade with into the gdax account. That took 5-8 minutes for the transfer to go through, the only con is that you're at the mercy of whatever other exchange you're using for that first transaction. 
Just remember coinbase owns gdax so initially you are making a coinbase account, but then when you go to login at gdax.com, you are using your coinbaise account credentials. Look up the fees 
I'm not making a statement about how tech saving young adults are, I'm saying that to the untrained young mind, objectively crypto accounts are not more difficult than traditional financial accounts.

Hey there, I'll edit the post to reflect what happened. Short version - my last transaction came through, but they never told my why uploading my drivers license got me kicked

It is fraud if they take $2000 from me and do not provide service of any kind or even indicate any record of it.

I definitely stated that I made the purchase, meaning the $2000 was withdrawn from my account. Lol dude nice try. I also mentioned it took place last week meaning they've had my money for a bit now. They don't show it as a pending transaction or anything, just gone. That looks extremely shady given that they are trying to close the account with no mention of this missing 2k. That is in fact fraud if they attempt to keep it. 
Lastly why again did you mention an "understanding of banks"? I asked you what banks had to do with the definition of fraud, all you've done is describe what took place - yes I purposely wired them 2k with the expressed purpose of purchasing ethereum, and yes they could potentially send it back, but guess what troll? They haven't done either. But please, go ahead misdirect the question stated at you again.

What does the definition of fraud have to do with banks?
