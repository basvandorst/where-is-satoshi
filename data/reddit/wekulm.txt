They're one in the same ultimately.

Sorry, my fault.  See, that's when I decided to buy in.  I could release you back too your gains if I'd just sell, but screw you.  I enjoy the obsession and I'm gonna keep it permanently down.

It's our combined power.  Together.  You and I.

Well no kidding... Learn something new everyday...  Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:12:54
Very well.  300k is the year ATH.  Noted.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:54:13
Only the part at the end sounds wrong.  You won't be putting a phone in your pocket.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:07:19
You should put the options in your edit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:54:44
No...  Is there referral bonuses?

Memes are powerful.  Memes put Trump in office.  Don't discount the importance of childish memes.

Can you buy the domain?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:52
I think you responded to wrong person.  Though I am frustrated too as transfers are pending.  I managed to buy .00404875 Bitcoin at 12000.  It was my test case with credit card.  I've made $12.   Whew!.   I'm personally expecting that dip (I know, I know), and hopefully the transfer goes through before that happens.  If it doesn't happen, still can't have done anything about it.  So it goes...
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:14:00
Sounds like they read a single article.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:40:52
Feel better that someone else did the same thing. We'll be alright.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:08:04
Ah, you just cleared up so much confusion.  Got it.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:09:01
I'd like it to stay up long enough to sell what I bought (foolishly) at 17.8.  then drop to 8, so I can buy in now that all my transfers went through.  By desiring this we can be assured it will only go up.

@_date: 2017-12-30 16:39:30
You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:04:48
I signed up about a week ago.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:48:16
Only no fee the opposite way.   Buy if it goes down, sell if goes up.  That's no fee.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:22
I bought at 17.6 but my trade hasn't gone through so I'm holding whether I like it or not.  I like it.
Edit: will go back up at 14.8.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:18:54
Yeah, thats the trick of it.  You have to be ahead of it.  Real easy to miss a big upswing or downswing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:57
Betting on what the price will be rather that the supply and demand of bitcoins themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:58:03
Cash to Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:35:33
I'm kinda new too and was confused, but here's what I've learned.
First you have to buy and need an exchange.  Coinbase is the big one but everyone here hates them and they charge high fees.  It's easier to use though.  There's also Gemini but it's a bit more confusing, not much though.  If you use coinbase you'll upload your driver's license and link your back account.  You can then, a few days later or maybe a week, put dollars or Bitcoin into your coinbase account.  If you directly buy Bitcoin is will lock in that price and you'll be stuck with that price until the transfer goes through 6 to 10 days or so).   Once your funds are in coinbase you can transfer them to gdax which is owned by the same company so there's no charge to do that.  It's cheaper to move your funds from gdax than coinbase so you'll want to before moving them into a wallet.  A wallet is just something that security stores your private key for you.  A software wallet is just an app on your phone or computer.  A hardware wallet is a device you buy and is safer.  You could also just use paper but it's a bit confusing.
To move money from an exchange to a wallet, you just "export" or withdraw from the exchange.  When you do so you'll wait 6 hours or so to see the funds show up in your wallet.
That's pretty much it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:44:59
Yeah.  Bitcoin to Bitcoin, incoming.  I had 50 that I moved to gdax then an online wallet and thought maybe I made mistake somewhere, but that money is all in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:56:12
No less than I did.   We did the exact same thing. Do you also have a wife to answer to?  We'll be alright.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:39:54
The is the saddest comment I've ever read.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:13:01
Question if you don't mind.  So, could you have 12 word passphrase for a paper wallet.  Could I destroy the private key and rely on just the words then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:47:52
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:52:33
I had trouble too and then I messaged support.  No response but was verified shortly afterwards.  This was 2 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:38:54
I'll be looking for same shortly, just commenting to revisit.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:05:06
Wow, that is the slowest response I've ever gotten on Reddit.  Haha.  Glad I could help.
