To start with, you assume that hodlers just squirrel away their coins and then never look at them again until they can buy their tropical island. However, most long-term hodlers don't behave like that. They buy stuff with bitcoin on the few services that allow them to do it. In some cases (people who have "crossed over" more or less and have most of their income or wealth in crypto), they also convert to fiat if need be to pay for stuff, since not enough shops and services accept bitcoin. "Complete hands off" is not hodling, as you seem to think. 
Rather, hodling is a decision not to "cash out", dumping their bitcoin for fiat and then go back to living as if it was 2009 again. Hodling is not Scrooge McDuck, but quite the opposite.  


So much wrong in this short sentence, but let me just focus on one thing: Selling your bitcoin for fiat just because the fiat rate is up? Or the reverse - panic selling? How is that less "greed" than staying in crypto regardless of fiat fluctuations?
Flip-flopping back and forth between fiat and bitcoin according to the whims and mood of the market price, as you seem to advocate, is not better for bitcoin. People staying fully in bitcoin on the other hand, as fully as possible, and using bitcoin when actual bitcoin transactions are possible - but not dumping their bitcoin for shiny fiat bank savings, AKA hodlers, are exactly what helps bitcoin.

Your reasoning is only correct if you never intend to move your coins ever, or if you think fees will stay this low forever.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:29:40
Rising will not go on forever. In the most extremely optimistic scenario, where bitcoin takes over the world economy, once the bitcoin market cap hits parity with the market cap of all the money in the world (on the magnitude of *very roughly* 100 trillion dollars (equivalent to a market valuation of 5 million dollar per coin)), price cannot rise any further, except for whatever percentage per year that the world economy grows. There is a sort of theoretical cap on the bitcoin price. Even before that, price rising will slow down and start to level off into an S-curve.
As for "why would anyone want to spend bitcoin *when* price is rising (ie while still in the transitional stage towards world domination): If you get all your salary in bitcoin, you want to spend it for the same reason a fiat person spend their salary on rent, food etc. Also, if you have made nice profits, you don't mind spending some of those profits. People spend bitcoin every day. I do. Many do. If you fear your stash is going to shrink, spend the bitcoin on what you want to buy, then buy more next time you're buying (after all, you saved fiat by using bitcoin instead).

Different situation we're having here than the Coinbase/BCH debacle RV was referring to. 
here we have someone using a political (or otherwise government mandated) position to sell/buy/short something before using the political powers to affect the same market, that's a pretty bad kind abuse of the governmental system. The politician (or government goon) hasn't contributed anything whatsoever for crypto, yet thanks to his governmental powers he is able to profit perversely from it.
As a libertarian, it just fuels my belief that the governmental system is something fundamentally perverse.

What? It is not "exchanges charging a premium", it's sellers on the exchanges charging a premium. Do you even understand how an exchange work? Seriously WTF.


The problem is entirely caused by government regulation in the first place!
The reason bitcoin sell at a premium in SKorea and India is because their statist governments have strong currency controls that do not allow their currencies to flow freely with the outside world, and therefore has a distorted currency rate. If they had operated less like 20th century socialist walled gardens, and instead allowed international transactions to operate freely like in well functioning economies elsewhere, then the local bitcoin price would not be at a premium.
Another way to look at it is that if in fact bitcoin is selling at a 20% premium, then what this means is that the government has actually inflated the KRW by 20% over what it's actual value should be. Only bitcoin exchanges (due to bitcoin being able to flow freely everywhere) show the correct value of the local currency. And it turns out, the correct value of the KRW is 20% lower than what the government has propped it up to.

Except Coinbase actually buys and sells bitcoin that you can withdraw and use.
From the look of it, this Robinhood thing will just be selling tracking certificates, not actually bitcoins that you can hold.
This is absolutely horrible for bitcoin, if so, and essentially introduces the same bullshit that has held the gold market in control by big banks, because you can create fake/unbacked gold ETFs - and now the same thing is coming to Bitcoin.
Why the fuck is everyone cheering this? This is turning bitcoin into fiat money (you have to trust Robinhood that they are actually holding the bitcoins for you).

It is not even an exchange, it is a certificate tracker that will take your money in exchange for them holding bitcoin for you (at best!) that you cannot even withdraw. You can also not deposit. people who fall for this bullshit will not be getting any actual bitcoins. They will not be able to use bitcoins.
Also, if this catches on it is only a matter of time before we see more of these certificates that may well be running on fractional reserve and no one will be able to tell the difference between Robinhood's bitcoin certificates and other similar app's unbacked certificates. 
This is a sure way of turning bitcoin into the same bank controlled situation as the gold market is in.

Bitcoin is valuable because it allows transactions with certain desirable characteristics. It's current price is based on the assumption that it will be widely used in the future.
If usage trends indicate it will not be widely used in the future, price will drop. Just because something is rare it is not valuable. Only if it is rare and desirable does it have a permanent value. 
You can't have as a "store of value" in the long run something that doesn't live up to it's promise. It is extremely naive to think that price would hold up forever if wider adoption doesn't happen.
I agree that it is better to hodl bitcoin than to not have any bitcoin, of course. I said that as well. But if you don't *use* bitcoin, you don't contribute to the long term value growth. Just removing bitcoins from the market increases price somewhat and temporarily, but not as much as increasing the network effect by using it and rewarding merchants that adopt it as a payment.
EDIT: And to add one more thing: Bitcoin's main advantage over alts is it's network effect, as the default and established coin. However, in terms or scarcity, it is not unique. if scarcity was bitcoin's main benefit, then any stupid hodlercoin would be just as good as a "store of value". But it isn't. Because it is only a store of value if the asset is desirable for something other than hodling.
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:34:58
The point is that bitcoin would not have any value if everyone refused to spend their bitcoins. The only reason bitcoin has any current and future value is because people currently use it, and because it is expected that this usage will increase in the future.
If you don't want to use bitcoin, that's fine, that's everyone's right, you can just let others spend theirs, but at least realize that all your expectations for future price is dependent on other people spending their bitcoins as intended.

@_date: 2018-02-08 09:22:50
You clearly don't understand that the one and only form of backing that the US dollar has, and which bitcoin hasn't, is that US dollar are accepted as payment for taxes. When people say that the USD is backed by the full force of the government, this is exactly what is meant. You can pay your taxes with dollar, and only dollar. This is why US dollar is the dominant currency.
Now if this were to change so bitcoin gains the same status (you can pay taxes with it), it would be so huge and important I can hardly think of any other change that would be the same magnitude. (Ofc Arizone is just one state, but as a start, it is a big deal).
What matters is not whether you want to opay your taxes in bitcoin or not, or if you for some weird reason would prefer to go through the process of selling your bitcoin before paying your taxes (or, equally, refrain from buying bitcoin because you prefer to keep fiat to pay taxes with)... whatever you choose doesn't matter. What matters is that you *could* pay taxes with bitcoin.

Price will stabilize the day widespread use begins. Usage is the cause, and stability the effect. Widespread use is what makes bitcoin more akin to regular currencies (in terms of volatility) and less of a crazy speculative swings thing. If people use bitcoin for daily use, the pumping and dumping on exchanges have a relatively smaller impact.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:05:37


Not true. Bitcoin provides a value in providing a way to transact money between people in a certain way. 
Part of that value lies in unique benefits it provides to those who choose to transact using it. Another part of the value is that it can in some ways (arguably) be a much more efficient way of doing certain things than the existing systems doing these things today (banks etc).
This means that bitcoin "is worth something" in the same way that for example Apple is worth something (it sells computers and smartphones that some people consider giving them unique benefits + it also sells computers and smartphones that can solve certain problems better than not using computer/smartphones can). Or similar to Walmart, which sells stuff cheaply and has an efficient distribution network. That's why shares of Walmart *are worth something*.
People who say BTC isn't worth anything only say so because the only thing they've comprehended about bitcoin is "lol you can get rich buying it", but there is a reason behind it all, and that reason is that bitcoin provides a valuable service.
Exactly how valuable, and how sustainable that value is in a longer run, and what the predicted future value of that service is, all these things are being negotiated by the market right now.
But to say it has no actual value is incredibly dumb (yet common).

Sure, I agree that cross border tx are one of the main use cases, but I also don't see what's wrong with buying $49 things with it, especially when LN comes in wider use. 
Gold was used as a basis for currency for thousands of years. It was *money*. Its current value is mainly a reflection of it's past role as money. Bitcoin needs to become widely used as money.
Don't get me wrong. I hodl most of my coins. I also want to see bitcoin function as digital gold. I also think on-chain coffee buys are ridiculous. However, I do only see bitcoin (on-chain) become digital gold once it is used through 2nd layer as the backing for a payment system. Then bitcoin will become money, like gold was. If that doesn't happen (widespread adoption or a realistic scenario for it to become so in the future), it will pump to a certain point and then all of a sudden everyone will realize that they are holding shares in the 2024 version of pets.com, a promising tech that doesn't materialize and that doesn't have a sound basis as a useful service. Then everyone will dump their bitcoins and the one reason people found bitcoins desirable (price goes up) is reversed to it's exact opposite.


People with this mentality usually actually just want to hold a pile of fiat, and they see bitcoin as a good way to increase their fiat pile. So they buy bitcoin with the intent of dumping it for fiat when the price has risen. Ironically, the reason that scheme is able to work out for them is because there are also other people who *do* want bitcoin for the benefits it brings (other than fiat value appreciation).

If history is any guide, people who sold will typically not realize it is time to start buying again until it's too late. "What? Bitcoin is skyrocketing you say? That can't be right, I thought it was dead two years ago! Nah, it's just a bubble, I'm not falling for that again." ...and then... even further down the cycle... "OK, maybe it's time for me to re-enter after all, what is it up to now? Holy schmolly, 15,000! Well, that's a bummer but I can still make a good profit if it goes up even further"... and then, since he entered so late, he is also late to sell, so the final conclusion is "What the hell, down to 8000!? I knew this shit is just dropping, how could I fall for this once again... Oh well, better sell now than after it's fallen further... I can always buy back at 2000 later on" ... and then rinse and repeat 3 years later.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:10:54
Bitcoin is volatile because most of the coins are just one click away from being sent to an exchange and swapped for fiat.
Currencies in wide and daily use however, you can't treat you money like that. You have rent to pay next week, and groceries to buy on Friday, and you get your salary two weeks from now, and the company has bills to pay. You can't just take all your money and start swapping them for some other currency because you heard a rumor yesterday. Forex traders can, but most of the money are not on forex traders accounts. Prices are set and contracts are signed with set prices. The more bitcoin takes on such a role, the less volatile it will be. Maybe, or maybe not, we will ever reach a point where bitcoin is used daily like dollar is in the US and the euro in Europe etc, but if we get even close to that point, then volatility slows down, as more and more of the currency "market cap" is locked up in actual transactions, rather than speculative accounts.
