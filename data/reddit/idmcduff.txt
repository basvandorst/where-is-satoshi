if you play lots of chess its easy to understand why 
We learned last time when you want to sell big time if your money is on 1 exchange your scrood because you dump bitcoin on lets say Hitbtc ON A 8,000.00 MARKET HITBTC WILL START TRADEING AT 7400 WHILE THE REST OF EXCHANGES ARE STILL AT 8,100.00 OR 7,900.00 $1,000,000.00 SOLD WILL AFECT THE MARKET SO ITS BETTER TO BUY OR SELL ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES WHEN YOUR DOING VOLUME

Fools never make money 
 A pattern has emerged of manipulation this is whats going to happen next .and on my next post i will let u in on the secret.  A lot of good news coming in the next few weeks  on criptos and bitcoin and price will go up slowly when it gets to about 202 billion it will go up fast to about 217 b  because of good news like sec or fidelity then as we all jump in bammmmm!!!! down to 150 billion just like that so just keep donating to the manipulators. orrr my suggestion is no money in until 300 b you wont miss the boat  if this thing is going to take off 300 b is still early enuff to get in   and then at like 290 b you hold the cards you can sell everything and let the manipulators stand there with there dks in there hands ,or you can risk it just wait for it ,wait for it ,wait for it so get out now bamm selll tonight  and get back in at 120 b-150b  it is going there for sure buy some gold with your money or some chines  tec industry  or 5g phone company's good luck

2 trillion dollars is a very small percentage of money that is circulation around the planet see every bank would have to hold some how many banks are there in the world alone also fanatical institutions trading platforms not mentioning peoples savings accounts and wallets  also every store that excepts bitcoin would have to have a few thousand dollars worth I bet that alone would add up to a couple of  trillion forget about me and you imagine if bitcoin started to be used as a currency not replacing the dollar but it was used like a check book buying furniture ect the world economy without holdings is 100 trillion include holdings god knows is I just saying 1.5% it is easily possible just eBay and amazon alone will  hold 20 to 40  billion dollars in there electric accounts daily

Few companies in the world measure the money they handle in the quadrillions of dollars. One, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, cleared and settled $US1.6 quadrillion ($2.1 quadrillion) of global financial market trades in equities, bonds and derivatives in 2014 see the money being used this is only one fanatical clearing house I'm not talking about gdp look at everything and do the math 2 trillion is nothing.

 The food retail industry comprises foods sold at food retailers such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, drug stores, convenience stores and foodservice facilities. Total retail and food service sales in the United States amounted to about 5.32 trillion U.S. dollars in 2015. Renters Paid Record $535 Billion in 2015 A $5 trillion transition is taking place in the electric vehicle market

just eBay and amazon alone will  hold 20 to 40  billion dollars in there electric accounts daily imagine if those were bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:02:46
your missing if it were used as currency every retailer would have to hold a certain amount its not just what we as individuals have in our wallets include  business ,banks ,governments ,and people ur only including  peoples personal holdings  just eBay and amazon alone will  hold 20 to 40  billion dollars in there electric accounts daily 
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:08:46
yes I am, and the reason why is because when it gets used a currency governments, banks, and, business will have to have some.  your thinking of this as a company its not you have to imagine if it were excepted as a currency everyone using it including corporations would have to have it in there holdings that's 100 x more than what would be used buy individuals. Think of total sales of apple only in bitcoin now use this in all businesses' God knows how many dollars are in circulation in accounts in mattress in electronic holding in every company in the world how about other currency's yen euro ect.    just eBay and amazon alone will  hold 20 to 40  billion dollars in there electric accounts daily
