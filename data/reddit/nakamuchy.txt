Did I see $10,000 there?
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:51:49
Good idea. But Methinks there should be some sort of verification those who choose to deliver need to go through. More like how Uber does it...
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:12:34
And why isn't a golden cheeseburger $1300?

That there'll be another economic collapse is only a matter of time. This thing happens in cycles. The macro economy can only take so much before it resets. Any educated economist will tell you this.

@_date: 2017-11-05 16:11:50
You'd have sold earlier. That's just the truth. No point regretting not getting in earlier if you actually didn't. That means you wouldn't have understood the basics enough to hold till now.

Just went over his posts. He tipped a lot more.

I'm 60% in so far. Need it to dip a little more before dumping the rest capital on it.

One note. It's written "world". Omitting the letter "l" makes it weird.

Learnt about it from mainstream news website who all painted gloomy pictures, but never took out time to research it myself. In August 2017, I did my own research, watched Andreas on YouTube and read the white paper. Knocked my head on the door for several days later wondering why I didn't take this personal look earlier. Went ahead to buy some for myself and certainly hodling. 
Should be buying more altcoins this month. I see a clear picture. Bitcoin becomes the reserve currency of the internet, while the altcoins become the main transactional currencies. Let me dream on...
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:10:33
I want to see the future. I want to be a millionaire.

Mainstream journalism at it again. This wasn't unknown to the industry.

That's deep!

A 1950 technology that can't keep up with the internet. Load up on Bitcoins and thrash that card.
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:49:56
I don't buy the dip. I just buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:49:32
I don't know why anyone should panic at this point. As volatile as Bitcoin may be, it's nearly a certainty that the price will go to ~$8k

All investment is gambling. Better take the chance now than not take it at all. And if I wanted company, I'd rather be in that of Ver, Antonopoulos and co than in that of Trump or Yellen.

Widespread adoption is a certainty. It takes the population of one or two countries of the world to confirm widespread adoption of Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't need the whole world. However, we know many more countries will join the race and then adopt it. What I can't go nuts about is moon price for one Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:33:04
At $25k in 2024 it will still be too cheap
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:33:04
Actually, they have seen it. They just haven't accepted it.

The point is not to hodl and then cash out for fiat at a later point in the future. Instead, the point is to hodl such that you can easily spend Bitcoins in the future when it must have appreciated enough against fiat to make you a millionaire (in Bitcoins or fiat, however you like).
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:08:08

Buffet seeing no value in Bitcoin is easily equivalent to Western Union seeing no value in the telephone. Old giants don't see that far.

What you should do is learn about it first before you conclude that it's gambling. Hodling BTC apparently isn't the same as knowing what you are hodling.

He said it, $3045 is the bottom!
