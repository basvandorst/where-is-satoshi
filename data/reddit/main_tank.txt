Sounds like you're way too irresponsible for adulthood anyway. 
Betting millennial or younger.
I never messed with Mt. Gox because I wanted to see where crypto would go around that time. I never jump feet first into anything and I only just got into it after doing enough research to be comfortable with my own involvement. Which is essentially mining on equipment I already have, plus a little more I bought to help it along.
I have my wallet info in an actual safe, plus stored encrypted in a few places online.
I've NEVER had the wrong address because I know how to use Copy/Paste functions and I double check things before I do things I might regret.
In decades of carrying wallets in my lifetime, I've never lost any wallet. I've misplaced keys, never lost them permanently. I've never been so irresponsible as I was taught as a kid to treat your wallet like it's another dick.
BTC doesn't have to take off mainstream. Something more user friendly could easily take its place, just like all of the early internet protocols no longer in use or made simpler by other technologies. With your attitude, we would have given up on the internet because the layperson would think TCP/IP to be too confusing.
Not everyone can be a functioning adult. You can pretend you're essentially the bumbling star of an infomercial to satiate your biases, but if you think anyone's going to abandon a beneficial technology because YOU want to pretend you're THAT stupid, then you just might be, just not in the way you're pretending to be.
Even still, we all can't be the CEO, the world needs its janitors too.

It HAS to ebb and flow, it's not just going to pump up and stay. People have to take profits, that's just how it works. You look at the trendlines though, it certainly is trending more up than down and doing so naturally, and THAT is what you want to see.

You can still search with Yahoo, but no one says "Just Yahoo it" now do they?

Can't we just simplify this and call them what they really are? Retarded.

That's a smart move.


That's exactly right, but if you look at a longer portion of time, like a 3 month, or a year long trend, you'll see overall, it's gone up by quite a bit. But yes, if it goes up to 10K, it WILL come back down. In a bull (upward) market, it will go down less and less holding an overall upward trend. In a bear (downward) market, it will increase how much it goes down, and it will not peak as high when the pendulum swings back in that direction.


$6,000 to $10,000 is a $4,000 jump, that's a 66% jump. If you sold half, you have your profits. in your case, ~$100, and you'd still have enough bitcoin to be valued at $232. A total profit of $132. People see that with say, a few thousand dollars and it makes them more optimistic. They can cash out those profits and still hold about the same dollar value in their portfolio.
Optimism will drive the price higher. People putting in more money, more demand, also will. And don't be fooled when the price dips down like it did when you bought in. When your gut wrenches and everyone is jumping ship, THAT is when you buy in, provided nothing absolutely catastrophic happened in the news. In early January, just that happened. Lots of fake news about countries banning crypto and false rumors took a toll on the price that it hasn't quite bounced back from just yet.

I went to eCigs back before they were widely available at the tail end of 2009 and switched to them exclusively. I kept using them for years, lowering my dosage little by little in the last 2 years I used them until I got to the lowest dose available. I quit in August of 2016 and the first month was the roughest. I'm no spring chicken, but after a few weeks, I realized I got a lot of my energy from nicotine.
