Two exchanges that used to have local GBP accounts were mtgox and intersango. Both had their accounts closed (repeatidly in the case of intersango) with no real explanation.
You can easily transfer money to EUR bank accounts using a cheap fx transfer service such as transferwise.com or azimo.com.. so for now that seems like the best way.

yea.. I guess the best option is probably to open your own euro bank account.. I think some of the channel islands banks offer them.

In the UK try  -- it's expensive, but it couldn't really be any faster or easier.. you'll have coins in &lt;10min probably. The SEPA thing is the way to do it though, really.

to be fair, malware mining isn't bad for the currency.. infact it's probably some of the most resilient and censorship resistant mining you could wish for. With ASICs, mining is set to become pretty centralized.. the handling of the recent fork (and ability to fix it) showed that the majority of the hashing power is controlled by at most a douzen individuals (the pool operators)-  this isn't very distributed.. at all. The govt could easilly corrupt or get rid of all of these people.

There are a bunch of ways to buy depending on what country you're in.. you can use paypal on the virwox.com exchange.. first buy SLL and then exchange those for BTC. bitfloor.com has cash deposits at a bank if you're in the US. 
In europe, SEPA bank transfers allow free payments from anywhere in the EU into the EUR bank accounts of bitstamp.net or bitcoin-24.com (and other exchanges).. If you're not in europe, there are many foreign exchange companies that can cheaply perform a SEPA transfer while taking the funding from you in the form of a local bank transfer.. services like  azimo.com, transferwise.com etc.. there are loads of them.. find one near you and use it to exchange your money into a euro sepa transfer to one of the bitcoin exchanges with a euro account.. this is pretty much always cheaper than a wire transfer.

That is true, however all centralization is bad.. ASICs are probably always going to be more centralized than general purpose CPUs.

you could sell them on bitbargain.co.uk.

are you sure about that? I don't see why it wouldn't work in reverse too -- but to be fair the withdrawing isn't so much of a problem anyway since the exchanges don't charge such ridiculous fees for wire transfers.

You can just send directly from your online banking to EUR accounts, but your bank will charge ~£5-£10 - plus maybe 3% on the GBP to EUR foreign exchange.. with transferwise the fee is £1 (for up to £300) and &lt;1% for the fx.. considering there are no trading fees on bitcoin-24 this works out pretty cheap. bitcoin-24 takes a couple of days to receive the money.. bitstamp is faster.. usually within 24hrs.

litecoin isn't much better in that regard.. the system would be much more robust if everyone could solo-mine.
However litecoin has more blocks so in theory that could support a larger number of pools. With bitcoin there are only 144 blocks per day.. rougly half of that is mined by identified pools.. if they were equal they could find aroudn 6 blocks each per day.. of course they aren't equal - some of the smaller ones may not even be earning 1 block on some days.
