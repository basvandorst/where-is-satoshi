BTC, obviously, but also IOTA fits the definition perfectly

That was the stat from The Economist and I reported it as it was.

It's just an opportunity to keep accumulating. I'm just bothered by coinbase fees tbh but then when I think to the long term view I'm like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thanks for your point 3! That's really something to focus on. About point 2, I agree on a direct attack to the nodes but would a 51% attack be so easily detected by the full nodes owners if, let's say, the double-spending doesn't affect them? I understand that energy is particularly cheap in China, and I'm a convinced btc hodler, yet I would feel more tranquil with knowing that pools under such a corrupt government (known for its interferences into the private sector) are a minority.
Add: I'm reading that under Stratum V1 a mining pool operator could, if they wanted to, decide to censor certain transactions, or block certain protocol upgrades. Such an update seems more than necessary.

Thanks for the highlights! I'm thinking of Bitcoin as a solution to African monetary and political issues. A way for several third world countries to shelter from the hyperinflation of their corrupt systems (see Zimbabwe, between the many). Internet will reach them, so will bitcoin.
