yep, it seems to be contaminated with segwit

would seem ideal for university students where fan noise may be a problem...
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:51:44
in that case Bitcoin is kind of redundant - banking systems do that already
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:47:46
about -1,500 or whatever it costs now...
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:36:29
cheap bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:42:38
don't be stupid, just write it down
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:19:29
well how can they go bankrupt when the taxpayers are always the "lenders of last resort"??
@_date: 2017-01-22 18:31:00
Satoshi is believed to have been Hal Finney why CSW wanted to tear apart his widows house
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:17:55
in the same sense that central bank issued currency is a pyramid scheme nearing collapse...
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:04:03
great minds think alike, but fools seldom differ...
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:36:41
pooling ruined the dream of magic internet money you got for being online too
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:55:51
been there, done that with a 2009 laptop - moved to new machine but forgot the real wallet.dat is in hidden Local Settings/appdata folders along with documents and photos...
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:35:06
most sales "fail" when Bitcoin is going up, or there is some "system problem" that lasts until the price collapses
there are no "honest mistakes" when it comes to money...
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:07:40
all those half-wits desperately trying to grow their share of the network
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:02:14
the bag holders from 2013 are selling out
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:45:26
probably one and the same person - why would you send the first transaction to someone else?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:53:49
let's not, that would hand control to the banksters and fractional reserve Bitcoin.  of course being able to issue bitcoin without having to buy they would be wonderful for coinbase and other sellers
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:38:13
make sure you hold them in your own wallet application and not on an exchange or the site you bought them.  with the price this high the risk of an exchange claiming hack or loss is too great a temptation...
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:52:14
they certainly do have more failed/cancelled transactions/technical difficulties during price movements - and since it's almost always in their favour it can't be just "coincidence"
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:18:03
wait for the 100% correction now the ETF isn't coming anytime soon!
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:14:53
everyone seems to understand what they are about now...  which is why the price is rapidly plunging toward zero
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:15:29
we lay off "Nigerian prince"'s when they quit sending emails every day - they're certainly getting rich on the 0.01% that fall for it
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:01:13
why would they approve a field day for scammers - the stockmarket is bad enough
@_date: 2016-11-12 02:26:56
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:42:20
so are HSBC but no one closes them down because of the damage it would cause to the wider economy...
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:20:35
just like paypal, there is no limit how long they can withold funds or service
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:44:40
compression would only make blockchain difficult to share if they had to download the whole thing and subject to data loss and corruption - not worth the trouble considering cheap bandwidth and storage costs
@_date: 2017-01-30 12:31:39
blockchain is a bit like using punch paper tape when the rest of the world has hard drives
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:04:53
how quaint...  but bollockscheme/core/half-wit's sole purpose is to kill off bitcoin for the banksters
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:04:27
it will activate on a dead chain
@_date: 2016-11-25 13:04:10
in any population there will be a certain number of halfwits who vote for slavery - hello Hillary!
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:58:58
they'll just ban Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-11-11 13:46:49
they talk about themselves - bollockscheme want to destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-21 17:47:31
rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic doesn't make it bigger
@_date: 2016-11-30 00:49:20

"If voting made any difference, why would they let you do it?"  Mark Twain
@_date: 2017-01-29 17:03:58
perhaps someone should combine bitcoin nodes with regular linux mail transfer agents - postfix, qmail, etc...?
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:00:32
don't use crap phones...
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:01:02
and the scam resumes
@_date: 2016-11-06 01:29:34
no, don't tell everyone, that's next week...
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:29:23
the half-wits are no-brainers
@_date: 2016-11-08 14:06:51
it would be determined if the old coins move but half-wit is more likely to recycle anything that's not moved for 5 years or more
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:23:55
why bother?
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:19:11
in theory... but it may be possible to find shortcuts
@_date: 2016-11-13 01:34:19
if it doesn't next difficulty 273,659,333,825 (+7.48%) will put most out of the game
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:16:31
soft forks break consensus and impose massive technical debt on the future
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:23:17
could everyone running classic switch to BU for a united front against the half-wits
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:28:51
failed scheme to rip-off bitcoin owners
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:13:55
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:55:05
time to get, while the getting is still good, buddy.
@_date: 2016-11-24 01:59:07
there is no reason they can't activate large blocks immediately - other miners will soon catch up...
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:08:16
the banksters have taken over
@_date: 2016-11-21 21:37:14
what could be better than allowing the half-wits to replace one arbitrary block size limit with another...
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:21:13
don't trust
@_date: 2016-12-04 02:21:30
or after...
@_date: 2016-11-03 12:48:18
they could always hardcode them to a different address if they get short of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:00:01
Black Friday sale!  BUY!!
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:39:26
most Bitcoin services and exchanges claim hack, downtime or scheduled maintenance when the price is moving to maximise their profits
@_date: 2016-11-16 22:02:59
nevermind...  unless CSW moves the early coins he is assumed to be 100% conman
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:52:31
bitcoin etf would be scammers charter - and banksters don't need encouraging
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:29:10
same as the real world when it'/s leaders get corrupted by brown envelopes stuffed with cash
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:23:53
so if someone "finds" the keys to your house and steals it's contents, it's OK??
@_date: 2016-12-24 06:22:39
you trust google??
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:14:16
lose more than that in fees with the network congestion 
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:33:32
many a true thing spoken...
@_date: 2016-09-13 12:37:54
until Bitcoin is better or easier to use than say Apple Pay it has no future
@_date: 2016-09-13 20:28:20
too slow
@_date: 2016-09-30 21:16:27
Basically, No.  Bitcoin has reached it's endgame with half-wits taking over.  
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:55:30
their only real concern is that authy and SMS costs them a fantastic amount of money to use - I doubt they are really concerned about SMS diversion...
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:59:29
the elite are so afraid they have manipulated the price of gold to stop money leaving their system
@_date: 2016-10-08 20:22:13
it does not - it just creates a longterm support nightmare and very little scaling
@_date: 2016-10-20 17:16:47
well no, it is pure scam
@_date: 2016-10-12 22:37:58
in the same sense that the US Federal reserve run a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2016-10-03 00:55:13
just preparing for the 30% haircut over the bank holiday.  Grab your cash while you still can...
@_date: 2016-10-06 19:15:49
there is no crypto anything behind onecoin - it's pure scam!
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:28:53
unless of course it's WWIII and there's a catastrophic loss of technology then gold is your only option
@_date: 2016-10-06 13:40:36
well, I wouldn't trust Kraken either - frequent log in issues and unexpected password changes
@_date: 2016-10-09 21:41:30
but it will give regulators and excuse to ban all cryptocurrency real or imaginary
