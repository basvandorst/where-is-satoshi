Bitfury has a space heater-ish prototype, Avalon have a coffee warmer ish prototype. I believe heating type of miners will not be mass produced  until we get to lower processor nodes: sub-28nm

is it? look at the volume of attention we get vs the attention these dark wallet and mixers. anonymity is not the problem here, this aspect of bitcoin has never been broken down like you suggested. If you are a company that deal purely in bitcoin and/or other currencies thats not the US dollar or operate in the US, coinvalidation does not apply to you.
open bazaar doesn't improve anonymity whatsoever.

centralization of mining pools are not a technical problem, its a people problem
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:49:35
You can't get work done while under constant attention, I was never really active on social media anyways.
Since people refused to read the PDF on coinvalidation's site and is asking for rationale personally, I'll explicate a bit.
Everyone's fear of "tracking" coins is unnecessary, there are already working implantation of anonymity such as CoinJoin to eliminate what seems like the biggest concern with coinvalidation. people tend to fear what they don't understand. In this case it is not the 


 


(which is what I thought the community attitude would have been initially, but alas I was wrong.)
Story time! the purpose of coinvalidation was made for bitcoin business to get US bank accounts, both the idea and the code is quiet old (2012). If people truly have memory like elephants as you suggested, then I need not to remind you how many bitcoin business had their bank account shutdown in 2012/2013 which prompt these business to move overseas or shutdown completely.
Unlike others, Alex and I had no plans to move out of US to do bitcoin business, as our family and friends resides here in the states. We then took action to open dialogues down at DC with various fiat regulators to find out how can we comply with US law.
Regardless my personal views on government regulation, I believe if you are going to play the US game, you'd have to play by US rules. What they wanted was AML/KYC for bitcoin, a proof of ownership if you will. To see where *their fiat* has gone. We wrapped all of this in a API and coinvalidation was born.
Even today, we get inquires from people who wish to start an US bitcoin business and needs banking, coinvalidation offers a simple checklist on things you should do/have to operate legally in the US. 
Their rules, not ours. this is not an isolated incident. [Here's coinbase running into the same regulator pressure the other day.](
I found it extremely amusing when people tracking the mtgox coins on this subreddit with furor. It's ok to track other people's coins but not your own right? I thought bitcoin was suppose to be fungible. ;)
As for Avalon, the chip incident was a operation clusterfuck, it was difficult to work out a global supply chain in such a short notice with our inexperience at the time, and we failed miserably. In addition, failure to provide a timely update (lack of communication is a personal issue that I am working on as a introvert.) caused many rumors spread, but blockchain holds the truth. We gave chip customers **full refunds in bitcoins** ( at great loss on our end. ) which in my opinion was and still is a lot better than all the other ASIC companies when it comes to refunds.

the company pointed them out is using A1 chips, the unamed company is not using A1 chips, it is believed to be KNC as the chip spec match but this is speculative.
GCHQ is the uk version of the NSA.
asicminer sold that batch of chips more than 4 months ago, they will come online gradually from various sources.
the major players in the market in term of size is bitfury, knc, asicminer/antminer the last two has more teams using them to build farms rather than themselves unlike the former two.
Avalon as stated last year in the conference is taking a backseat position while advancing processor technology while the market develops, that has not changed as we continue to monitor the mining industry.
also he is incorrect in terms that no company is moving forward, Avalon and another company is looking into 16/20nm.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:44:36
"harder" is not the right word here, it is simply not worth the investment, avalon had litecoin asic design back in early 2013, there are also some people making X11 asics design at the moment.
people should not be comparing asics with CPUs since they are the same thing on a technology level, you can always make an asic, true to its name sake, they are called application specific for a reason
@_date: 2014-07-11 06:46:27
Which specifics are you wondering about? I think I stated pretty clearly on the fact US want the customer to claim ownership for the bitcoin address directly interacting with fiat dollars and assuming all legal responsibility that comes with it in the future, whatever they maybe (so I do not have all the specifics and this has nothing to do with side stepping any questions.). I believe they are trying to have tie together the point where fiat disappears and bitcoin begins.
In the forbes article, while it was mostly interpreted wrongly, it was not entirely inaccurate. Bitcoin is anonymous ( the network does not ask for any identification besides private key. ), Bitcoin is not private, the public ledge *currently* allows people to track spendings. I'm sure others, such as palantir, google and various unknown agencies and even start ups are tackling this 180 million address data analysis problem. The community however responded by burrowing their head in the sand yelling at us instead of supporting and advocating features that support more anonymity of Bitcoin.

spin is strong with this one, we sold a total of few hundred fpgas to 100 to 200 people, the discount was not steep it was &lt;20%, and we send units out to those who send in the trade-ins, which was 43 people if i recall correctly, totaling under 150 FPGAs. Granted those people did not fair very well, no one in mining really did, delayed compounded and everything was late, its just some people made more money than others.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:14:23
I explained this in the thread, the controllers are preburned, did we built other protypes between batch 1 and 2? we did of course. a controller probably got mixed up in the bin. some math were done on the thread, the 700 coin was generated from less than one week (assuming we were mining with just ONE of the units we were suppise to "ship", again proof is in the blockchain, you can calculate how much bitcoin can be generated based on the difficulty at the time.) the units themselves was not mining we ship as we built them, china is just really dirty, granted if people never been there, this sounds like bull.
I believe time will tell, because truth always comes out.
p.s. there is no further "evidence", this was the only incident.

not exactly, developers simply talk to other developers, and a general respect is shown on unannounced projects and services. In this instant I do not know the exact project they are referring to, but as I said before, there are many exciting projects, in my opinion anyway that is going to come out in September, it doesn't even matter which one of those is the one in question. Be glad there is movement in the Bitcoin world.

This is more of a publicity stunt anyways, we probably wouldn't even put up 60Gh/s on the network, and it won't be on for more than a few blocks, I'm simply going to video record it, take some screen shots and shut it off, I feel this is very fair. this is comparable to showing off our new "car" on the drag stripe.

negative on Avalon, all the coins are still present.
@_date: 2012-01-08 08:18:12
the first and foremost anyone should do is to see if there's people willing to trade Bitcoins locally within your area.
@_date: 2012-10-03 17:22:42
No they are not. the money will be sit in the account until a direct transfer to SMIC for production.

No I did not.
I used a $.1 per Kilowatt constant using the **exact** formula I described.
at current price the return is actually 116 days. you must be using a different formula.
no to mention I even used 600W in my estimate, and that is very conservative where a realistic number will be much lower than this.

no digital storage is best storage. note: this is intended for long term cold storage, but can work for "saving" type of accounts as well.
* download electrum at 
* generate new seed, and remember your mnemonic code and GAP (GAP is important also).

I too suggest waitting for the network, but if you can not wait, and trust your skills.
 
I suggest exporting the wallet.dat so you can find the privatekey of the transactions you wish to send, then use a wallet with key importing option, send the transaction from there, wait for that to confirm, then run -rescan on your old wallet, and it'll show up as per usual.

the December demo is the publicity stunt and not this AMA.
the Demo is simply to prove to people that the chip is real and functioning. I don't see what your problem is beside the ideological concept that ASIC companies can't mine period, no matter what Gh/s. I already explained to you, less than 60GH/s will be turned on for an hour or so to produce some evidence and thats it. If you are not satisfied with that then I guess nothing I say will change that. regardless, this Demo will happen.


You have no idea what you are talking about. I will attempt to enlighten you. we will be testing the chips ability for what they are designed to do, that is compute double-SHA-256, this isn't even bitcoin exclusive. to use test-net-in-a-box is simply silly. It may be in your favor to refrain from speaking about things with such prejudice in the future.
@_date: 2012-10-04 18:06:56
Let me take the high road since you are making awful a lot of assumptions.
1. the sample batch of chips are not produced with our customers money.
2. I know well why the testnet exists, testing on it is just as useless. we have our own software and methods for our "smoking day" chip testing, it does not involve bitcoin's mainnet, or testnet.
3. I believe the class will benefit you more than I.

@_date: 2012-02-09 00:12:38
this is correct. I'm am 100% positive.
the only way to "launder" properly is by mixing e.g. deposit to a exchange like mtgox then withdraw your money to another address, and you've effectively laundered money because "your" bitcoins that you withdraw isn't linked to the address from which you deposited.

I'm going to ignore your comment and say this.
you look like you are not familiar with the whole game jam/game competition scene in indie gaming, and I apologize for assuming that since my announcement was clearly not addressed to them but to the Bitcoin community.
fact of the matter is, there are many many Jams yearly, where people spend 48 hours to 10 days of their time making a game, for no real purpose other than to make games. this is simply a variation of this with prize money if you read the reason that inspired this was the fact indie game developers needs to pay rent too ( in an earlier status update )
now for your questions,
* You always announce a competition before it happens, and often months in advance so people can free up their time for something like this, and mostly they reveal information such as when it is, and how long it is going to take, engage interest and other stuff and in this case, tell them there’s also prize involved in it.
* It’s for game developers.
* Of course.
* That is subjective.

It states clearly the unit is stand-alone, does not require a host computer.
and it comes with linux so you are welcome to run the miner of your choice, and if you read further, it also states we will be releasing the iso image of the system a month before the hardware is release so other people can work on it.

such system in my opinion is never suppose to replace the internet as we know it, but it does offer alternative options, which is what I like.
My problem with hocnet and a lot of meshnet project is there is a huge amount of "talk" involved, and looking at your to-do list there's a bunch of research tasks; while I understand that doing things the "right way" is important. this is a learning process and experience. I suggest coming up with a bare minimum node box and go from there.

actually, there's now 3 canceled orders if you see the site ( 3 is in stock ), I'm still processing the rest of the orders, and once I have a solid idea how many order is actually present I'll open up for people to order the ones that have been canceled.
of course, there will be an newsletter preceding this.
@_date: 2012-10-03 19:28:00
I will not be able to give an satisfactory answer at this moment as I do not have the tech papers on hand, but within this month of October information related to these aspects will come out.
@_date: 2012-11-28 08:18:54
I am not going to be fair with their poor business estimations, Have we have delays? Yes, many times internally things have not gone as planned, but this is also exactly why we announced the original shipping date at Feb, 2013, and now have moved up to mid-Jan after eliminating potential and actual problems.
I am very tired of defending Avalon due to the lackluster performance of our competition. such as the statement made by stf.
@_date: 2012-10-08 19:25:40
oh don't worry about that, that's the group who wrote the timeline.js library, I'm just linking to a preview page. the final version will be on avalon-asic.com

open source itself will solve this problem, since in usual open source projects the most supported way of doing something wins, e.g. the branch that gets more development ultimately becomes the main branch; except in bitcoins case since it's a p2p system, fragmentation becomes an issue, weather amir is the editor or not makes little difference and if a large amount of people/developers agree something is to be added to bitcoin, it also matters not if it's a BIP or not e.g.  it is merely a format which people write proposals.
BitSyncom will write an article about this soon as well, but addressing the BIP and voting method as a whole rather than focusing on 16 vs 17.
@_date: 2012-10-03 16:08:00
I view them as a major competitor, all FUD and other uncertainties aside here's what I think
* It is completely possible for them to produce the specs they are advertising from a technical standpoint.
* I view their shipping delay as a major underestimation as they simply took too many orders and is currently overwhelmed. This hurt their PR very much as when it comes to ASICS, timing is **everything.** 
* Where we only release 300 with a very confident promise on delivery date.
* They have responded to our 60gh/s by bumping their specs. I believe competition is good for the customers, but now let's see if they can keep up. Avalon have more things we've yet to release.
@_date: 2012-10-03 16:11:05
ngzhang and I both has good track records, but for you to believe us or not is solely up to you.
@_date: 2012-04-18 21:25:41
location? I often find is much easier to do this in-person than going through some form of exchange.
@_date: 2012-02-15 10:31:39
I think they are different things. The real underlining goal to local exchanges is to promote and build local Bitcoin economy, increase users and usability via positive feedback cycle.
also by addressing this locally and physically, it completely eliminate one of the biggest problem when it comes to exchanges and other Bitcoin related business. Trust. which there is no known solution (not counting work arounds such as web of trust or current  systems as they can always be gamed.)
I do however support your project, and if you do some how figure out a way to deal with p2p trust over the Internet which is a big big problem that not only limited to Bitcoins. I'd say you should have a Nobel prize for that.

@_date: 2012-03-03 13:21:28
it's removed because it's not suppose to be a Wallet feature in the first place, the Bitcoin client will undergo refactoring in the future to ensure it's flexibility. e.g. I'm fairly sure not long now we will see nodes that only propagate transactions and check for any double spends.
@_date: 2012-06-20 22:29:12
theft: very low risk if you buy it, and put it on a offline wallet since you are using it for long term investment anyways.
volatility is subjective, but it'll always be present, however the current trend is bull.
I'd say yes.
@_date: 2012-05-25 21:13:50
more info on this? I'd love to add it to [Bitcoin Navigator](
@_date: 2012-02-28 08:04:28
this is pretty false, with proper set up, a individual/merchant can accept 0 confirmation tx without too much risk at all. as the window for attack is very low (few seconds) and the effort required is vast(large amount of cancer node is required, in addition knowing the ip address of the target, and having connection to pool.). I'll be releasing an article soon on how exactly to attempt an 0-confirmation attack, and how hard it is **really** to pull off.
@_date: 2012-10-05 17:51:20
I really don't think they will ship that many more units, for the difficulty to increase another 10 times, meaning if we are at ~25TH, and 10 times of that is 250TH/s which is pretty reasonable, but to increase by *another* 10 times, e.g. reaching 2500TH/s is a long shot, considering BFL and bASIC would have to produce about 2000TH/s within that 4 month period. I do not believe the growth will be that high.

if you are serious about this, PM me as I make ASIC dedicated to bitcoin mining
@_date: 2012-10-03 18:31:33
without giving out too much, it is in the 6 digits in USD.
@_date: 2012-01-29 14:10:00
have you checked your local area for bitcoin traders? if you are in NYC I'd happy to do some local trades.
@_date: 2012-08-12 08:49:36
I no longer have a full rig laying around, but however I do have a bunch of video cards laying around if you are still interested.
@_date: 2012-10-04 14:20:26
using those estimates the hardware break even is 120 days, not to mention assuming everyone else ships their ASICs on time.
@_date: 2012-01-25 23:56:59
run a RPC front-end at work and have bitcoind at home? maybe I'm assuming too much in your technical understanding; but this would be the best approach imo.
@_date: 2012-10-03 16:50:32
I wouldn't get your hopes up, however it is entirely possible that some people will not pay and cancel orders ( we had a small number of those ) and those will be opened for order, sign up at our newsletter as we will inform people when these are available.
However, if demand is great and warrants for another batch, we will think about it, but do take note.
 **note:** this said batch will *not ship* until the first 300 are finished, so you are looking at earliest mid-feb to march of 2013, so please think about this carefully because timing is above all else in the bitcoin mining world.
@_date: 2011-10-24 03:59:09
I think it's going to be an rather public event, and I'm fairly sure most if not all the tools are/will be provided for me e.g. projector.

Thanks, I've seen that one already though, also I am hoping to make this more interactive than just a ppt
@_date: 2011-11-27 22:17:21
Sure, I mean there's a bunch of ways to do this, you can have some internal third party system to keep track, or use satoshi code in the transactions themselves to account for each transaction, both will work.

bypassing the 16 people per Etherpad limit, and some notes.
feel free to ask questions regarding the session.

Just finished an update on the site, now each venue have their own specific icon showing their service, added a bunch of new locations in europe.
todo list:
obtain store location in Denver, CO.
finish writing/editing article on the Bitcoin Session from Open Video Conference.
other secret projects ;)
@_date: 2011-09-30 21:23:34
the project was form together tuesday afternoon, by wednesday early morning we have just decided on the domain, got designs done, last night the psd was converted to the code and  is now up and online, the first 1000 bus cards is already being printed, I'll be talking to the guy regarding shipping. the whole thing will take-off this weekend and initial stage will begin next week monday
As you can see, lots of things have been happening and we are running on a extremely tight schedule.
p.s. seems you been misinformed since this project isn't even public yet, we have just begin working on it in the project dev board.
@_date: 2011-10-24 17:58:36

it's apparently on it's way, shipping is pretty normal for cig imports, 3-4 weeks. the service doesn't offer tracking numbers, so I guess nothing to do but wait.

Heading over there now. will keep you redditors posted.
possible delays due to 9/11 security measures.

I'm fairly certain people who watched this video watched for Gavin and Stefan just like me, but it's silly saying by appearing on his show it's going to have a negative effect on myself, frankly speaking I can care less about that. however if people don't like it. it's time for some body else to take the torch and make other Bitcoin show, and invite the same big name people like Gavin and Stefan that goes onto Bruce's show. I don't see any so far. it's the same reason people use Mtgox to sell their bitcoins, because there's no viable competition out there at the moment.
If anyone **is** serious about running a show and would like big name guests I'll be glad to help you network. 
competition is good in any field, this is something I support. ~~talking~~ complaining on the other hand is cheap.
I appreciate your concern, but I've learned people will always talk shit regardless how right or wrong you are. I can only continue to manage my existing and so far so good track record.
@_date: 2011-09-22 21:51:07
I also second this service, if you are technical, e.g. knows how to use bitcoins and can transfer and sell via mtgox or exchange of your choice
Bitcoin Wallet is a open source, full blown client. e.g.  downloads the block chain based on bitcoinJ.
I used this app handle all my mobile bitcoin transfers, noticably the Bitcoin Conference payments.
feel free to ask me any questions regarding the App, I'm also working on improving the code base as well.
@_date: 2011-09-14 02:35:19

suggested for new law H.R. 1098, which will remove legal tender laws so it would be great for Bitcoin.

Well that's an idea. I'll forward this to a friend who's doing a app-store.

there's a python thin client that's being ported to Android, there's also few existing android clients that works just fine. (luckily so far the blockchain size isn't a issue yet).

Thanks for noticing, it is now fixed!
@_date: 2011-12-22 22:19:54
seems like everyone is keeping this up better than I am.
I'd be happy to answer any questions to those who can't wait for that info site to be up.
@_date: 2011-10-08 07:56:07
there's already works in this department. see
@_date: 2011-09-16 19:12:40
Frankly speaking, I'm am also more interested in what Stefan and Gavin has to say in regards about Bitcoin; Bruce is the show host, regardless of past ordeals people still tell him things, and it's good that you hear about it and make judgement yourself. but blindly saying you have no interested in hearing it sounds like a Conservative saying he doesn't read the New York Times because it's a Liberal news paper.
@_date: 2011-12-19 22:49:20
gonna try it and see what happens, the price is pretty competitive from other online retailers.
@_date: 2011-10-01 22:10:45
there will be a separate mobile version.
@_date: 2011-09-13 05:02:14
Thanks guys, please inform me if any other location accepts bitcoins.
Edit: got in contact with Roger from memorydealers and are now adding japanese places that accepts bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:00:11
so probably 200Ws, great. So exactly what we predicted they'll draw back in Nov if they succeed.

I guess you missed 2 weeks of a stickie in the forum handling this issue via walletbit tickets, but it's been handled as there's no more tickets and now we are sending those that have been manually confirmed.

both sites are legit, wait for an upcoming newsletter for details.

@_date: 2013-03-31 08:55:43
to be honest, competitor or not, I just don't want to help BFL.
also if we want to make money, we would just mine and not sell.
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:23:50
the bill of material list is a huge effort to release
@_date: 2013-06-20 04:54:30
so, you think we dont have any asics thats not customer units? i thought i addressed this pretty directly.
i think i stated we have test units a long time ago publicly, like in April on a vice article.
@_date: 2013-03-18 16:10:03
woocommerce 2.0 now has their own way to handle POST
@_date: 2013-08-24 12:19:07
sigh, indeed. there are zero basis for these numbers, as it stands a 51% attack can be achieved for much **much** less than these projections, I of all people can confirm this.
The real question is what's there to gain from a 51% attack and what the attacker wish to achieve.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:44:58
I have never face palmed so hard.
1. mining will never stop.
2. power consumption will go down.
3. self sustaining "green" energy will be available.
@_date: 2013-01-22 22:07:54
since you don't visit the forum it seems, here you go 
I've released this on the forum shipping thread awhile back.
@_date: 2013-01-26 13:24:35
I'm also under the assumption my competition bASIC wasn't a failure and BFL will actually ship on time. but both of these things failed to happen and the difficulty is no where as high.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:45:22
lol, that's not going to happen, more like we dont want to take back orders, frankly speaking, we can charge whatever, but if we were in it to min max profits, we wouldn't have sold units period.
@_date: 2013-06-20 02:20:35
all the units have been pre configued with that ( since day one, on all the avalons)... as I explained they are batch flashed, and some of them are different, because we go through quick revisions ( see our firmware downloads on the bitcoin wiki.)
we do have test and dev units, both fpgas and asics, and they are how we even build these firmwares in the first place.
again, like I said, we do not do burn-in testing on mainnet.
remind me why this is an issue again?
besides people spreading FUD. people will believe whatever they want, I've accepted that, and frankly cbf to care.
@_date: 2013-01-24 16:47:13
as an somebody in the ASIC business, this is incorrect as there is already methods to make a litecoin ASIC which will pretty much destroy it.
@_date: 2013-08-09 04:05:42
I hope everyone seen the "second page"...
@_date: 2013-06-19 22:37:39
No, see 
@_date: 2013-02-13 16:36:51
according to the source the article came from  I can't seem to find the url though.
there's a decent amount of "dot gov" sites, in china that aren't really "official" so to speak, it isn't like the "dot gov" organizations in other countries,
this one just happens to be a local tax bureau
@_date: 2013-06-20 01:55:07
you are entitled to believe whatever you want, but we are not mining with the customer units, they are not even "units".
maybe in a few months you'll understand, maybe not; it really doesn't matter though.
I, and by extension Avalon, will continue to do what we believe.
@_date: 2013-02-18 05:17:54
I agree. Please do your math properly on this investment as with all things Bitcoin.
fyi I'm Yifu from Avalon.
@_date: 2013-02-18 06:23:18
see forums, they are being sent out as we speak right now.
@_date: 2013-03-02 11:42:11


really now.
@_date: 2013-02-17 13:03:15
great, more reason for me to move  to a higher priority list of todos
@_date: 2013-02-08 21:02:00
If these people can predict the future it would amazing, there's tons of story of people just deleting upwards of few hundred coins in the early days because they were not even worth a dollar.
@_date: 2013-01-20 18:47:26
agreed, and I highly suggest you wait until Mid Feb. the supposed date when BFL will start shipping, plus you can not purchase a unit from Avalon right at this moment, there's no reason for you to cancel.
although personally, I do not expect BFL to meet their mid-feb shipping time either.
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:24:56
agree, also see our open sourced reference design on github
