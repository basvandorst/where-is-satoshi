Amazon is a large enough, respected and trusted enough retailer that they would have the power to stabilize the market. People are not going to panic because it's stabilizing, and people spending bitcoins would not cause the market to crash, it would just cause it to chill the fuck out. If it does that, it's going to encourage people to spend their bitcoins and sell them, but it's not like there isn't going to be people waiting to buy those coins they sell...as more coins are released, more people gain interest in bct.

Oops, forgot to mention that part! Thanks :)

True enough. Here's to hoping someone with the know-how does something like this

Not everyone absolutely requires anonymity, especially for buying things. What? Am I going to get an anonymous PO box set up for the delivery and give them a fake name? Not likely.
If they accept every other currency (some of which are probably not the most stable), why wouldn't they accept another? I agree, the demand isn't as high to use bitcoin, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be accepted. Most people loathe Western Union money transfers and would rather write a cheque than send one, but you still see them being accepted.

That seems a bit low for that card, even just off ketin0's first link, the base hash rates are higher (depending on which gtx460 you have, though...there were about 20 different versions of that card produced). If you have the original vanilla gtx460, it's low, but not incredibly low, so it's probably fine. Your fan might be going mad, but depending on temperatures, it is probably okay (as long as your fan doesn't crap out). 
You have to keep in mind that mining puts HUGE stress on your card. Benchmarking programs rarely ever get my cards spinning up the way mining does. The cards are designed to handle that stress, however, some cards do not dissipate heat well (like mine, which Is why I had to play with settings).
For my cards I just use Catalyst Control Center (the software that came with the video cards, designed for controlling all aspects of video, including xfire and overclocking). Your card may have come with something similar, but I don't use geforce cards so i'm not sure what it would be. Look it up. However, I highly recommend that if you do not know what you're doing, you put in some serious research before playing with overclocking/underclocking/fan control, as when you do that, you CAN destroy your card.
 I recommend the first thing you do is get something like [this]( so you can see what your temperatures are at now, without touching anything. Then, do some searching to find out what common load temperatures are for your card. If you are somewhere around those temps, you're good. Chances are pretty good that you will want to be somewhere in the 70's, however, your card may be a hot one and will run in the 80's. As long as other people are safely running at those temperatures without issue, you should be okay. If you think you are running too hot still, look into underclocking your card a bit and playing with fan speeds until you can get it where you want. That will, of course, affect hash rates, but if it means you can do it safely and without worry, that's probably more important.

Thanks, I think every bit helps.

I would look into [this]( and verify that you don't have that issue. If you're all good, look into overclocking. Your card seems low, but it's not as common a card as some of the other gtx460's, so I'm having a hard time finding hash rate comparisons.

I have heard it mentioned before, but AFAIK nobody is working on one. It would have to be linked in to exchange sites for it to work proper I think (which doesn't work so good for us canadians).

I didn't know that! I thought you needed to have bitcoin running as a server for it to work. I know the earnings accumulate in the pool until you cash out, but I thought bitcoin always had to be running, either in server mode or client mode. You would still need the bitcoin client to send and receive bitcoins, though, wouldn't you? (Assuming that you have a local wallet and not a cloud wallet).

I wrote a beginners guide to mining a couple days ago.
[Here is a link to it](
Good luck.

Most of what we experience on a daily basis are things that, even 10 years ago, people said would never happen. There is no harm in taking 5 minutes out of my day to put forward a suggestion of a feature I would like to see on a website I frequent often.
