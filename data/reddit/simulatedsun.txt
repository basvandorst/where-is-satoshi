Heroin addiction is off the charts as a result of prescription opioid addiction, and the subsequent crack down on prescription abuse.

Incredibly naive in my opinion.  There is a reason why Facebook is a multibillion dollar business.  I however do agree that there is very little coinauth could actually do, way too many ways to very easily subvert it.

Don't sell, but make sure you use some. Or at least designate some to hold (savings) and some to use.

Price correction. Correct some more, ill buy another 250 mBTC tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:35:53
Price also stayed flat around $420 a week and a half ago after flying up from the 200s. Flash to nearly $1000 and back down,  Now we've gone up to the 800s. So.. next step $2000 followed by a drop and gradual increase to 1700? You tell me.  
Honestly its been like 3 days, we are so used to the crazy rapid growth, we get spoiled. I just take stagnation as a good time to purchase some more mBTC before we go up again. I bought 250 mBTC the other night when it swung down to $ 760/BTC
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:28:31
Lower the better for a few days... Just gotta hold off till Thursday before the price rockets again.

It is **extremely** easy to get 3rd party consent, especially from Joe Public. 
Coinvalidation might not exactly be about selling information. Let's think of it as wallet validation, and associating a person with a white-listed wallet. Now we have some information that could be profitable to the right people. Again, I'm not saying that's what coinvalidation is, I'm saying what something like it could, potentially, lead to. 
  
  Totally disregarding that, it is pretty easy to create *regulatory* incentive for businesses in the U.S.  I don't think this would actually harm bitcoin that much, just leave the U.S. very far behind in a growing global economy. 
I do agree that it won't take off, I think there are way too many ways to circumvent it and without circlejerking too much, the bitcoin community is on average relatively smart.

I hope we're on the top of a temporary bubble.
  
  I want to buy some cheap. :)
  
  In the future, when we talk about the natural deflation of our currency, the kids will all be amazed that one day people made two bitcoins a week. That's more than their parents made last year.

So let's all get some coke and sharp suits.  Someone throw a giant phone to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:51:13
That is good though... Houses are way over priced. Joe house flipper gets burned, but its good for people who want to purchase a home to live in. Of course this ignores the terrible interest manipulations that ensure you get screwed either way.

People who post this graph are as dim witted as those who blindly believe bitcoin is going to be worth a million dollars a coin In 5 years.
Yes, let me share with you my newfound information I found while googling.

And probably an extra $100,000 in labor costs, bare minimum, until the process was streamlined. Long term efficiency would bring in savings though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:13:53
Eh, I'm not so sure. I think going to satoshis is going too far. It may make btc look worthless to some people.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:18:36
Coinauth is a desperate attempt to maintain status quo and keep money in the hands of only those who have it now. Let's not be fooled into thinking the established power structure will go gently.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:28:58
Well put. Bitcoin has value because of quick transfers around the world, person to person.  It's deflationary aspects *protect* that value.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:25:43
One hundred billion dollars
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:06:24
56% of people have never heard of a bitcoin, most likely. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:32:49
I agree with your overall point, I think.  Coinvalidation really frustrates me, but I don't really think it's something that's going to come to fruition. 
  
  My belief is that the one good thing the last day or two has done has made everyone stop for a minute and think. The overwhelming response has been so far against coinvalidation.  I think this point: 


Is something very important for people to remember. 
**However**, there is almost no such thing as a good debate with the Senate.  It's  mostly political, pandering, bullshit. 
  I wouldn't be so quick to place my trust with the foundation. There are a lot of people who want to make a lot of money from bitcoin, but unlike the community in general it's through screwing people over. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:25:41
I don't think it is, and I would be surprised to see someone have the capacity to manipulate the market that much. Just thinking out loud. In reality this is one of the many ups and downs. 2 weeks ago we went from 900+ to 450 in a little over a day.
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:02:19
I think bitcoin could easily lose temporary value over the next few months, but not guaranteed. I still believe that we're still in the very early stages of adoption.
   Bitcoin is not ready for Joe Investor yet, which is actually a good thing for people who want to get good value now. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:33:59
 As long as my already purchased from last week still come through by Wednesday at the market rate I paid for them. If not ill go ballistic
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:45:38
I'm all for it. Doubling in one day was a little too much. I'm a greedy person and want to purchase more before we hit 1000$ for real.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:53:15
Tax evasion (well, much of it legalized tax loopholes.. I guess I should say tax avoidance) play a huge part in almost any sized business legal efforts. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:51:37
Except you aren't liable for charges someone racked up with your stolen cc info.  You will be refunded. No way to ever get your bitcoins back.
That said, I've had my number stolen and it is always at a very inconvenient time to have my card frozen.
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:14:22
Hopefully the price drops. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:13:21
I saw this at a glance and thought it said 'all' verify..  "Damn, this guy means business.. "
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:19:20
If I were trying to harm bitcoin, I would do my best to push prices down and get people to panic sell right after bitcoin black Friday, to force merchants into loss and make them skiddish about continuing to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:13:02
Well, the money already left my account early today and my coinbase account still shows pending *in the amount if btc I purchased*, so I would be surprised for coinbase not to honor it.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:03:59
I love money?
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:23:00
I get some disposable income to buy, lol
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:43:33
It's Typical guilty until innocent garbage. I shouldn't have to constantly prove that my legit (not counterfeitable) money is valid. Am I using it for an illegal purpose? No? Then stay away from my money. I don't think coinauth will work out, but it would destroy bitcoin value.
Remember, who decides what makes a clean coin clean, the us government? We all know they never abuse power. Coinauth takes control back away from the populous and back to those in power (or those who want to have power). The huge backlash indicates that they underestimated the  community.
