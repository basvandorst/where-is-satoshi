I started with £50 as well, been building it up since then.
The only mistake I made was "diversifying" some BTC into alts and BCH - big mistake. Now I'm 100% BTC + hodl.

I would love to believe this is true, but I don't see any evidence. Bitcoin hasn't stopped monetary expansion in the US, EU or Japan... or in Venezuela for that matter.

Why would one of the world's foremost cryptography experts set up a website with no SSL/TLS certificate?

I guess it would depend on which country you were operating in and whether it was being run as a business or a one off transaction.

I would also expand the term "war spending" to include spending on heavily armed paramilitary police forces, in particular in the USA. 
If this spending on paramilitary police improved the safety of citizens I would be all for it, but it would appear it primarily benefits the corporations who sell the weapons and equipment to such "police" forces.

Arguments that Bitcoin 'wastes' energy rely on a socialist value judgement about how energy 'should' be used.
If a private individual or corporation has purchased energy, then they are free to use that energy for any lawful purpose they choose, whether that is Bitcoin mining, Christmas lights, powering hospitals or anything else.

I wonder if that's the real reason China is considering sending troops into Hong Kong: it wants to tighten its grip on HK because it views it as a way for wealthy Chinese to get money out of China.

Yes. The freedom of an unregulated financial market means that some people will be scammed into buying alt coins. That's part of the price of freedom, and also underlines the need for personal responsibility in doing one's own research.
Unfortunately the nanny state of regulated financial markets has had the unintended consequence of making people believe  there will always be a 'regulator' or government to protect them from their own poor financial decisions.

The UK state pension scheme is unfunded, meaning that pension payments are funded on an ongoing basis by taxpayers via National Insurance contributions. 
This model is known by financial professionals as a Ponzi scheme.

Bitcoin ATMs in Europe require KYC, so I'm wondering if that might be an issue for a Chinese citizen to purchase Bitcoin this way?
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:05:00
Agreed. Perhaps we should reserve the term "private" for things like Facebook' Libra.

I would guess that after purchasing the ATM, paying rent,  paying for security to add/remove cash from ATM, and compliance costs the ATM owner would need that buy-sell spread to make a decent return.

All criticisms about Bitcoin mining consuming too much electricity can be reduced to socialist notions about how electricity (or any resource) 'should' be deployed.
If electricity has been purchased on the open market (or lawfully extracted from natural resources e.g. geothermal energy), then the owner of said electricity can use it for any lawful purpose they see fit, without having to justify their usage.

Who exactly should decide what is 'useless stuff consuming energy'?
People are free to use the electricity they have purchased to consume Twitter or any other social network. Also, Twitter is free to purchase electricity to power the Twitter data centers and bandwidth.
In the same way, Bitcoin miners are free to choose to use electricity they have purchased or otherwise acquired for Bitcoin mining. 
Let's all stop with the value judgements about what is a proper use for electricity.
@_date: 2019-09-15 16:57:37
I believe that if we try to 'win the argument on every level' as you put it, then we have to go on the defensive by trying to excuse BTC mining's energy use, by saying things like 'miners use renewable energy' or 'miners will get more efficient over time'. 
Instead we should make no apologies and say to the central planners: we purchased this electricity, so we're free to use it as we see fit, and if you don't like it, go f\*ck yourself.
We have nothing to be ashamed of as Bitcoiners - indeed Bitcoin is a force for social good and we won't apologise to fiat central planners, or fall for their false arguments about electricity usage.
