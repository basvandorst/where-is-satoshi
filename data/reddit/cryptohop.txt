1k. Lol. Those were the days.

Because that's how much people don't want to cash out to USD.  They are willing to risk everything in a scam not to feed  .gov. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:25:58
also kraken fuck ups..
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:24:49
Lol.

If we all took this advice yesterday. There would have been no dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:16:47
Exactly why I don't own btc or Bch.  Fuck these guys. Especially coinbase.

I had this same question on Friday. I finally stopped being lazy and hit the IRS website and read up on capital gains. Just google short and long term cap gains tax so you have a basic understanding of what you'll owe and how it works. .  Then go to an account when you've converted to fiat. .

If you live in SF you can walk in just about any random office building and find avocado toast. Just follow someone in.

Goddamn right you will you Hoodrich motherfucker. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:32:19
Lol. That's not what happened.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:03:13
Ltc &gt; Btc  
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:49:32
Isn't this what atomic swaps will offer?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:01:52
Btc was 1000 in February.  The fact you said less than 6500 makes me feel like you're full of shit. Lol. But I hope you're honest and actually sold. Good on you. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:42:25
Long term now equals 12 hours.  Got it. Bahahhaha.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:41
Hahaha.  Y'all cracking me up today.  I'm holding to zero if I have to.  House money baby.

Blockfolio or crypto pro is my go to for tracking portfolio.. I don't keep my coin on exchanges tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:25:15
slow.. expensive.  outdated.  It will never be more than store of value. 
its betamax. The VHS will eventually come and then the dvd player. Blockchain is here to stay.. BTC... eh not a btcliever.  
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:47:57
I prefer it the way it is. Great for scalping. 
What I don’t like is that all the alts are paired to it. 
When it drops so goes the market.

girl in pink got a golden shower.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:50:43
What are you taking profits into? Fiat? 
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:14:42
This is just the bots being bots.  Im long with a SL right under the next fib.  I think a lot of people are and if those SL's get triggered I think you all are correct. Big drop.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:20:28
I think this is 1 reason for ltc slow rise.  Newbies coming into the coinbase gateway to purchase bitcoin. Freaking at the price and instead buying a discounted version of btc. Once they learn more they ended up buying into btc anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:25:08
He's going to be set at a 5000 limit on coinbase.  He's asking where he can buy a large amount. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:47:38
If you want excitement, there are plenty of alts for that.

My girl has been investing as long as me.  She just not as risky.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:09:36
Yeah... but that's not what they do. What they do is create jobs for average people, who in turn pay extremely high tax rates.  The end game the pot is bigger if they let Apple Pay less taxes and they tax the employees. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:10:45
Paradise papers.   Not like we didn't know but when you see the scale is pretty astonishing. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:47:12
Hope that's a lab-grown.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:22:25
Comey has to take the majority of fault in that.  Plus, No one asked Clinton to prop up Trump and then shit on a candidate from her own party.  She was power drunk.

Its important people see this so they don't share this same sentiment.

Regulate it and the price fluctuation it will stabilize some. Back it by the worlds largest military and see what happens. Until then enjoy the roller coaster.

Everyone is bullish on crypto long term. But the bots gonna bot.

i just logged into Binance. all is normal
@_date: 2018-11-15 01:50:08
$5590 on coinbase.  Pretty good support right down below this. All kinds of sell
Pressure right above. This thing has no where to go but down for now. I’d check back in 2 years. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:22:03
No. I'm saying it's all a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:37:27
Stock market has been on a 7 year bull run.  It had a correction the week. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:09:42
This. I had an idea to sell at an all time high and all the dudes who got me into crypto (and all bought ethereum for under $10) told me not to sell.  I looked at them as vets and trusted the opinion. yeah it may go up again and they will look smarter than me, but my gut told me to sell and double my position.  I ignored it.  I was asking a lot of questions about taxation because I was weighing 32% tax versus 32% correction.  At this point the tax would have been better because I lost 34% of my total portfolio vs 32% of just my profits. I'm still up 4x after this correction. But 10x was a lot better.

Investing in any company is gambling. Hey could go bankrupt and owe nothing. So what's the point? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:50:49
Lol. This is bottom? Let's hope
