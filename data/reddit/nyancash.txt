Just got confirmed, yes
@_date: 2019-03-27 02:13:11
Fee was 0.00003264 which was the max it would allow
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:16:46
I would like to believe so, but my transaction is still pending after 4 hours with the highest mining fees my wallet could give it.
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:45:41
no, let people earn it and feel some dignity 
@_date: 2019-03-27 00:35:31
No, that is not true. I sent BTC from JAXX wallet, still pending.

He doesn't believe it, shaking his head the whole time

I told buddy to buy BCH....went up 50% today lol. He was pretty choked
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:45:57
This. Used it often until KYC.
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:25:31
No kidding....I have been bugging a few buddies to get in at the bottom and they went and bought Gold instead.

Well, CIBC locked my account for using shakepay.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:35:11
I notice that lately for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:10:49
Makes sense. So buying is OK, but selling isn't.

Isn’t he involved with bitconnnect was well?  I was banned from the SV sub for talking about this.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:12:39
Parabolic. 20K within 45 days
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:56:57
In Canada we have the same problem.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:11:34
I heard the pilots were too scared to go that is why they stopped.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:32:12
No, it will crash at 20K back to 7K
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:01:25
Yes Air France has a Paris flight on its way....weird.
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:58:01
Ya, ok lol
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:10:18
Yes but I don’t know what to believe anymore. I have friends in the same city....one says things are ok and other says they are not. I don’t trust the Americans or our media. It’s like something isn’t right in all this. Only way to know for sure if going there myself, which I don’t have that much vested interest to do.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:03:13
Because of American sanctions. This whole thing is caused by America over oil.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:58:42
How much BTC did she want? I am in Canada, there has to be a way we can help her get some.
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:00:34
I agree, but we are experiencing a pump and dump right now
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:21:26
Seriously, this shouldn’t be super hard to do. Do you have relatives anywhere else?
