I don't even know where to start, when examining your - in many ways - utterly malicious agenda-driven posting.
TL;DR: "Drop the bomb" and publish those undisputible evidences and file a lawsuit against accused people,
or sh*t the fck up and stop spreading unqualifiable rumors with no substance while begging for donations!
I hope, you don't call you anyhow a Journalist, but more as a Lobbyist/Influencer?


Well, you know it is highly possible those blocking might be an issue on your or Twitters side,
yet you insinuate the former Chancellor (of little Austria) is actively, somehow abled to influence the most leftist social-media Platform in the world...
I mean, we are talking about the place where the so called Twitteria constantly-outraged elite-leftists hops on every shitstorm, to show their well inscenized morality/social justice affiliation (as long as the others pay for it, of course...)
You can't be f'n serious!?
The next thing you seem to "criticize" from a totally ideologist point of view,
that you call him a right-wing populist, as if he were a convicted Übernazi and the reincarnation of Hitler himself,
while insinuating every other position than far-left is absolutely inacceptible and needs to be fought with all means,
even if this involves the same techniques the Nazi regimes perfectioned 80 years ago.
But it doesn't bother you to use those techniques, or?
You can't be f'n serious!?
As Austria isn't that far away from Russia, and has (at least some) geostrategical meanings in the heart of Europe,
I am very astonished that it surprises you, that a Chancellor has different kinds of connections to other
heads of states. He also met Angela Merkel, what does this imply for you?!
Or do you really think, Russia is a closer ally than Germany?
You can't be f'n serious!?
What you call a mayor news, is that you spread hearsay, rumors and are actively tried to stay hidden when you first started.
Your Association/Social club registered in Switzerland, with servers operating in Panama, but you and your buddy got unmasked quite quickly.
Most of the forums of the mentioned Newsoutlets (and even one of the most leftsided Platform, derStandard) reporting on your try of
"We heard something but we don't tell you..." have already seen through this cheap assassination-attempt,
pleasently only weeks before the upcoming elections, right?
You and/or your Buddy, former Greenpeace Head of Press, could have done better than that, no?
Don't get me wrong, I don't have much sympathies for the former Chancellor - but, the way
the austrian politics is tried to be manipulated, dirty-campaigned (on all sides)
is far away from democratically acceptable, reprehensible and just disgusting.
That leads me to the bitcoin-related part of your posting.
The way you are doing it, is absolutly not acceptable to beg for quite intransparent way of funding political "work".
You try to abuse the name of Journalism and Whistleblowers to collect money you will most certainly never report in a
"how Zoom got financed-Report", don't you?
Haven't you and/or Buddy been so succesful in the last years (also in the Bitcoinosphere, too?),
so why you ask for other peoples money then!?
I think, it is a shame you ask for support as a Whistleblower - while not even have blown the whistle yet!
That said, you better release and publish those undisputable evidences of corruption, drug abuse
and other law-relevant things - as you state you have them at hand - because your reputation is already down the drain,
and will stay there until you can deliver what you pretend to have evidences to.
Last, but not least, and to mention again, you a trying to beg for donations under a smokescreen
and selling this as "bitcoin will be in the news because of our made up story" which is so shameful and disgusting,
throwing the most shady light - not only on Journalists - but also on Bitcoin(ers) possible.
So don't try to sell this, as if it would be a good thing to be associated with (supposedly wrong) whistleblowers that did not even blew the whistle so far.
only my 2 sats on this topic.

no, he won't.
Because: he/they spread rumors and hearsay, but did not deliver anything substantial, let alone evidences. just a shitshow for clicks and giggles, throwing dirt a few weeks before an election.
Also not anything that is anyhow mentioned, is rated as state-secrets or is anyhow related to something that could affect which might be called "national security" in the U.S.
EDIT: oh, but of course he/they might face some legal problems, if their claims are proven wrong or are debunked as fakenews, just trying to manipulate the elections.

You might oversee, that carrying the equivalent of Gold in 500 Simbabwe Dollars, a few thousand Bolivars or whatever national 2nd tier/3rd world country currency isn't comparable, not even practical possible.
Why? Because none of them are transferrable over this wonderful thing we call the Internet.
With further adoption/widespread use etcetera, the only logical conclusion is less volatility, hence more stability on a global range.
Nixons let go of the gold standard  in the 70ies was an act to finance a war, mostly important for the local US (military...)
We are talking a global transferable unit of account, of value, of exchange - even for those that only handle fractions of Dollars a day to survive.

Former Chancellor ;)
EDIT: and so far Zoom is publicly claiming they might know that Kurz may have done something wrong, but still hasn't delivered any evidence - so far.
In German: "typischer Wahlk(r)ampf der Linken, mit Schmutz werfen und hoffen das irgendwas schon hängenbleiben wird".
I think he meant the german-languaged area/media as a whole, not only the country itself.
I agree with his observations on what was happening the last few years, regarding to what and/or how you are "allowed" to say (or not to say anymore...)
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:04:44
Also in all fairness, Austria as a country doesn't move at all :P ;)
Chancellor Kurz was overthrown at the end of May, and every german-languaged News was full of how, why and Ibiza, BVT,... for weeks...
Also changes in our political leadership tend to happen quite often and quickly in the last few years.
But I get what you say by pointing out, the last time you checked he was the chancellor of Austria.
Most people in the world (even in Europe!) don't even know who is chancellor of Austria, let alone where it is on the map... or that we really have no Kangaroos.
But what do you expect of people that still think Hitler was a German...

Thanks for your reply. The VPS infrastructure was, or is, the "missing link" to me.
Which means, if I am able to set up a small scale "VPS Infrastructure", I could host a few BTCPay Server, for like 3-5 Merchants in my local area, on my own hardware.
I guess I still do have some reading to do around those topics (mainly software requirements, recommended settings etc) before I can handle this without dependencies of someone elses ("3rd party") services.

@_date: 2019-06-12 12:37:21
Why do you repeat the obvious and empowering my argument!?
English isn't my native language but, as I said, like 4 times now:
 ...percent of Bitcoin mining is performed by six **mining pools**
 **MANAGED** by individuals or companies **BASED** in China.
I'll translate this to you one more time: only because many of the **worldwide** produced hashrate is **reported to / adminstrated in / converged in / ending at a POOL** that is **only managed** by someone in China, does **not** mean, that they actually have control over anything close to this percentual amount of this hashrate.
Why? Easy, because if every other Miner from **OUTSIDE** of China, suddenly (or necessarily) stops to report their massive numbers of hashwork done to a chinese POOL, and redirect this to any other Pool, like Slushpool in Slovenia - this would lead to the same stupid non-argument like: "ermagerd, Slovenian based individuals or companies has now something like 40-50% of hashrate, we're all gonna die! Sloveniacoin will be dead in the water"...
Do you finally understand that approximately 35-50% (buest guess after all my years in the field) of those allegedly reported 70something% **is not produced in China**, but only **REPORTED TO** China, for profitability reasons. These Pools only MANAGE the incoming hashrate, do the accounting depending on the work done and then payout/ divide the reward-income among all contributing Pool-Members.
**no more, no less**
Gzus, it's not that hard!

5% less is nothing, compared to what would happen when ppl stay just inactive, while any pool gains too much power (51%...), or tries malicious things (remember the stupid bcash fork and the two years before?)!
It is still also a voting-mechanism! If something odd happens -&gt; 5 minutes later I and every other miner that disagree with their (chinese pools) shenanigans will switch elsewhere -&gt; problem solved. Bitcoin saved.

Always depends on your personal situation.
Is 800$ a monthly wage or a substantial amount for you?
Is 800$ just peanuts to you, play money? No Credit debts? No obligations?
If you have a decent job, already have something like an emergency fund (for example to get along 3-6 months without problems in case of emergency, losing the job, or need a new fridge, car repair...whatever)...
If not, this should be your real first achievement on your list.
After that, think about which ($) sum you can easily afford to save every month, or that you would just blow away. "play money". From that number find an adequate %age of how much do you feel comfortable to use to buy bitcoin. "Dollar Cost Averaging" every month or bi-weekly gets you to your 0.1 BTC and beyond in no time.
Never use money that you could might need in the next few weeks/months. This is also the best way to keep a sane mind, when the big dips occur. Because, it's not gone and you aren't forced to sell, because it was only play money you'd have wasted anyway - so you can wait (hodl) until you're (far) back in the green.
So, the achievement you are looking for, should be to slowly build a comfortable position/situation.
And on this way, of course, read/view/learn as much as possible how to handle/protect/backup/restore/ and use this form of money in a secure and proper way.
Oh, and always remember... bitcoins left ("stored") on an exchange aren't your bitcoins.
"not your private key? not your bitcoins!"
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:24:36
Do you really want to tell me, that you (they) found a way to identify and differentiate how much % of the hashrate is from the Pool-Operator (Owner) and/or located in China or under chinese control!?
If that is the case, where are these numbers from?
Did the Pooloperators have disclosed all their Data, like how many % are their own equipment, and how many other induviduals (like me) report/add their hashrate from outside of China = to their Pool?
Can't see this information and I don't believe they would disclose this informations at all.
For me, this "ermagaahd, China rules us" is just FUD, because I know plenty Miners (outside of China) just report their Hashwork to a "chinese Pool" (because of profitability) and can switch to every other Pool within a few minutes, if necessary.
@_date: 2019-06-12 12:42:27

@_date: 2019-06-12 13:42:16
Well, yes, the one or another has been seen ;)
 currently lists 4939 of this machines, with 147.643 "other services" in 77 countries.
List not completed, I guess, as not every Operator automatically registers their ATM on this site.
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:04:34
The POOLS sitting/operating in/from China sum up for 60%, yes.
This does NOT necessarily mean, that the hardware/miner/hashrate is physically located or even under control of these POOL-Operators.
My Hashrate from Europe (for example) is also accounted for, at an "chinese operated" POOL.
POOLS "combine" and manage Hashrate from all over the World, but DO NOT have direct access to all the hardware, as many of that it is not even located on the same continent - as for my example (and many others I do know, that "report" their Hashrate to "China" = in other words: to a Chinese operated POOL!)
Slush-Pool for example is operating in Slovenia (IIRC?) and manages around 10-12% of the global pooled hashrate.
OF COURSE, this 10-12% of global hashrate isn't physically located in Slovenia, but comes from distributed individuals REPORTING their Hashrate to the Slush-Pool.

if then, in the year 2140, the absolut last of the new (parts of a) bitcoins is mined, the miners make their revenue solely from the fees that the sender of each on-chain-transaction has to add, to get their tx confirmed.
In 2024 about 93,75% of all coins will be mined, and the reward will only be 6,25 BTC per Block + the Fees for all transactions done/included/confirmed in that block.
As we expect to scale the technology and TPS (also with Lightning etc.) to a quite larger level until that time (like the year 202*something), the revenue made from the tx-fees will exceed those from the blockrewards.

By the time this really gets relevant, many things have to be considered first.
IF (in like 10 years, or even more) there is any QC economical affordable to build and operate, many other things will be an even better target than Bitcoin.
Also, IF this becomes relevant in some time, the necessary changes to the (few) parts affected on Bitcoin will be changed. There will be consensus very fast.
But for now, it is just not even necessary to "waste" development time and efforts, as it will take years before this even gets relevant.
For now, developers can/have to concentrate on more important topics. Like further scaling methods and so on.

I already did, last year. You too?


Which is exactly what I am saying! Just because they manage (!) an amount of X% of the hashrate that is reported to them from all over the world, it does NOT automatically mean
that they have control over this entire percentage!
Once again, EVERY miner (all over the world) that only reports his hashrate to a pool, can easily change this (to another pool, or whatever) by the whim of an eye.
And you can expect that a lot of American or Canadian Hashrate is also pointed at those "chinese" pools, just because for one simple reason = profitability! Which, once again, means this hashrate isn't by any means under control of china/chinese operators.

@_date: 2019-06-15 12:14:23
You completely ignore the relevant main argument...
There is no issue, as any miner from anywhere in the world can just switch to another (non-chinese-operated) Pool. Therefore those "chinese" Pools have neither power, control or whatever you try to suggerate.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:33:41
No because, AFAIK, Pools "consist" of hundreds of individual Miners just "reporting" their Hashrate to the Pool, which does not mean that the Pools have any influence, or control, about the hashing power.
THey just "administrate" and pay out.
My Miner in Spain is reporting to one of the big Pools "managed in China" too.
I can change that every single minute, like every other Miner too.
Slush Pool for Example has (had) like 10% of overall Hashrate, which NEITHER means, that they (the pool) control it, nor that this Hashrate is located in Slovenia (?).
