Thank you, this is exactly the info I was looking for! 
So, you lost 20$ and 4 days going this route, eh?

I'm pretty sure all of this can be completed in 24-48 hours, costing me an extra $5 moneypak card. This is preferred over a 20% markup (below). 
**I was just curious as to if my plan overview will work, the technical aspects of VIRWOX, any holds they put on new accounts. Also the cost to trade on VIRWOX, and the cost to trade on blockchain.info**

What fees are we talking about? I asked if there would be fees in the OP but I couldn't locate them on the sites
I'm a total noob at this
to expand on this: $5 paypal card, -&gt; buy SLL -&gt; sell SLL for BTC -&gt; place BTC in eWallet 
Where would expenses come in at?

Nah, no protection on either end.

I have a paypal, can you directly buy from an exchange with USD? Please suggest something... please :)
Also, what the time line for this process paypal&gt;btc? 1-2days?

I see, makes sense about your grace period (that why I asked).
What about an exchange like  ? It looks like you can directly add a VISA or Paypal to your wallet there, still looking though...

You can go to pharmacies and grocery stores to purchase a Greendot Moneypak, which you load with cash. Enter that serial # on the back into your paypal, instant transfer.
