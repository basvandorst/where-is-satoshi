ITT too many people not understand the concept of "Machine Payable Web", and confusing it with the HTML web.
This has nothing to do with webpages. He only used that as an analogy so that non-devs could relate to what he was saying. The system he is describing is exclusively for system APIs. So instead of buying access to an API first and then getting access to its functionality, you can actually pay for the usage as you use it, no need for a contract or to have a bank account.
This idea frees up the world of APIs and allows you to make sample calls for a very low cost. Testing a suite of APIs would no longer require multiple accounts and signing up for multiple fixed term contracts. It would remove a lot of barriers for system development. All in all, this is a really great idea.

Kind of, in the same way there are two Ethereums.

Yeah, I feel like this a lot. So many accusations on both sides, I don't know how to judge it all. Are both subs manipulated by shills of opposing powers operating from the shadows? Or is this just the usual par for the course when an open source project can't reach consensus and the differing views fork from each other (plus added bitterness because money is involved)?

But how do we identify a compromised crypto? Is BTC compromised or is BCH compromised? Both? If so what evidence is there? How can we trust the evidence?
This whole thing reminds me of an article I read about what a sophisticated state sponsored social engineering attack would look like.

This is the correct answer.
