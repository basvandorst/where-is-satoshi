Another lurker checking in. I dont really have much to add to the conversation but when I do ill comment. Ive just started using bitcoins and am currently day trading (to some extent) just to get a feel for the economy. Once it's stabalised I'll be using this as actual currency.

Please explain
@_date: 2011-06-03 05:35:18
so are the bitcoins associated with an address or a wallet?

How is it going for you? Do you get many sales?

So transferring bitcoins between multiple addresses stops people from being able to chase the "money trail" so to speak?
@_date: 2011-06-03 05:56:59
So if I make one for each transaction does that mean I have to manage multiple addresses or is that the whole point of a wallet?

I think hes asking how to do that

You're a Christian and that one belief makes no sense?

Its all about the money. People are willing to contribue cpu/gpu power as long as they have a monetary incentive.

If you were going to mine on that scale wouldnt you just use the same hardware instead of buying a whole bunch of different cards? This looks more like a warehouse of an actual pc parts store. I'd be more likely to believe this is it was all unboxed and set up.
