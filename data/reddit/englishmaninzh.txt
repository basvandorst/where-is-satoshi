In the months before Mt. Gox's collapse, the bitcoin exchange was coming under increasing pressure from one of its banks, which complained about unmanageable volume of money transfers and repeatedly asked the exchange to close its account with the bank, people familiar with the situation say.
Mizuho Bank, which handled international wire transfers and other Mt. Gox business at a branch in Tokyo's Shibuya district, had become worried about Mt. Gox as early as mid-2013, following reports that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had seized money from a Mt. Gox account at a U.S. bank, these people say.
Mizuho started having concerns about Mt. Gox's large volumes of money transfers at a time when U.S. authorities were investigating whether business dealings involving bitcoin could be linked to money laundering, said one person close to the situation.
That person also confirmed the authenticity of a recording, circulating widely on the Internet through social media, of a conversation in Japanese between an official from Mizuho Bank and Mt. Gox's head, Mark Karpeles, in late January. The tape indicated that Mizuho was stepping up a push to disassociate itself from Mt. Gox.
In the conversation, the bank official repeated a request that Mt. Gox close its account with Mizuho and warned that it might take steps to close it if Mt. Gox refused. Mr. Karpeles said on the tape he wanted to keep the account.
On the tape, the Mizuho official can be heard saying, "As we've been saying many times, we want to close your account."
Mr. Karpeles responds: "I discussed with my lawyers and they said we don't need to close it, so we'd like to keep it."
The bank official then says that while it would like Mt. Gox to close its account voluntarily, "the chance isn't zero that we will leave you no choice."
In mid-2013, after the Department of Homeland Security action, Mt. Gox halted dollar withdrawals temporarily. A person close to Mt. Gox said that move came after Mizuho declined to process withdrawals in dollars.
The snowballing popularity of bitcoin and the resulting growth in Mt. Gox's customer base appear to have raised the volume of money transfers for the bank.
Japanese banks can close accounts only under certain conditions. In the taped conversation, the Mizuho official didn't indicate any specific concern about Mt. Gox's compliance with bank rules. When Mr. Karpeles asked why the bank wanted to close the account, the Mizuho official cited "a collection of various issues."
Possibly exacerbating the issue was that the demands to close the account came as the bank was dealing with a public-relations predicament of its own. Japan's Financial Services Agency was investigating Mizuho for loans that its Orient Corp. consumer-credit affiliate had allegedly made to members of crime groups.
Asked to comment on the audio file, Mr. Karpeles responded in an email, "This recording was not published by us."
A lawyer in charge of Mt. Gox's filing for bankruptcy protection said on Tuesday, "Our priority right now is to fully cooperate with requests from Japanese and other authorities. Therefore we can't make comments to the media at this moment."
He declined to elaborate on which authorities have made requests.
In August 2013, Mt. Gox applied for a license to operate a money-services business in Hong Kong, hoping to move a majority of its banking to the city, the person close to Mt. Gox said. Documents filed with the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department show that Mt. Gox obtained a license in October in Hong Kong to operate such a business. Mt. Gox lists an address in the city belonging to an office-services provider.
Mr. Karpeles already had a business connection to Hong Kong. In 2011, he registered Tibanne Ltd. in the city, listing the company as having HK$10,000 in capital, according to documents filed with the Hong Kong government. It didn't list its intended business activity.
The bank issues facing Mt. Gox took a backseat as technical challenges in its bitcoin exchange operations grew. On Feb. 7, it halted bitcoin withdrawal requests, blaming a bug in the bitcoin software that it said could make fraudulent withdrawals possible.
Even before that, investors were already complaining about long delays in getting money transfers processed.
Several people close to Mt. Gox have said a big pile of withdrawal requests grew further as Japanese banks took a weeklong New Year holiday. Mt. Gox investors in Tokyo started noticing delays in dollar withdrawals in December, while yen-withdrawal delays didn't begin until January.
Tang Shunning, a Mt. Gox investor living in Japan, said his requests to withdraw yen from his Mt. Gox bitcoin account took only two days to complete in December, while in early January, two transactions of about 100,000 yen (around $1,000) each took about a week to clear.
Mr. Tang said he withdrew around ¥6 million in late January, three weeks after he made the request.
According to what he said was a screenshot of his bank transactions, his last withdrawal from Mt. Gox was on Feb. 12, after Mt. Gox had halted bitcoin withdrawals but was still working through its pile of cash-withdrawal requests. Four weeks after he made the withdrawal request, Mr. Tang was able to withdraw ¥8.8 million.
On Feb. 25, a few days before it filed for bankruptcy protection, Mt. Gox halted all transactions.
Separately, Japan's government was preparing to clarify its view on bitcoin, officials said, though they appeared no closer to declaring a specific agency in charge of overseeing the virtual currency.
People familiar with a draft being prepared for a cabinet meeting scheduled for Friday say the government will reaffirm that Japan doesn't consider bitcoin a currency, which has been the basis for the argument by the Financial Services Agency, Japan's banking watchdog, that bitcoin shouldn't be subject to its oversight.

I can't help but think the pace of Bitcoin sales at Overstock is slowing. It was ca. $150k on day 1 and $1MM on day 60. Not encouraging in my eyes. Though obviously more data points would be helpful.

What do you mean? The volume is clear to see on Mt Gox. And with the grind lower in Mt Gox continuing, Bitstamp is heading south too. I think that could be explained by the flow of BTC from Mt Gox to Bitstamp, and the flow of USD from Bitstamp to Mt Gox. Just a theory. No evidence.

Gambling on random events suits Bitcoin well. Lots of punters put their chips in the middle and pray to lady luck. Satoshi Dice is the most obvious example. 
However, I think there could be a problem when betting on 'events', eg sporting events, political events, financial markets events. When a punter who has influence (or insider information) on the outcome of an event, they will be able to arbitrage money out of the straight punters. In the UK there is a company called Betfair which allows such betting on 'events'. They are obliged to report any unusual betting patterns, eg, some punter dropping 10x the daily tennis volume on a single game between Federer and Davydenko. Betfair can refuse to pay out if there's probable cause that something fishy has gone on, and as accounts at Betfair are linked to bank accounts they can get the police involved. Presumably with Bitcoin this traceability wouldn't exist and so people would avoid Bitcoin markets under the assumption they were fixed.

If by volume you mean exchange volume, I would say yes. If you mean blockchain volume, I'd say I haven't checked (!).

I think the exchange of BTC to fiat needs regulation. Not BTC itself.

Banks receive the funds by the morning of the next day (at the latest). However, this was not the case in years gone by. Instead it took approx 3 days for the bank to receive money and credit the right account with all the necessary checks and balances. As customers are typically of the mindset "oh, I'll probably see it in another couple of days", it means the banks have access to near-free funding for 2 days. Multiply this by the millions of payments that take place each day and banks have a very steady supply of cash to invest / cheaply cover shortfalls.

This Karpeles guy is in trouble. He's upset a lot of people. Many of these people he's upset aren't like you and me. They are criminals, drug dealers, gangsters and corrupt politicians. You don't want to be on these people's shit list. It's going to be very hard for him to hide completely. By no means do I wish an early demise on anyone, but I feel Mark would do well to avoid such a conclusion.
