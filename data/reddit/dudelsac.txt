I also think that this discussion is very good and thank you for raising your points contrary to my own opinion. Helps to see the whole picture.
And yes, all I want from discussing this so vehemently is protection - but not for me, but for those newbie users that may be enthusiastic about bitcoin, only to fall for a scammer and thus be scarred about this technology. And if we can negate that risk by having people submit one proper photo as proof, I think it will be in the interest of every bitcoin enthusiast.

Yeah, this is probably a great idea for a celebrity ...

As BashCo has posted below, a simple photo of him holding his id would be sufficient. But curiously, that request got ignored and instead he posted a photo of him and Dorian - which could easily be obtained via other channels.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:16:15
Nope, Germany.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:24:06
He verified it via a photo of his id that could easily be faked and a photo of Arthur and Dorian, which could come from many different channels. Heck, it could be a photo that already was on the net before.
Don't get me wrong, I also think the guy is legit. But having proper proof for these kinds of posts is important, especially for the future.

Wow, thanks for this link - there is a bitcoin bar RIGHT IN MY STREET, which I didn't know of. I'm looking forward to bring them my business! :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:29:01
He could fake it to build trust that he could later misuse. I'm not saying it is bound to happen, but it *could*. And I think that we shouldn't be taking that risk when it is easily dismissed by having him take a good photo for proper proof.

First of all, my deepest condolences. 
It looks like your husband could have a substantial amount of wealth stored away, so excuse me for the long text. I just want to make sure that you are absolutely clear about the fact that many people are thinking about how to steal those coins, right now.
Many others have said it, but please, DO NOT SHARE ANY MORE INFORMATION with ANYONE about this. Even some of the answers you gave on here could be used against you, if you were to disclose more details. 
Also, and this is very important: It sounds like your husband was into bitcoins for a longer amount of time - and bitcoin value has increased TREMENDOUSLY in that time. That means that even if your husband had only a few coins, they are potentially worth thousands if not tens of thousands of Dollars.
And by posting here, you have disclosed that information, which makes you the target of lots of people that will steal those coins faster than you can imagine. So it is essential that you DO NOT VISIT ANY WEBSITES that get sent to you via PM. Each one of them could potentially be a phishing attempt to steal your coins. Please use only the official information that is available, for example in the sidebar on here. 
The last thing, which is also very important: You should first get your own wallet, a small amount of coins and learn at least the basics of bitcoin, so you don't do any fatal errors. Bitcoin is not as user-friendly as it could be - if you send bitcoins to a wrong wallet for example, that process is irreversible and the coins would be lost forever. Once you are confident enough to use the seed and get your husband's wallet, make absolutely sure that you are using a virus free computer (Mac or Linux preferred). Every little russian kid can program a keylogger these days, and steal your coins in the blink of an eye.
And if you don't know what a keylogger is, than please learn all of this before attempting to recover your husband's bitcoins. They could easily be worth a lifechanging amount of money, and I wish you that the future changes in your life will be more positive than the one you have to endure at the moment.
Again, my deepest condolences. And now, please stop posting on here and best delete this throwaway account. It's in your best interest.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:04:51
Are you serious? People are committing suicide over the amounts of bitcoins they lose and you are asking so what?
Even if it's just a lame troll - Do you really want to be a place where trolls can do whatever they want? Without any intervention by the mods? Honest question, I cannot wrap my head around that.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:28:21
Indeed :) 
Have you been there? Looks pretty nice, doesn't it? I wish they would offer food too ...
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:56:37
They haven't yet - but they could easily be building up trust to misuse it at a later point in time ...
I was wondering that the cry for real proof was so dampened. Some users in are VERY gullible.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:14:33
It's the exact type of verification that "looks okay!", but could very easily be faked.
Everyone can get a fake id and a picture of two guys that probably is somewhere on the net as well ...
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:26:44
That's the thing: I also think they are legit. But in the interest of the newer users, we should make sure that posters like this really are. Or else we are setting a precedent here for future trolls or scammers.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:28:52
Thanks for your message, appreciate you taking the initiative. 
Also, my original post sounded more negative than I wanted. You are doing a good job moderating this sub, but I would wish for a little more insistence when it comes to posting *proper* proof. In the interest of those readers that are more gullible than the average one.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:59:41
We should organize a bitcoin flash mob :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:39:36
A good place to start is the [discussion]( in your linked post.
Possible doubts are: 
1. It could just be a fake id of which a real picture was taken. This way, no tampering would show up in Foto Forensics.
2. The photo of him and Dorian could be just a photo that is on the net.
There is a reason why has clear rules about the [kind of proof that they accept]( Usually, an id is not enough - it's only proper proof when the person is taking a photo of him/her holding the piece of identification.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:56:23
Excuse me if this may sound rude - but in my opinion it is the mod-team's job to demand proof preemptively. **Otherwise, this is a paradise for scammers.**
I mean just about every other subreddit has clear rules for submitting proper proof. But in here, *where peoples' money is at stake*, I see multiple posts a day that are just taken at face value ... 
We are demanding that newsweek should offer proper proof before publishing something, but every idiot can impersonate someone in and no kind of proof is demanded ...
I ask you to bring that up in the mod-team - you don't want this subreddit to be the birthing place of a large scam.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:21:22
Well, we were one of the first countries with an official stance on it.
Or maybe we're just hipsters :D
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:45:32
Sure. [Here you go.](
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:16:48
And one of them is the bar I was talking about :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:52:22
How did he make that money from the demise of gox?
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:23:47
Easy: Build up trust by impersonating someone. Then find a gullible user that you can social engineer into doing something dumb. It has happened many times in Bitcoin history.
It's not good enough for me, but that's not why I am posting in here. I'm posting on behalf of those users that fall for a scam akin to this - and then tell all their friends of how they lost bitcoins to a scammer, shining a bad light on the whole idea.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:12:00
Yes, an informed reader will do that. But there are so many people out there that take such posts at face value - because, hey, they're at the frontpage, they must be true!!
In the interest of every bitcoin enthusiast, those newbies should be protected from any scam attempt or from misinformation. If we don't safeguard them, they might easily be social engineered to do something dumb - and tell everyone of the "scammy nature of bitcoin". That association could be the true blow to Bitcoin's future. If this is a place where trolls and scammers have an easy life, then we are doing something very, very wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:07:10
The license could easily be a fake and the picture of him and Dorian could just as easily be publicly available.
I mean, the proof he offered would not be accepted in - then why should it be accepted in where peoples' money is at stake?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:31:32
Good point. Still, no one wants to hound anyone. All that is needed for proper proof is a simple photo of the person holding an id and preferably a piece of paper with the current date on it. That's really not too much to ask, is it?
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:37:31
The mods can't validate the authenticity, but they can ask for proof in an official way. [Just as it is done in This would lend more credibility to the account.
Also, if the proof is not sufficient, the mods are the only ones that can take posts offline.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:07:37




@_date: 2013-03-20 17:04:19
Damn, bad typo. Well, now my post doesn't really make sense at all. Still shows there is lots of interest from spain, but in the reverse direction I guess.
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:15:40
It would definitely solve the problem about the "50!!", "55!" "70!OMG!!" posts that tend to fill /new everytime there's a hype.
But aside from the points that Bitcoinin brought up, it's also a technical problem. I moderate other subs and we already tried something like this. The problem is that mods can only change the CSS, not the html of the site. So you cannot have a live ticker, but you'd need a bot instead that crawls the newest prices and puts them into the sidebar css at regular intervalls. Which, if you'd want a ticker that is useful and not showing old data, would result in some server load for reddit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:13:56
No. Just no. Noone on here with a little bit of sense will tell you that it's a good idea.
I know the prospect of making money quick is tempting, but what you are forgetting is the first rule of investment:
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.**
And selling your car just to spend the money in coins is totally against that idea. 
But let me tell you one thing: You can be proud of how you care about your family. Really. You're awesome for trying to correct the mistakes in your earlier life. Just don't make those mistakes again and invest important money into a high risk investment. You should always expect that bitcoins are worth zero tomorrow. It's the only realistic way to handle the latest explosion.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:34:08
Interesting trivia I read on reddit: BBC Radio 4's continued broadcast is also [one of the checks]( that are supposed to be made in case the UK got destroyed by an enemy nuclear strike.
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:13:00
You are right, the image needs to be uploaded to reddit to be included in the sidebar.
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:08:28
When you do a public statement, please answer zeco's question about the irregular trades that were on bitcoin-24.com before it closed. Will those trades be reversed? How long did you have that problem?
I have some money on bitcoin-24.com also, because I thought it was a great exchange and I trusted you. I hope all users can get their money back.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:20:24
I work in online business and would love to help testing your site!
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:36:59
fyi: This was the top shared article on Twitter yesterday for the term "bitcoin". Combined with the huge Mt.gox verification queue, I think the interest in buying still is pretty high.
