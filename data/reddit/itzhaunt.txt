You only have to pay taxes when you 'realise your gains' or whatever fancy term they use. So if you are not buying/selling or trading for alts, but rather using it as payment you can't be taxed. I imagine it would be looked at as a sort of gift, because you are giving it, and not selling it. 
As I was typing this I realized that gov could reverse this, and say that you did 'realize you gains'. Even though you never transfered into another asset or traded for fiat. Now I agree with you, I guess this is gov's way of killing other currencies.

Paying someone in bitcoin is not a taxable event. However, if you were to first trade the bitcoin, then you would have to pay taxes.

People that want the price to drop so they can buy more.

Mining them is essentially making them. There is far too much that is involved that I would like to explain on here, but look at the original white paper to get at least a general understanding.

Bitcoin has a big influence when it comes to trading alt coins. So when bitcoin trading slows down, alt coins normally do to. Although some don't.

We are at the part where the kingdoms and empires are just discovering its value. Then they fight wars over it.

I know, I went on a bit of a rant lol

Well yes, but what I meant was they can't keep track of every person's transactions. The blockchain would have the history of every transaction made, but one can have multiple address without anyone knowing your other address, unless you give it to an exchange or do something else that would expose it.

Do you mean default as pay off the debt?

I have never seen a wallet that asks for your age. What wallet did you try to use?

Don't use coinbase

Maybe it's just a display bug. Have you tried checking the coinpot website?

Did you mod those bitcoins like you modded that lambo?

Put the money into Paypal, go from there. 
Edit: I also wouldn't recommend Coinbase. They have transaction fees of ~$2 and are monitored by fbi. So if you are investing in bitcoin to make small private transactions, choose a different wallet.

Sure. We could say that.

It's just a hypothetical question.

I imagine this bill is aimed for the high rollers, or the ones that have just become instant millionaires. They can't possibly keep track of every transaction, and if you never link your address with your identity then they could never charge you. 
Also suppose you did try to evade the crypto taxes. If you encrypted anything to do with it they could never prove you owned anything. Assuming you never listed your ID on any exchanges or gave up your true ip when making transaction. 
Honestly I see this thing being a giant mess. People getting false tax evasion charges, ALL exchanges would be forced to require an ID, wallet software secretly complying with LE. It's just going to be bad.

I use exodus on pc or blockchain on mobile. Neither of those have exchanges though. 
The other person that replied to me mentioned that not many reliable exchanges accept paypal. Which i realised was true. Bitcoin.com lists some exchanges that they recommend. Maybe you'll have better luck with one of those.

With the rapid growth of bitcoin i seen it getting banned soon in western counties, at least in the U.S. It is competition to the government. The government only has economical power if the people use their currency. With the more people that use bitcoin, the less people that will use fiat. We already seen this happen in New York.

The blockchain. Once they know one person's address, they can potentially figure out who owns the addresses of whoever they transact with. They can track where the coins go, where they came from, and how much each address has. Putting these two things together can prove to have serious complications for privacy, etc. 
That's why I think currencies like Monero will explode once more people learn about them.

Because the mods don't like people asking for people to give them bitcoin on here. You could try on r/bitcoinbeggars
