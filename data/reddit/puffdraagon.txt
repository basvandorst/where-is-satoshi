Just doing a quick calc indicates an expected 3.5 days.  Give it another day. I don't think it's terribly low.

First question is why are you using coinbase?  You have a 3rd party risk if you do not have the private key.  If you want to hodl some coins put those in a hardware wallet or cold storage.  I have just changed to an electrum cold storage wallet and feel a lot better than when my coins were on blockchain.  Remember the adage. If you dont own the private key you don't own the coins.

But we don't own bitcoin we just control a wallet that may or may not have btc in it. And it may or may not be the only wallet we have control over. :)

First consider the time period of the chart you are looking at.  Typically 1min 5min 15min 30min 1hr 4hr 1d 1w 1m. 
Open is the price at the start of the new period. 
Close is the price at the end of the period.  Generally the close of the last is the same as the open of the next. High is the highest price reached during the period and low is the lowest price reached during the period. 
Candlesticks show each of these clearly on charts. 
Volume is the total btc/fiat/stock etc traded during the period.
Weighted average here:
