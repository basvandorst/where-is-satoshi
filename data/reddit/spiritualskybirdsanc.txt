Anyone can package and sell FPGAs. 
Creating custom ASICs is 1000x more complex a project.
Saying "Well they delivered the FGPAs so they must be able to deliver ASICs too!" is like teaching your dog to fetch with a rubber ball and thinking that next thing you know he'll be manufacturing rubber balls himself.

Only a complete retard would buy an ASIC now, and especially from BFL.
Firstly, they aren't going to ship until difficulty goes right up because everyone else has shipped first. That means you won't get a couple of hundred a month. You'll be lucky to cover the price of the electricity to run the unit. You might never see a profit on the purchase price.
Secondly, they might not ship at all because their CEO is a convicted felon ($20m fraud) and they have acted shady the entire time.
If you want to invest $150 in Bitcoin, buy $150 worth of Bitcoin. Except don't do it right now because we're at the top of a bubble. Do it the next time it crashes (probably 1-2 weeks max)

Imagine crying over money. Not lost money, just a missed opportunity for money. Your parents sound like empty, hollow, pathetic, miserable people.

I'd cancel immediately.
When the shit hits the fan (as it almost certainly will) then you will lose your money.
Or even if they eventually deliver, you'll end up with a unit that you never see an ROI on.
Either way you are throwing away cash money.
Also you won't see many people speaking out against BFL, because Theymos, the guy who runs the BitcoinTalk forum and also moderates this reddit is a big investor in the company. If anyone mentions that fact then the posts mysteriously disappear. Expect to see this one go soon too, if you even get a chance to read it. If we were on BitcoinTalk it would be gone instantly, I've tried!
Either that or it will get downvoted into oblivion by BFLs paid shills. Or I say paid, really they've been promised free units.  They also have an army of fanboys who cheer them on as if they are their football team for seemingly no reason, just like Pirateat40 did.

Agreed, Ver is a total idiot.
