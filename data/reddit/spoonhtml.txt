At what point do we hit a threshold where the reputation of bitcoin is irreparably harmed? I'm stirring conversation, above all else.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:52:53
Three words when it comes to bitcoin.
Anything is possible.
If it were to rise to 100,000USD by the end of 2018, I wouldn't be shocked. You just can't be surprised anymore. I'd be more surprised if it went sub 2000$.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:24:29
Great point. Exactly what I was looking for in writing up my post. 
We all see things our way-- and look to others for alternate perspective. 
That being said-- where do you feel we are with regard to price? Above or below ideal? Or is bitcoin spot on?

I posted a very similar thread in bitcoin, worrying about the use case compared to people chasing price. I remain confident that the technical limitations will be triumphed. Lightning network for example. Though bitcoin was never intended on being the everyday transacted crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:53:34
Just uncalled for.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:09:33
I agree with you. I feel like this surge of dumb money is going to cause a correction. One big enough to fuel the critics and hurt the image of bitcoin as it pertains to future adopters. "Oh look-- it dipped real bad..the bubble theory must be true."
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:50:26
As someone with a bit of an all-in mindset, i'd be more upset if what I sold for profit became worth 10x what I got for it, than if I had lost everything.
I suppose more than the potential financial loss-- I just fear the integrity of bitcoin being tarnished, fueling the critics even further.

To be honest, I think we are above the ideal price. Any influence other than the practicality of the technology would be inflating bitcoin past it's true intrinsic value. 
A huge part of the spike in value as of late is newcomers joining the party looking for a return on an investment. Bitcoin shouldn't be an investment, right? When the rise in price is caused by people buying now to sell higher later, what is bitcoin other than a way of feeding money from newcomer to old-hodler? If there were major breakthroughs and massive adoption among international vendors, at a rate that matches the surging price...I'd sleep well. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:20:14
If bitcoin were to dip, the entire space would take a hit. Because at it stands right now, as mentioned in earlier comments, a lot of the money in crypto is speculative "investment" money. They don't take into account the practicality of a coin's tech, or the real life use case. 
If bitcoin bleeds, it's bad for everyone across the board. 
The only way I see another crypto surpassing, is if bitcoin is thriving, and a new(or already existing) "Competitor" re-invents the wheel to a degree where it cannot be denied. So, I don't think a new king will be found in the middle of a BTC crisis. I think it'll be a passing of the torch where BTC rides into the sunset, bowing it's head honorably.

As it stands today, bitcoin is not fundamentally designed to be the currency that we spend every day.  For coffee, sandwiches and soda. It's best leveraged as a store of value, where you can trust in it's ability to retain if not appreciate it's current worth.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:59:04
If you've ever disliked the fact that sending money through a bank sometimes takes 7-10 business days, or that you have to, in some cases, have their permission to do so...
If you dislike the fact that you must tie your personal details to every transaction you make using modern day banking practices...
If you don't like paying fees and allowing big financial institutions to profit for giving you the "privilege" of letting them hold your money....
A purchase of bitcoin is not moving your money into some stagnant pond, where you're just waiting around and hoping for it to appreciate in value. It's a spendable currency right now-- so there's little risk in buying today, and simply spending it on something you would have otherwise bought tomorrow or a week from now if you so choose to "pull out". Who knows-- you could even find you've gotten a discount in doing so.
Why should you invest in bitcoin? You shouldn't. You should join in on bitcoin. Have some. Use it. Replenish what you spend. There are plenty of other cryptos out there, and the reason why I hang my hat on Bitcoin, is because there's no figurehead with an agenda. Satoshi Nakomoto doesn't have his hands all over the project, and isn't trying to manufacture some niche use. 
Bitcoin gives anyone on the planet the ability to be their own bank.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:41:19
Wallets vary. Bitcoin isn't the problem-- wallets maybe. 
If people are sending 1000$+ for 2-3$, and you're getting hammered for similar fees on a smaller tx, that should reveal something. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:43:49
Are you set up with an exchange? Do you have funds ready? If you make a purchase now without these things, who knows what happens to the price by the time your transactions clear. 
That being said-- could be 4k by end of weekend, could be 3k. Could be 2500. Literally no one can answer this for you. Buy and hold.

I'm American as well, for what it's worth, and I'm pretty aware that there is no middle class. It's far more fragmented than that. Lower, middle, upper? No. It's more like low--and then 1000 different levels between that and the elite. Maybe even more levels.
I happen to be in the group where 7000$ isn't back breaking, but far from wealthy. 
I know for a fact that a majority of people my age and younger(29) cannot afford this barrier of entry, period. Then there are many more who'd not take the risk, because it'd put them in a dangerous situation should bitcoin go poof. 
If you've made it this far, and have &gt;1BTC, you're very fortunate. You got in when it wasn't scary to lose, and now it's all gravy.

Well, simply put, you're still going to be paying electricity on the device, so that will eat in to your margin-- plus, if you were to buy 4000$ worth of bitcoin 3 years ago-- well, you can do that math as well.
The primary thing to consider is cost of electricity + what you expect bitcoin to be worth 3 years from now.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:16:09
Also, the difficulty of bitcoin rises over time. Mining that is. So you're also banking on the same rate of BTC production from that machine-- when that simply wont be the case. Each year that S9 will be less and less potent at mining.

Doesn't work with coffee. Coffee isn't an asset or a store of value. 
You sell things that:
You don't want. 
You think have peaked in value and will not go higher. 
You can rebuy at a lower price later. 
Need to sell because some other form of money/value is more useful. 
None of those are good things. That's why price goes down.

@_date: 2017-07-20 14:41:41
When it fluctuates between 1000-1500$ there are a certain group of people who aren't phased. The amount of money per coin is within their appetite. 
There are people with bigger appetites. Where swings from 2000-2600 don't phase them. They are happy to wait and play it safer. If it costs more to enter-- they don't care. Especially with the moon in their sights.

From what I read, unless you've got super cheap electric per kW, then the hardware will become "useless" right around the time you've paid your initial investment. 
Couple that with the fact that the earnings are estimated in optimal (advertising) levels, and you're probably breaking even if you're lucky. I may be a pessimist though-- some people must be profiting from this. Aside from manufacturers. 
I imagine the ones who buy these have some slick deal with electric prices.

Dude, you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your entire thought process. About everything.
You just asked me how you can guarantee that you won't somehow take a loss.
If I could do that-- I'd be the ruler of this galaxy.  
 
No such thing as a sure thing-- in life, money, gambling, etc. 
Bitcoins are not always rising...they're just higher now than they were at the start. By quite a bit-- but that's all relative. Could be a million dollars for 1btc in 10 years. Could be 0$.

 Mining for fun/learning is an okay thing. But don't expect profits unless you've got a cheap electricity kW/$ rate. Your hardware will probably be obsolete by the time you've paid it off. 
For hardware wallets, the consensus is probably Trezor. I own one. Simple to use and verified as a safe method of offline storage.
CoinBase and Gemini have been fine by me. You'll hear horror stories, but they often get resolved with a little poking.

The thing driving the value of bitcoin up and up and up is the universal adoption of bitcoin. The more adoption, the more value.

I'm in the learning stages, myself. As a 29 year old IT Administrator. I see the vision, I see the potential, and I urge you-- chase this if it is something you're interested in. 
Along the road of my life, I've spent thousands of dollars on businesses that have gone flat. 15,000$ here...3,000$ there...perhaps it's not all a waste-- but a learning experience. 
As a 29 year old, who is very much a child at heart, to a 14 year old seeking advice-- I would say go for it. The next 4-5...hell maybe even 10 years of your life are going to be up and down, regardless. This could be huge. Go for it. Don't buy the xbox-- buy a bitcoin. Even if it fails, you'll be better for the experience. I would give this advice to my son(if i had one). Stay curious, and read. A lot.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:43:44

@_date: 2017-07-18 18:35:24
The problem with comparing these things, is that bitcoin is drastically better than both cash/debit transactions. 
The adoption could be rapid, and SHOULD be rapid. That LONG way to go could be traversed in 10-15 years, where other major advancements in money/value trading sometimes took 100s of years.
With the internet being what it is-- our adoption rate is quick. And grows faster with "revolution".

There is a road we are all following now. 
August 1st, there will be two roads. A bunch of people will follow each one. 
Your coin will be on both(if you own your own keys and keep it offline).

Same with bitcoin. Move them to a wallet you control and think about investing in a hardware wallet for additional security. Trezor is pricey at the moment depending on your total btc ownership--but if it's anywhere near 1 coin, you need to get a hardware wallet.

It's always going to be worth the same as fiat-- relatively speaking. Whether .0001BTC is a dollar or one-hundred dollars. The only thing that changes is how the majority values the BTC. That's where people need to adjust their thinking. 
In a market that will only contain 21 million whole coins, what will the market value those @ it's full maturity. 
I personally don't see it being worth LESS than 3000 per BTC when it settles. There's a reason a lot of smart folks are talking in the 10,000$ USD+ Range.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:55:36
Okay-- you took the joke well. Here's the real brief of what's going on from my perspective. A realist approach.
This is not an investment. Plain and simple. It paid off for plenty of people-- but this entire cryptoverse is speculation. If you believe in the technology and believe there will be broad adoption in the coming months/years, then the value will rise in accordance. 
Your goals in investing will also help dictate what amount you should consider losing/gambling/speculating with. 
I'm not 10,000$ deep into crypto yet-- because I'm fairly new to the scene. I'm instead, purchasing over time at comfortable amounts, which in turn is keeping my average price paid down(At this point in time...i could have just as easily wound up paying more by doing this...again-- it's gambling/speculation).
You can think about this as a short term gamble, or a long term gamble-- where the you can lose it all...make a few bucks...or be ready for a mansion...

Initial purchase: 1800$ - 1BTC
Sell @ Peak 2800$ - You have 2800$ USD.
Price Drops to 2200$ per BTC, you can spend that 2800$ and get 1.27BTC.
Your initial investment of 1800$ Was once worth 1BTC, but you've turned it into 1.27BTC with active trading. Accuracy is key.

That's a little hard to guarantee. But the one thing you can know is that by having it on a Trezor, you'd be capable to participate in any activity that WOULD preserve the validity of your coin for eternity.
Trezor filled with 5 BTC, sits in the dresser for a year, and suddenly there's a development within the community. Something changes. There could be a need to upgrade the Trezor hardware-- but you'd be able to transfer from old Trezor to New Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:43:59
Based on my experiences, I'd say that maybe 2/3 at best will get through the verification process. 
I say that not because it's difficult--but because many of these million are probably just flocking to something they saw on the news. Not a lot of dedication or passion for the system. 
Many will be dissuaded because it's a bit harder to navigate than PayPal. Sad truth. 
Saying that...2/3 sounds very optimistic.

There's a bitcoin visa card(contradictory, I know) which allows you to keep a balance on the card of BTC-- and it works. 
That solves the day-to-day transactions. Gas for your car. Coffee. Lunch, etc.
