So you think your average end user should be able to run a node on a Raspberry Pi, yet you also think the average fee for a transaction should cost....as much as a Raspberry Pi.  Makes perfect sense!

So if SW2x is the longest chain, has super majority of hash power, and majority of business support it's not bitcoin?  Lol so weird how bitcoin seems to be whatever you say it is at the time.

Early in bitcoin's history Satoshi implemented a temporary 1mb block size cap via a hard fork.  You are currently using an alt coin of the original bitcoin.  Why are you doing that Luke?  How come you are opting to use an alt coin instead of the real unlimited block size bitcoin?

Oh well I guess transaction fee averaging $7 a few days ago is no longer a problem then!

The punch line is you think free health care exists.

Shouldn't the fact that bitcoin is so susceptible to DoS attacks right now be enough reason?  Should a global payment network see mass adoption if one person can take the fees from 10s/byte to 500s/byte or is that expected behavior?

Your understanding of what bitcoin is, is probably 10x better than the average poster on this sub.

They are overly concerned about block chain size and can't put their ego aside to compromise.  Their position is that end users should always be able to possess the capability to run a full node.  Bitcoin was not design or intended to be used this way.  The intent was to run nodes in datacenters, all the businesses in the industry would run them.  There would still be thousands of nodes and it'd remain decentralized.  There's no reason not to have 4-8mb blocks right now.

How come these posts don't come out of the woodwork when fees are 400 satoshis/byte ?  Perhaps you guys have an agenda to push ?

Same people who are developing bitcoin now.  Minus the cry babies who rage quit cause they didn't get their way.  Probably a vast majority will continue developing.  Bitcoin has had good dev's rage quit before, and it will happen again.  Segwit 2x will become bitcoin and the community will move on.

And once that is done, why are their still delays?  It only needs to be done one time.  There's no excuse.

It's an acceptable explanation for someone who is clueless or an apologist.  For the other 99% of people we recognize there is no congestion what so ever to speak of and a cold storage transfer happens one time.  Coinbase is lying to your face about congestion, demonstrably so, and you're here being an apologist for their lies.

And this is a normal and reasonable statement from one of the pillars of the bitcoin community commonly recommended to all new users?
