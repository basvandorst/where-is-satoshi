Looks like those BTC Futures from BAKKT are doing their thing....it’s headed down.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:43:11
Because they have more guns than you.
@_date: 2018-09-23 04:33:11

If GameStop works do it, these banks are useless. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:56:35
These people are idiots, I guess the brand spanking new $1 Trillion bank note will save the day!
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:43:03
$50,000 someday, whenever the manipulation ends. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:17:45
Most people just don’t understand the game. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:44:55

@_date: 2018-03-03 02:31:14
If I were dumb enough to loose that kind of money I would keep my mouth shut!!! I’d be too ashamed! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:38:49
And a lot of pockets were lined up in DC
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:25:21
Exactly my thoughts!
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:17:22
Take your money out of these banks and go to a credit union.

Give Iran a bunch of dollars as it looses value and tell them to shut the hell up. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:09:20
They have a worthless currency so what’s holding them back?
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:56:05

The bar has been put so low that now everyone thinks it’s going to “moon” when peanuts are thrown to them, that’s the mentality of a broke man. Just the way they want you.
