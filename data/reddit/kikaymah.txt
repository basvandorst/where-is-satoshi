Fantastic lessons learnt, some I’ve learnt myself and perhaps some other lessons I’ve still to learn.
Thanks for this list!!!

Hilariously, I think we posted at the same time on the same topic :D 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:44:30
Hmm. Link works for me

Security. Make sure you’ve got your private keys.

I was thinking that, I doubt it’s 12 million.

Just tried to cash out for cheap bitcoins - to no avail.  Next week or two should be interesting and a good btc buying opportunity. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:42:45
Bitcoin has been there for at least 2 years.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:46:23
Will they? Wont they?

I suggest you get a SSL certificate for the website. Its currently insecure and even though not launched, you're asking people to input their email address into a unsecure website.

You guys are probably right but needs must at this time. 
Need to get some cash flow in this time, hate to pull out but I'm feeling like now is the time for me to take profit.
I've never cashed out just bought so now I want the best possible low fees method of btc to gbp. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:03:40
What are the fees? Could not see them on the site ��
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:37:40
btcjam tried it, it failed.
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:23:49
Well CoinCap.io is missing out coins, like btc. So kinda pointless now. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:50:49
I can't help but think there's more to bitcoin's cap than that of Reddit forum members. The market cap is 50billion, so surely bitcoin redditors do not account for 50 bil. I have to disagree, there are a few institutions dipping their toes in by now. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 18:35:10
Agreed!

Could be right, I’ve also a feeling this is pro bitcoin cash app. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:12:10
Yeah those shitcoins don’t interest me. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:06:07
Thanks! I need a new way to track my portfolio. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:39:28
Not sure which one but it was a green one in the middle of two roads

This ain’t my first rodeo. 
Bought the dip. 
I see the same patterns the market has experienced a number of time since 2019. 
As a long term buyer hodler I believe this is just the start of another cycle. 
Last time it went to top the market was crazy, Uber drivers and front pages of newspapers were featuring BTC. When I see or hear bitcoin price speculation from from 2/3 unlikely sources (mainstream media / noobs chatting or asking me about it)  - I believe this is the top.
 
I’ll buy each time I see 10/20% daily dips. I feel we are where we were in early 2017 again (based on mainstream awareness and numerous other factors like volume, google trends, and other data sets) with the entire cycle up to $20k+ is just beginning now. 
$50k possibly 100k top ����

This Roger guys seems like a right C***
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:47:00
Heavily monitoring this!   
Seems to be some resistance around 5700USD and buy orders being triggered. Perhaps it's the bounce we were waiting for?

Not cool. Following for updates on this as I was about to do this for the same use case.

How about travel to somewhere you can make a simple localbitcoins transaction? Say Berlin or Warsaw ?
