5BTC = $1500? Where can I buy Bitcoin at that rate?

Thanks :)

Thanks! Fixed! 
Web developer, not writer ;)

My own website was one of the first I made (about 3 years ago). It's not something that I'm proud of. But as a freelancer it's hard to stop looking for work to upgrade my own stuff.
Several of you mentioned my website as disappointing, so obviously I need to do something about it soon.
Thanks for complimenting my hair!

Instead of begging for bitcoin like I originally planned, I thought that I should instead encourage you to be wise with the wealth that you have. 
You are now capable of helping a lot of people and literally changing the world if you play your cards right.

Actually I have a very high amount of respect for my clients. I'm rather confused why you're being so hostile, but here goes my attempt to explain myself.
I started out knowing very little about web development. Unlike a lot of people, I was born without the ability to create awesome websites from scratch. But web development is something that I genuinely enjoy  doing.
My earlier clients knew that I was new to this, and I was very open and honest with them about using templates. I would send them a few to consider or I would ask them to pick it out. I would only charge them for the time it took to install it, place their content, and if necessary, customize it.
The websites pictured in the link I posted are NOT templates. I stopped using those. My clients receive a completely custom design which I then build from scratch into a website.
I really should update my own site, but thank God I've been too busy to do so.
I don't know how to be more clear on this: I USED TO USE TEMPLATES, NOW I DO NOT. 
I think you will be hard pressed to find a designer/developer who didn't start their career using "unoriginal, pre-built, oversold templates".

Am I too late? To the moon!

All of the websites shown there were hand coded by me. Some will look like templates because there's a template for everything.
@_date: 2014-05-30 23:15:37
My site is in dire need of a re-work :) 
My old website and some of my old clients were built on templates. However, as stated in the ad, I don't use templates anymore.

They are built on WordPress, but I don't use pre-made templates. I built those from scratch.
Also, responsiveness used to be a paid add-on so not all of my older clients used it.

There are several reasons off the top of my head.
PayPal charges fees significantly higher than the cost of bitcoin.
I've read many horror stories of people getting their account and funds frozen.
I also have faith in the future of bitcoin and want to integrate early.

What a fun way to look at bitcoin I don't have any way to use a VR app like this, but I wish I could. Good luck!

I guess we learn in different ways. Thanks for the criticism. 
I think the big thing to take away from this is a need to update the portfolio on my website.
@_date: 2013-06-27 16:46:39
Doesn't look like it &gt;(
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:12:11
THIS is the kind of answer I was hoping for. Thanks a ton!
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:53:11
I did the same thing. Felt pretty silly.
@_date: 2013-05-29 03:11:22
This looks promising as well. Although they're sold out for now :)

This is exactly why I purchased $300 gold plated monster anniversary edition hdmi cables. To protect my television from viruses.

Really cool idea. I haven't even considered offering bitcoin as a payment option! Must look into this.
@_date: 2013-05-26 13:01:00
This sounds awesome! I've been looking for talent, and bitcoins just make it so much better!
