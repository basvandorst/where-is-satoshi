Because Bitcoin ain't rigged at all...

I will vote no. Let the last stable fiat currency destroy itself as well.

The Gnome foundation will never acknowledge the trademark "Gnome. I don't get why they named their product Gnome in the first place, if they are so in tune if the open source community.

I'm against pro-antidisencourangement. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:51:22
Lol, this had to happen at some point, and will happen again.

I just laugh at people thinking that Bitcoin adoption is slow due to its complex nature and having no ease of use. Thanks for posting this!

Just be patient, a Crypto Protocol handling storage, computing and bandwidth at the same time will come. Maidsafe and Sorj will be great, but this one will unify them all.

Just pick a project you like and ask the repsective community for what work needs to be done.

I think there is only one solution to this: Have our voice heared in the comment section as often as possible and apply r/bitcoin community pressure!
It does not matter what will be used, but "Blockchain" should certainly be disencouraged.

Either second market, or, depending on your location, there are broker services in specific countries.

Is this:  real money?
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:08:05
Yep, we need a Bitcoin dicitionary as a point of refference for all these term.

Ninja-Mine? You mean a lauch that was not announced in a timely manner?
@_date: 2014-11-22 14:41:38
You can even get rewarded in Crypto for World Community Grid work. Ripple has a give away (or had I am not sure on this one) and Gridcoin is a coin fully dedicated to verify and compensate any kind of BOINC work, World Community Grid being only one of the many BOINC projects.

I'm very familiar with this movie ripe story. In what way is a ninja mine different from a premine? 
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:49:00
Just move 4.0 into a direction that leads away from TOR and you will be fine :)

I am not going to tell what "the most secure route us", but rather what appears as a sensible method for me and achievable for non programmers. The problem with mixers is: the output amount remains more or less the same. This means you can still rediscover your address. I  think the most feasible way is therefore to transfer them to an exchange, and exchange them to Monero. Transfer them to a full monero wallet and dice them up unevenly into two or more addresses. Monero's blockchain is fully anonymous and untrackable and uses a design that was actually proposed for Bitcoin by Satoshi himself. After this create a new account on another exchange and transfer them back to your new account. Then send them to two or more unrelated bitcoin addresses (time them a reasonable amount of blocks apart for full tinfoil mode) and enjoy your untainted, fungible Bitcoins.

This just in from Bitstamp: "Thanks to the recent crash, we thought about eliminating volatility and found, that if the amount of transactions is diverging towards zero, volatility actually goes down.
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:28:15
That is nothing else than practical mathematics.

ninja-mine Element of premine and premine not Element of ninja mine?

As if the Bitcoin Market would care about anything.... 
There is only the pump.

Obviously there is still not enough despair, lets go lower.

If you trust online services to handle your money, that is fine. if you want something better, use a paper wallet generated on an offline machine and only use it once to store and once again to liquidate.

Lol, Gridcoin has this since about a year. It's all about the pump.

Credit card approval, like with the thousands of stores that are currently accepting Paycoin?
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:27:36
After those standards you would never be able to verify absolute integrity of the code. It seems like you are able to trust nobody with this. If that is the case everybody would have to check and build the code after every pull request themself.
So, yes it could still happen, but I believe current reviewing standards to be high enough.
Do you have any reason for this hard distrust, e.g. why do you think more than 51% of devs have an evil agenda?

Openbazaar ist NOT a darknet marketplace. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:30:13
Maybe I over-read something, but couldn't a Testnet be setup for this BIP?  There still seems to be quite some time left for this decision, since 0.10 and 0.11 have already been mapped out extensively. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:56:21
You should read up on Keyhotee and IDCoin. They have some very interesting concepts going on.
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:21:19
Seriously, did you just propose that "something sneaky" would find itself into code that has been forked and starred more than 6000 times on Github,  is watched by more than 800 entities and is led by a multi-developer team who need consensus (and often don't that's why we have this discussion in the first place) to change anything in the code, never mind the official releases?

To sum it up: Waeeeeh!
The guys building this are doing so as their part time side project, some of them are google devs, or work for other software firms. Given the complexity of the software they are still doing one hell of a job.
