Tether cannot be cashed out for USD

I agree with you, just like USD, CAD, Euro, it is a means for people to buy and sell. But it does not have backing or security like the other major currencies do. I am not disagreeing with you or this concept. But this is a peer to peer device, when is it going to be priced high enough that you're gonna call it quits and sell off?

I agree, but the only way that this price sustains itself is if no one takes their money out. I believe there is going to be a price point where people will just sell off. That's when it will come back down to earth and have the potential for a stable currency. There is a reason the USD does not have price movements this volatile. 
I agree with you in the sense that if the money keeps coming in that it won't go down, but that just isn't practical.

Haha, I don't think that's what volatility means.

Also has the chance to come back down to $10. Nobody really knows, it's mostly speculation that drove the price up. Would I buy bitcoin now? No, and anyone who has studied financial markets would agree. But if bitcoin was trading at a stable rate? Of course I would. The majority of bitcoin users are not using it for purchases, but as an "investment" vehicle.

I believe that it will only go up up until the point that people say "enough, x amount is too expensive" and eventually sell off. Just like any other commodity here is going to be a point where it is too expensive or too overvalued to be considered a safe or smart investment.

I understand the power of bypassing the absurd fees, and I'm all for it, but I think it is ridiculous that I have to pay $1000 for one btc, when last week I could have payed $500. I don't see any sort of price stability. Volatility is extremely high and I wouldn't short it simply because it can reach $5000! And if it can go up extremely quickly, why can't it go down?

Once it reaches a stable price point, I think it can be a very efficient form of currency, but the rapid price movements make it seem uncertain. Simply from an outside view, I don't own any bitcoin and if I did I'd hope it would continue to rise.

Value IS the amount someone is willing to pay. That's what I'm trying to get at, are you willing to pay $1000 or even more for bitcoin? 
Edit: iPad typing sucks.

That's how prices fall, I mean if no one is willing to buy at $1000, you lower your asking price. That's a component in the lowering of different commodities and securities.

Past performance doesn't merit future results. Btc is very volatile, just as easily as it goes up it can come down.
I'd like for it to be stable because then it can be used properly!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:59:32
That is exactly what I'm trying to get at. It is a great system with loads of potential. I'm just not a fan of the extreme increase in volatility.
