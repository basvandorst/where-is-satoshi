I actually don't see any issue at all having large mempool and backlog of transactions. It is an auction after all. If you don't need your TX to go immediately through and can wait you can pay very little, looks like 10-15sat/byte might be the sweet spot for slow transaction and quite slow like 80sat/byte. If you need your TX **now** then it's fine by me it costs a bit a more :)

Only 3%?
We have started years ago calculating it as roughly 4.5%, with all the hidden fees etc.
For the past year it's been more like 5.65% tho! There is so many damn hidden fees.

I also bet that many of those who hold significant number of bitcoins relative to their adoption time have many wallets, cold and hot to spread around the risk.
For a early adopter each of these could hold few tens to even hundreds of BTC each, and for new comers this could be 1-2 btc each

the moment we scrap the history of blockchain, it is not a ledger anymore. The full history is required to know all the balances.
Light wallets OK, but not for full nodes. Certainly there can be "checkpoints" where full balance history at block x# can be stored, and semi-full node does not need anything prior to that, but full nodes are still necessity to check and validate the full history.
There is no way out of it; Physically impossible. You cannot have verifiable history without having said history stored somewhere accessible.
What you linked is completely different question infact. Every phone does not need full blockchain even now.
Full node's job is to verify the entire history and to make sure everyone is following the rules. Without full access to the full blockchain this job cannot be fullfilled; Simple as that.
Scaling has no single magic solution. Block size will need to increase eventually, but that is not an excuse to skip doing *actual* scalability solutions.
Micro transactions should not be on main chain at all after LN is a reality, then you can do all the micro and nano transactions you want to your heart's content. No need to burden rest of the world with your 0.10$ equivalent transactions :)

Hub is merely something to which a lot of users connect to. They don't need special powers to be hubs.
Look up on how the people developing this actually envisions how it works, LN Hubs is a very real thing and will be on-demand. This is because the hubs need to be 24/7/365 reachable and reliable, and they need to fork out a lot of their own funds to make sure they never go to 0 balance to keep the channels open.
They will also preferrably need to be very fast and have optimized routing, so that every user does not need to build their own routing table so to speak.
Instead of single user opening many channels to different place, that user only needs one channel open to the specific hub, and the hub maintainers make sure they have shortest possible paths for fast transactions.
Making those 2: Reliable 24/7/365 and Fast, is what makes demand for hubs, and they will be a very real thing. They might operate identical software as the end user, but that is only part of the solution.

Wrong. Most of the backlog is due to spam attack. So just increasing block size will result just doubling the backlog at half the TX fee each initially and then it will begin to ramp up again.
LN works at orders of magnitude difference, like 3 orders of magnitude estimated but can be many many times this. I think there is some physics which will practically limit it, but 1 transaction per second would give you 7 orders of magnitude over the course of year.
Once you got your channel open, no amount of spam, even if the mempool gets to several petabytes with TX fees 1BTC each will not hinder your payment channel once it is open.
With LN active with wide adoption, spam attack will have very little impact on day to day use.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:11:49


A fundamental change like that is extremely unlikely to happen. *and* not only because *every single* miner out there would be presenting united front against that move. The implications are much much more than just that.

That is a tremendous change, and something this valuable you don't simply do that kind of changes nilly willy, not in 1 year schedule out-of-the-blue. You don't do "this might be nice" type of stuff at all when you are playing with billions. Even stuff we can mostly agree with (SegWit) is a tremendous task to get accepted.
Proof-Of-Stake is also untested at this kind of scale, and it would concentrate more gains to those with most capital (well, that is not that much different than right now in regards of miners). So far no issues with POS but it also has not had as tremendous potential profit to break so far.
and how about all the mining equipment and operations now worthless? How much do those people support the operation of the network and valuation? At least a lot of people will be out of jobs, or looking at reinvesting at tremendous scale if they want to keep supporting bitcoin. Or skyrocketing valuation of some other SHA256 based coin(s), which will cause it to surpass bitcoin's valuation. Do not underestimate the vast resources these people have, nor their role in securing the network.
A lot of Bitcoin's value is derived from the effort required for POW. That is essentially the bottom pricing -&gt; Miners need to recoup their expenses, and many will outright refuse to sell below their OpEx if not OpEx+Capex. Moving to POS will remove the bottom of the valuation.
A tremendous change like that would also heavily undermine the trust &amp; faith into Bitcoin as a system, cryptocurrencies as a whole infact.
Purely POS also would mean full nodes would be those verifying the rules and securing the network. There is only ~2700 currently. What would be stopping me from creating 1 000 000 full nodes and taking over the network? Nothing. and before you doubt it: I have the means to do this as well, only scarce resource limitation i would have is IPv4 addresses. Otherwise it would be a simple matter of scripting automation batch jobs for couple of hours tops and then executing that, and i would have 1million full nodes to overtake the network.
Right now we have a delicate balance of checks. Moving to POS from POW would remove one of the checks and imbalance the whole system.
All these negatives, for what positives? Uhm, those too lazy to run mining operations could profit? yeaaaaaaaa....
And making the network less secure as well to boot, potentially killing bitcoin altogether? Yeap.
I'm not even the right person to ask what all drawbacks and cons there would be, i don't know the intricate details nearly well enough to know all the implications.
*And* before you say stopping that energy expenditure for mining is a net good, think about what that all energy is accomplishing, and compared to traditional banking how much energy is actually being used. The "little" electricity used for mining is *nothing* compared to the expenses of operating a traditional banking system. Especially if you start counting the number of people required to do that.
Bitcoin's job is not to be energy efficient or green for the planet, it's job is to establish a truly free and open system for storing value and exchanging that value. A monetary system.

You can always close a channel at will.
Only time will show how it will form, but i think some hubs are going to emerge no matter what, even on your description, even if that hub is a joe average who just happens to keep his computer 24/7 on.

@_date: 2017-12-04 12:00:32
If you look at internet at large enough scale (any ISP or multihomed network operator) it starts to resemble mesh network as well, albeit manually built and configured for most part.
Each hop in a network route might have dozens of connections, and it has a ruleset based on which it chooses a route for you. A single hop might have dozens of potential routes to reach the target destination.
That is also why you sometimes have different routes between targets depending on the direction the packets are traveling in. Node A to Node B has route A, and Node B to Node A has route B.

Note that GTX 1070 also costs roughly double to buy compared to RX 580, and RX 580 is essentially last gen compared to GTX 1070.
RX580 you can pick up for 200€ (240$) and 1070 for 390€ (470$), power consumption is about the same. Even if we use inflated price for RX580 of roughly 250€ (300$) breakeven periods are: 122days for RX580 and 147days using your values.
However your revenue per day numbers are incorrect, they are currnetly 2.12 and 2.54$ respectively, which yields 142 days and 185 days for breakeven respectively. Again using RX580 inflated pricing.
If we take Vega 56 in comparison which is highly more efficient and costs roughly the same at ~490$ it hashes 1900h/s on monero at almost same power consumption of around 130W per GPU we get some magic numbers: 5.17$ per day return and 95 days breakeven.
Also heavily dependant on tuning what power consumption and hash rate you get.
I don't understand this fetish with Nvidia GPUs for mining. AMD has always been the top dog here, no doubt about it, infact, quite on different level. Even CPU mining with AMD Ryzen is profitable at this moment, a Ryzen 3 1200 can do 300-320h/s, and Ryzen 7 1700 620, which yields 0.87$ and 1.69$ respectively each day at costs of 100$ and 290$ respectively, with breakevens of 115 days and 172 days respectively. Power consumption is on level with RX580.
HELL, i did the maths for HD5970 too a couple weeks back, and *even that* was profitable, a beast of GPU from 8 years back, gets some 600h/s and consumes like 300W.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:26:11
So your solution would be to OUTSPEND the spammers? Who are also the largest miners, maintaining the network :)
LN does not solve main blockchain spam, what it does is move the everyday ordinary transactions out of there, leaving the blockchain as a settlement network.
The effect for fees for the end user is same as lowering fees by roughly as many times as you use a payment channel on average. So if you do say 50 transactions over a payment channel, your fees will be ~1/50th + whatever the LN hub(s) want.
Your transaction will go through in matter of seconds even if the blockchain backlog is tremendous.
Due to this, there will be less activity on the blockchain, and therefore less incentive to spam it as well.
It still costs the spammers to spam, they only get a portion of them back. So the solution would be more pools &amp; miners who don't spam, who eventually reap the benefits of that spamming attack and the spammers loose out.
The current spam and attack situation is not something you would solve by increasing the blocksize, infact, that would drive out legitimate users in the long run. It would also INCREASE the amount of spam on short term by lower TX fees. It would cause the full blockchain to grow, which means less full nodes, longer processing times.
There needs to be smart solutions, like LN which solves the high individual transaction cost, transaction processing time and scalability at one swift move.
Increasing block size is completely counter to this, it's a dumb brute force attempt. Simple maths shows brute force does not work out. 1MB blocks without segwit can handle 6 tx/s, with segwit about 12 tx/s @ 1MB. volumes like Visa needs something like 7000 tx/s, or 583MB block size, 84 000MB per day,  29.24TiB per year (about 32TB in HDD sizes). This would mean that in a single year the amount of full nodes will be reduced to a few hundred max, and bitcoin would become essentially centralized over the span of a decade, even counting in the cost decrease of storage capacity.
320TB in today's rates costs about 9600€ to buy, and that is very low end cost without redundancy, you want 10-20% redundancy on top of that, plus the servers, electricity and network capacity. 320TB blockchain requires over 1Gbps of bandwidth 24/7 to transmit **one** copy. (practical limit per 1Gbps is 310TB at server level, network level it's even lower, to maintain network quality you can only push through an average of ~60% max).
Even transmitting single 583MB block will take 6 seconds @ 1Gbps, and considering you have probably dozens of connections per full node which all need it in the 6 seconds we are talking about 40Gbps+ servers at that point. Full network propagation for a block can take more than blocktime would be.
In today's market average costs this would entail a cost of about 2000€ per month, for 1 single full node at 10Gbps. 40Gbps to the server is largely unavailable and is bound to cost in the 10 000€+ range.
To be safe, you would want your servers to be connected at 100Gbps and then we are talking at such a magnitude of bandwidth only handful of companies in each country can afford. Even the bare minimum cost is too darned great for anyone but the largest operations who's primary source of revenue is bitcoin related (exchanges, miners).
Blockchain pruning at node side would not solve that neither, full copies still need to be maintained and pruning would simply centralize it even more.
Things like bcash which does exactly this is purely an attempt of centralization. Their dream probably is to overtake BTC as the "gold standard" and they would be **happy to** to spend even 500k $ per month to host full nodes if it meant they were in 100% control of it. It would be in some ways only marginally better than the banking system we have today, and in many ways tremendously worse.

DNS is just name service to connect IPs to domain names, nothing more.
Lightning network is more akin the internet, it is a network of networks kind of. a LN hub has several "local" users, users connecting directly to it, akin to Local Area Network. LN Hubs connect to each other and route payments between users of these different hubs, like many connected LANs, or a WAN, or what is generally thought of as internet being.
Your connection is to your local ISP (same as LN hub), which connects to other ISPs, and form a routing table to get your data packets to and from any users via multitude of networks.

@_date: 2016-01-18 22:44:06
I was talking about both.
So if 1MB tx takes a lot of time to process, and larger could function as DOS for the network, increase block size BUT do not increase maximum TX size.
and if the processing power required to verify large TX is exponential, so should the fee be as well; Otherwise DOS is still possible at relatively ever decreasing TX fee.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:21:01
Those are valid points.
But how about if the limit per tx is set to say 500kb or 1mb which is current block size limit, and just the total block size is increased?
Ofc, in your use case, one could argue that making multiple + high tx fee to make sure as many are included in the same block as possible.
Further, does it really matter if they are say 3 blocks apart at worst?
To future proof, block size could increase to double every 2-2½ years, making sure that the storage &amp; processing power required would constantly get relatively cheaper (SSD capacity increases 2 fold every 1½ years, processing power roughly increases 2 fold every 1½ years, magnetic drives should drop to half the price per TB every 2 years)
TX size limit would raise slower since i understand tx processing gets exponentially slower as the tx size increases, so perhaps every 4-5 years.
That would future proof it for use cases we can foresee right now, and if TX maximum starts at 1mb, no new limits has been introduced, only increased.
Tho, miners will start to rely on TX fees so perhaps the size should increase slower.
Btw, couldn't miners choose which TXs to include, so they could still opt for say 1mb size only the top fees TXs taken if it becomes too inexpensive per tx?

Here the govt does opposite, so many example late into the fiscal year depts go spending crazy to spend everything they got remaining to stuff they don't need, just to see the money gone so their budgets don't get cut for next year.
Over spending is the game. If they budget something for thing X, they cannot pay less than that, it will be disapproved then, so they often even ask for higher prices because otherwise they need to have the purchase re-approved! They over budget for everything because it's so hard to get re-approved for a purchase with any price difference at all from what was approved earlier.

Wow, never heard of him before. This speech tho; Exactly my line of thinking.
Just a few days ago i was called coocoo conspiracy theorist, in relation to crypto of all possible things, as i was complaining about lack of privacy in Win10 (it's shipped with spyware afterall).
The scale required is enormous, and he is exactly right, just making the blocks larger will solve nothing, and there needs to be layer-2 applications, later on layer-3 and so forth. We see some of that already, glimpses of such. Exchanges for example are layer-2 applications, they do the exchanges internally, at a tremendous scale for each one of them. Imagine 80% of the world using bitcoin for their daily lives, and you soon realize why Bitcoin core is *extremely* conservative on every change, and how stupid these Bitcoin Cash etc. stuff actually is.
Imagine that 80% using bitcoin daily, in 20 years, there will be 9billion of us. Imagine the required scale, average 5 transactions per month right now, daily 50, add microtransactions and we are at 500, then nanotransactions or essentially streaming money and everyone needs to do 5 000 transactions or more monthly. 7.2 billion, roughly the current world population, will mean 36 TRILLION transactions each month or roughly 49 BILLION transactions per hour, 821.92 million per minute, 13 698 000 per second.
Simply cannot be solved by increasing block size. That being said, block size does need moderate increasing. Something like half of the average storage &amp; computation power increase rate, or perhaps even a little bit less. 10-15% annually, adjusted like difficulty every 2 weeks just a small increase to alleviate the layer-1 congestion even ever so slightly, at a minimal cost - we will still eventually reach equilibrium where every single phone can run as full node.
On the flip side - if 80% of world population uses bitcoin in 20 years - the value per 1BTC will be, according to Metcalfe's law, 9 600 times higher or about 76 800 000USD per 1BTC - not adjusted for inflation nor increase in use - based on everyone doing just 5 transactions per month. Add a few orders of magnitude to adjust for that.

No, they would become free to do something more productive :)
That's what i mean with people's lives: So many are tied into maintaining that system, imagine everyone employed directly and indirectly by the banking industry.
Certainly some people would remain doing similar stuff, but large portion would be free'd up to do more positive things.
Things like security guards, super high-end ultra expensive datacenter setups with a lot of oversight would be replaced by mining farms which are incentivized to do things as low cost as possible, most of the oversight people, physically ferrying cash around etc.
Banking industry itself uses in this fashion tremendous amounts of energy and resources.
Let's say miners get 100$ million a day in returns, it means on stable market they would be spending 50+$ million a day on maintaining it, some of which is electricity, some of which are other resources. That is 3 billion $ monthly, which is still peanuts compared to how much costs the banking industry has in resource consumption.

If he had even a toy gun with him he would have been shot down. The assault team was told he is armed and dangerous terrorist, and likely has a bomb. He is lucky to even survive that.
"bandwidth provider" You do realize how ridiculous you are sounding right now?
They are **not** bandwidth providers, they are network operators who sell a multitude of different connectivity options such as DWDM, P-t-P, VPN, MPLS, Dark Fiber/Backhaul services. One of the many ISP to ISP services is IP Transit. On B2C and non-telecom industry B2B there is connectivity services such as xDSL, Cable, Fiber etc.
Banking institution paying an Tier-1 network operator to block certain types of traffic is not just prohibitively expensive, but illegal in so many levels. That Tier-1 network would be setting themselves up for failure. Do you have *any* idea how many devices, 3rd parties, physical installations it takes just to get city to city connectivity? Did not think so.
Ok, then lower tier, more localized operators -&gt; these might have central routing points where this could feasibly be done, but in europe, you are seeking to grease hundreds if not thousands of separate operators, never mind breaking EU law.
They have tried the make it illegal common things before, it was called prohibition. Read up, see what *actually* happened. Hint: Did not work so well.

Every problem is a possibility in disguise.
Bitcoin will face many kinds of attacks, but the intrinsic value cannot be drained out, and as long as that is the case it will survive. No matter the type of attack. At this point we (Bitcoin users) are practically a hive mind, and only 1 of the swarm needs to come up with the right solution, there will be a debate and consensus formed. The more serious the threat, the faster consensus is formed.
Because of the monetary incentive, miners *will* find a way to maintain the network *guaranteed*.
There is no world power which can attack simultaneously 10s of thousands of locations in every possible jurisdiction on this planet - It will be a drawn out battle; Time during which solutions, to which they will be hard pressed to find any weakness to attack against, will be presented.

Yea if they even attempt this bitcoin price will go up significantly. When they start dumping is where the market strength is tested, they either make a shitload of profit or shitload of profit.

They force price up and start dumping but bitcoin price plummets, they trickle buy back in -&gt; They get bitcoin profit -&gt; rinse &amp; repeat. They are only at a imaginary loss as these morons probably do not understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin and they would themselves short the earliest possible moment, but if there is even 1 smart guy deciding and they hodl a bit ...

You missed the whole point of my comment.
My point was that USD/EUR/JPY etc. is far from stable, and on longer time scale it does not work. Say BTC remains the same on USD, so 1BTC=8000USD today, and in 20 years 1BTC=8000USD. Which 1BTC buys more, today's or 20 years from now on?
Today's because 8000USD is probably then worth the same as 15 000USD today. Average income in 20 years is probably in almost the exact same proportion higher, and most commodity prices as well.
So even if 1BTC = 15 000$ in 20years in above example, it would be worth exactly the same when doing your groceries (or lambo buying)

nope did not imply that neither :) Only that it may look like that.
FIAT inflation and BTC deflation are 2 completely separate things not related to each other.
What it does however is that in terms of absolute numbers against USD it may look like BTC is hyper-deflationary, because USD looses value so fast, but BTC supply does not increase at the same rate and with any growth acts deflationary (same number of BTC divided for larger number of people, and all the lost wallets etc).

Obligatory car reference:
Americans added cubic inches to car engines, 5+ liters was the norm. Cheapish engines to build, but gas guzzlers.
Japans increased efficiency to the point a 1.6l engine would have more power &amp; torque than a 5+ liter gas guzzler. Engine R&amp;D cost high and sometimes manufacturing more difficult, but consumption is low and engines are extremely reliable.
Similar concept here, except everyone has to pay for the fuel, and everyone will eventually need 2 tankers worth of fuel or not going anywhere.
In this instance question is block size: Simply increasing blocksize is easy, but once the blockchain grows you never can go back. Increasing blocksize at big adoption rates we are quickly in a situation where everyone who wants to host the full blockchain needs hundreds of terabytes of storage, and in practice house it on a datacenter due to bandwidth restrictions.
Thus bcash centralizes to the rich few who can do this. They also did some funky stuff apparently with difficulty calcs for their own benefit. Bcash development is solely under the control of Roger Ver, Jihan &amp; Associates, 100%. So is the website, subreddit etc. they want 100% control over Bitcoin, so they made Bcash as an attempt for hostile takeover. Also Check asicboost, they wanted to continue abusing that bug to gain more hashpower.

Bitcoin never was currency to begin with, so not a problem.
However, Bitcoin is just as much money as before, and even more so. The volatility is actually decreasing, just look at the history.
Transactions still get processed at fair TX fees unless you let services like Coinbase decide the fees for you. Generally very low fees, and always faster than a wiretransfer. *Certainly*, there was a spam attack driving fees through the roof lately, but Bitcoin is still in it's infancy, and these issues are being solved.
TX fees are a necessary evil, otherwise there will be no miners in future to process your transactions and securing the blockchain. There will probably always be those services which multiplies sensible TX fee by 20, 200 or something silly, like Coinbase does. But you will still always be able to do sensibly priced transactions as well. It is only a matter of how long are you willing to wait for the transaction to happen.
Insider trading exists on "normal exchanges" as well, the form of it is different however, there is legalized insider trading even.
The day Bitcoin becomes a currency like all the FIAT is, that is the day Bitcoin looses most of it's value. Currency does not equal Money. Those are 2 different things. Currency is not backed by anything but empty promises, Money is backed by something. In Bitcoin's case, mathematics. USD used to be money, but as it's not backed with gold anymore it is a currency.

Something a little bit like BGP could be could be done when the time comes for optimization.
Node A announces what he has available/his routes to nodes he is connected to, either all of them or preferential (ie. tell Node B only about local direct connections, but for Node C tell all potential)
Node A has preference list for routes for outgoing transactions which prioritizes certain "next hops" over others when choosing, and basic choosing is hop count / latency for outgoing
Oh well, i have NFI yet how LN works, but i do hope to be running a hub(or hubs) when the time comes :)
Thinking about that one thought crossed my mind today, i would think latency is going to be important with this, ie. streaming, and quick micropayments you want the payment to go through in under 1 second, and as there is routing, lots of hops, processing and multiple back and forth communications a 100ms latency may amplify 10 fold or more easily (as an example, TOR *is* kinda sluggish)

Classic cars. They tend to only go up in value.
Think Ferrari Testarossa for example.
Just look at many of the rich people how damn many old classic cars they have simply stored away.
I have witnessed this myself for much cheaper cars, the Corolla E7 and AE86 platform. First car like that i bought was like 100€, second was ~800€ but in better condition and larger engine - now that same car would go for 2500-3000€ *if* you can find one (original TE71), haven't seen one for sale here in couple of years. First built car like that i bought for something like 2500€ (trade in) - today the same car would fetch around 7000€. These days even a shitty example tends to go for 1500€ or more.

As someone who works in storage as living, and storage being 1 of 2 most important aspects for the said living, i must say that 400 GiB annually is a lot. 170 GiB is a lot to keep in embedded &amp; low end devices but not on issue on almost any full computer.
~50GiB growth annually is already quite a bit if maximum diversity needs to be kept - but at least it is linear, where capacities grow exponential.
Tech is not quite here yet where every phone could have full chain, but most laptops can, and all desktop computers can. A few more years at current 1MiB blocks would be a welcomed reprieve, but we have no such option, and as such a middle ground needs to be formed.
So why the hell is this not set as annualized growth rate like all other storage in the world?
Some growth rates, just back of my head are: Internet traffic 25% annualized, and storage capacities grow as well like 10-15% annually on average (there are jumps, sometimes a bit less, sometimes a bit more). These are compound rates. This means we could set forth 5% annualized compounding growth, make the increase every few weeks to stabilize it a bit, and the end result is that over time more and more devices can support full chains.
To get started, we could get add a one time increase of 256 KiB or 25% to 1280 KiB. Add capacity to the chain every 4 weeks (every 2nd difficulty adjustment), but only if 80%+ utilization is reached.
Fairly simple rules eh?
Each increase accounts for rougly 0.33% so 1280 -&gt; 1284 KiB -&gt; 1288 KiB etc.
Annual ~5% average would yield in 3 years: 1280 -&gt; 1344 KiB -&gt; 1411 KiB, or max growth of -&gt; 64 GiB -&gt; 67 GiB -&gt; 70 GiB.

and a large operator could set his own hubs around the globe and manually open channels between them, knowing that his/hers own will always be fast (no extraneous latency due to poor links or bad routing) and in the hopes of having more users for those nice TX fee profits :)

You have never heard of VPN, OpenDNS, TOR? Do you even know how the internet functions?
The more gateways are put in place, the more there will be ways to circumvent.


*facepalm* seriously dude, ofc they have rudimentary, but the level required here, you have no idea what is involved. Detecting *encrypted* algorithms from **every single damn connection** and **every single packet** is *extremely difficult*. Why? At the Tier1 levels you cannot even get enough internal I/O speed on a server, never mind enough to process it at that level.
For a single 100Gbps connection you are going to need several racks worth of servers just inspecting those packets. This all adds latency, and what do not customers like? Latency!

This article made me realize that perhaps we should not put the most important value on Bitcoin as USD/EUR/JPY etc. but more like % of annual average income.
Right now 1BTC is what, 15-20% of average annual income?
USD/EUR/JPY are heavily inflationary, where Bitcoin is deflationary. 1000USD buys less tomorrow than today. As such Bitcoin will keep breaking value records each year, but how much does it's purchasing power ACTUALLY increase?
Or should we measure in Lamborghini's? ;) How many bitcoins you need to buy a lamborghini, today some 15 (120k $)? In a decade 0.5? At which point 1BTC will probably be worth 500k $ and as such a lamborghini costs 250k $. 
Now you see how hard it is to measure buying power in USD over long term :/

Chinese great firewall has always been trivialish to circumvent. It's like the DNS blocks, it only stops those who cannot be arsed to circumvent. takes ~2minutes, for newb maybe ~10minutes, or super lazy can just google and use a mirror/proxy if popular site
It only takes a little bit more effort to make work, as long as any VPN tunnel works it can be circumvented and it was never a perfect block to begin with. There just is not enough interest to make it autonomous and seamless for the end users.
VPNs are a whack-a-mole game i hear, and i believe there's even browser addons for chinese people to make it super easy to circumvent the great firewall.
All it takes is just a little bit of incentive.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:15:30
Yea more or less correct.
It gets even worse after certain size over time: It becomes impossible to have that much storage on a single server, or extremely hard.
I work on storage for my living, and the fact of the matter is that any feasible method for our operation we are limited to 450TB on a single server, and even that makes *zero* business sense to tie up that much into single server for performance reasons. It would cost something like 12 000€ to build that server alone. Largest sensible size right now is 120TB (12x10TB) with RAID50 giving 100TB.
1000 MiB is not sufficient for the high transaction volumes, it was hundreds of GiB per block at widespread adoption. 5000MiB per year is 250+ TiB, or in HDD capacities some 270TB for just 1 year. Couple of years that and you need 1PB for each one; Which means you need to build a storage cluster like Ceph. Then you can run off the same dataset multiple nodes for resiliency, multiple DCs etc.

Oh! I recall from some 6-7 years ago that it was spoken that it is essentially GUI limitation.
However, that does not limit subdivision if it is read as each byte representing a fraction, ie first decimal point is first byte, second decimal point is second byte etc. You simply add bytes to the end.
I am 100% certain that back then the talk was that BTC is in essence infinitely divisible, but for the moment limited as makes no sense to have more decimal points. This was back when 1BTC was worth like 0.05€.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:15:04
Yea those too! X)

@_date: 2017-11-24 01:22:20
Only time will show :)
I would still think there would be demand for stable 24/7 hubs which have fast connectivity - that way the end user has the least amount of capital tied into various open payment channels to ensure 24/7 reachability. I would think an end user does not want to keep many payment channels open.
Well operated nodes @ home can be quite stable tho, if you can get fast connectivity as well :)

You would never do something which would upset the users to begin with. Technical change does not mean automaticly upsetting the users.
This would need to changes from the userbase etc. only a stupid dev would force a change of behavior to the userbase.
I asked for a reference and you jump on to give examples, but why should i believe a random stranger on reddit with not a single authoritative reference?
Actually, i'm not even that interested in this particular subject. Back in the early days (~2011) it was anyways accepted as fact that bitcoin would be "infinitely divisible" at least to the tune of practicability and wallets were back then limited on the number of decimal place for practical purposes. If we start arguing about infinity we must face that *nothing* is infinite.

Only a currency is a very very bad underestimation. Bitcoin is so much friggin' more than just a currency.
To begin with, it's not even currency. Currency is fiat, not very good store of value. Money is excellent store of value. 
Bitcoin is trustless peer to peer system where everyone checks everyone else and everything is transparent, and no one can control it. It is enforced by maths. Anyone can do oversight on the system, and anyone can join and use it, across borders. It is completely neutral, a transaction is a transaction, nothing more. It removes barriers. It is a bank in your pocket. It is freedom and liberation from modern slavery (inflation).
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:26:14
mortgage def better because of the super low interest rates right now, just get a mortgage with permanent interest ceiling, and if bank says interest ceiling not possible swap bank immediately!
Permanent interest ceiling should exist, atleast term like 10years is possible.
Pay only enough from BTC investments that either of you could alone handle the mortgage payments shall shit hit the fan, does not need to be easy, just possible. Take as long mortgage as possible, 50+ years if possible. Interest ever hits skyroof use BTC and pay it off.
As for paying mortgage alone, using your wife as example: 25k $/year, assuming before taxes so 20k $/year tops after taxes.
That leaves a monthly budget of 1667$, and assuming need for transportation to get to work and back el cheapo car &lt;2000$ worth, cheapest insurance etc. probably winds up being 200$ a month (2400$ annually with repairs and fuel).
 * Food: 400$ is *more* than enough and works as general goto buffer
 * Clothing: 20$ a month/240$ annually (want more clothes? Eat less!)
 * Hygiene products and stuff like that: 30$ a month/360$ annually (again, want more eat less)
 * Electricity, Internet, Phone: 30$ a month/360$ annum (again, want more eat less)
 * Buffer &amp; Savings: 50$ a month (for the unexpected shit, stuff breaking and the like)
This leaves a budget of: 917$/month for house costs (mortgage, heating, occasional repairs)
Assuming your annual average is 100$ for heating monthly, and property tax 50$, we are left with 767$
for 30year mortgage that is 276 120$ minus interest, calc as 5% annually (tho you should get a mortgage with ~1% annual interest, but need some room to move!) so like 230k $ can be mortgaged.
But to avoid that shit happening, buy a little bit gold, like 10k $ worth and other stuff which retains value really well over decades; so not a car, jewelry is ok as long as you check you don't pay too much of a premium on top of the material value.
Also put a little bit spread out to like 10 different funds, that shit should average 6,6% annual, after upkeeps and what not you should see annual average yield of 6%+ when spread out evenly.
Total like max 50k $ on savings like that, rest keep BTC. That gives a nice 1-2 year transition period shall shit hit the fan.

@_date: 2017-11-25 11:41:49


This would be some upper level stuff, most people would not use this chain directly, more like hubs.
Let's imagine a world 150 years from now, we have settled mars, moon and research station on venus upper atmosphere.
You work on a research lab at Venus and receive your salary from earth, but send back to your relatives at earth.
Employer initiates transaction every 15 minutes to pay your salary to their Bitcoin blockchain hub, which then makes an exchange with Bitcoin Sol, which in return makes an exchange with Bitcoin Venus, and you receive your salary at 1.5-2RTT which is about 4-5 minutes later.
You have setup that from every 15minute block you receive from your employer you send back say 50%, and initiate a transfer to your chosen Bitcoin Venus hub, which then exchanges with Bitcoin Sol, and which ultimately exchanges with Bitcoin and your relative receives Bitcoin and you retain 50% as Bitcoin Venus.
You might even do automatic hedging against Bitcoin Venus exchange rate and buy a little bit of Bitcoin Mars and Bitcoin on each salary payment received.
In this case the LN network works exactly as advertised, moneys went both directions and the payment channels get updated and no need to close and confirm one for a looooong time :)
Once the hub between say bitcoin and bitcoin sol wants to confirm the sum of transactions your regular joe spending has already happened and money has moved, and it does not make a lick of difference that it takes 48hours for first confirm on the sum of the payment channel between the LN Hubs, no one but the hub owners would notice, only their tied in balances would need slight increase as they wait for 6 days for the 3 confirmations required, but they offset this cost by having a tinyest of tiny TX fee on each transaction between the chains :)

Once again, learn how the internet works.
If Tier-1 operators start controlling what *companies* can transmit, is the time US economy collapses nearly overnight. No i am not kidding.
Especially all the smaller network operators, good luck trying to get them to pay for your silly orwellian control shit. Hell, even from the big ones some are happy to goto the courts to defend their customers.
If VPN tunnels are broken, then bitcoin would be goner too, and so would be internet pretty much as the whole, everything needing any security would be swiftly disconnected. It would be apocalyptic level event, down to level of things you would never think off. House heating, electric grid in some places, traffic lights, grocery stores, all credit cards etc.
Correctly setup TOR cannot be distinguished from other "legitimate" traffic.
Any effort to block certain encrypted connections will quickly snowball to the situation of nothing is encrypted, hence no internet services neither. None of which. If US tried to even pull this off, rest of the world would probably start blocking any packets originating from the US and route around the US.
Internet is a organic, living thing, which is built, maintained and operated by like minded individuals at the lowest level, there would be rebellion.
Prohibition would be in comparison like a lullaby. All the occupy protests, 2008 sub-prime crisis combined would seem like a lullaby in comparison. Attempting to block encrypted transmissions would be the equivalent of imminent complete collapse of society.

Never mind that *every single* altcoin is called altcoin as in alternative to bitcoin, and *every single* altcoin is primarily exchanged against BTC.
The brand recognition of btc alone is so overwhelming that even this bch shit is like a flea trying to take down a mammoth, no matter what the bch valuation is right now.
Just check the difficulty increase for miners, all that hardware needs to be paid off, and if btc tries to go lower valuation miners will simply start hodling and establish a lower boundary price, which is probably going to set somewhere around electricity + hardware ROI &lt;48 months + overhead (rent, staff etc.) even at it's lowest. (ie. how the majority of hosting industry is right now) Miners will struggle a lot if that happens, but few will most definitely stick it out as the potential gains on the other side are gargantuan.

Imagine if you could mint any number of new bitcoins into your wallet whenever you wish. You'd be wanting to create 20million BTC from get go but as not to crash the market you do it at roughly the pace more fiat investments is put into bitcoin, ie. at the rate bitcoin value is raising to avoid crashing the market and getting the biggest pile of cash.


Having money instead of currency is their nightmare. Currency they can control, money requires something (ie. bitcoin, gold, silver) in equivalent amounts or in other words: No more just printing.
That is actually a way bitcoin could become mainstream: issue paper money with hidden private keys for the same amount as the denomination.

If they think a DDoS is going on, ofc they will will blackhole an IP. Standard operating procedure. Tho, these days business has moved more on the side of mitigating (eating it up, filtering) the DDoS traffic.
In your example, using UDP to transmit big data files, they had no business doing that, they may have been mistaken but with a call they should allow it again, otherwise they are most likely breaking the contract. Infact, it is very odd that an Tier-1 would even be monitoring in that fashion *unless* they were grossly overselling and their backbone got congested as a result.
But again, you lack the necessary background information to even understand what you are talking about.
Same goes with Tor. look up onion routing and onion sites. Also neither bitcoin nor tor allows a single person to know all the exit or entry nodes. You will need to spend effort to get the whole list.
But alas, you think any tier-1 can block them all, you are very mistaken, no one has control over the internet at that level, no one. No one can shut it down.

@_date: 2018-11-07 16:19:13
Got to do the maths i guess.
Assume each one uses 100Wh each morning doing those tasks, that is 4MWh each morning, 20MWh each week, or about 81MWh each month.
Tho i have no idea how much people use on average when showering, and how much energy spenditure is on heating that water to a comfy level and pumping it. Could be just as easily 1kWh. Which would equate to 810MWh each month, so nowhere near close CURRENTLY.
Might've been true around 2014 :)

Doesn't mean that's not the case in future. Around here it is getting more and more common constantly to have 1Gbps to home. Also does not mean you need to target lowest common denominator. With that thinking, the blocksize should be 1/10th of what it is today, just so that the 14.4k dialup users, the few that there are now, would be able to host it.
Hell, new buildings and renovations can prep for 10G to the home these days. 10G is being already setup for apartment building connections (then rises as 1G to the apartment usually). Fiber is being laid out to every single building in urban areas. One company here is advertising 50€ for 1G Fiber home connections! This all is happening here, and we are FAR from the leader in these things.
Hell, i live in a place where they have no incentive to have fast connections, no fiber etc. Yet i have currently 50Mbps, and the technology is already capable to 100Mbps (commercial reasons why they are not giving it as 100Mbps) - for 20€ a month. 4G you can get for &lt;10€ a month and has something like 50/50 speeds.


That seems to be an optimization issue.
To extend this, then blocksizes today should be 1/100th, so the 14.4k dialup user is supported.


You cannot compare HDD to bandwidth as Oranges to Oranges. Also, there is other costs like electricity, rest of the system etc.
All of this, including bandwidth your lowest common denominator already has. But there is simply no hope you can make the 14.4k dialup user to keep up, and targeting that means no more bitcoin at all. There simply is no bandwidth to do that at all.
You must set realistic goals. Not every joe average is interested in full node, not every joe average's full node needs to serve as much as the top dog, and not every joe average (with that 14.4k) needs to be able to run full node.
There simply has to be certain bottomline, and in something like this functionality of the whole chain trumps the need for every Joe Average with their shitty connections being able to run with the largest operators. Nothing works like that, that is a pipe dream.
Or do you expect to be able to also watch highest quality youtube vids on a commodore 64 with that 14.4k? Nope. Youtube would not exist at all if they targeted every vid needs to work with 14.4k modem and say a 386 based computer.
Technology goes on, technology gets improved. New things, new nice things especially, you just cannot expect to run on old hardware.
What's next? Every mobile phone needs to be able to act as a full node?


So, now it is ok to buy hardware just to run a full node?
Why isn't it ok to to spend that 200$ on a hard drive? Why isn't it ok to have a proper internet connection? But it's ok to buy a dedicated machine for it, sans the hard drive?
That's a double standard right there.


TL;DR; No one knows yet, but that is driving factor for development, and current estimates are in the 50year range with today's technology. Shorter fiber runs (think urban areas) will have far longer lifespan.


I am not, i just don't get expect a 14.4k dialup user with 90s era computer needs to be able to run a full node. Only those interested in tech who surely have already fast connections, large drives etc. Not every grandma needs to (or wants to) run a full node.
If something can be done today, it for sure as hell can be done at a fraction of the cost in 10 years.

Seriously, you are making bandwidth the issue. It is not. at all.
Say you have 10TB data set -&gt; you can serve it 1x per day on 1Gbps line. You'd be surprised how little 1Gbps bandwidth (actual, business, IP Transit) costs.
Your full node will not constantly be doing 100% speed serving blocks - at all, not even near. It is more like 1:1 -&gt; get 1 copy, serve 1 copy on average + growth of full nodes. Let's make it SUPER unrealistic and say 10 copies.
So if blockchain increases 1500GB a year, that is 1500GB or 10x of that is 15 000GB. Something a 50Mbps connection can do in a month.
100Mbps only servers are getting rare... Even cheapest ones can do 200Mbps upload -&gt; 1 week to serve blockchain data for the full year's worth.
Both are exponential figures certainly, in relation bandwidth cost might get more expensive to blockchain size. But blockchain has obvious limit to it's growth (when every single transaction in the world is done with bitcoin...), where as bandwidth costs bottom is only limited by technology and investment. Fiber cost constantly goes down because it's getting paid off. Eventually when there is fiber everywhere, no need to build new fiber, and existing fiber is 100 years old - how much do you think leasing a single fiber costs? Pretty much nil, if there is no need to build new one it means there is tons of fiber dark (unused). So bandwidth costs will always keep getting smaller, even if no technological advances are made ... But those are being made. Today operators commonly use 100Gbps, and can multiplex 32-64 channels per fiber. 40Gbps is being phased out from some datacenters etc.
So bandwidth costs will keep going down. Blockchain can only grow so much. Unless you assume population growth 80% annually as well ;)

MANAGED vs UNMANAGED is a huge difference.
SoftLayer sells fully managed, afaik Rackspace too.
But these are very very basic skills you need to setup bitcoin full node, if you are not using it as wallet especially.
We have been selling 4TB machines for 30€ a month, but that model is right now unavailable via us. 6TB machines are around 45€ a month (inc. VAT 24%) from other providers.
Most merchants i know of use a 3rd party service... Well all of them do :)
There are exchanges, ATM providers and such who don't obviously - but if they can muster the cash for building or buying safe ATMs, it's not a significant cost to host 5TB+ server.
**EDIT:** Blockchain today is what 160GB or so, a 5€ dedi is sufficient for that. Worst case sceneratio was 5TB requirement in 10 years, my estimates for 5TB in 10 years are around 10€ mark on low end dedi. on a large system say 200TB, the 5TB equivalent is going to be like 1€

As i read it here is my thinking:
Email Users:


This is disappearing really really fast.


What i propose would eventually solve all these issues, especially as the pricing will be market dictated :)


Hard to ID Really Urgent: If flexible pricing and client providers decide to implement, this would be solvable as well (except for the part where an user marks everything top priority, until explained it costs money!)
Email providers spy: Due to new revenue stream, we might see a new golden age of email service providers. Providers who do not rely on spying to get bills paid and to make a profit :)
Same goes for the advertising thing.
Email providers section.
PROs, well spying is one business model. You can actually buy email service as well. Usually comes with your internet access too. Places like OVH sells you forever email service for really cheap too, but they'd like to have rest of hosting with them as well.
CON: Costs Money, no direct income
It doesn't cost *that* much these days due to performance getting better overtime. However, what costs mosts is Antispam &amp; Antivirus, those are the most taxing steps on the whole process (I once built a scalable email service, 90%+ of hardware requirement was for SpamAssassin)
False positives: With proposed system false positives would decrease as well.
Decades old protocols &amp; technology: Yes and no. Protocols yes, technology to handle said protocol can always be made better. Being decades old i would say "battle hardened" - we know how it works, and the base protocols do their job magnificently **as long** as all providers follow the f***ng RFCs (looking at you Microsoft!)
"Overpayments can be made to flag urgent emails – or as a very easy way to send someone money. "
Did not think of that - the system could be used for money transfers as well... Now that would require deeper than just MTA level changes i would presume. But how would you turn your e-mail account into cash then?
Could we cryptographically make sure an given e-mail address gets a decided public address, but only that email address can have that private key somehow seemingly magically? .... I guess the system could e-mail the said private key!
Now let's assume on top of everything discussed, there is a special TX Type: Money transfer
Instead of going to the MTA daemon, this would create new key pair wallet, and the private key is e-mailed to the recipient, and recipients client has money features enabled (or manually imports to a wallet). Say subject is "MC COD: TXUUID", enabled email client could add this to their balance automatically and keep that mail hidden from normal inbox  OR if not enabled you would see this.
Sender either has similar support, or initiates on another wallet / 3rd party service which after payment received automatically makes that email etc. :)
However, this system could already be built with any current coin :)
Any text as recipient address:
Doable, this has already been shown to be done with namecoin ages ago :)


Not enough, it needs to be even profitable actually for the main user group which needs to adopt it.


Complete decentralization would eliminate all email providers.


How would this be solved? Users will keep typoing just like before.


No adoption, too much hassle.


Still needs to be stored somewhere.


Absolutely no adoption what so ever.


Above more than negates this, super expensive adoption (think of the billions of $ spent on developing the current system)


So who makes the biggest investment (3rd party developers making new email 2.0 server and client software) would not get paid at all if most of the money goes to the end user.


People will still create addresses like 7h1515my3m41l4ddr355pl345353n7m3m0n3yz cos' it's cool :D
On other note you will also have addresses like john.doe27564


Not going to happen, a legion of tiny chinese grinders will farm that out. They work for even less income than this would provide (See WOW accounts for sale for example). If they can make 0.10$ per hour, they'll do it.
Thanks for sharing. The idea to pay for the blockchain's development came from this, the voting funds perhaps should be directed to dev team / dev organization.
I think the MTA approach is still the way to go: The least amount of people needs to converted for the highest end user adoption ratio. A single sysadmin deciding to implement this may cover 1000 end users.
End users does not even need to know what happens on the backend. Infact, i *bet* most end users could not give a f**k what happens on the backend, as long as they receive their cat pictures chain mail, and can reply to all LOLOLOLOLOOLOLOL punishing the MTA :D

Just because Satoshi thought of something back in the day, does not make the decision invalid. He originally did make it 32MB size, but to stop spam limited to 1MB.
32MB max block size seems like a good idea.
Just because satoshi (who ever he is) said something, does not mean it is a bad idea - we would not be having this argument without him.
Satoshi clearly was ahead of the times, and had a clear vision. It is not religion, it is matter of recognizing who knows the subject better than you do.
No one is arguing that got to be wrong because religion of Hawking? E=mc2 has to be wrong because religion of Einstein? Wake up.
I am sorry if your self esteem is such low that you feel threatened by recognizing there are people much smarter on a subject than neither of us are.


So keep block sizes at 1MB forever and use centralized 3rd party services to conduct transactions? Then bitcoin would horrendously failed.
And as the facts are: 32MB blocksize was then - but it would be ample, actually probably too large still to date. We would need to annually increase, and once we hit that 32MB we should have a clear idea where to go from there. It is not the ultimate end of all, but it is what we could do *right now*, and *solve the issue for what is in Internet Time a millenia*.
What we should, and must honor however is the base vision: It is the sole reason bitcoin has the adoption, popularity and value we have today, whether you understand the core principles or not. A lot of people understand the core principles tho, but i do suspect they are minority and even from that minority many have alterior motives which is not the benefit of us all, but their own benefit (banks for example).
But what we should **not** do is dismiss an idea just because it originates from Satoshi.
Here is about the 32MB blocks by someone else:

Did you happen to check my username?
I do **actually** work in dedicated storage servers, infact, our 2 main expenses are: Bandwidth, Storage.
Today's prices would be 5€ a month like i said on the edit for the current blockchain, and in 10 years time the 5TB equivalent is going to be around 10€ for dedi server, and on a larger server 5TB worth of storage is more like 1€
It costed us about 840€ as of yesterday to put 24TB worth of RAID5 redundant storage online for the drives. Yes, i actually just yesterday bought a batch of 8TB 7200RPM drives for building some new servers. This price is dropping about 15% annually (less now thanks to Duopoly) for HDDs. For SSDs price halves every 2 years, so about 25-30% per year cost decrease.
SSDs cost right now 210€/TB -&gt; 10 years from now it is 6.56€/TB - seriously. Why? Follows moore's law (well observation), but cost decrease is postponed by DEMAND.
*Bandwidth* is actually quite expensive, you are correct there, but bandwidth price on wholesale IP Transit decreases annually, and home connections get better. 50Mbps upload on 4GB LTE is possible. Wired connections are currently lagging behind, but we are seeing ever more 1G and 10G whole building deployments.
*Geographic gaps* If you target the lowest denominator, you get the lowest denominator. We cannot assume people in Uganda or Zimbabwe have the same resources we westerners have. You cannot thus target every 5$ cell phone (that's pretty much on average what they got) can run full node - we would not have Bitcoin for 10 more years.
No one said we should make it happen today, and all of sudden just force the blockchain to be 5TB in size.
But seriously, storage nor bandwidth are not the issues for long term. and we should not expect every Joe Average running full node on their dialup connection - all we need are the tech savvy users. That's plenty of decentralization. Just like not every Joe Average is mining.

If we go for [32MB block size]( we could do 100 TX/Sec.
Price of BTC would be 1000x at that time. 8 years to that point.
If we just continue the 54% growth annually we could fathomably have a situation where TX fees are nil == no security on the blockchain.
8 years is very long time on this scene. I would personally suggest we go with the linked method first and see where we are in 8 years time - either continue doing 54% annual increase, or make the blockchain self balance this as well, say to on average 1% of the TX value as TX fees. Blocksize limit checked every 3 months or so.
Some of the TXs are very cheap still, some are expensive, based on priority etc.
Further 1% TX Fee on such a high value, high TX counts is immense amounts of money. Even if you count volume to grow linearly and not exponentially: today 1 463 740 000$, round it to 1.5 billion -&gt; 48 billion -&gt; 1% -&gt; 480 million $ per day in TX fees to miners ... That's a freakishly much!
How about blockchain total size?
If we get 30MB average block then we get about 1 540GB growth per annum. Not really an issue. Certainly you cannot run a full node on every mobile device, but those who want to run full node it is not an issue.
In 10 years time at that growth rate we may see maybe 8TB total blockchain size or so. Not really an issue at all.

Perhaps mail should be taken by MTA first, and then MTA just holds on to see confirmation of payment, or even just announcement and accept it at 0 confirmations (if the other factors you said seem legit)

(420GiB * 10)+160GiB = 4360 GiB. Single 5TB HDD at that time ought to cost something like 40$ or so.
SSD should be around the 30-40€ mark as well for 5TB drive at that time.
 
Not irrelevant data use, but not really expensive neither. Leased servers will have substantially higher cost, the norm still to date is 2TB drives for el cheapo servers oO; (el cheapo = 40€ or under).

Market cap is irrelevant in this case: 2/3 to 3/4ths premine / ICO. The DAO crap as well.
That means every 1$ push to increase it's value does the work of 3-4$
Volume is likewise artificially inflated by the ICOs (do not know the mechanisms to this, how it happens)
It is centralized control as well. There is a reason why big banks are endorsing it -&gt; That very same control. They can mint however many more they want.
Given those facts, they could be also trading between themselves to inflate volume at minimal cost to make it seem larger. For banks putting down 1 billion $ to endorse ethereum they can ultimately control is nothing, it is completely peanuts. (see how much they are putting more money into circulation currently...)
ETH flash crashed, there was even an order for ~3830ETH @ 0.10$ a piece which got filled at GDAX.
ETH is also buckling under the TX load, combined with this flash crash just shows how thin the buy wall is ...

**Bad Actors**
Actors like Microsoft tend to drop silently e-mail, no error messages or anything, and this is very tough to solve, there is no means to check user got their e-mail all the way to their inbox.
However, there are signals for such given sufficient volume, occasionally you hear ramblings about email not going through etc.
MS services makes it really tough to make sure your e-mail goes thru, with anything more than 1 mail per day like of volumes. They have their validator thingy/complaint thingy which seems to do shit all.
Many blacklists does not make this easier neither, some RBLs will list your mail server if it resides even in the same /20 as a spammer (one of these f*** up lists is by default on all *NIX systems, and some trust them like gospel!)
Maintaining an OUTGOING mail server is stupid hard work these days. Which is what we attempt to solve here as well, you should be able to just setup your email server and be assured your email reaches.
To that, we could use domain voting, by "burning" (check [proof of burn]( ) coins. It's inefficient but it's something! (or we could redistribute those coins as "TX Fee" type of arrangement to miners as well!)
Each domain would POSITIVE and NEGATIVE voting. When a outgoing mail server admin notices this domain is not accepting valid email, they can send X MailCoin to the VOTE BAD address with TX message of the domain in question.
The owner of said domain could then vote POSITIVE to counteract this, so someone like MS could spend 40k $ to vote positive to counteract their nasty habits. But they would have to spend the money! What burning all those coins does is take them out of circulation and thus increase the value of everyone else's coins.
**So what should all this voting do then?**
I think it should affect the % of the payment they receive vs what is considered TX fee for the miners.
The worse their reputation is, the lower % they get, with bad enough rep they would get 0.
Standard could be 50:50 (all that storage is super expensive afterall), perfect reputation could be 95:5 and extremely bad reputation 5:95
Votes either side should count 1:1. Vote 1 positive, Vote 0 bad, would count as perfect, this means for domain admins it makes sense to spend immediately some coins on their domain. Say Vote 9 coins positive, Vote 1 bad, would mean 90% positive, and thus 81:19 distribution (90% of 90).
This voting could then mean that even if sender is not using the system, receiver could use the voting data to set antispam bias for the domain. Meaning that even if the *"bad actor"* does not implement this system (they could see it as irrelevant, their spam flag % still so high), receiving servers would know this is a bad actor and adjust spam score accordingly.
Good reputation should give a benefit to senders as well, and infact might be more significant here. Does there need to be financial incentive ON TOP of the spamscore benefits? Mail out "TX Fee" (let's start calling it reputation fee, as not to confuse it with actual TX Fees) split back to sender under the same reputation rules? Makes sense, doesn't it? :)
If done so, a good reputation host (say 95%) sending to bad reputation host (say 35%) would lead to this:
 * Sender spends 1 coin
 * Receiver bad rep so split is 36.5:63.5. Receiver gets 0.365 coins, Vote Fee is 0.635 Coins
 * Sender has good rep split is 90.5:8.5. Sender gets 90.5% of this 0.635 coins back resulting in 0.574675 coins back to sender, 0.060325 coins to miners
 * Sender spent in practice only 0.425325 (+TX Fee) on this mail instead of 1.0 + TX Fee
**But that's manual ... quite worthless ain't it?**
There could be a spamassassin component to autovote positive when particularly low spam flagging scores are noted. Mail service providers could implement voting as part of their "report as spam", "flag this spam" routines etc. largely crowdsourcing the data gathering.
Yea it costs, but you could vote with fraction of a coin too, making the vote be small, but a signal in any case.
This would eventually built up as a kind of *trust system* for e-mail, where reputation of domains sending &amp; receiving email is built up overtime, and MTA admins have a vested interest to keep high reputation.
developing this blockchain we would need to supply examples for automatic voting, but not necessarily implementations for such autonomous voting. Let the people decide how they want to do it, and implement it the way people find it best :)
**Flip side of the coin, bad bad actors?**
Yes, someone could spend a lot of money to downvote you in order to cause your domain issues. A competitor perhaps. But such is life, at least they have to spend money to do that.
And if the coins are similarly pseudonymous as in bitcoin, someone doing that could potentially be tracked to the source.
To fully counteract 1000$ spent by attacker is near impossible, but someone wanting truly positive rep would need to spend 10k $+, so this would be too effective of an attack. There needs to be some border lines where rep is considered "best possible", or different kind of maths. Maybe Positive Votes minus Negative Votes = reputation 1, 0, -1 meaning positive, neutral or negative. Nothing else?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:08:30
Oh! I forgot to add about pricing and market economies!
The pricing i gave is just an example, and what i think is fair, but ultimately the market decides that.
There will be market forces: Speculative, Investment, "Tool" (mail senders and system users), and tolerance for spamvertising which eventually say what the price is.
Daemons etc. should have means to set their preferred pricing dynamically, as well as the default static "1 MailCoin per Mail out".
Recipients should as well be capable to choose to accept and prioritize as per how much the mail is paying. This could give rise to mail priority as well, where sender chooses to pay more, or less, depending how important it is.
For example, businesses could send 0.5 MailCoin for newsletters etc. while normal welcome emails are 1 MailCoin and super criticial important (ie. login details related or invoices) could be 2 MailCoins each.
*WHICH* is what brings another of those "nitty gritty" details which would need to be sorted out: What if the recipient still decides to not deliver the email? (There was some *bad actors* things i were thinking about, voting with wallets basicly, still forming it tho and the ideas are a bit elusive still)
End users could then filter their mail based on priority, or mail clients could add just a tiny color indicator of priority (think as tall icon as text is but only 5px wide or so, which has green, yellow, red coloring based on priority or something like that).
But these priority stuff is just things something like this makes possible, and this project should leave things like that upto application developers to decide :)
Markets will decide the price over time, we may end up in a system where each e-mail costs 0.20$ each, which i am not against, all that means very very little irrelevant email. Or we may end up with system where each e-mail is worth 0.0000001$ making mail system just as horrendously broken as before :(

I must have missed this, what did they do?

Still reading it, but i think sender always paying, receiver getting paid accomplishes exactly this task.
Sure the Joe Average never sees this income (unless their provider chooses to), but it's mainly the sysadmins we need to get behind this idea.
Hell, when you get paid, sysadmins may just implement this on their companies without telling anyone nor asking permission, if anyone ever asks "it enhances security, less spam gets through" ;)
Unfortunately, in a project like this, getting devs paid directly without fundamentally breaking the system or biasing might not be possible. Perhaps vote payments should goto devs? That's the least biased i can think of.
Registrars: They could sell an addon with the domain: 1) Positive vote to begin with 2) as soon as setup, send some "MailCoins" on their way. No need for exchanges or wait for incoming emails :)

This would be the default mode of operation.
This would essentially be a blockchain by sysadmins for sysadmins, in almost all cases.
Not many people run their own mail systems

"Blank slate" is the main issue with attempts so far. We have a system which used to work right now, and could again if this damn spam and bad actors issue gets resolved.
The backend software (MTAs etc) might be a bit legacy feeling these days, but they work, and they do function :)


Indeed, it is very hard to send coins to john.doe right now. Unfortunately, outside of the direct scope of what i propose here.


My initial thoughts some years back ago were similar, except the both parties get paid bit. Unfortunately this would not work, especially if those were newly minted coins. We could make it BotsSpamBotsCoin then :D
Just make a vast spammer, spamming your own servers and earn :)
Second, and biggest would be the extra TXs, even with the minimized TX message sizes i proposed the blockchain would get very large as shown.
Encryption of the mail itself would be outside the scope of this as well (requires client modifications to be secure from the email servers itself, no adoption will happen. email server to email server communication has already been secured ages ago)
When you simplify things, and make them minimal, you gain scalability. Keeping things simple also makes dev work easier as well.
Quite simply, i am an sysadmin tired to the ever continuing fight to get our email through, and the ever increasing mountain of spam. now we get even spam to our helpdesk ... through googles filters! All the while our legitimate mail is routinely being dropped by hotmail, and now even google has started to exhibit silently dropping email, and there is literally nothing more we can do anymore :( We already follow every single best practice, and even the "nice to have" and "should help a bit" things, along with long term reputable IPs, and even a pool of outgoing mail servers to make per outgoing mail server volumes lower etc etc. Quite frankly, we are loosing a lot of money because of constant delivery issues. and even putting money on the problem is not solving the issue.

There's almost no similarity at all
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:59:00


that's exactly what i do \^_^
"It's just data" is what i tend to say. Here we can leverage CPUs and RAM to make the physical storage smaller (or a miner could opt for non-compressed too for faster access), and turning the scalability issue on it's head -&gt; making it an advantage (avoiding ASIC mining and centralization of power)
Apart from the cryptographic things which i have no clue about, i think scaling is going to be the majority of work on the backend.
Most important work is however ensuring mass adoption (tutorials, tools, easy installers etc.)

I said in 10 years time (the worst case too) it would mean 1€ extra cost monthly. If *THAT* is prohibitively too expensive for you, perhaps you need to look at your business model.
You are assuming 0 technological progress in 10 years. 0 progress on access speeds etc.
World does not work like that.
Neither does the worst case scenario happen. A lot of things need to happen for 8MB block to happen.
The storage and bandwidth simply are not issues, and that should not stop from blocksize maximum increase at all.
FYI, i don't like this whole NYA and SegWit2x issue, to me it seems like attempted power grab. I prefer Core SegWit + slow increase of max blocksize to 32MB as described: 
Even 32MB blocksize will not be an issue, 8 years from now when that is possible, even if all blocks would then be 32MB (Which they are not) -&gt; 1642GB growth per year. Anyone who really wants to run full node still can. 2TB SSD should be priced in 9 years after all only around 15€, and if you cannot be arsed to invest that, then you should not complain about the blockchain size.
