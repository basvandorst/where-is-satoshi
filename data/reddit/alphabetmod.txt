Ah okay that makes sense. Thanks for explaining it to a noob, it probably gets tiring answering the same old dumb questions.

Thanks, I was looking for an answer to this as well. Once your identity is confirmed can you also sell up to 1BTC per day and have the money available instantly?

Sorry for the dumb question but I can't find what fiat means in the context of BTC?

So if all I have right now is a small amount of BTC in coinbase, and I wanted to sell, even though I wouldn't get the money back into my account right away the amount I would get would be the value of BTC at the time of the sale, right? If I sold at $700 per BTC and the market crashed to $300 per BTC while I was waiting on the ACH transfer, I'd still get the high sell price?

May be a stupid ?, but what if you're using a MAC?

I just purchased about .2 BC the other day and am very new to this… what is "running a full node"

Ok thanks, just making sure. I want to go about getting a wallet but it's so damn scary. I've been reading everything I can for the past week and still barely understand jack shit.

Mine shows a twitter feed.

This is the part I'm trying to grasp. I don't understand the wallets and the keys and all that, disconnecting from the internet and setting up these crazy passwords.. ah well thanks for the info lol.

I'm sorry for the dumb questions.. just ignore if you want… Why would someone want to download the entire block chain? What are the benefits?

What is two factor authentication… Like using a mobile app like authy? Also, by cold storage do you mean paper wallets? Sorry, noob here.
