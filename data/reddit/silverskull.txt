Stability is a good thing for a currency IMO.

That's a good point, actually.  Allows a user to report an error without telling them what actually happened.  This is a case where such an error code would be appropriate.
Just make sure that code is working properly.  I once got "Error: No such error found." from a MS application.

Hadn't thought of that, but it would be solved by either external storage of the keys or a TPM chip.  (Not a huge fan of TPM myself but it has its uses as long as it's not being used by the big corporations for evil things. :P)
EDIT: And actually, [there are a few possible solutions.](


My point was that I haven't seen any keyloggers that could fit into such a tight space - it would have to be specific to that laptop and I'm not even sure how such a thing would even be installed.  I would damn well notice if one of my USB ports stopped working.


Quite honestly, I'm not all that worried about centralized storage of Bitcoins.  The advantage is that the banks can't simply print more.

Go look at the Mt. Gox trade data for the last few days.  It did drop below $15 and almost hit $10.

Would be interested in one for the N810 if that's doable... all the new software is for the N900 and those of us who never upgraded are left out. :P

The "protecting yourself against them" bit was more important.  The idea is to not give anyone but yourself and possibly trusted friends physical access to your machine.  Mine is a Linux laptop, so the chances of me stumbling upon some malware that screws me over is exceedingly low, though I do try to be smart about it.
Encrypt your disk so they can't install anything on it in the first place, even with physical access.  (Admittedly I need to work on that bit; only my home directory is encrypted, but then I don't have many bitcoins and nothing else of value.  I'll be using full-disk encryption the next time I wipe and reload.)
And if you can show me a physical keylogger that can go unnoticed on or inside a laptop, I will be very impressed.


If someone empties your Bitcoin wallet you're screwed.
If Bitcoin gains some traction, I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin banks start opening.  Reimbursement is less feasible with a fixed supply of money, but maybe still doable.

I haven't looked at it in at least a week.  I have no idea what the current price is.
But I'm about to go check now.

The prices looked so cheap, but then I remembered we're at $14 a coin.

Right.  And they won't get anywhere with mine.  Two-factor authentication.
I'll have to watch out for phishing attempts but that's about it.

I love spotting these references. :P
On a more related note, I don't think the current Bitcoin market is very stable at all.  I could see a pump-and-dump killing the whole thing easily.  Of course, I could be wrong.
Many of those ideologues were early adopters who didn't put too much money into the system themselves and have tens of thousands of BTC sitting in their wallets.  They have the most to gain, and some of them will back it no matter what happens.  Some of them are greedy, some aren't.

Encryption, backups, and secrecy.  That's really all you can ask for.
But I agree, don't tell anyone.
(I'm not one of the bitcoin wealthy.  I have just under 5 coins.  Regardless, I keep them hidden. :P)

I keep my wallet, along with a copy of the Bitcoin client, in a Truecrypt volume.  As long as this volume is not currently mounted, anyone with remote access to the machine will not be able to use it - assuming they can find it.  (Not too hard, but I did put it in a somewhat obscure part of my filesystem.  Suffice it to say I didn't name it "Bitcoin.")


If you're being targeted for your bitcoins, yes, it may not help.  But having a backup ensures that you retain access to your account in the event that your computer is stolen.  If you're quick enough, you can empty your wallet before the theif does.  (And I see you covered this below, but even so...)
Also any problems with keyloggers can be solved by, you know, keeping an eye out for such things and protecting yourself against them.  You could get into someone's bank account the same way.

Reddit is open source though.
(Still hoping Google will do some sort of federation with Google+.)

[RetroShare]( does that, though it's a friend-to-friend network.
