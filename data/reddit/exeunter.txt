It's a term from management theory - when a worker intentionally causes harm by following an order literally despite the spirit of the order being evident.  It's certainly criminal if your actions cause harm, damage, or loss.  I'm sure there are plenty of examples of cases of sabotage relating to malicious compliance that are brought to civil and criminal court, but I'd imagine the difficulty is often in proving that the defendant knowingly acted with malicious intent (a good lawyer might argue the case that the defendant is just incompetent). ^^IANAL

The answer is (2^(96))!/(2^(96n)(2^(96)–n)!), where n is the number of private keys that you have generated (or 1 – that, if you meant probability instead of improbability).  This is exactly the same question mathematically as the [birthday problem](

Second what said.  Sweeping means to transfer the entire balance into a new wallet.  The easiest way to do this:
1. Go to  and sign up for a wallet
2. Click on "Import/Export", read the warning, and click "I Understand"
3. In the Import Private Key field, enter your private key that starts with "5" and click "Add Private Key"
4. In the prompt that comes up, select "Sweep Key".
Voila, Blockchain will create a new address and transfer the entire balance from your paper wallet to your new web wallet.  VERY IMPORTANT: using a web wallet requires additional security so enable 2-factor authentication:
5. Go back to "Wallet Home" and click on the "Account Settings" button, and then "Continue"
6. Select "Security" on the left, and choose your preferred method of receiving a one-time code when you login.  I use Google Authenticator, which requires you to download an iPhone/Android app.
7. Follow the instructions for setting up your preferred 2 factor authentication
8. Select "Never Remember Two Factor Login"
Never select the option to remember your password or two-factor authentication.  The only way to keep your account safe is to key in your password and two factor authentication every time you log in.
Good luck!

With a BIP38 encrypted-privkey card such as the one shown in my wallet above, the provider never gets the cleartext privkey OR the passphrase to decrypt the key - all they get is an intermediate code to generate the encrypted privkey that is obtained from passing the passphrase and a salt through a cryptographic hash function.
Of course, if you get a non-encrypted card, you're right - you are trusting the provider to have the proper security measures for processing and disposing of the plaintext privkeys, and that they won't use it for nefarious purposes.

Maybe someone who is an expert in technical analysis can explain to me how this is different from the Elliott Wave Theory that was developed in the 30s and still practiced today.  The wave theory is fundamentally based on fractal behavior of markets.
People have tried to apply the Elliott wave theory to Bitcoin in the last year or so to varying degrees of success.  It's certainly a controversial technique, and I am a sceptic when it comes to the utility of making reliable predictions with wave theory/fractal analysis.  It's easy to fit market behavior to a fractal/wave pattern ex post facto when there are many scales at which a fractal pattern can be applied.  In practice, it is highly subjective where waves begin and at what scale they occur.

I understand your intentions, but put yourself in the shoes of the vendor .  A mob descends on you, insists that you sell your products for a new currency that's unknown to you, you're deluged with a high volume of transactions that's you've never done before and are still learning about, and after all's said and done, you're parted with tens or hundreds of thousands of USD worth of inventory in exchange for a currency that you're not familiar with.
Adoption of Bitcoin in businesses is going to be gradual.  Vendors would want it that way - learn to doggie paddle in the shallow end of the pool before jumping into the ocean, so to speak.  Even looking at the Euro as an example - which was a mandated change that set deadlines when legacy currency would no longer be legal tender - businesses took several months to gradually adopt the new currency.

I abandoned that ship long ago.  Capital One cancelled my card a few years ago "due to inactivity".

Then nothing for a few years.  Last week I got an email from Capital One with some "Your eStatement is now available" linkbait (for my non-existent, closed account??) to a page where I can sign up.

Don't choose your own password to generate a wallet.
If you really want your money stolen, open a blockchain.info account and under Import/Export, put it in the passphrase you want to import.  Blockchain.info will let you try to import any passphrase - it doesn't matter that you haven't really created it - since cryptographic hash functions used in Bitcoin are deterministic, any service that's BIP 0032 compliant will always generate the same private/public key pair from your passphrase.
But seriously.  Don't use your own passphrase.  Choosing your own passphrase is *specifically* disallowed in Amory and Electrum, because it is insecure.  [See this post from the author of Electrum.](  You said it yourself - Electrum generates a "random collection of 12 words" that should have 128 bits of password entropy.  Almost any passphrase you think of will be much less random by orders of magnitude.  Your own passphrase could have only 28 bits of entropy, for example, which can be brute forced in a matter of days.

That is the whole purpose of a BIP0038 "two factor" wallet card.  If you distrust bit-card.de, then don't get their standard wallet card, get their BIP0038 card.

A few days ago, I bought 2 BTC on Coinbase.  After the 4 day wait, the balance in my account updated to show that I had 2 BTC, and a new address appeared (13nJZ9...) in my wallet that had a balance of 2 BTC.
A few days later, I log in again, and the address balance is now zero, even though the account balance still shows 2 BTC.  Is this normal?  Is the new address just a normal part of the funds transfer process?  I see a little over 2 BTC was transfered to a new address according to Blockchain, but I keep following the transactions on Blockchain, and all the addresses I see have final balances of 0 BTC.  Meanwhile, there are no addresses shown in Coinbase that have a balance of 2 BTC.
How do I find the address on Coinbase that has my 2 BTC?  And what's with all of those addresses on Blockchain that receives funds and then are emptied within 24 hours?  Maybe I'm just not familiar enough with how Coinbase manages transactions.  I have many other addresses that have received microtransactions that still show up in the list of addresses with the correct balances.

Summary: an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement is raising money for a new prepaid card to fight "inequities in the present financial services system". What are they promising?
* a "cashless option"
*  for people who want to stay outside of the traditional banking system (except the card is still issued through a bank)
* low cost for the cardholder ($250/year in fees on average)
* operations to be funded by transaction fees charged to merchants (yet those who will be most burdened are the "99%" small business - especially high volume/low profit margin businesses)
* "low fees" (withdrawing cash = $1.95/transaction, loading cash = $3.74 - $4.95/transaction, writing a check = $2)
* transparency (too early to tell)
Comparing with bitcoin's vision and claims:
* cashless (no paper notes)
* a distributed currency independent of any central authority (still true)
* low cost (virtually zero for most users)
* operations (confirmation of transactions) funded by the protocol and sender transaction fees (currently 0.0001 - 0.0005 BTC)
* low fees for exchanges (typically 1%)
* transparency (protocol is open-source)
How do they expect to succeed when their product isn't even aligned with their mission?  Occupy Wall Street is all about anti-corporate greed and freeing ourselves from the tyranny of financial institutions, yet the card is still issued by a bank, Visa still gets a cut of all transactions, and the card holds the people who use prepaid cards hostage with exorbitant fees.
It's obvious to those of us who use Bitcoin that in its current state, it is already successful as a cashless, transparent currency that is low cost and independent of the traditional banking system.  I feel that all the money they are raising could be better used towards expanding merchant adoption of Bitcoin, since it is already a 90% solution that has years of maturity over their proposed product.
Also, obligatory "Occupy Wall Street is still alive?!?"

1. **some people** think it's the next big thing, because the way Bitcoin works is a bit of a technological marvel, and it's a technological advance or a 21st century way of transacting currency.  There's no guarantee that Bitcoin will be successful, and nobody is under the illusion that Bitcoin is safe from lobbying.
1. The point is to take the control of money away from banks and government.  One of its *benefits* happens to be that it is particularly well suited for international transactions.  Have you ever tried to convert currency before?  Good luck trying to avoid a 3% - 5% fee.  In small to moderate transactions, Bitcoin transfers can be virtually free.
1. You might want to looking into Khan Academy's video series on Bitcoin to understand why this is believed to be fundamentally infeasible.  The blockchain is the global Bitcoin ledger, and to give yourself money, you'd have to generate a new blockchain and re-create the proof-of-work for each block that says that you really own those coins.  To do that, you would currently need 1.8 petahash/s (1,800,000,000,000,000 H/s) of processing power at a minimum to counterfeit such a transaction.  No one entity has that processing power available.
1. Again, recommend learning the fundamentals of Bitcoin on Khan Academy.  In summary, it is hard-coded in the algorithm.  Raising the cap would require the software developers of the Bitcoin algorithm to roll out revisions to the code, and for the majority of people who run Bitcoin software to accept and adopt the new version.  It is hard to imagine this happening, one of the obvious reasons being the dilution of the value of Bitcoin.
1. You need to be more specific with your concern, other than the vague possibility of something catastrophic that could happen just because computers are involved in the storage of Bitcoins.  Guess what - the majority of the world's wealth is stored on computers as well.  All of the world's banks and investment institutions have their ledgers stored on computer systems across the world.  If an asteroid the size of Texas hits the Earth, no traditional banking records would survive either.  If a gigantic enough coronal mass ejection event occurred, massive electrical surges caused by the geomagnetic storm would fry anything with electronics/connected to the power grid on the side of the earth facing the sun.  The beauty of it is that the blockchain would survive and Bitcoin would continue operating on millions of machines on the other side of the world.  No different than major banks that keep electronic backups of their ledgers and transactions all across the world.

There are a few comments about the ratio of male-to-female bitcoin users, but don't forget about men buying things for their women (whether because they want to, or they've been asked to).  My girlfriend uses bitcoin, but just as importantly, I would be willing to buy things for her as well : )

If in a liquid market it was widely believed that 1 BTC was worth $1000 USD, then people would buy up BTC until the price hits $1000 within minutes; it wouldn't take until December to hit that target price.  In other words, if there is any agreement about what BTC "should" be worth, it would already be trading at that price.
What BTC has been doing these past few days reflects changing sentiment and uncertainty in the market.  Nobody can say for sure what BTC will be worth in December.

Not true, actually.  You can pay a one-time fee and Coinkite will provide you with the private key.  In doing so, however, they won't guarantee any support if any errant transactions happen with your coins.

Seconded on issue   Both when I choose "Scan" or "Send" and select the QR icon to scan from QR, the scanner comes up, scans the QR, then goes back to the "Send" page without populating the address.

Law.  Civil law.
Analogy: "If the arch-bishop sexually abuses young boys, it must be legal and legitimate. Correct?"  No, because canonical and civil law says it is wrong, regardless of the authority's actions.
