use multisig and the business owner will have to sign it in order for the client to receive his bits. this way you can make sure the client get the bitcoin and don't abuse the system.

Good luck $2 @_date: 2014-09-16 01:37:06
They said no to ApplePay, so probably they're working already to get it done.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:07:35
Yeah sure, same shit happened with eBay is you remember. I remember first time when they agreed with bitcoin on eBay.co.uk 
Maybe there is same pattern with China, they did the test with Baidu, and now they are preparing something big, like Bitcoin + Alipay = love
Anyway Alibaba prepares something big, but I'm not sure if it's willing to include bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:02:38
You got me wrong. I have 3 bitcoin addresses attached to my wallet, first is associated with my home address, second with the work one and the last one with my parrents place. 
Depending what address I will use to pay, I want the shop to automatically get the shipping details associated, for me not to lose time with form filling.
I know that I can write my shipping details directly into blockchain, but this way everybody will be able to read them.
If someone is interested in developing this system, I'm ready to come with the financial support for it.

I was expecting you to say this. Anyway if they have an agreement with WebMoney more than sure someday they will reconsider bitcoin.

I don't think, at this point, that someone will be able to stop the whales. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:09:31
I can't see any good reasons for them not to move forward with bitcoin.

Or a good way to market my bottled water business when people who know about Bitcoin will start hunting those caps.
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:06:42
I can always place just a redeemable code inside the cap, but this won't be fun anymore.

Is there a link between Qualcomm, 21 and [OneWeb](
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:54:05
If they did this, then PayPal prepare to integrate bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:41:34
I would rather use them to reward my customers, even if I give them 10k bits, it will be enough to motivate customers to buy at least once from me just because they get bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:29:55
Well, at this time is not possible as we don't have enough people to pay using bitcoin. IMO people just don't want to spend their fiat for bitcoin, they will always think that price is too big and it's to late for bitcoin, but I'm sure that they will be more than happy to work for bitcoin. You want adoption find a solution for people to earn bitcoin.
