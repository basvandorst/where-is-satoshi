maybe this video from James D'Angelo which was posted recently: 
[Bitcoin 101 - A Million Killer Apps - Bitcoin's Big Bang of Disruption - Part 1 of 2](
after viewing this one i ended up watching every video on his channel.

read my edit 2 where i talk about using an IPN gateway to watch the votes come in in real time and you can track in a simple db table which address has voted already.  also this can discourage cheating since you will be able to see when a second vote is attempted.
and yes making an abstain address would be an option if some voter wanted to indicate they choose not to vote.

if it's a yes/no vote then send a unique 'vote yes' address and a unique 'vote no' address to each eligible voter. have a script create those addresses via blockchain.info payment api and have it forward all the yes payments/votes to one address and all the nos to another.
to vote a user sends a minimal payment to either their yes or no address. at the end of voting time you count how many ~~payments each address has received~~ of the addresses you sent to the voters received one or more payments. after the election you can publish the 2 addresses and the results can be independently verified on the blockchain.
if there are more than 2 choices to vote for then send each user a unique address for each of the choices.
ps: i have already written the code to do most of this stuff from previous projects so pm me if you need any help.
edit: if you initially only count payments to the destination addresses then people could double vote.
edit 2: i wrote this reply quickly so it's just a general concept, and i left out the best part: when you create each voter's yes and no address you can set it up to not just forward the payment, but you can also have it send an instant payment notification via the api and have it connect to a simple gateway you run that tallies the votes in real time and keeps track of who has already voted.

this. my site got dropped with no warning. after 3 years of running ads and the same type of content.
only got a vague 'does not meet our standards' message. after that happened it's impossible to contact anyone or get any info. the worst part was 3 weeks later they sent me a check for the previous month but stopped payment so it bounced and i got to pay that fee too.
tl;dr; fuck everything google.

when you die, if you were good and followed the rules, you get all your lost private keys back when you enter heaven.
but if you killed anybody or masturbated you lose them. too bad for /s
