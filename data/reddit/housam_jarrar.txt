It sets up a regulated exchange that would only allow trading in physical BTC(not futures).It makes the idea of an ETF almost redundant since institutional clients of NYSE will have access to the cryoto market directly.Such an exchange can remove allot of BTC from the market allowing demand to outstrip supply(prices going up).It would also allow people holding crypto to use BAKKT as a payment channel(a semi lightning network) for actual goods.which is why microsoft and Starbucks are also involved.It fulfills the prupose of crypto with the backing of one of the biggest regulated exchanges in the world.doesnt get any more bullish than that.

It depends on the company.if you hold your BTC on coinbase then you are good since they are insured against hacks.with that being said,if you do not have the private keys you dont really own the coins.food for thought.
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:28:27
Have you not heard of BAKKT which is launching in less than 60 days!.Your opinion of the price is obviously biased since your self interest of not owning any is driving your opinion into wishful thinking rather than anything else.I used to be the same way,but crypto rarely gives people what they wish for.Its better to have a little skin in the game in case you are wrong than to think you know what an appropriate price is!but thats just my opinion

Wouldnt call it analysis.Just a statement of fact.
@_date: 2018-09-01 05:20:43
To a certain extent.It is undeniable that BTC's massive interest last november and december were due to the price action which garnered much media attention and not the other way around.case in point is the current low volatility in the markets and how google trends are trending. especially when you couple that with the amazing news we have been getting as of late(BAKKT,NASDAQ....etc).For retail investors all that matters is price action and news pertaining to it specifically (usually last one in and first one out).At least thats my impression.
@_date: 2018-09-26 06:46:16
Exactly...body candles were 6900 at the february low.6400 in april and 5750 in june.only an idiot with no TA experience would call that a straight line and therefore a descending triangle(bearish).In reality,it is a descending wedge(bullish).

@_date: 2018-09-23 06:00:28
Amen....the billions upon billions of dollars being invested in the infastructure right now can only mean one thing.People and corporations with deep puckets are going to ensure BTC's success.BTC has certainly had its moments of potential failures,but if the exchange that once handled 80% of BTC's volume collapsed and BTC still survived and flourished.Then its failure is anything but ensured.HODL and dream the big dream.The window for retail investors managing to own at least 1 BTC is closing fast.Forget the nay sayers.There is a reason why wealth is always concentrated.Because people are too consumed with "why" rather than "why not".But I digress.

@_date: 2018-09-30 18:43:45
I think you are not understanding my point.If BTC is deflationary which it is then there is no reason why its value cannot go up in value indefinitly.It is not wether 1 BTC equals 2 sheep.If you knew that 1 BTC will be worth 3 sheep next year would you buy that sheep today or wait.When enough people follow that logic then the loop will reinforce itself causing your 1 BTC equaling 2 sheep to shoot up to 4 sheep.This is exactly what happened during the great depression and collapsed the world economies.How will BTC be any different when you take into account that current fiat currencies were backed by gold back then?

We have much bigger players in this market than we did in 2013.retail investor sentiment might have been important back then ,but now that sentiment is the fuel that allows bigger players to extort what they can from weak hands on the downside and greedy shorts on the upside.thats why HODL is far better than trading.
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:25:34

Those who cannot follow logic cannot be conquered by it.I am refering to your argument that has anything but an argument.you may disagree with people who believe that BTC will make them wealthy but they at least attempt to give their reasons.using vulgarities to make a point is the argument of the inept.but I digress
@_date: 2018-08-03 07:29:53
Amusing read.an interesting combination of accurate information followed by wrong conclusions.Too many to go point by point but ill try,
1.Google trends is a lagging indicator.Just like buying when everybody is talking about BTC(high trend) is the worse thing you can do(FOMO).bottoming interest is actually a bullish not bearish thing!.
2.volume is low when the market is correcting is an indication of a lack of conviction with the move(bullish).the fact we had the highest volume back in december and january is an indication that upward movement is where the market tendency is(bullish).
The writer might be right with his call,but it will be for reasons other than the ones he stated here.but  I dogress.
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:24:49
Makes sense...if people were expecting BTC to break the descending wedge formation and not retest then they are not aware of how resistence vs. Support works!
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:23:33
They almost never do.buying at lower prices leads to a sort of greed similar to FOMO where people desire lower and lower prices which makes most if not all of them miss the very thing they are looking for.finding tops is as silly as trying to find bottoms.By the time they realize this they will most likely buy at higher prices than they sold.Markets rarely reward people who think they can predict it.especially a market as volatile as this one.
@_date: 2018-08-31 02:53:07
In canada...unless there is enough renewable energy to overtake BTC mining electricity needs then this one example is irrelevant.I'm sure its even cheaper to mine BTC in venezuela.Doesnt mean it sets the standard for what should be the cost world wide.Lower electricity prices are only an indication of week demand.if more and more mining farms open in such areas then prices will explode(supply and demand).

Unless you hold the BTC for 1 year or longer , it makes no difference.it will be taxed as regular income.goodluck
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:32:39
I have my reservationa about this prospect.The biggest challenge is the fact that BTC is deflationary.which means its value goes up over time due to its limited supply and increasing demand.If a bank decides to issue a mortgage in BTC then only a fool will agree to it since the value of BTC will be far higher by the time the 30 years are done that the borrower will never be able to fully pay the loan back.An example would be buying a 200k home now for roughly 35 BTC.If BTC were to ever hit 1 million then that loan will be closer to 35 million $.unless fiat is completely eliminated and BTC is extremely stable,such prospects are anything but possible.

You make some valid points,but I have to add that markets,especially efficient markets have to have a mechanism by which to weed out not only bad projects,but also weed out week and inexperienced traders/investors.The fact of the matter is,this market is being easily mamipulated exactly because of a lack of liquidity which would be solved by institutional investors getting more and more involved.Wether we like it or not,it is not debatable that these investors and their financial institutions are and will be the gatekeepers for wider adoption and utility.Just because we wish something is a certain way does not make it so.
In a perfect world,your points would be well worth the consideration,but in this world it just symbolizes an aspiration rather than a reality.But this is just my own personal take.I could be wrong.

Not sure what my comment had to do with CNBC,With that being said you need to understand what causes such events in the first place.Big money in the market need to be completely complacent in order for the trigger to release sheer panic.How do i know that is not the case?because the VIX is already spiking.what that means is people are already starting to hedge their positions with derivatives.A crash is still possible,but it gets less and less likely as people and institutions hedge their exposure more and more.
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:25:14
Cimpletely agree with your well thought out argument.The only thing I would add to it is what andreas antonopolis mentioned in one of his speeches.Which is that people in the west already have easy access to far more convernient payment methods to make something like BTC sound practical,however,people in developing countries who deal with currencies that are all but worthless will be compelled to adopt BTC to protect their wealth and livelihood.

From the wallets and their sizes.I would speculate owning one full BTC would get you there.less than a million wallets out of a total of 25 million wallets carry such a balance.That would actually put you in the top 5% of wallets so maybe 0.25BTC would get the 20%.Highly speculative though!

This is just my opinion but I think you are correct in your assertion Lightning is a payment channel and would not have any effect on people buying  and selling BTC but rather help facilitate BTC transactions for already owned BTC(Me vs. Starbucks for instance).Segwit is the main facilitator ,however,it took BTC 10 years to get to where it is right now and it is safe to assume it will still take a few years to optimize second layer solutions to accomodate robust scalability.I am in it for the long haul so I  am more enclined to be realistic and optimistic rather than worry about the small stuff.Rome wasnt built in a day.

Wouldnt go that far.BTC has had these limitations since its inception.If this didnt prevent these bubbles from occuring in the past what makes you think it will in the future?I am actually leaning towards a theory that these limitations are the reason for these outsized returns.These bottle necks cause availability issues preventing proper supply which leads to parabolic price swings.but I digress.

Not sure MSFT gave BTC and only BTC a stamp of approval.As to BTC from a functionality standpoint,it not only has issues with scaling,it is also a POW ,which makes it impractical for anything other than financial transactions and/or a store of value.The crypto space is evolving way beyond that and while your assertion is correct that most of it is still unproven.Dismissing them out of hand in my opinion is foolish.Take IOTA and their tangle for example.free micro transactions and unlimited scaling ,coupled with some powerful partnerships including VW and even the UN.How can BTC compete with that!!.
Bottom line for me is this .BTC was unproven until it was and so will mamy other coins.Thats why it is prudent to hold BTC as well as well researched projects that have the potential to go far beyond BTC's capabilities.

I do have to say that reading bearish news or opinions lately has given me hope thst those who think the market is going down or those who sold hoping to buy back in cheaper have already done so.It will be amusing to watch the current bears become the next FOMO crowd.Its all the same dumb money.

The only flaw in your logic is an assumption that the entire globe only requires one good option per niche to be successful.DASH is a good privacy coin,but so is Monero.I do not think crypto is at a stage where only one good option is required.The same applies to non crypto related market.Payment processors for instance like visa ,mastercard,AMEX,Discover...etc all co-exist.Not a zero sum game.But I do agree that BTC will always be king.I very much doubt ETH or any other coin for that matter will be able to overtake it..even in the long run

Bought between march and may!That means this so-called whale is currently in the red.Makes absolutelyy no sense why he would want to trigger a selloff and lose even more value for his remaining BTC.Unless he is mentally deranged,he is probably looking to buy some ALTS.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:42:54
True..but if this whale bought OTC.why would he now want to sell on an exchange when he is clearly in the red.makes no sense!
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:50:58
I agree with your sentiment.in 2014 the marketcap peaked at 15 Billion and reached a low of 4 Billion which is  27% of the ATH.we are currently at 230 Billion from an 850 Billion which is also 27% of the ATH.comparing a market where BTC was 90% of the total to todays market is ludicrous.

As someone who has used Tether myself,a record of Tether issuance is irrelevant for the purpose of substantiating a link.Tether is issued when demand is high for tether which causes tether price to go above the 1$ price it is set at.This researcher completely ignores this fact and the fact that people buy tethers using real $.Therefore ,the extraordinary claim that tether was being used to pump BTC price depends on him proving that tether issuer is directly buying BTC's using tether created out of thin air.I do agree that tether's lack of transparency is alarming,but to go to the length of making a manipulation claim,you need more concrete evidence.If he truly had evidence,CFTC would have at the very least announced an open criminal investigation.which they have not.

No assumption.Its a fact.Slow transaction speed making it impractical for mass transactions as it grows.looking at how much electricity its consuming with only 20-30 million users/speculators.Centralized mining pools creating a point of weakness.Centralized ownership(look at the havoc created by a single entity mt.gox).While BTC has a platform nothing of note is being built upon it,unlike ETH ,NEO...etc.
I hate saying bad things about BTC,especially since 25% of my portfolio is in it,But my purpose as a well informed investor is to know the strengths and weaknesses of the coins I owm.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:22:58
Assuming your correct.not sure I see the correlation between them buying low and their call for people to keep the drop in perspective.if anything,they should be listened to if they bought low since they probably heard all the garbage we currently hear about BTC going down the tubes!
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:57:28
Makes sense.excluding the lost forever BTC's of 20-30% of the circulating supply which leaves us with 13-14 million BTC's currently.which means that only 13 million individuals could ever own 1 BTC.Not including the whales who own a few thousand and you can see why BTC can easily reach the 100k level.Just HODL and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-06-30 09:44:25
Depends on what you bought?if you go to the website of each of the projects you bought they would have list of recommended wallets.you also need to figure out what kind of wallet you want(hot wallet,paper wallet,cold storage wallet)?.you should have researched this before buying but its never too late.

What you say does not match with what is actually happening in the market.First mover's advantage does not mean that an inferior technology will surpass better tech simply because it was there first!Myspace had the first movers advantage before facebook!The tech needs to stay ahead of the game in order to survive.As a matter of fact,if you look at any technological advancement or new techbology as of late(search engines,virus protections,online shopping...etc).The first almost never becomes the dominant.Gooogle beat netscape and alta vista and even MSFT.DSL and cable beat AOL online and dial up...etc.Store of value is the only hope BTC has and I believe it is achievable.
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:41:05
Worthless speculation.someone who own almost 100k worth of BTC is not stupid enough to dump the price of his own stack by selling on exchanges.probably wants to buy some ALT coins or something!but I digress

An equally good point.One can only hope that those in charge would be proactive in monitoring irregularities.However,I do think the CFTC was quick on this particular one since they did issue a 
subpoena last december to tether.We havent heard much after that ,which tells me there might be nothing there.I emphasize the word might since no one trully knows.Our best hope right now is for other more reputable stable coins like DAI and others can take over and leave tether in the dustpin of controversy.

They are required by law to report your buys and sells.I started with coinbase in 2017 but i didnt sell anything in that year therefore i had nothing to report,however,when you sell any crypto for fiat then that generates a profit or a loss that has to be reported to the IRS .They are not required to track your crypto beyond the exchange.Only your transactions on it.

The 17 days is how long it takes for the transaction to settle.Verifying funds availability and transfer takes time in the traditional financial market.unfortunately there is no way around this ,especially for fiat gateway exchanges.Once the 17 days are up you are free to do as you wish with your coins.

I certainly expect that number in the not so distant future.remember this,the market almost always does what so few expect.the loud voices that said BTC to 3k back in april and last month were so far proven wrong.As long as people remain in disbelief over such an estimate,I think we do have a shot at it.

What you explain is the very definition of inflation(hesitation to hold due to expected value drop).BTC is actually deflationary by nature so I would say what you are proposing is quite dangerious because it will work until it abruptly doesnt!which will cost you allot more in the long run than the small reward you might get now.

I had the same outlook you did,until I came across a video that explained the dynamic value of fiat currencies.It is true that inflation will be a huge problem in the coming years and even decades,but the fact still remains that fiat currencies only derive their value from market perceptions and wether we like it or not,the US dollar is in far better shape than the euro zone and even china.Such discreoancies has always played into the hand of the US dollar.If you think about it.The 2008 crises was a US one that spread like wildfire  in the world economy and yet people flocked to the dollar for save haven.Dollars might be in a really bad spot but other currencies are far worse shape.unlessvI see an economic calamity that does not make people want to own dollars,only then will I believe its way pastvits bedtime.Notcto sayvI dont believe in the superiority of BTC in the long run,but don't discount the US dollar just yet.

Good point.I guess if your an investor then you would look at it differently(not necessarily wrong,but different).Looking at such technology with an eye to the future makes more sense to me than the here and now.BTC does not derive its value from use cases alone.A store of value and protection from inflationary fiat currency is also a benefit of owning BTC.

A distinction without a difference.In a country like china where the government has complete control over the money supply (capitol controls).The government can and will be effective in stopping people within china from being able to convert their currency into crypto or any other fiat currency for that matter.which is pretty evident from the dramatic drop in china's share of the crypto market.Once these restriction exhibit a clear negative correlation with china's technological advancements,will they be in a position of having to choose the lesser of 2 evils.
