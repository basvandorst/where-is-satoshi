To less , too late ... Until all of this settles down across all exchanges, people are buying very low from weak hands. Absence of a common marketing strategy makes this type of bs announcement from MtGox likely to happen again.

Niko, I am far from being patient enough to explain these banksters that bitcoin is good. They are so deep into the banking and common financial system that they cannot understand and make sense out of it. Gave up. I tell them to read about it on the internet, or go see Bitcoin Embassy people in Montreal. And if they understand why I keep my bitcoins, come back and we can then do business together.

. MHO, 
* Price drop happenned for the last month due to China uncertainty. 
* This uncertainty is now mostly gone or weak hands got rid of their BTCs already. 
* China Holders are still in the game and are waiting to buy more after April 15.

In order to face competition a la Apple Pay, ease of payment for the consumer is the missing link. Consumer must ba able to pay for a coffee as easily as any NFC card (mastercard) today, on top of lower fee for the merchant which in turn must encourage usage of any BitcoinNFC method as opposed to ApplePay, MastercardNFC etc. Getting on board Amazon and Alibaba (and else) would also boost dramatically the cryptomarket visibility.

I will never have to switch to Android because ... I am with Android since Day -1. Not because it is the best mobile OS, but because it is until now the most flexible, customizable and (almost) completely free of corporate control.
What's coming ( best scenario ever for Bitcoin - not necessarily in chronological order) :
- Apple bans Bitcoin transaction apps (check)
- Apple deploys its own transaction system (&gt; beginning of the end )
- Merchants see this as ' yet another fee on top of existings ' 
- Apple makes more deals with banksters to try reducing credit cards and transaction fees (too late)
- Google adheres to bitcoin
- Paypal adheres to bitcoin
- Amazon adheres to bitcoin
- Merchants adopt more and more Bitcoins and paypal ...
- Samsung, Lenovo and LG enters into the bitcoin fun game
- Bitcoin hits 5000$ value 
- Windows gets ( late again) into the bitcoin fun game
- Apple kills its own transaction system

I second this. I follow bitcoins since 3 years and based on China boom and dump activities of the last 6 months, it looks like Chinese weak hands are out of the way. Therefore, there is less and less people selling now that PBOC are not scaring people anymore (or at least, they may try but impacts are much less than 3 months ago). Western and occident (BTCers, Wall Street, etc) are watching on the tip of their seat right now, waiting for the right moment to buy.

Do not go to this website or give your login details on any website other than the official Cryptsy website. There were two avenues of the Phishing attempt. One was via SMS, using our provider Twilio and gained entry into our logs and sending ability via a weak password on that account. The passwords on this account have been secured. The other avenue was via email using the same mailing service we use (Mailgun), but was not sent using our account. It is uncertain where the email list for this Phishing attempt was attained from, as we do not show any unauthorized access to our Mailgun account nor our internal systems. We are still investigating this matter. If you were a victim of this phishing, you should log into your account at Cryptsy immediately and do the following: 1. Change your password and enable 2fa if you don’t already have it enabled. 2. Check your pending withdrawals, we currently have withdrawals disabled so if you see one that shouldn’t be there you can request to have it cancelled. Regarding other issues that have been apparent at Cryptsy for the last couple months, I will be making another post to explain what has been happening in the next couple days. BigVern UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE EXTENT OF THE PHISHING ATTEMPT, ALL WITHDRAWALS WILL BE CANCELLED AND ARE PAUSED

What makes Bitcoin so existing is how predictions can be a total shot in the dark, as opposed to any other market controlled behind the curtains by banksters. Which is actually , still, a good thing for the humanity.

Paper wallet is good only for hodling large amount. Assuming that precaution at creation was done. Just ensure keeping a photocopy in a second different secure place.

@_date: 2019-02-26 16:23:41
Agree with the slow, gradual upward trends, but it is already started. There is too many "good things" in the cryptosphere, compared to early 2015, where post MtGox "dark" mindset was still solid. Now, we do not have this type of atmosphere. To me , November slump is a "man-maid" , intentional accident caused by the Bcash team. For these reasons, i see the 5000-5500 in the radar, by sept -nov 2019. My 5 satoshis.

@_date: 2019-02-06 23:29:29
Agree ... And it could sit in the 3200 4000 range for this period.

@_date: 2018-11-16 14:17:29
Not meaningless at all. Meaningful by knowing the context and history of Bitcoin. The last graph shows that adoption is there and sustained. Most of the spikes you refer to are due to poor exchanges security , very frequent between 2013 and 2016, media hype against cryptos (refer to bitcoin obituary) and FUD related, which was frequent until Nov 2017.

Agree. Just sit and ride the wave.Only Hodlers know this feeling. Most of new bitcoin adopters do not know about pre-bullrun smelt. No need to look at their r/bitcoin subscription date. Most of Fiat traders who have joined lately keep trying to influence new comers by using their stock trading skills and experience, which is good in a way but many time do not reflect the reality of a new , geo-borderless asset like cryptos.

Adoption of cryptos is not the point here. It is much more than money. It is to denounce banks cartel and control over governance of the country. Crypto is one of many ways to remove a little bit of money control of their hands bit by bit. This is what Yellow Jackets need to understand about how cryptos can help a bit in this movment in over-taxation of the France gov. My 2 satoshis.

The way America makes money is mainly by using current banking and finance systems rules.

All analysis that I read here and there are often pushing bitcoin down below 3000$. These are coming mainly from the Wall street and fiat trading world.
