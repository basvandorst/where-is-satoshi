This isn't complicated. I view all evidence in the same light except evidence derived from corrupt agents. There is a wealth of evidence against Ulbricht but the murder's specifically he was never tried for and the evidence with respect to those comes from a questionable source. I have no view (nor any real interest) on the guilt or innocence of the agents except to the extent that until they are exonerated and since they have been removed from their posts it destroys their credibility in terms of what they offer to the Ulbricht case.

Im not a fan of him at all. You are to be frank a moron. Im talking about specific evidence of a crime for which he was not tried. If serious allegations against the source of the evidence in question is irrelevant to you then you are painfully stupid.

Why does this matter? Is there a bitcoin to wire service I don't know about? Much of the foolish overconfident stuff DPR did was out of too much faith in the anonymity of TOR and bitcoin. If he was laundering 80k into cash you'd think he'd use it to live a slightly better than student lifestyle and it would create a huge tax mess for him. Thinking you can just make a wire transfer that way with no explanation is far more idiotic than keeping a journal on an encrypted drive. 
Whatever opinion you have of Ulbricht and it changes my opinion of him a ton if he attempted murders I think its fair to ignore evidence that A) came from a potentially corrupt source b) was never presented in court.
I know not all murders were mentioned in his trial but some were. They must have had evidence not from a corrupt source.

I'm surprised about the amount of financial ignorance around here. Stocks are a very good long term investment. Cash isn't. If you don't know why then I don't know what brought you here in the first place. I provided a link to Warren Buffett explaining why stocks are safer than cash in the long run. Beyond that I'm basically through with this argument. 
Paying off a mortgage at a low interest rate as you'd have today is much worse than buying stocks. Why? Because if you're mortgage is 6% and inflation is 3% your real rate of return is only 3% on paying off the mortgage. You'll get better than that in the stock market.

In criminal cases, the so-called “mercy rule” permits a criminal defendant to introduce evidence of pertinent character traits of the defendant and the victim. But that is because the accused, whose liberty is at stake, may need “a counterweight against the strong investigative and prosecutorial resources of the government.” C. Mueller &amp; L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence: Practice Under the Rules, pp. 264–5 (2d ed. 1999). See also Richard Uviller, Evidence of Character to Prove Conduct: Illusion, Illogic, and Injustice in the Courtroom, 130 U.Pa.L.Rev. 845, 855 (1982) (the rule prohibiting circumstantial use of character evidence “was relaxed to allow the criminal defendant with so much at stake and so little available in the way of conventional proof to have special dispensation to tell the factfinder just what sort of person he really is”). Those concerns do not apply to parties in civil cases.

I'm not an expert either but I disagree with this. A defendant is generally permitted to introduce character evidence in his defense very liberally because of the constitution.  See United States v. Dimberio, FRE 404 or Google it.

So its a nascent technology that a government can cripple if it for some reason suddently devoted millions to the task. Im not sure thats a flaw with bitcoin unless we expect total invincibility to unexpected attacks with unclear motives. Besides a government who would spend millions to do this? A bank? At this point it makes more sense to ignore bitcoin.

The fact that its volatile is not unique to Ukraine and is obvious but he prefaced the comment as if it had something to do with Ukraine. He did this because he dislikes bitcoin and regular posts on the troll subreddit.
If he had some personal stories such as "in December of 2013 many of my friends in Ukraine saw an experimental currency that had gone through booms and busts spiking and said 'that looks like a stable store of wealth' bought and lost money" then that would provide value. But he didnt do that.
If Ukraine had convenient access to the US stock market it wouldnt make sense to reference the 1999 bubble as if it were the only time people bought and if someone posted that in r investing you might ask why they are there at all and thats what I asked him.

People always say that about everything but its counterfactual so how do we know? Some things like calculus or natural selection we know that it was pretty close. Some things like relativity people claim it would have been 20 years before we discovered that without Einstein.

My question was why are you here? Why waste time trolling if you have bigger problems? If you dont think bitcoin can help then theres no reason to be here at all. Yes your example is misleading. The situation in Ukraine was not isolated to December 2013. Its a developing and ongoing problem so yes its contrived and misleading and would by your own admission be a coincidence at best and as illogical a basis for further decisions as my december 2012 to october 2013 example. Sorry to hear what youre going through, I just dont see trolling as a positive step forward. Were you educated in the west? Your english is good.
@_date: 2015-09-29 19:18:31
Whether pro bitcoin or anti bitcoin it does not provide value to pick a time frame that fits the point youre trying to make then go on to discuss why that proves your point. If he picked a time where it went from pennies to $100 that would also not provide value and the reason is because its a global price and doesnt tell us anything specific to Ukraine that we dont already know.
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:51:22

Again if he gave some valid argument why bitcoin wont work in Ukraine, for example because of cultural issues, thats interesting. His argument essentially is Bitcoin wont work anywhere because its not at its all time high. Im not opposed to any argument and im not in charge here. I just find it curious that people hang around here if they dont see any benefit to bitcoin. Bitcoin is more available in his country thats all the headline was, if hes against that whys he here? That was my question. Do you understand? 
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:44:19
Sure there's a lot of hyperbole because people are enthusiastic about it. If you aren't then why are you here? I.e. why would you make misleading statements the other way. For example you keep coming back to this example of buying in December 2013 and apparently then and then only. If someone in Ukraine was buying for saving hopefully they're buying over time. Either way its a silly contrived example. It would be like me saying Ukraine will benefit because look what happened between December 2012 and November 2013. Is that a valid argument on my part? One of the things people are excited about with respect to Bitcoin is that it can act as a digital gold with some extra properties that make it even more powerful. Gold also goes down sometimes:
But I think gold would still be a smart place to place your savings as compared to a poorly managed currency. I guess my point is if you can't see a benefit at all at any point for one of Bitcoin's main use cases, in a place where its supposed to be used, yet you post here, then I find that odd. You also say that nobody has any savings what so ever with which to speculate which is probably also hyperbole. So you've gone the other way with the exaggeration. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:28:51
You're looking for a string citation or something? That's been my observation. A strong theme with them is strongly anti-liberty ideology or among the less informed strongly confused and think its a ponzi scheme. Those are the themes you see in and when the vocal people post here. 
The extent to which its swarming is debatable but over the last year its gotten to be every single thread there will be at least a few people trying to nitpick and attack and mock. I wouldn't say that theres an overwhelming amount of criticism, but the criticism you do see is not constructive but more trollish. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 11:41:36
My point wasnt that youre not from Ukraine. My point was youre opposed to Bitcoin and your post provided no value. People reflexively assume that it would because youre there but all you told us is when the price peaked.

I'm just referring to the more common usage not taking a position - of course some modern economists would use the old definition.
More to the point I think what Bitcoin will look like is it finding a strong use and going way up or going to 0. The fact that 4% "inflation" in the supply of bitcoin is misleading if we expect it to look like the dollar. I expect it to still behave like an option. Gold is a better store of value than the dollar and its also volatile and so are stocks. I'm not sure we can have something that is both stable and a good store of value and increases 4% a year like a bond. My intuition is that Bitcoin is going to behave like a growth stock for a long time with large up and downside potential.

Whats ironic is he seems to be on the extreme politically which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of his persona. He seems to be one of the most intelligent and grounded people in the community but he also seems like he might be an anarcho-capitalist - not that that's necessarily a contradiction but most anarcho capitalists seem much less skeptical about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:32:04
Youre way off. His whole argument is hypothetical. He isnt saying this is why they dont buy bitcoin hes saying why its a bad option for them in his opinion.
Do you honestly think its widely known? And in one of the few places in the world where they would have broken even in terms of their local currency they are uniquely sour on it? Give me a break. A man on the street hasnt heard of bitcoin and is stuck in the local currency and wouldnt care that in hindisght with maximally bad timing he could have been in the same situation hes in now by buying into an experimental currency.

Criticism is fine. If you're the kind of person who calls libertarians nutso you're a jerk who is here to troll and as far as I'm concerned you're not "helping bitcoin succeed" just because your negative. I'm partial to libertarian politics but I do think Marc Andreesen is right that libertarians might turn on bitcoin because it is really extremely trackable and not private. That said, if hating libertarians makes you hate bitcoin and brings you here to troll you probably aren't providing constructive criticism. To some it represents the embodiment of libertarian ideals pushed out into the real world and they can't stand it, I guess.

How could this possibly be the biggest news in bitcoin right now? 
@_date: 2015-09-30 03:06:11
I was referring to this:
"bitcoin is a terrible alternative to the dollar for Ukrainians.
to show you what i mean
at the beginning of the ukrainian economic crisis in december 2013 it cost me 8 hrivnas to buy 1 dollar, now it costs 24. it's depreciated to a third of its value in the last year 18 months. in december 2013 it would have cost me $900 to buy 1 bitcoin, now it's $238. it's depreciated to a third of its value in the last year 18 months.
so, since the crisis started here in december 2013: if i had bought dollars/euros in november 2013 they would still be about the same value now. if i had held hrivnas they would have lost 2 thirds of their value if i had bought bitcoin they would have lost 2 thirds of their value (plus fees for converting)
that is the reality i live in, and also why ukrainians aren't buying bitcoins."
This quote references $900/bitcoin. Since this is a period of less than a month in Bitcoin's 6 year history. I think its misleading to focus only on this period as if that is the only time that anyone in Ukraine could buy bitcoin. 
Whether he has observed people buying them, I don't really care. As you can tell if you have any reading comprehension my focus was on asking why someone with no interest in bitcoin would be here and why he would respond to what he sees as "hyperbole" by picking a worst case scenario and using it as an example of what its like in Ukraine. My point was also, everybody knows the global price so its not an interesting observation as something Ukraine specific would be.

Bitcoin would need to grow substantially if it were to be used purely for black markets and I find it unlikely that governments will ban it.
The real risk? That you will sell your holdings based on what you read on the internet. Your no doubt vast holdings flooding the market based on some random comment on the internet could be a blow bitcoin just never recovers from.
Its hard to picture all governments taking the position that bitcoin was cute when ti was used for cryptolocker and silk road but now that its being used for things like Gemini its going to suddenly be outlawed. I also don't see bitcoin having a major impact on the dollar so why would they do this?

I really dont think its true that theyre supposed to be obscure. From the point of view of people in MLMs there is a huge incentive to make it seem like its growing and to tell everyone you can.

I meant the craigslist thing in the Jeremy rifkin zero marginal cost society sense.  It costs so little for craigslist to list an additional product and they charge so little that there is no adapting to it. I don't blame the industry for not adapting to this its a no win situation. 
I meant financial middle men. Like rather than person sending money to his bank which sends money to a grocers bank which sends money to a grocer who sends money to a farmer's bank and so on etc. If people could really be their own bank- if software someday made this safe- you'd cut out the financial middlemen. I'm not saying bitcoin would disrupt distributors or retailers.
Any individual bank with smart people and capital can adapt or even pivot but I expect bankruptcies and the industry to shrink. All they provide are information and trust. You're probably a bitcoin skeptic so I'd add that I'd think this even if bitcoin didn't exist for numerous other reasons.
edit: another example is the post office. Everyone blames them, and they are terrible at what they do, but the real reason they are in such dire straights is because email is both better and free and there is nothing they can do about that.

There is a difference between the U.S. dollar being mass counterfeited or hyperinflated and losing your wallet at the grocery store. This doesn't mean its not sad for someone to lose their wallet in the grocery store. But it makes a big difference in evaluating how safe it is to have your money in dollars. Dollars are safe because they only lose 3% of value a year and have been around a long time. Bitcoin is a new thing and thus risky, but not because someone lost their wallet. There's a major distinction and it has nothing to do with lack of sympathy.

I don't think its going to be just absorbed into the big banks and that they'll continue with business as usual while making early bitcoin adopters rich.

I see it potentially doing what craigslist did to the classified ad industry but to a lesser extent.

Well Facebook has been buying apps because there is already fragmentation. People don't mind switching apps. They want an app that does one thing really well. Look what Zuckerberg said when Facebook forced everyone to use the messanger app:
"Asking everyone in our community to install a new app is a big ask," Zuckerberg said. "I appreciate that that was work and required friction. We wanted to do this because we believe that this is a better experience. Messaging is becoming increasingly important. On mobile, each app can only focus on doing one thing well, we think."

The market is what you were referencing not moving with the announcement. If you're taking cues on whether this is big news based on the market looking ahead you have to stick with that logic. I don't have a strong opinion on this but I don't think your logic is very consistent. You can't expect the market to look ahead a few days, as you implicitly do, but not a few months. This is an expected event so the market shouldn't move, either way.

In a social network I'd be interested in MAU. With coinbase I'd be more interested in how many purchased bitcoin and how much.

If someone received $1 from a friend then logged on every month and looked at it I'd consider that person pretty irrelevant.

He seems to be saying that it objectively lowers costs but this only really matters to companies if a significant portion of the customer base uses it. In other words its valuable to attract 1% totally new customers or its valuable to save 2% on 10% of existing customers. Its not worth it to save 2% on 1% of existing users. Calling it speculative bullshit is pretty out of line and I don't even really see where you're coming from unless its just huge emotional bias against bitcoin.

You're arguing that the gold standard after working for thousands of years suddenly "failed." You need to understand that this is a mere opinion. Many things changed around the time of the great depression. The world was much  more interconnected for one. And this talk acknowledges that the world has been on a fiat standard in recent times. 
I think fiat has some advantages that make it better for some purposes than gold. I think where we'd disagree is I don't think the fact that it can be printed is one of those advantages. The Federal Reserve controls the supply of money just well enough that it works great for short term purposes but utterly fails for long term. You cannot, for example, save dollars for retirement. You are forced to buy equities.

You said that the early adopters would never sell. I was just pointing out that you are wrong. More people will buy or they won't hardly anyone has any so there's tons of room for potential demand. It depends if people find it useful or speculate on people finding it useful in the future. And a lot of coins mined now are expensive so obviously it will get more evenly distributed. Bitcoin is still in its early stages and nobody should have a ton of money relative to their net worth in it in my opinion.

In a ponzi scheme payments are actually made with new investors money and there are false promises including false stated returns in Madoff. What you're describing as a "transfer" is simply an asset appreciating allowing an individual to sell it for more fiat. This is no different than Google stock... Is this really lost on you?

Those overstock numbers are exactly what you would expect. A tiny portion of the population uses bitcoin. Do you have any evidence that overstock or the people here considered this bad news and down voted it because they were "depressed." The mozilla thing is more interesting. I think it goes to show you how misunderstood bitcoin is. I really wish mods would stick to the subject at hand and not derail the conversation with inaccurate info because this board is becoming unreadable. Everyone up voted your airing of the grievances but me so I guess you were wrong.

Time will tell whether your idiotic conspiracy theory is correct or not. If its true it wont go on for 20 years. 
There are other metrics you can look at. Do you think this lone guy with 10,000 btc is also faking local bitcoins volume. I conceded that your scenario is hypothetically possible and i havent made any decisions based on the transaction volume. To simply assume your conspiracy theory is correct based on the fact that its possible is where you are going wrong. You are talking about something that is possible but which seems very unlikely.

I don't think its a matter of doing it yourself. Its replacing services with software. Like the trezor and all the later generations perform the banking functions. Similar to how some knowledge profession functions are replaced by the internet today (like doctors for simple questions)

From what I understand companies like overstock both retain some bitcoin and use some of it to pay employees. I'm not sure whether this matters as from the standpoint of a consumer. If it's cheaper to pay with visa a consumer can pay with visa if bitcoin is cheaper than can pay with bitcoin. Most of the stuff you purchase at Walmart was made in China so ultimately your dollars will convert to RMB but does this matter as a consumer?
Bitcoin has properties in my opinion that will make it useful for several purposes. I won't get into this and you obviously don't agree and that's fine. We don't have to agree and you don't have to participate but calling it a ponzi is more than just a disagreement it's flat out incorrect. People who hold bitcoin are taking a large risk that things won't work out based on future demand but are neither victims nor participants in a scam. I don't advocate individuals to buy bitcoin because it's risky both in terms of value and security risk if someone is not tech savy. Gavin Andressen I believe also advises people not to buy at this stage. So this isn't a sales pitch I guess it's just... you're wrong and what are you doing here anyway?

Yet this has up votes? Why? because he preemptively whined? I'm down voting you not because it's "depressing" but because it's a trite, dumb comment. Yes the subreddit devoted to bitcoin probably has a pro bitcoin bias. You're not going to change that by coming in and whining and bitching about "everyone."  And there are more than enough people looking to jump all over any technicality like the Princeton mooc not offering course credit. This thread doesn't need to be about you or this subreddit generally. It has a topic. Please down vote this clown.

In the long run how could it be more than one hop?  For example if I buy a candy bar with a dollar tomorrow there is no way for me to control what that person does with it. He might by drugs. How can coinbase know that OP sent to his son and didn't sell to a stranger for cash at local bitcoin or anywhere else?

I guess neither of you are talking regulation so this is sort of a side comment. I attended a presentation by a lawyer who had studied the most recent draft of the bit license and he mentioned that there was a carve out for developers however developers of alt coins were covered by the bit license. I couldn't square those statements but I guess it means that in the future making doge coin in ny would not be legal. It seems to me the SEC and local laws already can deal with scams I think removing the developer exception from people developing alt coins is a mistake if that is what the bit license does.

There are so many layers of regulation in banks. They are extremely heavily regulated. There is a legal fiction that you are a creditor of your bank not a bailor. Given that would you deposit into a bank that was going to gamble with your money and keep the profits. Probably not but because of the FDIC nobody cares. It's one problem fixing another problem fixing another. You should be a bailor there should be no FDIC them there would be no need for glass stegall but each mistake needs to be papered over with another mistake which will have unintended consequences down the road.

Bitcoin has more value every day if more can be done with it and there is increased demand for it.  Maybe gold is a better comparison than a stock but either way there is no legitimate argument that it's a ponzi scheme. The history of it is transparent. It's an asset you can personally control as long as the protocol survives so you aren't relying on anyone's promise. Of course it's risky and the protocol could break and maybe the demand for it will evaporate. You can have that argument but calling it a ponzi is completely illegitimate.

This has been his consistent position. But what I do not understand is it seems like apples and oranges. Yes, taxation gives fiat value but that does not effect Bitcoin's value. Basically I agree the dollar will always be worth something because you can use it to pay taxes but it doesn't follow that Bitcoin does not also have value. Lots of things have value.

They serve a purpose. Think about the real simple example of a farmer who has to sell corn in the course of his business. He locks in a price using a forward contract because he's not in the business of speculating on commodities. You can imagine a similar situation for a bitcoin business. Granted they can get out of control but they aren't useless.

It seems to have worked well for him. Basically someone can say "I know I'm going to get down votes from all the sheep here" then go on to talk about how great Hitler was and people will up vote them just to show they aren't a sheep. I don't care if this guy is a mod he's posting inaccurate info and basically calling everyone deluded. It's annoying that every comments section is not about the story but some nitpic or accusation about everyone. Then a back and forth over that. I don't think this subreddit is unwilling to acknowledge negative information. If anything it's got way more trolls than other subs and you go in thinking it's going to be one sided but it's really a back and forth with people who are antagonistic.

The weirdest part is the guy accepting bitcoin then asking how to sell them. I'm surprised that didn't raise a red flag for DPR. Like the gang leader is "oh ok I have half a million worth of bitcoin now to launder or do god knows what with.  No big deal."

You seem to be jumping in to the conversation and trying to act like there is some empirical proof on your side that austerity cannot work. And if you don't agree with the original suggestion than you're really just throwing the conversation off track. In the real world there are lots of variables ib economics and it's a leap to say oh we tried that 6 months later "that didn't work." On the logic side let A be spending more than you have. Your solution is A. A caused a problem so I'm reluctant to assume that A is the magic bullet everyone assumes dogmatically that it is.

I think price speculation is good in that it spreads out who is holding the coins. In the long run the more evenly spread the better. However, people buying in out of insane enthusiasm hoping to get rich over night are often the wrong people to bring in. A lot of them conclude its a scam after it falls and become trolls. So I think its a double edged sword.

It's an online version of a Princeton class. It is being taught for credit by Princeton professors for credit and offered for free online for no credit. Basically people from buttcoin engaged in a propaganda campaign to say otherwise and to me that kind of comment and yours detract from quality of this sub.
