I actually wouldn't mind 0.75 MB blocks (768 KB exactly). I hate initial sync times.
Also if everything is pushed off the main blockchain and we can create extra layers hopefully many people having the ability to make nodes and network together easily keeps the network ridiculously strong.

He's the least likely, least deserving millionaire. There are so many people who make a product or offer a brilliant service that deserves to make lots of money but don't quite get there despite effort and good intentions. 
Meanwhile this guy gets there by selling out family, friends, and thousands of people he doesn't know via Mt Gox and elevates himself by stepping on anyone and everyone he can.
And maybe I could forgive that if he wasn't so damn unapologetic and eager to do it again if given the chance.

Ya but if BCH has 0.5 transactions per second what does the 56 limit even mean lol.
EDIT: If BTC had 0.5 transactions per second it would be just as low fee because there's no competition to fit in.

There's definitely not anything like that and if you know what's good for you you'd best not continue to imply some sort of Illumineighty or world domination cult only a privileged, enlightened few can see and use to communicate covertly on thousands of websites around the world such as this one.

He's assuming that coinbase has been working against btc and for bch in some way. It is just an assumption, and I'm wondering about it because it would explain the lack of segwit and only allowing BCH trading, not BCH withdrawals yet which would obviously lead to a pump. They may have also pumped BCH recently knowing the date of the BCH trading release, but that's also an assumption.

Now you see, I can get behind a larger blocksize because LN is delayed. But I CANNOT get behind the shilling, paid-for anti BTC content, insider trading, "I can't break the law because I'm rich", anti-consumer, anti-good faith in crypto, MTGOX puppet that puts himself before anyone else. He's the kind of person who if he was inside that one Batman movie where each boat had to choose to blow up the other, if there was a thousand orphans on one and he was the only one on his boat he would blow up the orphans.

I know there may be technical merits, but for myself personally it's 100% Roger Ver. He sold out with MtGox and it's very easy to see how he PROVED he is all for himself at all times. What has he done to prove he's not the scam artist today that he was then?

I'm just moving to Litecoin. Bitcoin will always be there for me when I want to do real crypto stuff, but when I'm looking to buy or sell in small amounts Litecoin's 2.5 min blocks plus Litecoin fees makes it much more appealing for me.

It's as against the rules as sending someone your paypal address in the game. 
As has been said in this forum over and over again, if something becomes easier for everyone, it also becomes easier for criminals. It's a side effect that can't be avoided but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make transacting easier for everyone.

I can think of a few. What happens if I'm a guild leader and I want to incentivize good behaviour? Going to raids and not swearing, being friendly to other members, etc, gets you BTC and/or gold in an easy to manage fashion. Like a reverse-swearing tip jar.

And yet &gt;95% of people are gender blind and identity blind, and I'm part of that majority. I will not judge you based on your race or gender. The technology itself actually is completely blind.
Let me pose something then. Do you want to judge people based on their identity? And if not, why would it matter?


You are saying forget identity politics, but don't forget identity politics. Please realize that's how this reads.

So, you want us to, for EC multiply disabled tests:
Collect encrypted private key and passphrase from user.
Derive derivedhalf1 and derivedhalf2 by passing the passphrase and addresshash into scrypt function.
Decrypt encryptedhalf1 and encryptedhalf2 using AES256Decrypt, merge them to form the encrypted private key.
Convert that private key into a Bitcoin address, honoring the compression preference specified in flagbyte of the encrypted key record.
Hash the Bitcoin address, and verify that addresshash from the encrypted private key record matches the hash. If not, report that the passphrase entry was incorrect.
And also test EC enabled by:
Collect encrypted private key and passphrase from user.
Derive passfactor using scrypt with ownersalt and the user's passphrase and use it to recompute passpoint
Derive decryption key for seedb using scrypt with passpoint, addresshash, and ownersalt
Decrypt encryptedpart2 using AES256Decrypt to yield the last 8 bytes of seedb and the last 8 bytes of encryptedpart1.
Decrypt encryptedpart1 to yield the remainder of seedb.
Use seedb to compute factorb.
Multiply passfactor by factorb mod N to yield the private key associated with generatedaddress.
Convert that private key into a Bitcoin address, honoring the compression preference specified in the encrypted key.
Hash the Bitcoin address, and verify that addresshash from the encrypted private key record matches the hash. If not, report that the passphrase entry was incorrect.
Now I'm not any good with encryption, but something tells me that would take more than just a few hours.

I was just recently able to get my BTC. There was nothing but copy paste answers from support and the wait times were atrocious. The problem could have been solved months ago when I first submitted a ticket if support was better.
