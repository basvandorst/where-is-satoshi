do any of you guys know how to get my $2000 back?
Coinbase isn't responding 1st of all but now it's been a week and a half and they haven't even refunded my money, they said it would 3 business days, it's been double that..

ok thanks a lot, i tried Circle,  I did all the verifications with them and they sent me an email saying they are unable to provide me with service.  I'm confused with all this verification stuff, I don't understand why it's so tough to get an account I have never been denied an account in my life, my home address is on my drivers license which i uploaded.  I'm not even trying to use bitcoin to do anything weird, i just wanted to open an account to pay some web vendors who only want bitcoin like $150 each to 2 vendors but it seems i've spent more time trying to open an account then it's worth.   I will try Gemini and hopefully someone at Coinbase will respond to me, it's now been about 10 days since i emailed them with no response. I also PM'd several different customer service reps here and they haven't responded so I have no idea what's going on.

Gemini?  ok, who else might you recommend?  Are there any companies that are a bit more open and realistic with all these security measures?  You're right i should have started small, i wanted to use a credit card but Coinbase credit card feature wouln't work even for $40 and now they've dropped my limit to $5 .

sorry i did not know,  i tried what you said, where would you recommend?  r/coinbase is moderated, you can't submit without prior approval and if you try and post in the community it actually take you out of reddit and to the help section on the coinbase website,  it seems r/coinbase is basically managed by the coinbase company and is not an open forum managed by reddit

I signed up for Coinbase and had a purchase completely cancelled after verifying my driver's license, social security number, address, phone number, bank account and credit card.  I also waited the full 7 days,  They sent me an email to verify my information but it was already verified.  I sent them 2 emails and there has been no response in many days now.  It seems Coinbase is just like Paypal and they need to verify and report everything to the government these days but there is no phone support or anything.  It is very disappointing.  They have debited my bank account for $2000.
