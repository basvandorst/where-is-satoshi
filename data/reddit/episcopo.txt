You and other 'helpers' are dumb. Strange that on bitcointalk forum they did not have any issues with me and helped immediteally.

Solved by downloading newest version of Electrum, backing up the old wallet and seed from the old version and then logging in to the new version. And it was there. Also know the reason, their web page says:  Warning: Electrum versions older than 3.3 can no longer connect to public servers, and must be upgraded. 
Guys at bitcointalk org forum helped me out immediatelly. Thanks for that.

Oh, sorry, I made a mistake, should I be killed or should someone at the subreddit dedicated to bitcoin help me?

Yeah, thanks, I got actual help at bitcointalk forum, you can see my newest update. And [archive.org]( is not a weird domain at all, you do not know about web archives? Accessing old versions of sites? Nevermind.

I basically just used the old version, but definitely official.
Downloaded from an internet archive, that is why it is old.

Let me guess, you rather pick on people than actually try to help like the guys at the bitcoin talk forum. And the problem is SOLVED now, you did not see that? You do not need to contribute with any other special comments of yours.
As I said, the site WAS NOT accessible atm so I went to web archive. Google does the same thing by the way. Lol. Knows bitcoins and does not know anything about website archiving.

Tutorial for electrum was not accessible at the time so i had to use web archive, do you have any actual help please?
