It’s only like 44 bucks if it hits 50k. I give people the smaller alts hoping they can 10x or more.

I do all my BRC transactions with replaceable fees in the electim wallet. Shit goes thru within minutes. 24 hours isdefinitely bull. Ask for the tx id.

ETH is on the Bloomberg terminal :)

Oh my god, Monero advocates for privacy.....clearly we're all criminals and supporting other criminals.

THe lowest one. It’ll get mined, just might take a while. But hats ok since you aren’t in any hurry.

Where do you see this?  The account hasn't spent any of it's BTC at all.  And the 53K BTC was sent to the account in 2014.  Its very possible that these keys are long gone.

I dunno....  My company went public two years ago.  When pundits weren't interested, our stock didn't move.  Soon as they started saying its a buy, then boom...price shot up.  Quarterly reports have looked good since we've gone public so the only thing I can imagine is the added exposure from pundits mentioning the stock.  
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:09:05
Valid point.  If the same car is recovered then I would fully expect you to get it back.  I personally would want my BTC back, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if the course went solely on teh value of BTC at the time of the incident.  Totally fucked, but that basically sums our our court system....

You potentially have another super shady character at the helm of a MASSIVE name in the crypto space.  Thats not really good for anyone.  Doing something is definitely better than nothing....I still don't know what that something is, but I know I should do it.
@_date: 2019-03-19 23:52:02
no shit.  how tf is this getting upvoted?  this is less useful than all those price prediction articles that people submit
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:07:58
How long have you been going?  I assume you haven't hit the lotto yet?  Any idea what the odds are?
@_date: 2019-03-05 03:10:18
Negative.  You get the value in cash.  If a thief steals your car, the court doesn't order the thief to give you another car....

I wonder how realistic it might be if we said someone is gearing up for a serious 51% attack. Nothing is too big. Though that does seem absolutely insane, it’s definitely not impossible. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:33:23
I set a buy order in the 6500 range.  We'll see just how right you are :)  
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:22:22
The most extreme case of FUD I’ve seen this week. Congrats. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:35:37
I don’t think you’ll be seeing that price again.  But I sure hope we do!  I have a buy order set for 5600. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:41:49
Agreed on all accounts.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:47:26
On an exchange like Gemini/bittrex it’s the default purchase type. You type in the price you want along with the amount of coins. Then it goes into the order book until someone is willing to sell at the price you’ve asked for.   Coinbase doesn’t do them. Which exchange do you use?  
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:58:49
Lol I can’t believe I wasted 6 seconds of my life reading that shit. Fucking hell im an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:58:28
Mobile messed that up.  There arne't spaces.  It should be peanutbuttergoodness+bitmain
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:46:06
Isn't that the point of a public key?  With PKI/SSL it doesn't matter if you reveal the public key.  Why does it matter with bitcoin?  I clearly have some reading to do :)

Upnp is shit. Statically map the port on your router. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:13:20
Can you explain why you shouldnt reuse addresses?  
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:56:19
How is that any different from losing your wallet containing your cash?  What’s lost is lost. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:47:07
Lol. Here we go again
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:33:21
You can do this with gmail as well. Add a +&lt;company&gt; before the @ in your address. So an example is....  peanutbuttergoodness+bitmain

The reason Delta is the best app is because you don't have to pair a coin with another coin.  You can pair to USD.  I mine, I swap BTC for ETH, and I swap other coins for ETH.  I can't even figure out how I'd input my mined ETH as theres no USD pairing.  I need to be able to say I paid $0 for &lt;x&gt; coin.  
I tried, but this app just doesn't work for me in its current state.  Looks good though.  Nice work so far.
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:28:42
Proof?? I have a friend that wired almost 100k to Gemini and bought coin. No issues at all.

Are we just going to post all the currencies that have seen inflation now?  And pretend like it's still original
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:55:49
Bitcoin being 20k seemed absurd to me....that shit happened though.
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:22:42
You should ABSOLUTELY write stuff down so that someone besides you can access your coin in the scenarios you specified. Physical security of this is obviously uber important. Probably not something you store at home.
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:57:24
How would this ever work?  Buying my first bitcoins was a huge pain in the ass and super confusing...  You could find 5,000 wallets and never get a single bitcoin in return....
