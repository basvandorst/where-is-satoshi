I don't think this is true. Fiat money is a store of value, no matter how much you don't like fiat.
Gold, real estate and even some forms of IP are a store of value.

Yes, but this value loss is slow enough that people have fiat savings and this serves them well. The Wikipedia article on the topic gives ample explanation as to the difference. Bitcoin is more like company shares, way too volatile to be store of value.
I also gave you examples of other stores of value. The point is that I disagree with your assessment that according to store of value definition nothing is store of value. Yes, the value of anything can change. Question is - how fast.
