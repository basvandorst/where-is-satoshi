They're still just guessing. Not saying it's bad to have that info (any information about a system is good to monitor) but that there are more reliable metrics to see it's comparison to other networks.

that's why I said "had one big 1000 bitcoin chunk" meaning I had previously received 1000 bitcoins in one go so that my next transaction would have to use those unused inputs.

I wonder if a useful add on to firefox and chrome as something that alerts you when you're on a site that has a slightly different spelling than sites that you normally go on or maybe it has a list that you can edit as to sites where it will warn you if it's slightly different. 
So say you have tdcanadatrust.com on the list, when it sees you browse to tdcanandatrust.com it will alert you.

This isn't really a good measure. If I was to send you .001 btc from my wallet that had one big 1000 bitcoin chuck (I wish!!!)  it would count as a massive 1000 bitcoin transaction, whereas it's really only sending .001 not 1000. I think the more important metric is average transactions per second.
