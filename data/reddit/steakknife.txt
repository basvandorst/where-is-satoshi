The AdultKing mentioned in the article posts about his exploits on [gfy.com]( Some people have mentioned Bitcoin to him but he dismisses it as a pipe dream. This was my favourite quote: 






[Taken from this thread](
He also says in another thread (in a mocking tone) that Kim Dotcom will have to accept Bitcoin on his new site because no payment processor would risk their reputation on him.

The Issuer checks that the vouchers are still on the active circulation list (this prevents double spending)
If there are no problems, the Issuer assigns new serial numbers for the output amounts and sends this information to the Publisher
**The Publisher acknowledges the Issuer and makes the new signed vouchers using the new serial number, while the Issuer retires the old serial numbers and adds the new serial number and amount to its active circulation list.**
Does this mean the Issuer retires old serial numbers and makes new ones for each transaction i.e. destroying and issuing new electronic cash each time money changes hands? If so then the Issuer will have to know who owns the new serial numbers if they are to remain AML compliant.

Why would you want to get to know her? All guys want to do is look at high quality pictures of a beautiful woman. The fact that she is 17 isn't relevant. I find your holier than thou attitude difficult to believe coming from a 28 year old. 
@_date: 2012-07-18 13:56:57
There is nothing creepy about what she is doing. Her modelling portfolio is not pornographic and she is 17 years old which according to Wikipedia is above the age of consent in the vast majority of countries.

Have you been advertising on Bitcointalk? At the moment that is the centre of the Bitcoin universe so you need to get a lively thread started there advertising your products. There is a guy called Flaxceed in the marketplace subforum who sells medicines for bitcoins. The thread that he updates is a good example of how to sell stuff to us Bitcoiners. If you have issues with posting NSFW pictures on the forum you could ask the moderators to start an adult subforum. 
Edit: I've had a look at the stuff that you're selling on Bitmit. I see lots of vibrators and dildos. That's all well and good but since 95% of Bitcoiners are men, perhaps you should sell flesh-lights too ;)

They only keep encrypted copies of your private keys meaning they don't have access to your funds. Plus you can keep backups of the private keys allowing you to move your funds to another service anytime you want. I'd call them a convenient interface to the Bitcoin network rather than a centralised service.

Do you believe what she is doing is porn?
edit: I suppose porn is very subjective. I'm going to stop debating this. If you don't like it that's fair enough but please stop calling people who want to use the site creepy. 
second edit: Actually porn isn't subjective. There are fairly well defined guidelines amongst courts/film censors around the world about what is considered pornographic. The only place where this might be considered porn is some strict Islamic country.

You can be sure unfettered access to SWIFT costs a lot more than the quoted EUR 10k. Their pricing structure is probably similiar to a Ryanair flight!

Was this an online purchase or in real life? Did the vendor specifically say he wanted 1 confirmation before the sale was finalised?
Personally I'd be happy with a zero confirmation transaction because I think miners are very unlikely to be complicit in a double spend attempt. I can't think of a reason why miners would allow something to happen that jeopardises their business model. 
@_date: 2013-02-11 12:57:38


No. Miners won't produce blocks that are too big to propagate around the network within a 10 minute window.

Forget about using the Cypriot banking system to buy bitcoins. It's over - finished! Their credit is no longer any good and it's time you started positioning yourself in the post euro Cyprus. 
Start listing things for sale on Bitmit. Doesn't matter what exactly but make sure they're competitively priced and then start advertising this as far and wide as possible. It's the type of story the press could really get into. You could become the defacto Cyprus Bitcoin expert overnight and get your face on all the tv channels. 
Things might seem hopeless at the moment but don't let this crisis pass you by.

Suppose I wanted to hire a massive botnet to try a double spend on the Bitcoin and Litecoin networks. Because there is less time between Litecoin blocks I wouldn't have to hire the botnet for as long if I wanted to mine 6 blocks in a row than if I wanted to mine 6 Bitcoin blocks in a row (all other things being equal of course). In that sense a shorter confirmation time is less secure because it requires less resources to mine competing blocks. Think about it as it approaches the limit and it will make sense i.e. would you trust a one second interval between blocks?
I think people are getting needlessly hung up about zero confirmation transactions. A zero confirmation transaction can only be double spent if a large miner accepted a second transaction with the same inputs. I can't think of a reason why a miner would help undermine a system from which he is making money.

Many mortgage holders in Ireland have stopped making repayments because they know that banks won't try to repossess. The EU have been making noises about this so it's likely there might be a change of attitude fairly soon. A ton of firesale properties flooding the market will be dire for bank balance sheets. 
Expect Irish banks to beg for more money soon.

As far as I'm aware EU regulations only allow you to open a personal account in a country that you reside in but after the account has been opened you can leave the country but still keep the account. For business accounts you'd need to form a business entity in the country.

No the standard mining software won't accept a double spend transaction (even if it has a higher fee than the first). It's like a code of honour amongst the miners - once a transaction is in their memory pool they won't accept another transaction which uses the same "coins".
Of course there is nothing actually stopping a miner from deleting the first transaction from their memory pool and accepting the double spend transaction but like I said that would make the miner complicit. 
(This is all presuming miners are well connected to the network)
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:32:26
Yes I'm sorry I did misunderstand you. If you're interested in tracing transaction inputs and outputs all the way back through the blockchain then in that sense Bitcoin is one hundred percent traceable. 


You brushed over the enormity of that somewhat. Simple steps such as using coin mixers or swapping coins between alt-chains can make the job of linking addresses to people impossible. That was the type of traceability that I meant.

I think there's still a market for HD quality scenes on demand. Porn sites need to look at Bitcoin and see what kind of new business models it could allow. For example I think paying 50 cents for 30 minutes of access to a site would be pretty cool. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:55:25
I see what you meant now. My double spend strategy was to let the original transaction propagate and then send out a second with a higher fee hoping a dishonest miner will accept it. 
Sending out a simultaneous double spend can be easily spotted by a well connected merchant.

I think the 3.99% fee is a bit steep. Your main competition in Ireland will be Bitstamp. Using a SEPA transfer I can already send money to them next day for free and only pay a 0.5% trading fee when buying coins. 
If you allow cash deposits to your accounts that could entice people to pay your higher fee.

The 2.5 minute block interval still isn't fast enough for everyday use. The future will either be a smart crypto trick which allows fairly secure zero secure confirmation transactions or payment gateways such as ripple where most transactions are off the main chain.

Accepting bitcoins would open up new revenue models for porn. Imagine a site that charged 50 cents for 20 minutes of access to their library of scenes. I'd guess it would be a popular impulsive purchase that would be repeated often ;)

I live in the western world (London, UK) and I'm witnessing +5% inflation all around. Food, train, electricity and gas are all up over 5% year on year. Bus travel is up 4%. I could go on but I don't want to depress myself. The only thing which allows the government to fake the inflation figure of around 2% is all the discretionary plastic crap imported from China which unfortunately I can't eat or use to keep me warm.
