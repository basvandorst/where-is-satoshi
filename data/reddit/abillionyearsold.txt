Oh cool so this guy's opinion matters now that he agrees with you but before it didn't, right? Nice. LOL

The 4000 upvotes and the fact that it has been the top post on your subreddit for several hours, and one of the few posts from your subreddit to make it to &gt; It didn't matter then, doesn't matter now.
Clearly it does, because you guys are publicizing it and praising him. 


Lol wait so there are bitcoin devotes that believe this? Hasn't the massive number of publicly known scams shown you that they are just trying to usurp the bankers? In other words, don't you realize that Bitcoin is an incredibly abuse-prone scene? How are you ignoring that to talk about bankers?

Jesus christ... THIS IS WHAT YOU MORONS WANTED. You asked, nay, begged for a lack of regulation: this is what it looks like. 
People smarter than you taking all of your shit with you having no recourse.

What type of helicopter did you purchase? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:26:11
Where is your personal island, exactly?

Oh... my bad I thought bitcoin actually made you fabulously wealthy and you purchased a helicopter. 
I guess because that's what you implied... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:35
Right but the real helicopter you bought with your real bitcoin profits, which did you go for? An MH-1? A Safari? X505?

You honestly think you're going to make a bunch of money the banks could otherwise make? You actually think you're beating them somehow? 
You don't even know who owns any bitcoins. Nobody does. You guys are getting taken for a ride.

Your ethical currency choice is bitcoin? Really? Jesus Christ... 
Dude all you are doing is giving the big banks and a few financial elites money. That is all anyone who is on this subreddit is doing. Because if you are on here you aren't a real player. You're not even fucking close. Without a super computer and an office in New York City, you're never going to get into their world. 
And trust me asshole, it is in fact *their* fucking world.

Lol it is still a scam no matter what the value is. In fact, wildly fluctuating values is part of what makes it a scam you idiots. 
But yeah keep enriching other people and pretending. You do you. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:46:08
hahahaha - dude all that is happening is you guys are going to get ridden into the ground on a bubble by the banks just like every other bubble. Why do you guys honestly think you've found something new? 
Neither you nor anyone else has any idea who controls any number of coins. You can't know any of the things you'd need to know to actually generate anything real or lasting. 
This is essentially the exact same thing as the Dotcom bubble just with a slightly different group of people with a slightly different attitude behind it. It's a bunch of bullshit money tied into something that is never going to work and all that will happen is a few people who got in early are going to make the vast majority of the money and dip. 
Bitcoin isn't special. You're not special. This is the same story that has played out time and time again with every bubble ever. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:01:39
If you don't want to get into their world, you should stop pretending you know anything about finance and get out of crypto while it is still beneficial for you. 
I promise you, it won't be forever. 
There will be a bigger idea, there will be a better idea, and the people who put everything into bitcoin are just going to enrich a few of the same elites that everyone else is enriching. You wanna know the real difference? You're choosing to enrich them, I'm being forced to.

You're the one that wanted to talk shit :)
