Thanks guys for clearing this up for me!

IMHO, no way.  Cryptocurrency isn't like Ebay where all we care about is best of brand.  Monero and Ethereum, for example, have quite different purposes and reasons for existing than bitcoin.  Just like the physical world has many options to transfer and store wealth/value, so it will be with cryptocurrencies.

This might be what I was missing all along.  I didn't' realize this was possible.  I found this link:   Thanks!

Thanks Sandwich.  I appreciate the guidance.  This thread has opened my eyes.  I thought I understood a thing or two.  I'm playing around with bitaddress.org on my AGM.  Speaking of which.  I bet in the future when a thief breaks into your house, they leave the $3000 Retina Mac on the desk, and grab the windows xp laptop instead.  Obvious AGM!
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:29:11
Ah, I see.  Totally understand.  Thank you!
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:10:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:12:45
What software does this?
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:33:51
THANKS! Air gapped machine  and Electrum.  Downloaded last night.  Will play around with it. 
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:30:49
Gotcha!  Thanks for explaining this.  This crypto stuff is so fun.  It's almost like I'm still living in my parents basement in my early twenties writing my own D&amp;D modules :) LOL!  Well not that much fun ;)
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:04:37
LOL! 
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:23:31
Oh wow.  Tricky little scoundrel!  This is the wild west.   Typo my butt!
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:35:12
Agreed.  Unless he bought it super cheap and then fell into a coma.
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:17:42
Excellent post!  Thank you.  And this gets to the spirit of my question.  So it seems wise, that if you were a super early entrant into Bitcoin, as you watched your initial address skyrocket in value you should have repeatedly subdivided into more addresses as often as necessary as the value grew.  This way you never had any single address worth more than say a few thousand USD.  
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:15:55
But ultimately you're still trusting a wallet service correct?  What about the axiom "If you don't own the private keys, you don't own the coin?"
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:10:47
Wow, great replies. Thank you guys.  So apparently I have more studying to do.  Perhaps I've been reading old posts, but I thought once you reveal your private key in order to withdraw from the address, it is now compromised.  So what I'm hearing is that wallets and signatures etc are 100% safe.  
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:31:35
Roger that!
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:59:17
Solutions to these challenges forthcoming - certainly.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:17:27
Thanks you for the insight!  I mostly bought in because I had some beat up IRAs that I couldn't possibly do any worse with.  Figured what the hey.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:00:24
Not really fair.  Look at the chart leading up to the Mt Gox catastrophe.  Furthermore if you did sell your coin at a significant loss after the Gox crash, you WERE a weak hand, because you'd have gotten everything back by holding in just a few years longer.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:15:27
Gotta be what it is then.  Wonder if I could get hurt being pretty heavily invested in GBTC if COIN goes through?  Albeit I'm in at a pretty good price.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:49:39
Those of you selling now after this beating have been what's called: 'Shaken Out'  It's not pretty.  An emotional decision acted upon because of a fear of losing what's left.  You're selling low.  You're selling low because that's what people who lose money do.  This is currently a multi-Billion dollar asset class. It's the first real money the world has ever seen than didn't take wheel barrels to move around. It's grossly undervalued and isn't going anywhere.  This drama is a natural part of growing pains that frankly should have been expected; it will get sorted out.  Hold your coins, or hold your head in your hands someday soon.

What I like about brainwallet.io is that in the absence of the website, or a copy of it, I can ressurect my private keys using this   program.  More importantly I can verify that brainwallet.io is giving me correct output, because the scrypt test gives the same output.  I like warpwallet too, perhaps better because it uses a secondary pbkdf2 algorithm in addition to scrypt:
s1	=	scrypt(key=(passphrase||0x1), salt=(salt||0x1), N=2^18, r=8, p=1, dkLen=32)
s2	=	pbkdf2(key=(passphrase||0x2), salt=(salt||0x2), c=2^16, dkLen=32, prf=HMAC_SHA256)
keypair	=	generate_bitcoin_keypair(s1 ⊕ s2)
But for the life of me I can't figure out how to achieve the same output independent of the warpwallet html itself, which would give me that warm fuzzy.
Can anyone break down these s1 and s2 processes in plain english?  Thanks guys!

Thank you riplin.  Taking your advice I've tried to piece it together but I think I'm out of my element here big time.  Probably silly anyway.  They also add an 0x1 and 0x2 byte to the Passphrase and salt for scrypt and pbkdf2 respectively, which is throwing me for a loop. Guess that's why they call it cryptography.  Time to go back to college ;)
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:06:21
Please explain developments that could render bitcoin "not scarce at all."  Like I said.  I'm a noob.  Just learning.
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:59:36
Very important observation. Thank you!   But don't forget about all the other currencies which Bitcoin could take small, or perhaps even large marketshare from.  There is something pure, something beautiful about the genius behind this thing.  I can't help it I'm twitter-pated big-time. Must be smart, not impulsive. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:08:16
Good point.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:55:22
After about an hour it went away for me.
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:06:59
Really appreciate the insightful reply 2cool2fish!
@_date: 2015-11-21 16:47:03
Gotcha!  Thank you so much for the reply - I will take your advice.  I honestly am practically giving it away if someone wants to use Bitcoin.   ;)
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:07:55
Happening to me right now.  Normal manual user.  Did anyone else's finally start working?
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:18:54
Ha!  No, but that's ok.  I did get little XMR once tho :) :)   I usually tip a little when something benefits me so I felt like - hey I'll throw up some addresses for fun.   No worries either way.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:28:22
I think it would be cool to have a metric showing total cost basis of all investors in Bitcoin.  Probably too late to ever know that, but it would give a true understanding of the real amount of fiat that's been converted.  This would tell us in very real terms what Bitcoin is worth.  Market Cap is meaningless - I agree.  However I just read an article where some smart dude was able to pin an 'earnings' style value to Bitcoin based on it's usefulness to store and move money with little friction and zero trust required.  I've always felt that's where the real value is too.
