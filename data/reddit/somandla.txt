There are fundamentals that apply across all investments or al...ahem... commodities. Bitcoin's only value should be derived from its anti inflationary characteristic. It has obviously sidestepped becoming a medium of exchange since the high transaction fees have put paid to that.
Also, perhaps most importantly crowd psychology is at play here and history is full of "new" inventions where crowd psychology ignored fundamentals of value
The fact that bitcoin is now considered a commodity rather than a currency (as it was supposed to be)  due to widespread hodling shows there's too much speculative interest and to little transactional motive.

If people think Bitcoin is underpriced then Ethereum is seriously underpriced. I would put half on bitcoin and half on ethereum. Never have all your eggs in one basket as some are going to find out in the near future.

How can BTC be a currency when it is being used as a commodity. BTC is a commodity that can be exchanged for currency. At the moment it is a currency in name only. Whoever uses it as a currency at current transaction fees must very desperate or uber wealthy. All commodity prices need to obey fundamental supply/demand laws. Bitcoin supply is artificially constrained while demand is mainly speculative (vs transactional) in intent. Anyone can see this is a bubble.

All currencies get manipulated its up to you to spot the value discrepancy and buy/sell accordingly. The BUY signal should be flashing for you right now

I'm not pumping anything, just stating the obvious actually. It's a times like these where the profits are made, how else can you buy low and sell high if the price never goes low

You don't sell/buy in a panic

Could ony go up now, people underestimate the usefulness of bitcoin to merchants and customers

Buffet most certainly makes long term momentum or price action decision otherwise why bother investing if your investment will not even beat inflation. The low-cost nature of Bitcoin is its "productivity", thats where the value is so you can't say Bitcoin in non-productive when it actually produces cost savings in transactions

Being an African I got in for the cheap transaction fees which allowed me to bypass SWIFT and foreign exchange controls. It was so liberating to be able to pay for international services cheaply &amp; quickly. Needless to say the transaction fees are too high now and hence the major reason I got into Bitcoin has been eliminated

Time value of money(compound interest) makes the profit target much higher than your original investment, hopefully you will hold for the long term as I suspect Bitcoin will keep going up

Thank you bujka for some reason the transaction has now dissapeared from my wallet after 28 hours in limbo. The blockchain was saying "The transaction has been rejected by our node Reason: Transaction was previously accepted but has been pruned from our database.
Is the malleability attack specific to me, I dont trust Mycelium anymore and why are my transactions not broadcasting.

Duh the beginning of quantitative easing in Europe is the reason bitcoin price is shooting up. People see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation due to its deflationary properties. Remember Bitcoin started falling around about the time America stopped quantitative easing.
