But lots of companies tumble their coins. 
At what point is it illegal?
Regardless of possible motives,
No one needs to wash them unless they are hiding something. (?)
So is all tumbling of bitcoins illegal?

I feel like trying to regulate tumbling of bitcoins would be nearly impossible.

Also.  In a matter of speaking. Couldn't bitcoins be considered more of a barter situation vs a currency situation. 
In that way, is it illegal to wash your "barter."?
Here is a hypothetical situation. 
Imagine bitcoins are actually cows.  
Now. You know a guy who will sell you his car for 3 cows.  Your cows all have an id tag that says they are yours. 
You take them to a cow tumbler. 
Guy puts your cows in a pen with 50 other cows. Then gives you 3 of the mix. 
They now have different id tags not related to you. 
You then buy the car. 
Maybe the car was a stolen car. 
But why should that be on the guy who had the pen and "tumbled" your cows?
That's not on him what you spent the cows on. 
The cows aren't "real money". 
So how could the rancher tumbler be charged with money laundering?

The law doesn't say anything about "mediums of currency". Only mentions actual money. 
At least from what I can find

28 female. Besides working full time I am working on my BA in psych at a local state university. 
Never invested in anything though I have a company 401k.  
Just seems like a good idea to buy as much BTC as I can at the moment.

Honestly. It's not a bad idea to secure your primary wallet with your real name and phone number or any other security verification you can use.  
Use bitcoinfog to make your BTC anonymous before it goes into your BMR account.  Btw. Stay away from Sherps marketplace. It's a clusterfuck atm

I saw this too. And I was thinking the same thing. 
That the crash is due in part by SM scammer selling some coins at unbelievably low low prices somewhere. And the influx of trade and low price would drag the value down right?
I mean. That's a possibility I think.  
If my assessment is flawed. Maybe someone can explain why.

I think its fair to say that the fall of SM and the closing of BMR has some effect, though not as drastic as SR closing.
