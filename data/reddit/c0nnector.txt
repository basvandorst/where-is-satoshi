I mean, if you have that many bitcoins you can probably bypass the exchange and find private buyers(investors, hedge funds etc...)

Oh shit, here we go again.   
Between people taking loans and grandparents asking about bitcoin we're bound to see some action soon.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:28:13
I mean, what did you expect? Coinbase is a regulated entity.  
Ideally we should do transactions without middlemen but we're not there yet.

In a way it makes Bitcoin more legit and i guess Satoshi knew that. If you can attack the person, you can attack Bitcoin.
Also, it's more poetic.
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:21:40
See if they have any ETFs on bitcoin in your country, maybe that's the best way for you to get in.
It's funny though, bitcoin is supposed to transcend banks &amp; borders and yet here we are.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:37:34
Shitcoin indicates they are worthless whereas altcoin is not indicative enough.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:34:22
"cashing out" means you have to pay tax. If you left a trace with your name on it, ie from Coinbase, then you're playing with fire because IRS is tracking it.

Bitcoin was never meant for criminal activity or privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:30:34
Usually, you need to realize your gains in order to pay tax. In the case of bitcoin it can be in the form of 1) using it as a currency or 2) converting it to fiat.
Also, checkout EU and local laws regarding bitcoin.

How i imagine the [exchange](

@_date: 2019-11-02 22:36:37
Theoretically it could be used for p2p messaging (just text) without the need of ISPs by creating a mesh network, or am i missing something?

Sure, what i had in mind was a local wide network that people can communicate with, without the need to access the www.
If messages and financial transactions can be exchanged without ISP access then that's a huge win.

While we're at it, why store your coins in a wallet when i can store them safely for you - Free of charge! mail:coinstore
@_date: 2019-02-11 22:56:45
At some point you'll make a transaction that is traceable to you. 
Say you buy a TV with bitcoin then you'll probably provide a physical address. And if they really wanted to find you then they could associate ips/sites/usernames/transactions.

Buy high, sell low. Works every time
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:35:35
That's a good strategy with any investment. Find underpriced assets and get in early, when everyone is buying and you see huge jumps like 20% then you consider selling.

Doubt it. Governments will be more and more involved, they already monitor all major exchanges to make sure you pay your taxes.
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:00:36


That's what i've realized as well. There are many arguments why other altcoins may be better but the truth is the majority of people don't care.  
Bitcoin has huge brand equity and the more it stays the more people trust it.
@_date: 2019-12-25 12:11:50
I think you let ideology cloud your view. Can't say if price is where it's supposed to be but the global store of value is real.

Lot's of ifs in there.
I think that the [Lindy effect]( can be used to "predict" the life expectancy of Bitcoin. Basically when it comes to complex systems such as this one, the more time it survives the more robust it's considered.

Coinbase is an exchange, you don't have to keep your crypto there. With Revolut you can't transfer it to a wallet.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:05:45
Maybe we have to rethink how we use money online.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:02:13
You can't have it both ways. BTC is designed so you own your money, not the bank.
The same ability that allows banks to give you back your stolen money allows them to lock your account or limit your transactions.
With that said, we have to create an environment that is secure enough and yet user friendly which is very hard to do.
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:03:52
Is there any other way?
@_date: 2019-04-11 18:24:56
In Revolut you don't own your coins/tokens.
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:11:19
Honestly, Coinbase is the least shady exchange i could find. Every other exchange i read about bitcoins "magically" disappear along with the founders.

If you plan to HODL:
\- Don't use leverage/loans/more than you can handle.
\- Ask yourself if you would be ok if the price dropped to 0.
\- Check the price every week, not day. News and opinions will swing your mood up and down, keep it under control.
@_date: 2019-01-20 11:30:48

That's because all these analysts and bloggers are making baseless assumptions.
Truth is we don't know what's gonna happen, like with most things in life, but all we can do is support the direction we choose and be optimistic. If you think Bitcoin can can make a change, and there's a chance it works out, then that's that.
Stop listening to those idiots.
