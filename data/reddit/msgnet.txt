There is no way. There is nothing to stop someone from sitting on a private key for decades before deciding to move her coins. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:14:54
What's wrong with having a strong opinion on the matter?
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:54:39
Doing the work of confirming transactions is not waste, it's serving a useful purpose. All the servers at Visa &amp; MasterCard that handle your purchases are not *wasting* energy.
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:59:50
Again, you wouldn't even know the transactions are occurring, so there's no issue about distaste, mental costs, pain in the ass factor, etc. As for minimum size transaction costs, you could use something like sidechains.
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:28:13
If people hate microtransactions, then Bitcoin is perfect, because the transactions can occur in the background passively. See 21.co. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:58:37
It is just surprising the confidence you can have that something will not succeed given such limited information.
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:27:12
The company. What they're doing. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:52:18
Half a penny a day at current price levels. But the idea is also that there will be so many devices in the IoT, those half pennies will add up.
And do you really think the investors would hand over $120M, some of it from their own personal fortunes, and not know that the difficulty level would increase? Do you think the guys running the company did not know about difficulty levels? C'mon. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:11:50
Smh. I'm saying the investors were surely aware about increases in difficulty, because if you spend more than 5 mins thinking about it, that would be the obvious concern. 
Does that mean I think


Of course not. That's nonsense reasoning right there. Have fun. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 07:36:33
It's $100k. The company does like $400M in quarterly revenue. No worries. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:50:29
But the energy used is not wasted, it's performing a useful function. The energy used is confirming transactions on the bitcoin network.
You have to compare the mining energy used to the sum of all energy used by our current financial transaction system and other systems that bitcoin could replace. That number is not zero. Think of all the servers run by Visa, MasterCard, and the big banks, all the energy it takes to power ATMs in little air conditioned rooms, all the energy it takes to produce thousands of little plastic cards and physically transport them to people, the energy it takes to carry the junk mail away to a landfill.

If 21 has some early success, they will face fierce global competition. They're not operating in a vacuum.
@_date: 2015-06-24 07:28:21
This only makes sense if you think 21 will *never* face competition from other big-pocketed investors *around the globe*. As soon as 21 Inc starts to have a little success, they will face fierce competition. And all the while the network gets stronger from the additional computing power companies are throwing into mining.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:06:18


We'll see. The script hasn't been written yet. Micropayment channels may be the path forward, maybe not. You're like the guy in 2000 going "eh, this Google company will never make a dime."
You might be right, but not for any good reason. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 02:29:08
That's like saying the amount of gold I can give you is limited by the amount of gold that exists in the world. True, but really doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:34:41
Gold is used widely in electronics because it is highly conductive but doesn't rust, oxidize, or otherwise corrode like other metals. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:57:46
Because one day a few satoshis could be worth, I don't know, a buck? And then if you have millions of users that's real money.

Google is not winning mobile payments. NFC is dead.

But that means supply has the leverage. If you hold bitcoins you can effectively bitch slap the people who are demanding bitcoins by charging a higher price.

Memespam. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:14:46
I prefer the terminology millicoins over millibits. So the units I would use are milli-bitcoins, or millicoins for short, microcoins, and microcents (or satoshis). I think microcents sounds better than satoshis. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:46:34
Why would Bitcoin follow the Nasdaq?
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:10:15
Yeah, if those fraudulent bitcoin businesses were regulated they'd be forced to take a government bailout to save them from failure.

He's just saying that a truckload of academic papers, awards, achievements, and fancy titles aren't worth squat when a game-changing technology comes out of nowhere and turns your field on its head.

CoinValidation could harm the fungibility of Bitcoin, i.e. the principle that all units of a currency are indistinguishable and can be mutually substituted. The fungibility would be broken because businesses or entities would only accept some Bitcoins and not others.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:14:24
What happened to the hash rate all of a sudden? Dropped by over 75%. The block time is up to 34 minutes.
The hash rate has been quite volatile over the last month or so which is a little bit disconcerting. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:39:10
If Bitcoin amounts to just a replacement for gold amongst investors, that would be highly disappointing (though still lucrative for bitcoin holders).

The developer is a well known guy with ties to the Coinbase CEO and Airbnb. Not some guy off the street.

That's pretty weak. It happens to be correlated since May.

He said it wasn't a problem for bitcoin, not that it wasn't a problem for Gox. And he was correct. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 11:19:28
Makes no sense. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:51:14
Bitcoin is going to take off when people don't even realize they're using it. 99% of people using the Internet today don't have a clue what TCP/IP is, but they're all using it. In the future (near future, hopefully), people are going to be doing all kinds of creative stuff with money and not even realize that bitcoin is the protocol running underneath it all.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:07:11
I din't know anybody who uses Google Wallet and I have never seen anybody use it. So I guess put our stories together and you have 50% adoption rate. Not bad!
A few people here use LevelUp, but that's about it as far as mobile payments.

Not if you wanted to buy more coins.

VCs do spend hundreds of millions on failed experiments. The vast majority of VC backed companies fail.

Why do you even need him to install Coinbase first? I think you can just send to an email address and he will get an email from Coinbase who will hold the bitcoins until the user opens the account.
Or better yet, hand him a private key on a piece of paper and say this key is worth bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:49:44
If that is the case, then I am in full support of BitLicense in NY. Not on principle, but because of this unintended effect. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:14:12
If that's your principle worry, convert your pay over to gold immediately. Don't need bitcoin to solve this problem. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:03:26
All regulations have good intentions. Results, however, a mixed bag.

First of all, Bitcoin, or bitcoin. Definitely not "BitCoin."
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:21:10
That is supposedly one thing 21 figured out. Their mining tech is scalable down to the level of generating a few satoshis. So you don't need size to make a profit, but you do need size to make any appreciable income (at today's price levels). 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:56:11
The word censoring has been so misused in this debate. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:25:26
I don't give the regulators that much credit. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 01:44:45
What's this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:45:06
Maybe they will, but the security relative to Bitcoin will be nil. Because a new currency starting out won't have the hashing power behind it. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 22:42:23
What's the incentive to exercise the proof of work if there's no currency to earn? My friends and I can set up our own distributed ledger validated by proof of work on our measly laptops, but that's not really more secure than a shared Google spreadsheet. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 23:07:02
That's not what anyone here said. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 09:55:12
Yeah, what we need is a closed loop, where you buy something from Overstock using bitcoin, Overstock pays its supplier using bitcoin, the supplier pays its supplier in bitcoin, who pays its employees in bitcoin, who buy stuff from Overstock in bitcoin. Not there yet.

It's not the title of the patent that matters, it's the claims. The claims could be specific to a detail you don't know about.

Let's say you have some digital asset related to IoT. Think really small - could be your heart rate, temperature of your house, a live view of the street corner outside your window. This data is virtually worthless on an individual scale, but it might be valuable to somebody on a mass scale. All this data could be useful for research, science, or for developing new products. There was previously no incentive for you to offer anyone something for sale for 0.5 cents (other than your attention to ads, but put that aside for now). But you may have thousands of data you could sell, each for 0.5 cents. These could be recurring forms of data. 21's product provides the framework for the microtransactions to happen unconsciously. Somebody who wants all this data doesn't have to actually go to to a web page, add to cart, checkout, etc. They can type an instruction on the command line. It doesn't even have to be a person - could be part of a larger automated process. Their device can instantly pay thousands of people the equivalent of 0.5 cents, using bitcoin that was passively mined, or earned previously, selling some other digital asset.

Damn, a lot of cynics and pessimists here.
Let me just point out that there are some really, really, REALLY smart folks with incredible track records involved with this company. Those people have likely been spending over a hundred hours a week for the last year thinking about the future of bitcoin and how to target a very early stage product to developers that can push this whole bitcoin idea forward.
Meanwhile the commenters dumping on this product probably haven't thought about it for more than 5 minutes.

Incorrect. The winner is selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the same body that gives out the Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry. It is true that the Swedish national bank made the initial donation to support the economics prize some 50 yrs, but otherwise it has nothing to do with them. 
In any case, a wise man once said that the economics prize is given out by a committee of highly esteemed Swedes, while the other prizes are given out by, umm, committees of highly esteemed Swedes.

It takes a lot of knowledge and learning to get and use bitcoin today, but innovation will change all that. Think of the early days of mp3 and how much understanding it took to get your favorite song onto some crappy mp3 player. A few years later and now my Mom can download her favorite song on her iPhone without thinking about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:52:21
Hmmm? Don't understand. How do you know the value of a bitcoin? OP thinks $800 is too much - but that's just an arbitrary number - bitcoins are divisible by a factor of 1e8.
Bitcoin also doesn't need a high volume of retail transactions to flourish - it can function as a store of value not unlike gold. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:31:54
It's a bad article. He's basically making the case that bitcoin will never become the world's dominant currency. But even if it just captured a few percent of transactions, or was just used as a store of value amounting to small percentage of world gold reserves, you're talking about each bitcoin being worth at least $50k+.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:01:51
"Bitcoin is anonymous and can't be traced."
It's not really anonymous. And it's also the most traceable form of payment maybe ever created. Every simgle
transaction in bitcoin history is recorded in the blockchain.

Well, I get frustrated when I use Android apps. I like the uniformity of iOS apps. They all have a familiar design, with a shared icon set, consistent location of buttons and menus. When I get a new iOS app I already know how to use it and my productivity is higher. Infinite customization is not always good.
Linux also lets you do what you want, when you want, and how you want. But sometimes you need to abstract away all that customization and have some choices made for you, and so I'd rather use Mac OS or Windows on a daily basis.
Anyway, totally off-topic, but I agree that it sucks Apple is pulling Bitcoin apps. But I get peeved when people think iOS users are only concerned about status.

He doesn't understand that mining serves the purpose of securing the system, making it harder / more expensive for attackers to gather the resources needed to compromise the system.

Because all the gold in the world stores $9T worth of value. If Bitcoin captured just 5% of that, each Bitcoin would be worth about $40,000.
