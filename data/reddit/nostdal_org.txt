You're wrong; there might not be that many pizzas left. Same goes for BTC (1 coin). Nothing's fixed here; that's a laughable idea; it's all relative (in many directions at the same time), always changing over time and even subjective.

There is a reason why I used quotes around the word corrupt. Things really would be quite different if corruption and waste was visible through the price system. I.e. "corruption" would be, well, legal, but it wouldn't make sense economically to do it because you'd lose customers.

Yes, or it might not – or the price of the pizza can also change over time. Also a purchase decision is made at a single point in time based on the current prices anyway.
Don't forget that the USD also changes in value over time – even though it is a reserve currency.
..anyway, perhaps all this does not matter here..




That's fine; colored coins and similar apply here and all, but it's still silly to say that "Bitcoin is not scarce". It's just poor use of language and even wrong when used with "because it is divisible". Think of it in a different way; if I could mine as much Bitcoin as I wanted whenever I felt like why would they have any value at all and why would I then mine them in the first place? Bitcoin is scarce because it must be scarce.

@_date: 2015-06-15 00:36:09


Back to the original example we assume a snapshot in time where 1 BTC would buy 1 pizza. The hungry people of the world would not be happy if we split this 1 BTC up into pieces (divisible) and told them to buy pizza with the dust (value) they'd get.
Mixing divisibility (tokens) and scarcity (related to value; economic) is pretty stupid and ruins communication and language.
@_date: 2015-06-14 13:19:13
So how much does a pizza cost in BTC these days?
Just think weight (the piece you get) correlated with value. Of course it's stupid.

Yes, Bitcoin is strongly neutral; like digital cash. This is one of several reasons why it has *any value at all*.
Bitcoin can be used by both good and good actors *equally*. 
In a different world where everything was controlled by a single central entity the problem is that bad actors and ideas are naturally pulled towards these power hubs. It's just too tempting. Consider for a moment one group of people with centralized power (and/or trust); the priests with their child abuse and child porn ... the relation between power and corruption is here, as in other places, not a random accident ..   ...centralized power means the entities holding it are above what they are supposed to be overseeing; this opens up a world of possibilities for them.
..and what you're stuck with then is something that is not neutral; and over time migrates from, initially perhaps yes, slightly more good than evil to something *completely corrupt and evil*.
In a way it is hard to determine who is good and evil; and the entities often change over time.
So instead we want a decentralized system where this systemic failure (  ) cannot happen – and where law enforcement will have to deal with e.g. child porn in different ways. I.e. they will have to infiltrate these groups under cower; old fashion style.
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:54:41


Bitter much?


Growth doesn't start in the end you seem to be thinking of, but sure; perhaps Bitcoin will turn out to be the worst investment of 2014 after being the best investment by far of 2013.
What's interesting is that if you are right you can actually bet on this (short) and make a _massive_ profit and end up utterly filthy rich. This is how some of the _really_ rich people have made money by the way; they have made bets against what was at one time "the majority" you speak of. Think about that for a moment; you are free to decide; the free market is pretty neat, huh?

edit: basically read what whitslack says below, but in other words it's something like this:
1. if a hacker gains root on your node (pc, server or phone); he owns it 100%   ...gaining root can indeed be tricky or even impossible
2. ..but apple _already has_ root on your phone, but promises that they won't do or aren't doing bad things

The PC sucks with regards to security; Bitcoin is not the only thing with problems in that environment. 
On e.g. Android each app runs as a separate (Linux) user account. The files created by apps (e.g. private keys) are exclusively owned by each user account. I'm sure Android has problems too, but this alone is miles ahead of Windows. 
Also, some of the Bitcoin wallets now has a feature that lets you to write down 12 (or so) randomly generated words on paper for you to store away safely if you where to lose your phone. This will enable you to restore all your keys.

Yes; the rich get richer and the poor get poorer exactly because of _this_. It's crony capitalism.

100k is nothing for a Cypriot (i.e. not Russian) business or any business – which means a ton of them where hit by this outright theft (40% or for Laiki Bank 100%(!) of deposits gone; taken). This in turn affected the "average person" (i.e. not "just" business) in Cyprus.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:41:28
The key point here is that they shouldn't need to be "convinced". They should just be able to use it without thinking – which is their default mode of operation. Anything else than this default non-thinking mode of operation causes *extreme* discomfort for them. If you challenge anything "within" their default mode of operation they will not like you; they are anti-curious, anti-intellectual and hostile to anything "in the way" of their day-to-day, year-after-year autopilot even if it will benefit them.
They will not have any interest in Bitcoin as an investment either; stuff like that is "evil" or at best "suspicions" (no matter what the outcome). Bitcoin will *only* work for these people if it is *easier and faster than credit cards*.

Most people aren't born sick and (would) have plenty of time to make tricky long-term decisions with regards to their health and life if given a proper opportunity. In order for them to do this, they of course need to see what reality costs or might cost to begin with ...
Basically I value the free market _exactly because_ I know that I'm screwed unless I can afford to take care of myself when something goes wrong and govt lets me down. 
Also people make "free market decisions" with regards to uncertainties and even unknowns every day. How safe do you want your car to be? An old, cheap car can be terrible with regards to safety. What happens if you happen to crash into some expensive car? We have free market options with regards to insurance here; it works! Risk is always real; just because some friendly govt want to hide facts of life from you does not make it go away; you have been exploited and made a fool of!

No, I'm arguing against your general point that monopolies tend to form _and_ stick around "no matter what".
..and the "force and gun" thing is _exactly_ why people will exit or work around it instead of fight it. It will actually drive things and make the changes happen even quicker because these things (violence) are not effective with the way our culture already is and is turning more and more over time where communication is more and more distributed and well connected (graphs instead of trees).
Another future _will not_ be possible; the alternative is another World War because of governments and exactly what you say and this will probably kill us. What I hint at here is the next critical step for any intelligent species; it is also why we have begun (without asking anyone!) to create _and adopt_ a distributed money or currency system like Bitcoin.
..you may laugh at me as they did the ones talking about democracy 1000's of years ago, but notice in yourself how you are talking about why things are the way they are today (as if I did not understand this) and in recent history looking back, and, you're arguing, why they will stay this way – and how I am talking about what will happen. The world has changed _extremely_ in the last few decades; believe me when I say that culture, even globally, is building on, catching up to and waking up to this – and it is culture with what _it_ demands that ultimately (re)defines society.

You seem to assume that this would "naturally happen", but you'd be quite wrong. Look at Myspace and now FB (about to fall).
People and "their culture" once laughed at the thought of democracy thinking it'd be totally unrealistic ("no king or dictator would agree to such thing; we should just give up!"), but now we have the same thing; we are moving on to what will be the next phase because people and our culture is getting more and more ready for this.
..it will happen; this is why young people do not vote anymore; they have figured it out; some will chose to continue fighting the system, but eventually people will work around it instead and take the exit strategy; just watch.

Nah, I think people need to and want to live – and so they spend some of their Bitcoin once they realize it has risen in value. People also want payment in Bitcoin for the same reason.


I think this is because people expect everything to be paid for via loans instead of agreements of adjustable payments over time; it is ridiculous, and (the expectations) seems to be growing.

Yes, they have the, ahem, "correct" economics education (given them to them by state backed "professors") and are given various prizes from the state for being "good little economists"; basically promoting state and central bank propaganda. The entire thing is a giant ponzi scheme.
Why are they given prizes, enjoying the spot light and fame? Because their way of doing economics (and most importantly forcing it on the little guy) *benefits the state and the central banks* (same thing) – while the by now clueless and/or brainwashed people (most of them...) bear all the cost while chanting their national anthems like zombies.
All of this is no accident; follow the deals, the money, corruption and the unjust profits and fame; it's all there.

@_date: 2014-12-19 22:50:31
OK, this is where things usually derail very quickly because, it seems, people fundamentally seem to disagree on what freedom means while at the same time ignoring systemic risk, but I'll try ..


Yes, but how did one get to be an owner of something; anything at all; small or big. Keep in mind that there are probably many, many people out there who are way poorer than you. Freedom will always mean *some* inequality or the word has no meaning or is corrupted or misused.


If the orders are poor, both the (local) top and the workers lose their jobs and their wealth. This is better than even further centralizing things – as if things then go wrong (we are all humans..) we have an even bigger failure.


This part of society is not "ordered". People are *free* to buy what they want; a capitalist cannot demand ("ordered") you buy their products like e.g. the state demands taxes for an offer you can't refuse. There is an enormous difference here, and this leads on to the systemic risk I mentioned already.


Wealth must be *created*. Indeed some inherit wealth, but this has been shown to almost always last 3 generations at best before it is all lost. Not that it'd matter anyway, because created wealth in one place does not remove the ability for others to create wealth in other places; i.e. economic activity is not a zero sum game – that is to say as you add genuinely active players to the game "the cake" *grows in size*.

Note that you cannot run a bitcoind instance on their server. They will kill the  instance because of bandwidth consumption forcing you to restart it. :(
I suppose adding `maxconnections=10` to ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf would make it OK though, but I don't know for sure; if someone (even just one person out of those 10 connections) with big bandwidth happens to connect to you to download the blockchain you'd still get a big usage spike as this is not "real" bandwidth speed throttling.
They have limits anyway (which is fine) and could do the speed throttling themselves(??) so I don't understand this policy... I got my money back though.

Moving to a "different" place won't matter when there are taxes there too. It is also unreasonable to begin with.


It would be called something else than "taxes". You'd pay someone to guard your house, come when there is a fire, insurance for health etc. – instead of grouping everything together into one big payment called "tax" where 90% goes to bullshit while the rest goes to the shit you actually wanted and needed.
With freedom there is accountability and risk. Without freedom there is none; only corruption.

We are tired of your too big to fail view of the world. We want the rubber to meet the road _as often as possible_ even if that means _some_ volatility and "manipulation". Why?

If you where the mob – in which places would you focus your "protection" racket (in trade for "freedom"; a single vote; laughable) the most? You'd probably focus it where there is a lot of private activity; where there is opportunity for "profit".


No, because moving to a different place is not "comfortable" even if it had all the infrastructure you speak of. I pay private companies for Internet access by the way; you type a lot of nonsense. I travel a lot, and after a few months you tend to start missing your friends and family – and making new ones takes time; that's why it is "uncomfortable".




I'm Norwegian, and I don't like the healthcare system here. I instead have private health insurance; just in case. It does not cost a lot of money compared to taxes (taxes and fees in Norway are insane; 1 beer will cost you 15 USD); which go to a lot of bullshit I do not care for like  which was unofficially (since we don't have a direct democracy) voted as something the Norwegian people did not want, but they built it anyway. This is just one silly example; there are many more. 90% of taxes ends up going to bullshit; people are waking up to this; it is not surprising anymore.

Also, payouts happen with bigger intervals on the p2pool network; you'll get more for each payout, but they happen less often.

It'll (need to) go much, much further than this – and we'll be much, much better off if we get there. 
Wanna know why we have these horrible political and economic shifts and bubbles? Because in a democracy (and in some other political systems and ideas), the effects of individuals with different opinions and wishes cannot cancel each other out.
Democracy is not humble; it is assertive and overly confident based on what some majority thinks. This is *not* a strong or robust system, as when the majority happens to be wrong we all fall.
The "free market of social/political ideas" is much more humble – and systemic failure is replaced by smaller pockets of failure there. *This* is a robust system because it is truly decentralized paying no mind to what the majority happens to be at some point in time. 
A majority still exists of course, but it is constantly changing *naturally* and without resistance or conflict – and must be measured after the fact instead of before the fact. Measuring things after the fact like this is still useful for various reasons. A system like this respects nature and humanity instead of forcing nature and humanity to be something it is not; everything and everyone is different and that's the way it should be because that's the way it really is anyway. 
Democracy is an unnatural, naive, blunt, overly confident and dangerous human invention that has nothing to do with how humanity and nature really works. It stands in the way of individuals; and therefore it stands in the way of all of us.

It might be too much and wasted, but who knows when things aren't transparent at all – what could possibly go wrong? Did you know that doctors in e.g. Norway sometimes refuse medicines for e.g. cancer patients based on cost? These people die – and here we are thinking it's all "sort of for free". What a joke; you see it's not like the problem of cost and price goes away just because we _remove the labels_ and _pretend_ everything's "sort of free" when it's actually not at all.
A doctor has to eat – and a research team has to eat too.

..sometimes it is not the most local central-planners who push things out of balance. And of course any market (more free or not) will react violently to various "economic protection" laws and central-planning schemes being both added and/or (then) removed.
Just look at how Venezuela runs out of toilet paper (central-planning is just *that* good!) – or how stores in Russia are now empty because of idiotic sanctions (leading to both problems and imbalances with supply / demand, export / import and currencies) that will *of course* eventually hurt the most vulnerable masses both there and here (EU) big time. No free market will alone cause this; it only reacts.
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:04:30
Whales playing with walls etc. is not "manipulation" and it is perfectly OK in all ways.
When some people cry "manipulation!", it is because they've ended up on the wrong end of a trend or trade. What they really mean is "this is unfair; I don't feel so good about what's happening to me!".
Of course, no one forced them to buy (or sell) Bitcoin to begin with; they alone _opened themselves up_ for what is now happening to them – and so perhaps these people should switch from markets and trading to politics or religion and leave the rest of us alone?
Also I don't think e.g. MtGox did "manipulation"; what I mean is that that's not the right word. Yes, even if they had a bot that bought and did *whatever* in order to trigger some sort of response in traders; that'd be perfectly fine as I see it (after all; the users can use bots too!) as long as they had stayed solvent and true with regards to their own and customer accounts and the data presented.

The group needs to be big enough, and the switch needs to be swift or they might lose more than they gain by switching. So in a way things might still be seen as "_potentially_ decentralized" – so some accountability is maintained.
...I can't make up my mind about this 50% issue; just some thoughts.

Yeah, and what's good for the state is clearly also good for the people... Bitcoin business' are leaving New York in droves; such growth; such entrepreneurship; such profits; such new jobs .....this sure is a "respectable" result ..

Agreed, but IMHO exactly this makes society _not_ civilized. In the same way a wife beaten daily, but not breaking up (e.g. in order to "not cause any more trouble") is not civilized.
I think the Stockholm syndrome applies to a lot of the masses. Also people who have trouble with anarchy (e.g. anarcho-capitalism) think it "would lead to chaos!", but this is already chaos.

This is correct; they have an unlimited amount of money (fiat), but they will need to purchase Bitcoin somewhere to pay the fees and Bitcoin is not unlimited.

Well, libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism hasn't killed at least 20 million (some estimate up to 70 million) people for one, because it doesn't have the same *systemic risk* potential as e.g. communism (and similar) at all. It is a very modest proposal where one admit that there will always be problems that cannot be *instantly solved* by resorting to various extreme utopian top-down solutions without the risk of creating much bigger problems. It tries to not ignore these things ..
..anyway, I'm not in the mood to talk about this any further at the moment; I almost always find it an utterly disappointing and depressing topic. It is much better to stay away from other people and their "ideas"; I do not even vote.
Just a handful videos about various parts of society that could be run in a decentralized fashion with very little "imagination" required; if Bitcoin succeeds it too is an example of the same decentralization of power ancaps and libertarians talk about:

Some people don't like problems and try to remove them or work around them. Other people don't like to see or hear that the problems exist at all – pretending instead that they do not exist even though they do and so the problems get to grow.
The issue is never some majority vs. a minority; the issue is (or should be..) morality. At one point your country had "mind your business" written on your coins; there where good reasons for this, but it got forgotten on the way and now you're stuck here writing frustrated, empty rants on Reddit resenting it.

I wonder  .....if this _actually was_ the mob – and they had e.g. the same costumes, guns and important looking papers, would you be able to tell the difference?
I hear this way of thinking works wonders in North Korea too; very healthy; everything is under control. Neighbors will report you for any "suspicious activity" that might "burden The Community".

$600 might have seemed like a good deal at half price from $1200 top. $300 might have seemed like a good deal at half price again. Now $150 might seem like a good deal at half price yet again.
Then again and longer term looking at 2011 we rose to $30 then fell to $2 or something – before slowly recovering. That too was many "omg, half price!" moments; 30, 15, 7.5, 3.75. Perhaps all this is what's happening right now again? It's impossible to know for sure.

* Boot tails on your laptop: 
* Start Electrum.
* Create new wallet and write down the 12 words (your "seed") on paper.
* Store multiple copies of these 12 words in safe locations, and don't ever type them in anywhere else besides in the Electrum wallet running from your booted tails CD and only there.
..that's it. For daily use store smaller amounts on your phone.  is good, "true P2P" and has been around forever. If you're an iPhone user I hear good things about Breadwallet.
edit: I would not bother with the simple paper wallets as it is very easy to make a mistake and lose your coin. E.g. if you don't fully understand how things like change addresses work you shouldn't do it – and HD seeds stored on paper (what Electrum does) is way more convenient and flexible anyway.

I feel the only thing missing from e.g. the Android "Bitcoin Wallet" app is an ability for the user to see the seed (a couple of random words) so he can write it down on paper.
This is much better than a backup to a password protected file – which in my opinion shouldn't even be an option because most users will pick shitty passwords.
I don't know if Mycelium already supports this? I think Breadwallet (on iPhone) supports this.

* Download and boot tails.
* Start Electrum (no need to connect to the Internet) and create a new wallet.
* Write down the 12 words ("seed") on paper which will be your wallet backup.
* Transfer coin to one of the listed receive addresses.
* I suggest you do a small transfer first then reboot into tails again and enter the same 12 words ("restore wallet from seed") and confirm that you got the transfer before doing the rest.

Whether they are only a little bad, somewhat bad or very bad in various ways and/or degrees.    ...which is why I love private currency or money like Bitcoin – as there is _no chance at all_ they can change things for the worse here; no way to adjust the inflation and start taxing the people in order to fund insane projects like the NSA or foreign wars etc..
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:07:03
Most bitcoin wallets enable you to change what the default suffix is. I.e. you can change the default suffix from BTC to mBTC so you'll just be typing 1 and that's it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:35:52

Here on Reddit we know or at least assume that &lt;username&gt; is the only one in control of his or her account.

I hate to associate with or "belong to" named groups, but I share the same concerns as FSF does with regards to this here. How the heck can I use Bitcoin securely if the hardware has a back-door? How the heck can I do telecommute work with this? ..etc.. there's many examples..
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:27:32


No, we (the market) decide this in the same way also. "How many potatoes does $10 buy?". All _money_ is just communication, and BTC is better at it – and therefore has more "value" as a form of money than other money.
..perhaps this is why this is so hard; we're talking about different kinds of values – I'm also not a native English speaker / reader so I might misunderstand something.
BTC is a bit more complex because people tend to peg it to their old currencies at the moment; it needs to go (be used) full circle and then the true value (the other kind – or perhaps both kinds) of 1 BTC will be known.

I don't agree with this at all; it distorts reality and prices with terrible long-term and growing consequences.
A dumb-ass buying in at $266 and selling at $50 should pay for his mistake. Simplified example; but with real-world resources it has more real-world consequences if it didn't have consequences.

@_date: 2013-11-11 03:11:28
..well, of course. Many wallets can export the private keys directly.
..but again be sure you know what you're doing – both now and later when importing for use. E.g., if you import private keys into a new wallet and take a backup of that wallet not all backup methods include the imported private keys. This can lead to some nasty surprises..
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:50:01

I think the chance of this happening is pretty slim.

* Send the encrypted wallet to your family.
* Write a will. Include the password; write that it is for "your computer" or something like that so tax authority doesn't get their hands on it. Let your family know what you mean by "the computer".

Though, what makes the Reddit bot unique is that the tip can be sent to people who don't yet know about Bitcoin.

A "gold standard" was (and is) worthless when they didn't have the gold they said they had. With BTC this is impossible, as the account (BTC key pair) holding the amount ("promise") is also the actual "gold" itself at the same time.

Just watch less mainstream media. You'll then see the exact same people who predicted the 2008 crash talking about what's coming. It's obvious, but people (i.e. mainstream) don't like bad news. This is why democracy is a joke also btw.. It is all based on hiding and/or denial of inconvenient truths until the bubbles burst and "truth" is there; by that time bigger and thus more destructive than ever...
Also check out the ideas around antifragility. Youtube that shit and more. Do some research. You'll understand that top down regulation and "stability" actually leads to more fragility and bigger and bigger crashes. ....but you people never learn; I can kick and scream all day until I have no more energy left and I'm left in utter despair, exhaustion and depression – so "whatever"...

..because there are different (amounts of) people looking to trade their BTC for USD or their USD for BTC at each place (exchange). This is called supply and demand, and as the demand on one exchange rises (e.g. people looking to buy; exchange USD for BTC) and supply (e.g. sellers; BTC for USD) cannot keep up – the price on that particular exchange goes up.
* 
* 
Depending on what side you're on and what side you want to move to (i.e. you want to move from USD to BTC or the other way around) – what's counted or denoted as supply and demand switches places from your particular point of view or perspective.
It's actually possible to make money on moving value or resources from one exchange to the other; this is called arbitrage:  and is what (eventually) evens out the price differences between the various exchanges.

I think the US realizes that they can't effectively ban it either; it is global. They'll just end up with a bigger problem.
The world is headed in this general direction whether they, you or anyone like it or not. More people have mobile phones than bank accounts. It might not be Bitcoin, but it will certainly be some sort of cryptocurrency "Bitcoin v2.0". 
The grey or black market is _huge_ (do some research) and it is growing and covering more and more goods, things and services than just guns, drugs and prostitution – exactly because the government + "private" banks are fucking things up. 
Good intentions and fancy words and speeches are worthless; people know this now; it's not enough. People understand trust and risk better and better too. Ideologies (intentions), states (trust+risk) and state backed currencies are dying. Everything is more distributed and nuanced now; talk with younger people (I'm already too old; 33) – they seem passive (don'ẗ vote etc.) and hard to control, but they know why and what's really going on.

I'm feeling the structural violence... or something.
The intent (one of them) behind Bitcoin is to get rid of democracy and similar types of centralized power.
If Bitcoin succeeds, democracy as we (mostly) know it with its centralization of power will fall. I.e., politicians will have to _ask nicely_ for other peoples hard earned money for the services they provide – as the rest of us have to do already.
Their services might not even be in very high demand at all...

@_date: 2013-05-07 18:33:12
Well, you're saying they decide what can be used as money and what may not be used as money. They do not decide the _value_ of some amount of money.
..of course a ban on some form of money would (perhaps) render it without value (utility). 
Bitcoin can _still_ be _used_ if banned though – since it is decentralized and anonymous (can be) and not controlled or banned, in effect, by some central authority because there is no central authority or even country; it's global.

This pretty much _completely_ skips the middle men, but you need to completely understand how to deal with all this and how to deal with the risks.

No one is going to try to double-spend while paying for their coffee. So you as the seller do not even wait the 5 seconds before you give him his coffee. 
The network is *very* fast. Transactions I've done using  on both sides are pretty much instant. This is a "real" P2P client.

It's a circle; a spiral; it's fascism and it won't last. Countries will keep printing and lending out "free" money to compete with each other in a totally corrupted and twisted version of capitalism and they will fail like every other state backed currency has – ever.

Closer to the top it says "If you are new to Bitcoin, these wallets are a good place to begin." and it points users to bitcoin-qt, but I don't think bitcoin-qt is a good thing for people to "get started fast and easy" (as the title says) with Bitcoin....
I think both bitcoin-qt and Armory (because it too downloads the entire blockchain) should be labelled as "advanced" wallets or something – and wallets like Electrum and Multibit should be pushed further up or in the face of the (new) users.

"Safer" == not everyone in the network doing the same or using the same kind of node.
I.e., even if it _really was_ somehow determined to be "safer" or "better" or whatever at one point in time – everyone permanently switching over to it would lead to a total negative with regards to "safety", "better", "quality" or whatever for the future.
This is how all software works; Bitcoin just amplifies it via its network. In a sense; Bitcoin as an idea competes with itself – and competition is good with regards to progress and quality.

..of course, but sometimes people sell their coins at a loss – which is what the topic here is about (I guess). I do not then see how putting more money into a loss like that would help...
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:54:09
I don't understand how this matters. Apps. still need to _ask_ for root access, and if some e.g. Bitcoin ticker widget/app asks for root access something's off.

Many use the same DDOS protection services; they suck, and/or I don't trust them...
..but! Lag happens not _before_ a crash. When you see the Mt. Gox lag value rising, what is displayed is what's know about the _past_. This triggers further sells and so on and so on.

Oligarchy? No, it's even more general; people don't care what the majority (even among themselves!) thinks anymore. People today want to be able to make _individual choices_ in real time even if these choices are in "conflict" (bullshit!) with some majority.

Oh, but I can. I got some of mine on my phone; I can hold that. I got some more on an encrypted USB stick in my back-pack.

@_date: 2013-04-11 13:06:28
I don't think so, but you can force it to connect to a specific node (you trust) – as a priority.
..e.g., I have 100% control of a Linux server with the full bitcoind software running on it – so I connect to the IP of that server.
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:51:01


..might be tricky, but perhaps a more direct approach (they seem to like that – and I like that too!) might work here too:

Also see Electrum; it's _very_ good IMHO.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:06:22
More servers "in the cloud" doesn't magically fix problems with software. The software (or parts of it) might assume that everything's running within one process – or on one node (server); for instance. There's no magical solution to any of this – and even if you make things scale to 2 nodes – this doesn't mean it'll magically scale (well) to 3 nodes and so on.

They can follow "it" with 100% accuracy actually. Too bad then that each person or entity (i.e. computer program) holding a Bitcoin "account" can create 1000's of new accounts _in seconds_...
I.e. they will have to deal with perhaps not randomness and anonymity, but chaos and pseudo-anonymity which makes all that 100% precision data completely worthless.

"..anything _we_ don't understand is dangerous and probably needs to be regulated or even illegal."
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:56:33
Yes, in particular nr. 3. 
I mean if you have problems handling the load – which is totally OK, but takes time to fix – don't simply let more traders or trades like these in! Throttle that stuff. Limit the number of orders / cancels pr. second, hour or even total amount of outstanding orders pr. account. Something like that; I don't know. Set a lower floor on the amount; seeing 1000's of 0.001 and even 0 (???) orders flow in hour after hour on end and lag rise once they start to execute _all at once_ is starting to get old; it's not surprising anymore.
edit: oh, and "making the servers faster" doesn't solve the problem; as this makes adding these orders also faster!
Let the free market do its thing indeed, but not via lag based manipulation ­– and then work longer term on improving your platform to support more of this crazy stuff later. Think long term! This is hurting both Bitcoin and MtGox.

That's strange as this happens here. I'm using Cyanogenmod – perhaps it is unique to this mod? Again, if an app needs root access for something at any point in time – I get a popup request asking me to grant it this right first.

@_date: 2013-04-14 12:30:55
I think much of the (initial) lag is caused by orders added before there is any lag at all. Hour by hour, orders are added that later on execute all at once.

If you want better roads but don't want to pay for this yourself then you don't want better roads. Actually, since you are OK with taxes you are already paying for better roads (well, a _very_ small portion of your taxes goes to this...) – but you are also paying for other things (e.g. NSA) you are not OK with. That is not democracy – or wait; that's exactly what it is and why it sucks.
..or, companies (food etc.) in your area can go together and pay for better roads to/from the area ­– as doing so would benefit them with regards to transportation costs. Then you would be paying for better roads via slightly higher food costs for a while.
I don't usually answer sarcasm, or I was planning on saying something like "well, that's just your opinion, man...", but whatever, man...

With the dollar the ones creating (printing) them can also (in addition to the people) control or shift (to their own benefit) their value though – by e.g. printing more. With Bitcoin this is not possible because if more people start mining, mining difficulty rises to compensate.

Why? 
You pull out your Bitcoin Android client and it instantly connects to a set of peers on the global Bitcoin network. It's a truly decentralized client. Then, someone sends you payment – and you wait about 1.5 seconds and you hear a "cash'ing!" sound from your phone and the money is there.
Sure, it's "unconfirmed" – but how does this matter for small or even medium'ish amounts? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:56:02

Good! There is nothing wrong with having a lot of money if it was earned via free trade. If this means some "candidate" (i.e. asshole) can advertise himself more and better then so be it! This does not mean that I will vote for him (again: with _my_ money) – that is to say I do not support or even like democracy and "voting" with anything but money!

Are you a fucking asshole _and_ a dumbass? These things might have "Bitcoin" printed on them; some paper wallets even "look like" money – because, you know; that's what they are.
I agree they'd probably just have taken the things by then though, but why take any chance. That's not a question by the way. You go ahead and do whatever you like or think is best for you though; it's not my problem (or mindset). Anyway the things _probably_ have their private keys hidden – as I already said, but who knows.

Printing money turned out to be useful for one thing and one thing only; hidden taxation of all regardless of their opinion of the state – in context of e.g. war. Of course he's popular, and of course he's right in the eyes of the state.

It and what you do with it is backed by crypto instead of empty promises from other people or governments. This has huge value IMHO.
Trust is worthless and fake if it is requested when not actually needed to begin with.     ...I can't seem to find a good way to express what I mean by this...    but yeah; it's Open Source Software and again backed by crypto and math; I trust that 2 + 2 = 4 no matter what you or they promise or how many guns and bombs your or they bring.

We have labels for many feelings (sad, happy, etc.), but for sex related feelings the labels seem somewhat static for some reason.  ...I guess my overall label is "I'm OK with whatever makes me and the other person happy" – and with that my "current label" _in the eyes of other people_ changes. I don't know; I'm not very interested in this stuff tbh...
FWIW I've never been with or been interested in cis males before, but perhaps that will change in the future; who knows? I mean I've never been able to control (feelings) what e.g. cis females I like (even the ones that are bad for me!) or do not like, either...

I'm pretty much the same – I spend my time:
* Programming (in order to make more Bitcoin!).
* Reading this sub.
* Watching YouTube videos about Bitcoin and the economy in general.
...I don't care about most other subjects anymore – as they do not affect me (or my working life) and seem silly. I'm pretty much all in on Bitcoin these days – and I've cut all my fiat type expenses to the bone trying to go more and more over to Bitcoin full circle.

It will never become the official currency of _anywhere_ IMHO. There's no way; tax via inflation is just too good (for them).

As he concludes at the end; everything needs to be decentralized from the ground up for all this to work in the long run. 
I think something sucky and centralized provided on top of the very decentralized Bitcoin system like e.g. PayPal will be a good thing though; it'll buy us some time – kind of like how Napster evolved into Bittorrent (with Magnet links) since both where built on TCP/IP or the Internet anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:55:56

The problem with 3G (3G+) and 4G is that it's worthless after about 10 minutes of use - as that's the amount of time it takes to hit the data cap. 
Especially 4G is totally idiotic or just pathetic - as the cap moving from 3G to 4G has pretty much stayed the same everywhere. 4G/LTE isn't fooling anyone; not for long.
edit: Just install a data measurement thingy on your computer or phone and take a look. Watch a few YouTube videos all in glorious HD which they say "4G/LTE is made for!" and you'll easily break, say, 15GB (my cap when I'm in Norway) in 2-3 days - and that precious 4G phone or stick is now _completely useless_ for the next 28 days. Yay!

If you _really need_ to buy something you'll buy something – you know; as you do with fiat (right??  ), but better.
I mean; if you instead held fiat – this would _cause you_ to buy crap you don't need? That's just silly.

5 years? Where do you buy your lightbulbs – and at what price? Mine lasts 2 months...

"Change" is not possible. The end game is we ignore them and work things out ourselves...

Is authy OSS? It seems to rely on a centralized server? ...meh.
edit: ..and I guess it's only available on "Google Play"?

"_We_ are the educated ones. _We_ (or our heroes) have never thought about or heard about this before – and so it must be silly."
..this seems to happen a lot and with a lot of subjects..

Then what are you doing here? What can your purpose possibly be?
It is pretty clear what the original creator(s) of Bitcoin thinks about the banks and the state. It is even documented in the blockchain and via various forum posts..
If you are happy with the state and the USD why are you here?

..of course as an intellectual priest _you_ have understood all of this; we should trust you on that.

Have a hug...!
..my GF is TG; life is good. Bitcoin has a "no rules" type apolitical (and areligious) potential and I really like that. I feel all this and everything is connected – and it all leads back to _money_. I.e. our old fashioned hierarchical and centrally controlled societies with some "authority" or "democracy" thing at the top (or as the majority) telling others what they can and cannot do _with their own lives_ (and money – which is time, which in turn _is life_) can fuck off.
..sorry for the rant..

For once, there's no "we". That's the beauty of it.

Perhaps we got an EU "haircut" too...   can it really be this crazy?
Probably not, but if this turns out to be the case (one way or the other) then I've lost a significant amount of money on this – which makes me even more certain that the banks need to go away, and Bitcoin is the future.

Does SEPA work from your end?

An _exchange_ is a place for buying BTC. You _exchange_ USD for BTC there.
..but funding your account at exchanges and similar is often not done with PayPal for obvious reasons. See

No one is talking about stopping this permanently – but dealing with it based on the current reality of the Mt.Gox infrastructure.
This is throttled at the "real" exchanges also.
edit: People who know nothing or only a little about software and architecture should stop commenting with regards to this. The posts – some voted to the front page of this sub, are just embarrassing.

Your question ends there ... :)
..it really is _extremely_ unlikely that you'll get a collision. It is however (or exactly therefore) important that you have a very healthy random number generator:

Let's see: 
* ctrl-f "launder" ...nope, no mentions of that at all; certainly not in the introduction
* ctrl-f "shady" ...nope, no mention of that; certainly not in the introduction
..this even though the USD is used way more for these things than Bitcoin.

How about I transfer 100 BTC to you right now then? It'll take seconds and no one will ask any questions. You can buy gold (or whatever) with it if you want to.
..or do you want me to transfer 100 BTC worth of physical gold to you instead? The paperwork and transportation fees are taken from the initial 100 BTC amount. I'm not even sure I could transfer the gold to you without a lot of legal trouble.
I'm not sure what's more of a pain in the ass...
