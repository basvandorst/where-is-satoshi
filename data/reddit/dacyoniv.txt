It originated from Bitcoin and a huge part of the blockchain is the same. I personally think it makes sense but that's just me.

If a "big" coin like btc (lets say ~$6000) drops by $100/1btc it means nothing.
If a "smaller" coin like eth (lets say $300) drops by $100/1eth it is huge.
One dropped 1,6% and the other cone dropped 33%.

Still 200MB of transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:08:43
I'm stating a fact, don't get all personal. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:09:52
I haven't posted anything lately. I just notice other posts. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:52:35
ETH is bad?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:25:09
Don't use it for the thing it is meant to be used for. That would create something scary.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:21:33
I don't see the block height there anywhere though, or do I?
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:06:13
That's not gonna get you friends around here. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:21:09
This does sound stupid to me, but I am willed to be surprised.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:23:03
Hard to do if anything else is deleted. :/
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:48:59
Which other sub?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:37:57
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:30:02
Exactly what I did, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:51:11
Make that two pieces of paper then!
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:10:57
That means I'd be right, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:34:47
That's the math I mentioned but thanks anyway. :p
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:11:54
I'd really like a mathematical equation rather than a countdown. :/

Begging for donations is the way to go champ!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:53:32
State that "more info" here.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:07:44
How so? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:13:40
So not using the coin for what it was intended to do (because it also is no longer possible) makes it more appealing?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:13:30
Nice TA there!
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:44:55
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:06:47
Ah, the good ol' cup-and-handle pattern!

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:09:14
If you get stuff 10% cheaper, why not? The current clogging might be the bigger problem.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:56:48
Depending on the fees, you might try that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:20:18
The blocks are too small for this frequency and amount of transactions. I won't talk about manipulation, fud or anything alike - people should make their own minds and not copy another's based of a single comment.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:00:40
Transactions can not be confirmed because the amount of transactions (indirectly) in a block is limited. Since bitcoin is a chain of blocks and you have way more transactions than fit in a block, the number in the above links grows.
The more fees you pay, the higher the "priority" is, because it is more profitable for the miners.
edit: The above explanation might suck, so here a quick rundown:
- bitcoin transaction are "stored" in blocks
- bitcoin blocks are limited to 1MB
- there are 705MB of transactions to be processed at this point of time
- the number of transactions grows
- you have to send higher fees so that the "block creators" (miners) even consider handling your transaction and adding them to the blockchain

Might wanna look at this: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:16:23
Please see percentages instead of absolute numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:28:20
Exodus and Electrum are quite popular.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:48:57
I predict a change when the next difficulty adjustment kicks in.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:51:15
Yeah, that's a common theory.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:06:58
What stops it? The devs.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:39:07
Excellent analysis! Let's draw some more random circles and arrows to predict the next lottery!
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:12:35
Monero? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:38:29
I am curious because my country has a different ruling here; Cryptocurencies can be exchanged for fiat money without paying any taxes if they have been held for more than one year. 
I suppose you guys live in the USA - is your ruling the same as for shares on the stock market?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:48:49
Surely I will trust an artist like you then!
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:22:15
But aren't the fees a massive obstacle?
