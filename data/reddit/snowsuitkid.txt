Yeah uhh I'd have to disagree with you there mate. Assuming the bitcoin network is taking up some exuberant amount of power (which it apparently can), that doesn't come from nowhere. I'm not at all convinced that people who buy bitcoin necessarily aware with the all of the details of the technology (like the caveat that the network eats up a metric fuckload of electricity), and are also equipped to properly assess the market. Additional operators definitely do have a tangible footprint in terms of overall energy consumption, and it's probably in your interest to afford this issue further thought.

I mean unless the electricity is coming from nuclear sources, I kinda give a fuck. Sure there is security, but we shouldn't need a Dyson sphere to power it 30 years from now if we want it to replace traditional systems of money (which is the point right?)

Right but smart contracts are Ethereum's domain, aren't they?

Right so it works as a bit of a positive feedback loop (assuming the value is solely tied to how distributed the ledger is), although I do feel like there would be serious diminishing returns after a while. Like, there's no point in distributing the ledger to infinite machines because we have only so many people, etc... Do we have data on the difference on power consumption between high and low markets? Also what is our ideal size for the network? I know its not a simple question, but I feel like the answer is somewhere between 2 and infinity.
Also I've seen all that info on nuclear power before and I see a larger picture. However, that's a different discussion for a different subreddit :P

Sorry I'm just a scrub m8

Ummm yeah you aren't explaining your reasoning sufficiently. The miners running the network create a massive demand of electricity (comparable to that of a first-world nation), and that is undeniable. People aren't running their GPUs at the point of power generation so there would be a transmission loss (however negligible, thanks to transformers) anyway. Also people did panic over the invention of lightbulbs with regard to their power consumption. That's why we don't light everything with incandescent lightbulbs anymore.
It's obviously stupid to blame climate change on a single activity, but methane has a significantly stronger greenhouse effect than CO2, and cows account for &gt;15% of the world's methane production so that would suggest that they have some part of global warming.
But yeah I'm pretty sure mining bitcoins doesn't reduce overall energy consumption

Ahh okay cool thanks! You've been very helpful kind stranger :)
