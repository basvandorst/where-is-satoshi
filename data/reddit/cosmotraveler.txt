Forgive me if this is an overly noob-ish question:
With regards to capital gains tax, lets say you invest $1000 into Bitcoin, and in a couple years its worth $10k. Now lets say, rather than selling it and cashing out for fiat currency you unload it by purchasing something with it, say a $10k car, from a seller who accepts Bitcoin. Would you still have to somehow pay capital gains even though you never sold your Btc for fiat?

Ok, Yeah I was wondering how small purchases would work...like how a barista would ring up a cup of coffee and say "ok, that'll be 0.000175 bitcoin". So the adjustment of units/terminology makes sense for integrating small fractions of bitcoin into day to day transactions. Thank you

Ok I think this makes sense. Once it becomes less about investing, and I guess once crypto is more incorporated into the marketplace, there will be more incentive to circulate it rather than simple buy/sell/hold like an asset?

Ok thank you that makes sense. Would I be taxed upon purchasing the car, or only later if I sold the car back for USD?

I bought a fraction of a bitcoin for the first time a few weeks ago and while Im happy to hodl and watch my investment grow, Im also totally on board with the idea of crypto becoming the currency of the future, the more I learn about it. 
What has me confused is, as bitcoins value goes way up relative to fiat, doesnt that make it increasingly difficult for new people to adopt, since their money only buys them smaller and smaller quantities of Bitcoin? So if thats the case, how can we expect it to have a more widespread adoption?
If this is a total noob question thats because Im a total noob.

Im just now getting on the bitcoin train and my bank deposit just cleared into Coinbase after a long week. I know its hard to predict but would you advise I wait for a dip to dump my little chunk of cash or say fuck it and buy in at this momentous $10k mark?
