I have probably spent far too long looking at diagrams like this but my opinion differs slightly from these projections. I cant see a future BTC going through 80-90% retracements as user base and adoption picks up. Each cycle increases the number of long term hodlers and the confidence that BTC wont collapse or disappear. Also more people trying to profit by selling the tops and buying the bottoms limiting the size of the swings.
The future that I think is more likely is that volatility will decrease and the cycles will become faster and smaller. Logically this probably has to happen if BTC is going to be adopted as a global medium of exchange and/or store of value.
To put it in scientific terms the amplitude of price variations will decrease and the frequency increase.

Also possible to make gold on earth by using enough energy, not cost effective, and potentially radioactive.
If the cost of getting 1 ounce of gold to earth from an asteroid is $10,000 there will be no increase in the gold supply of earth from that asteroid until the price goes and stays over that threshold.
The last 100+ years has had a pretty steady increase of the total tonnes mined every year, from 500 tonnes yearly in 1900 to 2500+ now. In that sense it is the opposite of Bitcoins controlled supply.

Gold is just shifting the value of a currency to something else that also is not a fixed point (contrary to what some think). Gold also fluctuates in price (sometimes dramatically) and is just another anchor point for a currency when the anchor is not really needed (hence why the gold standard was kind of pointless). All it ever really ensures is that the currency will have "some value" since gold will always have some value to a certain subset of people. Anything CAN have value and it is just about DOES it have value currently. No "anchor" will ever prevent a currency from suffering a crash.
