If this is real, this guy wins the aware for most tech savvy hobo but wins the Darwin award for only appealing to a very niche section of the population XD

It's a sign of the times! All of us that can see through the FYD will be rewarded in the end as big players become more confident in the industry and start investing. HODL guys! :D

Bitcoin truly is king!

This nearly needs an hour long explainer video to actually wrap your head around it lol

You need to teach people how to peel their eyeballs off the coinmarketcap website ;')

That's actually how I bought my first ever BTC back in 2016! Those ATMs are a really effective bridge between the crypto space and the general public. We need one on every corner :D

I prayed there would be a pullback before my fiat cleared and here it is :') stock up people!

Tragic for Zimbabwe, but I actually think that looks aesthetically pleasing... I wouldn't mind money wallpaper :D

That's when BTC goes to 100K for the first time

I think we all knew manipulation was at play in the Bitcoin market, but regardless remember superior technology will always win in the long-term

That bull nearly blasted off XD
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:09:06
Wow someone's feeling pessimistic :D
@_date: 2018-06-17 23:04:03
Bitcoin was the seed that led to the whole crypto garden in its current form, and yes all launched with almost no budget. Incredible :D
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:05:21
Wow nice wheels dude ;)

Bitcoin in itself MIGHT not be the answer to a cashless society, but blockchain technology in some form(s) sure is!
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:32:04
Inside the upper lip :D
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:55:12
So true! Every system has its own way of exploiting to function

I've been putting in all my spare fiat since late last year, and though the price is important, what's MORE IMPORTANT is the fact that every day the crypto industry as a whole is getting more developed and adopted- and daddy BTC gets more exposure. The future is bright :D

Lol yes, I could definitely see my bf wearing this to work. One for the birthday list!
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:54:13
Binance's progress in such a short time is an indicator of the crypto industry itself- SO MUCH POTENTIAL!

We must have different fashion sense :)
