1. Predictable evidence is based off of need. There is no true store of value yet Bitcoin, being backed only by the minor infrastructure that supports it, is not a safe and predictable store of value. The USD and the Euro are both safe stores of value, although in reality no *currency* is ever going to truly be a store of value.
2. That doesn't give it intrinsic value, that gives it mild trade value. And when small whales still dominate the market, it's not actually worth $260. It could be worth $150 in a matter of days or jump up to $270 for 10 minutes.
I do trust my government not to raid my bank account during a crisis, I also trust that there won't be one. If the USD goes through a crisis, I'm not sure that Bitcoin is a better option, still (and the USD is strong).
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:53:18
So when Peter Todd pushes for a hard fork that doesn't limit the supply to ~21M, you'll change your tune right?
The core devs are your government, your large mining groups are your big corporations, and you once again are left at the mercy of anyone but yourself. Bitcoin isn't limited by anything, the mathematics can be altered, they can be ignored -- nothing about Bitcoin screams stability to me, even if the original core software was well theorized.
The dollar is backed by a militarily and economically powerful mass of 300 million people as well as billions of people around the world who use it for international trade. If the USD collapsed *there would be no Bitcoin*.
There's nothing wild about our printing of money, I only assume you have this point of view because the amounts are inconceivable to you (as they are to me). Our national debt is staggering, but still some of the best stores of value in the world. We make our payments, with interest.
If you're betting on the collapse of the USD I have bad news for you, you're fucked no matter what you do. Bitcoin will not save you, gold will not save you, diversifying will only mean that you'll get fucked by from different ends.
If Bitcoin gives you confidence through the feelings of impending financial doom, I support you -- but reality will be far harsher.
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:44:13
1. Sure there are. There's no guaranteed store of value, but plenty of things are predictably safe. Bitcoin is not of them.

I'm not ideologically stuck on inflation, I'm confident though that money works best as a *transfer of value,* not an attempt at a *store.* Bitcoin is ineffective as a currency because of this.


That's just an assumption -- open source =/= less susceptible. Have you agreed with every fork? What happens when you do disagree? Are you just going to use 'old' bitcoin? Very few people in unelected seats hold the keys to Bitcoin.


I don't hate corporations, I do dislike centralization. Nothing about the current ecosystem tells me Bitcoin is decentralized. There are core developers, there are large mining organizations who control the forks, process transactions at their leisure and reap the rewards.


I guess we'll just disagree that six years is either enough or that it has been successful. 


See the thing is, you ignore the part where billions of people and businesses rely on the USD to transact, build infrastructure, keep the lights on, keep the Internet as decentralized as possible and keep billions of people up and running.
If the USD collapsed nearly everything else would collapse. You think there would be just freely available high speed Internet? Sorry, no Bitcoin.


Yet we have only seen mild inflation on day to day transactions considering most of that money has gone into the bond market.


Society doesn't know best, you're right. Strong argument, but terrible conclusion with Bitcoin.

A state marriage means state benefits.  You can *already* have a decentralized wedding/marriage, it just won't be recognized by the state.  No amount of decentralization will give you state benefits to a non-state marriage.
People get married on a daily basis without the state's involvement.  It only becomes a state marriage when you sign state specific documents to receive state specific benefits.

You're obsessed with legitimacy and legitimacy is not the issue. No one gives a shit about legitimacy.

The reason for lack of universal or any relevant type of adoption has absolutely nothing to do with whether it's legitimate. It's as legitimate as any other transfer piece of value. A fucking beanie baby was a legitimate source of value in the late 90s.

This hate of the fractional reserve has gone too far. Fractional reserve banks are insured by the FDIC. They are fractional reserve because they spend the money on investments. These re-investments go to delivering mortgages, small business loans, credit lines, and other major investments into things that while make a few people a lot of money, most people with jobs.
There is of course excess and greed that also play into it that make this system less fair, that's why we created regulations and stringent ones at that.
Fractional reserve is bad for Bitcoin companies because they are not insured.

While I agree that in terms of Bitcoin history this is not a unique or surprising event.  However, this is an unprecedented amount (in convertible currency) in one of the leading exchanges.
Bitcoin has also more reach and assumed stability across the world than ever before.  This is a time in which Bitcoin has been gaining positive leaps.  We have bitcoin ATMs in Seattle and can buy more and more things with the currency.
Now you're expecting this currency to really stretch it's legs and actually be used for commerce.  These kind of things need to not happen.  It's an unregulated, decentralized maze of confusion, ignorance and doubt.

Let's say we have 10 people. They all agree to be each other's accountants and purchases can only be made when they are all together.
So one of the people decides to buy an apple. 9 of the other people agree that he has purchased that apple, so they accept that that transaction went through.
Now if you somehow got 6 of those people to say, no, he didn't buy the apple, then the transaction would cease to exist... even though initially they agreed that it happened.
With the controlling majority of people, you can say anything happened. You can say the world turned to diamonds and bled butter.

Bitcoin is a beta product.  It's intended goal was to solve problems that we were already aware of.  Unfortunately it created a billion new ones that have yet to be unearthed.

I've never understood the hate for inflation. It's a necessity for money that moves. Money is not meant to be a commodity, it's a form of exchange. Since money has fluidity it can quickly turn from a herd of goats to a luxury sedan.
What we're seeing right now with BTC is it's completely a commodity. That has a lot to do with minimal merchant adoption, but it also has to do with the strategy of holding it and attempting to make money off it just being money. Money as a commodity is bad.
A gold or any other physical linked currency just isn't a reality anymore. Money is too fluid (it's a good thing) nowadays compared to the 1800s and earlier when the value of a dollar was completely meaningless and that being able to exchange for gold (a more universal 'currency') was well represented. We don't need that anymore, USD or EURO is accepted and transferable just about anywhere.  It is gold, it's value derived from the stability of the nation that produces it.
And what does Bitcoin's value derive from? Speculation and only speculation. It's value is still $350 because people have invested real fiat into it so has a flaky consistent value.
That's why it can go to auction and be purchased for much less than it's worth and you couldn't do the same thing with USD or the Euro.

I bought bitcoin to partake, I haven't much opportunity (NewEgg mostly), but like most people, I bought off speculation.
And that's the problem I have, BTC evangelists will tell you why it's awesome in conceptual terms, but pay little attention to how people actually use it.  I *could* pay for this or that with BTC, but I don't have to and like any good business, you need to fill a need.

Bitcoin is already legitimate. It's not stable or guaranteed long term, but it's certainly legitimate.
Being able to buy things that you can buy with a credit card or cash is not a benefit to Bitcoin, it's nice, but it's not going to push adoption.
Doing things you can't do with fiat is what pushes adoption. Microsoft accepting Bitcoin is a big 'hooray' for those of us who use Xbox Live AND hold Bitcoin, but no one is going to buy Bitcoin to buy shit form Microsoft.
I wish companies that were changing how the world works got upvoted instead of just places you can get rid of your Bitcoin (and quickly turned back into fiat). This is great for us, it's a minor benefit for Bitcoin.

I don't think legitimacy is that big of a deal. I think the inconsistency of the price certainly worries people, but in general Bitcoin just doesn't solve a problem for most people.
Bitcoin has the flexibility to solve problems that many of us don't even realize we have and even moreso in developing nations.
Those are what will push adoption, not being able to buy Xbox games.

It's only a matter of time until transactions costs for fiat currencies take a dive if BTC continues to get traction.  Those costs only exist because of a weak infrastructure, over-regulation and a bunch of guys who like to make a ton of money on transactions.

So the likelihood of being attacked successfully is low right noe.  But as computing progresses and our energy sources improve bitcoin has serious issues (along with all institutions).
Bitcoin sounds good right now, but it's only real draw to some should be the attempted decentralization, which is only really a reality right now.

I wish Bitcoin wasn't directly associated with the short-sightedness that is libertarianism.
Just because the decentralization of currency in a modern, connected, stable, organized and successfully governed world doesn't mean that voluntary associations are suddenly going to solve world hunger and war.
It's true that in a 'lawless' situation most people will band together to try and create something... that's why government existed in the first place, it's easier to achieve things as a collective than individually.
The libertarian wet dream is basically socialism without equality.

You are far more bullish on bitcoin than I am.  This isn't a speed-bump, this is a wall.  We can climb over walls, but it's not that damn easy.
What bitcoin needs is consumer confidence.  This does not help confidence when one of the largest exchanges goes down in a mysterious cloud in the amount of hundreds of millions.
This is the downfall of free market.  We have confidence in things like the dollar because it is backed by a relatively stable government.  Bitcoin is backed by perceived value of (in the eyes of the observer) a thin line of stability.
We also don't have a spokesperson for bitcoin to be PR figurehead we need.  
I still trust in bitcoin (and probably will hope for a drop in price to invest more), but this is not a 'speed-bump'.

"Open source" medicine doesn't prevent patents.  Research and delivery of product is fucking expensive, pharmaceutical patents allow for research and development to continue and become beneficial to private corporations.  
If you really want a solution to this, you should support and donate to government backed research which often is NOT patented.
But this is just private, corporate research which is driven by the bottom line.  It's more beneficial to make shorter leaps in treatments because the risk is lower.  Trust me, there is plenty of money in cancer cures as there currently is in treatment.
Basically all University and NPO research is "open source" and plenty of private research is as well.  Maybe not accessible by you and me, but by institutions.  
9-DS is failed cause already because there's no financial benefit for private corporations and it's not a cure, it's says it could be an effective 'treatment'.  We already have treatments.

Well, I don't necessarily agree with that.
It's not necessary to believe in the long term potential of BTC while enjoying short term $$$ potential.   There are plenty of businesses that pop up for short periods of time to take advantage of whatever trend (seasonal, new technologies, etc).
When I purchased at $120 it was mostly off of speculation, It was a sellers market.  People wanted to be a part of BTC.
Then it jumped to $1k and while my balance looked great, it worried me about the long term effects.  Average people don't react well to such enormous fluctuation.  Centralized, paper money is easy to everyone.  They may notice inflation within a decade or 20 years or 'back in my day', but the daily fluctuation is meaningless to them.
The whole Mt. Gox press nightmare was the death blow to me.
The benefits of Bitcoin don't matter if the PR for Bitcoin crumbles.  People remember the very bad, and they hardly notice the good.

There is nothing in place to prevent someone from getting to 51% besides the technical challenges (as proven by Ghash reaching 51%).
Ghash has all the motivation in the world to not destroy Bitcoin, however someone (or a group) wanting to make a quick buck could cash out millions before enough people noticed.
Also, if you control 51% there's no telling what you could do and for how long you could do it.

Why do you think separating them would solve any problem?  All you're doing is removing the basis of value.

Hahahahahahahahaha, Bitcoin has existed for a fucking half second and isn't and never will be a currency.  It's worth less than half it's peak value and hasn't risen for months.  It doesn't solve any problem a normal person has and is so fucking volatile you have to check the price daily to see if you are broke.
It's also worth 50x its value from 24 months ago and any intelligent person would say 'well, fuck, we missed the peak'.

No more wars?  Would love to see proof of that.
The rich have always gotten richer because that's what they do.  They are good at it.  Absolutely the state helps, don't get me wrong, but there will always be more powerful or richer people (as long as we're all physical beings ;) ).
And no, these laws aren't keeping the poor poor.  I would like to see your proof once again.  Or is it just your proof that since government exists and poor people exist that there's all the proof you need?
You can marry whomever you want, a state marriage is a set of benefits created to improve the stability of 'core' families.  And yes, I'm all for marriage of all kinds between consenting adults recognized by the state.  *Marriage is stupid in general.*
Why do you have a right to your money?  What makes it yours?  Isn't the state what gives you value to the money that you think is yours?  What about your land?  Why do you think you have a right to it?
Eventually you'll realize that we created government to define these whys (just like religion was created to define a whole other set of whys).

I believe in an open and intelligent market.  Power and wealth will always consolidate.  There has to be something to constantly fight this.  Sometimes we go too far, most of the times we're doing the right thing.

You're confusing 'store of value' with 'this should be stored away'.
If it wasn't a 'store of value' it wouldn't have any value and couldn't be used as a medium of exchange. It's purpose primarily is as a medium of exchange. If it's not moving, it's not working.

Stop trying to put the chicken before the egg.
Microsoft is not exclusively selling to Bitcoin holders. There are less protections when buying with Bitcoin (no refunds, that's what Microsoft says) and you can't even buy Office with it.
*NO ONE* is going to buy Bitcoin because you can buy Xbox stuff with it unless they already enamored with Bitcoin itself. It's already super easy to buy Microsoft stuff with fiat. Bitcoin improves on this process a total of 0.
Bitcoin's perception is that it's useful and better for illegal things, and it's absolutely true. Bitcoin is far and above better for illegal activities than fiat. That's how it works, the illegal purposes of Bitcoin *HAVE driven* adoption. 
This is great for those of us who already own Bitcoin as a means to get rid of it, but only pure ignorance to how adoption works would conclude that this will mean anything towards adoption.

Oh, an Office Space reference, never seen that one (haha, of course I have, it's all the same BS responses).
How many interstates would exist without the government?  How many roads in rural areas would be built?  How many mail services would offered to those in rural areas who were poor?  How confident would you be drinking from the tap?
Government has the fascinating ability to redistribute wealth in a way that creates stability for all.  The rich can get richer and the poor can not be so fucking poor that they revolt and destabilize society.
That's why smart rich people love government and why poor people understand it's kind of the best that they are going to get.  No amount of non-governance is going to solve that.

I don't have a crystal ball, but no matter how much you want to pretend Bitcoin is decentralized it relies pretty fucking heavily on Western infrastructure to operate (just like everything else online).
And you think that sending money instantly across the world for a small fee isn't possible with other currencies? You are sadly mistaken.
Bitcoin has very few advantages over your normal advanced, Western fiat as the dominant currency. Sure, there is plenty of room for Bitcoin to be valuable in the niche markets, but in reality it's advantages are really weaknesses.

Quantitative easing has done an amazing job at stabilizing inflation, it's imperfect and can be abused obviously, there is no perfect solution.
However, a non standard currency forces the money to be spent. Wealth is distributed, loans can be made on things that actually have value regardless (and those items can gain value).
Our fiat system struggles enough with the money flowing back into the banks and major corporations pockets, but if they didn't even have to ever let it go in the first place? Boy, talk about the end of the 'middle class'.
A gold standard isn't even worthwhile anyways, it makes little sense (gold is not edible, it can be mined and if you don't have enough of it you can just invade a country that does).
Bitcoin is volatile because it's a commodity and the price is simply out of speculation. It's fixed supply means that if it ever becomes the standard of currency, the best bet is to hold onto it to make it become scarcer, thus increasing the value.

You know, as a veteran of several startups this is really the kind of thing you hear after series 'A' funding.  
We can do so much, we can solve every problem, we can introduce this and that. 
The problem is nobody wants that stuff. Honestly, the blockchain is cool and all but it's not incredibly unique or groundbreaking.  And what is in the best interest of the community is usually ignored by the individual, ruining a very novel goal of decentralization.
I've learned that when people start ignoring the real problems and become too enfatuated with the product it quickly dissolves.
Maybe I just have too much experience with grandiosity.

Why does this shit get uploaded? Is this a religion? Are you just supposed to have faith? 


*Are you fucking kidding me?*
Bitcoin has lost 75% of it's value in a calendar year and it hasn't been up and down, it has been consistently down, even with improving technologies, more trusted companies and wider commercial adoption.
Never in the history of Bitcoin (and it's a short one) has it seen this kind of dramatic fall. It literally has been diving into the ground (on seemingly nothing but good news) for 20% of it's existence.
The worst thing to happen to BTC was the $1,200 and it just might have killed it.

Except it's not competing with that.
The blockchain with the Bitcoin token might be somewhat decentralized, but that also makes it difficult to update, or create features for. It's a terrible product (in terms of being a product) -- private companies can make better products that perform better and give many of the same benefits.
This is a terrible analogy because it puts so much weight on decentralization which isn't a benefit for the vast majority of the business world.

So... how will it make it stronger? Why aren't we solving problems instead of saying 'that will be good for Bitcoin.' That doesn't make any sense. Maybe it's because there are no solutions to the problems. Maybe it's because for as wonderfully idealistic and progressive as the Blockchain is, it's not perfect and probably won't ever be.

The thing is, Bitcoin will never find universal adoption or even adoption to the point of any type of competition with the USD, Euro or any other future fiat currency.
It doesn't mean Bitcoin isn't a good idea, it just means that there's not enough for room for all of it, and BTC doesn't have the backing of armies.
The technology isn't bad, the initial distribution was poor, but it's not the blockchains fault this won't happen. The blockchain has been a wild success.
The fact that BTC is at $350 is a testament to what people can come together and do on the Internet. We can make up our own fucking currency, pretend it has value and after awhile it actually does.  You can actually buy shit with Bitcoin, and from major stores. That's fucking cool.
I don't really care to go into detail of what I think is wrong with Bitcoin itself because there are *just as many* things wrong with fiat (and money in general). It's not about what's better, it's about what exists.
Bitcoin will never be $10,000 a coin, it probably will never reach $1,000 again. But it's going to have value for many many years to come.
Bitcoin isn't a game-changer. Transaction fees are an often hidden and mild annoyance to the world and the need to move it across the world instantly is not really a need and it won't be long until traditional fiats are able to do this anyways.
The reason behind the inability to exchange funds globally is the instability of local currencies compared to the major fiats + remittance fees are in the their twilight.
In a matter of years the entire world will be connected to the Internet and borders of technology will be like the EU, open and transparent. Money will be exchanged even faster as legacy systems are replaced with their more modern counterparts. Competition will force the few basic benefits that Bitcoin has to be incorporated in everyday services. As an American, I don't remember the last time I had to pay an ATM fee. It's easier than ever to use ApplePay or Google Wallet or Softcard.
Bitcoin however *is doing it's job* pushing our fiat standards forward.
10 or 15 years in the future we'll still be shilling out fiat currencies but how we do it, how quickly we do it and how easily we do it will be partly in thanks to what we have accomplished growing and promoting Bitcoin.

Have no idea why people compare Bitcoin's adoption to email.
Until the US crumbles, Bitcoin will never supplant it as a world currency.

First of all, it's not millions of dollars.  It's fake currency.  I can send you millions of bytes of data as well, just because you have assigned value to it doesn't automatically give it value.  There are plenty of people in the world who give absolutely NO value to BTC.  In fact, it's the vast majority of people.
The infrastructure was created to send something to someone through a distributed ledger.  Just because you've decided to add a $ and amount *doesn't mean shit*.
It is absolutely worthless.  In fact, at one point in time this "currency" had a value of nothing and it was literally just **GIVEN** a value (no matter how small).
Perhaps you're too hung up on wishing it was successful without realizing that it's failing and failing hard.

Thanks for the warning, but I should warn you about the Ignorant Bullshit Fallacy that the majority of subscribes to.
He owes nothing more? Says who? Him? Who is he? Why does he matter? Why does he get to decide to do with my money? Where's my cut? My taxes provided him with the infrastructure to earn 'his' money, my taxes provided him with the nation's stability so he could confidently provide a service and/or product, my taxes provided him with the stability of the currency he received his money in.
It sounds like when you say he 'earned' it all he did was the final party in a long line of people who earned that.
I don't want to live in a socialist state just like everyone else here, but this constant selfishness with money that is only temporary in people's possession is truly ignorant and obnoxious.

@_date: 2015-01-27 16:51:44
Why would they use Bitcoin when they can build a better coin literally for $0? This thread is full of so much incredible fail I'm embarrassed I clicked on the same link.
This is why Bitcoin is good. It proves procedures (or, as you love to call it 'technology') that improve flow, reduce cost and can expand security.
Decentralization is completely unnecessary -- everything else that bitcoin 'offers' is completely unnecessary.
I know all of you are for some reason personally invested in Bitcoin -- but the fact is, Bitcoin will never be anything more than it is now. In fact, it's amazing that it's where it's at. Respect earned.
Because every 'solution' that Bitcoin can solve, fiat currencies can duplicate (besides decentralization). Decentralization is not even a benefit for a currency and deflation is certainly not a good thing.
I'll take your comments off the air.
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:33:26
It's weird, I went to a 90% white school and not a single point in my education did anything like you describe happen.
Or, are you referring to history class where we learned how whites were viewed as superior legally and morally. Or was it when interracial marriages were illegal? How about when colored folks were hanged for being colored?
No, maybe it was the time where I learned about every great white emperor or king that ruled the lands before us. Or maybe when we learned every Presidents name and face and guess what... they were 100% white males.
No, all you think is that because we realized as a society that treating each other with respect and equality starts with those in power and that the coloreds who for thousands of years were treated like shit, given no access to education and basically were excluded from the dominant white powers, that giving any kind of extra help or understanding is equal to just hating whites.

*Because merchants accept them.* Not everyone has iPads at retail locations for checking out, most businesses have legacy systems and that's why we still have credit cards.
You don't think people haven't come up with better purchasing technologies? You think Bitcoin is the first 'revolution' in purchasing?
No, not even close. Bitcoin is too convoluted for basic purchases anyways. Centralized sidechains will always be necessary for POS transactions.
Don't like credit cards, go to every business and give them an ipad or tablet. Our payment options will be near infinite and safe.

I'm not going to get in a back and forth on which company should be valued higher -- that's not my goal. I'm well aware of how capital funding works.
My point was that if the financial **potential** of this company is based around the elevator pitch; "imagine you've bought tickets at a concert and instead of receiving an e-ticket, you receive a private key..." -- then I'm embarrassed I spent actual time on making a legitimate startup.
Not only is that a terrible use case, it's not even framed in a way that sounds appealing. We already receive 'encrypted tokens' -- it's the barcode on a ticket.
I'm sure there are significantly better use cases, even things I maybe would use (probably not) -- but choosing that contrived crap is just, well, crap.

Your obsession with Bitcoin creates excuses. 
I literally am a UX designer, it's what I'm paid to do and I'm very good at what I do.
What you're assuming is that since the post-Bitcoin-selection process is bad, that means that the pre-Bitcoin-selection is affected. It's not the case. The post-Bitcoin-selection would see a lesser CTR only, not the payment selection method.
Bitcoin is a marginal payment system. The vast majority of people on have a debit/credit card. Even in theory it's a poor proposition to add Bitcoin, it just doesn't have a draw.
It really only means that Bitcoin doesn't have the following necessary to waste the retail space saying you accept it, as well as the mild infrastructure and personnel it takes accepting it. It doesn't obviously mean that Bitcoin can't be used as a payment method in theory.

Hey dar,
I was about to purchase a stupid fucking coffee mug set when I noticed you guys don't accept flaming jellybeans. You're a company selling stupid things, you don't accept flaming jellybeans? Seriyusslee?
Please consider giving up.
Flaming jellybeans are:
a. real money if enough people agree
b. if they don't have monetary value, they have intrinsic value because you can throw them at people and they will then be on fire.
c. free new customer (people have flaming jellybeans are mildly insane/retarded and literally give them away just because someone will take them).
d. An additional and unnecessary revenue stream at literally no cost to you besides the time integrating it, the confusion at your checkout screen that has proven to crush conversions.
e. Dead simple to integrate as long as you don't count the work you have to do to integrate it (and the resulting fires).
f. ZERO CHARGEBACK RISK - nobody wants their flaming jellybeans back... trust me, I've tried.
n. 100% savings on flaming jellybeans.
There is no reason not to accept flaming jellybeans because I fucking say so. Microsoft made the Kin, trust them in every decision they make.
And finally, you don't actually have to hold in flaming jellybeans, a company that has been around for like 3 months will happily accept them.
Get with the times guys, you want yourself to insane zealots start accepting drug money.

The improved functionality? You're just making shit up now. I won't argue that because it may or may not be true. But there's a reason why micro payments aren't standard on the web and it's 100% because of how much people hate it vs. the technology.

The problem wasn't we didn't have an effective payment tool (although yes, Bitcoin would a better option), the problem is fuck Micropayments. It's a lose-lose for everyone involved.

The problem with micro-payments is people fucking hate micro-payments. A very small minority prefers to pay a la carte for things and it's usually cheaper and more productive and better for the business and all involved when you pay for something one time and not continued to constantly open up your wallet for things. I'd rather have one person pay me $19 to access all things than 100 people hate the experience by paying $0.19 every article they want to read.
This of course has nothing to do with whether Bitcoin is good or bad -- obviously Bitcoin would be an excellent way to utilize micro-payments, but micro-payments fucking suck.

116M just isn't a lot of money in the scheme of things. however it's enough cash to legitimately PoC.
This shouldn't make the price jump because it's not a technical innovation or a significant adoption by consumers, but it's clearly a sign that the big investment names are trying to really give BTC infrastructure a shot.
Big names put money into infrastructure all the time, but it's good to see it in BTC.

@_date: 2015-03-19 00:54:32
Store of what value?
What gives BTC value besides supply and demand. And what is the demand for besides hodling and DarkNet?
Storing value is suggesting that Bitcoin has intrinsic value.  It doesn't. 
Just because Bitcoin has a finite amount doesn't instantly make it any type of store of value.

Because you would have to lend money out at a significantly higher interest rate -- making investments far more risky
Imagine if every investment had the same interest rate as a payday loan? Money would never be lent out because it would make more sense to hodl.
Without investment you cripple purchasing power, companies can't borrow money to start or survive, jobs topple, no one can afford to buy a house, economy collapses.
Sound fun?

Bitcoin is a decentralized startup where there is no CEO, business plan or customer support -- just a product.
Unfortunately, the founders and initial investors cashed out during Series B and now we're about to go public with a shell of a company.
Buy shares now!!!! We promise it won't be worthless right after the IPO.
Bitcoin is not a proven industry. Creating a startup within an environment that hasn't even proven itself yet? Immense rate of failure. Too many companies are trying to define a customer and create a customer instead of solving a specific and direct problem.
Bitcoin isn't succesfull because it solves a meta problem. Something Bitcoin itself doesn't even understand.
Bitcoin relies on too much chicken-egg-chicken scenarios. It's truly a miracle and victory that Bitcoin has even gotten this far. It's a true testament to those who believe in it and the talent of the small community of developers and engineers that have created a basic infrastructure.
But unfortunately the infrastructure isn't good enough to solve real-world problems on any type of scale. Maybe it could, if it had real-world money -- but you need to have real-world adoption first -- a simple improbability.
Good luck to all those who are working their butts off to solve a problem greater than themselves.

Plenty of room for Bitcoin though in general.

It would be better if instead of ignoring them, we simply learn from the pitfalls and advantages of Bitcoin to create better cryptos that solve specific user problems instead of a general statist issue.
Bitcoin doesn't have to be the last crypto -- it certainly was the first -- it has given proof of work that on at least some scale there is interest in a fluid currency like Bitcoin.
Only the future will tell us what will be necessary, we can only learn from our mistakes and accomplishments to continue to improve.
