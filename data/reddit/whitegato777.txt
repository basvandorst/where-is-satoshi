bitflyer is in the US now with zero fees beside withdraws. Are they still a no go or being licensed in the US might make it worth giving a try?

I appreciate the attempts. But gdax is owned by coinbase. And as far as I know you have to fund it from your coinbase account. Unless if there's another way to deposit money in gdax that I don't know about

I should mention that I'm in Washington state. So my options are very slim. We have some messed-up laws regarding cryptocurrency

I tried to wire money to Gemini but my bank won't let me. They say that the account is flagged for fraud. I find that kind of interesting since it's a licensed Exchange

can anyone verify this? I want to set up an unverified account and am willing to use a vpn but don't want bittfinex to shut me down.

They said I violated their user agreement. That's about as specific as they got. I've heard that if you transfer your Bitcoins from your coinbase to an unauthorized trading platform that they all close your account. Other than that I can't think of anything

I just setup my Gemini account and I've already had ID verification. For some reason I've wire transferring money to both bitflyer and Gemini and my bank says that they're both flagged for fraud warnings. Has anybody else in Washington state had problems transferring money to Gemini

You can use coinbase to get Bitcoins without fees. Look it up on YouTube. It's a method using coinbase. But yes coin base has fees but there's a way around it
