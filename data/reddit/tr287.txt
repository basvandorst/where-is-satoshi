It’s people who ask this kind of question whenever bitcoin comes down a little that are “what’s happening.”

May be? Lol DEFINITELY coming. At this price, it doesn’t jump because the average joe is investing a few hundred. These are big players and they know what they are doing.

Do they have fair market buy prices for Bitcoin? Or do they inflate the price by ridiculous amounts? 
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:02:33
Do you have experience trying and failing? Or are you just making an assumption?

Thanks for the info. I appreciate it. Do you have any experience with Circle? Someone else commented here and recommended it.

How kind of you to share your predictions. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:04:16
Thank you! I'm definitely gonna check it out.

$1100? Or? I’m confused. For each coin you hold you get that?

They are trying to slow the bleeding. Is that even legal? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:10:43
Question is, how much would that forked coin be worth? Any ideas? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:36:50
How much cheaper?

If I have money in coinbase is it as simple as just logging into gdax? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:47:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:42:17
Oh thanks. Had no idea. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:06:07
Do you need to go through all the verification to get gdax going or is the verification that was done through coinbase suffice?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:13:01
Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:22:44
Maybe even closer to $3200
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:47:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:42:17
Oh thanks. Had no idea.

What's a limit buy order? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:20:15
Ok. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:52:43
Not even centuries down the road.
