Metaexchange only holds funds while our customer's orders are open. We do not accept deposits. Currently we only support bitshares/BTC markets but we are adding other coins soon.

The miners control the network, not peter todd. If they don't take the change, no-one can use BIP66, it's that simple.

Didn't bitcoin suffer the same liquidity issue that you're saying is the problem with all altcoins?

Hi guys,
I wrote this article because I hadn't seen all the information bought together in one place with real world analogies.
Hope you enjoy it!
Cheers, Paul.

Bitcoin doesn't really have the features to support this in a clean way. That is the reason you can't find a decentralised exchange.
You could look at NXT or bitshares, both those coins have decentralised exchanges built in to their cores.

World population is a poor comparison - it ought to be first world population, since there will always be those who do not have access to a computer, or a mobile phone.

I've actually read these before - scanned them, actually. But still I find it hard to get a high level overview of what I should use this library for and what I shouldn't expect it to do?
For example. is it like bitcoinj? Is there a wallet component at all?
Use cases would really help developers get an idea of whether this is suitable for them :)
Cheers, Paul.
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:19:37
This looks fantastic, but can I ask for a few example use cases?
What can't you do with this?
Would it be easy to extend to handle altcoins which are forked from bitcoind?
Cheers, Paul.

You need 800MB of main RAM and swap on top of that... Not sure what the PI specs are.

In this first article in a series, I talk about designing an algorithmic trading framework for Bitcoin running on the Huobi exchange.
Hope you enjoy it!

Thanks, that helps get a better idea of what NBitcoin is about :)

I wrote this article which gives an understanding of how things in bitcoin work under the hood: 
Hope it helps!

In this article I talk about how bitcoin developers can implement a watch-only wallet on top of bitcoind.
Watch only wallets are sadly unsupported in the current version of the standard bitcoin client, but it isn't too hard to get them working using bitcoind RPC calls.
Hope it helps some developers out there!

Hi guys,
In this 2nd part of the series I explore an implementation of an academic paper which attempts to deal with the adverse selection problem identified in the previous installment!
Cheers, Paul.

If you truly believed you couldn't change anything, you wouldn't be a bitcoin developer.

The protocol exists inside every client, miners cannot change every client. Bitcoin developers control the protocol. The only thing a 51% attack can achieve is double spends on transactions sent by the miner and DOS by withholding transactions from blocks.

"Citigroup has built its own digital currency based on bitcoin and the blockchain. This, in itself, isn’t very difficult – anyone can create a cryptocurrency in a few seconds with a bit of programming knowledge"
Yeah... if only satoshi ought to have known that before he spent years working on it, and his predecessors before him - they could have saved themselves the trouble!

We've just added bitUSD and BTS markets. Come check us out if you want an easy way into Bitshares from Bitcoin!

The orderbook is probably the most valuable tool traders can have access to.
At the very least, you can tell right away where the bias in the market is - if you look at the OB and the sum of the volume in particular, you can compare the buy side to the sell side for each price-point. If one side is way higher than the other and assuming market orders come in at random, its likely that the market will consume all the orders on the side with less volume therefore moving the price in that direction.
You can get a more visual representation of this on sites like  (bottom of the page)...
Forex traders don't even have access to the orderbook, so feel privileged that you can even do this kind of analysis.

If this is true, why did all the bitcoin exchanges in the UK close?

That's the minimum traded volume. When I was building my bot, I would have it trade only at that volume to make sure I didn't lose a lot very quickly.
Could be newbey human or bot traders.

He's called 'thermos' now, whether he likes it or not. The people have voted.

Bitcoin business need to cash out to fiat at some point and the weekend is a good time to do so, as long as not everyone is doing it because you'll get less value for money.
That's one explanation for why this is happening on a thursday instead of a friday.
@_date: 2013-06-09 17:19:56
It's just a bunch of sells at minimum volume for the same price. Nothing really that odd - MtGox doesn't aggregate multiple transactions at the same price and direction for some reason.

That looks like bitcoin is about to destroy humanity.
Better to have it replace the sun to give the intended impression of saviour.
@_date: 2013-09-11 07:05:02
A currency and a stock exchange are two different things. That's like saying, 'oranges will replace the grocery store'.

If it was mitigated by incapsula, why were users complaining about patchy access, or the site being down?
@_date: 2013-07-17 19:08:59
The openId only sign up is a mistake - lots of people wont have an open ID and those that do might not want to use it in this instance.
In addition, the site still looks *very* sparse (although better than V1) - I'm not sure it inspires confidence in something that you'd deposit your own money into. It doesn't look 'expensive' which might lead users to think its been thrown together.
Acquiring users is hard - have you advertised? Buying signature space on bitcointalk.org might be a cheap way to gain users, or running a trading competition, or posting bounties for bugs etc etc.
Hope that helps!
Cheers, Paul.

How sure are you about that? I was under the impression that FinCEN classes bitcoin as a type of money, therefore you'd need to register just as cryptsy.com has.

The article is pretty inaccurate in a number of places - for example:
"With current economic times being as uncertain as they are, currencies are fluctuating greatly every day. For some in the Foreign Exchange market, this constant ebb and flow is good, but for many others it makes for difficult work. With the emergence of the new ‘Bitcoin’ currency, Forex trading might just have become a little easier."
EURUSD moved between 1.3266 and 1.3342 over the course of the last day, that's $0.0076, whereas BTCUSD moved between 105.1 and 107.6, which is $2.50, making BTCUSD a good 300 x more 'fluctuating'.
In addition, the article misses a few of the real benefits of trading bitcoins:
*) No brokers, you deal directly with the exchange, so there are no conflict of interests like you get with forex brokers betting against you.
*) Full market depth is available unlike in forex which makes judging future price movements easier
*) Massive volatility in BTCUSD means there is a lot of money to be made
*) No huge minimum trades - in forex you are forced to trade in (large) fractions of $100,000 lot sized orders, whereas in bitcoin you can trade 0.01 BTC ($1)
Cheers, Paul.
