Duh, atwebpages.com is a free subdomain service, whoever is running the scam will nullroute or point it elsewhere once he finds out about this post.

Exactly! What the fuck is this, who the fuck do you think you are Kraken ?
@_date: 2016-04-21 08:19:36
Dude, you got ripped off!

I just found a 'show log' link in the bottom right corner, seems like there is a client ID : 
["log","Wed, 08 Oct 2014 11:14:05 GMT","[backend] Requesting client ID"]
["log","Wed, 08 Oct 2014 11:14:05 GMT","[backend] Client ID received"]
["log","Wed, 08 Oct 2014 11:14:05 GMT","[backend] Listening on client ID","5eb2f396-060d-4af8-DELETED
Why request ClientID ? Someone from trezor should answer these questions!
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:44:51
You're kidding right ? This shit looks terrible.

How hard would it be to brute force the pin on trezors with no passphrase protection ?
@_date: 2014-10-12 22:33:47
Do  you run it off your own blockchain or does Electrum use a remote blockchain ?
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:04:53
Can others also confirm that my transaction history is actually pulled from the blockchain and not stored on their servers ? It does not sound right, its too fast. As soon as i connect the device via USB my transaction history (over 100 transactions) appears right away, i doubt its pulling the info from the blockchain..
EDIT : Even if pulling from blockchain, its pulling from THEIR blockchain. How can we be certain they are not storing queries on their servers ??
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:37:41
Oh, i think its too late...  Goodbye World!
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:31:05
That wont help, they probably see the device ID and can link it to the address they sent the trezor to.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:44:45
The one on the left is nice, the one on the right, not so much.
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:14:40
Its too late you greedy idiots. First you've postponed the launch for months hoping to bank - guess what, its not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 23:45:38
No sane miner would dump bitcoin at this silly price. Miners are hodling.

@_date: 2014-10-12 23:03:01
If using Electrum remote servers for blockchain syncing its the same as on mytrezor.com..
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:40:41
Bitcoin will never go mainstream because of this. NEVER. Unless they figure out a way via sidechains.
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:00:36
Trezor also shares your master public key with mytrezor.com - they know ALL your transactions, to and from trezor!
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:02:14
2btc ? Really ?? Go beg someplace else..
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:45:20
Yes, i see the part where it submits the master public key to their servers! This is a huge privacy-leak! I wont be using trezor until i can run everything on my local PC!

Any way to order via totalwine.com with bitcoin ?
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:14:08
Haha, such bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:25:47
1. BoP stands for ?
2. BoP requests and stores my account public keys ? BoP knows all my transactions ?
3. Web wallet is hosted on local PC or mytrezor.com ?
Why would I allow anyone to see/store my transaction details ?? Its still unclear if they request/store device id!
5. What is ClientID that their server requests every time you open mytrezor.com

Disregard the article, people of Serbia are very much involved in the development of Bitcoin. Author is also not Serbian and misunderstood the official national bank release/announcement so .. disregard..

There is an easy fix - disallow instant btc withdrawals. Push withdrawals once a day , after manual review.
@_date: 2016-03-23 20:26:12
You called him an alt 'creator'
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:57:22
No, they are not. There is no way they can cover 5 million without a loan. NO WAY. 
EDIT : Would not be suprised if they asked Pantera for a loan...  EDIT2: Let me tell you what happens next, once open, traders rush to exchange fiat for btc in hope of withdrawing to own wallet immediately. btc holders do the same. Eventually the exchange runs out of btc. Stamped.
