FTP-Newsgroups-Top tier private trackers ftw. Paying for warez is utter nonsense. This won't fly.

You have a point there, Megaupload was financially successful. The number of participants might be large enough for Dotcom to make some substantial dough. Most people are not pirates. Though most people don't get BTC either. I guess in the warez context lots of people take what comes easy and won't put in any "work". Let's hope they will do the mental work to get into BTC but I'm not exactly counting on it unless things get dumbed down (appear more simple) quite a bit.

Are you claiming dentistry is decentralized because LJR CAN open said brutal dental practice or what?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:02:04
You do that.

The BCash people will just introduce something else to try to take over BTC just like they did with BitcoinXT, BitcoinClassic, BitcoinUnlimited and now BCash. 
They will never be back. 
It's a very small group relative to the ecosystem anyway which explains the 100% failure rate so far.

you will probably be dead yourself before BTC will be a regular currency anywhere
yes me as well
the system has not even started to fight back in a serious way and if it does it will on the one hand give legitimacy to the struggle but on the other hand make life f*cking hard to the point of unlivable for the (it's) opposition just because it can and it won't even break a sweat doing so
life as an outcast does not exactly grant anybody any power to enforce change now does it
no evolving technology is going to do a damn thing to help that situation it's hearts and minds that need to be captured
the system is well setup to prevent that so that is where some sort of a grass roots movement a groundswell type of thing should come in if you ask me
people not technology will make the difference

Could you add a link to the pdf since it's not in the link you provided.
If not you can give us readers a rundown of the technical side of things in your own words since you must have studied the results seeing you keep mentioning them like they contain some sort of impenetrable truth.
Thanks in advance for the info you are about to provide.
