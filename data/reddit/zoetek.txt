Hello Bitcoin Community! After watching the recent hearings held in NYC! I was disappointed with the second day panel &amp; the negative imprint they were trying to convey! So I decided to put a personal spin to this &amp; try to show the naysayers they are wrong! I live in Syracuse, NY like most cities we have a problem with our homeless community! I want to help &amp; want to  - I'm calling it  - help me &amp; my community &amp; lets reinforce how powerful the Bitcoin protocol truly is! All charitable donations will go to local organization in my community! Please join me today! I will try me best to get in front of the ESPN cameras &amp; hold my QR statement up! Please join me &amp; pass the word! Thank You!!
