So what you're saying is bitcoin should not be used? 
You just want your store of value and are not interested in all the benefits bitcoin has had over fiat money.

Always do your own research, ethereum is quite different to bitcoin (Not designed to be a currency, but still more useful than BTC atm) 
You can see ethereum as a platform and ether as the gas that has to be paid for running smart contracts on that platform.

And i didn't say anything about merchants. 
Just about ppl who use the network. Merchants are not everything

i think ripple will have its place in the world but is xrp rly needed to process on the network? some sauce for that would be nice :)
and btw i would recommend to add ether to your list as potential long term investments

The reason why bitcoin is going down ist quite easy if you followed some discussions in other subs.
Many people sold their altcoins to get "free coins" and since there are no such they are switching back again. Bitcoin is still holding stronger than i expected. But (No FUD Just observation) altcoin ratios are quite low at the moment so traders sellpressure will be there for some time.
And please stop blaming people for changing ship. The ones who actually use the network have no reason to stay here for now. If it gets better they will come back so there's No reason to blame the ones who doesn't want to spend that high fees (or wait that long for the transaction to be confirmed)
