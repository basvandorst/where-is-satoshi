The problem with the block size thing is that it made it turn out that bitcoin still needed economic planning. It wasn't this pure self correcting honey badger, it still needed people making economic decisions and that ruined the party for a lot of people. Even people in favor of the block size increasing saw that it needed to appeal to people to do it, not to the block chain or self correction.

Bitcoin didn't in any way invent hashing things. Nor is it the first ledger recognized by the government (although it's not actually one of those) so why would it be given status as a way to notarize things? If you set your car plates (a database the government views as legitimate) to a hash you wouldn't be given special treatment under the law for that, so why would you for bitcoin? What is unique about bitcoin?

Bitcoin can't handle any transactions per second, only per block, spaced on average 10 minutes apart. When people say transactions per second they are only speaking averages across the minutes. Bitcoin would not let you sell and resell things in rapid time like that at all with any block size.

The average block size today is .36 megabytes, very just barely over 1/3rd of the limit. I know dogma is that bitcoin is gonna blow up any second now but we aren't actually even remotely near the limit.

They had to orphan 6 hours of transactions to fix it. That effected the economy very little because bitcoin is not actually used for anything and throwing out 6 hours throws out little if anything of value. We could probably throw out 6 months of bitcoin transactions and have undone less sales than companies lose from workers dropping merchandise.  But that is hardly an advantage.

Bitcoin can only handle 2.7 transactions per second. People hope to raise it to 55. (Visa could process a max at above 24,000 per second).
However to make that change they basically have to make an altcoin called bitcoin and then convince everyone to forget about current bitcoin and use the altcoin. 
There is also worry that miners fees are basically nonexistant now and someone needs to figure out a way to make bitcoin get paid for by something other than the huge inflation happening now. Some people think making transactions need a market is the way to do that.

If someone just edited the variable to allow 1TB blocks that still wouldn't help. The transfer time on large blocks would be so large that whoever made a small block would always orphan the larger block. 
Solutions to this have also been proposed and maybe will be implemented some day. But it does prevent bitcoin from scaling suddenly. If bitcoin took off tomorrow and got a million users a day it'd simply cease functioning. The block limit would cap things and if it was removed the miners that mined smaller blocks would always win. Fixes for these things are only in the future right now. Not things someone could throw up in a minute if bitcoin suddenly became popular.

What laws apply to a thing depend how you are using a thing. 
If you dropped a big bag of dollars on someone and crushed someone to death it'd be the murder weapon but the police would not declare all dollars murder weapon. If you built a big tower of quarters and used it to broadcast radio the FCC would be the one that dealt with you but it would not make all quarters into radio equipment. 
It's quite simple. If you are making futures options the commodity guys deal with it. That does not mean that in other situations it will also be treated as a commodity. If you block the fire exit with a box of pennies it will break the law that objects can not block fire exits but it doesn't mean all money is now counted as objects and only laws applying to objects apply to money and they need to make up their mind because bank account balances aren't objects.

Like if someone wanted to borrow your car and you didn't quite trust them so you asked for them to give you 100 bucks that you'd give back at the end and then you saw them asking some other friend for a loan for 100 bucks to cover it don't you think you'd feel uncomfortable about that situation?

Right now the blockchain can handle a maximum of 7 transactions per second under ideal conditions about about 3 transactions per second under real world conditions. For several years there has been discussion about fixing that issue someday but as of yet it has not been fixed and there is no ETA on when it will be fixed. 
So the answer is maybe someday but right now no more than 260,000 people could use bitcoin a day one single time. The most popular plan is to raise the block size by 20x in a few years so in a few years maybe 5 million people could use it a day.

People DO evaluate the safety of having their money in dollar bills and virtually no one intentionally carries large percentages of their wealth in physical bills because that would be stupid and irresponsible.

 Okay so 'What about software bugs?' 'What if it's hacked?' 
those are valid questions. Bitcoin has had several bugs including malliablity stuff fucking up a ton of stuff right now and once someone hacked themselves 184 bitcoin. Neither of those are invalid concerns.
Beyond that when people say "bitcoin" they pretty much mean the end to end ecosystem and aren't going to be impressed if you isolate "bitcoin" down to just one aspect of the protocol and when they have their wallet hacked having you tell them "oh ho ho ho, you see it wasn't bitcoin that was hacked, it was a wallet!" like that helps them in any way.

you are confusing the malleability attack with immutable. Malleability changes things BEFORE they are in the blockchain, once something is in the blockchain it's supposed to be eternal and unchangeable. 
(the fact that is a lie and many blockchains have had the blockchain retroactively changed is something you are supposed to ignore. Even bitcoin itself has 50 blocks that were thrown away and can not be looked at ever again due to someone hacking themselves 184 billion bitcoin, but trust us, we will never alter the blockchain ever again, you can have faith in us)

There is 5441 nodes, in general a transaction that isn't getting mined will eventually be forgotten by all of them. But it wouldn't break any rules at all if one kept rebroadcasting the transaction forever, or even if it got forgot then one random node decided to rebroadcast it years later!

Bitcoin as a protocol still lacks a true specification. Right now the bitcoin protocol is absolutely defined as "the thing bitcoin core does", tcp or something there is a paper defining every aspect, in bitcoin it's only the code right now that tells the details as they actually run.

It never works to buy an exact amount in bitcoin. You always have to buy more than you need, the price changes rapidly and whatever 175 dollars worth now isn't guaranteed to be 175 worth tomorrow, but it's also not guaranteed to be 175 worth in 5 minutes. (The price can also go up so you have more than enough, but there is never any way to know in advance, there really isn't even a good way to know how much more than the price you have to buy either! I can say buy 5 dollars extra but then someone could point to times 5 dollars wouldn't have been enough!)

The place that falls apart is that mining equipment once bought keeps existing and doesn't vanish. So if it goes down you have people left with a box of equipment that can now ruin the currently network and you simply need to trust them not to (or not to sell it to someone who would want to.)

The theory is fees will handle it and people will mine to get fees.
You are supposed to ignore that fee amounts have dropped over time and that they currently make up less than 1/3rd of 1% of the income miners get. 
Bitcoin basically has to go to the moon or be dead in a few years. (or more realistically: miners will change the mining schedule and bitcoin people will gnash their teeth about that but ultimately be powerless to stop it)

But every hard fork inadvertently removes other versions and leaves a time where only one exists so need to be avoided at all costs.  Since they leave a time where they are the only client on the network, which means there is a period of time where an unfortunate bug could shut them down entirely and leave the network nodeless or even more nightmare scenario might have a bug that makes an invalid blockchain and kills every current version of the ledger on earth requiring a rollback to before the upgrade.

The current miners have the stockpile. Because they are currently mining. If in ten years bitcoin can only support a mining pool 1% as big then all the other 99% that exists now just has to go in a landfill or something, or someone can buy it or the old owners can use it as they please.

Make sure to ask in advance if you want the fee to be below a certain point though or the developers might suddenly release a patch raising it!
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:50:03
The answer is simple: It's not because of government indoctrination or because people are scared of new things. It's because of the get rich quick stuff.
Nothing in the protocol is a get rich quick scam, don't get me wrong. But you would have to be blind to not notice that there is a HUGE contingent of people in the bitcoin community who's only interest in bitcoin is hoping they can invest in it then later something will happen and later they can cash out for more money. 
That isn't every single person but it's a stink that clings to so many aspects of bitcoin. People try to rope businesses and individuals into bitcoin not because bitcoin would help the business or the individual but because of some imagination it's the path to personal wealth. 
people can smell a get rich quick scam, and maybe when you are telling your grandma they need to put their life savings into bitcoin you really mean it and really think it's a good idea, but for every person like you there is 40 others telling her she needs to put her money in bitcoin because they hope it means their 240 dollars will be 250 dollars and not for her benefit at all.
