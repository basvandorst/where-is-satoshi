There is no legal distinction between parody and satire. And, according to your definition of satire, it would actually be MORE likely to pass the Fair Use test because commenting on the original work is actually a factor that is in favor of the satire/parody.

Whether or not another company benefits from image has no effect on the Fair Use analysis. The Fair Use test only examines whether the creator of the work has a commercial purpose.

I think you might be confusing trademarks and copyright. The copyright is for the entire image, so changing the U to an O doesn't make much of a difference as to whether or not this is Fair Use.
Likewise, changing the U is not necessary to make the work "transformative." The right half of the image is already providing commentary.

Unless OP is planning on selling copies of his image, it is hard to see how the work has a commercial purpose.

ITT: a bunch of redditors arguing about copyright law and then it turns out that it was a trademarks issue the whole time. =)

It isn't obvious from the Stanford site, but apot1 is right; courts permit 100% reproduction. A quick quote from the most recent big Fair Use case Cariou v. Prince:


of our sister circuits has ever ruled that the copying
of an entire work favors fair use[,].... courts have
concluded that such copying does not necessarily
weigh against fair use because copying the entirety
of a work is sometimes necessary to make a fair use
of the image.”

Comparative advertising appears to be a trademark/Lanham Act issue, not a copyright issue.
Anyway, fair use is not limited to parody. Parody is just one possible "use" that might be considered fair.
