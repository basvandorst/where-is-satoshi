That's IF miners accept all the "spam" transactions. It's in their best interest not to completely fill blocks with spam transactions though.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:46:31
Its not a 2x increase per day. It constantly sets the maximum block size to twice the average block size of the last 144 blocks found.

Can multisig be used across multiple wallets programs? For instance, sign one transaction with electrum and with armory. Or maybe even electrum + mycellium (or other wallet that doesn't support multisig)?

Really? When I install linux on my pc, everything works right off the bat. If I was to install Windows, I would have to find the driver for each individual piece of hardware and install it.

If I install Electrum and make a super secure long password but someone gets a hold of my 12 word seed, can they transfer my coins or do they also need my password too?

Why aren't more pools doing this? Seeing as a 51% attack is a major flaw, large pools like BTC Guild and GHash.io shouldn't exist at 28% and 32% distribution.

Indeed. From : [screencap of comment in question](  I don't see anything wrong with what Andreas said. Nothing he said asked for us to upvote his content. He asked us to weed out the good and bad comments with our votes. Not "upvote my post", which WOULD have been against the rules.
[My reaction to the banning](
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:05:58
1) Would we know if a 51% attack was occurring or could it go unnoticed (as long as it wasn't just 1 big pool)?
2) Are we sure about the number of Bitcoins currently in existence or are we just trusting the figures of blockchain.info, etc? Do people actually verify the numbers on the blockchain?

1. As more and more people buy bitcoins, this becomes harder to do as the wealth is more widespread.
2. Retailers can accept Bitcoin but can opt to receive cash instead of the Bitcoins.

Yes, passphrase is a password basically. Just don't make it too short like 1234 or something super easy to brute force into.
Some clients have a built in option to "backup wallet" where it'll give you the option to choose a backup location. Otherwise you could just locate and copy/paste the wallet.dat file. They both do the same thing. I would read a little more into whichever client you use just to be safe. For instance, if you use the Bitcoin-qt wallet frequently (40+ transactions) you'll have to do backups occasionally as there are only 100 keys in the wallet's key pool. Unless you use Electrum or another client with a seed.

Isn't that sort of one of the points of Bitcoin though? To use as a payment system to bypass the ridiculous credit card fees or Paypal, etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:55:50
I wonder how accurate that really is. It just goes to show how early in the Bitcoin adoption we are if only 731,782 addresses have more than $12 in BTC.

What does "verifying the entire block chain" do exactly? Is that mining? Can it earn BTC if you leave it running?

The problem with storing them online is the site could be hacked or they can just decide to shut down and take everyone's money. I would only keep enough online that you will need to trade/sell.

I may have exaggerated a little. What I mean is that people who only have &lt;5 BTC shouldn't really worry about paper wallets. They're probably more likely to lose the paper than have their wallet compromised.

At [20:43]( in the video he talks about setting the solution for blocks at 10 minutes. With asics/more computing power, could the limit be reduced to 1 minute or even less without compromising stability/etc? And would this also increase the speed of confirmations as well? I feel like this would greatly increase the adoption of Bitcoin as transactions can be confirmed much quicker.

All currency would be worth nothing. It would go back to the times where people exchanged items for other items.

Actually, if they spend the Bitcoin and buy it back, it has 0 effect on the market. When they spend the bitcoin, it's usually given right to the exchange to sell and the merchant receives cash, then the person buys it back. Hence no change in price. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:26:56
Demand. The price has been going up so rapidly too that some exchanges take longer to correct.
And actually, if USD is worth more than CAD, the price of Bitcoin in CAD should be higher than USD, not lower. (1USD = 1.06CAD) so is everything else is equal, a bitcoin worth $1,200USD should be $1,272CAD.

Are you sure it was Coinbase and not the phishing site Coinibase or w/e that popped up not long ago? Always verify the address when you're giving personal information online.

I really hope Bitcoin takes off and becomes a conventional form of payment. It'll be one more step towards globalization.
In order for this to happen, people have to actually spend it to increase the popularity in its true purpose besides "zomg XXXX% return on investment".

The greater the adoption, the greater the success.

You should probably read up a little more but:
You need to download a wallet client for your computer (Bitcoin-qt, Armory, etc). Then you need to look at that wallet's receiving address. On Coinbase, you'd click on withdraw BTC and send them to your offline wallet's receiving address. This will pull them from Coinbase's online wallet and off into your offline wallet. Exchanges usually have a small fee for this. If you wanted to sell them on Coinbase or another exchange, you'd look up the wallet address on Coinbase, then send to that address the BTC from your offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:39:21
You could just rename them temporarily.

As a Bitcoin noob, how safe is using an app like this to store your bitcoins? I recently made my first purchase of bitcoins in the last week through localbitcoins and just left them in their online wallet. What are the risks with leaving them where they are vs withdrawing to a wallet like this? 
And what if something happens and my phone is stolen? Do I lose access to whatever is stored in my wallet?

Transaction fee? It goes to pay/reward the people mining. These are the people that basically verify funds/process transactions. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:03:53
One thing you have to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is still new. There has been nothing like this before. Everything revolving around it has to adapt and this takes time. 
I don't know if you've heard but Bitcoin ATM machines are just making their way to the public now. And what's going to come after that? It's getting easier and easier to acquire Bitcoin every day. It's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:53:05
This. This is what people don't understand. IF Bitcoin becomes popular, truly popular, the price will be MUCH higher. Think of all the money in the world. If Bitcoin becomes the world's currency, its value will be astronomical as there is a limit of only 21 million Bitcoins.

Local storage isn't complicated at all. Just download one of the recommended wallet clients, then withdraw from the online wallet to the offline wallet address. Throw on encryption, a passphrase, and backup the wallet to a few locations (not just the 1 PC). Just make sure you DO NOT LOSE YOUR PASSPHRASE! You can't touch the money if you can't remember the passphrase. There is no recovery option.
I think most people are going a little overboard on paper wallets/etc. But just withdrawing them to an offline wallet and backing up in several locations is more than enough. The only time you'd really have to worry about paper wallets is if you have several thousand bitcoins. Or perhaps your browsing habits are terrible and you always have viruses/trojans.

This is great news. Even better than the market price of Bitcoin. What we want to see is adoption/breakthrough. Only then will we see the true value of Bitcoin.

It would be better if it was announced that "so and so is selling 100,000 BTC" and it was confirmed that it was from 1 address. That way people wouldn't freak out and sell everything. It would create the perfect time to buy though.
edit* I suppose they could just find some large buyers at under market price to buy some in bulk.

That's what turn me away the first few times I wanted in on it over the last couple years. I recently looked at [localbitcoins.com]( though and you can choose the method you want to buy from people. Meet up and pay cash, cash deposit at a bank, etc. Quick and easy to set up and acquire Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:34:25
In all fairness though bitcoin mining is unprofitable unless you have the latest ASIC equipment. I'd look at a [profitability calculator]( to see if you'll pull a profit.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:43:56
It's going to be hard to concentrate on mining when people are swinging gold bars at each other though. You sure didn't think that through.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:15:07
It's entirely possible that is it a bubble. Then again so can anything else be. Stock prices? The price is just what people determine its value to be. Bitcoin prices have been exploding over the last few years as they become widespread and adopted around the globe. More and more people are seeing the value in Bitcoin every day and buying into the concept. This pushes the price up even higher as more people want to buy them. They will continue to rise at a high rate until a major event destroying them or eventual global acceptance and use as a major currency (everyone using them daily instead of other currencies). 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:14:15
It could very well be worth it then. Especially if the value of BTC keeps increasing as it has been. It might not turn out to be a bad little small investment.

That is true. A lot of people who couldn't work their way around computers would have difficulties. That said, if you can sign on to reddit and can manage to comment on relevent threads, you can probably manage to send money from one wallet to another. All it takes is copying the receiving address from the receiving wallet, and pasting it in the sending address of the sending wallet.
