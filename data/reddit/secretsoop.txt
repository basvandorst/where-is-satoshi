You are right, An Android device (good one like S6) wallet in simple user hand is safer than Windows's one. didn't explain why Google care about inserting backdoor for $[X]00 in average user wallet which will be used to buy gift cards and so...
The core wallet and other desktop good wallets are general solution (and safe+private in some environments). But in some situations they can't be used because portability and user interface.
For advanced users who need portability in pocket they can install Copperhead Android OS and other security focused Android forks/versions.

Android wallets are fine if it is on a device with low probability of backdoor on it.

`Computer` can be anything, Compare the security of well managed QubesOS in Librem laptop against clean Android with Bitcoin wallet.
True that the 1st one is very secure but what about the usability? and how much that poor simple user need to know (Managing GNU/Linux and its CLI, Networking, Tor, Isolation and virtual machines, Encryption tools, Data backup, ...)  just to buy gift card or pay for goods/services?
In simple user management: clean new Android is safer than Windows.

Using new device from very famous brand (Samsung devices or Nexus) is better than a unknown Chinese brand with an flash app that have every possible permission like Doogee.

Get people and pages from Facebook search (moroccankingdom), and try to get there history googling (with the "") "moroccankingdom team" or "moroccankingdom" hack.
Scroll and you will find a lot of pages and hacktivist people.
I'm interested if the FBI and INTERPOL take the case since it's international case with a LOT of cash that can be used in "evil" politics, BTW they are very active about Morocco vs West Sahara politic problem.
But, Are you some company or organization? or just an early investor?

One word is like trying only ~7k word which is nothing in computer time. You have to be careful with those software because many contain backdoor/spyware.
