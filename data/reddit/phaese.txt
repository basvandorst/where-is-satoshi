did you even read the comment you're replying to?
you can own US dollars and US bonds at the same time.
imagine you have $1,000,000.
you want to be able to cover near-term expenses, so you set aside $200,000 as cash.
you want to save the other $800,000.
however, you don't just want it sitting around doing nothing, because inflation.
however, you also don't want to put it in stocks or other assets, because you think they're risky.
you decide to put it in US bonds, because you think the US treasury is very likely to repay them.
the whole point of bonds is that you give X money now, so that at some later date you can get Y &gt; X money back.
let's say the US government is charging $50 for a $100 bond that matures in 20 years.
so, you buy $800,000 worth of those bonds.
so, you end up with $200,000 physical cash, and $1,600,000 worth of bonds.
however, you have to wait 20 years to turn the bonds back into real cash.
(you can buy/sell bonds anytime with other private entities, though -- no need to wait 20 years. market decides the price of your bonds.)

there is a debt. it just so happens that the debtor is also the sole issuer of the owed asset.

there's some debate about whether the following is actually possible. but in the most privacy-bullish view of LN, it will be possible to have... (where each &lt;-&gt; is a channel)
you &lt;-&gt; rando &lt;-&gt; rando &lt;-&gt; ... &lt;-&gt; rando &lt;-&gt; party you're transacting with
and it will be possible to route the transaction through a tor-like network of intermediaries, where each intermediary doesn't have knowledge of the overall source or destination.
I'm not sure if that's too optimistic or not. but definitely with LN, transactions are off-chain, and it's easier to keep off-chain data private

i'm not arguing for a ban, or even that the effects aren't net positive. i'm arguing that there are some negative effects.

what people are saying is: pretend you are given $X in cash. you can distribute it over whatever assets you want. call it asset distribution D.
but you *do* have $X in wealth now, it's just not all in cash. you should immediately redistribute it to distribution D. it doesn't matter *how* you arrived at having $X in wealth.
(the only exception to this is tax considerations; your tax liabilities may be affected by some redistributive actions.)
this is essentially the endowment effect:

i think it's a good thing that bitcoin makes it easier to bypass government oppression. i understand that neither humans nor any algorithm can distinguish between "government oppression" and "illegal / unethical" to everyone's satisfaction.
your post is fine. saying bill gates "knows that bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the world government he yearns for" is bs

+1. people in this thread need to get a grip. just because he insulted your rocket ship to the moon doesn't make him a bad person. he's spent the past 20 years trying to figure out the best possible ways to spend 44 billion dollars helping humanity.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:27:32
right. illegal activity made easier by bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:14:31
bill's point isn't crazy. cryptocurrencies definitely have made it easier to do black market transactions over the internet. (IOW bitcoin doesn't simply supplant cash-based black market transactions, it expands the black market size by making some types of txn easier.)
the problem w/ his comment is that it ignores all the positive effects of cryptocurrencies, of course

do you not think people can find philanthropy fulfilling? why do you think he's doing it, to make his 93rd billion dollars?

srs question: what are these pictures supposed to be showing? CNN interviewed the students?
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:42:06
a.k.a.: buy monero :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:29:09
right, but crypto makes it easier. why did wannacry ask for btc, not mailed USD?
we can talk about the principles of whether money movement should be traceable by law enforcement or not, but crypto definitely has the potential to make that tracing more difficult. (depends on the crypto &amp; other specifics though.)

picture [1]: Nothing about the photos suggests she's a student. I'm probably missing some context.
picture [2]: I don't know the context of the photo on the left. I'm assuming this is a photo with CNN staff. I agree it's weird for these students (and/or CNN shills) to be taking a photo with CNN staff. The other arguments in this photo are not strong. Not looking "distraught" enough for a photo doesn't indicate anything, ever been to a funeral? 80k followers is actually not that much, this was a huge national news story; currently the top post on reddit (cute baby and dog photo) has 40k upvotes.
picture [3]: Looks like this guy spent summer(s) in LA? Doesn't indicate much to me. Impressive find though. If nothing else, /pol/ has dedication.
picture [4]: Same as above. I agree the photo is strange. "They aren't really students" is hardly the best explanation though.
You say these kids "aren’t students, they are people hired by CNN". This seems like something that would be easily verifiable by checking the school's enrollment records. Would you agree that this would be a pretty sound way to determine if they're actually students or not?
CNN outright making up students would be a major news story that lots of publications would love to break. Yet, Breitbart is instead running [CNN Faces Growing Criticism Over Use of ‘Traumatized’ Children to Push Anti-Gun Agenda]( There's a reason that you're only finding this information on shit-tier sources like T_D.
CNN is a liberal, anti-gun organization. These are liberal, anti-gun kids. These kids are sympathetic spokespeople for the cause, and are therefore all over CNN. CNN gets ratings, the kids get a soapbox, and both get to push the anti-gun narrative.
Remember, you said these kids "aren’t students". When it becomes apparent that this is incorrect, what you **should** do is assess how you came to believe a [conspiracy theory]( and take steps to prevent similar mistakes. What I **expect** you to do is move the goalposts to something more believable ("they are CNN actors" -&gt; "they are students paid by CNN" -&gt; "they are students told what to say by CNN") and convince yourself that that's what you believed all along.

different terms mean different things to different people, but for me: i support a regulated, semi-redistributive global market economy. 
market economy: i think free markets are usually the best way to allocate resources
regulated: free markets are a useful tool, not a religion. sometimes the government has to set some additional rules. regulation of monopolies, setting environmental standards, &amp; imposing carbon taxes are all examples of this.
semi-redistributive: i think that communism doesn't work, and isn't desirable anyway. but i also i also think that wealth is not distributed fairly in a totally laissez-faire taxation system. i support using a bit of progressive taxation to create systems like universal healthcare.
global: i don't think anyone is better or worse merely on account of which country they were born in, and the 'global' part mostly follows from that.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:34:43
why can't someone just believe that making illegal transactions easier is bad? why does it have to be some illuminati globalist shit?
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:53:27
straw man. there are tons of illegal txns without CCs, but CCs make some kinds of illegal txns easier. example: why did wannacry ask for btc, not mailed usd?
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:38:06
that's true, but you don't get any information about who the entities are. and even transaction visibility will largely go away once LN is adopted.
IANA law enforcement person, but i expect the paper trail to be easier to follow for traditional banking, at least if the crime stays within the US.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:41:42
"most murderers use X, we should ban X" is not the way i think about it. it's more like, "does X make murders happen more?"
i'm not arguing for banning anything FWIW. just that CCs have made some kinds of illegal txns easier
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:28:35

not sure what your point is. i'm basically a globalist, fwiw.
regarding population, the issue solves itself since it seems that population growth tapers off in developed countries, and i think that's a good thing. not sure how that's related though.
