I had a friend do the same thing with **Augur** because he thought it "looked cool".
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:15:56
Well, that's certainly true.
I love to see things like this. I've heard 3 separate bitcoin conversations at work (unrelated to me, of  course) just this week.
Actually had to jump in to advise my manager quietly after another employee told him Bitcoin Cash was a good buy  a bit ago.
Bitcoin is becoming much more known.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:10:55
That's really cool. And smart.
A great way of showing kids how big the world is.

If I had the private key to ANY btc wallet I could import that account into any wallet of my choosing. Many wallets allow the user to spend 0 confirmation funds.
I've had to do this myself when a transaction was sent to me with too low of fees. I initiate a CPFP transaction and both transactions confirm in the same block.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:35:22
It's a worthwhile investment.
I'm very new to this and don't have much money in btc. But I have a hardware wallet to store it on. I have the Ledger Nano S and it's been great. 
I want my money safe and there's nothing safer than an offline hardware wallet for btc.
Use it once and you'll see how valuable it is. Read some of the horror stories of people on this very subreddit who lost all their BTC that they kept on an exchange/hot wallet.
It's worth it.

You do have a much better grasp of these concepts than most, I will say.
You also are exercising caution.
I wish you the best!
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:37:32
Absolutely agree.
I thank all the subreddit members who shared their mistakes with us to learn from.
The hardware wallet gives me a lot of peace of mind. Not connected to the internet at all. Feels good, man.
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:20:11
Your account was obviously compromised and the attacker used a bot to transfer your money.
I don't know the ins and outs but basically software was programmed to IMMEDIATELY transfer any incoming deposits. Within *seconds.*
30 seconds after your transaction went through, it was sent out. Definitely a bot. 
I can send "pending" funds from my wallet with 0 confirmations. That's likely what happened.
I'm so sorry you lost your funds. Regardless of how it happened, you're out a good amount of cash/btc and I feel for you.
Treat your crypto wallet info like TOP SECRET nuclear launch codes from here on out. A hardware wallet bought directly from the manufacturer should be your next purchase.
This person that stole your funds has deposited over $20,000 into one address alone. What a scumbag. He or she will get what they deserve eventually.
EDIT: The hacker that stole your money stole from many others and all were from legacy wallets. Most likely all blockchain.com wallets, I'd bet.
@_date: 2019-06-11 13:14:24

As long as your phone is unrooted (meaning you haven't modified the operating system, you would know if you did) an Android wallet has less vulnerability than a desktop wallet.
I'd say $500 or less, Mycelium (but save your 24 word seed!)
$500 or more, hardware wallet Trezor or Ledger  Nano S

I'm not talking about buying and selling. I'm talking storage. 
It's pretty safe with Coinbase *as an exchange*, the issue is on people getting access to your accounts.
Once you buy the bitcoin, it should be moved off COINBASE. 
There are lots of ways people could access your accounts and quickly drain your balance. It's happened to people here. 
Hackers port the users cell phone number for 2 factor authentication and drained their accounts. 
There's a common saying here, *not your key, not your coin*. It means that if you don't hold the private key (you don't have a key on COINBASE) you don't really have control of your bitcoin. 
What if it's something as simple as Coinbase goes down for a couple days when you need access to your coin?
Don't rely on a website with poor customer support to keep your money safe long-term. Well, I wouldn't.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:24:26
We have a winner!
Obligatory r/theydidthemath, of course.
People act like owning $1000 of bitcoin will make them millions. Sure I would love that too but that's not realistic.
Thanks for breaking it down.

If Bitcoin price is holding steady at these levels, I imagine it will be much higher once it becomes more widely known and adopted.
That's a good sign to me for a long-term investment. 
All you day traders have a lot of cojones to try to play this game on a daily basis, I give you a lot of credit. I don't know what the hell is going to happen day to day.

Of course, what is the likelihood of bitcoin reaching 10,000,000 per btc?
Believe me, I hope it does go that high!

Ok, there are some others that could give the best recommendations for Apple wallets but I have Mycelium for Android and it's fantastic.
Are your plans to hold for a longer period of time?
If so (or you have a significant amount invested), a hardware wallet would be your most secure option.
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:01:33
No, it's 9k!
...and it's gone
EDIT: And it's back!
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:28:31
Mycelium is WAY better than keeping coin on COINBASE.
With that said, a hardware wallet is WAY better than Mycelium.
Definitely move to Mycelium and get it off COINBASE.

The sidebar has tons of resources.
Read "The Bitcoin Standard" book. It really explains currency and the relation to crypto currency well.
Search by top all time on the r/bitcoin subreddit and find some good posts to read up on and learn about bitcoin.
It will serve you well to understand the importance of cryotocurrencies and the technology behind it.

Yeah that was a crazy 12 seconds last time!

I feel BTC is the gold standard.
With that being said, if you aren't totally sure, put 3-10% in some alt coins you've researched and like.
I personally think Litecoin, Ethereum, and XRP have a lot of potential but I don't *trust* them like I trust BTC. 
I personally hold 97% BTC and 3% alt coins.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:24:12
Honestly, and I mean no disrespect to those who have, but you have to be an idiot to lose your key.
Do whatever feels most comfortable to you of course. 
It's literally 24 English words in a particular order. That's it. It is very easy to keep. Not to mention, you only need them if your wallet gets lost or corrupted.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:21:08
Well said.
Also I look at it like this.
A person running Linux is likely to be pretty sharp with technology and will know how to protect themselves.

@_date: 2019-06-28 14:18:10
Excellent question! It's very smart of you to think about scenarios like that. 
Yes, you can restore your coins to any wallet. 
Your bitcoin is stored on the blockchain and has nothing to do with the wallet.
Your backup seed can be used in any other wallet you'd like. That's your ticket. 
In fact, you could have the same wallet on 2 devices if you wanted. 
This keeps your coin safe but comes with some responsibility. That 12 or 24 word seed IS THE KEY TO YOUR BITCOIN. 
A user yesterday entered his hardware wallet seed words into a website (don't ever do this) which was a scam and his hardware wallet was drained completely. He was confused since no one had access to his physical wallet. 
Those words can be used by anyone, anywhere to restore a wallet and have 100% control of the funds. 
So keep your words VERY SAFE. Never enter them on any computer for any reason. Keep a paper copy in more than 1 secure physical location. 
It's terrible watching people lose money and bitcoin really isn't too hard to navigate if you do your homework. 
I'm an old man when it comes to technology (grew up with cassettes and no computers) but I absolutely understand bitcoin security.
Keep asking questions and keep your bitcoin safe ! =)

Good advice. I use SwiftKey, which has a pretty good reputation and works well.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:13:34
Good question.
There are others much more versed in this than I that can explain it better, hopefully they'll chime in.
For an extremely basic explanation, here we go.
Windows PCs are vulnerable to viruses, malware, etc.
Android and Apple devices (provided they aren't rooted or operating system modified) are relatively safe from these.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:25:18

@_date: 2019-06-27 17:28:35
My personal opinion is BTC is king.
In my opinion, long-term investment in BTC has the best value of stability/profit.
Is there a chance some alt coins could make some huge gains percentage wise, outpacing BTC in the short term? Sure. There's a lot of alt coins out there and you have to guess on the right one.
To me, Bitcoin is digital gold. It has an established value and is secure.
Altcoins are rare earth metals. Some may be extremely valuable, some may have no use whatsoever.

As an example, I'll compare myself with the younger generation during something as casual as a smoke break at work or buying rounds of drinks. 
My generation would step outside and light a cigarette. 
Every single millennial I work with that smokes uses an electronic cigarette. Every one. I asked around one day when it was slow.
Just like you'd ask someone to borrow their lighter, they borrow USB cables.
When I used to go out drinking back in my Navy days, we would all chip in cash to pay the tab. If you borrowed money, you paid them back in cash.
Nowadays, most millennials carry cards only and to pay another for drinks, Venmo or Cash App is used to digitally transfer funds back to your buddies. 
Our whole world is turning digital.
That's why I'm investing in "digital gold", Bitcoin.

There's a big difference between learning about a new business idea or investment versus seeing a creation that will vastly change daily life for billions around the world.
I was a young kid back then and I totally got it. I understood. Money invested back then would have paid off greatly. I'm trying to not make that same mistake now with BTC. 
I told my Dad to invest in the internet. Offered to make a website for his business. He didn't see it. I watched his business decline in the automotive industry in Detroit and he just didn't believe in change.
No one can see the future but the writing is on the wall, I think.

I think it has a lot of room to grow in both price and mainstream acceptance.
We've got the block reward being halved next year which I feel will be a great event for the price of bitcoin.
I feel that cryotocurrencies are here to stay. Most of the alt coins won't make it but I think a few will rise to the top of the heap and remain successful long-term just like I think bitcoin will. 
That's just my 2 cents, it'll be fun to see what the next 5 years holds for BTC.
*HODL ON, MY FRIENDS.*

That's absolutely how it was!
Imagine everyone thinking of the whole internet as if it was 4chan.
Not the greatest reputation.
On the other hand, it was A LOT of fun. It was pretty wide open to do whatever you wanted. It was actually more of a community.

I am relatively new to this so take this with a grain of salt.
Bitcoin is the "gold standard". The smaller cryotocurrencies are rare earth metals that we may or may not have a use for. The alt coins could be very valuable or almost worthless.
Bitcoin, however, will last as a store of value much like gold.

Yes, very new.
When I made the decision to invest in bitcoin, it was for a long-term investment.
I feel bitcoin is going to rise in price significantly in the next 5-10 years. I also feel that it is a good store of value at the price I paid for my bitcoin. I have faith in the bitcoin network and I see bitcoin as the gold standard among cryotocurrency.
I was around during the early days of the internet. Connecting to local bulletin boards (or pay long distance to connect to exotic far away boards) via dial up 2400k modem. I had a free unlimited America Online account for being a Beta tester and remember telling older family members that websites would replace 1-800 numbers on the bottom of the  screen at the end of commercials and the general response I got was "Oh, that's just for computer nerds" and widespread adoption would never happen.
I was extremely young at the time and felt that the internet was going to change how we live life on a daily basis.
And look where we are now. Billions of people are connected via the internet with computers in their pocket 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
I felt so strongly about that and that's how I feel about bitcoin. 
I've learned in my life to trust true gut instincts. I hope I'm correct.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:12:44
I very much appreciated seeing yesterday's rise in price and market cap as I toiled away at a job I don't like.
