I don't think indiegogo works like that. Only Kickstarter requires you to meet the goal. Am I wrong on this?

This is idiotic. All you did was pick two vastly different time frames that look similar. I could do this with virtually any chart on anything.

I went through Bitcoined previous post history. I find some of his past posts very telling. Here is a post from 4 months ago in "I have seen you make a similar post within at least once before. Apple products are luxury goods for individuals with high incomes. $1800 is not a lot of money to many of us. Whether I buy a $500 laptop, a $1800 laptop, or a $5000 laptop makes no difference to me financially.
If this is a testament to how you spend your time there is no need to wonder why you are poor. You too probably do not understand why someone would buy a luxury car, clothing, or home. You lack sophistication and culture so you rage with jealousy and envy on the internet about things you don't understand."

I'm in Mechanicsburg! Looks like I'll be making some trips across the Susquehanna soon.

You sir, are a scum bag. You will reap what you sow.

So going above and beyond what is required warrants a zero? Flawless logic.

Hey OP, I also went to a cyber school and graduated in 2011. I highly suggest that you have your parents contact the school counselor and explain the situation. The teacher sounds unreasonably condescending to say the least... Make sure your parents forward the comments that your teacher made about the paper and the paper itself to your counselor.
