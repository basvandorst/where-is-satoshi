You're welcome :)

I think you are right. For small files and lower bitrates, FSK modulation (something like [Bell 103]( should be easier to decode than QAM. 
However, Armory wallet may need to transfer large files [once in a while]( thus I've implemented 64-QAM OFDM modem.

The data transmitted is the bitcoin transaction, before and after the signature - which are public information by the protocol design. The only thing that has to be kept private is the private key, which is not transmitted anywhere.

Many cloud providers, including AWS, allow you to choose the location of the data center, where you would like to deploy your instances.

Bitcointalk thread: 
I would be happy if more people will try and test this library.
Questions, remarks and suggestions are welcome!
@_date: 2014-08-02 08:52:53
You are right, but this would require simulatenous bi-directional connection between the online and the offline computers, requiring two audio cables.
Since I have got only one audio cable, I am calibrating the sender manually. :)
@_date: 2014-07-26 15:37:52
Thanks ☺
@_date: 2014-07-26 15:40:50
How much storage do they offer?
@_date: 2014-08-02 08:15:29
I am working on an air-gapped communication solution for transaction signing between an online and an offline computers. Something like the Trezor, but with regular PC/laptop with an audio interface, instead of specific USB device.
I think that the guys at [BitKey]( project may help a lot by integrating this package into their great distro.
If there will be demand, I can profile and optimize the modem to run on a Raspberry Pi.

The cheapest deal I could find on their site is $20/month :(
@_date: 2014-08-02 10:30:33
The bitrate depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver.
Using an audio cable between the two computers results in very low noise, and very low signal distortion - allowing 48kbps bit rate.
I've used also a simple headset, with its microphone as the receiver and the speaker as the transmitter, and the SNR allowed only ~8kpbs to be transferred reliably.
Also, I am using naive Reed-Solomon (255,245) error correction code, so it can fix up to 5 errors in a frame of 255 bytes.

chirp.io is pretty cool, but it works only for sharing small amounts of data. See  for more details:

Found it [here](
There are too many full nodes :)

I can also recommend my audio modem implementation (in Python):

See my reply above: 
@_date: 2014-07-26 10:08:18
I am not saying that AWS is the best solution, but if someone is already signing up to AWS, he can start running a full node for a few $.
If you are aware of other cloud/VPS providers having an offer for running full node - I would be happy to hear :)
@_date: 2014-08-02 11:07:12
Thanks :)

Yes, it is inherently harder to verify that the Bluetooth stack is secure.
Also, not every computer has Bluetooth...
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:42:47
Great idea! 
BTW, I am working on a audio MODEM library that may be of use for your project:

I can recommend using  for air-gapped transaction signing.
I hope to integrate this feature in popular Bitcoin wallets.

You can use an audio modem for air-gapped communication: 
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:30:11
Electrum now has an audio modem plugin you can use for air-gapped communication.

AFAIU, Electrum Personal Server works best a single (static) Electrum wallet - requiring almost no additional resources (except those used by bitcoind, which can be pruned).
However, in case you'd like to add/change a wallet - it requires a blockchain rescan [1], so it's harder to use it with multiple/dynamic Electrum wallets.
Please see [2] for more details.
On my machine (after the initial sync is over), `electrs` takes ~600MB of RAM (mostly RocksDB cache and mempool transactions) and consumes &lt;1% CPU - so it shouldn't be too hard to run it (in addition to a full bitcoind node).

Good point :)
This project builds an "external" txindex (similar to  so you don't need to enable the "internal" one (i.e. using the `-txindex` Bitcoin Core flag).
@_date: 2015-04-26 05:14:59
Make sure that you backup your Electrum's seed, to be able to restore your wallet even if your computer fails.
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:49:00
AFAIK it should use less resources (CPU, RAM, disk) than ElectrumX, due to the rewrite in Rust and not requiring `-txindex` (~16GB, as of last month).
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:58:21


Around 20% of the space used by the indexed bitcoin blocks:
$ du -sh ~/.bitcoin/blocks/
186G	/home/roman/.bitcoin/blocks/
$ du -sh ./db/mainnet/
37G	./db/mainnet/


Thanks, great to hear :)
Please let me know if there's something I can help you with!
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:41:52
This should probably do the job:
$ electrum  --oneserver --server=${ELECTRUM_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS}:${PORT}:t
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:22:47
I was learning Rust, and wanted to contribute back to the Electrum community :)
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:21:49


Thanks :)


This Electrum server assumes that the bitcoind runs on the same machine (mainly for file access), so if you want to run bitcoind on a separate machine, please map its data directory (e.g. via SSHFS).

You're welcome :)


If the node is already indexed, it may retrieve the actual transactions' contents a bit faster from the disk when a Electrum client is requesting them (since txindex maps each TXID to its file and offset on disk).
However, on HDDs the seek time would probably dominate the read/parse time, so I guess the performance improvement won't be significant.
Note also that on subsequent requests the tranasaction will be cached, so the HDD latency won't impact the client.

Hello all,
I was working on this project for the last few months, so a user could run his own Electrum server, with required hardware resources not much beyond those of a full node (using ideas from ElectrumX [1], Electrum Personal Server [2] and bitcoincore-indexd [3]).
The code and usage instructions can be found here:
The server indexes the entire Bitcoin blockchain, and the resulting index [4] enables fast queries for any given user wallet, allowing the user to keep real-time track of his balances and his transaction history using the Electrum wallet [5].
Since it runs on the user's own machine, there is no need for the wallet to communicate with external Electrum servers, thus preserving the privacy of the user's addresses and balances.
 * Supports latest Electrum protocol [6].
 * Maintains an index of transaction inputs and outputs, allowing fast balance queries
 * Fast synchronization of the Bitcoin blockchain (~2.5 hours for ~185GB @ June 2018) on modest hardware [7]
 * Low CPU &amp; memory usage (after initial indexing)
 * Low index storage overhead (~20%), relying on a local full node for transaction retrieval
 * Efficient mempool tracker allowing better fee estimation [8].
 * `-txindex` is not required for the Bitcoin node
 * Uses `rust-bitcoin` library [9] for efficient serialization/deserialization of Bitcoin transactions
 * Uses a single RocksDB [10] database, for better consistency and crash recovery
Hope you'll find it useful :)

Sorry, you're right - it's needed only for the for the historical queries (e.g. to see your outgoing transactions).
Also (AFAIK) there is no support for UTXO indexing today at Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2018-07-05 04:53:31
It support `balance` queries by adding TxIn/TxOut indices - which are currently not supported by bitcoind and bicoincore-indexd.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:01:55
 can also be useful :)

Electrum 2.0+ also has an Audio MODEM plugin, to transfer the unsigned and signed transactions "over the air".
