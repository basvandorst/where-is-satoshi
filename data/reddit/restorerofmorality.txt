A firm I invested in went bankrupt and is not returning money owed to its clients, therefore money is a scam.

Perhaps the reasons the forks are occurring should be addressed.

It's more than some if a hard fork occurs. Dismissing them all as idiots isn't going to help prevent another from occurring.

They also ran the unverified Russia dossier along with Buzzfeed that was never proven to be authentic, and they never apologized or retracted. 
Anchorwoman [crying]( over his election - fine with me she isn't happy, no it's not outright lying, but that shit ain't impartial or professional reporting.
They also do the exact same thing Fox does, cutting mics and dropping feeds when something doesn't go their way:
