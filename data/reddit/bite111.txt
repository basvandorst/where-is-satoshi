This will be investigated by the police. The childish approach taken by Danny "what actually happened is what I say it happened" does not work with the police and the courts. He has a LOT to explain and for his own good he better be prepared to account with full supporting information for every single transaction and every single coin he took from investors. 


You will be very surprised. Just wait until he is taken to custody.

Tuur, I congratulate you for admitting your mistake.

No this is not a "take the loss and move on".
He should not escape unpunished.

News come to light, showing that Brewster has a history of defrauding people, getting their money and running away.

He will be hiding and watching over his shoulder for the rest of his life?
What kind of life is this?
Better for him to settle his obligations, face the law for any criminal actions and get his life back.

When asked about the problems, Mr Brewster said: "The caterers and the seven people who purchased tickets did not enter into a contract with me as a person or send me any money, they entered into a contract with Future Entertainment Ltd which is now a failed business and a separate legal entity."
**When asked about the thousands of bitcoins "unaccounted for" in Neo &amp; Bee Mr Brester said:"The shareholders who gave their coins and the creditors who supplied goods and services to Neo &amp; Bee Ltd did not enter into a contract with me as a person or send me any money, they entered into a contract with Neo &amp; Bee Ltd which is now a failed business and a separate legal entity."**

The cops have done an excellent job.
If they manage to catch him, they will become stars in the bitcoin community.

Yes, he is innocent until proven guilty. Can he prove he is innocent though? Because the court decided that "prima facie there is a strong case against him and he should be arrested and brought to custody to prove his innocense".

Danny can mention these to the police when he will be trying to explain exactly what happened. Guess he will need a dozen forensic accountants to help him.
