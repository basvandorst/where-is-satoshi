Fair enough. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:55:56
Interesting idea, but I disagree. The people who get interested enough to want to get their first small amount of BTC should be incentivized to spend at least $20 on it. 
People who are just getting it to learn, for fun, or who figure they may as well have a tiny bit in case it shoots up to 1m/btc, probably won't bother with the $20 if then can get 5 cents worth for free.
It can't be cheap to rent that space, the operators have to make a little money or that nice Bitcoin ad will say Subway in a year!

Because this is a marketing campaign.
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:39:57
I hear that all the time, but that is what almost everyone does and obviously it doesn't prevent losses. 
Plus those who use these accounts to trade for profit have to leave money there.

Another thing: Bitcoin/fiat exchange rates have never been so stable for such a long time.
Sure, this doesn't help those who bought in at $1000 and hoped to get rich quick, but it has certainly made using it for trade more simple.
@_date: 2015-06-14 12:09:02


um I thought we all hated it when states and countries tried to regulate bitcoin exchanges? Now we shouldn't use ones that aren't regulated? My brain hurts.
@_date: 2015-06-14 12:11:23


Go for it. If I recall correctly, this worked amazingly with mtgox. Free market in action!
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:37:45
Yes, a global currency that is impossible to trade in amounts over 20k is really helpful! Good call.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:01:12
So basically, we created this currency to get around banks and wall street, but now we want them to buy up a ton of coins to we'll get rich?
Gotcha 
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:19:51
That's what I was thinking. Most of the shops you were describing just added it to get some traffic and some sales from bitcoin holders.
I can't think of a single larger site that stopped accepting it.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:30:10
You had to pay a fine regarding your exchanges, right? Maybe it has something to do with that. Is anything about your exchange unresolved with relation to the US gov?
PS btc-tc and your litecoin exchange were awesome in their day.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:54:48
Sorry to hear that mate, and thanks for explaining what happened. 
Best of luck getting your $ back from bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:51:02
I guess that would be a cool feature, but really is it that hard to manually withdraw the change?
I agree that it should give you a set amount of USD and then tell you exactly how much BTC to spend. Other machines I have seen do exactly that.
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:33:47
Aaaaaaaaaand this is the reason I encrypt and store my passwords myself. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:40:11
ah, thanks! Now I get it.
@_date: 2015-06-02 14:15:19
I mean that the private key has never been entered into/used with any bitcoin software or website that has ever touched the internet. 
Cold wallets.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:43:43
yup you are totally right! I apologize it my comment came off as trying to justify bitstamp's behavior, I didn't mean it that way. 
This was definitely terrible service and a good reason to avoid this company. burnside is legit, I totally believe his account of this situation.
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:38:47
Yes but sadly we live in the real world and not some make believe fantasy world that sounds perfect when you're drunk.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:44:06
Bitcoin isn't anonymous by default, whether you use new addresses every time or not.
It is safer to use a unique address every time. Why not store all Bitcoins on addresses whose private keys have never been online, until the moment you are going to spend them?
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:02:33
...not to mention the family billions. They are going to be just fine.
@_date: 2015-05-10 09:16:39
My question is who in the fuck is paying 9 cents for paycoins?
@_date: 2015-05-16 16:39:19
No. If he were, why wouldn't any of the hundreds of alt-coin creators have faced similar problems?
As others have mentioned, he would face an unbelievable amount of harassment and personal danger (everyone on earth knows he potentially holds billions worth of bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-05-16 17:07:27
They have to exchange their Bitcoins for cash or goods somewhere. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 06:22:10
Same here. Also: taxi drivers.

Best news program in America! I will finally be donating to them, it's long overdue. Been a fan since they were a radio stream.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:51:35


Seriously? OP mentioned 9 and I can think of at least a couple more. 
The supply is decreasing and the demand will almost certainly continue to increase. 
I am not a mathamagician but people smarter than I have concluded that what happens in this case is so well proven that they call it a science and teach it in schools.  ;-)
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:35:13
Yes, big time. They were the probably the most trustworthy Bitcoin exchange of all time. They traded over 100 million CAD in about three years, and I don't remember seeing anyone complain about anything legitimate. At least 1m of those trades were mine, and they processed my withdrawals every day like clockwork. 
Even when they got hacked and shut down, all users got 100% of their funds.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:45:14
Your point is generally correct, however


See: Nearly every major company in the industry has lost coins to security flaws.


Whether we use Bitcoin or not, we still have governments that require us to do things like pay taxes and record our stock trades.
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:54:39
You kids are nuts, or just have no understanding of the world you live in. This money was spent to become a compliant money service business, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin specifically. 
We have laws and regulations surrounding money laundering for a reason, and it is not because tha socialist nazis want to take away muh freedom.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:03:12
Ah ha, so I'm not the only one who was thinking it.
