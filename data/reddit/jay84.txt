You don't get it do you? :) Why would anyone need some bank to "add one more currency" when we have a blockchain? There is no need for middleman. 
Today banks have monopol on payment system. We need them to faciliate our payments. That may change in the future and if it does, that is pretty much the end of current fractional reserve banking model.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:39:06
No, this has nothing to do with free market. There is no free market when it comes to lending and money. There is only very much distorted and extremely centralized market. That's why we have CENTRAL banks. They are into CENTRAL planning via interest rate manipulation.  You just showed, you have no idea how interest rates affect asset prices btw. That's why you dont understand why are house prices so much higher today than if true free market would be at place. 
Still, this housing discussion is completely OT. Nobody disputes need for lending. All I am saying, again, is that with decentralized money, you'll get much more decentralized banking sector (than we have today) which is, again, absolute nightmare for todays banksters.

@_date: 2014-02-13 09:18:27
And why most people can't afford house without a loan? Maybe because of current banking system, where central bankers for thirty years by printing money lower long-term interest rates, pushing asset prices higher so people need to take more debt?
You are funny :) I am not saying there will be no more loans. I am saying that BTC is threatening current too big to fail banks by opening up space for competitors which is absolute nightmare for current banksters.

Oh god, you must be joking. I am not here to teach you how banking works. My last comment, I have no time for this. 
Banks get money essentially for FREE today. They borrow from central bank at 0 % or collect deposit at 0 % as well. They have these deposit becouse of their monopol on payment system. 
Then they loan those funds for some 4 pct at 30yr mortgage. Nobody, except for banks, can get money that cheap, therefore they are the most profitable. 
They just take some collateral, say 10 000 USD, against that sum borrow at 0 % some 90 000 USD and lend 100 000 USD. There is no fucking way anyone, even your rich guy, could lend 100 000 USD under these terms and be so profitable.

Thanks for reply. I would definitely not. But when difficulty increase slowly, life span of my mining gear would be longer. I would still be mining with some pool. But thanks to lower difficulty increase, my profitability with large pool (say 30% of total hash rate) would be almost the same as if mining with small pool (2 % of total hash rate)... or not? :)
Maybe I've asked wrong question. Isn't lower variance of large pool over small pool problem only when hash rate rises rapidly?

Yeah, sorry. It's basically very popular delivery service with more than 90 000 customers in Czech republic. They just enabled this today. The other options are credit card, wire transfer and cash on delivery. If you want to pay with bitcoin, you need to buy credit first. One credit is one czech koruna (CZK), currently some 0.00006115 btc. And with the credit, you may buy whatever you want :)
Tweet says: You may buy food with bitcoin now!
edit: They use BitPay
edit2: This is how the payment site looks:  Three alternatives: credit card (instant), wire transfer (2-3 day) Bitcoin (instant). Minimum is 100 credits/0.006115. You may buy ordinary food with some 200 credits easily. Then just scan QR and boom...

Crypto, I think, you're doing great job. I wish for more entrepreneurs with your drive and skills. I really hope, it will work. My fear is however, for this kind of business, BTC is still too young. Your revenue stream is and will be negligible for a long time in comparison to your BTC reserves. You must know that. To me, your company is leveraged play on further BTC rise. I am fine with leverage. But not when other people's money are on the table.
