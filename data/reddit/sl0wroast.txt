For a low risk investment yes. But the performance of tech stocks for the last 5 years is way above that.
However the point is that 8% is no where near 'phenomenal'

More sellers than buyers 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:26:04
Yes exactly. However I see cryptocurrencies investing most similar to tech stock investing. Therefore it is  decent proxy to compare anual returns.

This is the real prediction. Quoted from article:

dankest shit*
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:38:57
but is depositing btc on a darknet site illegal?
If they had bought illegal stuff online they wouldn't of had to coins to be stolen ;)
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:58:29
pretty sure its not :)
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:34:54
8% a year is phenomenal? No. You could of invested in the Nasdax and had 35% gains last year.

Be appalled 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:26:22
Exactly, so miners decisions about wether to hold or not has a big impact on buy / sell demand and price 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:30:25
Electricity bills are generally invoiced monthly. Businesses also have working capital. It is completely possible for these operations to hold off payments for significant amounts of time. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:02:17
Circulating supply is irrelevant, it's amount of selling volume which determines price. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 09:50:48
So previously it was illegal to pay salaries in BTC or there was just no tax to be paid on it?
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:40:43
Becuase if your paying for stuff in fiat, e.g pizza, then you want that money back in fiat.
This idea is great in principle but until we can pay for everyday expenses in btc we will always need some fiat 
@_date: 2019-08-17 08:10:43

A new book from Andreas Anonopolos about the lightning network
@_date: 2019-08-27 09:21:25
The block reward is the 'Coinbase transaction'. It is a UTXO (unspent output) that has no input and is included by a miner in the block he broadcasts.
The fee paid to a miner is the 'change', or net of inputs /outputs. Which is a UXTO paid to the miner with any leftover inputs from the transactions included in a block.
Hope that answers your Q. Tl'dr they are totally seperate.
Edit: if you Q is about the small reward, and the fee required for paying that reward, then this is not an issue. This is no fee needed to pay this reward (or any transaction theoretically)

Florida Court is calling him a liar. I think he is in contempt of court.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:55:07
Yes there is some truth here. But in terms of BTC supply from mining: miners will be less likely to immediately sell mined coins if price is below profitability, reducing supply and therefore creating upward price pressure 
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:30:31
Yes, once again - Bitcoin is not illegal in VN. Possesion / buying / selling is legal. Paying for good and services with bitcoin (this also includes anything that is not VND e.g USD) is banned.

Yes but a merchant wouldn't usually say that.
'Cash or card?' could be the equivalent of 'cash or bitcoin?'

@_date: 2018-11-18 16:08:18
Yes it is backed physically (otherwise they could never honour the contact) but is is not physically settled. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:55:41
Yep but here's another... Until the next last one 
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:46:07
Tbh this is not a conspiracy. This exact method was / is used in the stock market and detailed in this book:
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is a 1923 roman à clef by American author Edwin Lefèvre which is the thinly disguised biography of Jesse Lauriston Livermore.

It's movement of hashpower from BTC to BCH 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:41:46
Yes it's like owning the key, not the house. But it is not like renting. If you where renting you would not own the key. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:41:56
That would of cost you USD also ;) 
@_date: 2019-01-01 18:10:37
I think you will find the housing issue is becuase of price inflation, not ease of credit. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:04:29
Right. Who could of predicted this last 6 months or movement... 
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:08:17
Yes nicely explained. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 08:15:46
My point is the UTXO's are equivalent to the house in your analogy. You don't own these, only the keys to spend them. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:03:27
OK, as in the other comments mentioned, it could be achieved using futures contracts etc.
My point is that they have to hedge any contract they sell (physically or with a derivative) otherwise they would not be able to honour the contract when it is settled as any change of price would basically make them loose money (they just want to make the commission)
Additionally even if they achieve this with a derivative, ultimately the derivative needs btc to hedge it
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:54:42
I'm not sure what your trying to say here. He asked which coins have died, I gave him an easy way to find them himself. But on the subject, BTC has outperformed almost all of them.

Weiss ratings (the agency cited by OP) is the most scammy 'rating agencies' there is. Their sales emails are a joke and there coin ratings in 2018 where ridiculous.

Speak for yourself, I plan to be in my prime 
@_date: 2019-01-01 07:39:16
Actually this isn't even true, bitcoins don't 'move' to addresses.
The point OP is making is actually correct. No one owns bitcoins, simply you may have the correct key to allow 'spending' of UTXO's.
I suppose its a bit like having custody of those bitcoin you 'own'. Anyone that has the right key for the right UTXO's can transfer custody to someone else, who's private key is then required to transfer custody again.
Of course there is a lot of semantics and ownership /custody could be used interchangeably. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:21:24
Tl;dr buy low, not high 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:00:12

@_date: 2019-01-04 02:11:42
As long as bitcoin remains primarily a speculative asset, a stock market sell-off will almost certainly reduce capital inflow to bitcoin. It creates  a 'risk-off' climate and currently bitcoin is risky. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:36:38
Don't worry. There's still quite a fews days until that happens. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 08:03:29
If you understand UXTO's you will understand why this is not true. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:51:35
This % will related to their risk appetite. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:59:56
Based on price action today, I'm guessing yes... 
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:09:28
It could be less than 0.1%

@_date: 2018-11-19 01:16:19
Backed physically = when someone purchases the  derivative, the issuer would buy the underlying asset to hedge any exposure to price change
Physically settled = on contract expiry, the contract owner receives the underlying asset.
The other option to physically settled is cash settled where, when the contract expires, the difference between the contract price and underlying price is paid as a cash amount.
