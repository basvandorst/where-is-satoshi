True and I am not saying thay won't buy in at 100,000. But if you think it has to go to 200,000 to double your money.  Ps this is why I posted this on Reddit.  To have a adult conversation. :-)

I have made way more money in alt than I ever had in btc and I can't see that changing . I invest with my head not my heart and it allways works. When you say I don't know what I am talking about i say my bank account would disagree with you . :-)

I hear ya . When people talk about bitcoin on tv etc. Thay should know what thay are talking about.  These people clearly have no idea what thay are saying . Thay are just saying bs. For people who do know bitcoin.  This is just insulting to hear people talk like this when thay now other people believe them.

This is called the Hakka . It is part of the Maori culture in New Zealand.  You can see the all blacks ruby team doing it befor evey game. The Maori people are one of the nicest people you've ever come across. Seen the hakka with your own two eyes is an amazing thing.  Hats off to the Maori to be able to keep the culture intact in the modern world.

I hear what you are saying but you would think that people hosting a news show would have just a bit of understanding of what thay are talking about.  These clearly have no idea . The question that are asking are just nonsense. When it comes to bitcoin.   News  outlets around the world tell you facts and know what thay are saying with legitimate question. Then you have the American news.  My God thay have no idea.  It's like watching a blind man pick out his favourite porno. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:08:51
If this is how people get there news about BTC then that are been purposely Mislead by people who have no idea what thay are talking about. Seen so may things  CNBC news says and thay have no idea .thay are trying to scare people away.  Are  CNBC owned by the banks ? Because none can be this stupid .

Hahaha so so true more people sell the more I am buying  .  In the end I know it will pay off in a few years :-)
