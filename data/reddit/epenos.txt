Its no prophecy, its my opinion based on a few fundamentals. I will make sure to start my post next time with; "imho.."
Deleting this would make no sense, as it would leave no room for discussion

30-40% drop is more likely, but only after the momentum of reaching an extrordinary ATH. This is not that moment, but I agree with you that it could be short term, very possibly after the fork and reaching some $6500+ area.
Previous ATH however, is mostly considered to be the next support. That would be $5k

Transaction fees
Assuming there will not be an adjustment to the protocol:
Miners base their incentive on block rewards and less on transaction fees. In two decades time however one could assume that the development of processor chips for mining progresses and leads to become small and cheap, able to run on e.g. your phone/laptop and just be a background process. So the contraction of miners will be balanced out, and energy saving on mining hardware may make it profitable on the transaction fees.
With blockchain new market appear, NVIDIA and AMD now have new product lines focussed on mining, and take a look at community mining via multi-relational networks

If coin corrects &amp; there is bad news, people will dump
If coin corrects &amp; there is no news, people will buy the low (bounce)
