Good idea going short yesterday, you probably earned a lot of... wait, never mind.

You talk as if 1 BTC being removed from circulation is some sort of unprecedented event. Bitcoins are disappearing into oblivion daily and it'll keep happening due to the unrecoverable nature of BTC wallets.

Saying a puppy mill is bad (which of course they are) to educate someone is okay, calling someone an asshole for buying a puppy at a mill is not okay.

And i feel that you're an asshole for making these kinds of judgements just because you don't agree with OP's decision.
Fuck off.

I think he answered your question not guess your age

Where I'm from it was the same but in our country it had a lot to do with the dissolution of the Soviet union, I'm assuming it affected the US a lot as well to be honest.

Well, that's because you're not a moron.

It's highly profitable or highly devastating. Either way high volatility is what most traders look for to make moves. Just whatever you do, don't play with a high margin in a market like today's because that will hurt.

But they aren't letting him withdraw. That's the entire point of this post lol..

So someone that has no business in using them anyway?

Yes. And it's a great tool for markets that often are lacking in volatility (price doesn't change much percentage-wise) like Forex for example. For something like BTC, today saw a 4% rise shortly followed by a 10% drop. When you combine something like that with 100x margin it means you're looking at a 400% rise followed by a 1000% drop. You just don't have enough money to stay in the investment because the price is changing too rapidly and the exchange will force you to close your position thus losing you all of your money.
If for example you shorted BTC at 9100 today at 100x leverage using 0.1 BTC as your margin and closed the short at 8000 you could've made 1.375 BTC as a result. What's more likely though is that you short it a bit too soon and lose all of your 0.1 BTC in a matter of seconds.
