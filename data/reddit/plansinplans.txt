I don't think this list is correct because I just talked with Fidelity and was told I can buy shares with my Roth IRA account.

Wikipedia disagrees:

So we should all go post stupid shit in other subs so that the members of those subs can show everyone how we are wrong?  Your logic sucks.  You can have quality conversations that inform without making shit up.

Wikipedia disagrees because the OP said "That's where this famous word comes from." and you clearly disagreed with that statement in your reply to me by offering the Greek etymology.  So both you and wikipedia disagree with what the OP said.  I'm sure I can find other sources to disagree too.

You're right, I thought there was some flexibility there, but there isn't.  Thanks!

~~My understanding is that you can't day trade this like you can on a bitcoin exchange.  Each buy and sell of the share would be a taxable event.  You don't have a taxable event on bitcoin exchanges until you cash out.~~
  
I think I am confused about this topic and need to read up more, I will still like to know how this will be manipulated any differently than current exchanges since it doesn't make sense to me and I feel like there has to be room for arbitration and that in itself would level out the price.

You just described the system we have now.  Except the 1 elected person is the miner that completes the block.  The voting mechanism is the network agreeing on what software to run.  And the governments have a sense of control through regulation.

You are free to hack bitcoin all you want.  Libertarians believe in non-aggression towards others, so no hacking entities that use or support bitcoin.

They're not, it's clear they're just trolling now.

Can you show us how it will be highly susceptible to manipulation?  That would(?) create arbitrage opportunities.
