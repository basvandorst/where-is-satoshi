The blockchain is valuable because it provides a system of distributed trust. In a normal financial transaction, there is an entity in the middle that provides the trust (a credit card operator, say). With bitcoin, the blockchain itself (which is a ledger of all transactions) provides the trust, so value is able to be transferred autonomously. You and I are able to exchange value in bitcoin and we don't have to contact any third party, we can be located anywhere and indeed we don't even have to know who each other are. The trust lies in the encryption and the ledger itself. It's a fairly significant conceptual and organizational shift, and it (or something like it) could have applications to other things besides bitcoin.

I'm curious what the other two recent outages (before the hack, in the last 1-2 months) were related to. Bitfinex experienced downtime just a couple of days after the status page mentioned a software upgrade.
Were those outages / that software upgrade related to the hack, or did they create the conditions that allowed the hack to happen?

I see the OP's point: we've had 100+ years of people being trained to give up control of their money, to put it in a bank, because it's "safer". Now, people new to bitcoin are being told it's safer to hide their bits under their digital mattress, and these things are in conflict. Those habits aren't going to die overnight (even if they should), particularly as concerns the less tech-savvy people who start to come onboard.
Some of this debate may become moot as time goes on, though. If Bitcoin becomes big enough, there will probably start to be trading platforms that are insured up to a certain value of bitcoin stored. I think some of us who have been into it forget that we're still in the Wild West in terms of how far along bitcoin adoption is; there will be more diversified service offerings in the future, and some of them might offer better security than the ones we have now.

If they predict a crash all the time, then when a crash comes (because economies always crash at some point, or at least have setbacks), they can point to their prediction as true, even though they had dozens of wrong predictions along the way. Then they can use that to tout their "accuracy" going forward, and suck even more people into their doom and gloom vortex.
At any rate, a global pullback, or recession, or crash, will probably be good for Bitcoin value.

I get that...I mean, I agree with all of your negatives.
What I'm saying is, you (and me) have no choice. Bitcoin is neither currency or commodity. It is necessarily both, because it has a fixed number of bitcoins (this making it a value store), and it is a currency because there is an infrastructure to use it as a payment mechanism.  Expecting it to be only one or the other is therefore not logical.  
All new technologies have pros and cons, and so these are bitcoin's. As more and more cryptocoins are released, some may be used as predominantly currency, and others predominantly commodities.  The market will sort that out.  Hell, in the long run, if these negatives are too great, bitcoin might be replaced, and become a piece of historical theory in an economics textbook. But we can't make it into a currency by choice; it is what it is by design.

@_date: 2014-01-12 16:06:21
I think we have to have it both ways, because it is both things.
It is a commodity, like gold, because it has a limited supply, and therefore it will be used as a value store for people to hoard. Commodities have highly fluctuating value, because of the way they are traded.  Bitcoin has been more volatile, simply because it's a smaller market, so it reacts more violently to relatively minor volumes of trades. It will become more stable when there are more people involved in it.
However, although it will never have as stable a value as highly traded currencies, it still also functions as a currency (unlike gold, for practical purposes), because it is highly divisible, and easy to exchange for goods and services.
So in my opinion these sorts of dichotomies are false.  It is and will be a speculative investment and a currency, all at the same time.

It’s a repetition of the same chart over and over again: cryptocurrency market share over time (spoiler alert: it’s going down, which should be obvious since there are a bunch of other cryptocurrencies now that didn’t used to exist). Expecting bitcoin to retain 90%+ crypto market share forever is unrealistic; of course when there is more competition, total share of the market will drop.
I don’t think judging bitcoin’s success by its market share against other crypto is very useful, because I don’t see the various cryptocurrencies as primarily competitors. I see them as complementary. For me, metrics like total transactional value, number of users, and price of one bitcoin are far more important. And, although price has fluctuated along with several events, in general those metrics have been going up.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:43:27
XRP ain’t gonna be worth $2k anytime soon.  There are ~38 billion XRP units in total.  At a price of $2000, that would imply a market cap north of $76 TRILLION. The entire cryptocurrency market right now is only worth ~$100 billion. If Ripple accounted for 100% of that capitalization, it wouldn’t even be worth $3.00.
As for Bitcoin, its share of the total crypto market has been dropping, even though its price has been rising. This, it seems to me, is both totally expected, and totally fine. More money is moving into crypto, generally, and this is a great thing. There’s not going to be only one cryptocurrency; there are many niches and use cases to fill. The strength of Bitcoin has to do with its first mover advantage, its durability, and its price is partly a reflection of its scarcity.
I’d expect that we will end up with between 5 and 10 universally known (among the masses) cryptocurrencies, and that there will be dozens more for enthusiasts. Barring calamities like a major bug in the code, Bitcoin and Ethereum will probably be two of that 10. I think the other spots are still up for grabs.

I notice that Bitfinex, [according to their status page]( performed an upgrade of their trading platform four days ago. Then, a few days later, they have an outage. I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess these two events are related. Perhaps there was some scaling issue or other bug that their load testing failed to detect. 
Tough to know if that would cause a price movement, though, or rather if it was a symptom of the high volume that accompanied a natural market-related price movement.

IMO saying that the BTC approach to scaling is the long game, and the BCH approach is the short game is apt.
My opinion is that the BCH desire to scale up now to PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, etc., is a totally valid one, and will provide utility. It may make BCH more performant in the near-term. However, it’s also thinking small, in the sense that cryptocurrency, generally, ought to scale much further than that, and enable types of commerce that aren’t presently possible (micro-transaction-based, for example). More like millions or billions of transactions per second.
I imagine that long-term, payment processing solutions like BitPay will move toward being coin agnostic. An exchange that deals in multiple coins already, for example, could launch a payment service that accepts payment in many cryptocurrencies, giving expanded choice to the consumer. We’re just scratching the surface on all this stuff.
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:19:36
What others would you put in that category?
@_date: 2016-09-25 22:58:12
Here are my takeaways from that chart. I'll summarize in bullet points:
* The Fed was established in 1913, not 1900. Was there another reason why you're counting from 1900?
* From the period 1913-1929, recessions were not less frequent. There were six recessionary events during that 16 years, about the same as preceding periods.
* From 1929-1932, the Fed was active during the largest single recession in U.S. history. Counting the number of recessions is one thing, but what about degree of recession? The Great Depression was more important than many of these other events put together. As you can see in that chart, the Great Depression lowered the value of the stock market to a point not seen for ~30 years.
* When your economy has been decimated to that degree, the only way is up, and indeed, from the Great Depression on through 1950, the only other recession was when the country entered WWII. Of course the U.S. economy showed gains starting from such a low point.
* In 1950ish, my argument from before about competitive advantage starts to take shape.
Geopolitics and global market conditions &gt; central bank policymaking.
I think an appropriate analogy here is surfing: the global economic climate is a huge wave we are all surfing on. The Fed, and the government, can exert some control by steering the surfboard, but they're not driving the wave.

That's my opinion, personally. The concept is killer.

Governments don't have pockets. They have giant oil storage tanks. That's probably where they put their oil. Alternately, they can just leave it in the ground and extract it as necessary. My point is: government debts aren't paid for with gold, silver and Bitcoin anyway. They are paid off with generalized economic activity, which relies on a lot more than a couple of metals + some crypto. The comparison is pointless.
@_date: 2016-09-24 18:29:00
So they have a track record of making one correct prediction. That's a 100% success rate.  We had better listen to them.

Gold and silver are really nothing more than commodities, and viewed in that light, it would seem logical, then, to consider all other commodities as wealth as well and include them all on the right. (That means copper, uranium, oil, platinum, diamonds, etc.) That would create quite a different comparison.
@_date: 2016-09-14 21:02:14
Am I reading that right? There are only ~10.5 million BTC addresses?
Thinking about my own bitcoin usage patterns, I'm guessing there are 10-20 addresses that have been used linked to me or accounts I had at exchanges. Some systems appear to generate new addresses for every transaction. Let's assume the low end of that, that the average user (meaning, individual or company) has used about 10 addresses. That gives a population using bitcoin at only like 1.5 million.
According to that data, only 446,000 addresses contain $600 of value. Even if these addresses have a higher correlation to real users, which may be the case for several reasons (e.g., addresses with tiny amounts are probably more likely to be burner addresses), this means the population of users involved in bitcoin to a significant degree is very small, just a few hundred thousand or less.
Looking at the [statistics page]( at bitcoinprivacy.net, there have only been 156 million transactions ever. Considering that a "transaction" can simply mean moving sums between accounts you control, that's a much smaller amount than I would have guessed. Guess I never bothered to look at the aggregate data before.
The takeaway, if these numbers are right: *basically nobody is using bitcoin*. Even if the average user is linked to only 5 addresses, not even half of one percent of the people on Earth are active. That means the potential for upside is still rather significant if it catches fire in the mainstream.
Anyone have other sources for estimates of the total bitcoin-using population?

Getting away from the Fed thing, I wanted to comment a bit more generally, because this is a good point.
I had a problem with the chart and its definition of 'recession', but I didn't bring it up before because it distracted from the point I was trying to make. The chart is showing us the value of the stock market, but for most Americans the stock market is irrelevant. Stock market value is a measure of willingness of investors to speculate, which does tell you something about the economy, but it doesn't indicate how healthy the economy is in a general sense, for the average person. The stock market has gone up healthily the past few years in the USA, for example, but middle class wages have flatlined, or gone up only marginally.
I think something like an equation offsetting GDP per capita against income equality makes more sense as a metric for measuring economic health (and therefore recessions) in terms that make sense to the average person's everyday life.
Data like GDP, for which the most reliable authority is probably the World Bank, is of course subject to some self-reporting, and therefore manipulation. But, these sorts of aggregate statistics are all we have. About the post-2009 climate, in that respect, I'm not sure there's anything special to be alarmed about in that sense. The government has always had, and will always have, an incentive to massage or cherrypick data in ways that benefit their priorities.
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:20:22
Hmm I don't think so, unless the label is wrong at the bottom. It says "Minimum Bitcoin Balance". An address with 50 BTC also has 0.001 BTC, so it would be included in each bar up to 50. Also, the [statistics page]( I referenced says there are 10,586,272 addresses total.

It's an interesting data point, but tough to draw any conclusions from it. It would be possible to make a different argument that with so many high-profile hackings and thefts over the last 18 months, those with significant numbers of bitcoins may have divided them between several wallets to mitigate against loss. But that argument is also speculative.
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:20:04
I believe it is both. 
Editing to say that I understand your point: protocols are more durable than products if they achieve mass adoption. I think IPv4 is far more, let's say, entrenched right now than bitcoin. The entire web relies on IPv4, but really almost nothing really *relies* on bitcoin right now. If there is a lot more integration of bitcoin as a protocol with other services, so that it becomes intertwined in a way that makes it necessary to the function of other things, then it would have that durability.

Buy opportunity, or is DB irreparably fucked?
@_date: 2016-09-18 22:16:39
I'm on the fence about it long-term. 
The concept - global money with no central authority and an immutable ledger -  is probably as significant as the web itself. The concept has provable utility, and if bitcoin remains the de facto standard implementation of that concept, it will be massive.
But as a technologist, I also see bitcoin as a technology. The thing about technology is: almost never does the first example of a useful technology become the predominant use of said technology. Apple didn't invent MP3 players, Microsoft didn't invent DOS, neither of the above invented the mouse, and so on. Point being, I could imagine some bitcoin-alike coming along that usurps bitcoin because it has a more elegant architecture, faster/cheaper payments, easier onboarding process, or any number of other features.
I've dedicated some time and money to bitcoin over the years, so I'm drinking the Kool-Aid, but at the same time it wouldn't surprise me if another innovation replaced it.

Perhaps this would have worked better conceptually if the example was "your car will be able to be your employee", or "your car could be essentially free by paying for itself".
Now, if you mash those three things together with "real AI", maybe at that point there will have been debated and developed a legal framework granting rights to sentient machines on a humanitarian* basis, under which a car could be truly autonomous. But for now, all cars are owned by some person or entity.

There are other things going on besides the Fed. As one example, in the period 1951-now, the USA enjoyed a big strategic geopolitical advantage. Other than some ships in a harbor, the USA was untouched by WWII, while most other rich countries' infrastructure was devastated by bombing. Russia, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the UK, Japan, China, the Koreas...they all faced big reconstruction projects after the war, whereas the USA could turn its relatively untouched infrastructure into a big manufacturing machine almost immediately.
In a nutshell, the USA didn't have a lot of competition for a while after WWII.  It was able to build up a lot of wealth in those first 40-50 years selling shit to everyone, and only in the past 25-30 years or so are other nations offering real competition (coincidentally in that time the fortunes of the American middle class have more or less flattened).
So, undoubtedly the Fed has something to do with the state of the economy, but in order to assess its effectiveness, we would need to control, somehow, for greater events in the world and the circumstances they create.
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:13:30
Ahh OK, we're using different standards of comparison, so it depends on our vantage point. In the way I meant it, I wouldn't have included any of those in the same category as bitcoin, because none of them (except maybe digicash?) were both based on cryptography and decentralized.
eGold was backed by gold and centralized. eCash was cryptographically signed, but centralized. Liberty dollar was backed by silver and centralized. Hashcash wasn't really designed as a system of money, per se, at least from what I understand. 
Bitcoin seems to be a new category of technology separate from those in that it's money, it's completely decentralized, and it relies on nothing more than cryptography to guarantee value.
@_date: 2016-09-20 21:08:14
Semantics aside, I think you've articulated exactly how we can know if bitcoin will (or will not) own the future. If you think of it as a protocol, then it comes down to: if enough stuff relies on it, then it will have durability (indeed, like IPv4, protocols can even have *too much* durability). If you think of it as an end user feature, then its existence will always be under threat from competing alternatives, but its success then basically relies on adoption: it'll be huge if enough people use it.  I guess for me it's a hybrid of protocol and product (just like it's a hybrid of commodity and currency), and so the real indicator will be some mix of these, plus the technical issues you mention (like scalability, which does seem to be a real issue).
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:58:43
My argument is: tell me what the number is, and why that’s the number.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:54:38
One reason: we have no idea what that number is. I could envision scenarios where there are millions or billions of transactions per second. Maybe my quite logical assumptions are too conservative, even.
This is also why setting up a system which accommodates multiple layers of transactions is sensible; then these various layers can be designed to cope with the load they require, and the main chain can be the master settlement layer.

It seems to me that whether the Fed was involved directly in this specific situation isn’t the most important question. FinCEN rules are a convenient, arbitrary mechanism for controlling who can and cannot move large amounts of money. This trait would seem to benefit the entity controlling the money supply (i.e., the Fed and other elite interests). 
Personally, that the FBI enforced the law isn’t as interesting to me as the fact that those regulations exist in the first place. The government + the Fed + big business aren’t a monolith, but nevertheless there are systems of incentives that tie some of their actions together toward shared goals (an example being exerting control over capital flow).

Great points about the legal limbo in which bitcoin finds itself. There are always pros and cons to any situation.

Money: "A medium that can be exchanged for goods and services and is used as a measure of their values on the market, including among its forms a commodity such as gold, an officially issued coin or note, or a deposit in a checking account or other readily liquefiable account."
I don't think Bitcoin is necessarily an "or". It's money, like gold or dollars or air miles (can be exchanged for goods and services). It's also a commodity, like gold, that can be traded on the market. And it's also currency, like the dollar, because it's easily divisible and can be used to buy stuff. It is / can be all of those things.

To be fair, there weren't many transactions in the early days.  As one of the people affected by the OS X database corruption bug, I've had to re-download the blockchain a couple of times, and it breezes through the first few years, but takes forever to download late 2012's and 2013's transactions. And in my opinion, Bitcoin doesn't even have 0.1% of the users it could potentially have. There's probably a few hundred or maybe few thousand merchants accepting it; imagine if everyone did. Hell, imagine if just amazon.com did. The size of the blockchain may well become a problem if you imagine many, many more transactions taking place.
