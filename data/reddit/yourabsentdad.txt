They want too much for them.  Considering that you can get an S9 which is several TH faster than the R4 for about $60 more is a shame.  If the R4's had been priced in the $800~$999 range, I'd have purchased one.

So the Diff will be exponentially greater by the time the public is able to get their hands on these.  There needs to be more manufacturers in other countries.  Not everything has to be made in China right?

take my upvote you glorious bastard

Thank you China!

Thank you for the info!

I don't disagree that we're talking about a massive amount of potential combinations.  It's how those words are chosen that I'm looking at now.  PC's aren't known for being very random and that means that potential list of combinations may be reduced to a quantity that can be brute forced within ones lifespan or even quicker.
I'm not trying to steal anybody's wallets or anything of the sort.  I'm just fascinated with cryptography and how it's implemented.  Maybe I can find a weakness in how it's implemented or even better, find that it's bulletproof.
Lots of people say that being open source means that it's more secure because everyone can audit the code.  However, remember openssl?  NIST x CIA?  I just want to check and verify for myself and maybe help bitcoin.  Lots of people want to see bitcoin fail and verifying and checking can provide the confidence to help it succeed.

Where can I get a copy of the word list?  I'm sure you're right about the combination count being massive enough to prevent a brute force type of attack.  I just like to verify and check.  Maybe I'll learn a new aspect of bitcoin that I wasn't aware of.  I've learned so much about economies, politics, banking, and more thanks to bitcoin.

Forgive my ignorance.  Can you please define what spam transactions are?  Also, what is the standard to define a low value transaction?  I'm genuinely curious about this aspect of bitcoin.  Thanks!

Misleading title.  You should feel bad.

1. How many bitcoins did you have when you started?
2. Why the number 21?
3. How did you prepare to pay for things before you went to your next country?

ELI5 me what you mean LTC is less secure by design.  Isn't it a fork of bitcoin?  They also have segwit and larger block sizes.

I was under the impression that memory intensive algorithms were ASIC resistant.  That's the reason I'm told that ETH mining is limited to GPU's because the cost of memory makes ASIC development unprofitable.

You nailed it on the head!  My thoughts are why bother going to 8 decimal places if the core devs only want to transact in full bitcoins?  Bitcoin is meant to provide to those who do not have stable or any banking options.  They sure won't be trading in full btc on a regular basis.

You're underestimating stupidity.  Also underestimating greed.
@_date: 2016-02-17 17:45:45
You just blew my mind.  This is a perspective I hadn't thought of and appreciate having.
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:05:13
So this is a bad thing?  Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:51:36
I think it's still up for debate on if it's a good feature or not.  Time will tell us that.

Old news.  This was demonstrated at Defcon just last year.  Go to the defcon site to get a copy of the presentation for free.

It'll process.  Last time I did a no fee transfer it took just over 10 hours to process.  No need to fret.

Congrats!  Fingers crossed this ends up in hardware the common man can purchase.

How and where did you get the data to make those pretty images?  I'd like to check the numbers myself.

Your aversion to a hard fork seems baseless.  Take openoffice for example, it was hard forked into Libre and enjoys even greater success compared to the original.  The mechanisms to expand bitcoin core were implemented in it's creation.  Increasing the block size was proposed way back then and anticipated to be increased as things progressed.  The addition of SW, LN, side chains and so on are adding more complexity from fear that a hard fork would ruin the party.  It also doesn't hurt that those who are pushing SW, LN and so on are those being VC backed so of course they will be pushing their "solutions" because they will then profit.  Bitcoin should look for solutions that will benefit the masses and avoid solutions that will benefit the few.  Otherwise, bitcoin would be no different than the systems it's meant to replace.

It shouldn't happen but guess what?  The feds are watching, we are watching those coins that hospital paid.  Even if they sold each coin to an individual to convert back to fiat.  Those responsible will make a mistake.
