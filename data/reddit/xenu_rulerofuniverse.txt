"Had Mr. Ulbricht seen the F.B.I. coming, and simply closed the laptop, password protections probably would have kicked in, turning the hard drive into what Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, called “an encrypted lump” that would have been “tougher to break into than Fort Knox. Whatever tactics were used — the F.B.I. would not comment — they worked. ”"

"Bitcoin and Wire Transfers give you the best rate when acquiring tokens. Purchasing 100 tokens costs: 0,01394 bitcoin"
200 tokens = around $16.07 (Using bitstamp price I guess and it is supposed to be 16 bucks I think but a bit of small changes)
"Credit card:  200 tokens for $20,99"
"wire transfer: he minimum purchase for wire transfer is $250.00. All purchases are credited at $0.08 per token"

Mining can get you more coins if you're lucky and get the new asic miners fast. 
It's sort of a trade-off between difficulty and price, which one will go up faster? I can't tell. Also we're reaching the limits with asic miners now with 28nm chips. This will mean that the difficulty willl reach a plateau. 
For the small folk buying would be more profitable considering the trade-offs with all the uncertain risks.

1. That's very unusual if it was the case. The police always informs the public and so far they have made no statement about an investigation.
Like I said this fits the theory, because there is an investigation, but against the users, not for them.
2. So if it's fraud it is also very unusual that police is so silent about it. It's new to me that they don't care about half a billion dollar. If I had a business and half a billion was missing, I would be in jail in a day. 
3. Other exchanges provided blockchain evidence of the hack and they weren't talking about disappearing coins and strangely finding some coins by miracles.
4. Aftermath. If the drug sellers kept their coins since 2011, they are now filthy rich. Investigating mtgox is neccessary for them  maybe they found something interesting with bitinstant and also they revealed the JTAN backup server which has all the silk road data. 
5. Mark has bailed out bitomat.pl in 2011. I don't think he's a bad guy. He fought against banks and gov for us and he was doing ok. We know he's a php autist and that hacking was always a threat to mtgox. But the losses would be limited to the hot wallet imo. So why would that change overnight? I think it's more likely that the powerful enemies he and we are fighting have crushed him.

If I had to choose between hack, fraud and seizure. I would say it's a seizure. It's not directly a FBI seizure. But the FBI is heavily involved in the investigation and because of the huge amount of users and countries involved this is a huge multi-national investigation that will take some time. I'm thinking about over 30 countries. Some people will get house visits and evil letters from tax authorities. I think that's whats behind the mtgox drama.

1 Token Bitcoin = 0.08 + little price fluctuation
1 Token Wire = 0.08
1 Toke Credit Card = 0.105
It's pretty good pricing. Gives the business and the customer the advantage and that's how it should be.

Ok that makes sense. 
I just don't think it makes that much sense to buy bitcoin with fiat transfer it and then sell it for fiat. I know it's cheaper and has certain advantages but why not go the full way? Work for bitcoin, transfer bitcoin, buy stuff for bitcoin. That's even even more efficient and you don't have to rely on one or two fiat exchanges (who also don't work for free)

What evidence could we have if this was really the case? Leaking information from ongoing investigations happens rarely. 
I know that we don't have evidence, but that's because we don't have any evidence at all. 
We have 3 scenarios:
- Hack
- Fraud
- Gov Seizure
Why don't get more info about the hack (blockchain evidence)? Why is the police not investigating the fraud of half a billion dollar? Maybe because higher authorities are involved?
Where's is the critical thinking of the bitcoin community? All the computer specialists just eat the dumb answers published on the mtgox.com website where they lie about how "oldformat wallets used prior june 2011" when they were used in september and november 2011 who believes this shit? What's the truth? 
We only get mysterious comments by Mark. And it's not like mtgox wasn't related to Silk road at all. 
Do you really think the authorities wouldn't investigate a billion dollar drug market in all directions? Bitinstant was connected to mtgox. 
It's not just hope, it's critical thinking. That doesn't mean it's true, but it's a possibility that we have to explore further until we get blockchain evidence for the lost coins.

What's the meaning?
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:43:10
It's in favor of your argument. 
Having something doesn't mean you own something. Mtgox has the 200k coins, but they are owned by the customers the ToS clearly states that. 
Whoever wants to buy Mtgox has to inject own capital to run the business.
And of course negotiate with creditors. Maybe haircut + future profits. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:45:53

It's a very tough business. 
"airlines face the problem that there is little competition in the industries that supply them. Two firms—Airbus and Boeing—provide the majority of the planes, and airports and air-traffic control are monopolies. At the same time the industry is vulnerable to outside shocks, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, outbreaks of illnesses such as SARS or bird flu, and rises in the oil price. But the outlook is brightening. America’s airlines are consolidating, passenger numbers are growing, especially in Asia, and forecasts suggest that global profits could hit nearly $20 billion in 2014, with margins of 2.6%—pitiful in other industries but stellar for airlines. Unless, of course, something unexpected causes the skies to darken once again."

Thank you very much, would tip but... also hard times.
The 530,000 BTC numer comes from the 200k coins that were moved. The way coinsight counted them the stuck transactions were stacked. I checked some of the transaction and they always traced back to the 200k coins but of course I checked with a small sample size. Maybe someone who made a graph can confirm the 200k coins caused the 530k number.

Sony, Nintendo, Steam will likely accept Bitcoin at some point because they only sell stuff.

Probably yes. But why would need financial regulation for that? If someone robs you of your money it's already punishable you don't regulation for that. You only have to reform the justice system for that. Instead of putting thiefes in the cage they should repay their damage.
The real reason for financial regulation of course is to make sure the government gets their money. Somebody has to make sur that they have enough money to like uhm pay a Supernintendo 130k a year.

In what way would that be bad? People who would abuse that are not the people who make good decisions anyway. 
It would be bad for doctors and pharmacists. In some countries people run 20 times a year to doctors. Because they have chronical diseases and need to get the prescription that only a doctor can prescribe. The doctor scams the money out of this bureaucratic bullshit and if you live in socalist Europe there is a fixed price that pharmacists get on each med sold. How much advice do you need on a med you've been taking for 20 years? You have to pay the fee every time without needing any advice. Stop scamming sick people ffs.

Andreessen added, “My prediction is that the libertarians will turn on bitcoin. The libertarians will discover that the blockchain is public,” referring to bitcoin’s public ledger of transactions.

Yes. Let me simplify an example. Bitcoin 2.0 is just released with 10 Coins. The first coin ever is for sale for $5. $5 Cash and $50 Market cap. You only need $50 if you want to buy all coins at the market price.
So in reality my lame estimate is that you could push Bitcoin to 1 trillion with 10 bn cash. But that is possibly wrong because "Sell walls" will appear. But in general you need less cash to reach a certain market cap. I'm bad at explaining hope you're understanding what I'm trying to say ;)

This is nothing compared to the one to 30 dollar hype in 2011. Bitcoin is here to stay now. 
Now everything is about the real benefits of bitcoin. It isn't to small anymore as an excuse. Lower prices, faster and cheaper transactions.  Might take another 2 years till we hit 30 million users and by then the market cap will exceed 100bn.

From what we see in reality prices aren't going down really. What makes things less costly? The prices of most services, goods and assets have certain cost factors that will only change through speculation and inflation. The price of one hour labour will not go down (not only for the minimum wage). Some technological revolutions will make things cheaper, but then a new floor is reached. You won't be able to produce apples cheaper, only with biotechnology breakthroughs maybe. 3d printers are another breaktrough that will cause some prices to go down, but other than that from what we experience in reality prices don't go down.
If you look at the data for money velocity it also has been going down.
In order to fix M*V=P*Q 
M+V- = P+ Q+ 
With velocity going down, prices going up, economic output going up you'd have to increase money supply to make things stay the way they are, otherwise in the longterm increase in money demand will cause some kind of trouble. 
"Under this rule, there would be no leeway for the central reserve bank as money supply increases could be determined "by a computer" and business could anticipate all monetary policy decisions"
Maybe this is what will kill Bitcoin in the longterm and some competitior will takeover....

This where the 200k coins came from. The supervisor has obviously no clue abouth anything bitcoin related and needs to investigate where the bitcoins are. He's not capable of doing that and it seems it's too inconvienent for him to consult with experts that can do that. 
The missing 650k are harder to find because I think they are stored in smaller amounts. But we all know bitcoins don't disappear. The records are somewhere on the blockchain if they were stolen. Blockchain evidence is needed and it shows that the supervisor is too incompetent to get the blockchain evidence.

"An indictment in a parallel but separate investigation, run out of Baltimore, included this startling detail: Some of Dread Pirate Roberts’s booty was spent to commission killings — six killings in total, to be done by hit men whose targets were deemed by Dread Pirate Roberts to threaten Silk Road.
None of the orders resulted in actual deaths, the authorities said. One, in fact, was an elaborate fiction concocted by a federal agent posing as a drug dealer. In a scene that sounds as if it were lifted from “Breaking Bad,” federal agents traveled to Utah to fake a beating and execution, sending the evidently grisly photographs to D.P.R., as the government calls him in its complaint."

Depends on how you look at it. 12 million people in the US earn 600 billion dollar every year. Money circulates. M*V=P*Q. Let's say V (velocity of money) is 10 then M (money) would be 60 billion dollar = Their GDP * Price index.
If you do the math in order to get Bitcoin to 600 billion dollar you would need 120 million americans doing their economic activity in bitcoin at a speed rate of 10. 10 is very high, I think it's somewhere 2-4 for the US right now. So you would need 24-48 million americans doing their economic activity in bitcoin. Or if 240-480 million people in the western world would do 10% of their economic activity in bitcoin. 
What we are having is a money revolution and people don't see it. From stones to gold to paper to digital units.

That really doesn't fit their philosophy. They want to dominate mobile payments and make tons of money with it. How do you make money with bitcoin as a company like Apple?
They design all their hardware so you can't even do anything yourself and have to buy tons of aftersales shit and repairs only by apple stores. 
My screen of my htc phone died once when I left it in the car at like -10°C or whatever. I bought a new screen for 20 bucks from china and repaired it. You can't even open your iphone case without a special screwdriver, because they want to make money with that shit as well.

But it's not only about remittance business, think about global trade. I saw a documentary once where a big airline company bought new planes from boeing and the payment process was a pain in the ass. They used some kind of special credit card (???) to pay the hundreds of millions. Of course transactions of this scale are only futuristic but it shows how bad the status quo is for international trade. 
But like you said if you look at Bitcoin as a service it has a lot of stuff to offer. Wealth storage, global fast transactions, low fees that no other company will ever beat simply by design. And that's the key part all the current economic experts don't get.

It can be more than 3% in some countries for some branches. The main problem is that the merchants can't charge different prices because their contracts with the credit card companies prohibit them from doing that and you can also guess who made surcharge fees illegal. Businesses have to decide wether they want to be serfs to credit card companies or if they are willing to accept bitcoin with benefit to themselves and their customers. I'm not forcing them to do anything and bitcoin doesn't need help for the future it's fine without begging merchants to accept it.

Credit cards are nice if you don't consider the fees they bring with them. The customer doesn't see them and that's planned. The problem is the merchants still don't offer different prices that considers the payment fees. If you pay with credit card your price should be 3-5% higher. Even cash is expensive for a lot of merchants. They pay huge premiums for the security forms to collect the cash. Paying via phone provides a huge benefit. The main advantage of bitcoin over paying with phone is that you don't have to pay a bunch of employees neccessary for the transaction system.

No. I'm not saying Mark has anything to do with Silk Road. The users do.
"Just days after the F.B.I. served the search warrant on JTAN, Mr. Nadovich began taking steps to close parts of his business. In a Sept. 14 online notice to JTAN customers that still appears on the company’s website, Mr. Nadovich said he was terminating the firm’s “dedicated server” business. Mr. Nadovich gave no explanation but said “the business situation we find ourselves in does not allow continuing this service.” On Oct. 30, he posted another notice, telling JTAN customers the company was struggling financially and could file for bankruptcy protection in 2014."
Does that sound familiar? That's what happened to the owner of the company where Silk Road had backup servers.

They made around 1k bitcoin in the last two days in fees. They might have lost a ton of coins, but people need to remember that they are the richest exchange out there. (Maybe not anymore)
The coins they lost they can easily replace with their own coins, otherwise the exchange would have been already closed or we would have seen some sudoku action. If they lack the funds or coins they're comitting fraud right now - which wouldn't be worth it. Insolvency &gt; fraud.

People have to realize the war on crypto has already begun. Whenever a business or project suddenly stops without proper explanation by the owner/founder I would consider it successfully attacked. 
The current strategy by three letter agencies is to do as much damage as possible with as little public outcry as possible. 
And Bitcoin is also on their list. Maybe even Mtgox. It would have been the perfect target. Semi-incompetent owner with a juvenile history in fraud. 
Bitlocker, Coinbase, Bitstamp are so much better because they are more under their control.

Nobody curious why the authorities are so silent in this case? If my business loses half a billion dollar I would be in jail in no time. The reason why the authorities are so silent is because higher authorities are behind this.
If it's related to silk road, then the cold wallets in bank safety deposits are seized and there is a multi-national investigation in which over 30 countries are involved. 
From what it seems Mark is trying as much as it is possible to fuck with the investigation. That's why all the retarded information is published. He's probably one of us, don't burn the bridge yet. Mtgox has always been under attack by banks and gov and Mark fought for us.

Money times velocity = Price level * real value of output | GDP.
The GDP of the world is about 70 trillion dollar right now. I don't know how high the velocity of bitcoin is right now or would be. If it's 1 (and the only used payment system) then the value of 1 Bitcoin would be:
70 trillion dollar / 12 mil bitcoin = 5,8 million. 
If the velocity is 10 then it would be 70 trillion dollar / 120 million = 580k dollar and so on. 
M1 velocity in US = 7ish, M3 in 2004 was about 1,5ish (for scale)

From what I've seen people subscribe for $5 a month to famous streamers on this streaming plattform. You can subscribe with paypal or credit card. Twitch.tv should add bitcoin as a payment option. Maybe some tweets and e-mails can help. It should be easy for them to implement it with coinbase or a similar company.

Thx for the imaginary tip ;) 
I have enough coins, keep yours! 
Just looked at the data, transaction volume last 24hours about 2 million. So the velocity of bitcoin would actually be quite higher than it is for fiat currency. Although there a lot of "backup transactions".
But with 2 million btc transactions a day, the velocity would be 60 and a 50 billion dollar economy would result in 83$ price per btc.

Quantity theory of money.
Make estimates about the size of the future bitcoin economy and about the velocity of money and you get a good estimate of the future bitcoin price. 
Then you'll see what price can be achieved if bitcoin keeps growing. Assuming there is no competitor destroying bitcoin. 
If we have a 30 billion dollar bitcoin economy by 2018 and the velocity of the money is 5 and we have 12 million bitcoin then 1 bitcoin should be worth around 500$. 
if the economy is 50 billion dollar and the velocity of money is only 1 (which is very slow) then one bitcoin would be worth 4160 dollar.

"Kovner's first trade was in 1977 for $3,000, borrowed against his MasterCard, in soybean futures contracts. Realizing growth to $40,000, he then watched the contract drop to $23,000 before selling.[5] He later claimed that this first, nerve-racking trade taught him the importance of risk management.
In March 2011, Kovner had an estimated net worth of around $4.5 billion"

It will need a lot of growth in the internet economy and it needs BTC to the major currency for that.
About 2 trillion of the US GDP is e-commerce, let's say 30bn dollarz is achievable for a global btc economy then we can see 500-2000$ per BTC.
Depending on the velocity. M*V=P*Q

It's already done I know but I think Bitcoin will take this to the next level. They won't be able to enforce the laws they way they used to when they had central oversight. I see two solutions. Adjust the law or try to take the control back. 
Or even if they know you have a lot of assets in bitcoin how do they seize them when they don't know the wallet adress? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:42:12
For me the important question is how much money do we need in the exchange system to get like to 100bn. You don't need 100bn in fiat to get bitcoin to 100bn.
Apple stocks have like 500bn market cap and a daily trading volume of like 6bn. Bitcoin has a 10b market cap with only 20 mil daily volume. If no big walls appear we can hit very high market caps with only hundreds of millions in the market daily.
