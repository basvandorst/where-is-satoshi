If I don't own my shares, then why do I get to vote them? By owning shares of a stock purchased through a broker, I own those shares of stock. I'm not sure what you're talking about.

volume's been really low since the drop. Someone was buying up a ton of GBTC for whatever reason. From June 3 - June 24 (when the price got crazy), average volume was 25,100 shares a day. Since then, average volume has been 8,837 shares a day.  
It's just technical IMO. People have known about COIN for a long time.

gbtc mega drop is more due to the fact that the price got way out of control. At one point it was trading at almost a 100%  premium to BTC (85.7% on 7/11). Yesterday's closing premium of 43.2% is still higher than the lifetime mean of 33.1%.  
TL;DR GBTC is going through a correction based on fundamental value

according to the current trades on that futures market that I posted. It's the only future trade that I'm aware of on whether COIN is approved.

Their decision on whether to approve the Winklevoss ETF (COIN will be the ticker if approved)

I don't think so. It's a pretty esoteric trade and the volumes don't look high enough.

to that, I don't know. if you see the market going crazy, you'll know the news is out. I wouldn't be surprised if they wait until after 4:30 PM to release the news tomorrow. I believe they have until 3/11 to make a determination.

[I think this graphic is one of the most important parts of the article]( it emphasizes that (much to the chagrin of most in this sub) blockchain != bitcoin in the context of the article. Masters is developing a product that *could* connect her customers with BTC, but it's not the primary at this time.

Wall Street is looking at creating individual blockchains to trade syndicated loans and many other financial products. I don't think that the intention is to denominate the deals in BTC.

I don't think the intention is to do these deals in BTC but to use a unique blockchain as the ledger.

assuming OP gets his access back I would say its newsworthy, otherwise you're giving a lot of negative press to the uninformed public. It's not the way to win people over.
