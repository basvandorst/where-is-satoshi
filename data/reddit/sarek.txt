Was that guy "BTC"?

Thanks for the heads up!

If you look at the times when CBOE and CME opened up bitcoin futures and when this Mt. Gox trustee started selling BTC, he or anyone who knew he was about to dump 18k BTC into the market may have very well had a good idea how much of an effect it would have on the price of BTC and opened up some futures. I don't think monitoring the Mt.Gox address would have been enough to benefit, but I am not sure.
It's an interesting theory because, at a glance, futures tradings and the Mt.Gox selloffs coincide closely. (I have also heard he made an average over 10k per BTC he sold. Which is pretty good, imo, especially for such a large amount of BTC. No idea how much he may have made from futures contracts, though.)

I don't buy this part. Women are valuable. This may happen, but I don't think it'd be common.

I don't think he liked Jed.

I like the idea of using the word "bit" as a denomination. It makes a lot of intuitive sense.
"Bit" sounds like a fundamental piece of a Bitcoin. Will Satoshi always be the smallest unit of a Bitcoin possible?
So I guess you could say I might favor a "bit" being worth even less than a Satoshi.

Very, very special.
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:58:12
No.. I don't think that's right. (And in general, wallstreet investors aren't that dumb.) But the small number of units might be hindering adoption.

Could probably fund it with some stupid token.

It was satellite. Zzzzzz.

Eh, start to lose traction around the third point tbh.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:58:18
But can you pay for it in crypto
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:30:25
That's what $20 gets you.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:47:34
Musk will fix that.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:53:06
You're not really understanding what he's saying, or you're refusing to accept it or think about it. He's right, honestly. Putting coins in your own wallet is dangerous.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:43:20
BTC blockchain was already too god damn big to download in 2011/2012.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:58:37
This is what bothers me about it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:12:45
You are definitely right.. I agree. I'm not saying those aren't dangerous as well. Dealing with your own keys comes with its own dangers. A HARDWARE wallet is likely best, but it still has risks and dangers associated with it.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:40:52
Actually, you basically can "hack" quite a few keys. But whatever.

I can't wait for that day. I believe bitcoin is more "deflationary" than it is "inflationary" and I think that's important for some reason. There seems like there's a lot to be done before BTC or another cryptocurrency can start being used effectively in common daily transactions..
I also think BTC would have to take over fiat (or people have massive faith in it, in which case it has/is/will) before businesses stopped converting it into fiat (I don't see how BTC would hold a stable price). That only makes sense in my mind.
