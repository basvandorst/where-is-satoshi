That (mostly) makes sense. Thanks for the detailed explanation!
So as I understand it, BreadWallet and Blockchain (the mobile apps) are deterministic wallets. BreadWallet gave me a passphrase when I initialized my wallet, which I wrote down and stored in my safe. That will allow me to recover all my BTC should I lose my phone or it gets wiped, correct? (unless, of course, someone spends those coins before I get a chance to do a recovery and transfer the BTC to a new wallet)
If paper wallets are not deterministic and therefore prone to user error and losing BTC, is there a better option for cold storage of large amounts of BTC?

Is there a good place to get a crash course on all this? I feel like I'm missing some of the fundamentals of the tech behind Bitcoin. Like, I checked out bitaddress.org above.. and it opens up all kinds of questions:
* The private key is used to unlock my wallet, correct?
* If the Bitcoin address + private key = my wallet, does that mean that my balance information is somehow stored in this info? If I've got 2 BTC for instance, where is that information stored, if not on a server (since Bitcoin is decentralized)?
* Can I attach a passphrase to my private key, a la PGP?
* I know it's recommended to use a different Bitcoin address for every transaction, for privacy purposes. How can I generate a new address from my private key, without relying on an app? (if that's possible)

Gotcha. I'll read up about change on the official wiki.
@_date: 2016-05-12 22:49:14
Just curious, why do you say "instant*"? I signed up on Gemini, and the ACH transfers appear to be no more expedient than Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-05-16 21:35:14
It doesn't show less than 30 days though.
@_date: 2016-05-07 09:39:29
Interesting. It sounds like paper wallets (or any private key) were meant to be completely emptied, which is why I’m assuming everyone has been recommending that route.
@_date: 2016-05-07 22:07:41


Except for being in 100% control of your money. And being able to get paid overseas in 10-15 minutes with minuscule fees, as opposed to slow wire transfers with large fees. And total privacy. And...the list goes on.
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:50:54
Awesome, thanks for the comprehensive reply!


You meant Unspent Transaction Outputs, right?
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:53:00


Not concerned about that, as I have a giant fireproof safe. :)


Solid advice, thanks!
@_date: 2016-05-10 17:48:36
Oh, I didn't even know about Coinbase Exchange. Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:14:08
Oh geez. Ok, BTC, $, €, whatever :) Just focus on the concept I'm presenting in my question.
@_date: 2016-05-07 09:52:04
BTW, if I have 50,000 bits in my wallet and I send someone 20,000, I’ll definitely be left with 30,000. Why is doing a partial import from a private key unpredictable?
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:59:38
I was a bit concerned about Airbitz. The official Bitcoin site says it has centralized validation:


Is that a cause for concern? Why does Airbitz even need a username and password from me? BreadWallet doesn't.
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:37:53
Wait, I'm confused. I never sent $1.76 to myself, I just sent $0.18. And I don't know how I'm able to see my addresses in my wallet (I use Airbitz).
@_date: 2016-05-10 19:57:08
Don't even get me started on KYC with Kraken. They asked for my full SSN, I put in all 9's. I photo'd my driver's license AND supplied a photo of myself holding my license, censored the DL# in both pics, they asked me not to. I can't imagine why they'd need my full SSN or DL In fact, even supplying the last four digits of one's SSN is extremely risky, as that's all someone needs to pose as you during a phone call with your bank.
I'll check out Gemini. Hopefully they don't ask for ridiculous things pertaining to my identity.
@_date: 2016-05-08 14:11:41
Cool, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:02:09
Well excuse me for being brand new to Bitcoins!
So you're saying if I have a paper wallet that has $1000 on it, and I scan it with BreadWallet and transfer $500 over, if someone were to break into my house and scan my paper wallet, they would be able to transfer more than $500 from it somehow? I don't think so...
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:10:46
And if a service like Airbitz or Coinbase has a backup of my wallet, does that mean the wallet can be compromised if someone gains access to your system? Or would that be impossible since the private keys are only on my iPhone?
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:25:44


How so?
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:06:04
Well, you're basically saying BreadWallet is insecure. That if I scan a private key with it, that key could somehow be compromised. Of course, anyone is welcome to look at the source code..
But in general, I get what you're saying and it makes sense. Depends on how much you trust your mobile wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-07 06:07:06
Thanks, you rock! I'll search on BCT.. what/where is BCT?
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:36:50
Great, thanks for all the helpful info!
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:18:43
How do I find a list of regulated exchanges?
EDIT: CoinBase appears to be regulated. And Bitstamp too, maybe?
@_date: 2016-05-09 22:38:47
Why are fiat currencies more consistent then? I can check on 3 or 4 different sites, and the value of USD to EUR is exactly the same.
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:10:37
Worse how??
Say I've got two private keys: a8f3 which is in my safe, on a piece of paper as a QR code, and 90dc, which is my mobile device. If a8f3 has access to $5000 in the blockchain, and I use my mobile app (90dc) to scan the a8f3 and say "take $4999," then a8f3 only has access to $1 in the blockchain. Someone breaking in and stealing the a8f3 paper wallet is only getting $1.
Is that not correct?
@_date: 2016-05-12 17:37:37
Cheaper than Coinbase's 1%? Granted, that's for bank transfer which takes five business days.
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:23:27
I have not, but I'm gonna give Gemini a try, which also lets you bid.
@_date: 2016-05-08 07:53:32
Based on what? I don't see any glowing remarks about them..
@_date: 2016-05-08 14:10:20
Ha! I hadn’t thought of that for some reason.
@_date: 2016-05-08 20:39:38
1: Oh, there's escrow for Bitcoin? I'll have to look into this.
2: So if I run a shop where I sell something worth $500 to someone, and they pay me, is it wise of me to just keep them in the store till I get confirmations? If so, how many? This seems extremely impractical. I don't see how bitcoins would work for in-person transactions.
4: $1.5M/day, spread out over how many miners globally?
@_date: 2016-05-07 23:01:57
Interesting... I'm trying out Blockchain for iOS, and I quite like it. It doesn't ask for any permissions at all, except for the camera. It also somehow syncs my information to their web app. I'm guessing that's done in a secure manner.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:49:58
What's the security issue with having a single paper wallet? How is the private key at risk if I'm just scanning it to transfer funds over?
@_date: 2016-05-10 19:31:57
Awesome, thanks! Just curious, what don't you like about Coinbase retail?
@_date: 2016-05-11 06:09:13
Ah, you're right.


@_date: 2016-05-09 19:58:49
Is there a definitive "this is THE value of the Bitcoin" source?
@_date: 2016-05-10 19:04:19
Cool. What's your experience with Kraken vs Coinbase Exchange vs Gemini? Any stand-outs? Also, do I have to already be versed in trading to know what I'm doing, or is it a different process than stock trading?
@_date: 2016-05-11 00:17:45
I gave them my full ID, but I entered all 9's for my SSN. There's absolutely *no* reason they need it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:56:02
Where can I find out more about paper wallets? How exactly does one print out their BTCs?
@_date: 2016-05-13 02:49:55
I see. Thanks!
