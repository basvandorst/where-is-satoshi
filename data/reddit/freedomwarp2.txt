I wonder if I can sue them? They didn't close my account I DID, but I'll be damned if I'd give them personal information
of that kind. NO institution can ask those questions. Yes could I have told them anything? Sure. But if you don't resist this crap, it will become de facto. Resist or you will
will find that cash will go the same company asking where way. Pretty soon EVERYTHING will need to be approved. I do nothing wrong
but needing NOT to answer. Where do you spend your money?? You are FORCED to say where you made it. I don't like that. But a PRIVATE company asking WHERE YOU SPEND IT!! FUCK COINBASE.

Coinbase is Scientology . I was helping a person get out. No problems for years. Then I get all kinds of "extra information". Coinbase is Scientology. They control it and I will expose it. Miscavige was what triggered my shutdown.
Nothing at all was directed at me for 3 years. Then Coinbase
suddenly needed to KNOW WTF I was doing?? Bad things?
I was helping. Fuck they are ruined now. DO NOT trust COINBASE to leave you alone. They Monitor and judge every transaction.

I was helping a person that was trapped by Scientology.
Now they might not make it out. BTC let me help them.
They were making it out. I don't have to tell that to my "banker" god dammit. I don't have to tell that to anyone.
DO NOT rely on COINBASE. They have NO business asking
WHERE you spend your money. What are they doing REALLY?? They monitor every transaction you make.
