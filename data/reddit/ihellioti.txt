Fair enough, guess I will make a bot then. 
So what criteria should I use when selecting a single exchange vs another when starting out?
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:17:45
Well yes, I know this, but is there a reasoning? Fees, trust or otherwise?

What about GDAX as someone from the US? Also new and looking into this for the future.

I am a noob, I want to get in later this year. Someone said to get verified by an exchange to save time which I will do but...
Why should I pick one exchange over another if I see for example BTCC is around 9k vs someone like bitfinex for around 6K? Can you move coins between exchanges and make money that way too?

Interesting that there is a direct term for what I thought would just simply be a basic sale. Also thanks for the answer friendly person.

I still Haven't bought in because it's more beneficial to me to rid of a payment first since it's guaranteed. However, I want to buy in probably this year. 
Trying to get knowledgeable before I do spend. Other than trial and error what has best served you for learning more specifically about crypto? 
I still regret not buying when they first offered coins cheap. Mouse was on the buy button but I didn't want to waste money at the time. Around 2013-2014 sigh.

Good luck to both of you. I am just watching eating popcorn at work trying to get money to invest.

I will do that, however my question about exchanges is this. Why should I pick one exxhange over another if I see for example BTCC is around 9k vs someone like bitfinex for around 6K? Can you move coins between exchanges and make money that way too?

One hurts your head the other hurts your wallet. Your priorities determine which is worse.
