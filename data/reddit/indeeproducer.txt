Give it a look-see. It's a different movie. Same director, same producers, several of the same cast members. The same people that made the original did the sequel.

THANK YOU! I hope you like the film. Make sure you download both. Watch the first as a refresher before the new film!

Hunh? Not true. Just "The Man From Earth: Holocene". Nothing else was "baked" in unless someone else added more ingredients that we are unaware of.

We had been asked for years by fans around the world for more story. We thought we would give it a shot. I agree it's a tough movie to make a sequel for (like making a sequel to "The Breakfast Club"). But when you have a protagonist that's been around for 14,000 years it does feel like there's more story to tell.

Ouch. I agree that's it's not as good as the first, but terrible? : (

Thank you. A decade ago I said I would do this and kept my word. I'm grateful the the file-sharing community helped bring attention to the first film and that didn't get past me. We have a long way to go to get to breakeven so hopefully people that download will contribute something, even if they didn't love the movie. It's a big risk we are taking here, but I think it's well worth it. I hope you like the movie.

First movie is called "Jerome Bixby's The Man From Earth".
The sequel is called "The Man From Earth: Holocene". 
(for the record I originally wanted to call it "The Man From Earth 2" or 'The Man From Earth II" but I lost that argument.)
Yes... same creators.
BOTH are on TPB but we didn't upload the first one ourselves. Fans did that and it took on a life of its own. We did upload the sequel ourselves.

Awesome. Thanks so much!

I don't disagree with your assessment. Making movies is hard. Sequels are harder. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:43:37
Thank you. It loves you too.

There's a grey area here. We "pirated" our own movie because if we didn't do it, someone else would have (see how the first TMFE went down) anyway. The difference between us and other filmmakers is that we have embraced the file-sharing / streaming (gotta give love to Kodi box peeps) community. It's not that the community has "the legal right" to it. Think of it like those old newspaper vending machines where you put .50 in and you are only supposed to take one paper. It's worldwide distribution by way of the honor system. We still own the film and shared it with everyone. We hope they recognize that and support the movie in return.

We are certainly trying to be "better". As an independent filmmaker, I'm open to new ideas. Yes, we hope to get to at least breakeven with this film (God, I hope), but also, we do want people to see our work too. Hope you like the movie.

Awesome! Thank you so much. You have no idea how much we have learned about crypto-currency in the last couple weeks! I really appreciate your support!
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:43:53
I hope so too. THANK YOU!
