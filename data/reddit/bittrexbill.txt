Hi Tookie_Tookie,
We are committed to legal compliance and will take the necessary steps to ensure that our exchange will remain available to the community.  
As of this time, we only require email addresses but reserve the right to request more information in the future.  We will provide notice to our users and you will have the option to terminate your account.  Our goal is the collect the minimum amount of information required by US law.
We do not provide fiat transactions at this time.  Our exchange currently only supports virtual currencies.  
At this time, we are researching our options regarding FinCen.  It is our understanding that we have 6 months to become fully compliant.

Hi ChiSunTimes,
We realize that the exchange of crypto-currencies requires a significant amount of trust.  We've been scammed before by faceless entities both in and out of our home country.  We’re hoping that providing the identities and credentials of the founders will provide some assurances of our sincerity and commitment to transparency.
