What if economic majority tie up funds in time lock and HF to mis-allocate more funds to their bottom line? Isnt that an issue or am i looking at this wrong?

What if new coin doesnt support LN?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:22:40
Your assuming that breaking use cases would make incentive not to HF without LN?

They are racing downhill... 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:17:27
yes use cases broken i understand. But how does it affect the open LN balances? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:46:05
So once LN is on there is no turning back?
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:45:04
So if LN is implimented then we are stuck with it(not inherently bad,but could be)?

Im asking about an 'attack' in the form of a HF that removes these codes and how that effects the LN balances on legacy chain
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:17:46
Thats entirely possible as i am still learning. I believed that someone could open a LN channel with another party and do transaction not on chain, but when the channel is closed then the result of those transactions(final balances) is then posted to the blockchain as one transaction.

Thats like lightning network. Me and you open a channel and transact for a year before we close the channel. Just the final account balance post to block chain as one transaction. Makes it a distributed balance sheet with incomplete transaction data. Correct?
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:29:26
agreed. but a complete transaction history is better than incomplete.

How do you get everyone to close LN channels and keep people from opening new ones before a HF?  Couldnt someone open many channels with themselves (own multiple addresses) to keep HF from occuring. If said person just wanted to be malicious. Also, Thank you Mr Glurp for taking time out of your day to answer my questions. So much to learn.
