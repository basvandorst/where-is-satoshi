Could someone create a hash with a virus- or a block with a virus?

Doknow- but put the knights of Malta ���� in their now imo-!

you know more than me about this, but I was thinking along the lines of a syncing header with maybe an rf signal- able to crash a node if that's possible. I especially wonder about the likes of waltoncoin or ether with this-but have a way to go before I even talk to a dev. on any subject.

Coinbase è una società di scambio di beni digitali con sede a San Francisco in California (Stati Uniti) e fondata a giugno 2012 da Brian Armstrong e Fred Ehrsam[1]. Excuse the Italian

I’m new to this, but...
Concerning to me is Bitmain going public. Seems to go against decentralization entirely
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:13:12
Way back then, interesting !
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:17:36
I’m with you- bought yesterday but am going hold off for the dive in.
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:53:42
I think Amazon or Whole Foods offers that.!?

Nothing lasts forever- but I gotta think btc will outlast me anyway...
@_date: 2018-11-17 17:24:10
What about the noise?
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:20:00
I am new to this, but I am impressed with the idea of decentralized exchanges. What do you think of crypto-bridge and their bco’s or staking
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:08:04
Cool- so to speak!
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:42:13
BCO in there?
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:24:41
Thx ⚡️��
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:23:08
You may have, but probably not your kids nor the ( in general)government- fiat QE &amp; etc.

How much in btc did it go for?

For me, no more Coinbase- sell my old car, tv, computer , books- for btc, ltc, eth

Is a lightening node more effective in tandem with the core? Or the functionality mostly in monitoring mining?
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:38:37
Amazon have them?

@_date: 2018-07-06 18:23:40
Yeah, fiat - but it’s a trade anyway!
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:28:41
Not me anyway. I’ll bet it’d be at most 7 years if btc keeps this pace! I’m thinking the likes of Coinbase or even Binance would do well to start lobbying for it now.
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:01:53
I don’t think it’s bad for btc- the market is letting the alts settle before next btc bull run- probably right after or even during imo

While our national debt Is “just there” right? We got it covered. Not a cause for concern right ? No correlation to observe here: The United States had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 104.17 percent in 2015 and 105.4 percent in 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Public Debt. The U.S. experienced its highest debt-to-GDP ratio in 1946 at 121.7 percent at the end of World War II, and its lowest in 1974 at 31.7 percent.
US productivity will keep. Acchem “saving” the day! 
I sound messianic, or is it a messed up economic- you got me confused ����‍♂️

...and then there’s the “it will never happen HERE” crowd..or are you going with gold ala the Peter Schiff method?

Cool- sounds like fun!

A topic in itself imo- so much for crypto “following the markets”!

Not what I said, I believe it is going to be inflation @ 15-20% minimum for at least 4 of the next 15 years- or deflation, but you haven’t gained my ear like Ron Paul or even Peter Schiff... the way you react to RPaul strikes me as reactionary-gl!
