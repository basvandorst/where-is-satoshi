We can’t tell you what to do and how to do it, it may plummet to 1k for 3 years and rocket to 100k after that no one knows, do what you want sell or wait a day or two and see the price then high risk/high reward dont play with fire especially if your fucking clothes are made from your college fund you doughnut

We are at a stage were we assign a dollar/pound/euro amount to a bitcoin or a percentage of one, if block chain does take off a bit coin will be a bitcoin, we wont be assigning an amount to it will just be paying 2 satoshi or something to buy a pepsi max we wont be then working out how much fiat the 12 satoshi we just payed will be worth, other coins will definitely come and go but i believe Bitcoin is sort of like a Brand name now for Crypto and wont be going anywhere anytime soon.

I dont know what it is with everyone? So much FUD in this subreddit lately, its a super volatile market hence why there is so much money to be made (and lost) and for some reason the second it drops 20% “THE BUBBLE HAS POPPED LETS SELL MY £15 AT A LOSS AND SHIT POST ABOUT BITCOIN ON REDDIT” i just dont get it i just leave my crypto in and im making money and buy whenever its not at the ATH or when the “bubble” ‘pops’.

Im sure if someone did take all that money your bank would pay you back as it is up to them to look after your money and they have all types of insurances to cover things like this

I think coinbase goes does because the in rush of panic sellers, just a wild theory, i think coinbase closes it self down on purpose to halt the panic selling
