You can also put in a custom sat/B value

So that someone else that knows your email address can't sign you up for notifications.

Mail me the fiat, I'll email you some bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:36:08
Another reason would be typos. What if you mistype your email address? If I didn't verify it I'd end up sending notifications to some random email address that didn't ask for it. Or to an email address that doesn't exist, wasting resources.

Thanks for another bug report :) I'll look into that this evening. And add a response to let you know you're confirmed via SMS.

Also this post is awesome! Thanks for thinking of the EFF! Consider OpenBSD , they do a lot for cryptography. And linux, it does a lot for servers, and probably bitcoin nodes.

I cleared up the duplicate registrations. I also released a code update that will  prevent anyone from registering for the same currency or exchange twice. Thanks again for the bug report.

Replying yes is enough . It doesn’t respond back. I’ll fixed that and have it let you know you’re confirmed. Thanks for trying it  out! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:11:15
Nice. Reminds me of growing up back in Texas :)

That's awesome.

What's the point of it if you can't move your btc out of the app?
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:42:16
Why sell it to you when they can mine for themselves? I have no idea if that's actually it. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:41:56
Or maybe she heard about it elsewhere and got interested?

I just sent $980 for $0.66 . Took a few hours, but I wasn't in a hurry. 
So far I've only used btc to purchase things online. Considering shipping time adding a few hours to the transaction doesn't seem like a big deal. Especially if it's saving several dollars. 
That still sucks though. That would only work in person if merchants were willing to give you the goods with 0 confirmations. I think they should. And their wallet software should check the sending address to make sure it doesn't broadcast a second transaction for the same btc. After a few seconds of only the first transaction being propagated it's unlikely a second transaction will have a chance. 
Even if the size doesn't change, why can't we mine and validate more blocks faster? Internet is fast, asics are fast, and disk space is cheap.

In the past I've recovered files on a formatted, but not securely erased drive like this. Open a file number 0. Read bit by bit through the drive and write it out to that file(on another drive) until you hit the EOF. When that happens close the file. Then open file 1 and repeat. 
Now you'll end up with a ton of numerically named files. Then you'll need to do something to sift through that and find the wallet files.

This is the easiest opportunity to get rich ive ever seen and I can’t take advantage of it :/ 
I tried to get a credit card just to buy bitcoin. Apparently you can’t get credit if you haven’t already been using credit(I’ve never had one or borrowed money). Wft?

Exchange for Monero , exchange the Monero for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 03:34:18
:).   For old time sake.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:32:47
I always go with he lowest fee possible. Confirmations  take ~30minutes to ~10 hours, but I'm ok with that. 
Bitcoin transactions only cost the initial hardware purchase if you're running on solar or other renewable energy.

It's magic internet money.

2 hours is way faster than the several business days it takes a card transaction to go from pending to settled. I always pay the lowest fee my client allows and my transfers go through just fine. I've never paid more than a few cents for a transfer fee using a bitcoin client. Coinbase on the other hand... like $3 each time. But then I found local bitcoins so whatever :)

After spending my last ~16 BTC on pizza over the span of about a year I forgot about bitcoin for years. A few weeks ago my wife let me know the current price of bitcoin, and that we were eating mediocre, ~$1,600 pizza almost every weekend that year.

Makes me like my Trezor even more
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:29:08
Please don't. I still haven't gotten 1 btc yet. Maybe next year after I'm able to buy a little?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:39:30
Why would you pay a $2-5 fee? Set it to like $0.05 and it'll still go through fine. You don't need to wait on a confirmation for a $5 burger, so it doesn't matter if it takes an hour to be confirmed. 
Your credit card transactions aren't confirmed for several business days.

On my phone:
1. Input amount
2. scan qr code
3. press send.
And  is optional. Sometimes the amount is already in the QR code. I just look it over and press send. 
On my computer, for moving bits over to my less secure phone wallet or for large payments:
1. plug in trezor
2. Open  
3. Input PIN
4. Enter Amount
5. Scan QR code or paste address
6. Press send
Is your bitcoin sending experience different from that?
