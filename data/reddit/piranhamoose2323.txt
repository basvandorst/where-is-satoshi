Protecting the country's foreign exchange reserves??  LMFAO!  More like protecting the administration and their cronies pockets.  Argentina was fucking plundered by the govt and their cronies for billions!  And they re-elect the person who did it for years!  Social program funding was split between the administration and private contractors.  Contrators inflated the bill and pocketed the cash.   
Nothing new...  All governments use this system to line their pockets and fuck the working class.  Like Cheney and Haliburton defense contracts,  etc...

And.. how many banks here in the U.S. is also prohibiting their depositors from purchasing bitcoin?  I've heard many people saying their banks are prohibiting transactions to Coinbase.  It's the same thing here in the U.S. to a lesser extent.  Not your bank, not your money.

Only idiots give their money away to thetax man.  There are ways of buying and selling crypto without getting noticed.  Even in the six figure sums.  Youve gotten this far,  use your brain to figure it out.
And yes, Coinbase as the fiat onramp.

This is nothing new. A LOT of banks prohibit transactions to Coinbase,  etc.  It's frustrating because it's MY money.  Swithed to a credit union that allowed transactions to Coinbase.
That is why there is a list of banks and credit unions on the web that allows transactions to Coinbase and the like.

Just call your local branch. Inquire about a mortgage and if they accept btc as collateral. Youll be happy with their answer��

He was praising btc a few years ago,  and even said he owned btc's. Now he's trashing it?  Lol. We all know he owns a substancial amount of btc's.   Even the Mavericks accepts btc for ticket sales etc. 
Cant fool us,  Cuban.

Cryptopia wasnt hacked,  they liquidated.  Sorry for your loss.  I lost some Electroneum in that mess

Yep,  its infuriating.  You can google list of banks that accept transfers to btc exchanges.  Im very happy with NFCU. They even accept btc as collateral for loans.
@_date: 2019-10-02 05:22:32
Yep. I agree

You are succumbing to the Central banks' agenda. CME futures trading to "tame" btc's price to make people doubt,  then give up their btcs.  
Do some research.
And,  btc's price just 8 months ago was $3k.

I understand your theory. And yes, it is possible that this pump MAY have been orchestrated by Bakkt so they can short the hell out of btc. 
But your current mentality is EXACTLY what they want. A psyops of sorts. People buy btc because of FOMO then the price plummets.  This will frustrate the majority of people holding btc and will give up and sell. Like CME said when they launched in Dec 2017, "We will TAME bitcoin!" 
That is their goal.  To frustrate btc holders. The Central banking system is going in with guns blazing.  Keep that in mind.  HODL and chill. Bitcoin is here to stay.

More cause for concern if the wallet was "known."

I dont believe it's a conspiracy "theory," at all.  Its a REAL conspiracy.  And, I hate to break it to ya, but ALL markets are manipulated,  and ALL governments are corrupt.  The extent of manipulation and corruption varies. 
In the Philippines, the corruption is up front.  I get stopped for a traffic offense,  i slip 100 pesos to the cop and all is good. Here in America, only the rich can partake in the corruption.  
Bitcoin is a threat to the Central banking system and more so if its value increases. But, the bitcoin momentum cannot be stopped at this stage. They can "tame" its rise in value momentarily, spread propaganda through the corporate owned media and frustrate the people, but it CANT be stopped.  HODL and chill. The btc momentum is too strong. And getting stronger every year.

Also,  make a note that MSNBC recently said,  "This is a generational buying opportunity!"  Psyops at its best. The average joe will hear this and buys as much btc as he can.   Then BOOM!  The price plummets.  Average joe is now thinking,  "Fuck bitcoin! Its a scam,  a ponzi scheme."  Mission accomplished...  More people disillusioned.
