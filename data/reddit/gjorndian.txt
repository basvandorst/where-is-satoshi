I stopped replying to him based on this same judgement.

The FDIC ( is an independent agency who provides LAWS and ACTS upon the nations banking system to insure consumer protection and stability in our nations currency is around the clock. 
  
Trying to twist my words around to make yourself seem proper and that my statement was false is pretty low.
  
I meant what I said, and say what I meant. If you don't believe it, then thats fine and you are entitled to your opinion, but don't belittle others because you have a false sense of entitlement about your opinion being  the only one that matters.
  
I'm done with this conversation.

And that is exactly what I'm talking about. If it was deemed a currency then it could be protected by the FDIC which would protect the consumer against things such as theft as long as they are maintained within the exchange. 
  
Why is everyone so quick to jump the gun about protecting their "precious"? Seriously..it was a legitimate statement and you are making it out to sound like I'm one of the "regulars" who talk about how "bitcoin just went bankrupt".

As far as I'm aware the "biggest obstacle" is going to be when they decide "well we'll just close this business down and open up a new one with a new name...problems gone!"
This is the issue with businesses who are LLC or Corporations...

We continue seeing trends of hackers stealing everything off of the exchange sites, which unfortunately is one of the downfall of bitcoins and their users. The exchanges can be seen as banks, and the hackers robbers. If bitcoins had some sort of legitimate laws behind them to protect consumers who purchase them, then the law could go after the hackers. 
  
Due to the nature of how people view this new technology though, you can get robbed from and noone can do anything about it.

I'm seriously sitting here waiting too..I've been chilling with money in my bank account waiting for the crash so I can restock..but holy shit..it keeps going up...:/

There was a "company" called "arizona mining project" that I happened to drop 250 bucks on (at the time, bout 5 BCT) at the expense that they would "double my profits from their rigs producing BCT...needless to say they had a giant list of people who signed up. They put everyone up on the website..and then suddenly vanished. I recieved an email from the "owner" who said his "life long business partner suddenly vanished with all the money"...
 
That also includes I guess..shutting the website down, and the email address they were using to communicate.
 
I felt hornswaggled..to say the least.

Question: I'm a new dude getting into bitcoin. I had 4 coins I was sitting on, 2 weeks ago I sold 3 of them for a bit of financial gain and now see they have almost doubled in price from when I sold them..so I reinvested some of my savings and the money that I got back from them due to the price going up. (Hopefully a wise investment)
  
My question is: If I offer a service and the customer wants to pay in USD..but I want it to be accepted into bitcoins is there any sort of app or marketplace where I can just charge their card and it automatically transfer the amount in USD that they paid me into bitcoins and it goes into my wallet??

So I'm hoping for an update from your investment since bitcoin right now is skyrocketing. $50,000 worth 2 months ago was roughly about 1000BTC...that same amount now is worth roughly $336,000...a 672% gain.
Whats the status chief?

This is pretty unfortunate..:/ I know coinbase provides a way to request funds/buy coins with USD...I guess I was just hoping it was easy to be able to provide bitcoin as a service for charges and make it easy on the customer to buy/send bitcoins.
