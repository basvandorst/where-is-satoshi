I've made dozens of orders with Newegg and never had an issue. It's just the vocal few who've had bad experiences. I'm sure you're a small percentage of total experiences with majority being good.

Objective-C? Fuck that.

Good argument but if we placed 50,000$ into a storage box that was unbreakable and the only way to gain access was a key, would you say that the key itself is 50,000$? I'd have to go with no.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:37:06
So then why do we bother transferring coins when I can just give you a key and say, "I swear the key unlocks a safe with 50,000$ in it"?
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:19:51
So then the key is only a means to gaining access and does not hold value itself. I rest my case.
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:34:41
Ah okay. Yeah I don't have any experience with those aspects.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:13:12
Right. You were suggesting to avoid sending small amounts because of the current high fees. My point is that we'll be unable to avoid that in the future because small amounts will be the majority of transactions. I'm not saying I have a solution but this seems like a very large issue that should be addressed asap if Bitcoin is to succeed.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:47:40
Wouldn't that be an issue 10 years from now? Sending small amounts  will be the norm, I imagine.

It was from dwolla to mt gox but I actually haven't made the transfer because of their 30 day transaction history policy.
@_date: 2012-07-17 00:47:59
Dang, oh well. I'm trying to buy up bitcoin for now anyways but this damn 30 day thing is slowing me down. Enjoy your miner!

I don't believe the require it any more. I recently signed up and don't even have a Facebook and didn't have any problems.

Very nice minimalistic website! After a quick look through the one thing I think is missing is an obvious display of the current market price for BTC on the charts page. Also, looking forward to being able to purchase BTC from the website.
@_date: 2012-08-29 02:31:52
Could be a crackhead...
@_date: 2012-07-16 23:42:40
Hmm, know of a better service to transfer money back and forth?

I see you don't have your indoor temps registering just yet, but was wondering if it is actually enough to keep the indoor temperature up?
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:46:15
Nope, seems they still have the old price.

I generated a new address through the client but it wasn't the address I used before. Either way though I looks like the client is showing the coins I was looking for now that it's almost sycned. The transactions doesn't show up but I have the coins. Thanks for all the help!
@_date: 2013-08-21 16:42:42
Very cool. Might be worth xposting to some hacker subreddit.

Where is this magical place were electricity is free? University maybe?

Dear FSM, please pop this bubble already!
@_date: 2013-08-06 00:29:54
Right. My issue is, I created a back up, generated a new address, moved some coins to it, and then reformatted and forgot to create a backup before. So the backup I have does not have the address I created after it.
So I have the address and the wallet.dat that does not contain the address.
@_date: 2013-02-02 06:02:54
How is it possible to know the solution before you know the problem? Or is it because it's theoretically possible to know every solution to every possible problem?
@_date: 2013-08-05 19:00:54
@_date: 2013-01-23 16:32:12
Well then I'm very confused with your above comment. Are you getting more?
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:04:58
Would be nice if my purchases weren't getting flagged as high risky! Even though I've purchased multiply times with them, bastards.
@_date: 2013-01-23 16:11:58
A couple equals 2, a few equals 3.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:17:44
Chase bank in the US. I honestly think they were just being shady because I tried buying a couple days when the price was around $65/btc. Best they cancel my purchase and make me buy in at a higher price. It wasn't even a large buy and like I said I had purchased from them multiple times before so something doesn't add up.
@_date: 2013-08-05 19:22:46
Okay, the block chain is still syncing so I'll wait for that and if no success I'll try the -rescan.
I don't have the new wallet anymore, it was lost in the reformat, so I don't think that's an option anymore.
Thanks for the suggestions. I'll let you know if it works.
@_date: 2013-08-06 11:47:34
Okay, so it sounds like I just need to click New Address in the client and it should generate the same address I used. I'll give it a try when I get a chance. I'll let you know if it works.
@_date: 2013-01-23 05:47:12
That's pretty awesome. I need to get me a solar powered property, haha.
@_date: 2013-08-05 19:52:48
I haven't done many, perhaps 10 or so. Still syncing... 64k blocks to go.

I bought some bitcoins today through BitInstant and it was extremely quick. I had my coins by the time I came home from the Currency Exchange. Sure as hell beats getting them from Coinbase.
