Blockchain technology doesn't equal Bitcoin. Blockchain technology doesn't need Bitcoin to be successful.

Supply chain monitoring is one area that is frequently mentioned. The benefit of blockchain is that it's decentralized with  a model based around public verifiability.  Also unlike traditional databases that follow a CRUD model, it's append only.  All previous data is permanently stored and cannot be altered.  Therefore it is traceable.   The benefit comes when products move through multiple organizations and across the globe.  It provides a backbone that manufacturers, shippers and customers can all utilize to aggregate data, analyze trends, and perform predictive monitoring.  Food safety would be one industry that could benefit as it would be easier to identify the source of contaminated products. For instance, if a common platform using blockchain was used throughout the industry - we may have discovered the source of the current Romaine lettuce that is contaminated with E.coli.  Instead of customers, grocery stores, distribution centers, etc disposing of all of the product and take a loss in the process - they could focus on a specific origin and mitigate much of their losses.

Don't forget that if you live in the U.S. (and most other countries) that you will need to file capital gains or risk committing tax fraud
