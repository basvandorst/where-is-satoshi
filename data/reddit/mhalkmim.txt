It is crazy. I just wanted to buy an expensive watch but couldn't justify it. Instead I put the money in bitcoin. Now I have enough to buy the watch and still have my initial investment.

You need to change your mindset. No amount of money would stop you from felling regretful. Be happy you bought and move on.

None because you didn't. Stop with the "what if" and invest some now.

Stop looking at the minute price chart. You are only seeing noise.

excellent, how much do I owe you?

so what do you recommend?

My opinion is if you have no btc at all, buy some. Now, if you already have bitcoin and want to buy more because of the fomo, don't. We are in a very volatile time.

At least where I live, buy land is not a good investment. It has low liquidity, and there are better ways to allocate your money.
Now, if you talking about buying a house to live. that is another history. I don't see that as a investment.

You don't lose if you never sell.

Having a clear understand of what you want to accomplish. How to accomplish is easy once you know where you want to get. It may take longer if you are a newbie tho...
