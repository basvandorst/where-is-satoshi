It was posted on their FB page and they confirmed it. Comments in Danish though. 
In Danish: "Du har fået fat i en intern artikel fra vores erhvervsafdeling, som forklarer, hvorfor vi ikke ønsker at deltage i noget, der har med Bitcoins at gøre. Det skyldes, som der også står, at man kan lave transaktioner uden at afsløre, hvem man er - og derfor kan vi som beskrevet ikke stå inde for midlernes oprindelse - og det skal vi kunne."
Google translate: "You've got hold of an internal article from our business department, which explains why we do not want to participate in anything that has to do with Bitcoins. The reason is that there also is that you can make transactions without revealing who you are - and therefore we described not vouch for the source of funds - and we should be able to."

Honestly, I should have waited the 12-14 hours it took for them to confirm it before posting. I usually have better standards when it comes to critique of sources I find online...

That's true but the volume is also larger making the investment  in new compliance processes worth it. Maybe they'll reconsider if it makes a better business case in the future? 
Edit: Perhaps my point was not clear: I'm just sayin that there is some fixed costs associated with implementing new compliance processes for bitcoin. We are talk staff training, new hires, creating the new processes and implementing new IT systems for supporting them. That could quite likely outweigh any short term profits bitcoin trade would generate.

It was just confirmed.

I don't think it is a stretch for them to be scared of the implications of money laundering, drug trafficking etc through bitcoin. It can be costly for them to apply current compliance regulation on bitcoin and they have probably weighed those costs against possible income from the business bitcoin would generate. Even though bitcoin is not covered by laws about money laundering and terror financing in the same way as bank transactions as soon as any funds hit a bank account, the bank will have to know about where they came from.

Wuhu! I feel vindicated! :)

Did you read the article? It specifically says that the Danish government will allow only certain businesses to refuse accepting cash. Removing the hassle of accepting cash can benefit both businesses and consumers. There are no plans of abolishing all cash anytime soon and no one is forcing either businesses or consumers hands to do away with cash.

Maybe they want the legal precedent?

It might be though I would assume he had some money to spend of his own too. Not sure if he took party money also. They have PR in Sweden so if your party does well you just have to do better than other candidates from your own party. That's slightly simplified but it gets the idea across.

It will be interesting if bitcoin will be hit by similar anti laundering legislation.
