"I have seen many storms in my life. Most storms have caught me by surprise, so I had to learn very quickly to look further and understand that I am not capable of controlling the weather, to exercise the art of patience and to respect the fury of nature. "  Paulo Coelho

Even though the United States officially does not recognize Bitcoin as a currency on a federal level, individuals are being arrested  for not being registered as a Money Service Business with FINCEN.  In some cases they are registered, so they get the seller for being a Money Transmitter.  
Some cases have been thrown out by the judge, but Feds hope for asset forfeiture and for the plaintiff to plead guilty for lower fine/jail time.

* Segwit opened the door to destroy most alts.
* Lightning is faster than most alts and can also act as a means of privacy.
* Once Rootstock comes with smart contracts, that's another stomp on Altcoins.

Max Keiser and Crypto Sniper Francis Hunt have also touched on the devaluation of the USD and the pump of the equities market to compensate.  Both agree that it will not end well.
Similar happened to the dollar in the late 80's resulting in Black Monday's 22% crash in 1987.

“Crypto Compatriots,
Tears fill my eyes as I gaze through the ranks... So many comrades have fallen. The 2018 bear market has taken more than lives, it destroyed hopes and dreams.
The honey badger may be beaten up and weary, but he's still standing.
Speaking of Badger, let's see what future lies for our broken hero.
Bit followed the long path at the feet of Mt King, too tired to climb, and still determined enough not to give in the sands of the desert of despair. He walked straight for as long as he could. Unfortunately, the road came to an abrupt end. A wall of rocky mountains stood firm ahead, forcing Badger to change directions. His only option was to head south, getting dangerously closer to the dreaded Reklands. home of the infamous Lord Rekt.”
